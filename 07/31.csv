Lifshitz point was recently put forth by Horava (arXiv:0901.3775), and has been
since dubbed as Horava-Lifshitz gravity. The theory explicitly breaks Lorentz
invariance, which introduces an apparent extra scalar degree of freedom. In
this note, we show that the low energy limit of (non-projectible)
Horava-Lifshitz gravity is uniquely given by the quadratic cuscuton model: a
covariant scalar field theory with an infinite speed of sound and a quadratic
potential, which is minimally coupled to Einstein gravity. This implies that
the extra scalar is non-dynamical to all orders in perturbation theory. Using
current cosmological constraints on the quadratic cuscuton model, we can
constrain the low energy Lorentz breaking parameter of Horava-Lifshitz theory
(which leads to a running of Planck mass on the Hubble scale) to |lambda-1| <
0.014 (at 95% confidence level). We also point out that, with reasonable
boundary conditions, the spatial hypersurfaces in this theory are constant mean
curvature (CMC) or uniform expansion surfaces at low energies, and introduce
geometrical symmetries that can protect the non-dynamical nature of these
theories from quantum corrections. We also notice that the theory with lambda <
1 might suffer from a non-perturbative UV instability.

This HAC `excess' suggests compact nuclei with steep temperature gradients as
opposed to predominantly host obscuration. Beside the above molecular
absorption features, we detect the 3.3um PAH emission feature in one of our

analysis suggests that water ice, hydrocarbons, and PAH are likely present in
the bulk of this sample even when not individually detected. The most
unexpected result of our study is the lack of clear detections of the 4.67um CO
gas absorption feature. Only three of the sources show tentative signs of this
feature and at significantly lower levels than has been observed in local
ULIRGs. Overall, we find that the closest local analogs to our sources, in
terms of 3-4um color, HAC-to-silicate and ice-to-silicate ratios, as well as
low PAH equivalent widths are sources dominated by deeply obscured nuclei. Such
sources form only a small fraction of ULIRGs locally and are commonly believed
to be dominated by buried AGN. Our sample suggests that, in absolute number,
such buried AGN are at least an order of magnitude more common at z~2 than
today. The presence of PAH suggests that significant levels of star-formation
are present even if the obscured AGN typically dominate the power budget.

rather two dimensional, the outer one presenting a strong three dimensional
character. The structure of the electron pockets is clarified by studying high
doping contents, where they are enlarged. They are found to be essentially
circular and two dimensional. From the size of the pockets, we deduce the
number of holes and electrons present at the various dopings. We find that the
net number of carriers is in good agreement with the bulk stoichiometry, but
that the number of each species (holes and electrons) is smaller than predicted
by theory. Finally, we discuss the quality of nesting in the different regions
of the phase diagram. The presence of the third hole pocket significantly
weakens the nesting at x=0, so that it may not be a crucial ingredient in the
formation of the Spin Density Wave. On the other hand, superconductivity seems

AGNs. We investigated 1,809 AGNs, which is about ten times larger a sample than
that used in previous studies on AGN-galaxy clustering at redshifts larger than
0.6. 90% of the AGN samples are optically-selected AGN from the SDSS and 2dF
catalogs. The galaxy samples at low redshift includes many redder objects from
UKIDSS survey, while at higher redshift they are mainly blue galaxies from
Suprime-Cam. We found significant excess of galaxies around the AGNs at
redshifts from 0.3 to 1.8. For the low redshift samples ($z<0.9$), we obtained
correlation length of $r_{0} = $5--6 $h^{-1}$Mpc ($\gamma = 1.8$), which
indicates that the AGNs at this redshift range reside in a similar environment
around typical local galaxies. We also found that AGNs at higher redshift
ranges reside in a denser environment than lower redshift AGNs; For $z=1.3 \sim
1.8$ AGNs, the cross correlation length was measured as 11$^{+6}_{-3}$
$h^{-1}$Mpc ($\gamma=1.8$). Considering that our galaxies sample is based on
optical observations with Suprime-Cam at the redshift range, it is expected
that blue star-forming galaxies comprise the majority of objects that are
observed to be clustered around the AGNs. It is successfully demonstrated that
the use of the archive through the Virtual Observatory system can provide a
powerful tool for investigating the small scale environment of the intermediate
redshift AGNs.

Anderson model of a magnetic impurity level that hybridizes with a metallic

bosonic bath having a spectral density proportional to \omega^s. As the
impurity-bath coupling increases from zero, the effective Coulomb interaction
between two electrons in the impurity level is progressively renormalized from
its repulsive bare value until it eventually becomes attractive. For weak
hybridization, this renormalization in turn produces a crossover from a
conventional, spin-sector Kondo effect to a charge Kondo effect. At
particle-hole symmetry, and for sub-Ohmic bath exponents 0 < s < 1, further
increase of the impurity-bath coupling results in a continuous,
zero-temperature transition to a broken-symmetry phase in which the
ground-state impurity occupancy \n_d acquires an expectation value <\n_d>_0 \ne
1. The response of the impurity occupancy to a locally applied electric
potential features the hyperscaling of critical exponents and \omega/T scaling
that are expected at an interacting critical point. The numerical values of the
critical exponents suggest that the transition lies in the same universality
class as that of the sub-Ohmic spin-boson model. For the Ohmic case s = 1, the
transition is instead of Kosterlitz-Thouless type. Away from particle-hole
symmetry, the quantum phase transition is replaced by a smooth crossover, but
signatures of the symmetric quantum critical point remain in the physical
properties at elevated temperatures and/or frequencies.

channel codes, source codes and physical layer network codes for Gaussian
channels. For Gaussian channels with secrecy constraints, however, efforts to
date rely on random codes. In this work, we advocate that structured codes are
useful for providing secrecy, and show how to compute the secrecy rate when
structured codes are used. In particular, we solve the problem of bounding
equivocation rates with one important class of structured codes, i.e., nested
lattice codes. Having established this result, we next demonstrate the use of
structured codes for secrecy in two-user Gaussian channels. In particular, with
structured codes, we prove that a positive secure degree of freedom is
achievable for a large class of fully connected Gaussian channels as long as
the channel is not degraded. By way of this, for these channels, we establish
that structured codes outperform Gaussian random codes at high SNR. This class
of channels include the two-user multiple access wiretap channel, the two-user
interference channel with confidential messages and the two-user interference
wiretap channel. A notable consequence of this result is that, unlike the case
with Gaussian random codes, using structured codes for both transmission and
cooperative jamming, it is possible to achieve an arbitrary large secrecy rate
given enough power.

propagates. In this paper, we first derive a new form of four-momentum
conservation that connects the four-momentum $(E_{\alpha},~p_{\alpha})$ of the
neutrino flavor eigenstate and the four momenta $(E_i,~p_i)$ of its mass
eigen-components. Then we use the assumption that the mass eigen-components
travel at equal velocity to derive the energy-momentum square difference (EMSD)
$E_{\alpha}^2-p_{\alpha}^2$ for the flavor eigenstate. It is shown that for the
equal velocity assumption, $E_{\alpha}^2-p_{\alpha}^2$ will be a fixed constant
in events with different $E_{\alpha}$ and/or $p_{\alpha}$. In contrast, for the
equal energy or equal momentum assumption, $E_{\alpha}^2-p_{\alpha}^2$ will
vary with $E_{\alpha}$ or $p_{\alpha}$ respectively. These EMSD can be checked
by ongoing and future neutrino experiments. The phase difference between two
neutrino mass eigen-components $|\nu_i\rangle$ and $|\nu_j\rangle$ is then
derived for the equal velocity assumption. For relativistic neutrinos, it is
shown that the phase difference depends linearly on the distance energy ratio
$L/E$, the mass difference $m_i-m_j$ and an effective mass, in contrary to the
linear dependance on $L/E$ and $m_i^2-m_j^2$ as the phase difference for equal
energy or equal momentum assumption dose. The new phase difference implies
different bounds on the neutrino masses or mass difference.

observed PAMELA positron excess and satisfy relic density constraints in the
extended class of models due to a near degeneracy of the mass spectrum of the
extended neutralino sector with the LSP mass. The simultaneous satisfaction of
the WMAP relic density data and the PAMELA data is accomplished through a
co-annihilation mechanism ($B_{\rm Co}-mechanism$), and leads to predictions of

designing architectures for fair resource allocation to meet long-term

propose a model for incorporating the quality of service (QoS) requirements of

fairly allocates resources to meet the fairness objectives of both elastic and

place. The expected signal of neutrinos from a nearby supernova is calculated.
The supernova often explodes inside a dense circumstellar medium, which is
established due to the progenitor star losing its outermost envelope in a

O_H, O_y, O_g, and O_gamma, which contribute to the production and decay of the
Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), among other things. Assuming
the Higgs is a fundamental scalar, we find: 1) the coefficient of O_H is
positive except when there are triplet scalars, resulting in a reduction in the
Higgs on-shell coupling from their standard model (SM) expectations if no other
operators contribute, 2) the linear combination of O_H and O_y controlling the
overall Higgs coupling to fermion is always reduced, 3) the sign of O_g induced
by a new colored fermion is such that it interferes destructively with the SM
top contribution in the gluon fusion production of the Higgs, if the new
fermion cancels the top quadratic divergence in the Higgs mass, and 4) the
correlation between naturalness and the sign of O_gamma is similar to that of
O_g, when there is a new set of heavy electroweak gauge bosons. Next
considering a composite scalar for the Higgs, we find the reduction in the
on-shell Higgs couplings persists. If further assuming a collective breaking
mechanism as in little Higgs theories, the coefficient of O_H remains positive
even in the presence of triplet scalars. In the end, we conclude that the gluon
fusion production of the Higgs boson is reduced from the SM rate in all
composite Higgs models. Our study suggests a wealth of information could be
revealed by precise measurements of the Higgs couplings, providing strong
motivations for both improving on measurements at the LHC and building a
precision machine such as the linear collider.

zCOSMOS-bright 10k spectroscopic sample. We investigate the total MF and the
contribution of ETGs and LTGs, defined by different criteria (SED, morphology
or star formation). We unveil a galaxy bimodality in the global MF, better
represented by 2 Schechter functions dominated by ETGs and LTGs, respectively.
For the global population we confirm that low-mass galaxies number density
increases later and faster than for massive galaxies. We find that the MF
evolution at intermediate-low values of Mstar (logM<10.6) is mostly explained
by the growth in stellar mass driven by smoothly decreasing star formation
activities. The low residual evolution is consistent with ~0.16 merger per
galaxy per Gyr (of which fewer than 0.1 are major). We find that ETGs increase
in number density with cosmic time faster for decreasing Mstar, with a median
""building redshift"" increasing with mass, in contrast with hierarchical models.
For LTGs we find that the number density of blue or spiral galaxies remains
almost constant from z~1. Instead, the most extreme population of active star
forming galaxies is rapidly decreasing in number density. We suggest a
transformation from blue active spirals of intermediate mass into blue
quiescent and successively (1-2 Gyr after) into red passive types. The complete
morphological transformation into red spheroidals, required longer time-scales
or follows after 1-2 Gyr. A continuous replacement of blue galaxies is expected
by low-mass active spirals growing in stellar mass. We estimate that on average
~25% of blue galaxies is transforming into red per Gyr for logM<11. We conclude
that the build-up of galaxies and ETGs follows the same downsizing trend with
mass as the formation of their stars, converse to the trend predicted by
current SAMs. We expect a negligible evolution of the global Galaxy Baryonic
MF.

methods involve oxidation of graphene and introduce defects in the as-made
sheets. Hydrazine reduction at 100 has shown to partially restore the structure
and conductance of graphite oxide. However, the reduced GO still shows strong
defect peaks in Raman spectra with higher resistivity than pristine graphene by
2 to 3 orders of magnitude. It is important to produce much less defective
graphene sheets than GO, and develop more effective graphene reduction.
Recently, we reported a mild exfoliation-reintercalation-expansion method to
form high-quality GS with higher conductivity and lower oxidation degree than
GO.5 Here, we present a 180 solvothermal reduction method for our GS and GO.
The solvothermal reduction is more effective than the earlier reduction methods
in lowering the oxygen and defect levels in GS, increasing the graphene
domains, and bringing the conductivity of GS close to pristine graphene. The
reduced GS possess the highest degree of pristinity among chemically derived
graphene.

[1-5] with zig-zag edges, its energy spectrum collapses to a shell of
degenerate states at the Fermi level (Dirac point) [6-9]. The degeneracy is
proportional to the edge size and can be made macroscopic. This opens up the
possibility to design a strongly correlated electronic system as a function of
fractional filling of the zero-energy shell, in analogy to the fractional
quantum Hall effect in a quasi-two-dimensional electron gas[10], but without
the need for a high magnetic field. In this work we show that electronic
correlations, beyond the Hubbard model[6,7] and mean-field density functional
theory (DFT) [7,8] play a crucial role in determining the nature of the ground
state and the excitation spectrum of triangular graphene quantum dots as a
function of dot size and filling fraction of the shell of zero-energy states.
The interactions are treated by a combination of DFT, tight-binding,
Hartree-Fock and configuration interaction methods (TB-HF-CI) and include all
scattering and exchange terms within second nearest neighbors as well as
interaction with metallic gate. We show that a half filled charge neutral shell
leads to full spin polarization of the island but this magnetic moment is
completely destroyed by the addition of a single electron, in analogy to the
effect of skyrmions on the quantum Hall ferromagnet [11-14] and spin
depolarization in electrostatically defined semiconductor quantum dots[15-18].
The depolarization of the ground state is predicted to result in blocking of
current through a graphene quantum dot due to spin blockade (SB) [18].

  In our scheme, groups are formed after deployment of sensor nodes, on the

limited resources. Due to the shared wireless channel and dynamic topology,
packet transmissions suffer from interference and fading. In heterogeneous ad
hoc networks, throughput via a given route is depending on the minimum data
rate of all its links. In a route of links with various data rates, if a high
data rate node forwards more traffic to a low data rate node, there is a chance
of congestion, which leads to long queuing delays in such routes. Since hop
count is used as a routing metric in traditional routing, it do not adapt well
to mobile nodes. A congestion-aware routing metric for MANETs should
incorporate transmission capability, reliability, and congestion around a link.
In this paper, we propose to develop a hop-by-hop congestion aware routing
protocol which employs a combined weight value as a routing metric, based on
the data rate, queuing delay, link quality and MAC overhead. Among the
discovered routes, the route with minimum cost index is selected, which is
based on the node weight of all the in-network nodes. Simulation results prove
that our proposed routing protocol attains high throughput and packet delivery
ratio, by reducing the packet drop and delay.

mergers between two intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) of comparable mass,
and intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (IMRIs) of smaller compact objects with
mass ~ 1-10 solar masses into IMBHs. IMBHs may form via two channels: (i) in
dark matter halos at high redshift through direct collapse or the collapse of
very massive metal-poor Population III stars, or (ii) via runaway stellar
collisions in globular clusters. In this paper, we will discuss both formation
channels, and both classes of merger in each case. We review existing rate

Unlike conventional designs in CR-Nets, in this paper it is assumed that the
Channel State Information (CSI) for all relevant channels is imperfectly known,
and the imperfectness of the CSI is modeled using an Euclidean ball-shaped
uncertainty set. Our design objective is to minimize the transmit power of the
SU-Transmitter (SU-Tx) while simultaneously targeting a lower bound on the
received Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise-Ratio (SINR) for the SU's, and
imposing an upper limit on the Interference-Power (IP) at the PUs. The design
parameters at the SU-Tx are the beamforming weights, i.e. the precoder matrix.
The proposed methodology is based on a worst case design scenario through which
the performance metrics of the design are immune to variations in the channels.
We propose three approaches based on convex programming for which efficient
numerical solutions exist. Finally, simulation results are provided to validate
the robustness of the proposed methods.

of stellar evolution theory, bridging the gap between the hot, massive stars
and the cool red supergiants. But, this region of the color-magnitude diagram
is dominated by foreground contamination, requiring membership to somehow be
determined. Fortunately, the large negative systemic velocity of M31, coupled
to its high rotation rate, provides the means for separating the contaminating
foreground dwarfs from the bona fide yellow supergiants within M31. Using the
MMT, we obtained spectra of about 2900 stars, selected using the color and
magnitude range to be yellow supergiants. Comparing the velocities to that of
M31's rotation curve, we identified 54 certain, and 66 probable yellow
supergiants from among the sea of foreground dwarfs. We find excellent
agreement between the location of yellow supergiants in the H-R diagram and
that predicted by the latest Geneva evolutionary tracks which include rotation.
However, the relative number of yellow supergiants seen as a function of mass
varies from that predicted by the models by a factor of more than 10, in the
sense that more high mass yellow supergiants are predicted than are actually
observed. Comparing the total number of yellow supergiants with masses above
20Mo with the estimated number of unevolved O stars indicates that the duration
of the yellow supergiant phase is about 3000 years. This is consistent with
what the 12Mo and 15Mo evolutionary tracks predict, but disagrees with the
20,000-80,000 year time scales predicted by the models for higher masses.

smooth G-manifold f over the space B of objects of G, the resulting
G-equivariant de Rham theory of f boils down to the ordinary equivariant de
Rham theory of a vertex manifold relative to the corresponding vertex group,
for any vertex in the space B of objects of G; this implies that the
equivariant de Rham cohomology introduced here coincides with the stack de Rham
cohomology of the associated transformation groupoid whence this stack de Rham
cohomology can be characterized as a relative derived functor. We introduce a
notion of cone on a Lie-Rinehart algebra and in particular that of cone on a
Lie algebroid. This cone is an indispensable tool for the description of the
requisite monads.

frequencies seen in the broad band power spectra from black hole and neutron
star binaries. We use the truncated disc/hot inner flow geometry, and assume
that the hot flow is generically turbulent. Each radius in the hot flow
produces fluctuations, and we further assume that these are damped on the
viscous frequency. Integrating over radii gives broad band continuum noise
power between low and high frequency breaks which are set by the viscous
timescale at the outer and inner edge of the hot flow, respectively.
Lense-Thirring (vertical) precession of the entire hot flow superimposes the
low frequency QPO on this continuum power.
  We test this model on the power spectra seen in the neutron star systems
(atolls) as these have the key advantage that the (upper) kHz QPO most likely
independently tracks the truncation radius. These show that this model can give
a consistent solution, with the truncation radius decreasing from 20-8 Rg while
the inner radius of the flow remains approximately constant at ~4.5 Rg i.e. 9.2
km. We use this very constrained geometry to predict the low frequency QPO from
Lense-Thirring precession of the entire hot flow from r_o to r_i. The simplest
assumption of a constant surface density in the hot flow matches the observed
QPO frequency to within 25 per cent. This match can be made even better by
considering that the surface density should become increasingly centrally
concentrated as the flow collapses into an optically thick boundary layer
during the spectral transition. The success of the model opens up the way to
use the broad band power spectra as a diagnostic of accretion flows in strong
gravity.

hypothesized to explain this unusual behavior: (1) 133P is a classical comet
from the outer solar system that has evolved onto a main-belt orbit, or (2)
133P is a dynamically ordinary main-belt asteroid on which subsurface ice has
recently been exposed. If (1) is correct, the expected rarity of a dynamical
transition onto an asteroidal orbit implies that 133P could be alone in the
main belt. In contrast, if (2) is correct, other icy main-belt objects should
exist and could also exhibit cometary activity. Believing 133P to be a
dynamically ordinary, yet icy main-belt asteroid, I set out to test the primary
prediction of the hypothesis: that 133P-like objects should be common and could
be found by an appropriately designed observational survey. I conducted just
such a survey -- the Hawaii Trails Project -- of selected main-belt asteroids
in a search for objects displaying cometary activity. I made 657 observations
of 599 asteroids, discovering one active object now known as 176P/LINEAR,
leading to the identification of the new cometary class of main-belt comets.
These results suggest that there could be ~100 currently active main-belt
comets among low-inclination, kilometer-scale outer belt asteroids. Physically
and statistically, main-belt comet activity is consistent with initiation by
meter-sized impactors. The estimated rate of impacts and sizes of resulting
active sites, however, imply that 133P-sized bodies should become significantly
devolatilized over Gyr timescales, suggesting that 133P, and possibly the other
MBCs as well, could be secondary, or even multigenerational, fragments from
recent breakup events.

ferromagnet, which is realized in a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in a
perpendicular magnetic field at Landau level filling factor equal one. We study
the problem by projecting the original fermionic Hamiltonian into magnon
states, which behave as bosons in the vicinity of the ferromagnetic ground
state. The approach permits the reformulation of a strongly interacting model
into a non-interacting one. The latter is a non-perturbative scheme that
consists in treating the two-particle neutral excitations of the electron
system as a bosonic single-particle. Indeed, the employment of bosonization
facilitates the inclusion of disorder in the study of the system. It has been
shown previously that disorder may drive a quantum phase transition in the Hall
ferromagnet. However, such studies have been either carried out in the
framework of nonlinear sigma model, as an effective low-energy theory, or
included the long-range Coulomb interaction in a quantum description only up to
the Hartree-Fock level. Here, we establish the occurrence of a disorder-driven
quantum phase transition from a ferromagnetic 2DEG to a spin glass phase by
taking into account interactions between electrons up to the random phase
approximation level in a fully quantum description.

sparse and powerful unidirectional projections to CA3 pyramidal cells, the
so-called mossy fibers. Mossy fiber synapses appear to duplicate, in terms of
the information they convey, what CA3 cells already receive from entorhinal
cortex layer II cells, which project both to the dentate gyrus and to CA3.
Computational models of episodic memory have hypothesized that the function of
the mossy fibers is to enforce a new, well separated pattern of activity onto
CA3 cells, to represent a new memory, prevailing over the interference produced
by the traces of older memories already stored on CA3 recurrent collateral
connections. Can this hypothesis apply also to spatial representations, as
described by recent neurophysiological recordings in rats? To address this
issue quantitatively, we estimate the amount of information DG can impart on a
new CA3 pattern of spatial activity, using both mathematical analysis and
computer simulations of a simplified model. We confirm that, also in the
spatial case, the observed sparse connectivity and level of activity are most
appropriate for driving memory storage and not to initiate retrieval.
Surprisingly, the model also indicates that even when DG codes just for space,
much of the information it passes on to CA3 acquires a non-spatial and episodic
character, akin to that of a random number generator. It is suggested that
further hippocampal processing is required to make full spatial use of DG
inputs.

relation with the visible matter. In this paper, we explore if extremely
low-mass dwarf galaxies follow the same BTF relation as high-mass galaxies. We
quantify the scatter in the BTF relation and use this to constrain the allowed
elongations of dark matter halo potentials. We obtained HI synthesis data of 11

rotation velocity. Constructing a BTF relation using data from the literature
for the high-mass end, and galaxies with detected rotation from our sample for
the low-mass end results in a BTF with a scatter of 0.33 mag. This scatter
constrains the ellipticities of the potentials in the plane of the disks of the
galaxies to an upper limit of 0-0.06 indicating that dwarf galaxies are at most
only mildly tri-axial. Our results indicate that the BTF relation is a

This formulation supports different tissues grouped as universality classes.

Our
implementation of the CNOT uses Rydberg blockade interactions between neutral
atoms held in optical traps separated by >8 \mu\rm m. We measure CNOT
fidelities of F=0.73 and 0.72 using two different gate protocols, and show by
measurement of parity oscillations that the gate can be used to generate
two-atom states with fidelity at the threshold for entanglement. We anticipate
that the long range nature of the Rydberg interaction will be attractive for
future extensions of this work to multi-qubit systems.

the warped AdS_3 black hole. According to our calculation, the cross section
reduces to the horizon area in the low energy limit as usually expected in
contrast to what was previously found. We also calculate the greybody factor
and find that the effective temperatures for the two chiral CFT's are
consistent with that derived from the quasinormal modes. Observing the
conjectured warped AdS/CFT correspondence, we suspect that a specific sector of
the CFT operators with the desired conformal dimension could be responsible for
the peculiar thermal behaviour of the warped AdS_3 black hole.

zinc-blende-type quantum wells grown on (110)-oriented substrate. It is shown
that, in asymmetric structures, the relaxation of electron spin initially
oriented along the growth direction is characterized by two different lifetimes
and leads to the appearance of an in-plane spin component. The magnitude and
sign of the in-plane component are determined by the structure inversion
asymmetry of the quantum well and can be tuned by the gate voltage. In an
external magnetic field, the interplay of cyclotron motion of carriers and the
Larmor precession of electron spin can result in a nonmonotonic dependence of
the spin density on the magnetic field.

monotonically rolling down its potential. Making use of the {\em
