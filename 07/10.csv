ultra-high energy cosmic rays that relies on the anisotropy patterns measured
as a function of energy. In particular, we show that if one records an
anisotropy signal produced by heavy nuclei of charge Z above an energy E_{thr},
one should record an even stronger (possibly much stronger) anisotropy at
energies >E_{thr}/Z due to the proton component that is expected to be
associated with the sources of the heavy nuclei. This conclusion remains robust
with respect to the parameters characterizing the sources and it does not
depend at all on the modelling of astrophysical magnetic fields. As a concrete
example, we apply this test to the most recent data of the Pierre Auger
Observatory. Assuming that the anisotropy reported above 55EeV is not a
statistical accident, and that no significant anisotropy has been observed at
energies <10EeV, we show that the apparent clustering toward Cen A cannot be
attributed to heavy nuclei. Similar conclusions are drawn regarding the
apparent excess correlation with nearby active galactic nuclei. We then discuss
a robust lower bound to the magnetic luminosity that a source must possess in
order to be able to accelerate particles of charge Z up to 100EeV,
L_B>10^{45}Z^{-2}erg/s. Using this bound in conjunction with the above
conclusions, we argue that the current PAO data does not support the model of
cosmic ray origin in active radio-quiet or even radio-loud galaxies. Finally,
we demonstrate that the apparent clustering in the direction of Cen A can be
explained by the contribution of the last few gamma-ray bursts or magnetars in
the host galaxy thanks to the scattering of the cosmic rays on the magnetized
lobes.

either an artificial viscosity contribution or an appropriate Riemann solver
algorithm. These techniques are necessary to solve the strictly hyperbolic
Euler equations if flow discontinuities (the Riemann problem) must be solved. A
necessary dissipation is normally used in such cases. An explicit artificial
viscosity contribution is normally adopted to smooth out spurious heating and
to treat transport phenomena. Such a treatment of inviscid flows is also widely
adopted in the Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) finite volume free
Lagrangian scheme. In other cases, the intrinsic dissipation of Godunov - type
methods is implicitly useful. Instead ""shock tracking"" methods normally use the
Rankine - Hugoniot jump conditions to solve such problem. A simple, effective
solution of the Riemann problem in inviscid ideal gases is here proposed, based
on an empirical reformulation of the equation of state (EoS) in the Euler
equations in fluid dynamics, whose limit for a motionless gas coincides with
the classical EoS of ideal gases. The application of such effective solution of
the Riemann problem excludes any dependence, in the transport phenomena, on

ansatz leads to an antiferromagnetic ground state at half filling with a

theory). Away from half filling, we find d-wave superconductivity, but confined
to densities where the Fermi surface passes through the antiferromagnetic zone
boundary (if hopping between both nearest-neighbour and next-nearest-neighbour
sites is considered). Our results agree surprisingly well with recent numerical
studies using the Quantum Cluster method. An interesting trend is found by
comparing gap parameters (antiferromagnetic or superconducting) obtained with
different variational wave functions. They vary by an order of magnitude and
thus cannot be taken as a characteristic energy scale. In contrast, the order
parameter is much less sensitive to the degree of sophistication of the
variational schemes, at least at and near half filling.

studied. Therein the main result is that the value function V solves the HJB
equation and has continuous classical derivative in the direction of the
present. The goal of the present paper is to exploit such result to find
optimal feedback strategies for the problem. While it is easy to define
formally a feedback strategy in classical sense the proof of its existence and
of its optimality is hard due to lack of full regularity of V and to the
infinite dimension. Finally, we show some approximation results that allow us
to apply our main theorem to obtain epsilon-optimal strategies for a wider
class of problems.

Graphene grown epitaxially on silicon carbide is particularly attractive in

exhibit all the transport properties of ideal, two-dimensional graphene desired
for device applications. Nevertheless, there is little or no understanding of
the actual kinetics of growth, which is likely to be required for future

mechanism to explain finger-like structures observed when graphene is grown by
step flow decomposition of SiC(0001). Using a continuum equation of motion for
the shape evolution of a moving step, a linear stability analysis predicts
whether a shape perturbation of a straight moving step grows or decays as a
function of growth temperature, the background pressure of Si maintained during
growth, and the effectiveness of an inert buffer gas to retard the escape of Si
atoms from the crystal surface. The theory gives semi-quantitative agreement
with experiment for the characteristic separation between fingers observed when

small, even for a heavy-neutrino mass of order a few hundred GeV. This would
make it unlikely to test the model directly at the LHC, as the amplitude for
producing the heavy neutrino is proportional to the mixing size. However, it

logarithmic deviations from finite-size scaling exist in d=3 dimensions for
Neumann and Dirichlet b.c.. This is explained in terms of the borderline
dimension d*=3, where the critical exponent of the Gaussian surface energy
density vanishes. For Neumann-Dirichlet b.c., finite-size scaling is strongly
violated above T_c for 1<d<4. Our results include an exact description of the
dimensional crossover between the d-dimensional finite-size critical behavior
near bulk T_c and the (d-1)-dimensional critical behavior near T_c,film(L).
This dimensional crossover is illustrated for the critical behavior of the
specific heat. For 2<d<4, the Gaussian results are reformulated as one-loop
contributions of the phi^4 theory at fixed dimension and are compared with the
epsilon=4-d expansion results as well as with d=3 Monte Carlo data. For d=2,
the Gaussian results for the Casimir force scaling function are compared with
those for the Ising model; unexpected exact relations are found between the

inclination. In this work, we studied the orbital phase dependent hydrogen
Paschen spectra reflected by the SE lobe of the Homunculus to constrain the

first extend the analysis in the literature and recover all bounds imposed by
causality of the boundary theory in the bulk dynamics for all polarizations of
the graviton and the gauge boson field. These results translate to specific
bounds for the ratio of central charges $\frac{a}{c}$ in the dual CFT, already
found by analyzing the energy one point function. Then, we generalize this
discussion and we study shock wave backgrounds in which we make manifest the
relation between causality in the bulk and the three point function in the dual
field theory. We remark that particular care has to be given to the
exponentiation procedure of the three point function when solving the classical
equations of motion in the higher gravity theory, as it is not clear that every
theory will present causality problems. Finally, we present a field theoretic
argument explaining the positivity of energy condition in any UV complete QFT.

studied. Because electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations are essential for
radiative decay of excited atomic states, decay rates can serve as a measure of
the suppression of vacuum fluctuation in non-classical states, such as squeezed
vacuum states. In such states the renormalized expectation value of the square
of the electric field or the energy density can be periodically negative,
representing suppression of vacuum fluctuations. We explore the extent to which
atomic decays can be used to measure the mean squared electric field or energy
density. We consider a scheme in which atoms in an excited state transit a
closed cavity whose lowest mode contains photons in a non-classical state. The
change in the decay probability of the atom in the cavity due to the
non-classical state can, under certain circumstances, serve as a measure of the
mean squared electric field or energy density in the cavity. We derive a
quantum inequality bound on the decrease in this probability. We also show that
the decrease in decay rate can sometimes be a measure of negative energy
density or negative squared electric field. We make some estimates of the

induces inevitably codimension-1 distributional terms. We study these
topological matching conditions, together with constraints from the bulk
equations evaluated at the brane position, for two cases of regularisation of
the codimension-2 defect. First, for an arbitrary smooth regularisation of the
defect and second for a ring regularisation which has a cusp in the angular
part of the metric. For a cosmological ansatz, we see that in the first case
the coupled system is not closed and requires input from the bulk equations
away from the brane. The relevant bulk function, which is a time-dependent
angular deficit, describes the energy exchange between the brane and the 6D
bulk. On the other hand, for the ring regularisation case, the system is closed
and there is no leakage of energy in the bulk. We demonstrate that the full set
of matching conditions and field equations evaluated at the brane position are
consistent, correcting some previous claim in the literature which used rather
restrictive assumptions for the form of geometrical quantities close to the
codimension-2 brane. We analyse the modified Friedmann equation and we see that
there are certain corrections coming from the non-zero extrinsic curvature on

possible curvature domination wedged in between the period of matter and

mass - host galaxy bulge luminosity relationship derived from SDSS spectra. The
first is that at a fixed black hole mass, the SDSS spectrum depends strongly on
redshift because an SDSS fiber sees a larger fraction of the total light of
more distant galaxies. The second is that at a given redshift, the fraction of
host-galaxy light in the fiber increases with decreasing galaxy luminosity. We
illustrate the latter effect using the Kormendy et al. (2009) light profiles of
Virgo ellipticals. With allowance for the two effects, we obtain a black hole
mass - bulge luminosity relationship for AGNs which has a scatter of only +/-
0.23 dex in mass. This is less than the scatter found for inactive galaxies,
and is consistent with the measuring errors. We show that there is a
correspondingly tight linear relationship between the fraction of host galaxy
light in AGN spectra and the Eddington ratio. This linearity implies that at a
given black hole mass, the host luminosities of high-accretion-rate AGNs
(NLS1s) and low-accretion-rate AGNs are similar. The relationship between the
fraction of host galaxy light and the Eddington ratio provides a simple means
of estimating the fraction of host galaxy light in AGN spectra. This means that
the real amplitude of variability of low-accretion-rate AGNs is increased
relative to NLS1s.

The models utilize the clumpy torus of Nenkova et al. (2008) and are the first
to allow its consistent check in type-I AGNs. Single torus models and combined
torus-NLR models fail to fit the spectra of most sources but three component
models adequately fit the spectra of all sources. We present torus inclination,
cloud distribution, covering factor and torus mass for all sources and compare
them with bolometric luminosity, black hole mass and accretion rate. The torus
covering factor and mass are found to be correlated with the bolometric
luminosity of the sources. We find that a substantial amount of the ~2-7 um
radiation originates from a hot dust component, which likely situated in the
innermost part of the torus. The luminosity radiated by this component and its
covering factor are comparable to those of the torus. We quantify the emission
by the NLR clouds and estimate their distance from the center. The distances
are ~700 times larger than the dust sublimation radius and the NLR covering
factor is about 0.07. The total covering factor by all components is in good

simulation, we predict the statistical character of variability in the coronal
luminosity from accreting black holes. When the inner boundary of the corona is
defined to be the electron scattering photosphere, its location depends only on
the mass accretion rate in Eddington units (\dot{M}). Nearly independent of
viewing angle and \dot{M}, the power spectrum over the range of frequencies
from approximately the orbital frequency at the innermost stable circular orbit
(ISCO) to ~100 times lower is well approximated by a power-law with index -2,
crudely consistent with the observed power spectra of hard X-ray fluctuations
in AGN and the hard states of Galactic binary black holes. The underlying
physical driver for variability in the light curve is variations in the
accretion rate caused by the chaotic character of MHD turbulence, but the power
spectrum of the coronal light output is significantly steeper. Part of this
contrast is due to the fact that the mass accretion rate can be significantly
modulated by radial epicyclic motions that do not result in dissipation, and
therefore do not drive luminosity fluctuations. The other part of this contrast
is due to the inward decrease of the characteristic inflow time, which leads to
decreasing radial coherence length with increasing fluctuation frequency.

(so-called GMAs) are first assembled and then broken up as the gas flow through
the spiral arms. The GMAs and their H2 molecules are not fully dissociated into
atomic gas as predicted in stellar feedback scenarios, but are fragmented into
smaller GMCs upon leaving the spiral arms. The remnants of GMAs are detected as
the chains of GMCs that emerge from the spiral arms into interarm regions. The
kinematic shear within the spiral arms is sufficient to unbind the GMAs against
self-gravity. We conclude that the evolution of GMCs is driven by large-scale
galactic dynamics --their coagulation into GMAs is due to spiral arm streaming
motions upon entering the arms, followed by fragmentation due to shear as they
leave the arms on the downstream side. In M51, the majority of the gas remains
molecular from arm entry through the inter-arm region and into the next spiral
arm passage.

analysis than an analysis with kmax = 0.1 h/Mpc, as was adopted in the SDSS

spectrum with spectral index n_s and \Omega_b h^2 = 0.02265 fixed, consistent
with CMB measurements. The halo power spectrum also constrains the ratio of the
comoving sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch to an effective distance to
z=0.35: r_s/D_V(0.35) = 0.1097^{+0.0039}_{-0.0042}. Combining the halo power
spectrum measurement with the WMAP 5 year results, for the flat LCDM model we

Acoustic Oscillations are observed in power spectra measured for different

that found in previous analyses of the SDSS DR5 sample, but the discrepancy is
now of lower significance, a change caused by a revised error analysis and a
change in the methodology adopted, as well as the addition of more data. Using
WMAP5 constraints on Omega_bh^2 and Omega_ch^2, and combining our BAO distance

090426, establishing the first firm lower limit to a redshift for a gamma-ray
burst with an observed duration of <2 s. With a rest-frame burst duration of
T_90z = 0.35 s and a detailed examination of the peak energy of the event, we
suggest that this is likely (at >90% confidence) a member of the short/hard
phenomenological class of GRBs. From analysis of the optical-afterglow spectrum
we find that the burst originated along a very low HI column density sightline,
with N_HI < 3.2 x 10^19 cm^-2. Our GRB 090426 afterglow spectrum also appears
to have weaker low-ionisation absorption (Si II, C II) than ~95% of previous
afterglow spectra. Finally, we also report the discovery of a blue, very
luminous, star-forming putative host galaxy (~2 L*) at a small angular offset
from the location of the optical afterglow. We consider the implications of
this unique GRB in the context of burst duration classification and our
understanding of GRB progenitor scenarios.

in W49A obtained at Gemini North, allowing us to identify the driving source of
its powerful H2O maser outflow. These data also confirm our previous report
that several radio sources in the ring are undetected in the mid-IR because
they are embedded deep inside the cloud core. We locate the source of the water
maser outflow at the position of the compact mid-IR peak of source G (source
G:IRS1). This IR source is not coincident with any identified compact radio
continuum source, but is coincident with a hot molecular core, so we propose
that G:IRS1 is a hot core driving an outflow analogous to the wide-angle
bipolar outflow in OMC-1. G:IRS1 is at the origin of a larger bipolar cavity
and CO outflow. The water maser outflow is orthogonal to the bipolar CO cavity,
so the masers probably reside near its waist in the cavity walls. Models of the
IR emission require a massive protostar of 45Msun, 3e5Lsun, and an effective
envelope accretion rate of 1e-3Msun/yr. Feedback from the central star could
potentially drive the H2O maser outflow, but it has insufficient radiative
momentum to have driven the large-scale CO outflow, requiring that this massive
star had an active accretion disk over the past 10^4 yr. Combined with the
spatialy resolved morphology in IR images, G:IRS1 in W49 provides compelling
evidence for a massive protostar that formed by accreting from a disk,
accompanied by a bipolar outflow.

the excess chemical potential and diffusivity of water as a function of depth

atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. The maximum in the excess free energy
of water inside the lipid bilayers is found to be twice that of water in
phospholipid bilayers at the same temperature. Permeability, which decreases
exponentially with the free energy barrier, is reduced by several orders of
magnitude as compared to with phospholipid bilayers. The average time it takes
for a water molecule to cross the bilayer is calculated by solving the
Smoluchowski equation in presence of the free energy barrier. For a bilayer
composed of a 2:2:1 molar ratio of ceramide NS 24:0, cholesterol and free fatty

evolution models that take account of metallicity evolution, extinction

library), we improved our first library and extended it to cover the domain of
most of the SDSS catalogue. We produce an extended library of 28885 synthetic
galaxy spectra at zero redshift covering four general Hubble types of galaxies,
over the wavelength range between 250 and 1050 nm at a sampling of 1 nm or
less. The library is also produced for 4 random values of redshift in the range
of 0-0.2. It is computed on a random grid of four key astrophysical parameters
(infall timescale and 3 parameters defining the SFR) and, depending on the
galaxy type, on two values of the age of the galaxy. The synthetic library was
compared and found to be in good agreement with various observations. The first
results from the SVM classifiers and parametrizers are promising, indicating
that Hubble types can be reliably predicted and several parameters estimated

carbon ion emission provides a negligible contribution, suggesting that solar

results of the model fits to observations support the previously estimated

communication over a wireless shared channel. Motivated by this example, we
study in this paper random walks on hyper-graphs. First, we formalize the
random walk process on hyper-graphs and generalize key notions from random
walks on graphs. We then give the novel definition of radio cover time, namely,
the expected time of a random walk to be heard (as opposed to visit) by all
nodes. We then provide some basic bounds on the radio cover, in particular, we
show that while on graphs the radio cover time is O(mn), in hyper-graphs it is
O(mnr) where n, m and r are the number of nodes, the number of edges and the
rank of the hyper-graph, respectively. In addition, we define radio hitting
times and give a polynomial algorithm to compute them. We conclude the paper
with results on specific hyper-graphs that model wireless networks in one and

discover extended hard X-rays coincident with the bright, extended TeV source
HESS J1731-347 and the shell of the radio SNR. We find that spatially-resolved
X-ray spectra can generally be characterized by an absorbed power-law model,
with photon-index of ~ 2, typical of non-thermal emission. A bright X-ray
compact source, XMMS J173203-344518, is also detected near the center of the
SNR. We find no evidence of a radio counterpart or an extended X-ray morphology
for this source, making it unlikely to be a pulsar wind nebular (PWN). The
spectrum of the source can be well fitted by an absorbed blackbody with a
temperature of ~ 0.5 keV plus a power-law tail with a photon-index of ~ 5,
reminiscent of the X-ray emission of a magnetar. CO observations toward the
inner part of the HESS source reveal a bright cloud component at -20+/-4 km
s^{-1}, which is likely located at the same distance of ~ 3.2 kpc as the SNR.
Based on the probable association between the X-ray and $\gamma$-ray emissions
and likely association between the CO cloud and the SNR, we argue that the
extended TeV emission originates from the interaction between the SNR shock and
the adjacent CO clouds rather than from a PWN.

the theoretical modeling of, aspects of cosmic ray (CR) generation and
propagation in the Galaxy, which are relevant for the interpretation of recent
positron and anti-proton measurements. We give simple, analytic, model
independent expressions for the secondary pbar flux, and an upper limit for the
secondary e+ flux, obtained by neglecting e+ radiative losses, e+/(e+ +
e-)<0.2\pm0.1 up to ~300 GeV. These expressions are completely determined by
the rigidity dependent grammage, which is measured from stable CR secondaries
up to ~150 GeV/nuc, and by nuclear cross sections measured in the laboratory.
pbar and e+ measurements, available up to ~100 GeV, are consistent with these
estimates, implying that there is no need for new, non-secondary, pbar or e+
sources. The radiative loss suppression factor f_{s,e+} of the e+ flux depends
on the e+ propagation in the Galaxy, which is not understood theoretically. A
rough, model independent estimate of f_{s,e+} 1/3 can be obtained at a single
energy, E\sim20 GeV, from unstable secondary decay and is found to be
consistent with e+ measurements, including the positron fraction measured by
PAMELA. We show that specific detailed models, that agree with compositional CR
data, agree with our simple expressions for the e+ and pbar flux, and that the
claims that the positron fraction measured by PAMELA requires new primary e+
sources are based on assumptions, that are not supported by observations. If
PAMELA results are correct, they suggest that f_{s,e+} is slightly increasing
with energy, which provides an interesting constraint on CR propagation models.
We argue that measurements of the e+ to pbar ratio are more useful for
challenging secondary production models than the positron fraction.

integrated Compton y-parameter, Y, and total projected mass of the clusters

self-similar scaling between M_GL and Y, with a scatter in mass at fixed Y of
32%. This scatter exceeds that predicted from numerical cluster simulations,

fixed T_X. We also find no evidence of segregation in Y between disturbed and
undisturbed clusters, as had been seen with T_X on the same physical scales. We
compare our scaling relation to the Bonamente et al. relation based on mass
measurements that assume hydrostatic equilibrium, finding no evidence for a
hydrostatic mass bias in cluster cores (M_GL = 0.98+/-0.13 M_HSE), consistent
with both predictions from numerical simulations and lensing/X-ray-based

if there are other boundaries present besides the DGP brane, such as in higher

demanding well-posedness of the action. Second, we calculate them directly from
the bulk, taking into account the Gibbons-Hawking-York terms in the bulk
Einstein-Hilbert action. As an application, we use the new boundary terms to
derive Israel junction conditions for Pi across a sheet-like source. In
addition, we calculate boundary terms and junction conditions for the galileons
which generalize the DGP Pi-lagrangian, showing that the boundary term for the
n-th order galileon is the (n-1)-th order galileon.

are coupled to the antiferromagnetism. By restricting our considerations to
distortions which preserve the translational symmetries of the lattice, we
present a general theory of the collective spin-Jahn-Teller effect in the
pyrochlore lattice. One of the predicted lattice distortions breaks the
inversion symmetry and gives rise to a chiral pyrochlore lattice, in which
frustrated bonds form helices with a definite handedness. The chirality is
transferred to the spin system through spin-orbit coupling, resulting in a

networks is a theoretical challenge, and is a topic of considerable recent
interest within the physics community. In this paper, according to the known
connections between MFPT, effective resistance, and the eigenvalues of graph
Laplacian, we first study analytically the MFPT between all node pairs of a
class of growing treelike networks, which we term deterministic uniform
recursive trees (DURTs), since one of its particular cases is a deterministic
version of the famous uniform recursive tree. The interesting quantity is
determined exactly through the recursive relation of the Laplacian spectra
obtained from the special construction of DURTs. The analytical result shows
that the MFPT between all couples of nodes in DURTs varies as $N \ln N$ for
large networks with node number $N$. Second, we study trapping on a particular
network of DURTs, focusing on a special case with the immobile trap positioned
at a node having largest degree. We determine exactly the average trapping time
(ATT) that is defined as the average of FPT from all nodes to the trap. In
contrast to the scaling of the MFPT, the leading behavior of ATT is a linear
function of $N$. Interestingly, we show that the behavior for ATT of the
trapping problem is related to the trapping location, which is in comparison
with the phenomenon of trapping on fractal T-graph although both networks
exhibit treestructure. Finally, we believe that the methods could open the way
to exactly calculate the MFPT and ATT in a wide range of deterministic media.

not dynamical and is completely expressed by means of the spin sources. Thus,

to introduce matter with spin. In principle, this can be done in several ways.

fundamental quantity of Nature, and how does clock time of metrology emerge in
the experimental description of dynamics. This work strongly supports the
fundamental timelessness of Nature. However, the correct view that physics is
described by relations between variables does not address the second problem of
how time does emerge at the macroscopic scale on the ground of a timeless
framework. In this work ordinary Hamiltonian dynamics is recast in a timeless
formalism capable to provide a definition of parameter time on the basis of the
only generalized coordinates, together with the Hamiltonian invariance on
trajectories, and a variational principle. Next, by relaxing the assumption of
periodicity of real clocks to the only cyclicity in the phase space, the second
problem is addressed. Physical systems, if complex enough, can be separated in
a subsystem whose dynamics is described, and another cyclic subsystem which
behaves as a clock. The dynamics of the first is mapped in the states of the
second cyclic subsystem which provides a discrete approximation of the
parameter time. Useful clocks fulfill a stability prescription which guarantees
that dynamics is expressed by simple laws also in terms of metric time as
naturally happens for parameter time. The two ideas provide a unitary framework
capable to account the fundamental timelessness of Nature, and the experimental
evidence of time evolution in macroscopic systems experienced by the observers.

becomes time or scale dependent, an extra term enters in the effective equation
of sate (EoS) of the vacuum energy $w^{eff}_{\Lambda}=-c^2-d\ln c^{2}/3d\ln a$.
This extra term can make the effective EoS of time variable CC cross the
cosmological boundary and be phantom-like at present. For the lack of a first
principle and fundamental physics theory to obtain the form $c^2$, we give a
simple parameterized form of $c^2$ as an example. Then the model is confronted
by the cosmic observations including SN Ia, BAO and CMB shift parameter $R$.

those of the existing Swendsen-Wang-Chayes-Machta (SWCM) algorithm, which
involves a full cluster decomposition of random-cluster configurations. We
explore the critical dynamics of this algorithm for several two-dimensional
Potts and random-cluster models. For integer $q$, the single-cluster algorithm
can be reduced to the Wolff algorithm, for which case we find that the
autocorrelation functions decay almost purely exponentially, with dynamic
exponents $z_{\rm exp} =0.07 (1), 0.521 (7)$, and $1.007 (9)$ for $q=2, 3$, and
4 respectively. For non-integer $q$, the dynamical behavior of the
single-cluster algorithm appears to be very dissimilar to that of the SWCM
algorithm. For large critical systems, the autocorrelation function displays a
range of power-law behavior as a function of time. The dynamic exponents are
relatively large. We provide an explanation for this peculiar dynamic behavior.

that several countries are very much influenced by these critical situations,

represent countries that are isolated from the main trade as soon as the

the following problem, for rationals x and y: given as input a planar graph G,
determine T(G;x,y). Vertigan completely mapped the complexity of exactly
computing the Tutte polynomial of a planar graph. He showed that the problem
can be solved in polynomial time if (x,y) is on the hyperbola H_q given by
(x-1)(y-1)=q for q=1 or q=2 or if (x,y) is one of the two special points
(x,y)=(-1,-1) or (x,y)=(1,1). Otherwise, the problem is #P-hard. In this paper,
we consider the problem of approximating T(G;x,y), in the usual sense of ""fully
polynomial randomised approximation scheme"" or FPRAS. Roughly speaking, an
FPRAS is required to produce, in polynomial time and with high probability, an
answer that has small relative error. Assuming that NP is different from RP, we
show that there is no FPRAS for the Tutte polynomial in a large portion of the
(x,y) plane. In particular, there is no FPRAS if x>1, y<-1 or if y>1, x<-1 or
if x<0, y<0 and q>5. Also, there is no FPRAS if x<1, y<1 and q=3. For q>5, our
result is intriguing because it shows that there is no FPRAS at
(x,y)=(1-q/(1+epsilon),-epsilon) for any positive epsilon but it leaves open
the limit point epsilon=0, which corresponds to approximately counting
q-colourings of a planar graph.

several measured binding and barrier energies, the system-level analysis
reveals insurmountable energy gaps between configurations, asymmetric ground
state caused by mechanically lifted configurational degeneracy, and forbidden

molecular ratchet-and-pawl device, which determinedly locks the dimer's

depends upon a few pathways, leading to the detachment of individual heads from
MT. Modifying rates for these detachment pathways changes the run length but
not the velocity of the dimer, consistent with mutant experiments. The run
length may increase with or without the ATP concentration, depending upon a
single rate for pure mechanical detachment. This finding provides an
explanation to a previous controversy concerning ATP dependence of the run
length, and related quantitative predictions of this study can be tested by a
future experiment. This study also finds that the experimental observations for
assisting loads can be quantitatively explained by load-biased head diffusion.
We thus conclude that the dimer motility under resisting as well as assisting

able to describe the coevolution of the structural dynamics and the underlying
electronic dynamics in a real-time manner. It is found that azobenzene
photoisomerization occurs predominantly by an out-of-plane rotation mechanism
even under a nontrivial resisting force of several tens of piconewtons. We have
repeated the simulations systematically for a broad range of parameters for
laser pulses, but could not find any photoisomerization event by a previously
suggested in-plane inversion mechanism. The simulations found that the
photoisomerization process can be held back by an external resisting force of
90 - 200 pN depending on the frequency and intensity of the lasers. This study
also found that a pure mechanical isomerization is possible from the cis state
if the azobenzene molecule is stretched by an external force of 1250 -1650 pN.

attracting considerable attention in wireless Ad Hoc networks. Node cooperation

to efficiently combine opportunistic scheduling and cooperative modes in the
Rayleigh fading scenarios. To do so, we first compare the throughput of SRP
(Spatial Reused Pattern) and AFP (Amplify Forwarding Pattern) in the
half-duplex case with the assumption that channel side information is known to
all and then come up with a new scheduling scheme. It will that that only
switching between SRP and AFP simply does little help to obtain an expected
improvement because SRP is always superior to AFP on average due to its
efficient spatial reuse. To improve the throughput further, we put forward a
new processing strategy in which buffers are employed at both relays in SRP
mode. By efficiently utilizing the links with relatively higher gains, the
throughput can be greatly improved at a cost of queuing delay. Furthermore, we
shall quantitatively evaluate the queuing delay and the tradeoff between the
throughput and the additional queuing delay. Finally, to realize our developed
strategy and make sure it always run at stable status, we present two criteria

question, even after nearly forty years of its discovery. The emission could
originate from either truly diffuse processes or from unresolved point sources.
Although the majority of the 271 point sources detected by EGRET (Energetic
Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope) are unidentified, of the identified sources,
blazars are the dominant candidates. Therefore, unresolved blazars may be
considered the main contributor to the EGRB, and many studies have been carried
out to understand their distribution, evolution and contribution to the EGRB.
Considering that gamma-ray emission comes mostly from jets of blazars and that
the jet emission decreases rapidly with increasing jet to line-of-sight angle,
it is not surprising that EGRET was not able to detect many large inclination
angle active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Though Fermi could only detect a few large
inclination angle AGNs in the first three months' survey, it is expected to
detect many such sources in the near future. Since non-blazar AGNs are expected
to have higher density as compared to blazars, these could also contribute
significantly to the EGRB. In this paper we discuss contributions from
unresolved discrete sources including normal galaxies, starburst galaxies,
blazars and off-axis AGNs to the EGRB.

outnumber the matter states. It's evolution is governed by a free energy which
admits phase transitions at two critical scale, separated by a triple

dimensions on an $S^{1}/Z_{2}$ orbifold, and derive the gravitational and

two key issues in such a setup: (i) the radion stability and radion mass; and
(ii) the localization of gravity, and the corresponding Kaluza-Klein (KK)
modes. We show explicitly that the radion is stable and its mass can be in the
order of $GeV$. In addition, the gravity is localized on the visible brane, and
its spectrum of the gravitational KK towers is discrete and can have a mass gap
of $TeV$, too. The high order Yukawa corrections to the 4-dimensional Newtonian
potential is exponentially suppressed, and can be negligible. Applying such a
setup to cosmology, we obtain explicitly the field equations in the bulk and
the generalized Friedmann equations on the branes.

Globular Clusters, the cluster NGC 1851 harbours a double subgiant branch, that
can be explained in terms of two stellar generations, only slightly differing
in age, the younger one having an increased total C+N+O abundance. Thanks to
this difference in the chemistry, a fit can be made to the subgiant branches,
roughly consistent with the C+N+O abundance variations already discovered two
decades ago, and confirmed by recent spectroscopic data. We compute theoretical
isochrones for the main sequence turnoff, by adopting four chemical mixtures
for the opacities and nuclear reaction rates. The standard mixture has
Z=10$^{-3}$ and [$\alpha$/Fe]=0.4, the others have C+N+O respectively equal to
2, 3 and 5 times the standard mixture, according to the element abundance
distribution described in the text. We compare tracks and isochrones, and show
how the results depend on the total CNO abundance. We notice that different
initial CNO abundances between two clusters, otherwise similar in metallicity
and age, may lead to differences in the turnoff morphology that can be easily
attributed to an age difference. We simulate the main sequence and subgiant
branch data for NGC 1851 and show that an increase of C+N+O by a factor $\sim$3
best reproduces the shift between the subgiant branches. We compare the main
sequence width in the color m$_{F336W}$-m$_{F814W}$ with models, and find that
the maximum helium abundance compatible with the data is Y$\simeq$0.29. We
consider the result in the framework of the formation of the second stellar
generation in globular clusters, for the bulk of which we estimate a helium
abundance of Y$\simlt 0.26$.

$c_s$ do solve the horizon problem. Among these, a phase transition in $c_s$ is
notable for leading to scale-invariant fluctuations if the initial conditions
are thermal. For contracting Universes all power-law $w(\ep_0)$ solve the
horizon problem, but only one leads to scale-invariance: $w\propto \ep_0^2$ and

change opinion. If the q neighbors agree, the voter takes their opinion; if
they do not have an unanimous opinion, still a voter can flip its state with
probability $\epsilon$. We solve the model on a fully connected network (i.e.
in mean-field) and compute the exit probability as well as the average time to
reach consensus. We analyze the results in the perspective of a recently
proposed Langevin equation aimed at describing generic phase transitions in

the q-voter model exhibits a disordered phase for high $\epsilon$ and an
ordered one for low $\epsilon$ with three possible ways to go from one to the
other: (i) a unique (generalized voter-like) transition, (ii) a series of two
consecutive Ising-like and directed percolation transition, and (iii) a series
of two transitions, including an intermediate regime in which the final state
depends on initial conditions. This third (so far unexplored) scenario, in
which a new type of ordering dynamics emerges, is rationalized and found to be
specific of mean-field, i.e. fluctuations are explicitly shown to wash it out
in spatially extended systems.

motivated by academic hiring. Suppose that a number of institutes are hiring
faculty members from a pool of applicants. Both institutes and applicants have
preferences over the other side. An institute classifies the applicants based
on their research areas (or any other criterion), and, for each class, it sets
a lower bound and an upper bound on the number of applicants it would hire in
that class. The objective is to find a stable matching from which no group of
participants has reason to deviate. Moreover, the matching should respect the
upper/lower bounds of the classes.
  In the first part of the paper, we study classified stable matching problems
whose classifications belong to a fixed set of ``order types.'' We show that if
the set consists entirely of downward forests, there is a polynomial-time
algorithm; otherwise, it is NP-complete to decide the existence of a stable
matching.
  In the second part, we investigate the problem using a polyhedral approach.
Suppose that all classifications are laminar families and there is no lower
bound. We propose a set of linear inequalities to describe stable matching
polytope and prove that it is integral. This integrality allows us to find
various optimal stable matchings using Ellipsoid algorithm. A further
ramification of our result is the description of the stable matching polytope
for the many-to-many (unclassified) stable matching problem. This answers an
open question posed by Sethuraman, Teo and Qian.

emission than more luminous galaxies with similar specific star-formation
rates. Unlike more luminous galaxies, we find that the very faint dwarf
galaxies show no significant dependence at all of PAH emission on
star-formation rate, metallicity, or radiation hardness, despite the fact that
the sample spans a significant range in all of these quantities. When the very
faint dwarfs in our sample are compared with more luminous (M_r ~ -18 mag)
dwarfs, we find that PAH emission depends on metallicity and radiation

called entangled states. A physical system, that is in an entangled state
displays an intricate correlation between its subsystems. There are also some
composite quantum states (classically correlated states or separable states)
that are not entangled. It is generally claimed, often without a rigorous proof
to support, that these intricate correlations of an entangled state cannot
occur in a classical system. This expository article, provides an elementary
proof that entangled states cannot arise in the setting of classical mechanics.
In addition, a detailed description of the origin of entanglement in quantum
systems is included. The mathematical concepts that are necessary for this
purpose are presented. The absence of entanglement in the classical setting is
due to the fact that every pure classical state of a composite system is a
product state, that is, a tensor product of two pure states of the subsystems.
In contrast, there are pure composite quantum states that cannot be expressed
in the form of a product state or even by a convex sum of product states.
Roughly speaking, this is because classical states are positive valued
functions on the phase-space while quantum states are positive linear
operators. The structure of the tensor product between two commutative spaces
of scalar valued functions is drastically different from that of the tensor
product between two non-commutative spaces of linear operators. In other words,
entanglement is a non-commutative phenomenon.

dopant ions in undoped and lightly-doped cuprates, is studied. We demonstrate
that charged surface defects in an insulator lead to a Gaussian broadening of
the Angle-Resolved Photoemisson Spectroscopy (ARPES) lines. The effect is due
to the long-range nature of the Coulomb interaction. A tiny surface
concentration of defects about a fraction of one per cent is sufficient to
explain the line broadening observed in Sr$_2$CuO$_2$Cl$_2$, La$_2$CuO$_{4}$,
and Ca$_{2}$CuO$_{2}$Cl$_{2}$. Due to the Coulomb screening, the ARPES spectra
evolve dramatically with doping, changing their shape from a broad Gaussian
form to narrow Lorentzian ones. To understand the screening mechanism and the
lineshape evolution in detail, we perform Hartree-Fock simulations with random
positions of surface defects and dopant ions. To check validity of the model we
calculate the Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance (NQR) lineshapes as a function of
doping and reproduce the experimentally observed NQR spectra. Our study also
indicates opening of a substantial Coulomb gap at the chemical potential. For a
surface CuO$_2$ layer the value of the gap is of the order of 10 meV while in
the bulk it is reduced to the value about a few meV.

Higgs contribution to different observables, we find that $b\to s\gamma$
transitions and $\Delta M_{B_d}$ restrict the coupling $\lambda_{tt}$ of the
top quark (corresponding to $\cot\beta$ in models with a $Z_2$ symmetry) to
$|\lambda_{tt}|<1$ for $m_{H^+}\lesssim 500$ GeV. Stringent constraints from
$B$ meson decays are obtained also on the other third generation couplings
$\lambda_{bb}$ and $\lambda_{\tau\tau}$, but with stronger dependence on
$m_{H^+}$. For the second generation, we obtain constraints on combinations of
$\lambda_{ss}$, $\lambda_{cc}$, and $\lambda_{\mu\mu}$ from leptonic $K$ and
$D_s$ decays. The limits on the general couplings are translated to the common
2HDM types I -- IV with a $Z_2$ symmetry, and presented on the
$(m_{H^+},\tan\beta)$ plane. The flavor constraints are most excluding in the
type II model which lacks a decoupling limit in $\tan\beta$. We obtain a lower
limit $m_{H^+}\gtrsim 300$ GeV in models of type II and III, while no lower
bound on $m_{H^+}$ is found for types I and IV.

effect asserts that often the sub-ensemble of particles going through the
tunnel seems to cross the tunnel region instantaneously. An obstacle to the
utilization of this effect for getting faster signals is the exponential
damping by the tunnel, so there seems to be a trade-off between speedup and
intensity. In this paper we prove that this trade-off is never in favor of
faster signals: the probability for a signal to reach its destination before
some deadline is always reduced by the tunnel, for arbitrary incoming states,
arbitrary positive and compactly supported tunnel potentials, and arbitrary
detectors. More specifically, we show this for several different ways to define
``the same incoming state'' and ''the same detector'' when comparing the
settings with and without tunnel potential. The arrival time measurements are
expressed in the time-covariant approach, but we also allow the detection to be
a localization measurement at a later time.

line. Most of the existing papers devoted to minimax properties assume that the
support of the underlying density is bounded and known. But this assumption may
be very difficult to handle in practice. In this work, we show that, exactly as
a curse of dimensionality exists when the data lie in $\R^d$, there exists a
curse of support as well when the support of the density is infinite. As for
the dimensionality problem where the rates of convergence deteriorate when the
dimension grows, the minimax rates of convergence may deteriorate as well when
the support becomes infinite. This problem is not purely theoretical since the
simulations show that the support-dependent methods are really affected in
practice by the size of the density support, or by the weight of the density
tail. We propose a method based on a biorthogonal wavelet thresholding rule
that is adaptive with respect to the nature of the support and the regularity
of the signal, but that is also robust in practice to this curse of support.
The threshold, that is proposed here, is very accurately calibrated so that the
gap between optimal theoretical and practical tuning parameters is almost
filled.

place and are considered very accurate after adjustment in their values to
correctly predict the signs of the heats of formation of more than 500 metallic
binary systems. In this paper, we argue that Phi is proportional to the
electronegativity (Chi) of metallic elements and that N^(1/3) is the valence
effective on a linear bond. We show that, with the above hypothesis, Chi can be
derived in the absolute sense, following Gordy, as the electrostatic potential
due to the effective charge of the nucleus of an atom in a metal, felt at the
mid-point of a bond to the nearest atom. The exponent 1/3 has its origin in the
high ligancy and resonance in metals. An excellent agreement with the
hypothesis is observed for the hypoelectronic elements, while the buffer and
hyperelectronic elements show interesting variations. It is argued that the
unlike atom pair bond energies, which are correlated to the distribution of
binary systems on the map constructed using the magnitudes of parameters del
Phi and del N of Miedema, originate from the scatter in the distribution of
elements in the electronegativity versus N^(1/3)/R graph. Since it is the
scatter that is important, we see that the small corrections effected by
Miedema et al. to the parameters Phi and N are significant in deciding the
energies involved. An interpretation is provided for the energy effects
involved in the alloying of metals.

the kinematics of the jet knots, which depends on the correct identification of
the components to determine their respective proper motions and position angles
on the plane of the sky. Identification problems related to fitting procedures,
as well as observations poorly sampled in time, may influence the follow up of
the components in time, which consequently might contribute to a
misinterpretation of the data. In order to deal with these limitations, we
introduce a very powerful statistical tool to analyse jet precession: the
cross-entropy method for continuous multi-extremal optimisation. Only based on
the raw data of the jet components (right ascension and declination offsets
from the core), the cross-entropy method searches for the precession model
parameters that better represent the data. In this work we present a large
number of tests to validate this technique, using synthetic precessing jets
built from a given set of precession parameters. Aiming to recover these
parameters, we applied the cross-entropy method to our precession model,
varying exhaustively the quantities associated to the method. Our results have
shown that even in the most challenging tests, the cross-entropy method was
able to find the correct parameters within 1%-level. Even for a non-precessing

precession.

linear Rashba spin-orbit coupling is obtained. For quantum wires with
spin-conserving boundary conditions, we find a crossover from weak anti- to
weak localization as the wire width W is reduced using exact diagonalization of
the Cooperon equation. This crossover is due to the dimensional dependence of
the spin relaxation rate of conduction electrons, which becomes diminished,
when the wire width is smaller than the bulk spin precession length $L_{SO}$.
We thus confirm previous results for small wire width, $W/L_{SO}<= 1$
[PRL98,176808(2007)], where only the transverse 0-modes of the Cooperon
equation had been taken into account. We find that spin helix solutions become
stable for arbitrary ratios of linear Rashba and Dresselhaus coupling in narrow
wires. For wider wires, the spin relaxation rate is found to be not monotonous
as function of wire width: it becomes first enhanced for W on the order of the
bulk $L_{SO}$ before it becomes diminished for smaller wire widths. In
addition, we find that the spin relaxation is smallest at the edge of the wire
for wide wires. The effect of the Zeeman coupling to the magnetic field
perpendicular to the 2D electron system is studied and found that it shifts the
crossover from weak anti- to weak localization to larger wire widths $W_c$.
When the transverse confinement potential of the quantum wire is smooth
(adiabatic), the spin relaxation rate is found to be enhanced as W is reduced.
We find that only a spin polarized state retains a finite spin relaxation rate
in such narrow wires. Thus, we conclude that the injection of polarized spins
into nonmagnetic quantum wires should be favorable in wires with smooth
confinement potential. Finally, in wires with tubular shape, corresponding to
transverse periodic boundary conditions, we find no reduction of the spin
relaxation rate.

should be contextual to their quick migration towards the central star due to
the protoplanets-disc interactions on a timescale of the order of $10^5$ years,
for objects of nearly 10 terrestrial masses. Such a timescale should be smaller
by an order of magnitude than that of gas accretion onto the protoplanet during
the hierarchical growing-up of protoplanets by collisions with other minor
objects. These arguments have recently been analysed using N-body and/or
fluid-dynamics codes or a mixing of them. In this work, inviscid 2D simulations
are performed, using the SPH method, to study the migration of one protoplanet,
to evaluate the effectiveness of the accretion disc in the protoplanet dragging
towards the central star, as a function of the mass of the planet itself, of
disc tangential kinematics. To this purpose, the SPH scheme is considered
suitable to study the roles of turbulence, kinematic and boundary conditions,
due to its intrinsic advective turbulence, especially in 2D and in 3D codes.
Simulations are performed both in disc sub-Keplerian and in Keplerian kinematic
conditions as a parameter study of protoplanetary migration if moderate and
consistent deviations from Keplerian Kinematics occur. Our results show
migration times of a few orbital periods for Earth-like planets in
sub-Keplerian conditions, while for Jupiter-like planets estimates give that
about $10^4$ orbital periods are needed to half the orbital size. Timescales of
planet migration are strongly dependent on the relative position of the planet
with respect to the shock region near the centrifugal barrier of the disc flow.

subsequent, strictly tensorial, theory of elasticity. The consideration of
arbitrary coordinate systems for the representation of both, the points in the
laboratory, and the material points (comoving coordinates), allows to develop a
simple, old fashioned theory, where only measurable quantities -like the Cauchy
stress- need be introduced. The theory accounts for the possibility of
asymmetric stress (Cosserat elastic media), but, contrary to usual developments
of the theory, the basic variable is not a micro-rotation, but the more
fundamental micro-rotation velocity. The deformation tensor here introduced is
the proper tensorial equivalent of the poorly defined deformation ""tensors"" of
the usual theory. It is related to the deformation velocity tensor via the
matricant. The strain is the logarithm of the deformation tensor. As the theory
accounts for general Cosserat media, the strain is not necessarily symmetric.
Hooke's law can be properly introduced in the material coordinates (as the
stiffness is a function of the material point). A particularity of the theory
is that the components of the stiffness tensor in the material (comoving)
coordinates are not time-dependent. The configuration space is identified to
the part of the Lie group GL(3)+, that is geodesically connected to the origin

analysed. The model consists of a single massive Abelian vector field, with a
Maxwell type kinetic term. By assuming that the kinetic function and the mass
of the vector field are appropriately varying during inflation, it is shown
that a scale invariant spectrum of superhorizon perturbations can be generated.
These perturbations can contribute to the curvature perturbation of the
Universe. If the vector field remains light at the end of inflation it is found
that it can generate substantial statistical anisotropy in the spectrum and
bispectrum of the curvature perturbation. In this case the non-Gaussianity in
the curvature perturbation is predominantly anisotropic, which will be a
testable prediction in the near future. If, on the other hand, the vector field
is heavy at the end of inflation then it is demonstrated that particle
production is approximately isotropic and the vector field alone can give rise
to the curvature perturbation, without directly involving any fundamental
scalar field. The parameter space for both possibilities is shown to be
substantial. Finally, toy-models are presented which show that the desired
variation of the mass and kinetic function of the vector field can be

diameter. Structures on the stellar photosphere have been detected in the
visible and near-infrared as well as a compact molecular environment called the
MOLsphere. Mid-infrared observations have revealed the nature of some of the
molecules in the MOLsphere, some being the precursor of dust. Aims: Betelgeuse
is an excellent candidate to understand the process of mass loss in red
supergiants. Using diffraction-limited adaptive optics (AO) in the
near-infrared, we probe the photosphere and close environment of Betelgeuse to
study the wavelength dependence of its extension, and to search for
asymmetries. Methods: We obtained AO images with the VLT/NACO instrument,
taking advantage of the ""cube"" mode of the CONICA camera to record separately a
large number of short-exposure frames. This allowed us to adopt a ""lucky
imaging"" approach for the data reduction, and obtain diffraction-limited images
over the spectral range 1.04-2.17 $\mu$m in 10 narrow-band filters. Results: In
all filters, the photosphere of Betelgeuse appears partly resolved. We identify
an asymmetric envelope around the star, with in particular a relatively bright
""plume"" extending in the southwestern quadrant up to a radius of approximately
six times the photosphere. The CN molecule provides an excellent match to the
1.09 mic bandhead in absorption in front of the stellar photosphere, but the
emission spectrum of the plume is more difficult to interpret. Conclusions: Our
AO images show that the envelope surrounding Betelgeuse has a complex and
irregular structure. We propose that the southwestern plume is linked either to
the presence of a convective hot spot on the photosphere, or to the rotation of
the star.

Quantifying the purity of an experimentally achieved graph state could in

infeasible even for a moderate number of qubits.
  In this paper we present a method to estimate the purity of experimentally
achieved graph states with simple measurements. The observables we consider are
the stabilizers of the underlying graph. Then, we formulate the problem as:
""What is the state with the least purity that is compatible with the
measurement data?"" We solve this problem analytically and compare the obtained

develop a set of analysis tools and a novel experimental setup that probes the
mechanical response of fibrous networks in a geometry that mimics a typical
deformation profile imposed by cells in vivo. We observe strong fiber alignment
and densification as a function of applied strain for both uncrosslinked and
crosslinked collagenous networks. This alignment is found to be irreversibly
imprinted in uncrosslinked collagen networks, suggesting a simple mechanism for
tissue organization at the microscale. However, crosslinked networks display
similar fiber alignment and the same geometrical properties as uncrosslinked
gels, but with full reversibility. Plasticity is therefore not required to
align fibers. On the contrary, our data show that this effect is part of the
fundamental non-linear properties of fibrous biological networks.

from the 3d incompatible elasticity theory, conjectured to explain the

  Recall that a smooth Riemannian metric on a simply connected domain can be
realized as the pull-back metric of an orientation preserving deformation if
and only if the associated Riemann curvature tensor vanishes identically. When
this condition fails, one seeks a deformation yielding the closest metric
realization. We set up a variational formulation of this problem by introducing
the non-Euclidean version of the nonlinear elasticity functional, and establish
its $\Gamma$-convergence under the proper scaling. As a corollary, we obtain
