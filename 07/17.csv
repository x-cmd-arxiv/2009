is limited by uncertainty in relating observable signals to cluster mass. We
demonstrate that a small mass-calibration follow-up program can significantly
reduce this uncertainty and improve parameter constraints, particularly when
the follow-up targets are judiciously chosen. To this end, we apply a simulated
annealing algorithm to maximize the dark energy information at fixed
observational cost, and find that optimal follow-up strategies can reduce the
observational cost required to achieve a specified precision by up to an order
of magnitude. Considering clusters selected from optical imaging in the Dark
Energy Survey, we find that approximately 200 low-redshift X-ray clusters or
massive Sunyaev-Zel'dovich clusters can improve the dark energy figure of merit
by 50%, provided that the follow-up mass measurements involve no systematic
error. In practice, the actual improvement depends on (1) the uncertainty in
the systematic error in follow-up mass measurements, which needs to be
controlled at the 5% level to avoid severe degradation of the results; and (2)
the scatter in the optical richness-mass distribution, which needs to be made
as tight as possible to improve the efficacy of follow-up observations.

relevance of this simple model for the water uptake in tall trees. Under
moderate concentrations of a solute, the solution and solvent are under the
positive and negative pressure, respectively. In the case of the soft membrane
the pressure difference between the compartments with the solvent and solution
is given by van't Hoff equation. A state of the negative pressure is not stable
and after some time cavitations transform the solvent into the state of
coexisting liquid and bubbles of saturated vapor. The pressure difference
between the solvent and solution decreases and the membrane relaxes restoring
the liquid phase in the compartment with solvent. In this way the solvent
oscillates between the tensile state and the coexisting state of liquid and
bubbles of saturated vapor. The xylem and phloem, the main vascular systems in
trees, are coupled with ray cells. Assuming that a sap in these systems is kept
under the constant volume the osmosis between the xylem and phloem with ray
cells sustains the negative pressure of the xylem sap. Due to the osmosis
elastic energy stored in walls of tracheary element could repair cavitations.

the topology of spacetime there are typically finitely many topological degrees
of freedom as well as topological interactions of Aharonov-Bohm type between
massive objects. In order to capture these topological aspects we consider a
two-fold central extension of the Galilei group whose Lie algebra possesses an
invariant and non-degenerate inner product. Using this inner product we define
Galilean gravity as a Chern-Simons theory of the doubly-extended Galilei group.
The particular extension of the Galilei group we consider is the classical
double of a much studied group, the extended homogeneous Galilei group, which
is also often called Nappi-Witten group. We exhibit the Poisson-Lie structure
of the doubly extended Galilei group, and quantise the Chern-Simons theory
using a Hamiltonian approach. Many aspects of the quantum theory are determined
by the quantum double of the extended homogenous Galilei group, or Galilei
double for short. We study the representation theory of the Galilei double,
explain how associated braid group representations account for the topological
interactions in the theory, and briefly comment on an associated

compact connected symplectic toric manifolds. In this paper we extend Delzant's
classification to non-compact symplectic toric manifolds. For a non-compact
symplectic toric manifold the image of the moment map need not be convex and
the induced map on the quotient need not be an embedding. Moreover, even when
the map on the quotient is an embedding, its image no longer determines the
symplectic toric manifold; a degree two characteristic class on the quotient
makes an appearance. Nevertheless, the quotient is a manifold with corners, and
the induced map from the quotient to the dual of the Lie algebra is what we
call a unimodular local embedding. We classify non-compact symplectic toric
manifolds in terms of manifolds with corners equipped with degree two
cohomology classes and unimodular local embeddings into the dual of the Lie
algebra of the corresponding torus. The main new ingredient is the construction
of a symplectic toric manifold from such data. The proof passes through an
equivalence of categories between symplectic toric manifolds and symplectic
toric bundles over a fixed unimodular local embedding. This equivalence also
gives a geometric interpretation of the degree two cohomology class.

power-controlled decentralized wireless networks, in which the
quality-of-service (QoS) is expressed in terms of the signal-to-interference
ratio (SIR). We analyze a previously proposed admission control algorithm,
which was designed to maintain the SIR of operational (active) links above some
given threshold at all times (protection of active links). This protection
property ensures that as new users attempt to join the network, the already
established links sustain their quality. The considered scheme may be thus
applicable in some cognitive radio networks, where the fundamental premise is
that secondary users may be granted channel access only if it does not cause
disturbance to primary users.
  The admission control algorithm was previously analyzed under the assumption
of affine interference functions. This paper extends all the previous results
to arbitrary standard interference functions, which capture many important
receiver designs, including optimal linear reception in the sense of maximizing
the SIR and the worst-case receiver design. Furthermore, we provide novel
conditions for protection of active users under the considered control scheme
when individual power constraints are imposed on each link. Finally, we
consider the possibility of a joint optimization of transmitters and receivers
in networks with linear transceivers, which includes linear beamforming in
multiple antenna systems. Transmitter optimization is performed alternately
with receiver optimization to generate non-decreasing sequences of SIRs.
Numerical evaluations show that additional transmitter side optimization has

measurements of CMB anisotropies, galaxy clustering, and weak gravitational
lensing alike have to rely upon an accurate theoretical background concerning
the bispectrum and its noise properties. If only small portions of the sky are
considered, it is often desirable to perform the analysis in the flat-sky
limit. We aim at a formal, detailed derivation of the bispectrum covariance in
the flat-sky approximation, focusing on a pure two-dimensional Fourier-plane
approach. We define an unbiased estimator of the bispectrum, which takes the
average over the overlap of annuli in Fourier space, and compute its full
covariance. The outcome of our formalism is compared to the flat-sky spherical
harmonic approximation in terms of the covariance, the behavior under parity
transformations, and the information content. We introduce a geometrical
interpretation of the averaging process in the estimator, thus providing an
intuitive understanding. Contrary to foregoing work, we find a difference by a
factor of two between the covariances of the Fourier-plane and the spherical
harmonic approach. We argue that this discrepancy can be explained by the
differing behavior with respect to parity. However, in an exemplary analysis it
is demonstrated that the Fisher information of both formalisms agrees to high
accuracy. Via the geometrical interpretation we are able to link the
normalization in the bispectrum estimator to the area enclosed by the triangle
configuration at consideration as well as to the Wigner symbol, which leads to
convenient approximation formulae for the covariances of both approaches.

(ISM) and molecular clouds is the power-law energy spectrum for velocity
fluctuations, E(k) \propto k^{\alpha}. The Kolmogorov scaling exponent,
\alpha=-5/3, is typical. At the same time, the observed probability
distribution function (PDF) of gas densities in both the ISM as well as in
molecular clouds is a log-normal distribution, which is similar to the initial
mass function (IMF) that describes the distribution of stellar masses. We
examine the density and velocity structure of interstellar gas traversed by
curved shock waves in the kinematic limit. We demonstrate mathematically that
just a few passages of curved shock waves generically produces a log-normal
density PDF. This explains the ubiquity of the log-normal PDF in many different
numerical simulations. We also show that subsequent interaction with a
spherical blast wave generates a power-law density distribution at high
densities, qualitatively similar to the Salpeter power-law for the IMF.
Finally, we show that a focused shock produces a downstream flow with energy
spectrum exponent \alpha=-2. Subsequent shock passages reduce this slope,
achieving \alpha \approx -5/3 after a few passages. Subsequent dissipation of
energy piled up at the small scales will act to maintain the spectrum very near
to the Kolomogorov value. Therefore, fully-developed turbulence may not be
required to explain the observed energy spectrum and density PDF. We argue that
the self-similar spherical blast wave arising from expanding HII regions or
stellar winds from massive stars may ultimately be responsible for creating the
high mass, power-law, tail in the IMF.

topics are covered. The first is chaotic flux dynamics and its prediction via
Melnikov integrals. It turns out that DC current bias cannot induce chaotic
flux dynamics, while AC current bias can. The existence of a common root to the
Melnikov integrals is a necessary condition for the existence of chaotic flux
dynamics. The second topic is on the components of the global attractor and the
bifurcation in the perturbation parameter measuring the strength of loss, bias
and irregularity of the junction. The global attractor can contain co-existing
local attractors e.g. a local chaotic attractor and a local regular attractor.
In the infinite dimensional phase space setting, the bifurcation is very
complicated. Chaotic attractors can appear and disappear in a random fashion.
Three types of attractors (chaos, breather, spatially uniform and temporally
periodic attractor) are identified. The third topic is ratchet effect. Ratchet
effect can be achieved by a current bias field which corresponds to an
asymmetric potential, in which case the flux dynamics is ever lasting chaotic.
When the current bias field corresponds to a symmetric potential, the flux
dynamics is often transiently chaotic, in which case the ratchet effect
disappears after sufficiently long time.

spin, that are consistent with those obtained in the thermal dominant state.
Specifically, we analyze many RXTE spectra of two black hole transients,

edge of the accretion disk remains constant to within a few percent as the

as the fraction of the thermal seed photons that are scattered approaches 25%.
We conclude that the continuum-fitting method can be applied to a much wider

neutrinos masses via the high-precision measurements of galaxy power spectrum,
when combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) information. In this paper
we develop a method to model galaxy power spectrum in the weakly nonlinear
regime for a mixed dark matter (CDM plus finite-mass neutrinos) model, based on
perturbation theory (PT) whose validity is well tested by simulations for a CDM
model. In doing this we carefully study various aspects of the nonlinear
clustering and then arrive at a useful approximation allowing for a quick
computation of the nonlinear power spectrum as in the CDM case. The nonlinear
galaxy bias is also included in a self-consistent manner within the PT
framework. Thus the use of our PT model can give a more robust understanding of
the measured galaxy power spectrum as well as allow for higher sensitivity to
neutrino masses due to the gain of Fourier modes beyond the linear regime.
Based on the Fisher matrix formalism, we find that BOSS or Stage-III type
survey, when combined with Planck CMB information, gives a precision of total
neutrino mass constraint, sigma(m_nu,tot) 0.1eV, while Stage-IV type survey may
achieve sigma(m_nu,tot) 0.05eV, i.e. more than a 1-sigma detection of neutrino
masses. We also discuss possible systematic errors on dark energy parameters
caused by the neutrino mass uncertainty. The significant correlation between
neutrino mass and dark energy parameters is found, if the information on power
spectrum amplitude is included. More importantly, for Stage-IV type survey, a
best-fit dark energy model may be biased and falsely away from the underlying
true model by more than the 1-sigma statistical errors, if neutrino mass is
ignored in the model fitting.

formation of galaxies starting from the detailed study of the quasar
HE0450-2958 and extending the discussion to a series of converging evidence
that radio jets may trigger galaxy formation. The direct detection with VISIR
at the ESO-VLT of the 7 kpc distant companion galaxy of HE0450-2958 allows us
to spatially separate the sites of quasar and star formation activity in this
composite system made of two ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). No host
galaxy has yet been detected for this quasar, but the companion galaxy stellar
mass would bring HE0450-2958 in the local M(BH)-M(stellar bulge) relation if it
were to merge with the QSO. This is bound to happen because of their close
distance (7 kpc) and small relative velocity (~60-200 km/s). We conclude that
we may be witnessing the building of the M(BH)-M(stellar bulge) relation, or at
least of a major event in that process. The star formation rate (~340 Msun/yr),
age (40-200 Myr) and stellar mass ([5-6]x10^10 Msun) are consistent with
jet-induced formation of the companion galaxy. We suggest that HE0450-2958 may
be fueled in fresh material by cold gas accretion from intergalactic filaments.
We map the projected galaxy density surrounding the QSO as a potential tracer
of intergalactic filaments and discuss a putative detection. Comparison to
other systems suggests that inside-out formation of quasar host galaxies and
jet-induced galaxy formation may be a common process. Two tests are proposed
for this new paradigm: (1) the detection of offset molecular gas or dust
emission with respect to the position of distant QSOs, (2) the delayed
formation of host galaxies as a result of QSO activity, hence the two step
building of the M(BH)/M(stellar bulge) ratio.

estimate that a further ~26% of these stars may be blends with fainter
variables, though most of these blends are likely to be among the hotter stars

eclipsing binaries, have previously been identified as variables or are blended
with previously identified variables. One of the newly identified eclipsing
binaries is 1RXS J154727.5+450803, a known P = 3.55 day, late M-dwarf SB2

The radii of the component stars are larger than theoretical expectations if

spotted BY Dra-type stars for which we determine rotation periods. Using this

results obtained using a simpler analysis. These results appear to be robust to
uncertainties in the quasar (QSO) continuum placement. We further discuss
constraints obtained by a combined analysis of the high-resolution flux PDF and
the power spectrum measured from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) lya forest

temperature-density relation, but prefers somewhat higher values (sigma_8 ~

observable with current and next generation optical/IR telescopes, provided
that the atmosphere of the forming planet permits astronomers to observe
brightness temperatures approaching that of the molten surface. Detectability
of a collisional afterglow depends on properties of the planet's atmosphere --
primarily on the mass of the atmosphere. A planet with a thin atmosphere is
more readily detected, because there is little atmosphere to obscure the hot
surface. Paradoxically, a more massive atmosphere prevents one from easily
seeing the hot surface, but also keeps the planet hot for a longer time. In
terms of planetary mass, more massive planets are also easier to detect than
smaller ones because of their larger emitting surface areas. We present
preliminary calculations assuming a range of protoplanet masses (1-10
$M_\earth$), surface pressures (1-1000 bar), and atmospheric compositions, for
molten planets with surface temperatures ranging from 1000 to 1800 K, in order
to explore the diversity of emergent spectra that are detectable. While current
8- to 10-m class ground-based telescopes may detect hot protoplanets at wide
orbital separations beyond 30 AU (if they exist), we will likely have to wait
for next-generation extremely large telescopes or improved diffraction
suppression techniques to find terrestrial planets in formation within several
AU of their host stars.

One common problem is to track users with the largest deviation from the norm

one hand, stream outliers are easily tracked for simple measures, such as max

Similarly to classical simple homotopy theory, the strong homotopy types can be
described by elementary moves. An elementary move in this setting is called a
strong collapse and it is a particular kind of simplicial collapse. The
advantage of using strong collapses is the existence and uniqueness of cores
and their relationship with the nerves of the complexes. From this theory we
derive new results for studying simplicial collapsibility with a different
point of view. We analyze vertex-transitive simplicial $G$-actions and prove a
particular case of the Evasiveness conjecture for simplicial complexes.
Moreover, we reduce the general conjecture to the class of minimal complexes.

collapsible complexes. We obtain this and other results on collapsibility of

Periods (LSPs). We use radial velocities obtained from VLT spectral

and to evaluate models for the cause of LSPs. This sample is much larger than
the combined previous studies of Hinkle et al. (2002) and Wood, Olivier &
Kawaler (2004). Binary and pulsation models have enjoyed much support in recent
years. Assuming stellar pulsation, we calculate from the velocity curves that
the typical fractional radius change over an LSP cycle is greater than 30 per
cent. This should lead to large changes in Teff that are not observed. Also,
the small light amplitude of these stars seems inconsistent with the radius
amplitude. We conclude that pulsation is not a likely explanation for the LSPs.
The main alternative, physical movement of the star -- binary motion -- also
has severe problems. If the velocity variations are due to binary motion, the
distribution of the angle of periastron in our large sample of stars has a
probability of 1.4e-3 that it comes from randomly aligned binary orbits. In
addition, we calculate a typical companion mass of 0.09 Msun. Less than 1 per
cent of low mass main sequence stars have companions near this mass (0.06 to
0.12 Msun) whereas ~25 to 50 per cent of low mass red giants end up with LSPs.
We are unable to find a suitable model for the LSPs and conclude by listing
their known properties.

the formula obtained from the anti-de-Sitter space/conformal field theory
(AdS/CFT) correspondence. In this setup, we calculate the nuclear modification
factor $R_{\rm{AA}}$ for the single-electrons from the charm and bottom quarks
to extract the magnitude of the drag force from the PHENIX and STAR data. The
$R_{\rm{AA}}$ for single-electrons with $p_{T}\geq 3$ GeV indicates that the
drag force is close to the AdS/CFT prediction. Effects of the drag force on the
elliptic flow of single-electrons are also discussed. Moreover, we predict the
electron-muon correlation which is closely related to the heavy-quark pair
correlation in hot matter.

many-body states of a lattice system and are the basis of a wealth of numerical
simulation algorithms. We discuss how to incorporate a global symmetry, given
by a compact, completely reducible group G, in tensor network decompositions
and algorithms. This is achieved by considering tensors that are invariant
under the action of the group G. Each symmetric tensor decomposes into two
types of tensors: degeneracy tensors, containing all the degrees of freedom,
and structural tensors, which only depend on the symmetry group. In numerical
calculations, the use of symmetric tensors ensures the preservation of the
symmetry, allows selection of a specific symmetry sector, and significantly
reduces computational costs. On the other hand, the resulting tensor network
can be interpreted as a superposition of exponentially many spin networks. Spin
networks are used extensively in loop quantum gravity, where they represent
states of quantum geometry. Our work highlights their importance also in the
context of tensor network algorithms, thus setting the stage for
cross-fertilization between these two areas of research.

rising phase of the cycle the number of SAP events were roughly equal on the
north and south hemispheres. However, activity on the southern hemisphere has
been dominant since 1999. Our statistical study shows that the N-S asymmetry is
more significant then the E-W asymmetry.

M atom dopings to the superconducting LnFeAsO1-xFx (Ln1111) system. The NMR
longitudinal relaxation rates 1/T1 have also been measured for samples of
LaFe1-yCoyAsO1-xFx with various x values. Co atoms doped to the superconducting
LnFeAsO1-xFx are nonmagnetic, and the Tc-suppression by the Co atoms has been
found to be too weak to understand by the pair breaking effect expected for the
S+- superconducting symmetry proposed as the most probable one for the system.
It throws a serious doubt whether the symmetry is realized in this system.
Instead of the pair breaking, two mechanisms of the Tc-suppression by the doped
impurities have been found: One is the electron localization, which appears
when the sheet resistance exceeds h/4e2=6.45 kohm, and another is the
disappearance or reduction of the hole-Fermi-surfaces around the gamma point in
the reciprocal space. The latter mechanism has been observed, when the electron
number increases with increasing Co-doping level and the system changes from an
anomalous metal to an ordinary one. On the two distinct T dependences of 1/T1
of LaFeAsO1-xFx, 1/T1 T6 reported by our group in the T region from Tc to ~0.4
Tc for samples with the highest Tc values with varying x, and 1/T1 T2.5-3.0
observed by many groups in the almost entire T region studied below Tc, we
discuss what the origin of the difference is, and show that, at least, the
T2.5-3.0-like dependence of 1/T1 cannot be considered as the experimental
evidence for the S+- symmetry of the order parameter.

  In this article we establish that when $2m=6$ every saddle-shaped solution is
unstable outside of every compact set and, as a consequence has infinite Morse

at infinity. Moreover we prove the existence of a minimal and a maximal
saddle-shaped solutions and derive monotonicity properties for the maximal

  These results are relevant in connection with a conjecture of De Giorgi on 1D

Maxwell equations and their solutions can then be separated readily into
longitudinal and transverse components relative to the direction of the wave

potentials and their gauge transformations in vacuum and in materials can also
be discussed from an elementary perspective. In particular, the excessive
freedom of choice associated with the gauge dependence of the scalar and the
longitudinal vector potentials stands out with clarity in Fourier spaces. Since
these potentials are introduced to represent the instantaneous longitudinal
electric field, the actual cancellation in the latter of causal contributions
arising from these potentials separately in most velocity gauges becomes an
important issue. This cancellation is explicitly demonstrated both in the
Fourier space, and for pedagogical reasons again in space-time. The physical
origin of the gauge degree of freedom in the masslessness of the photon, the

craters on the lunar surface. The asymmetry is related to the synchronous
rotation of the Moon: there is a higher density of rayed craters on the leading
hemisphere compared with the trailing hemisphere. Rayed craters represent
generally the youngest impacts. The purpose of this paper is to test the
hypotheses that (i) the population of Near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) is the source
of the impactors that have made the rayed craters, and (ii) that impacts by
this projectile population account quantitatively for the observed asymmetry.
We carried out numerical simulations of the orbital evolution of a large number
of test particles representing NEAs in order to determine directly their impact
flux on the Moon. The simulations were done in two stages. In the first stage
we obtained encounter statistics of NEAs on the Earth's activity sphere. In the
second stage we calculated the direct impact flux of the encountering particles
on the surface of the Moon; the latter calculations were confined within the
activity sphere of the Earth. A steady-state synthetic population of NEAs was
generated from a debiased orbital distribution of the known NEAs. We find that
the near-Earth asteroids do have an asymmetry in their impact flux on the Moon:
apex-to-antapex ratio of 1.32 +/- 0.01. However, the observed rayed crater
distribution's asymmetry is significantly more pronounced: apex-to-antapex
ratio of 1.65 +/- 0.16. Our results suggest the existence of an undetected
population of slower (low impact velocity) projectiles, such as a population of
objects nearly coorbiting with Earth; more observational study of young lunar
craters is needed to secure this conclusion.

masses M_k and the mixing parameters R_{ek} of N_k as a direct consequence of
the exact seesaw relation, and the effective mass term of \nu_i is in most

0.23 eV (or < 0.85 eV as a more conservative limit) at the 2\sigma level, which
is much stronger than |\sum R^2_{ek} M^{-1}_k| < 5 \times 10^{-8} GeV^{-1} used

The system has to satisfy its specification in all possible environments.
Modern systems often interact with other systems, or agents. Many times these
agents have objectives of their own, other than to fail the system. Thus, it
makes sense to model system environments not as hostile, but as composed of
rational agents; i.e., agents that act to achieve their own objectives. We
introduce the problem of synthesis in the context of rational agents (rational
synthesis, for short). The input consists of a temporal-logic formula
specifying the system and temporal-logic formulas specifying the objectives of
the agents. The output is an implementation T of the system and a profile of
strategies, suggesting a behavior for each of the agents. The output should
satisfy two conditions. First, the composition of T with the strategy profile
should satisfy the specification. Second, the strategy profile should be an
equilibria in the sense that, in view of their objectives, agents have no
incentive to deviate from the strategies assigned to them. We solve the
rational-synthesis problem for various definitions of equilibria studied in
game theory. We also consider the multi-valued case in which the objectives of

environment of young high-mass star-forming complexes. They can compress a
pre-existing molecular cloud and trigger the formation of dense cores. We
investigate whether these phenomena can explain the formation of high-mass
protostars within an infrared dark cloud located at the position of G327.3-0.6
in the Galactic plane, in between two large infrared bubbles and two HII
regions. Methods: The region of G327.3-0.6 was imaged at 450 ? m with the CEA
P-ArT\'eMiS bolometer array on the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment telescope in
Chile. APEX/LABOCA and APEX-2A, and Spitzer/IRAC and MIPS archives data were
used in this study. Results: Ten massive cores were detected in the P-ArT\'eMiS
image, embedded within the infrared dark cloud seen in absorption at both 8 and
24 ?m. Their luminosities and masses indicate that they form high-mass stars.
The kinematical study of the region suggests that the infrared bubbles expand
toward the infrared dark cloud. Conclusions: Under the influence of expanding
bubbles, star formation occurs in the infrared dark areas at the border of HII
regions and infrared bubbles.

completely understood by the formation of two point defects, both depending
strongly on the Oxygen concentration in the silicon bulk. Specific for hadron
irradiation are the annealing effects which decrease resp. increase the

proved to be responsible specifically for the reverse annealing. Their

arise, which is inconsistent with current observations. In this paper, we study
this issue in a mixed scenario where the curvature fluctuations can also be
produced from the inflaton fluctuations as well as those from a light scalar
field such as the modulus and the curvaton. We show that primordial
fluctuations can be highly non-Gaussian without conflicting the current
constraint on isocurvature fluctuations for such mixed scenarios. However, if
the constraint on isocurvature fluctuations becomes severer as expected by the
Planck satellite, $f_{\rm NL}$, a nonlinearity parameter for adiabatic

interesting implications for the generation mechanism of dark matter.

molecular orbitals for the projection of the lattice Green's function onto 2x2
clusters, a considerably more accurate description of the low frequency
properties of the self-energy is achieved than in a pure site picture. The
transition from Fermi-liquid to non-Fermi-liquid behavior for decreasing hole
doping is studied as a function of Coulomb energy, next-nearest neighbor
hopping, and temperature. In particular, the self-energy component Sigma_X
associated with X=(pi,0) is shown to exhibit an onset of non-Fermi-liquid
behavior as the hole doping decreases below a critical value delta_c. The
imaginary part of Sigma_X(omega) then develops a collective mode above E_F,
which exhibits a distinct dispersion with doping. Accordingly, the real part of
Sigma_X(omega) has a positive slope above E_F, giving rise to an increasing
particle-hole asymmetry as the system approaches the Mott transition. This
behavior is consistent with the removal of spectral weight from electron states
close to E_F and the opening of a pseudogap which increases with decreasing
doping. The phase diagram reveals that delta_c = 0.15 ... 0.20 for various
system parameters. For electron doping, the collective mode of Sigma_X(omega)
and the concomitant pseudogap are located below the Fermi energy which is
consistent the removal of spectral weight from hole states just below E_F. The
critical doping which marks the onset of non-Fermi-liquid behavior, is
systematically smaller than for hole doping.

Compared to the external parts, the central region has a deficiency of alpha

orbit extremely close to their star. We use knowledge of hot Jupiters, mass
loss estimates and models for the interior structure and evolution of planets
to understand its composition, structure and evolution. The inferred mass and
radius of CoRoT-7b are consistent with a rocky planet that would be depleted in
iron relative to Earth. However, a one sigma increase in mass (5.6 M_E) and
decrease in size (1.59 R_E) are compatible with an Earth-like composition (33%
iron, 67% silicates). Alternatively, it is possible that CoRoT-7b contains a
significant amount of volatiles. An equally good fit to the data is found for a
vapor envelope equal to 3% (and up to 10%) by mass above an Earth-like nucleus.
Because of its intense irradiation and small size, the planet cannot possess an
envelope of H and He of more than 1/10,000 of its total mass. We show that the
mass loss is significant (~ 10^11 g/s) and independent of planetary
composition. This is because the hydrodynamical escape rate is independent of
the atmosphere's mean molecular mass, and owing to the intense irradiation,
even a bare rocky planet would possess an equilibrium vapor atmosphere thick
enough to capture stellar UV photons. This escape rate rules out the
possibility of a H-He envelope as it would escape in only ~1 Ma. A water vapor
atmosphere would escape in ~ 1 Ga, and thus it is a plausible scenario. The
origin of CoRoT-7b cannot be inferred from present observations: It may have
formed rocky; or be the remnant of a Uranus-like ice giant, or a gas giant with
a small core that was stripped of its gaseous envelope.

parameter, her {\em speed}. In contrast to other similar problems, Archer and
Tardos \cite{AT01} showed that an algorithm that minimizes the makespan can be
truthfully implemented, although in exponential time. On the other hand, if we
leave out the game-theoretic issues, the complexity of the problem has been
completely settled -- the problem is strongly NP-hard, while there exists a
PTAS \cite{HS88,ES04}.
  This problem is the most well studied in single-parameter algorithmic
mechanism design. It gives an excellent ground to explore the boundary between
truthfulness and efficient computation. Since the work of Archer and Tardos,
quite a lot of deterministic and randomized mechanisms have been suggested.
Recently, a breakthrough result \cite{DDDR08} showed that a randomized truthful
PTAS exists. On the other hand, for the deterministic case, the best known
approximation factor is 2.8 \cite{Kov05,Kov07}.
  It has been a major open question whether there exists a deterministic
truthful PTAS, or whether truthfulness has an essential, negative impact on the
computational complexity of the problem. In this paper we give a definitive
answer to this important question by providing a truthful {\em deterministic}
PTAS.

change to nonmagnetic metal upon termination of their edges with hydrogen

the nanoribbons are deformed elastically maintaining honeycomblike structure
but yield at high strains. Beyond yielding point honeycomblike structure
undergo a structural change and deform plastically by forming large polygons.
The variation in the electronic and magnetic properties of these nanoribbons

it allows for the appearance of a new kind of mixed phase as long as neutrinos

Coulomb lattice and it is formed only by spherical structures, drops and

a more compact configuration containing a core of pure quark phase. In this

central concepts of the graph minor theory of Robertson and Seymour. Recently,
Grohe and Marx showed that there are graphs G, in which every bramble of order
larger than the square root of the treewidth is of exponential size in |G|. On
the positive side, they show the existence of polynomial-sized brambles of the
order of the square root of the treewidth, up to log factors. We provide the
first polynomial time algorithm to construct a bramble in general graphs and
achieve this bound, up to log-factors. We use this algorithm to construct
grid-like minors, a replacement structure for grid-minors recently introduced
by Reed and Wood, in polynomial time. Using the grid-like minors, we introduce
the notion of a perfect bramble and an algorithm to find one in polynomial
time. Perfect brambles are brambles with a particularly simple structure and
they also provide us with a subgraph that has bounded degree and still large
treewidth; we use them to obtain a meta-theorem on deciding certain
parameterized subgraph-closed problems on general graphs in time singly
exponential in the parameter.
  The second part of our work deals with providing a lower bound to Courcelle's
famous theorem, stating that every graph property that can be expressed by a
sentence in monadic second-order logic (MSO), can be decided by a linear time
algorithm on classes of graphs of bounded treewidth. Using our results from the

combine this simulation with a model for the conversion between molecular mass

molecular gas is heated by the CMB, starbursts (SBs), and active galactic
nuclei (AGNs); (ii) molecular clouds in dense or inclined galaxies can overlap;
(iii) compact gas can attain a smooth distribution in the densest part of
disks; (iv) CO-luminosities scale with metallicity changes between galaxies;
(v) CO-luminosities are always detected against the CMB. We analyze the
relative importance of these effects and predict the cosmic evolution of the
CO-LFs. The most notable conclusion is that the detection of regular galaxies
(i.e. no AGN, no massive SB) at high z>7 in CO-emission will be dramatically
hindered by the weak contrast against the CMB, in contradiction to earlier
claims that CMB-heating will ease the detection of high-redshift CO. The full

block matrices that makes the Linear Transformation even more convenient.
Moreover, we propose a new-path generation technique based on a Kronecker
Product Approximation. This construction returns the same accuracy of the
Linear Transformation used for the computation of the deltas and the prices in
the case of correlated asset returns while requiring a lower computational
time. All these techniques can be easily employed for stochastic volatility
models based on the mixture of multi-dimensional dynamics introduced by Brigo
et al. (2004).

nanopillars with the free magnetic layer located between two magnetic films of
fixed magnetic moments is considered theoretically. The spin-transfer torque in
the limit of diffusive spin transport is calculated as a function of magnetic
configuration. It is shown that non-collinear magnetic configuration of the
outermost magnetic layers has a strong influence on the spin torque and spin
dynamics of the central free layer. Employing macrospin simulations we make
some predictions on the free layer spin dynamics in spin valves composed of
various magnetic layers. We also present a formula for critical current in
non-collinear magnetic configurations, which shows that the magnitude of
critical current can be several times smaller than that in typical single spin
valves.

decades. This growth can be appreciated in terms of the equipment, such as
switches and links, that have been added, as well as in the number of users
that it supports. In parallel to this expansion, over the past decade the
networking research community has shown a growing interest in discovering and
analyzing the Ethernet topology. Research in this area has concentrated on the
theoretical analysis of Ethernet topology as well as developing tools and
methods for mapping the network layout. These efforts have brought us to a
crucial juncture for Ethernet topology measurement infrastructures: while,
previously, these were both small (in terms of number of measurement points),
we are starting to see the deployment of large-scale distributed systems
composed of hundreds or thousands of monitors. As we look forward to this next
generation of systems, we take stock of what has been achieved so far. In this
survey, we discuss past and current mechanisms for discovering the Ethernet
topology from theoretical and practical prospective. In addition to discovery
techniques, we provide insights into some of the well known open issues related
to Ethernet topology discovery.

infected vertices A \subset V(G) is chosen independently at random, with
density p, and new vertices are subsequently infected if they have at least r
infected neighbours. The set A is said to percolate if eventually all vertices
are infected. Our aim is to understand this process on the grid, [n]^d, for
arbitrary functions n = n(t), d = d(t) and r = r(t), as t -> infinity. The main
question is to determine the critical probability p_c([n]^d,r) at which
percolation becomes likely, and to give bounds on the size of the critical
window. In this paper we study this problem when r = 2, for all functions n and
d satisfying d \gg log n.
  The bootstrap process has been extensively studied on [n]^d when d is a fixed
constant and 2 \leq r \leq d, and in these cases p_c([n]^d,r) has recently been
determined up to a factor of 1 + o(1) as n -> infinity. At the other end of the
scale, Balogh and Bollobas determined p_c([2]^d,2) up to a constant factor, and
Balogh, Bollobas and Morris determined p_c([n]^d,d) asymptotically if d > (log
log n)^{2+\eps}, and gave much sharper bounds for the hypercube.
  Here we prove the following result: let \lambda be the smallest positive root
of the equation \sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k \lambda^k / (2^{k^2-k} k!) = 0, so
\lambda \approx 1.166. Then
  (16\lambda / d^2) (1 + (log d / \sqrt{d})) 2^{-2\sqrt{d}} < p_c([2]^d,2) <
(16\lambda / d^2) (1 + (5(log d)^2 / \sqrt{d})) 2^{-2\sqrt{d}} if d is
sufficiently large, and moreover we determine a sharp threshold for the
critical probability p_c([n]^d,2) for every function n = n(d) with d \gg log n.

dipole antennas. It is located at the site of the KASCADE-Grande experiment at
Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe and measures the radio emission of cosmic ray air
showers in the frequency band from 40 to 80 MHz. LOPES is triggered by KASCADE
and uses the KASCADE reconstruction of the shower axis as an input for the
analysis of the radio pulses. Thereby LOPES works as an interferometer when the
signal of all antennas is digitally merged to form a beam into the shower
direction. To be sensitive to the coherence of the radio signal, a precise time
calibration with an accuracy in the order of 1 ns is required. Thus, it is
necessary to know the delay of each antenna which is time and frequency
dependent. Several calibration measurements are performed to correct for this
delay in the analysis: The group delay of every antenna is measured regularly
(roughly once per year) by recording a test pulse which is emitted at a known
time. Furthermore, the delay is monitored continuously by the so called phase
calibration method: A beacon (a dipole antenna) emits continuously two sine
waves at 63.5 MHz and 68.1 MHz. By that a variation of the delay can be
detected in a subsequent analysis of the radio events as a change of the phase
at these frequencies. Finally, the dispersion of the analog electronics has
been measured to account for the frequency dependence of the delay.

We find the barrier to grow with dimension and we identify the role of
polydispersity in preventing crystal formation. The increased fluid stability
allows us to study the jamming behavior in four, five, and six dimensions and
compare our observations with two recent theories [C. Song, P. Wang, and H. A.
