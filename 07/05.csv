matrix completion problem (for short matrix completion), i.e. the problem of
assigning values to the variables in a given symbolic matrix as to maximize the
resulting matrix rank. Matrix completion belongs to the fundamental problems in
computational complexity with numerous important algorithmic applications,
among others, in computing dynamic transitive closures or multicast network
codings (Harvey et al SODA 2005, Harvey et al SODA 2006).
  We design efficient deterministic algorithms for common generalizations of
the results of Lovasz and Geelen on this problem by allowing linear functions
in the entries of the input matrix such that the submatrices corresponding to
each variable have rank one. We present also a deterministic polynomial time
algorithm for finding the minimal number of generators of a given module
structure given by matrices. We establish further several hardness results
related to matrix algebras and modules. As a result we connect the classical
problem of polynomial identity testing with checking surjectivity (or
injectivity) between two given modules. One of the elements of our algorithm is
a construction of a greedy algorithm for finding a maximum rank element in the
more general setting of the problem. The proof methods used in this paper could
be also of independent interest.

  --Perfect Delaunay polytopes in L, which can be extended to perfect Delaunay

particles in an advection-dominated accretion disk is analyzed using a
transport formalism that includes first-order Fermi acceleration, advection,
spatial diffusion, and the escape of particles through the upper and lower
surfaces of the disk. When a centrifugally-supported shock is present in the
disk, the concentrated particle acceleration occurring in the vicinity of the
shock channels a significant fraction of the binding energy of the accreting
gas into a population of relativistic particles. These high-energy particles
diffuse vertically through the disk and escape, carrying away both energy and
entropy and allowing the remaining gas to accrete. The dynamical structure of
the disk/shock system is computed self-consistently using a model previously
developed by the authors that successfully accounts for the production of the
observed relativistic outflows (jets) in M87 and \SgrA. This ensures that the
rate at which energy is carried away from the disk by the escaping relativistic
particles is equal to the drop in the radial energy flux at the shock location,
as required for energy conservation. We investigate the influence of advection,
diffusion, and acceleration on the particle distribution by computing the
nonthermal Green's function, which displays a relatively flat power-law tail at
high energies. We also obtain the energy distribution for the particles
escaping from the disk, and we conclude by discussing the spectrum of the
observable secondary radiation produced by the escaping particles.

developed into an important area of descriptive set theory. The dichotomies of
Silver and Harrington-Kechris-Louveau show that with respect to Borel
reducibility, any Borel equivalence relation strictly above equality on
$\omega$ is above equality on ${\cal P}(\omega)$, the power set of $\omega$,
and any Borel equivalence relation strictly above equality on the reals is
above equality modulo finite on ${\cal P}(\omega)$. In this article we examine
the effective content of these and related results by studying effectively
Borel equivalence relations under effectively Borel reducibility. The resulting
structure is complex, even for equivalence relations with finitely many
equivalence classes. However use of Kleene's $O$ as a parameter is sufficient
to restore the picture from the noneffective setting. A key lemma is the
existence of two effectively Borel sets of reals, neither of which contains the
range of the other under any effectively Borel function; the proof of this
result applies Barwise compactness to a deep theorem of Harrington establishing

  Summarization",,"Computational Linguistics, 2005",,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Current research in automatic single document summarization is dominated by
two effective, yet naive approaches: summarization by sentence extraction, and
headline generation via bag-of-words models. While successful in some tasks,
neither of these models is able to adequately capture the large set of
linguistic devices utilized by humans when they produce summaries. One possible
explanation for the widespread use of these models is that good techniques have
been developed to extract appropriate training data for them from existing
document/abstract and document/headline corpora. We believe that future
progress in automatic summarization will be driven both by the development of
more sophisticated, linguistically informed models, as well as a more effective
leveraging of document/abstract corpora. In order to open the doors to
simultaneously achieving both of these goals, we have developed techniques for
automatically producing word-to-word and phrase-to-phrase alignments between
documents and their human-written abstracts. These alignments make explicit the
correspondences that exist in such document/abstract pairs, and create a
potentially rich data source from which complex summarization algorithms may
learn. This paper describes experiments we have carried out to analyze the
ability of humans to perform such alignments, and based on these analyses, we
describe experiments for creating them automatically. Our model for the
alignment task is based on an extension of the standard hidden Markov model,
and learns to create alignments in a completely unsupervised fashion. We
describe our model in detail and present experimental results that show that
our model is able to learn to reliably identify word- and phrase-level
alignments in a corpus of <document,abstract> pairs.

about its self-consistent mean value serves as a source for fluctuations in the
geometry through the semi-classical Einstein equations. This linear response
framework is used to investigate both the importance of quantum backreaction

those that depend explicitly upon the linearized metric variation delta g_{cd}

variations, independent of delta g_{cd}. For perturbations of the first kind,
the criterion for the validity of the semi-classical approximation in de Sitter
space is satisfied for fluctuations on all scales well below the Planck scale.
The perturbations of the second kind contain additional massless scalar degrees
of freedom associated with changes of state of the fields on the cosmological
horizon scale. These scalar degrees of freedom arise necessarily from the local
auxiliary field form of the effective action associated with the trace anomaly,
are potentially large on the horizon scale, and therefore can lead to
substantial non-linear quantum backreaction effects in cosmology.

of most low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies imply that these systems may be
younger than their high surface brightness counterparts. We seek to find
observational signatures that can help to constrain the age of blue LSB
galaxies. We use numerical hydrodynamic modelling to study the long-term (~13
Gyr) dynamical and chemical evolution of blue LSB galaxies adopting a sporadic
scenario for star formation. Our models utilize various rates of star formation
and different shapes of the initial mass function (IMF). We complement
hydrodynamic modelling with population synthesis modelling to produce the
integrated B-V colors and Halpha equivalent widths (EW(Ha)). We find that the
mean oxygen abundances, B-V colors, EW(Ha), and the radial fluctuations in the
oxygen abundance, when considered altogether, can be used to constrain the age
of blue LSB galaxies if some independent knowledge of the IMF is available. Our
modelling strongly suggests the existence of a minimum age for blue LSB
galaxies. Model B-V colors and mean oxygen abundances set a tentative minimum
age at 1.5-3.0 Gyr, whereas model EW(Ha) suggest a larger value of order 5-6
Gyr. The latter value may decrease somewhat, if blue LSB galaxies host IMFs
with a truncated upper mass limit. We found no firm evidence that the age of

were combined with photometric data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
and near-infrared data from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), wherever
such data were available. The combined data sets were compared with predictions
of evolutionary synthesis models by Bruzual & Charlot (2003a, 2003b). Current
star formation rates (SFRs) were determined from the H$\alpha$ measurements,
and simplified star formation histories were derived from broad-band and
H$\alpha$ photometry and comparisons with the models. We found that the star
formation rates range within 0.1--1.0 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, with a median rate
of 0.6 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The observed galaxy colours are better explained
by the combination of a continuous SF process with a recent instantaneous SF
burst, than by a combination of several instantaneous bursts, as has been
suggested previously. We compare our results for the star formation rate of the
sample galaxies with that of samples of dwarf galaxies in the Virgo cluster and
find that the BCGs have significantly stronger SFRs. The BCGs follow the
correlation between H$\alpha$ emission and starlight found for dwarf galaxies

a MCSCF wave function as the initial guess, the excited states are accessible;
Entire potential energy surfaces of molecules can be studied more efficiently
than if the simpler Hartree-Fock guess was employed. We show that a small
increase of the MCSCF space can dramatically increase the success probability
of the quantum algorithm, even in regions of the potential energy surface that
are far from the equilibrium geometry. For the treatment of larger systems, a
multi-reference configuration interaction approach is suggested. We demonstrate
that such an algorithm can be used to obtain the energy spectrum of the water
molecule.

  The field of a source located inside inner layer or the cloaked concealment
is completely absorbed by the inner layer and never reaches the outside of the

disrupted by the cloak. There exists no Maxwell EM wavefield can be excited in
a single layer cloaked concealment which is filled by normal material.
Moreover, we find a negative dielectric and positive susceptibility
metamaterial to fill into the concealment, such that the interior EM wave
propagates from the concealment to free space through the single layer cloak.
