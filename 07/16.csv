  Mechanics","21 pages",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech math-ph math.MP physics.class-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The time irreversibility problem is the dichotomy of the reversible
microscopic dynamics and the irreversible macroscopic physics. This problem was
considered by Boltzmann, Poincar\'e, Bogolyubov and many other authors and
though some researchers claim that the problem is solved, it deserves a further
study. In this paper an attempt is performed of the following solution of the
irreversibility problem: a formulation of microscopic dynamics is suggested
which is irreversible in time.
  A widely used notion of microscopic state of the system at a given moment of
time as a point in the phase space and also a notion of trajectory does not
have an immediate physical meaning since arbitrary real numbers are non
observable. In the approach presented in this paper the physical meaning is
attributed not to an individual trajectory but only to a bunch of trajectories
or to the distribution function on the phase space.
  The fundamental equation of the microscopic dynamics in the proposed
""functional"" approach is not the Newton equation but the Liouville equation for
the distribution function of a single particle. Solutions of the Liouville
equation have the property of delocalization which accounts for
irreversibility. It is shown that the Newton equation in this approach appears
as an approximate equation describing the dynamics of the average values of the
position and momenta. Corrections to the Newton equation are computed.

participation is unconditional or the number of actual participants in a
competitive group changes over time. How the fixed group size, prescribed by
social institutions, affects the evolution of cooperation is still unclear. We
propose a model where individuals with heterogeneous social ties might well
engage in differing numbers of Public Goods Games, yet with each Public Goods
Game being constant size during the course of evolution. To do this, we assume
that each focal individual unidirectionally selects a constant number of
interaction partners from his immediate neighbors with probabilities
proportional to the degrees or the reputations of these neighbors,
corresponding to degree-based partner selection or reputation-based partner
selection, respectively. Because of the stochasticity the group formation is
dynamical. In both selection regimes, monotonical dependence of the stationary
density of cooperators on the group size was found, the former over the whole
range but the latter over a restricted range of the renormalized enhancement
factor. Moreover, the reputation-based regime can substantially improve
cooperation. To interpret these differences, the microscopic characteristics of
individuals are probed. We later extend the degree-based partner selection to
general cases where focal individuals have preferences towards their neighbors
of varying social ties to form groups. As a comparison, we as well investigate
the situation where individuals locating on the degree regular graphs choose
their co-players at random. Our results may give some insights into better
understanding the widespread teamwork and cooperation in the real world.

describe the way in which the new JLucid compiler generates STs and CPs. JLucid
also introduces array support.
  Further exploration goes through the additional transformations that the
Lucid family of languages has undergone to enable the use of Java objects and
their members, in the Generic Intensional Programming Language (GIPL), and
Indexical Lucid: first, in the form of JLucid allowing the use of
pseudo-objects, and then through the specifically-designed the Objective Lucid
language. The syntax and semantic definitions of Objective Lucid and the
meaning of Java objects within an intensional program are provided with
discussions and examples.
  Finally, there are many useful scientific and utility routines written in
many imperative programming languages other than Java, for example in C, C++,
Fortran, Perl, etc. Therefore, it is wise to provide a framework to facilitate
inclusion of these languages into the GIPSY and their use by Lucid programs. A
General Imperative Compiler Framework and its concrete implementation is
proposed to address this issue.

from the Luminous Infrared Galaxy (LIRG) NGC 7469, using 8.4 GHz Very Large
Array (VLA) observations at 0.3'' resolution. Our monitoring shows that the
late time evolution of the radio supernova SN 2000ft follows a decline very
similar to that displayed at earlier times of its optically thin phase. The
late time radio emission of SN 2000ft is therefore still being powered by its
interaction with the presupernova stellar wind, and not with the interstellar
medium (ISM). Indeed, the ram pressure of the presupernova wind is \rho_w v_w^2
\approx 7.6E-9 dyn/cm^2, at a supernova age of approximately 2127 days, which
is significantly larger than the expected pressure of the ISM around SN 2000ft.
At this age, the SN shock has reached a distance r_{sh \approx 0.06 pc, and our
observations are probing the interaction of the SN with dense material that was
ejected by the presupernova star about 5820 years prior to its explosion. From
our VLA monitoring, we estimate that the swept-up mass by the supernova shock
after about six years of expansion is \approx 0.29 M_sun, assuming an average
expansion speed of the supernova of 10000 km/s.
  We also searched for recently exploded core-collapse supernovae in our VLA
images. Apart from SN 2000ft (S_\nu \approx 1760 microJy at its peak,
corresponding to 1.1E28 erg/s/Hz, we found no evidence for any other radio
supernova (RSN) more luminous than \approx 6.0E26 erg/s/Hz, which suggests that
no other Type IIn SN has exploded since 2000 in the circumnuclear starburst of
NGC 7469.

framework allows to address general evolutionary games. With only two
parameters describing the preferential attachment and the intensity of

attachment, over represented hubs arise. Interestingly, we find that while the

the mechanism of payoff preferential attachment is different to those usually

solar wind has the lowest density and the least frequent Coulomb collisions.
This makes the fast wind an optimal testing ground for studies of collisionless
kinetic processes associated with the dissipation of plasma turbulence. Data
from the Helios and Ulysses plasma instruments were collected to determine mean
radial trends in the temperatures and the electron heat conduction flux between
0.29 and 5.4 AU. The derived heating rates apply specifically for these mean
plasma properties and not for the full range of measured values around the
mean. We found that the protons receive about 60% of the total plasma heating
in the inner heliosphere, and that this fraction increases to approximately 80%
by the orbit of Jupiter. A major factor affecting the uncertainty in this
fraction is the uncertainty in the measured radial gradient of the electron
heat conduction flux. The empirically derived partitioning of heat between
protons and electrons is in rough agreement with theoretical predictions from a
model of linear Vlasov wave damping. For a modeled power spectrum consisting
only of Alfvenic fluctuations, the best agreement was found for a distribution
of wavenumber vectors that evolves toward isotropy as distance increases.

nuclear spins in a quantum dot with one resident electron is developed for
arbitrary mechanisms of electron spin polarization. The dependence of the
electron-nuclear spin dynamics on the correlation time $\tau_c$ of electron
spin precession, with frequency $\Omega$, in the nuclear hyperfine field is
analyzed. It is demonstrated that the highest nuclear polarization is achieved
for a correlation time close to the period of electron spin precession in the
nuclear field. For these and larger correlation times, the indirect hyperfine
field, which acts on nuclear spins, also reaches a maximum. This maximum is of
the order of the dipole-dipole magnetic field that nuclei create on each other.
This value is non-zero even if the average electron polarization vanishes. It
is shown that the transition from short correlation time to $\Omega\tau_c>1$
does not affect the general structure of the equation for nuclear spin
temperature and nuclear polarization in the Knight field, but changes the
values of parameters, which now become functions of $\Omega\tau_c$. For
correlation times larger than the precession time of nuclei in the electron
hyperfine field, it is found that three thermodynamic potentials ($\chi$,
$\bm{\xi}$, $\varsigma$) characterize the polarized electron-nuclear spin
system. The values of these potentials are calculated assuming a sharp
transition from short to long correlation times, and the relaxation mechanisms
of these potentials are discussed. The relaxation of the nuclear spin potential

representative. We employ general sum rules relating the masses and couplings
of the Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes of the gauge fields in continuum and
deconstructed Higgsless models as a way to compare the different theories. We
show that the size of the four-point vertex for the (unphysical)
Nambu-Goldstone modes and the degree to which the sum rules are saturated by
contributions from the lowest-lying KK resonances both provide good measures of
the extent to which a highly-deconstructed theory can accurately describe the
low-energy physics of a continuum 5d Higgsless model. After comparing the
three-site model to flat and warped continuum models, we analyze extensions of
the three-site model to a longer open linear moose with an additional U(1)
group and to a ring (""BESS' or ""hidden local symmetry"") model with three sites
and three links. Both cases may be readily analyzed in the framework of the
general sum rules. We demonstrate that W_L W_L scattering in the ring model can

optical phenomena in terms of photon trajectories, whose flow yields a
pictorial view of the evolution of the electromagnetic energy density in

here to study and analyze the outcome from Young-type diffraction experiments

trajectories in the region behind the two slits are obtained in the case where
the slits are illuminated by a polarized monochromatic plane wave. Expressions
to determine electromagnetic energy flow lines and photon trajectories within

particular case of gratings totally transparent inside the slits and completely

obtained allow to monitor at each point of space the behavior of the

photons can give rise to a modified Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect in the
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The coupling induces a mixing between
chameleon particles and the CMB photons when they pass through the magnetic
field of a galaxy cluster. Both the intensity and the polarization of the
radiation are modified. The degree of modification depends strongly on the
properties of the galaxy cluster such as magnetic field strength and electron
number density. Existing SZ measurements of the Coma cluster enable us to place
constraints on the photon-chameleon coupling. The constrained conversion
probability in the cluster is P_Coma(204 GHz) < 6.2 * 10^{-5} at 95%
confidence, corresponding to an upper bound on the coupling strength of g_eff <
2.2 * 10^{-8} GeV^-1 or g_eff < 7.2-32.5 * 10^{-10} GeV^-1, depending on the
model that is assumed for the cluster magnetic field structure. We predict the
radial profile of the chameleonic CMB intensity decrement. We find that the
chameleon effect extends further towards the edges of the cluster than the
thermal SZ effect. Thus we might see a discrepancy between the X-ray emission
data and the observed SZ intensity decrement. We further predict the expected
change to the CMB polarization arising from the existence of a chameleon-like
scalar field. These predictions could be verified or constrained by future CMB
experiments.

Using the optical Glauber eccentricity model for initial-state geometry we find
simple and accurate universal energy and centrality trends for the quadrupole

parameter $b$ and center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$). There is no apparent

set up nearly identical to the model of HD 209458b by Cooper & Showman

broadly consistent with theirs but significant differences also emerge. The
atmospheric flow is characterized by a super-rotating equatorial jet, transonic
wind speeds, and eastward advection of heat away from the dayside. We identify
a dynamically-induced temperature inversion (""stratosphere"") on the planetary
dayside and find that temperatures at the planetary limb differ systematically
from local radiative equilibrium values, a potential source of bias for transit
spectroscopic interpretations. While our model atmosphere is quasi-identical to

approximately preserves custodial symmetry and minimal flavour violation (MFV).
We demonstrate this by considering the phenomenology of the Standard Model

Standard Model Higgs and the new scalars to be simultaneously light, with
masses ~ 100 GeV, and in some cases lighter. The discovery of such light
coloured scalars could be a compelling possibility for early LHC runs, due to
their large production cross section, ~100 pb. But the observations equally
allow all the scalars to be heavy (including the Higgs), with masses ~ 1 TeV,

galaxy formation and evolution. Not only is it commonly the strongest
observable line from high-redshift galaxies but from its shape detailed
information about its host galaxy can be revealed. However, due to the
scattering nature of Lya photons increasing their path length in a non-trivial
way, if dust is present in the galaxy the line may be severely suppressed and
its shape altered. In order to interpret observations correctly, it is thus of
crucial significance to know how much of the emitted light actually escapes the
galaxy.
  In the present work, using a combination of high-resolution cosmological
hydro-simulations and an adaptively refinable Monte Carlo Lya radiative
transfer code including an advanced model of dust, the escape fractions f_esc
of Lya radiation from high-redshift (z = 3.6) galaxies are calculated. In
addition to the average escape fraction, the variation of f_esc in different
directions and from different parts of the galaxies is investigated, as well as
the effect on the emergent spectrum.
  Escape fractions from a sample of simulated galaxies of representative
physical properties are found to decrease for increasing galaxy virial mass
M_vir, from f_esc approaching unity for M_vir ~ 10^9 M_sun to f_esc less than
10% for M_vir ~ 10^12 M_sun. In spite of the dust being almost grey, it is
found that the emergent spectrum is affected non-uniformly, with the escape
fraction of photons close to the line center being much higher than of those in
the wings, thus effectively narrowing the Lya line.

on a certain half-plane, where one may also define the classical Hardy spaces

main result shows that for certain cases the following statement holds true.
Given an interval on the boundary of the half-plane of definition and a

  By combining the 2SLAQ and SDSS QSO samples we produce a QSO luminosity
function with an unprecedented combination of precision and dynamic range. With
this we are able to accurately constrain both the bright and faint ends of the
QSO LF. While the overall trends seen in the evolution of the QSO LF appear
similar to pure luminosity evolution, the data show very significant departures
from such a model. Most notably we see clear evidence that the number density
of faint QSOs peaks at lower redshift than bright QSOs: QSOs with Mg>-23 have
space densities which peak at z<1, while QSOs at Mg<-26 peak at z>2. By fitting
simple luminosity function models in narrow Mg intervals we find that this
downsizing is significant at the 99.98 per cent level (abridged).

disappeared, along with the hitherto unexplained high level alignment between

improved CMB cross-power spectrum is then derived from the new maps which
better agrees with that of BOOMRANG. Two important results are hence obtained:
the CMB quadrupole drops to nearly zero, and the power in multiple moment range

cosmological parameters to change considerably, e.g., the total matter density
increases from 0.26 up to 0.32 and the dark energy density decreases from 0.74

maximum relative entropy (MaxREnt) principles of Jaynes - considered as a
function of the moment constraints or their conjugate Lagrangian multipliers -
is endowed with a Riemannian geometric description, based on the second
differential tensor of the entropy or its Legendre transform (negative Massieu
function). The analysis provides a generalised {\it least action bound}
applicable to all Jaynesian systems, which provides a lower bound to the cost
(in generic entropy units) of a transition between inferred positions along a
specified path, at specified rates of change of the control parameters. The
analysis therefore extends the concepts of ""finite time thermodynamics"" to the
generic Jaynes domain, providing a link between purely static (stationary)
inferred positions of a system, and dynamic transitions between these positions
(as a function of time or some other coordinate). If the path is unspecified,
the analysis gives an absolute lower bound for the cost of the transition,
corresponding to the geodesic of the Riemannian hypersurface. The analysis is
applied to (i) an equilibrium thermodynamic system subject to mean internal
energy and volume constraints, and (ii) a flow system at steady state, subject
to constraints on the mean heat, mass and momentum fluxes and chemical reaction
rates. The first example recovers the {\it minimum entropy cost} of a
transition between equilibrium positions, a widely used result of finite-time
thermodynamics. The second example leads to a new {\it minimum entropy

  We calculated the correlations between UD's parameters (size, lifetime,
occurrence rate, proper motion) and magnetic fields (field strength,
inclination, azimuth), and obtained the following results: (1) Both the
lifetime and size of UDs are almost constant regardless of the magnetic field
strength at their emergence site. (2) The speed of UDs increases as the field
inclination angle at their emergence site gets larger. (3) The direction of
movement of UDs is nearly parallel to the direction of the horizontal component

region with weakly inclined field show virtually no proper motion.

Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), in which a carbon-oxygen white dwarf (CO WD) accretes
hydrogen-rich material from a main sequence or a slightly evolved star (WD +MS)
to increase its mass, and explodes when its mass approaches the Chandrasekhar
mass limit. During the mass transfer phase between the two components, an
optically thick wind may occur and the material lost as the wind may exist as
circumstellar material (CSM). Searching the CSM around progenitor star is
helpful to discriminate different progenitor models of SNe Ia. Meanwhile, the
CSM is a source of color excess.The purpose of this paper is to study the color
excess produced from the single-degenerate progenitor model with optically
thick wind, and reproduce the distribution of color excesses of SNe Ia. Meng et
al. (2009) systemically carried out binary evolution calculation of the WD +MS
systems for various metallicities and showed the parameters of the systems
before Roche lobe overflow and at the moment of supernova explosion in Meng &
Yang (2009). With the results of Meng et al. (2009), we calculate the color
excesses of SNe Ia at maximum light via a simple analytic method.We reproduces
the distribution of color excesses of SNe Ia by our binary population synthesis
approach if the velocity of the optically thick wind is taken to be of order of
magnitude of 10 km s$^{\rm -1}$. However, if the wind velocity is larger than
100 km s$^{\rm -1}$, the reproduction is bad.

Implementing 5D numerical relativity codes with the cartoon methods, we perform

simulations are stably performed for a sufficiently long time, as done in the

derive the Landau-Lifshitz pseudo tensor in arbitrary dimensions, and show that
it gives a robust tool for computing the energy flux of gravitational waves.

Miras with periods in the range 100--350 d and mean magnitudes available in two

because of the large extinction, we estimated distances and extinctions for 143
Miras whose H- and Ks-band mean magnitudes are obtained. We find that most are
located at the same distance to within our accuracy. Assuming that the
barycentre of these Miras corresponds to the GC, we estimate its distance
modulus to be 14.58+-0.02(stat.)+-0.11(syst.) mag, corresponding to
8.24+-0.08(stat.)+-0.42(syst.) kpc. We have assumed the distance modulus to the

of the turbulence forcing and of local fluctuation of the velocity dispersion,
on the mass function. In particular, we investigate the influence of a
polytropic equation of state and of the effective adiabatic exponent $\gamma$
and find that it has a drastic influence on the low mass part of the IMF. We
also consider a barotropic equation of state (i.e. a piecewise polytropic eos)
that mimics the thermal behaviour of the molecular gas and compare the
prediction of our theory with the results of numerical simulations and with the
observationally-derived IMF, for cloud parameters which satisfy Larson's type
relations. We find that for clouds whose density is, at all scales, almost an
order of magnitude larger than the density inferred for the CO clumps in the
Galaxy, a good agreement is obtained between the theory and the observed IMF,
suggesting that star formation preferentially occurs in high density
environments. We derive an analytical expression for the IMF which generalizes
the expression previously obtained for the isothermal case. This
easy-to-implement analytical IMF should serve as a template to compare
observational or numerical results with the theory.

is invariant under global $O(2,4)\cap Sp(2,4)$ transformations. We find that
the general solution to the classical equations of motion has no linear term in
the evolution parameter, $\tau$, but only the oscillatory terms, and therefore
cannot represent a particle propagating in spacetime. As a remedy, we consider
a generalisation of the action by adopting a procedure similar to that of Bars
et al., who introduced the concept of a $\tau$ derivative that is covariant
under local Sp(2) transformations between the phase space variables
$x^\mu(\tau)$ and $p^\mu (\tau)$. This system, in particular, is similar to a
rigid particle whose action contains the extrinsic curvature of the world line,
which turns out to be helical in spacetime. Another possible generalisation is
the introduction of a symplectic potential proposed by Montesinos. We show how
the latter approach is related to Kaluza-Klein theories and to the concept of
Clifford space, a manifold whose tangent space at any point is Clifford algebra
Cl(8), a promising framework for the unification of particles and forces.

We find two regimes separated by a characteristic momentum scale $k_G$

momenta and energies, $|\p|,|\w|/c\gg k_G$ (with $c$ the velocity of the
Bogoliubov sound mode), in the infrared (hydrodynamic) regime $|\p|,|\w|/c\ll
k_G$ the normal and anomalous self-energies exhibit singularities reflecting
the divergence of the longitudinal correlation function. In particular, we find
that the anomalous self-energy agrees with the Bogoliubov result
$\Sigan(\p,\w)\simeq\const$ at high-energies and behaves as $\Sigan(\p,\w)\sim
(c^2\p^2-\w^2)^{(d-3)/2}$ in the infrared regime (with $d$ the space

the predictions of Popov's hydrodynamic theory. We argue that the hydrodynamic
limit of the one-particle Green function is fully determined by the knowledge
of the exponent $3-d$ characterizing the divergence of the longitudinal

to a conformal transformation in the case of f(R) theories. We also show with

impose upper bounds on the accessible values of pressure and density, which

functions. The L_IR/L_UV ratio is used to measure dust attenuation. This ratio
does not exhibit a strong evolution with z for the bulk of our sample galaxies

UV luminous sources: galaxies with L_IR/L_UV>10 are more frequent at z>0 than

conversely the most luminous galaxies of our samples (L_UV> 2 10^{10} L_sun$),
detected at z=1, exhibit a lower dust attenuation than the fainter ones.
L_IR/L_UV increases with the K rest-frame luminosity of the galaxies at all the

massive and UV luminous galaxies exhibit quite large specific star formation
rates. LBGs exhibit systematically lower dust attenuation than UV selected

to be located at each dot. Our microscopic studies are consistent with global

$\bar{H}$ of homology cylinders to a certain algebra of Jacobi diagrams. Via
composition $\nabla_{G'}\circ\nabla_G^{-1}$ for any pair of fatgraph spines

combinatorial model for the fundamental path groupoid of Teichmuller space, as
a group of automorphisms of this algebra. The space $\bar{H}$ comes equipped
with a geometrically natural product induced by stacking cylinders on top of
one another and furthermore supports related operations which arise by gluing a
homology handlebody to one end of a cylinder or to another homology handlebody.
We compute how $\nabla_G$ interacts with all three operations explicitly in

basic ideas and formalism of analogue gravity in BECs, with particular emphasis
on the possibility of simulating black holes. The non-relativistic,
'superluminal' modifications of the dispersion relation in a BEC beyond the
hydrodynamic limit make it a particularly interesting model for many scenarios
of quantum gravity phenomenology which consider a possible violation of local
Lorentz invariance at high energies. In particular, these modifications allow
the study of kinematical corrections that such quantum gravity scenarios could
impose on general relativity.
  A simple (1+1)-dimensional acoustic black hole configuration in a BEC is
presented, and its dynamical stability and quasinormal mode spectrum are
studied. Then, an analysis is performed of the Hawking radiation for a
collapsing geometry in which a black hole is created. It is seen that the
superluminality of the dispersion relation leads to a frequency-dependence of
the horizon, which can cause strong qualitative and quantitative modifications
with respect to the standard (Lorentz-invariant) Hawking spectrum. We end with
some considerations related to the possibility of constructing a serious toy
model for Planck-scale gravity understood as an emergent phenomenon, based on
the condensed matter analogy. In particular, we discuss the problem of
diffeomorphism invariance in such a seemingly background-dependent approach and
indicate some possible ideas for how to recover the Einstein equations in the
adequate limit.

well known that below the critical percolation parameter $p_c$ the cluster size
distribution has exponential decay and that power-law behavior of this
distribution can only occur at $p_c$. This behavior is often called ``sharpness
of the percolation transition.'' For theoretical reasons, as well as motivated
by applied research, there is an increasing interest in percolation models with
(weak) dependencies. For instance, biologists and agricultural researchers have
used (stationary distributions of) certain two-dimensional contact-like
processes to model vegetation patterns in an arid landscape (see [20]). In that
context occupied clusters are interpreted as patches of vegetation. For some of
these models it is reported in [20] that computer simulations indicate
power-law behavior in some interval of positive length of a model parameter.
This would mean that in these models the percolation transition is not sharp.
This motivated us to investigate similar questions for the ordinary (``basic'')
$2D$ contact process with parameter $\lambda$. We show, using techniques from
Bollob\'{a}s and Riordan [8, 11], that for the upper invariant measure
${\bar{\nu}}_{\lambda}$ of this process the percolation transition is sharp. If
$\lambda$ is such that (${\bar{\nu}}_{\lambda}$-a.s.) there are no infinite
clusters, then for all parameter values below $\lambda$ the cluster-size
distribution has exponential decay.

XY universality class. The finite size scaling function $\theta(x)$ of the
thermodynamic Casimir force can be expressed in terms of the scaling functions
h'(x) and h(x) of the excess energy density and the excess free energy density.
A priori these quantities depend on the reduced temperature t and the thickness
L_0 of the film. However finite size scaling theory predicts that the scaling
functions depend only on the combination x=t [L_0/\xi_0]^{1/\nu}, where \nu is
the critical exponent and $\xi_0$ the amplitude of the correlation length. We
exploit this fact to compute \theta from Monte Carlo data for the excess energy
density of the improved two-component \phi^4 model on the simple cubic lattice
with free boundary conditions in the short direction. We repeat this exercise
using experimental data for the excess specific heat of 4He films. The finite
size scaling behaviour of the excess specific heat is governed by h''(x), which
is proportional to the scaling function $f_2$ discussed in the literature. We
compare our results with previous work, where the Casimir force has been
computed by taking the derivative of the excess free energy with respect to the
thickness of the film. As a preparative study we have also computed the scaling
functions h'(x) and h(x) for finite L^3 systems with periodic boundary
conditions in all directions, where L is the linear extension of the system.

accounts for the effect on the observed mode frequencies, powers, and damping
rates of the continually varying solar cycle and is pertinent to frequencies
obtained from very long data sets. The third corrects for Sun-as-a-star
observations not seeing all components of the modes. Suitable combinations of
the three correction procedures allow the frequencies obtained from different
sets of data to be compared and enable activity-independent inversions of the
solar interior. As an example of how to apply the corrections we describe those
used to produce a set of definitive Sun-as-a-star frequencies.

this theory is relevant to the theory of test elements in tight closure theory.
One result of that work was that, if $R$ is local and the $R$-module structure
on the injective envelope $E$ of the simple $R$-module can be extended to a
structure as a torsion-free left module over the Frobenius skew polynomial
ring, then $R$ is $F$-pure and has a tight closure test element. One of the
central results of this paper is the converse, namely that, if $R$ is $F$-pure,
then $E$ has a structure as a torsion-free left module over the Frobenius skew
polynomial ring; a corollary is that every $F$-pure local ring of prime
characteristic, even if it is not excellent, has a tight closure test element.
These results are then used, along with embedding theorems for modules over the
Frobenius skew polynomial ring, to show that every excellent (not necessarily
local) $F$-pure ring of characteristic $p$ must have a so-called `big' test
element.

requires spectrum sensing at CR transmitter and further information regarding
the spectrum availability at CR receiver. Redefining the spectrum sensing along
with statistical inference suitable for cognitive radio networks (CRN), we
mathematically derive conditions to allow CR transmitter forwarding packets to
CR receiver under guaranteed outage probability, and prove that the correlation
of localized spectrum availability between a cooperative node and CR receiver
determines effectiveness of the cooperative scheme. Applying our novel
mathematical model to potential hidden terminals in CRN, we illustrate that the
allowable transmission region of a CR, defined as neighborhood, is no longer
circular shape even in a pure path loss channel model. This results in
asymmetric CR links to make bidirectional links generally inappropriate in CRN,
though this challenge can be alleviated by cooperative sensing. Therefore,
spectrum sensing capability determines CRN topology. For multiple cooperative
nodes, to fully utilize spectrum availability, the selection methodology of
cooperative nodes is developed due to limited overhead of information exchange.
Defining reliability as information of spectrum availability at CR receiver
provided by a cooperative node and by applying neighborhood area, we can
compare sensing capability of cooperative nodes from both link and network
perspectives. In addition, due to lack of centralized coordination in dynamic
CRN, CRs can only acquire local and partial information within limited sensing
duration, robust spectrum sensing is therefore proposed. Limits of cooperative
schemes and their impacts on network operation are also derived.

outbursts in the gamma ray relative to the optical/X rays might be surmised to
be enhanced in BL Lacs as these photons are upscattered via the inverse Compton
(IC) process. From the observed correlations among the spectral parameters

distributions of emitting electron as required by the X-ray data of many

both the Thomson (for Low energy BL Lacs) and the Klein-Nishina regimes (mainly
for High energy BL Lacs) and we compute how variability is driven by a smooth
increase of key source parameters, primarily the root mean square electron
energy. The single component SSC source model in the Thomson regime turns out

Wavelet Transform Modulus Maxima (WTMM) methods we investigate the origin of
multifractality in the time series. Series fluctuating according to a qGaussian
distribution, both uncorrelated and correlated in time, are used. For the
uncorrelated series at the border (q=5/3) between the Gaussian and the Levy
basins of attraction asymptotically we find a phase-like transition between
monofractal and bifractal characteristics. This indicates that these may solely
be the specific nonlinear temporal correlations that organize the series into a
genuine multifractal hierarchy. For analyzing various features of
multifractality due to such correlations, we use the model series generated
from the binomial cascade as well as empirical series. Then, within the
temporal ranges of well developed power-law correlations we find a fast
convergence in all multifractal measures. Besides of its practical significance
this fact may reflect another manifestation of a conjectured q-generalized
Central Limit Theorem.

current-driven domain wall dynamics. In particular we examine how domain wall
depinning transitions, driven by thermal activation, are influenced by the
adiabatic and nonadiabatic spin-torques. We find the Arrhenius law that
describes the transition rate for activation over a single energy barrier
remains applicable under currents but with a current-dependent barrier height.
We show that the effective energy barrier is dominated by a linear current
dependence under usual experimental conditions, with a variation that depends
only on the nonadiabatic spin torque coefficient beta.

  (Technical Report)",,,,,"cs.DB cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper introduces a scalable approach for probabilistic top-k similarity
ranking on uncertain vector data. Each uncertain object is represented by a set
of vector instances that are assumed to be mutually-exclusive. The objective is
to rank the uncertain data according to their distance to a reference object.
We propose a framework that incrementally computes for each object instance and
ranking position, the probability of the object falling at that ranking
position. The resulting rank probability distribution can serve as input for
several state-of-the-art probabilistic ranking models. Existing approaches
compute this probability distribution by applying a dynamic programming
approach of quadratic complexity. In this paper we theoretically as well as
experimentally show that our framework reduces this to a linear-time complexity
while having the same memory requirements, facilitated by incremental accessing
of the uncertain vector instances in increasing order of their distance to the
reference object. Furthermore, we show how the output of our method can be used
to apply probabilistic top-k ranking for the objects, according to different
state-of-the-art definitions. We conduct an experimental evaluation on
synthetic and real data, which demonstrates the efficiency of our approach.

tri-bimaximal mixing in order to generate a sizable value of |U_{e3}|, while at
the same time keeping solar neutrino mixing near its measured value, which is
close to sin^2 theta_{12} = 1/3. Three straightforward breaking mechanisms to
generate |U_{e3}| of about 0.1 are considered. For charged lepton corrections,
the suppression of a sizable contribution to sin^2 theta_{12} can be achieved
if CP violation in neutrino oscillations is almost maximal. Generation of the
indicated value of |U_{e3}| of about 0.1 through renormalization group
corrections requires the neutrinos to be quasi-degenerate in mass. The
consistency with the allowed range of sin^2 theta_{12} together with large
running of |U_{e3}| forces one of the Majorana phases to be close to pi. This
implies large cancellations in the effective Majorana mass governing
neutrino-less double beta, constraining it to lie near its minimum allowed
value of m_0 cos 2 theta_{12}, where m_0 is greater than about 0.1 eV. Finally,
explicit breaking of the neutrino mass matrix in the inverted hierarchical and
quasi-degenerate neutrino mass spectrum cases is similarly correlated with the
effective Majorana mass, although to a lesser extent. The implied values for
the atmospheric neutrino mixing angle theta_{23} are given in all cases.

traversing a quark-gluon plasma is calculated. We take the medium excitation
due to collisions to be given by the well known expression for the collisional
drag force. The parton's radiative energy loss contributes to the energy
deposition because each radiated gluon acts as an additional source of
collisional energy loss in the medium. In our model, this leads to a length
dependence on the differential energy loss due to the interactions of radiated
gluons with the medium. The final result, which is a sum of the primary and the
secondary contributions, is then treated as the coefficient of a local
hydrodynamic source term. Results are presented for energy density wave induced

the source spin period and allows us to derive for the first time a long-term
spin-down rate of (1.9 +/- 0.4)E-11 s/s. From this value we infer for SGR
1627-41 a characteristic age of 2.2 kyr, a spin-down luminosity of 4E+34 erg/s
(one of the highest among sources of the same class), and a surface dipole
magnetic field strength of 2E+14 G. These properties confirm the magnetar
nature of SGR 1627-41; however, they should be considered with caution since
they were derived on the basis of a period derivative measurement made using
two epochs only and magnetar spin-down rates are generally highly variable. The
pulse profile, double-peaked and with a pulsed fraction of (13 +/- 2)% in the
2-10 keV range, closely resembles that observed by XMM-Newton in 2008
September. Having for the first time a timing model for this SGR, we also
searched for a pulsed signal in archival radio data collected with the Parkes
radio telescope nine months after the previous X-ray outburst. No evidence for
radio pulsations was found, down to a luminosity level 10-20 times fainter (for
a 10% duty cycle and a distance of 11 kpc) than the peak luminosity shown by
the known radio magnetars.
