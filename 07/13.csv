(-1)^{3(B-L)} survives despite of broken B-L, and group theory uniquely
determines that the only possible Z_2-odd matter multiplets belong to
representation 16. We construct the minimal non-SUSY SO(10) model containing
one scalar 16 for DM and study its predictions below M_{G}. We find that EWSB
occurs radiatively due to DM couplings to the SM Higgs boson. For thermal relic
DM the mass range M_{DM}\sim (0.1-1) TeV is predicted by model perturbativity
up to M_{G}. For M_{DM}\sim (1) TeV to explain the observed cosmic ray
anomalies with DM decays, there exists a lower bound on the spin-independent
direct detection cross section within the reach of planned experiments.

equations on a riemannian manifold. As in a previous paper we define equations
via closed subsets of the 2-jet bundle. Basic existence and uniqueness theorems
are established in a wide variety of settings. However, the emphasis is on
starting with a constant coefficient equation as a model, which then
universally determines an equation on every riemannian manifold which is
equipped with a topological reduction of the structure group to the invariance
group of the model. For example, this covers all branches of the homogeneous
complex Monge-Ampere equation on an almost complex hermitian manifold X.
  In general, for an equation F on a manifold X and a smooth domain D in X, we
give geometric conditions which imply that the Dirichlet problem on D is
uniquely solvable for all continuous boundary functions. We begin by
introducing a weakened form of comparison which has the advantage that local
implies global. We then associate to F two natural ""conical subequations"": a
monotonicity subequation M and the asymptotic interior of F. If X carries a
global M-subharmonic function, then weak comparison implies full comparison.
The asymptotic interior of F is used to formulate boundary convexity and
provide barriers. In combination the Dirichlet problem becomes uniquely
solvable as claimed.
  A considerable portion of the paper is concerned with specific examples. They
include a wide variety of equations which make sense on any riemannian
manifold, and many which hold universally on almost complex or quaternionic
hermitian manifolds, or topologically calibrated manifolds.

  We give an almost complete characterization of the feasible truthful

are: We show that a simple randomized mechanism is group strategyproof and
gives a (2-2/n)-approximation for the social cost, where n is the number of

Using numerical simulations, we estimate the diamond nucleation rate and find
that it increases by many orders of magnitude when the pressure is increased at
constant supersaturation. The reason is that an increase in pressure changes
the local coordination of carbon atoms from three-fold to four-fold. It turns
out to be much easier to nucleate diamond in a four-fold coordinated liquid
than in a liquid with three-fold coordination, because in the latter case the
free-energy cost to create a diamond-liquid interface is higher. We speculate
that this mechanism for nucleation control is relevant for crystallization in
many network-forming liquids. On the basis of our calculations, we conclude
that homogeneous diamond nucleation is likely in carbon-rich stars and unlikely
in gaseous planets.

theoretical scenario that could cause such effects is based on warped
extra-dimensional models and indeed some of the effects were predicted there.
However, a rather simple explanation is that based on a fourth family of quarks
with masses in the range of(400 - 600) GeV. The built-in hierarchy of the
4$\times$4 mixing matrix is such that the $t'$ readily provides a needed {\it
perturbation} ($\approx 15%$) to $\sin 2 \beta$ as measured in $B \to \psi K_s$
and simultaneously is the dominant source of CP asymmetry in $B_s \to \psi
\phi$. The latter mode is theoretically very clean (unlike the others) and
therefore it would be extremely desirable that Fermilab gives a very high
priority to clarify this anomaly at the earliest. 4th family explanation
allows, with relative ease, to accomodate the stringent flavor changing
constraints which usually can be quite challenging for new physics
scenarios.Implications for the LHC are briefly discussed; $t'$ and $b'$ lead to
high $p_t$ multilepton events, in particular $b'$ decays produce rather

the minimum fraction of magnetic energy above the critical scale for buoyancy

analysis and dimension reduction with numerous applications in science and
engineering. However, the standard PCA suffers from the fact that the principal
components (PCs) are usually linear combinations of all the original variables,
and it is thus often difficult to interpret the PCs. To alleviate this
drawback, various sparse PCA approaches were proposed in literature [15, 6, 17,
28, 8, 25, 18, 7, 16]. Despite success in achieving sparsity, some important
properties enjoyed by the standard PCA are lost in these methods such as
uncorrelation of PCs and orthogonality of loading vectors. Also, the total
explained variance that they attempt to maximize can be too optimistic. In this
paper we propose a new formulation for sparse PCA, aiming at finding sparse and
nearly uncorrelated PCs with orthogonal loading vectors while explaining as
much of the total variance as possible. We also develop a novel augmented
Lagrangian method for solving a class of nonsmooth constrained optimization
problems, which is well suited for our formulation of sparse PCA. We show that
it converges to a feasible point, and moreover under some regularity
assumptions, it converges to a stationary point. Additionally, we propose two
nonmonotone gradient methods for solving the augmented Lagrangian subproblems,
and establish their global and local convergence. Finally, we compare our
sparse PCA approach with several existing methods on synthetic, random, and
real data, respectively. The computational results demonstrate that the sparse
PCs produced by our approach substantially outperform those by other methods in
terms of total explained variance, correlation of PCs, and orthogonality of
loading vectors.

living cells, significant efforts have been expended to the fabrication of
track-walking nanomotors possessing two foot-like components that each can bind
or detach from an array of anchorage groups on the track in response to local
events of reagent consumption. The central problem in fabricating bipedal
nanomotors is how the motor as a whole can gain the synergic capacity of
directional track-walking, given the fact that each pedal component alone often
is incapable of any directional drift. Implemented bipedal motors to date solve
this thermodynamically intricate problem by an intuitive strategy that requires
a hetero-pedal motor, multiple anchorage species for the track, and multiple
reagent species for motor operation. Here we presented a detailed molecular
mechanism by which motor-level directionality arises from a homo-pedal motor
along a minimally heterogeneous track. Optimally, the operation may be reduced
to a random supply of a single species of reagents to allow the motor's
autonomous functioning. The mechanism suggests a distinct class of fabrication
targets of drastically reduced system requirements. Intriguingly, a defective
form of the mechanism falls into the realm of the well known Brownian motor

tracer of the host galaxy halo. The surface as well as vertical distribution of
RRLS in the inner Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) are studied to understand
whether these stars are actually formed in the halo. RRLS identified by the
OGLE III survey are used to estimate their number density distribution. The
scale-height of their distribution is estimated using extinction corrected
average magnitudes of ab type stars. The density distribution mimics the bar,
confirming results in the literature. The distribution of their scale height
indicates that there may be two populations, one with smaller scale-height,
very similar to the red clump stars and the other, much larger. The
distribution of the reddening-corrected magnitude along the minor axis shows
variation, suggesting an inclination. The inclination is estimated to be i =
31.3 (3.5) degrees, very similar to the inclination of the disk. Thus, the RRLS
in the inner LMC mimic the bar and inclination of the disk, suggesting that a
major fraction of RRLS is formed in the disk of the LMC. The results indicate
that the RRLS in the inner LMC trace the disk and probably the inner halo. They
do not trace the extended metal-poor halo of the LMC. We suggest that a major
star formation event happened in the LMC at 10-12 Gyrs ago, resulting in the
formation of most of the inner RRLS, as well as probably the globular clusters,
inner halo and the disk of the LMC.

groups, reflecting their overall disk structure: group I members have disks
with a higher degree of flaring than their group II counterparts. We
investigate the 5-35 um Spitzer IRS spectra of a sample of 13 group I sources
and 20 group II sources. We focus on the continuum emission to study the
underlying disk geometry. We have determined the [30/13.5] and [13.5/7]
continuum flux ratios. The 7-um flux excess with respect to the stellar
photosphere is measured, as a marker for the strength of the near-IR emission
produced by the inner disk. We have compared our data to self-consistent
passive-disk model spectra, for which the same quantities were derived. We
confirm the literature result that the difference in continuum emission between
group I and II sources can largely be explained by a different amount of small
dust grains. However, we report a strong correlation between the [30/13.5] and
[13.5/7] flux ratios for Meeus group II sources. Moreover, the [30/13.5] flux
ratio decreases with increasing 7-um excess for all targets in the sample. To
explain these correlations with the models, we need to introduce an artificial
scaling factor for the inner disk height. In roughly 50% of the Herbig Ae/Be
stars in our sample, the inner disk must be inflated by a factor 2 to 3 beyond
what hydrostatic calculations predict. The total disk mass in small dust grains
determines the degree of flaring. We conclude, however, that for any given disk
mass in small dust grains, the shadowing of the outer (tens of AU) disk is
determined by the scale height of the inner disk (1 AU). The inner disk
partially obscures the outer disk, reducing the disk surface temperature. Here,
for the first time, we prove these effects observationally.

determine abundances of helium, nitrogen, oxygen, neon, sulfur, chlorine, argon

suggesting the presence of oxygen abundance variations on spatial scales of
~1-2 kpc. The oxygen abundance in the brightest region No.1 of SBS 0335-052W is
7.22+/-0.07, consistent with previous determinations.Three other HII regions
are much more metal-poor with an unprecedently low oxygen abundance of
12+logO/H=7.01+/-0.07 (region No.2), 6.98+/-0.06 (region No.3), and 6.86+/-0.14

dynamical evolution of magnetic flux tubes in a turbulent rotating convection
zone. We study numerically the rise of magnetic toroidal flux ropes from the
base of a modelled convection zone up to the top of our computational domain
where bipolar patches are formed. We compare the dynamical behaviour of flux
tubes in a fully convective shell possessing self-consistently generated mean
flows such as meridional circulation and differential rotation, with reference
calculations done in a quiet isentropic zone. We find that two parameters
influence the tubes during their rise through the convection zone: the initial
field strength and amount of twist, thus confirming previous findings in
Cartesian geometry. Further, when the tube is sufficiently strong with respect
to the equipartition field, it rises almost radially independently of the
initial latitude (either low or high). By contrast, weaker field cases indicate
that downflows and upflows control the rising velocity of particular regions of
the rope and could in principle favour the emergence of flux through Omega-loop
structures. For these latter cases, we focus on the orientation of bipolar
patches and find that sufficiently arched structures are able to create bipolar
regions with a predominantly East-West orientation. Meridional flow seems to
determine the trajectory of the magnetic rope when the field strength has been
significantly reduced near the top of the domain. Finally differential rotation
makes it more difficult for tubes introduced at low latitudes to reach the top
of the domain.

addition. The enhanced TCR and MR at / near room temperature open up the
possibility of the use of such materials as infrared bolometric and magnetic

Returns data have histories which greatly vary in length, since assets begin
public trading at different times. This can lead to a huge amount of missing
data--too much for the conventional imputation-based approach. Fortunately, a
well-known factorization of the MVN likelihood under the prevailing historical
missingness pattern leads to a simple algorithm of OLS regressions that is much
more reliable. When there are more assets than returns, however, OLS becomes
unstable. Gramacy, et al. (2008), showed how classical shrinkage regression may
be used instead, thus extending the state of the art to much bigger asset
collections, with further accuracy and interpretation advantages. In this
paper, we detail a fully Bayesian hierarchical formulation that extends the
framework further by allowing for heavy-tailed errors, relaxing the historical
missingness assumption, and accounting for estimation risk. We illustrate how
this approach compares favorably to the classical one using synthetic data and
an investment exercise with real returns. An accompanying R package is on CRAN.

are the expected first order phase transition from partonic to hadronic matter,
ending in a critical point, and modifications of hadron properties in the dense
medium as a signal of chiral symmetry restoration. Laid out as a fixed-target
experiment at the heavy-ion synchrotrons SIS-100/300, the detector will record
both proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions at beam energies between 10
and 45$A$ GeV. Hadronic, leptonic and photonic observables have to be measured
with large acceptance. The interaction rates will reach 10 MHz to measure
extremely rare probes like charm near threshold. Two versions of the experiment
are being studied, optimized for either electron-hadron or muon identification,
combined with silicon detector based charged-particle tracking and micro-vertex
detection. The CBM physics requires the development of novel detector sytems,
trigger and data acquisition concepts as well as innovative real-time

significantly due to its finite Ohmic loss, especially for transverse-magnetic

serve as an efficient TM reflector, reducing propagation loss of the TM mode by
two orders of magnitude. By further imposing a conventional metal cladding

is that extended scalar sectors will generically lead to flavour changing
neutral currents, which are strongly constrained by experiments. Due to the
large parameter space in the scalar sector such models will, however, usually
have no big problems with existing and future bounds (even though the models
might be constrained). This changes considerably once a flavour symmetry is
imposed in addition: Due to the symmetry, additional relations between the
different couplings arise and cancellations become impossible in certain cases.
The experimental bounds will then constrain the model severely and can easily
exclude it. We consider two examples which show how these considerations are
realized. The same logic should apply to a much wider class of models.

is an essential question to resolve. In the Sun an enhancement of the elements
with low first ionization potential (FIP) is observed in the corona with
respect to the photosphere. Stars with high levels of activity seem to show a
depletion of elements with low FIP when compared to solar standard values;
however the few cases of active stars in which photospheric values are
available for comparison lead to confusing results, and an enlargement of the
sample is mandatory for solving this longstanding problem. Aims: We calculate
in this paper the photospheric and coronal abundances of two well known active
binary systems, AR Psc and AY Cet, to get further insight into the
complications of coronal abundances. Methods: Coronal abundances of 9 elements
were calculated by means of the reconstruction of a detailed emission measure
distribution, using a line-based method that considers the lines from different
elements separately. Photospheric abundances of 8 elements were calculated
using high-resolution optical spectra of the stars. Results: The results once
again show a lack of any FIP-related effect in the coronal abundances of the
stars. The presence of metal abundance depletion (MAD) or inverse FIP effects
in some stars could stem from a mistaken comparison to solar photospheric
values, or from a deficient calculation of photospheric abundances in
fast-rotating stars. Conclusions: The lack of FIP fractionation seems to
confirm that Alfven waves combined with pondermotive forces are dominant in the
corona of active stars.

conformal invariance for superstrings in type IIB R-R plane-wave in
semi-light-cone gauge. Here we give further justification to the results found
in that work through alternative arguments using dynamical supersymmetries. We
show that by using the susy algebra the same quantum definition of the
energy-momentum (EM) tensor can be derived. Furthermore, using certain Jacobi
identities we indirectly compute the Virasoro anomaly terms by calculating
second order susy variation of the EM tensor. Certain integrated form of all
such terms are shown to vanish. In order to deal with various divergences that
appear in such computations we take a point-split definition of the same EM
tensor. The final results are shown not to suffer from the ordering ambiguity
as noticed in the previous work provided the coincidence limit is taken before
sending the regularization parameter to zero at the end of the computation.

play major roles in quantum teleportation, quantum cloning and quantum

yet been demonstrated. It is made difficult by the no-go theorem stating that
no Gaussian operation can distill Gaussian states. Here we demonstrate the
entanglement distillation from Gaussian states by using measurement-induced
non-Gaussian operations, circumventing the fundamental restriction of the no-go
theorem. We observed a gain of entanglement as a result of conditional local
subtraction of a single photon or two photons from a two-mode Gaussian state.
Furthermore we confirmed that two-photon subtraction also improves
Gaussian-like entanglement as specified by the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)
correlation. This distilled entanglement can be further employed to downstream
applications such as high fidelity quantum teleportation and a loophole-free
Bell test.

cannot account for the high elliptic flow values, the smaller mean free path in

realistic initial conditions and the incorporated hadronic rescattering the
results are in line with the experimental data. Within this integrated

to explore the properties of newly discovered B-type pulsators from the
uninterrupted CoRoT space-based photometry and to compare them with known
members of the Beta Cep and slowly pulsating B star (SPB) classes. We developed
automated data analysis tools that include algorithms for jump correction,
light-curve detrending, frequency detection, frequency combination search, and
for frequency and period spacing searches. Besides numerous new, classical,
slowly pulsating B stars, we find evidence for a new class of low-amplitude
B-type pulsators between the SPB and Delta Sct instability strips, with a very
broad range of frequencies and low amplitudes, as well as several slowly
pulsating B stars with residual excess power at frequencies typically a factor
three above their expected g-mode frequencies. The frequency data we obtained
for numerous new B-type pulsators represent an appropriate starting point for
further theoretical analyses of these stars, once their effective temperature,
gravity, rotation velocity, and abundances will be derived spectroscopically in
the framework of an ongoing FLAMES survey at the VLT.

Galactic Clusters Survey (GCS) to derive the cluster luminosity and mass
functions, evaluate the extent of the cluster, and study the distribution and
variability of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs down to the deuterium-burning
limit. We have recovered most of the previously published members and found a
total of 287 candidate members within the central 30 arcmin in the 0.5-0.009
Msun mass range, including new objects not previously reported in the
literature. This new catalogue represents a homogeneous dataset of brown dwarf
member candidates over the central 30 arcmin of the cluster. The expected
photometric contamination by field objects with similar magnitudes and colours
to sigma Orionis members is ~15%. We present evidence of variability at the
99.5% confidence level over ~yearly timescales in 10 member candidates that
exhibit signs of youth and the presence of disks. The level of variability is
low (<0.3 mag) and does not impact the derivation of the cluster luminosity and
mass functions. Furthermore, we find a possible dearth of brown dwarfs within
the central five arcmin of the cluster, which is not caused by a lower level of
photometric sensitivity around the massive, O-type multiple star sigma Ori in
the GCS survey. Using state-of-the-art theoretical models, we derived the
luminosity and mass functions within the central 30 arcmin from the cluster
centre, with completeness down to J = 19 mag, corresponding to masses ranging
from 0.5 Msun down to the deuterium-burning mass boundary (~0.013 Msun). The
mass function of sigma Orionis in this mass interval shows a power law index

graphs, we discuss how various tests of General Relativity (GR) can be
translated into measurement of the three- and four-graviton vertices. In
problems involving only the conservative dynamics of a system, a deviation of
the three-graviton vertex from the GR prediction is equivalent, to lowest
order, to the introduction of the parameter beta_{PPN} in the parametrized
post-Newtonian formalism, and its strongest bound comes from lunar laser
ranging, which measures it at the 0.02% level. Deviation of the three-graviton
vertex from the GR prediction, however, also affects the radiative sector of
the theory. We show that the timing of the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar provides
a bound on the deviation of the three-graviton vertex from the GR prediction at
the 0.1% level. For coalescing binaries at interferometers we find that,
because of degeneracies with other parameters in the template such as mass and
spin, the effects of modified three- and four-graviton vertices is just to
induce an error in the determination of these parameters and, at least in the
restricted PN approximation, it is not possible to use coalescing binaries for
constraining deviations of the vertices from the GR prediction.

homological relationships in large molecular databases. It can be mapped on the
physical model of directed polymers in random media. We consider the
finite-temperature version of local sequence alignment for proteins and study
the transition between the linear phase and the biologically relevant
logarithmic phase, where the free-energy grows linearly or logarithmically with
the sequence length. By means of numerical simulations and finite-size scaling
analysis we determine the phase diagram in the plane that is spanned by the gap
costs and the temperature. We use the most frequently used parameter set for
protein alignment. The critical exponents that describe the parameter driven
transition are found to be explicitly temperature dependent.
  Furthermore, we study the shape of the (free-) energy distribution close to
the transition by rare-event simulations down to probabilities of the order
$10^{-64}$. It is well known that, in the logarithmic region, the optimal score
distribution (T=0) is described by a modified Gumbel distribution. We confirm
that this also applies for the free-energy distribution ($T>0$). However, in
the linear phase, the distribution crosses over to a modified Gaussian
distribution.

different hadron species within the framework of HYDJET++ Monte-Carlo model.
The model contains both hydrodynamic state and jets, thus allowing for a study
of the interplay between the soft and hard processes. It is found that jets are
terminating the rise of the elliptic flow with increasing transverse momentum.
Since jets are more influential at LHC compared to RHIC, the elliptic flow at
LHC should be weaker than that at RHIC. The influence of resonance decays on
particle elliptic flow is investigated also. These final state interactions
enhance the low-p_T part of the v_2 of pions and light baryons, and work
towards the fulfilment of idealized constituent quark scaling.
