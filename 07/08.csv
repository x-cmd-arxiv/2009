narrow, time-variable Na I D absorption features. The origin of the absorbing
material is controversial, but it may suggest the presence of circumstellar gas
in the progenitor system prior to the explosion, with significant implications
for the nature of the supernova progenitors. We present the third detection of
such variable absorption, based on six epochs of high-resolution spectroscopy
of the Type Ia supernova SN 2007le from Keck and the HET. The data span ~3
months, from 5 days before maximum light to 90 days after maximum. We find that
one component of the Na D absorption lines strengthened significantly with
time, indicating a total column density increase of ~2.5 x 10^12 cm^-2. The
changes are most prominent after maximum light rather than at earlier times
when the UV flux from the SN peaks. As with SN 2006X, we detect no change in
the Ca II H&K lines over the same time period, rendering line-of-sight effects
improbable and suggesting a circumstellar origin for the absorbing material.
Unlike the previous two SNe exhibiting variable absorption, SN 2007le is not
highly reddened (E_B-V = 0.27 mag), also pointing toward circumstellar rather
than interstellar absorption. Photoionization models show that the data are
consistent with a dense (10^7 cm^-3) cloud or clouds of gas located ~0.1 pc
from the explosion. These results broadly support the single-degenerate
scenario previously proposed to explain the variable absorption, with mass loss
from a nondegenerate companion star responsible for providing the circumstellar
gas. We also present tentative evidence for narrow Halpha emission associated
with the SN, which will require followup observations at late times to confirm.

~10 kpc from the Sun and ~15 kpc from the Galactic center, is presumed to be
debris from a tidally disrupted star cluster that traces out a test-particle
orbit in the Milky Way halo. We combine SDSS photometry, USNO-B astrometry, and
SDSS and Calar Alto spectroscopy to construct a complete, empirical
6-dimensional phase-space map of the stream. We find that an eccentric orbit in
a flattened isothermal potential describes this phase-space map well. Even
after marginalizing over the stream orbital parameters and the distance from
the Sun to the Galactic center, the orbital fit to GD-1 places strong
constraints on the circular velocity at the Sun's radius V_c=224 \pm 13 km/s
and total potential flattening q_\Phi=0.87^{+0.07}_{-0.04}. When we drop any
informative priors on V_c the GD-1 constraint becomes V_c=221 \pm 18 km/s. Our
6-D map of GD-1 therefore yields the best current constraint on V_c and the
only strong constraint on q_\Phi at Galactocentric radii near R~15 kpc. Much,
if not all, of the total potential flattening may be attributed to the mass in
the stellar disk, so the GD-1 constraints on the flattening of the halo itself
are weak: q_{\Phi,halo}>0.89 at 90% confidence. The greatest uncertainty in the
6-D map and the orbital analysis stems from the photometric distances, which
will be obviated by Gaia.

closed string carrying electric current. The charge carriers on the string must
be consistent with the charge used to quantize the Dirac solenoidal flux. This
yields the Chern-Simons term coefficient. In higher odd D the intersection of
(D-1)/2 Dirac branes yields a charged world-line permitting the consistency

further malfunction of additional nodes in the first network and so on. Such a
cascade of failures, triggered by a failure of a small faction of nodes in only
one network, may lead to the complete fragmentation of all networks. We
introduce a model and an analytical framework for studying interdependent
networks. We obtain interesting and surprising results that should
significantly effect the design of robust real-world networks. For two
interdependent Erdos-Renyi (ER) networks, we find that the critical average
degree below which both networks collapse is <k_c>=2.445, compared to <k_c>=1
for a single ER network. Furthermore, while for a single network a broader
degree distribution of the network nodes results in higher robustness to random
failure, for interdependent networks, the broader the distribution is, the more
vulnerable the networks become to random failure.

to study properties of many-electron systems. Due to the nonlinearity of the
Kohn-Sham equations, the general self-consistence searching method involves
iterations with alternate solving of the Poisson and Schr\""{o}dinger equations.
One of problems of such an approach is that the charge distribution renewed by
means of the Schr\""{o}dinger equation solution does not conform to boundary
conditions of Poisson equation for Coulomb potential. The resulting instability
or even divergence of iterations manifests itself most appreciably in the case
of infinitely extended systems. The published attempts to deal with this
problem are reduced in fact to abandoning the original iterative method and
replacing it with some approximate calculation scheme, which is usually
semi-empirical and does not permit to evaluate the extent of deviation from the
exact solution. In this work, we realize the iterative scheme of solving the
Kohn-Sham equations for extended systems with inhomogeneous electron gas, which
is based on eliminating the long-range character of Coulomb interaction as the
cause of tight coupling between charge distribution and boundary conditions.
The suggested algorithm is employed to calculate energy spectrum,
self-consistent potential, and electrostatic capacitance of the semi-infinite
degenerate electron gas bounded by infinitely high barrier, as well as the work
function and surface energy of simple metals in the jellium model. The
difference between self-consistent Hartree solutions and those taking into
account the exchange-correlation interaction is analyzed. The case study of the
metal-semiconductor tunnel contact shows this method being applied to an
infinitely extended system where the steady-state current can flow.

allows an opportunistic multiple input multiple output (MIMO) link (secondary)
to harmlessly coexist with another MIMO link (primary) in the same frequency
band. Assuming perfect channel knowledge at the primary receiver and
transmitter, capacity is achieved by transmiting along the spatial directions
(SD) associated with the singular values of its channel matrix using a
water-filling power allocation (PA) scheme. Often, power limitations lead the
primary transmitter to leave some of its SD unused. Here, it is shown that the
opportunistic link can transmit its own data if it is possible to align the
interference produced on the primary link with such unused SDs. We provide both
a processing scheme to perform IA and a PA scheme which maximizes the
transmission rate of the opportunistic link. The asymptotes of the achievable
transmission rates of the opportunistic link are obtained in the regime of
large numbers of antennas. Using this result, it is shown that depending on the
signal-to-noise ratio and the number of transmit and receive antennas of the
primary and opportunistic links, both systems can achieve transmission rates of
the same order.

  the Use of RAM for True Random Number Generation on RFID Tags (RFIDSec 2009)","Presented at the 5th Workshop on RFID Security held from June 30 -
  July 2 in Leuven, Belgium. Paper is 13 pages with 4 figures",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Random number generation is a fundamental security primitive for RFID
devices. However, even this relatively simple requirement is beyond the
capacity of today's average RFID tag. A recently proposed solution, Fingerprint
Extraction and Random Number Generation in SRAM (FERNS) [14, 15], involves the
use of onboard RAM as the source of ""true"" randomness. Unfortunately, practical
considerations prevent this approach from reaching its full potential. First,
this method must compete with other system functionalities for use of memory.
Thus, the amount of uninitialized RAM available for utilization as a randomness
generator may be severely restricted. Second, RAM is subject to data remanence;
there is a time period after losing power during which stored data remains
intact in memory. This means that after a portion of memory has been used for
entropy collection once it will require a relatively extended period of time
without power before it can be reused. In a usable RFID based security
application, which requires multiple or long random numbers, this may lead to
unacceptably high delays.
  In this paper, we show that data remanence negatively affects RAM based
random number generation. We demonstrate the practical considerations that must
be taken into account when using RAM as an entropy source. We also discuss the
implementation of a true random number generator on Intel's WISP RFID tag,
which is the first such implementation to the authors' best knowledge. By
relating this to the requirements of some popular RFID authentication
protocols, we assess the (im)practicality of utilizing memory based randomness
techniques on resource constrained devices.

show that the system belongs to the universality class of
paramagnetic-ferromagnetic -helical systems. We vary the coupling constant of
the theory, which is obtained from integrating out the gluonic degrees of
freedom. In weak coupling, the FF phase is favored at arbitrary flavor
asymmetries for sufficiently low temperatures; at intermediate coupling its
occupancy domain is shifted towards larger asymmetries. Strong coupling
features a new regime of an inhomogeneous FF state, which we identify with a
current-carrying Bose-Einstein condensate of tightly bound up and down quarks.
We analyze the occupation numbers and the Cooper-pair wave function and show
that when the condensate momentum is orthogonal to the particle momentum the
minority component contains a blocking region (breach) around the Fermi sphere
in the weak-coupling limit, which engulfs more low-momentum modes as the
coupling is increased, and eventually leads to a topological change in strong
coupling, where the minority Fermi sphere contains either two occupied strips
or an empty sphere. For non-orthogonal momenta, the blocking region is either
reduced or extinct, i.e., no topological changes are observed.

domain wall boundary conditions in its disordered regime is addressed. It is
well-known that in the scaling limit the model exhibits phase-separation, with
regions of order and disorder sharply separated by a smooth curve, called the
arctic curve. To find this curve, we study a multiple integral representation
for the emptiness formation probability, a correlation function devised to
detect spatial transition from order to disorder. We conjecture that the arctic
curve, for arbitrary choice of the vertex weights, can be characterized by the
condition of condensation of almost all roots of the corresponding saddle-point
equations at the same, known, value. In explicit calculations we restrict to
the disordered regime for which we have been able to compute the scaling limit
of certain generating function entering the saddle-point equations. The arctic
curve is obtained in parametric form and appears to be a non-algebraic curve in
general; it turns into an algebraic one in the so-called root-of-unity cases.
The arctic curve is also discussed in application to the limit shape of
$q$-enumerated (with $0<q\leq 4$) large alternating sign matrices. In
particular, as $q\to 0$ the limit shape tends to a nontrivial limiting curve,
given by a relatively simple equation.

forward in time, starting from a large phase space of initial semi-major axes
and eccentricities. Given observational constraints at the current time for a
given planet (semi-major axis, eccentricity, and system age) we find possible
evolutionary paths that match these constraints, and compare the calculated
radii to observations. We find that tidal evolution has two effects. First,
planets start their evolution at larger semi-major axis, allowing them to
contract more efficiently at earlier times. Second, tidal heating can
significantly inflate the radius when the orbit is being circularized, but this
effect on the radius is short-lived thereafter. Often circularization of the
orbit is proceeded by a long period while the semi-major axis slowly decreases.
Some systems with previously unexplained large radii that we can reproduce with
our coupled model are HAT-P-7, HAT-P-9, WASP-10, and XO-4. This increases the
number of planets for which we can match the radius from 24 (of 45) to as many
as 35 for our standard case, but for some of these systems we are required to
be viewing them at a special time around the era of current radius inflation.
This is a concern for the viability of tidal inflation as a general mechanism
to explain most inflated radii. Also, large initial eccentricities would have
to be common. We also investigate the evolution of models that have a floor on
the eccentricity, as may be due to a perturber. In this scenario we match the
extremely large radius of WASP-12b. (Abridged)

its applications to integrability of Hamiltonian partial differential
equations. Such an equation is called integrable if it can be included in an
infinite hierarchy of compatible Hamiltonian equations, which admit an infinite
sequence of linearly independent integrals of motion in involution. The
construction of a hierarchy and its integrals of motion is achieved by making
use of the so called Lenard scheme. We find simple conditions which guarantee
that the scheme produces an infinite sequence of closed 1-forms \omega_j, j in
Z_+, of the variational complex \Omega. If these forms are exact, i.e. \omega_j
are variational derivatives of some local functionals \int h_j, then the latter
are integrals of motion in involution of the hierarchy formed by the
corresponding Hamiltonian vector fields. We show that the complex \Omega is
exact, provided that the algebra of functions V is ""normal""; in particular, for
arbitrary V, any closed form in \Omega becomes exact if we add to V a finite
number of antiderivatives. We demonstrate on the examples of KdV, HD and CNW
hierarchies how the Lenard scheme works. We also discover a new integrable
hierarchy, which we call the CNW hierarchy of HD type. Developing the ideas of
Dorfman, we extend the Lenard scheme to arbitrary Dirac structures, and
demonstrate its applicability on the examples of the NLS, pKdV and KN
hierarchies.

large everywhere on the Fermi surface in the underdoped regime, as evidenced by
a flat $\kappa (H)$ at $T \to 0$, to strongly $k$-dependent in the overdoped

They can be employed to quantify the accuracy of numerical solutions to the
inhomogeneous many-body problem like strongly correlated multilayered devices,
ultracold atoms in an optical lattice with a trap potential, strongly
correlated systems that are disordered, or systems with nontrivial spatial
ordering like a charge density wave or a spin density wave. We also show how
the spectral moment sum rules determine the asymptotic behavior of the Green

illustrate in detail how one can dramatically reduce the number of Matsubara
frequencies needed to solve the Falicov-Kimball model, while still retaining
high precision, and we sketch how one can incorporate these results into
Hirsch-Fye quantum Monte Carlo solvers for the Hubbard (or more complicated)

consuming than periodic systems, efficient use of these sum rules can provide a
dramatic speed up in the computational time required to solve the many-body

nonlocality of bipartite finite-dimensional systems (bipartite qudits).
Entanglement is one of the most fascinating non-classical features of quantum
theory, and besides its impact on our view of the world, it can be exploited
for applications such as quantum cryptography and quantum computing. (...)
Although entanglement and nonlocality are ordinarily regarded as one and the
same, under close consideration this cannot be taken for granted. The reason
for this is that entanglement is defined by the mathematical structure of a
quantum state in a composite Hilbert space, whereas nonlocality signifies that
the statistical behaviour of a system cannot be described by a local realistic
theory. For the latter it is essential that the correlation probabilities of
such theories obey so-called Bell inequalities, which are violated for certain
quantum states. The main focus of this thesis is on the comparison of both
properties with the objective of understanding their relation. (...) Because of
the fact that the correlation probabilities in general depend on the
measurement settings it is necessary to optimise these in order to reveal
nonlocality. This problem is solved for a particular Bell inequality (CGMLP) by
means of a self-developed numerical search algorithm. The method is then
applied to density matrices of a subspace spanned by the projectors of
maximally entangled two-qudit states. This set of states (...) serves to
visualise and analyse the state space geometrically.

parameterized algorithms for the problems of finding items in an unsorted list
of linearly ordered items based on their rank (selection) or value (search). As
a side-effect of answering these online selection and search queries, we
progressively sort the list. Our algorithms are based on Hoare's Quickselect,
and are parameterized based on the pivot selection method.
  For example, if we choose the pivot as the last item in a subinterval, our
framework yields algorithms that will answer q<=n unique selection and/or
search queries in a total of O(n log q) average time. After q=\Omega(n) queries
the list is sorted. Each repeated selection query takes constant time, and each
repeated search query takes O(log n) time. The two query types can be
interleaved freely. By plugging different pivot selection methods into our
framework, these results can, for example, become randomized expected time or
deterministic worst-case time. Our methods are easy to implement, and we show
they perform well in practice.

which is perpendicular to a set of vectors, each of which lies in the Hilbert
space of k qubits. Equivalently, the problem is to decide whether a particular
type of local Hamiltonian has a ground state with zero energy. We consider
random quantum k-SAT formulas with n variables and m = \alpha n clauses, and
ask at what value of \alpha these formulas cease to be satisfiable. We show
that the threshold for random quantum 3-SAT is at most 3.594. For comparison,
convincing arguments from statistical physics suggest that the classical 3-SAT
threshold is \alpha \approx 4.267. For larger k, we show that the quantum
threshold is a constant factor smaller than the classical one. Our bounds work
by determining the generic rank of the satisfying subspace for certain gadgets,
and then using the technique of differential equations to analyze various
algorithms that partition the hypergraph into a collection of these gadgets.
Our use of differential equation to establish upper bounds on a satisfiability
threshold appears to be novel, and our techniques may apply to various
classical problems as well.

two-dimensions the crystal field causes the disappearance of the phase
transition, and ordering takes place via a continuous increase in the value of
the order parameter. This is also true in three dimensions for the dipolar
potential. For the quadrupolar potential in three dimensions turning on the
crystal field leads to the appearance of critical points where the phase
transition ceases, and ordering occurs via a continuous increase in the order
parameter. As the crystal field is increased the range of the coupling constant

the $sd$ shell, the binding energies are strongly affected by the truncation,
but the effect on the excitation energies is an order of magnitude smaller. We
then refit the matrix elements of the two-particle interaction to compensate
for the space truncation, and find that it is easy to capture 90% of the
binding energy shifts by refitting a few parameters. With the full parameter
space of the two-particle Hamiltonian, we find that both the binding energies
and the excitation energy can be fitted with remaining residual error about 5%
of the average error from the truncation. Numerically, the rms initial error
associated with our Hamiltonian is 3.4 MeV and the remaining residual error is
0.16 MeV. This is comparable to the empirical error found in $sd$-shell

finite shapes. We work in the multiple temperature model that was introduced by
Aggarwal, Cheng, Goldwasser, Kao, and Schweller (Complexities for Generalized
Models of Self-Assembly, SODA 2004). The multiple temperature model is a
natural generalization of Winfree's abstract tile assembly model, where the
temperature of a tile system is allowed to be shifted up and down as
self-assembly proceeds. We first exhibit two constant-size tile sets in which
scaled-up versions of arbitrary shapes self-assemble. Our first tile set has
the property that each scaled shape self-assembles via an asymptotically
""Kolmogorov-optimum"" temperature sequence but the scaling factor grows with the
size of the shape being assembled. In contrast, our second tile set assembles
each scaled shape via a temperature sequence whose length is proportional to
the number of points in the shape but the scaling factor is a constant
independent of the shape being assembled. We then show that there is no
constant-size tile set that can uniquely assemble an arbitrary (non-scaled,
connected) shape in the multiple temperature model, i.e., the scaling is
necessary for self-assembly. This answers an open question of Kao and Schweller
(Reducing Tile Complexity for Self-Assembly Through Temperature Programming,
SODA 2006), who asked whether such a tile set existed.

transition metal and rare earth oxides is a scientific challenge of
considerable technological importance. We show how significant information
about the charge distribution around vacancies in cerium oxide can be gained
from a study of high resolution crystal structures of higher order oxides which
exhibit ordering of oxygen vacancies. Specifically, we consider the
implications of a bond valence sum analysis of Ce$_{7}$O$_{12}$ and
Ce$_{11}$O$_{20}$. To illuminate our analysis we show alternative
representations of the crystal structures in terms of orderly arrays of
co-ordination defects and in terms of flourite-type modules. We found that in
Ce$_{7}$O$_{12}$, the excess charge resulting from removal of an oxygen atom
delocalizes among all three triclinic Ce sites closest to the O vacancy. In
Ce$_{11}$O$_{20}$, the charge localizes on the next nearest neighbour Ce atoms.
Our main result is that the charge prefers to distribute itself so that it is
farthest away from the O vacancies. This contradicts \emph{the standard picture
of charge localisation} which assumes that each of the two excess electrons
localises on one of the cerium ions nearest to the vacancy. This standard
picture is assumed in most calculations based on density functional theory
(DFT). Based on the known crystal structure of Pr$_{6}$O$_{11}$, we also
predict that the charge in Ce$_{6}$O$_{11}$ will be found in the second
coordination shell of the O vacancy. Although this review focuses on bulk
cerium oxides our approach to characterising electronic properties of oxygen
vacancies and the physical insights gained should also be relevant to surface
defects and to other rare earth and transition metal oxides.

radiation by astronomical masers in one-dimensional case. The basic equations
appropriate for the scalar maser and the random nature of the maser radiation
field are derived from basic physical principles. Comparision with the standard
radiation transfer equation allows us to examine the underlying assumptions
involved in the current theory of astronomical masers. Simulations are carried
out to follow the amplification of different realisations of the broadband
background radiation by the maser. The observable quantities such as intensity,
spectral line profile are obtained by averaging over an ensemble of the
emerging radiation corresponding to the amplified background radiation field.
Our simulations show that the fluctuations of the radiation field inside the
astronomical maser deviates significantly from Gaussian statistics even when
the maser is only partially saturated. Coupling between different frequency
modes and the population pulsing are shown to have increasing importance in the
transport of maser radiation as the maser approaches saturation. Our results
suggest that the standard formulation of radiation transfer provides a
satisfactory description of the intensity and the line narrowing effect in the
unsaturated and partially saturated masers within the framework of
one-dimensional model. Howerver, the application of the same formulation to the
strong saturation regime should be considered with caution.

The amplification of different realisations of the background continuum
radition by the maser is directly simulated and the Stokes parameters of the
radiation field are then obtained by averaging over the ensemble of emerging
maser radiation. For isotropic pumping and partially saturated masers we find
that the maser radiation is linearly polarized in two representative cases
where the magnetic field {\bf B} makes an angle $\theta$=30$^0$ and
$\theta$=90$^0$ to the maser axis. The linear polarization for maser radiation
obtained in our simulations for both cases are in agreement with the results of
the standard model. Furthermore, no instability during amplification is seen in
our simulations. Therefore, we conclude that there is no problem with the

microturbulent velocities of \xi ~2--4 km/s with a peak at T_eff ~ 8000 K

~0.3--0.6 dex than more reliable [Na/H]_{61} (derived from weak Na I 6154/6161

Consistency with holomorphy requirements of supergravity and the
Kaplunovsky-Louis formula implies that the unification scale is enhanced by the
bulk radius R from the string scale to M_X =RM_S. We argue that the stringy
interpretation of this is via a locally uncancelled tadpole sourced by the
hypercharge flux. This sources closed string modes propagating into the bulk;
equivalently open string gauge coupling running up to the winding scale M_X.
The enhancement to R M_s is tied to GUT breaking by a globally trivial
hypercharge flux and will occur in all models realising this mechanism.

same engine is sometimes used on several aircrafts has to be taken into account
too. The maintenance can be improved if an efficient procedure for the

health of the engines comes from measurement during flights. Several variables

measured, together with environmental variables such as the outside

design of a procedure aiming at visualizing successive data measured on

trajectories of these data over time. The trajectories consist in a succession

which given a graph $G$, one aims to find a cut of minimum size such that both
the sides of the cut have at least $cn$ vertices. In this paper, we present new
directions of progress in the {\sc $c$-Balanced Separator} problem. More
specifically, we propose a new family of mathematical programs, which depends
upon a parameter $\epsilon > 0$, and extend the seminal work of
Arora-Rao-Vazirani ({\sf ARV}) \cite{ARV} to show that the polynomial time
solvability of the proposed family of programs implies an improvement in the
approximation factor to $O(\log^{{1/3} + \epsilon} n)$ from the best-known
factor of $O(\sqrt{\log n})$ due to {\sf ARV}. In fact, for $\epsilon = 1/3$,
the program we get is the SDP proposed by {\sf ARV}. For $\epsilon < 1/3$, this
family of programs is not convex but one can transform them into so called
\emph{\textbf{concave programs}} in which one optimizes a concave function over
a convex feasible set. The properties of concave programs allows one to apply
techniques due to Hoffman \cite{H81} or Tuy \emph{et al} \cite{TTT85} to solve
such problems with arbitrary accuracy. But the problem of finding of a method
to solve these programs that converges in polynomial time still remains open.
Our result, although conditional, introduces a new family of programs which is
more powerful than semi-definite programming in the context of approximation
algorithms and hence it will of interest to investigate this family both in the
direction of designing efficient algorithms and proving hardness results.

range from grand design spirals and interacting galaxies to blue compacts and
tidal dwarfs or isolated extragalactic HII regions, spanning a range of
magnitudes of -21 <= MB <= -12.5 mag. A comparison with the clusters Coma and
A1367 and a sample of field galaxies has shown the presence of cluster galaxies
with L(Halpha) lower than expected for their MB, a consecuence of the cluster
environment. This fact results in differences in the
  L(Halpha) vs. EW(Halpha) and L(H\alpha) distributions of the clusters with

completion of an amalgam of rank two (Levi) subgroups, as they are arranged

over a given diagram to be an amalgam of groups such that the sub-amalgam
corresponding to a two-vertex sub-diagram is the Curtis-Tits amalgam of some
rank-$2$ group of Lie type. There is no a priori reference to an ambient group,
nor to the existence of an associated (twin-) building. Indeed, there is no a

of using Goldschmidt's lemma, we introduce a new approach by applying Bass and
Serre's theory of graphs of groups. The classification reveals a natural
division into two main types: ""orientable"" and ""non-orientable"" Curtis-Tits
structures. Our classification of orientable Curtis-Tits structures naturally
fits with the classification of all locally split Kac-Moody groups using
Moufang foundations. In particular, our classification yields a simple
criterion for recognizing when Curtis-Tits structures give rise to Kac-Moody
groups. The class of non-orientable Curtis-Tits structures is in some sense
much larger. Many of these amalgams turn out to have non-trivial interesting
completions inviting further study.

(`stirring'), so that planetesimal collisions release large quantities of dust.
We investigate the effects of the secular perturbations of a planet, which may
lie at a significant distance from the planetesimal disc, to see if these
perturbations can stir the disc, and if so over what time-scale. The secular
perturbations cause orbits at different semi-major axes to precess at different
rates, and after some time t_cross initially non-intersecting orbits begin to
cross. We show that t_cross is proportional to a_disc^(9/2)/(m_pl e_pl a_pl^3),
where m_pl, e_pl and a_pl are the mass, eccentricity, and semi-major axis of
the planet, and a_disc is the semi-major axis of the disc. This time-scale can
be faster than that for the growth of planetesimals to Pluto's size within the
outer disc. We also calculate the magnitude of the relative velocities induced
amongst planetesimals and infer that a planet's perturbations can typically
cause destructive collisions out to 100's of AU. Recently formed planets can
thus have a significant impact on planet formation in the outer disc which may
be curtailed by the formation of giant planets much closer to the star. The
presence of an observed debris disc does not require the presence of
Pluto-sized objects within it, since it can also have been stirred by a planet
not in the disc. For the star epsilon Eridani, we find that the known RV planet
can excite the planetesimal belt at 60 AU sufficiently to cause destructive
collisions of bodies up to 100 km in size, on a time-scale of 40 Myr.

determined by requiring that, in the atomization limit, the atoms are described
by Hartree-Fock Slater determinants with Jastrow correlations. The energetics,
as well as other physical and chemical properties, are then given by an
efficient variational approach based on standard quantum Monte Carlo
techniques. We test this method on a set of homonuclear (Be2, B2, C2, N2, O2,

efficient turbulent transport of angular momentum in an accretion disk through
a turbulent viscosity effect. It is believed that the same process could also
transport large-scale magnetic fields in disks, reshaping the magnetic
structures in these objects. This process, known as turbulent resistivity, has
been suggested and used in several accretion-ejection models and simulations to
produce jets. Still, the efficiency of MRI-driven turbulence to transport
large-scale magnetic fields is largely unknown.
  We investigate this problem both analytically and numerically. We introduce a
linear calculation of the MRI in the presence of a spatially inhomogeneous mean
magnetic field. We show that, in this configuration, MRI modes lead to an
efficient magnetic field transport, on the order of the angular momentum
transport. We next use fully non linear simulations of MRI turbulence to
compute the turbulent resistivity in several magnetic configurations.
  We find that the turbulent resistivity is on the order of the turbulent
viscosity in all our simulations, although somewhat lower. The turbulent
resistivity tensor is found to be highly anisotropic with a diffusion
coefficient 3 times greater in the radial direction than in the vertical
direction.
  These results support the possibility of driving jets from turbulent disks;
the resulting jets may not be steady.

This QCP is the elementary level of consciousness in quantum particles, which
are the most elementary particles in nature. Thus QCP can explain both the
perceptible and non-perceptible nature and some existing postulates of physics.
We conceptualize that the level of human consciousness is most complex having
highest fractal dimension of 4.85 in the electroencephalographs experiment done
by other research groups. On the other hand, other species are having lesser
consciousness level, which can be reflected by lesser fractal dimensions. We
have also explored the bio informatics of consciousness from genome viewpoints
where we tried to draw an analogy of neurons with electrons and photons.
Lastly, we refine the quantum mechanics in terms of QCP; we all know that in
Einstein's special theory of relativity, Einstein has used the postulate
""Consistency of the velocity of light irrespective of all frames of reference
(inertial or non-inertial frames)"". In our theoretical revelation QCP can be
directly applied to get a confirmatory proof of this postulate. Thus the
postulate can be framed as a law.

Assuming SU(3) flavor symmetry those contact terms and the couplings of the

of the S=-1 hyperon-nucleon channels. Specifically, the values of the pertinent
five low-energy constants related to the contact terms are already fixed from

diffusion and advection (stretching), are competing effects for dynamo action,
plasma resistivity term is shown to be proportional to loops Riemann curvature

broader torus channel produces a better dynamo. These results agree with
Schekochihin et al [Phys Rev \textbf{E} (2002)] where random filamentary
magnetic fields are strengthen by curvature. Analysis of spectrum of chaotic
fast dynamos, shows that Riemann curvature acts as a damping, since growth
magnetic field rate is inversely proportional to Riemann curvature. Comparison
with general relativistic MHD dynamo equation, shows that the Ricci tensor,
which is a contraction of the Riemann tensor also appears in the diffusion
term. Curvature of plasma loop is
${{R^{1}}_{212}}|_{\textbf{Plasma}}\approx{5.6{\times}10^{-19}m^{-2}}$, while

laboratories rather than in plasma loops. It is shown that the

minimum twist energy ${\epsilon}_{\textbf{twist}}\approx{10^{30}TeV}$ stored in
flux ropes. Torus flux tubes around black-holes remain in the order of $2MeV$

interacting via either an Ising- or an XY-type coupling term to subsets of bath
spins of differing size. The large degree of symmetry of the bath allows us to
find parameter regimes where the initial qubit state is revived at well defined
times after the qubit preparation. These times may become independent of the
bath size for large baths and thus enable faithful qubit storage even in the
presence of strong coupling to a bath. We analyze a large range of parameters
and identify those which are best suited for quantum memories. In general we
find that a small number of links between qubit and bath spins leads to less
decoherence and that systems with Ising coupling between qubit and bath spins
