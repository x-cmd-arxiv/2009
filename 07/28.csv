(DM) scenarios are still by and large unavailable. In this note, we study the
potential astrophysical signatures of a new class of hidden sector decaying DM
models, which can address the recent cosmic ray measurements. Such models may
produce primary photons and/or neutrinos at large rates, correlated with the
leptonic production. The photon and neutrino spectra will then contain sharp
features at the TeV scale. We demonstrate the discovery potential for upcoming
and future measurements by FERMI, HESS, AGIS and IceCube/DeepCore. We show that
these models may be discovered in the near future. Specifically, measurements
of diffuse gamma rays by FERMI can detect the start of a hard photon feature.
We argue that these hard spectra can be produced by decaying dark matter and be
consistent with current constraints, but are difficult to reconcile with models
of annihilating DM. Consequently the measurement of a hard spectral feature, in
correlation with the current cosmic ray measurements, will strongly favor
decaying DM models. Finally we comment on the preliminary results from the
Inner Galaxy presented by the FERMI collaboration.

observable lensing statistics. We present the formalism to calculate observable
effects due to a distribution of halos of different masses at different
redshifts along the l ine of sight. We calculate the effects of magnification
on the number counts of high-redshift galaxies. Using BLAST survey data for
submillimeter galaxies (SMGs), we find that magnification affects the steep,
high flux par t of the counts by about 60%. The effect becomes much stronger if
the intrinsic distribution is signi ficantly steeper than observed. We also
consider the effect of this high-redshift galaxy population on contaminating
the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) signal of massive clusters using the halo model
approach. We find that for the majority of clusters expected to be detected
with ongoing SZ surveys, there is significant contamination from the Poisson
noise due to background SMGs. This contr ibution can be comparable to the SZ
increment for typical clusters and can also contaminate the SZ decrement of low
mass clusters. Thus SZ observations, especially for the increment part of the
SZ spectrum, need to include careful modeling of this irreducible contamination
for mass estimation. Lensing further enhances the contamination, especially
close to the cores of massive clusters and for very disturbed clusters with
large magnification cross-section.

We restrict this analysis to the case of a planet on a circular orbit, and we
assume a steady flow in the corotating frame. We also assume that the
corotational flow upstream of the U-turns is unperturbed, so that we discard
saturation effects. In addition to the classical expression for the horseshoe
drag in barotropic disks, which features the vortensity gradient across
corotation, we find an additional term which scales with the entropy gradient,
and whose amplitude depends on the perturbed pressure at the stagnation point
of the horseshoe separatrices. This additional torque is exerted by evanescent
waves launched at the horseshoe separatrices, as a consequence of an asymmetry
of the horseshoe region. It has a steep dependence on the potential's softening
length, suggesting that the effect can be extremely strong in the three
dimensional case. We describe the main properties of the coorbital region (the
production of vortensity during the U-turns, the appearance of vorticity sheets
at the downstream separatrices, and the pressure response), and we give torque
expressions suitable to this regime of migration. Side results include a weak,
negative feed back on migration, due to the dependence of the location of the

an isothermal gaseous disk. In the globally isothermal case, we use a formal-
ism, based on the use of a Bernoulli invariant, that takes into account
pressure effects, and that extends the torque estimate to a region wider than
the horse- shoe region. We find a result that is strictly identical to the
standard horseshoe drag. This shows that the horseshoe drag accounts for the
torque of the whole corotation region, and not only of the horseshoe region,
thereby deserving to be called corotation torque. We find that evanescent waves
launched downstream of the horseshoe U-turns by the perturbations of vortensity
exert a feed-back on the upstream region, that render the horseshoe region
asymmetric. This asymmetry scales with the vortensity gradient and with the
disk's aspect ratio. It does not depend on the planetary mass, and it does not
have any impact on the horseshoe drag. Since the horseshoe drag has a steep
dependence on the width of the horseshoe region, we provide an adequate
definition of the width that needs to be used in horseshoe drag estimates. We
then consider the case of locally isothermal disks, in which the tempera- ture
is constant in time but depends on the distance to the star. The horseshoe drag
appears to be different from the case of a globally isothermal disk. The
difference, which is due to the driving of vortensity in the vicinity of the
planet, is intimately linked to the topology of the flow. We provide a
descriptive inter- pretation of these effects, as well as a crude estimate of
the dependency of the excess on the temperature gradient.

known that G45.45+0.06 is embedded in a complex of UCHII regions, but up the
date, the surrounding ISM in a larger spatial scale has not been analyzed.
Using data from large-scale surveys: Two Micron All Sky Survey, GLIMPSE,
MIPSGAL, MAGPIS and GRS, we performed a multiwavelength study of a region about
7' x 7'in the vicinity of G45.45+0.06. We found that the UCHII complex lies in
a border of a larger (diameter of ~ 3') and fainter HII region, which is
located at the same distance as G45.45+0.06, ~ 8 kpc. In this work, this larger
HII region was called G45L. A good morphological correlation is observed
between the PDRs and the molecular gas mapped in the 13CO J=1--0 and CS J=2--1
lines, suggesting that G45L may be collecting the molecular material. From a
near- and mid-IR photometric study, we found three sources, likely O-type
stars, that are possibly responsible for the creation of G45L. Additionally we
found several YSO candidates lying preferently in the molecular shell that
surrounds G45L. Our results confirm that the region southeastern the UCHII
complex where G45.45+0.06 is embedded and eastern G45L is active in star
formation. We suggest that G45L has been expanding during about 2 x 10^6 yr and
could have triggered the formation of the zero-age main sequence stars that are
ionizing the UCHII region G45.45+0.06. However we can not discard that both HII
regions are coeval.

While the homogeneous flow is found to be stable far from the transition line,
it becomes unstable with respect to finite-wavelength perturbations close to
the transition, implying a non trivial spatio-temporal structure for the

thanks to their ability to provide an accelerated cosmic expansion in a matter

f(R) must meet the local tests of gravity and the constraints from the
primordial abundance of the light elements. Two popular classes of f(R) models,
which are expected to fulfill all the above requirements, have recently been
proposed. However, neither of these models has ever been quantitatively tested
against the available astrophysical data. Here, by combining Type Ia Supernovae

the observed Hubble diagram over the redshift range (0, 7). We find that both
models fit very well this dataset with the present day values of the matter
density and deceleration parameters which agree with previous estimates.
However, the strong degeneracy among the f(R) parameters prevents us from
putting strong constraints on the values of these parameters; nevertheless, we
can identify the regions of the parameter space that should, in principle, be
carefully explored with future data and dynamical probes in order to
discriminate among f(R) theories and standard dark energy models.

(MMSE) for Gaussian samples. Specifically, we consider shrinkage methods which
are suitable for high dimensional problems with a small number of samples
(large p small n). First, we improve on the Ledoit-Wolf (LW) method by
conditioning on a sufficient statistic. By the Rao-Blackwell theorem, this
yields a new estimator called RBLW, whose mean-squared error dominates that of
LW for Gaussian variables. Second, to further reduce the estimation error, we
propose an iterative approach which approximates the clairvoyant shrinkage
estimator. Convergence of this iterative method is established and a closed
form expression for the limit is determined, which is referred to as the oracle
approximating shrinkage (OAS) estimator. Both RBLW and OAS estimators have
simple expressions and are easily implemented. Although the two methods are
developed from different persepctives, their structure is identical up to
specified constants. The RBLW estimator provably dominates the LW method.
Numerical simulations demonstrate that the OAS approach can perform even better
than RBLW, especially when n is much less than p. We also demonstrate the
performance of these techniques in the context of adaptive beamforming.

We present a full quantum-mechanical treatment of this force and identify a
generalised Doppler effect, the time delay between photon emission and
reabsorption, and the Roentgen interaction as its three sources. For
ground-state atoms, the force is very small and always decelerating, hence
commonly known as quantum friction. For atom and molecules in electronically
excited states, on the contrary, both decelerating and accelerating forces can
occur depending on the magnitude of the atomic transition frequency relative to
the surface plasmon frequency.

form a sparse vector in the angle space, and therefore, compressive sampling
can be applied for DOA estimation. The proposed approach achieves the superior

particularly useful in a distributed scenario, in which the results at each

unification, but where the requirement of universal soft terms at the GUT scale
is relaxed. We consider the scenario in which the breaking of universality
inherits from the Yukawa couplings, i.e. is of minimal flavor violating (MFV)
type. In particular, the MFV principle allows for a splitting between the
up-type and the down-type soft trilinear couplings.
  We explore the viability of this trilinear splitting scenario by means of a
fitting procedure to electroweak observables, quark masses as well as
flavor-changing neutral current processes. Phenomenological viability singles
out one main scenario. This scenario is characterized by a sizable splitting
between the trilinear soft terms and a large mu term. Remarkably, this scenario
does not invoke a partial decoupling of the sparticle spectrum, as in the case
of universal soft terms, but instead it requires part of the spectrum, notably
the lightest stop, the gluino and the lightest charginos and neutralinos to be
very close to the current experimental limits. The above mechanism is mostly
triggered by a non-trivial interplay between the requirements of negative,
sizable SUSY threshold corrections to mb and an instead negligible modification
of the B --> Xs gamma decay rate, in presence of various other constraints,
most notably a successful EWSB and a not too large BR(Bs --> mu^+ mu^-).
  We present a model-building interpretation of our discussed scenario and
emphasize the crucial role of SUSY spectrum determinations at the LHC for
either falsifying Yukawa unification or else providing important hints on the
mechanism of SUSY breaking at work.

g-r and r-i colors are used to determine whether Ultraluminous X-ray sources
(ULXs) are predominantly associated with star-forming regions of their host
galaxies. An empirical selection criterion is derived from colors of HII
regions in M81 and M101 that differentiates between the young, blue stellar
component and the older disk and bulge population. This criterion is applied to
a sample of 58 galaxies of Hubble type S0 and later and verified through an
application of Fisher's linear discriminant analysis. It is found that 60%
(49%) of ULXs in optically-bright environments are within regions blueward of
their host galaxy's HII regions compared to only 27% (0%) of a control sample
according to the empirical (Fisher) criterion. This is an excess of 3-sigma
above the 32% (27%) expected if the ULXs were randomly distributed within their
galactic hosts. This indicates a ULX preference for young, approximately <10
Myr, OB associations. However, none of the ULX environments have the morphology
and optical brightness suggestive of a massive young super star cluster though
several are in extended or crowded star-forming (blue) environments that may
contain clusters unresolved by Sloan imaging. Ten of the 12 ULX candidates with
estimated X-ray luminosities in excess of 3e39 erg/s are equally divided among
the group of ULX environments redward of HII regions and the group of optically
faint regions. This likely indicates that the brightest ULXs turn on at a time
somewhat later than typical of HII regions; say 10-20 Myr after star formation
has ended. This would be consistent with the onset of an accretion phase as the
donor star ascends the giant branch if the donor is a <20 solar-mass star.

driven by the spin blockade mechanism of diffusive free radicals against
ionizing radiation.
  {\bf Materials and methods}: We theoretically propose a mechanism which uses
the simultaneous application of circularly polarized light and an external
magnetic field to control the polarization of the free radicals and create S=1
electron-hole spin excitations (excitons) on nucleotide-base. We deploy an
ab-initio molecular dynamics model to calculate the characteristic parameters
of the light needed for optical transitions.
  {\bf Results}: As a specific example, we present the numerical results
calculated for a Guanine, in the presence of an OH free radical. To increase
the radio-resistivity of this system, a blue light source for the optical
pumping and induction of excitons on guanine can be used.
  {\bf Conclusions}: The effect of spin-injection on the formation of a free
energy barrier in diffusion controlled chemical reaction pathways leads to the
control of radiation-induced base damage. The proposed method allows us to
manipulate and partially suppress the damage induced by ionizing radiation.

are presented for the 258 galaxies in the Local Volume Legacy (LVL). LVL is a
Spitzer Space Telescope legacy program that surveys the local universe out to
11 Mpc, built upon a foundation of ultraviolet, H-alpha, and HST imaging from
11HUGS (11 Mpc H-alpha and Ultraviolet Galaxy Survey) and ANGST (ACS Nearby
Galaxy Survey Treasury). LVL covers an unbiased, representative, and
statistically robust sample of nearby star-forming galaxies, exploiting the
highest extragalactic spatial resolution achievable with Spitzer. As a result
of its approximately volume-limited nature, LVL augments previous Spitzer
observations of present-day galaxies with improved sampling of the
low-luminosity galaxy population. The collection of LVL galaxies shows a large
spread in mid-infrared colors, likely due to the conspicuous deficiency of 8um
PAH emission from low-metallicity, low-luminosity galaxies. Conversely, the
far-infrared emission tightly tracks the total infrared emission, with a
dispersion in their flux ratio of only 0.1 dex. In terms of the relation
between infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio and ultraviolet spectral slope, the LVL
sample shows redder colors and/or lower infrared-to-ultraviolet ratios than
starburst galaxies, suggesting that reprocessing by dust is less important in
the lower mass systems that dominate the LVL sample. Comparisons with
theoretical models suggest that the amplitude of deviations from the relation
found for starburst galaxies correlates with the age of the stellar populations
that dominate the ultraviolet/optical luminosities.

in the rate function of either the time-averaged entropy production or heat
dissipation of a process. Such theorems have been proved for various general
classes of continuous-time deterministic and stochastic processes, but always
under the assumption that the forces driving the system are time independent,
and often relying on the existence of a limiting ergodic distribution. In this
paper we extend the asymptotic fluctuation theorem for the first time to
inhomogeneous continuous-time processes without a stationary distribution,
considering specifically a finite state Markov chain driven by periodic
transition rates. We find that for both entropy production and heat
dissipation, the usual Gallavotti-Cohen symmetry of the rate function is
generalized to an analogous relation between the rate functions of the original
process and its corresponding backward process, in which the trajectory and the
driving protocol have been time-reversed. The effect is that spontaneous
positive fluctuations in the long time average of each quantity in the forward
process are exponentially more likely than spontaneous negative fluctuations in
the backward process, and vice-versa, revealing that the distributions of
fluctuations in universes in which time moves forward and backward are related.
As an additional result, the asymptotic time-averaged entropy production is
obtained as the integral of a periodic entropy production rate that generalizes
the constant rate pertaining to homogeneous dynamics.

weakening of the higher ionization relative to the lower ionization X-ray lines
with advancing spectral type, and the similarly decreasing intensity ratios of

predicted by models, nor have they been clearly evident in astrophysical
studies of a few objects; rather, they have emerged from morphological analysis
of an adequate (albeit still small) sample, from which known peculiar objects

normal trends. This process is analogous to that which first demonstrated the
strong relationships between the UV wind profiles and the optical spectral
types of normal OB stars, which likely bear a physical as well as a historical
connection to the present X-ray results. Since the optical spectral types are
calibrated in terms of fundamental stellar parameters, it follows that the
winds and X-ray spectra are determined by the latter. These observations
provide strong guidance for further astrophysical modeling of these phenomena.

the properties of rapidity dependence of particle production in heavy ion

properties of the system formed at high rapidity resemble that of systems at

the demonstration that high-\pT suppression is a final state effect. Another

devices, the channel has to be bootstrapped first. To prevent any malicious
control of or eavesdropping over the communication, the channel is desired to
be authenticated and confidential. The process of setting up a secure
communication channel between two previously unassociated devices is referred
to as ""Secure Device Pairing"". When there is no prior security context, e.g.,
shared secrets, common key servers or public key certificates, device pairing
requires user involvement into the process. The idea usually involves
leveraging an auxiliary human-perceptible channel to authenticate the data
exchanged over the insecure wireless channel.
  We observe that the focus of prior research has mostly been limited to
pairing scenarios where a single user controls both the devices. In this paper,
we consider more general and emerging ""two-user"" scenarios, where two different
users establish pairing between their respective devices. Although a number of
pairing methods exists in the literature, only a handful of those are
applicable to the two-user setting. We present the first study to identify the
methods practical for two-user pairing scenarios, and comparatively evaluate
the usability of these methods. Our results identify methods best-suited for
users, in terms of efficiency, error-tolerance and of course, usability. Our
work sheds light on the applicability and usability of pairing methods for
emerging two-user scenarios, a topic largely ignored so far.

the behaviour of dark energy at those epochs. This unique sample significantly
extends previous catalogs to higher redshifts while retaining high efficiency

improvement compared to the obtained constraints from other cosmological

contexts, including extragalactic jets and pulsar-wind nebulae (PWNe). For
X-ray synchrotron emission, flow times are often longer than electron radiative
lifetimes, so the effective source size at a given X-ray energy is the distance
electrons radiating at that energy can convect before they burn off. Since
synchrotron losses vary strongly with electron energy, the source size drops
with increasing X-ray energy, resulting in a steepening of the synchrotron
spectrum. For homogeneous sources, this burnoff produces the well-known result
of a steepening by 0.5 in the source's integrated spectral index. However, for
inhomogeneous sources, different amounts of steepening are possible. I exhibit
a simple phenomenological picture of an outflow of relativistic electrons with
bulk nonrelativistic flow speed, with transverse flow-tube radius,
magnetic-field strength, matter density, and flow velocity all varying as
different powers of distance from the injection point. For such a picture, I
calculate the value of the spectral index above the break as a function of the
power-law indices, and show the possible range of steepenings. I show that
these simple calculations are confirmed by full integrations of source
luminosity, which also include the spectral ""bump"" below the break from the
accumulation of electrons formerly at higher energies. In many cases,
extragalactic jets show X-ray synchrotron emission steeper by more than 0.5
than the radio emission; the same phenomenon is exhibited by many pulsar-wind
nebulae. It is possible that source inhomogeneities are responsible in at least
some cases, so that the amount of spectral steepening becomes a diagnostic for
source dynamical or geometrical properties.

dimensional (2D) simulations, we investigate the matter gravitational-wave (GW)
emission from postbounce phases of neutrino-driven core-collapse supernovae
(CCSNe). The relevant phases are prompt and steady-state convection, the
standing accretion shock instability (SASI), and asymmetric explosions. For the
stages before explosion, we propose a model for the source of GW emission.
Downdrafts of the postshock-convection/SASI region strike the protoneutron star
""surface"" with large speeds and are decelerated by buoyancy forces. We find
that the GW amplitude is set by the magnitude of deceleration and, by
extension, the downdraft's speed and the vigor of postshock-convective/SASI
motions. However, the characteristic frequencies, which evolve from ~100 Hz
after bounce to ~300-400 Hz, are primarily independent of these speeds, but are
set by the deceleration timescale, which is in turn set by the buoyancy
frequency at the lower boundary of postshock convection. Consequently, the GW
characteristic frequencies are dependent upon a combination of core structure
attributes, specifically the dense-matter equation of state (EOS) and details
that determine the gradients at the boundary, including the accretion-rate
history, the EOS at subnuclear densities, and neutrino transport. During
explosion, the high frequency signal wanes and is replaced by a strong low
frequency, ~10s of Hz, signal that reveals the general morphology of the
explosion (i.e. prolate, oblate, or spherical). However, current and
near-future GW detectors are sensitive to GW power at frequencies >50 Hz.
Therefore, the signature of explosion will be the abrupt reduction of
detectable GW emission.

incompleteness is a concern for such compact galaxies, particularly for low
redshifts (z < ~0.05) as a result of the SDSS spectroscopic target selection

0.12 that are smaller than the median size-mass relation by a factor of 2 or
more. Consistent with expectations from the virial theorem, the median offset
from the mass-velocity dispersion relation for these galaxies is 0.12 dex. We
do not find any galaxies with sizes and masses comparable to those observed at
z ~ 2, implying a decrease in the comoving number density (at fixed size and
mass) by a factor of > 5000. This result cannot be explained by incompleteness:
at 0.066 < z <0.12, the SDSS spectroscopic sample should typically be ~75%
complete for galaxies with the sizes and masses seen at high redshift, although
for the very smallest galaxies it may be as low as ~20%. To confirm that the
absence of such compact massive galaxies in SDSS is not a spectroscopic
selection effect, we have also looked for such galaxies in the SDSS photometric
catalog, using photometric redshifts. While we do find signs of a bias against
massive, compact galaxies, this analysis suggests that the SDSS spectroscopic
sample is missing at most a few objects in the regime we consider. Accepting
the high redshift results, it is clear that massive galaxies must undergo
significant structural evolution over z<2 in order to match the population seen
in the local universe. Our results suggest that a highly stochastic mechanism
like major mergers cannot be the primary driver of this strong size evolution.

  The derivative types of the clusters - obelisks (or truncated wedges) and
accreted wedges - have been revealed and investigated for the first time, they

originate from the wedges as a result of their height limitation and further

applied to obtaining asymptotic variance estimates, which are a useful measure

Mo, Mao, White (1998) (MMW) model requires unusually large disk spin parameters
lambda_d>0.1 and disk-to-dark halo mass fraction m_d=0.2, close to the cosmic
baryon fraction. The galaxies segregate into dispersion-dominated systems with
1<vmax/sigma<3, maximum rotational velocities vmax<200 km/s and disk half-light
radii rd=1-3 kpc and rotation-dominated systems with vmax>200 km/s,
vmax/sigma>3 and rd=4-8 kpc. For the dispersion-dominated sample, radial
pressure gradients partly compensate the gravitational force, reducing the
rotational velocities. Including this pressure effect in the MMW model,
dispersion-dominated galaxies can be fitted well with spin parameters lf
lambda_d=0.03-0.05 for high disk mass fractions of m_d=0.2 and with
lambda_d=0.01-0.03 for m_d=0.05. These values are in good agreement with
cosmological expectations. For the rotation-dominated sample however pressure
effects are small and better agreement with theoretically expected disk spin
parameters can only be achieved if the dark halo mass contribution in the
visible disk regime (2-3*rd) is smaller than predicted by the MMW model. We
argue that these galaxies can still be embedded in standard cold dark matter
halos if the halos did not contract adiabatically in response to disk
formation. It is shown that the observed high turbulent gas motions of the
galaxies are consistent with a Toomre instability parameter Q=1 which is equal
to the critical value, expected for gravitational disk instability to be the
major driver of turbulence. The dominant energy source of turbulence is then
the potential energy of the gas in the disk.

in which heteronuclear molecules are created via an interspecies Feshbach
resonance involving either two-species Bose or two-species Fermi atoms at zero
temperature. We show that the resonant two-channel Bose model is equivalent to
the nondegenerate parametric down-conversion in quantum optics, while the
corresponding Fermi model can be mapped to a quantum optics model that
describes a single-mode laser field interacting with an ensemble of
inhomogeneously broadened two-level atoms. Using these analogy and the fact
that both models are subject to the Kerr nonlinearity due to the two-body
s-wave collisions, we show that under proper conditions, the population in the
molecular state in both models can be made to change with the Feshbach detuning
in a bistable fashion.

selected from a sample of 57 low-redshift Abell clusters. We utilize the
non-parametric dwarf-to-giant ratio (DGR) and the blue galaxy fraction (fb) to
investigate the clustercentric radial-dependent changes in the cluster galaxy
population. Composite cluster samples are combined by scaling the counting
radius by r200 to minimize radius selection bias. The separation of galaxies
into a red and blue population was achieved by selecting galaxies relative to
the cluster color-magnitude relation. The DGR of the red and blue galaxies is
found to be independent of cluster richness (Bgc), although the DGR is larger
for the blue population at all measured radii. A decrease in the DGR for the
red and red+blue galaxies is detected in the cluster core region, while the
blue galaxy DGR is nearly independent of radius. The fb is found not to
correlate with Bgc; however, a steady decline toward the inner-cluster region
is observed for the giant galaxies. The dwarf galaxy fb is approximately
constant with clustercentric radius except for the inner cluster core region
where fb decreases. The clustercentric radial dependence of the DGR and the
galaxy blue fraction, indicates that it is unlikely that a simple scenario
based on either pure disruption or pure fading/reddening can describe the
evolution of infalling dwarf galaxies; both outcomes are produced by the
cluster environment.

result in capture into the 2:1 eccentricity-type mean-motion resonances. Both
the sequence of 2:1 eccentricity resonances that the system is driven through
by continued migration and the possibility of a subsequent capture into the 4:2
inclination resonances are sensitive to the migration rate within the range
expected for type II migration. If the migration rate is fast, the resonant
pair can evolve into a family of 2:1 eccentricity resonances different from
those found by Lee (2004). This new family has outer orbital eccentricity e_2 >
0.4-0.5, asymmetric librations of both eccentricity resonance variables, and
orbits that intersect if they are exactly coplanar. Although this family exists
for an inner-to-outer planet mass ratio m_1/m_2 > 0.2, it is possible to evolve
into this family by fast migration only for m_1/m_2 > 2. Thommes and Lissauer
(2003) have found that a capture into the 4:2 inclination resonances is
possible only for m_1/m_2 < 2. We show that this capture is also possible for
m_1/m_2 > 2 if the migration rate is slightly slower than that adopted by
Thommes and Lissauer. There is significant theoretical uncertainty in both the
sign and the magnitude of the net effect of planet-disk interaction on the
orbital eccentricity of a planet. If the eccentricity is damped on a timescale
comparable to or shorter than the migration timescale, e_2 may not be able to
reach the values needed to enter either the new 2:1 eccentricity resonances or
the 4:2 inclination resonances. Thus, if future observations of extrasolar
planetary systems were to reveal certain combinations of mass ratio and
resonant configuration, they would place a constraint on the strength of
eccentricity damping during migration, as well as on the migration rate itself.

This model is valid at relatively high Reynolds numbers and low Mach numbers.
The experimental method consists in measuring the acoustical pressure at three
different positions in an impedance tube, the two measurement positions usually
considered in an impedance tube and one measurement in the vicinity of the rear
surface of the MPP. The impedance tube is equipped with a pressure driver
instead of the usual loudspeaker and capable of delivering a high sound
pressure level up to 160 dB. Several MPP specimens made out of steel and
polypropylene were tested. Measurements using random noise or sinusoidal
excitation in a frequency range between 200 and 1600 Hz were carried out on
MPPs backed by air cavities. It was observed that the maximum of absorption can
be a positive or a negative function of the flow velocity in the perforations.
This suggests the existence of a maximum of absorption as a function of flow
velocity. This behavior was predicted by the model and confirmed
experimentally.

Meridian Survey (PGMS), an investigation of the Galactic latitude behaviour of
the polarized synchrotron emission at 2.3 GHz with the Parkes Radio Telescope.
The survey consists of a 5-deg wide strip along the Galactic meridian l=254-deg
extending from Galactic plane to South Galactic pole. We identify three zones
distinguished by polarized emission properties: the disc, the halo, and a
transition region connecting them. The halo section lies at latitudes |b| >
40-deg and has weak and smooth polarized emission mostly at large scale with
steep angular power spectra of median slope $\beta_{\rm med} \sim -2.6$. The
disc region covers the latitudes |b|<20-deg and has a brighter, more complex
emission dominated by the small scales with flatter spectra of median slope
$\beta_{\rm med} = -1.8$. The transition region has steep spectra as in the
halo, but the emission increases toward the Galactic plane from halo to disc
levels. The change of slope and emission structure at $b \sim -20\degr$ is
sudden, indicating a sharp disc-halo transition. The whole halo section is just
one environment extended over 50-deg with very low emission which, once scaled
to 70GHz, is equivalent to the CMB B-Mode emission for a tensor-to-scalar
perturbation power ratio r_halo = 3.3 +/- 0.4 x 10^{-3}. Applying a
conservative cleaning procedure, we estimate an r detection limit of $\delta r
\sim 2\times 10^{-3}$ at 70~GHz (3-sigma C.L.) and, assuming a dust polariztion
fraction <12%, $\delta r \sim 1\times 10^{-2}$ at 150~GHz. The 150-GHz limit
matches the goals of planned sub-orbital experiments, which can therefore be
conducted at this high frequency. The 70-GHz limit is close to the goal of
proposed next generation space missions, which thus might not strictly require
space-based platforms.

certain infrequent alarm events, and to forward alarm packets to a base
station, using geographical forwarding. The nodes know their locations, and
they sleep-wake cycle, waking up periodically but not synchronously. In this
situation, when a node has a packet to forward to the sink, there is a
trade-off between how long this node waits for a suitable neighbor to wake up
and the progress the packet makes towards the sink once it is forwarded to this
neighbr. Hence, in choosing a relay node, we consider the problem of minimizing
average delay subject to a constraint on the average progress. By constraint
relaxation, involving a Lagrange multiplier, we formulate this next hop relay
selection problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). The exact optimal
solution (BF (Best Forward)) can be found, but is computationally intensive.
Next, we consider a mathematically simplified model for which the optimal
policy (SF (Simplified Forward)) turns out to be a simple one-step-look-ahead
rule. Simulations show that SF is very close in performance to BF, even for
reasonably small node density. We then study the end-to-end performance of SF
in comparison with two extremal policies: Max Forward (MF), which makes the
maximum possible progress per hop and thus reduces network energy consumption,
and First Forward (FF), which forwards the packet to the first node to wake up,
and thus tends to make end-to-end forwarding delays small. We find that, with
appropriate choice of one hop average progress constraint, SF can be tuned to
provide a favorable trade-off between end-to-end packet delay and the number of
hops in the forwarding path.

discharged from a flat bottomed silo subjected to vertical vibration. When the
exit orifice is only a few grain diameter wide, the flow can be arrested due to
the formation of blocking arches. Hence, an external excitation is needed to
resume the flow. The use of a continuous gentle vibration is a usual technique
to ease the flow in such situations. Even though jamming is less frequent, it
is still an issue in vibrated silos. There are, in principle, two possible
mechanisms through which vibrations may facilitate the flow: (i) a decrease in
the probability of the formation of blocking arches, and (ii) the breakage of
blocking arches once they have been formed. By measuring the time intervals
inside an avalanche during which no particles flow through the outlet, we are
able to estimate the probability of breaking a blocking arch by vibrations. The
result agrees with the prediction of a bivariate probabilistic model in which
the formation of blocking arches is equally probable in vibrated and
non-vibrated silos. This indicates that the second aforementioned mechanism is
the main responsible for improving the flowability in gently vibrated silos.

parameter $\mathbf{r}$ which varies in the $d$-dimensional real vector space.
They generalize well-known numeration systems such as beta-expansions,
expansions with respect to rational bases, and canonical number systems.
Beta-numeration and canonical number systems are known to be intimately related
to fractal shapes, such as the classical Rauzy fractal and the twin dragon.
These fractals turned out to be important for studying properties of expansions
in several settings. In the present paper we associate a collection of fractal
tiles with shift radix systems. We show that for certain classes of parameters
$\mathbf{r}$ these tiles coincide with affine copies of the well-known tiles
associated with beta-expansions and canonical number systems. On the other
hand, these tiles provide natural families of tiles for beta-expansions with
(non-unit) Pisot numbers as well as canonical number systems with (non-monic)
expanding polynomials. We also prove basic properties for tiles associated with
shift radix systems. Indeed, we prove that under some algebraic conditions on
the parameter $\mathbf{r}$ of the shift radix system, these tiles provide
multiple tilings and even tilings of the $d$-dimensional real vector space.
These tilings turn out to have a more complicated structure than the tilings
arising from the known number systems mentioned above. Such a tiling may
consist of tiles having infinitely many different shapes. Moreover, the tiles
need not be self-affine (or graph directed self-affine).

Our approach promotes peering among providers, while upholding user perceived

predict the user perceived performance. We show that peering between CDNs
upholds user perceived performance by satisfying the target QoS. The
methodology presented in this paper provides CDNs a way to dynamically
distribute user requests to other peers according to different
request-redirection policies. The model-based approach helps an overloaded CDN
to return to a normal state by offloading excess requests to the peers. It also
assists in making concrete QoS guarantee for a CDN provider. Our approach
endeavors to achieve scalability and resource sharing among CDNs through
effective peering in a user transparent manner, thus evolving past the current
landscape where non-cooperative and distinct CDNs exist.

legitimate users can be reliably authenticated and false users can be reliably

disk galaxy having a very bright outer disk. The outer disk of this galaxy
contains ~23% of the total stellar mass budget of the galaxy and contributes
~10% of the new stars created showing that this region of the galaxy is active.
In fact, the specific star formation rate of the outer disk (~0.012 Gyr^{-1})
is a factor of ~2 larger (i.e. the star formation is more efficient per unit
stellar mass) than in the inner disk. We have explored different scenarios to
explain the enhanced star formation in the outer disk. We find that the inner

systems variational equations. An unprecedented large set of initial conditions
are studied to generate the MEGNO maps. The chaotic nature of initial
conditions are demonstrated by studying a quasi-periodic orbit and a chaotic
orbit. As a result we establish the existence of several high-order mean-motion
resonances detected for retrograde orbits along with other interesting
dynamical features. The computed MEGNO maps allows to qualitatively
differentiate between chaotic and quasi-periodic regions of the irregular
satellite phase-space given only a relatively short integration time. By
comparing with previous published results we can establish a correlation
between chaotic regions and corresponding regions of orbital instability.

Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). Our approach benefits from several improvements
with respect to earlier relativistic SPH formulations. It is self-consistently
derived from the Lagrangian of an ideal fluid and accounts for
special-relativistic ""grad-h terms"". In our approach, we evolve the canonical
momentum and the canonical energy per baryon and thus circumvent some of the
problems that have plagued earlier formulations of relativistic SPH. We further
use a much improved artificial viscosity prescription which uses the extreme
local eigenvalues of the Euler equations and triggers selectively on a) shocks
and b) velocity noise. The shock trigger accurately monitors the relative
density slope and uses it to fine-tune the amount of artificial viscosity that
is applied. This procedure substantially sharpens shock fronts while still
avoiding post-shock noise. If not triggered, the viscosity parameter of each
particle decays to zero. None of these viscosity triggers is specific to
special relativity, both could also be applied in Newtonian SPH. The
performance of the new scheme is explored in a large variety of benchmark tests
where it delivers excellent results. Generally, the grad-h terms deliver minor,
though worthwhile, improvements. The scheme performs close to perfect in
supersonic advection tests, but also in strong relativistic shocks, usually
considered a particular challenge for SPH, the method yields convincing
results. For example, due to its perfect conservation properties, it is able to
handle Lorentz-factors as large as $\gamma= 50 \; 000$ in the so-called wall
shock test. Moreover, we find convincing results in a rarely shown, but
challenging test that involves so-called relativistic simple waves and also in
multi-dimensional shock tube tests.

  The X-ray spectrum can be described by thermal bremsstrahlung of temperature
$kT_1=6.89 \pm 0.23$ keV plus a black-body component (upper limit) with
temperature $kT_2=30_{-6}^{+8}$ eV. Neglecting the black-body, the bolometric
absorption corrected flux is $F^{\rm{Bol}}=(6.5\pm 0.1)\times10^{-12}$ erg

size and location of the X-ray emitting region, which turns out to be close to
the white dwarf radius. We measure an X-ray eclipse somewhat smaller (but only

Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality, has been observed for a spin-path
entangled neutron state in an interferometric setup. It is experimentally
demonstrated that the effect of geometric phase can be balanced by a change in
Bell angles. The geometric phase is acquired during a time dependent
interaction with two radio-frequency (rf) fields. Two schemes, polar and
azimuthal adjustment of the Bell angles, are realized and analyzed in detail.
The former scheme, yields a sinusoidal oscillation of the correlation function
S, dependent on the geometric phase, such that it varies in the range between 2
and 2\sqrt{2} and, therefore, always exceeds the boundary value 2 between
quantum mechanic and noncontextual theories. The latter scheme results in a
constant, maximal violation of the Bell-like-CHSH inequality, where S remains
2\sqrt2 for all settings of the geometric phase.

steady state is again seen, indicating that our observation in the full
multistrain model is based on qualitative characteristics of the dynamics
rather than on details of the disease model.

dynamics at the early times immediately following heavy ion collisions. One
approach is based on small-coupling physics of the Color Glass Condensate
(CGC). The other approach is based on Anti-de Sitter space/Conformal Field
Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence and may be applicable to describing
large-coupling QCD interactions. We point out that in terms of theoretical
tools the two approaches are somewhat similar: in CGC one deals with classical
gluon fields produced in a nuclear shock wave collision, while in AdS/CFT one
studies classical gravity in a gravitational shock wave collision. We stress,
however, that the resulting physics is different: the classical gluon fields in
CGC lead to a free-streaming medium produced in heavy ion collisions, while the
classical gravity in the 5-dimensional AdS bulk is likely to lead to ideal
hydrodynamics description of the produced medium. Also, the valence quarks in
colliding nuclei in CGC continue along their light cone trajectories after the
collision with very little recoil, while we show that in AdS the colliding
nuclei are likely to lose most of their energy in the collision and stop.

geometry of two parallel plates on background of Minkowski spacetime with an
arbitrary number of toroidally compactified spatial dimensions. The bag
boundary conditions are imposed on the plates and periodicity conditions with
arbitrary phases are considered along the compact dimensions. The Casimir
energy is decomposed into purely topological, single plate and interaction
parts. With independence of the lengths of the compact dimensions and the
phases in the periodicity conditions, the interaction part of the Casimir
energy is always negative. In order to obtain the resulting force, the
contributions from both sides of the plates must be taken into account. Then,
the forces coming from the topological parts of the vacuum energy cancel out
and only the interaction term contributes to the Casimir force. Applications of
the general formulae to Kaluza-Klein type models and carbon nanotubes are
given. In particular, we show that for finite length metallic nanotubes the
Casimir forces acting on the tube edges are always attractive, whereas for
semiconducting-type ones they are attractive for small lengths of the nanotube
and repulsive for large lengths.

of body anatomy during radiation therapy to reduce the unintentional delivery
of the radiation to sensitive organs. We show that the accurate optimization of
