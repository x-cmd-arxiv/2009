understanding and formulation of constraints which keep the rewiring stochastic
processes within the class of simple graphs. To formulate these constraints a
new concept of wedge distribution (paths of length 2) is introduced and its
relation to degree-degree correlation is studied. The analysis shows that the
constraints, together with edge selection rules, do not even allow to formulate
a closed master equation in the general case. We also introduce a particular
stochastic process which does not contain edge selection rules, but which, we
believe, can provide some insight into the complexities of simple graphs.

holes with contracting horizons is proposed. The method is based on a gedanken
experiment on quantum energy teleportation (QET), which has been recently
proposed in quantum information theory. We consider this QET protocol for N
massless fields in near-horizon regions of large-mass black holes with
near-horizon geometry described by the Minkowski metric. For each field, a
two-level spin is strongly coupled with the local quantum fluctuation outside
the horizon during a short time period. After the measurement of N fields,
N-bit information is obtained. During the measurement, positive-energy wave
packets of the fields form and then fall into the black hole. The amount of
excitation energy is independent of the measurement result. After absorption of
the wave packets and increase of the black hole mass, a
measurement-result-dependent local operation of the N fields is performed
outside the horizon. Then, accompanying the extraction of positive energy from
the quantum fluctuation by the operation, negative-energy wave packets of the
fields form and then fall into the black hole, decreasing the black hole mass.
This implies that a part of the absorbed positive energy emitted from the
measurement devices is effectively retrieved from the black hole via the
measurement results.

higher dimensional gravity with quadratic in curvature terms. Such terms
naturally arise as a result of quantum corrections induced by quantum fields
propagating in the gravitational background. We focus our attention on the
correction of the form ${\cal C}^2=C_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}
C^{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}$. The Gauss-Bonnet equation in four-dimensional
(4D) spacetime enables one to reduce this term in the action to the terms
quadratic in the Ricci tensor and scalar curvature. As a result the
Schwarzschild solution which is Ricci flat will be also a solution of the
theory with the Weyl scalar ${\cal C}^2$ correction. An important new feature
of the spaces with dimension $D > 4$ is that in the presence of the Weyl
curvature-squared term a solution necessary differs from the corresponding
`classical' vacuum Tangherlini metric. This difference is related to the
presence of {\em secondary} or {\em induced} hair. We explore how the
Tangherlini solution is modified by `quantum corrections', assuming that the
gravitational radius $r_0$ is much larger than the scale of the quantum
corrections. We also demonstrated that finding a general solution beyond the

equation).

legitimate frame work of science. Our reasoning is quite distinct from the
erstwhile doctrine of the role of consciousness in the measurement problem and
state vector reduction although the latter may add further credence to the our
contention. We address particularly the implications NL and discuss certain

the amplitude of X-ray variability. We suggest that accelerated particles
striking material could be linking X-ray and optical variability (as in
activity in the solar chromosphere). Beaming effects could be significant in
all types of AGN. The diversity in optical/X-ray relationships at different
times in the same object, and between different objects, might be explained by
changes in geometry and directions of motion relative to our line of sight.
Linear shot-noise models of the variability are ruled out; instead there must
be large-scale organization of variability. Variability occurs on
light-crossing timescales rather than viscous timescales and this probably
rules out the standard Shakura-Sunyaev accretion disk. Radio-loud and
radio-quiet AGNs have similar continuum shapes and similar variability
properties. This suggests similar continuum origins and variability mechanisms.
Despite their extreme X-ray variability, narrow-line Seyfert 1s (NLS1s) do not

filaments extending more than ~3 kpc above and below the galactic plane of M82,
roughly coincident with the well-known galactic wind in this system.
Comparisons of these data with published results at other wavelengths provide
quantitative constraints on the topology, excitation, heating, and stability
against disruption of the wind-entrained molecular ISM in this prototypical
galactic wind. Deep H_2 2.12 um observations such as these represent a
promising new method to study the elusive but potentially important molecular
component of galactic winds.

directly study and infer the nature of its magnetic field. Methods: We used the
new generation spectropolarimeters ESPaDOnS and NARVAL to observe and detect
circular polarization within the photospheric absorption lines of Pollux. Our
observations span 18 months from 2007-2009. We treated the spectropolarimetric
data using the Least-Squares Deconvolution method to create high
signal-to-noise ratio mean Stokes V profiles. We also measured the classical
activity indicator S-index for the Ca H&K lines, and the stellar radial
velocity (RV). Results: We have unambiguously detected a weak Stokes V signal
in the spectral lines of Pollux, and measured the related surface-averaged
longitudinal magnetic field Bl. The longitudinal field averaged over the span
of the observations is below one gauss. Our data suggest variations of the
longitudinal magnetic field, but no significant variation of the S-index. We
observe variations of RV which are qualitatively consistent with the published
ephemeris for a proposed exoplanet orbiting Pollux. The observed variations of
Bl appear to mimic those of RV, but additional data for this relationship to be
established. Using evolutionary models including the effects of rotation, we
derive the mass of Pollux and we discuss its evolutionary status and the origin
of its magnetic field. Conclusions: This work presents the first direct
detection of the magnetic field of Pollux, and demonstrates that ESPaDOnS and
NARVAL are capable of obtaining sub-G measurements of the surface-averaged
longitudinal magnetic field of giant stars, and of directly studying the
relationships between magnetic activity, stellar evolution and planet hosting
of these stars.

Verwey transition temperatures (Tv) of 123 and 117K, respectively. Both single
crystals reveal broad electronic background extending up to 900 wavenumbers

cooled below Tv. In particular, spectra of the low temperature phase show
diminished background below 300 wavenumbers followed by an enhancement of the
electronic background between 300 and 400 wavenumbers. To enhance the effect of
this background redistribution we divide the spectra just below the transition
by the spectra just above the transition. A resultant broad peak-like feature
is observed, centered at 370 wavenumbers (45 meV). The peak position of this

alternative assignments of this feature to a spin or charge gap in magnetite.

described by a regularized plasticity model that postulates a dependence of the

one-dimensional localization problem under certain special nonuniform stress
distributions. The one-dimensional problem can be interpreted as describing
either a tensile bar with variable cross section, or a beam subjected to a
nonuniform bending moment. Explicit as well as implicit gradient formulations
are considered. The evolution of the plastic strain profile and the shape of
the load-displacement diagram are investigated. It is shown that even if the
local constitutive law exhibits softening right from the onset of yielding, the
global load-displacement diagram has a hardening part. The interplay between
the internal length scales characterizing the material and the geometry is
discussed.

are remarkably different with the common control parameters ($D_{z}$,$B_{z}$

x-component parameters can increase the entanglement and the critical
temperature more efficiently. Furthermore, we show the properties of these
x-component parameters for the control of entanglement. In the ground state,
increasing $D_{x}$ (spin-orbit coupling parameter) can decrease the critical
value $b_{xc}$ and increase the entanglement in the revival region, and
adjusting some parameters (increasing $b_{x}$ and $J$, decreasing $B_{x}$ and
$\Delta$) can decrease the critical value $D_{xc}$ to enlarge the revival
region. In the thermal state, increasing $D_{x}$ can increase the revival
region and the entanglement in the revival region (for $T$ or $b_{x}$), and
enhance the critical value $B_{xc}$ to make the region of high entanglement
larger. Also, the entanglement and the revival region will increase with the
decrease of $B_{x}$ (uniform magnetic field). In addition, small $b_{x}$
(nonuniform magnetic field) has some similar properties to $D_{x}$, and with
the increase of $b_{x}$ the entanglement also has a revival phenomenon, so that
the entanglement can exist at higher temperature for larger $b_{x}$.

sufficiently regular) domain, this recovers, as a particular case of a general
result due to G. Grubb, that the eigenvalue problem for the Krein Laplacian
$S_K$ (i.e., the Krein--von Neumann extension of $S$), \[ S_K v = \lambda v,
\quad \lambda \neq 0, \] is in one-to-one correspondence with the problem of

transfer in a special relativistic framework. A simple hydrodynamics solver was
implemented to keep track of the energy conservation of the atmosphere during
free expansion. Results. The correct operation of the new additions to PHOENIX
were verified in test calculations. Conclusions. We have shown the correct
operation of our extension to time-dependent radiative transfer and will be
able to calculate supernova light curves and spectra in future work.

behaviors. The spherically symmetric black hole solutions for an arbitrary
cosmological constant, which represent the generalization of the standard
Schwarzschild-(A)dS solution, has also been obtained for the Horava-Lifshitz
theory. The exact asymptotically flat Schwarzschild type solution of the
gravitational field equations in Horava gravity contains a quadratic increasing
term, as well as the square root of a fourth order polynomial in the radial

modified Horava gravity seems to be consistent with the current observational
data, but in order to test its viability more observational constraints are
necessary. In the present paper we consider the possibility of observationally
testing Horava gravity by using the accretion disk properties around black
holes. The energy flux, temperature distribution, the emission spectrum as well
as the energy conversion efficiency are obtained, and compared to the standard
general relativistic case. Particular signatures can appear in the
electromagnetic spectrum, thus leading to the possibility of directly testing
Horava gravity models by using astrophysical observations of the emission
spectra from accretion disks.

Comparing with the ground-based experiments, Planck satellite can observe all
the CMB power spectra in all the multipole range, but having much larger
instrumental noises. We find that, for the uncertainty of the tensor-to-scalar
ratio $\Delta r$, PolarBear (II) as a typical ground-based experiment can give
much smaller value than Planck satellite. However, for the uncertainty of the
spectral index $\Delta n_t$, Planck can give the similar result with PolarBear
(II). If combining these two experiments, the value of $\Delta n_t$ can be
reduced by a factor 2. For the model with $r=0.1$, the constraint $\Delta
n_t=0.10$ is expected to be achieved, which provides an excellent opportunity
to study the physics in the very early universe. We also find the observation
in the largest scale ($\ell<20$) is very important for constraining the
spectral index $n_t$. So it is necessary to combine the observations of the
future space-based and ground-based CMB experiments to determine the relic

regions were reproduced equally well by a single-phase plasma emission model,
or by a two-phase model developed by {\it ASCA}, both incorporating cool
(1.7--2.0 keV) and hot ($\sim 4$ keV) plasma temperatures. However, EPIC
spectra with higher statistics, accumulated over 3-dimentional thick shell
regions, were reproduced better by the two-phase model than by the singe-phase
one. Therefore, hot and cool plasma phases are inferred to co-exist in the
cluster core region within $\sim 70$ kpc. The iron and silicon abundances of
the plasma were reconfirmed to increase significantly towards the center, while
that of oxygen was consistent with being radially constant. The implied
non-solar abundance ratios explains away the previously reported excess X-ray
absorption from the central region. Although an additional cool ($\sim 0.7$
keV) emission was detected within $\sim 20$ kpc of the center, the RGS data
gave tight upper limits on any emission with a tempeartures below $\sim 0.5$
keV. These results are compiled into a magnetosphere model, which interprets
the cool phase as confined within closed magnetic loops anchored to the cD
galaxy. When combined with so-called Rosner-Tucker-Vaiana mechanism which
applies to solar coronae, this model can potentially explain basic properties
of the cool phase, including its temperature and thermal stability.

walking unidirectionally along a cytoskeletal filament. While previous

to the so-called stall force, recent experiments also observed limited
processive backwalking under superstall loads. This theoretical study seeks to
elucidate the molecular mechanical basis for kinesin's steps over the full
range of external loads that can possibly be applied to the dimer. We found
that kinesin's load-resisting capacity is largely determined by a synergic
ratchet-and-pawl mechanism inherent in the dimer. Load susceptibility of this
inner molecular mechanical mechanism underlies kinesin's response to various
levels of external loads. Computational implementation of the mechanism enabled
us to rationalize major trends observed experimentally in kinesin's stalemate
and consecutive back steps. The study also predicts several distinct features
of kinesin's load-affected motility, which are seemingly counterintuitive but
readily verifiable by future experiment.

corrections above the Kosterlitz-Thouless temperature and interpret them as a
manifestation of free topological defects. Our estimates of the autocorrelation
exponent and the fluctuation-dissipation ratio differ from the XY values, while
$\eta(T_{\rm KT})$ lies at the boundary of the error bar. Indications for
logarithmic corrections at the second-order critical temperature are presented.
However, the coupling between angles and chiralities is still strong and
explains why autocorrelation exponent and fluctuation-dissipation ratio are far

variety of different ground states meeting in transition lines and
multicritical points. We study the dependence of the ground states of these
systems in the three dimensional space on physical parameters as exchange,
single ion and cubic anisotropy.
  One identifies four different ground states: the paramagnetic (PM), the
antiferromagnetic (AF), the spin flop (SF) and the biconical (BC) ground state.
In the case of absence of a cubic anisotropy the transition lines separating
the different ground states can be calculated analytically, otherwise they have
to be calculated numerically. We also considered the behavior of the staggered
magnetization which characterizes the different ground states. From its
behavior the order of the transition from one state to the other is determined.
But also the order of the transition changes along the transition lines when
including the cubic anisotropy, especially at the reeentrant region where a
transition from SF to BC and back to SF by increasing the external field $H$
occurs. Multicritical points are founded which are assumed to be tricritical or
critical endpoints. The results obtained may be relevant for other systems
since the antiferromagnetic model can be mapped to a lattice gas model where
the biconical ground state is interpreted as supersolid phase. Recent
renormalization group calculations show that such a phase would indicate the
existence of a tetracritical point.

equilibrium, and the flux of produced neutrinos is governed by the
sneutrino-proton elastic scattering cross section, which has an upper bound of
$8 \times 10^{-9}$ pb from the $Z^{\prime}$ mass limits in the $B-L$ model.
Despite the absence of any spin-dependent contribution, the muon event rates
predicted by this model can be detected at IceCube since sneutrinos mainly
annihilate into leptonic final states by virtue of the fermion $B-L$ charges.
These subsequently decay to neutrinos with 100% efficiency. The Earth muon
event rates are too small to be detected for the standard halo model
irrespective of an enhanced sneutrino annihilation cross section that can
explain the recent PAMELA data. For modified velocity distributions, the Earth
muon events increase substantially and can be greater than the IceCube
detection threshold of 12 events $\mathrm{km}^{-2}$ $\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$.
However, this only leads to a mild increase of about 30% for the Sun muon
events. The number of muon events from the Sun can be as large as roughly 100
events $\mathrm{km}^{-2}$ $\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ for this model.

non-perturbatively on a computer, and hence to test the AdS/CFT correspondence

check of this proposal by performing explicit calculations in the large-N

around a particular stable vacuum corresponding to RxS^3. At finite temperature
and at weak coupling, we reproduce precisely the deconfinement phase transition
in the N=4 super Yang-Mills theory on RxS^3. This phase transition is
considered to continue to the strongly coupled regime, where it corresponds to
the Hawking-Page transition on the AdS side. We also perform calculations
around other stable vacua, and reproduce the phase transition in super

possible correlation between the presence of nuclear radio variability and the
absence of ~100-pc-scale radio emission is seen. NGC2110 is the only source
with significant extended radio structure and strong nuclear variability (>38%
nuclear decline over seven years). Our results suggest that all Seyferts may
exhibit variation in their nuclear radio flux density at 8.4 GHz, but that
variability is more easily recognised in compact sources in which emission from
the variable nucleus is not diluted by unresolved, constant flux density
radio-jet emission within the central ~50 pc. If flares in radio light curves
correspond to ejection of new relativistic components or emergence of shocks in
the underlying flow, we suggest that radio jets may be intrinsically
non-relativistic during quiescence, but that Seyferts, as black-hole driven
AGN, have the capacity to accelerate relativistic jets during radio flares.
Taken together with the increased detection rate of flat spectrum radio nuclei
in Seyferts imaged at VLBI resolutions and the detection of variable water
megamaser emission, our results support the paradigm of intermittent periods of
quiescence and nuclear outburst across the Seyfert population. (Abridged).

studies of high-energy heavy-ion collisions measurements of proton-proton
interactions at unprecedented energies, too. This paper focuses on the global
event characterisation in terms of the multiplicity distribution of charged
hadrons and mean transverse momentum. These bulk observables become accessible
because the detector features excellent track reconstruction, especially at low
transverse momenta. The measurement of strange hadrons is of particular
interest since the strange-particle phase-space was found to be suppressed
beyond canonical reduction at lower center-of-mass energies and the production
mechanism of soft particles is not yet fully understood. Here we benefit in
particular from particle identification down to very low transverse momentum,
i.e. 100 - 300 MeV/c, giving access to spectra and integrated yields of
identified hadrons.
  Equipped with these features, ALICE will play a complementary role w.r.t.
other LHC experiments. New interest in the soft part of pp collisions arose
recently and new insights in the physics of the underlying event are expected
from both, theory and experiment.

systems in contact with heat reservoir is studied. Exact expressions of the
complex admittance are derived in various types of formulations of equations of
motion under contact with heat reservoir. Namely, the complex admittance is
studied in the relaxation method and the external-field method. In the former
method, the admittance is calculated using the Kubo formula for quantum systems
in contact with heat reservoir in no external driving fields, while in the
latter method the admittance is directly calculated from equations of motion
with external driving terms. In each method, two types of equation of motions
are considered, i.e., the time-convolution (TC) equation and
time-convolutionless (TCL) equation. That is, the full of the four cases are
studied. It is turned out that the expression of the complex admittance
obtained by using the relaxation method with the TC equation exactly coincides
with that obtained by using the external-field method with the TC equation,
while other two methods give different forms. It is also explicitly
demonstrated that all the expressions of the complex admittance coincide with
each other in the lowest Born approximation for the systemreservoir
interaction. The formulae necessary for the higher order expansions in powers
of the system-reservoir interaction are derived, and also the expressions of
the admittance in the n-th order approximation are given. To characterize the
TC and TCL methods, we study the expressions of the admittances of two exactly
solvable models. Each exact form of admittance is compared with the results of
the two methods in the lowest Born approximation. It is found that depending on
the model, either of TC and TCL would be the better method.

the statistical precision to which weak lensing observables, such as cosmic
shear correlation functions, can be determined. We construct a fitting formula
for the non-Gaussian part of the covariance of the lensing power spectrum. The
Gaussian contribution to the covariance, which is proportional to the lensing
power spectrum squared, and optionally shape noise can be included easily by
adding their contributions. Starting from a canonical estimator for the
dimensionless lensing power spectrum, we model first the covariance in the halo
model approach including all four halo terms for one fiducial cosmology and
then fit two polynomials to the expression found. On large scales, we use a
first-order polynomial in the wave-numbers and dimensionless power spectra that
goes asymptotically towards $1.1 C_{pt}$ for $\ell \to 0$, i.e., the result for
the non-Gaussian part of the covariance using tree-level perturbation theory.

dimensionless power spectra for the fit. We obtain a fitting formula for the

accurate to 10% for the off-diagonal elements, and to 5% for the diagonal

for six of the Milky Way's dwarf spheroidal galaxies. We test Osipkov-Merritt
velocity anisotropy profiles, but find that no benefit is gained over constant
velocity anisotropy. In contrast to previous attempts, we do not assume any
relation between the stellar velocity dispersions and the dark matter ones, but
instead we solve directly for the sterile neutrino velocity dispersion at all
radii by using the equation of state for a partially degenerate neutrino gas
(which ensures hydrostatic equilibrium of the sterile neutrino halo). This
yields a 1:1 relation between the sterile neutrino density and velocity
dispersion, and therefore gives us an accurate estimate of the Tremaine-Gunn
limit at all radii. By varying the sterile neutrino particle mass, we locate
the minimum mass for all six dwarf spheroidals such that the Tremaine-Gunn
limit is not exceeded at any radius (in particular at the centre). We find
sizeable differences between the ranges of feasible sterile neutrino particle
mass for each dwarf, but interestingly there exists a small range 270-280eV

spectral complexity in several observations. Red- and blue-shifted components

prediction in which binding pockets are represented by atom clouds. Each target
pocket is compared to an ensemble of pockets of known ligands. Pockets are
aligned in 3D space with further use of convolution kernels between clouds of
points. Performance of the new method for ligand prediction is compared to
those of other available measures and to docking programs. We discuss two
criteria to compare the quality of similarity measures: area under ROC curve
(AUC) and classification based scores. We show that the latter is better suited
to evaluate the methods with respect to ligand prediction. Our results on
existing and new benchmarks indicate that the new method outperforms other

larger than the analogous extended radio emission observed in M87 - the
dominant central radio galaxy in the Virgo Cluster. However, in MRC 0116+111 we
do not detect any ongoing Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) activity, such as a
compact core or active radio jets feeding the plasma bubbles. The radio
emitting relativistic particles and magnetic fields were probably seeded in the
past by a pair of radio-jets originating in the AGN of the central cD galaxy.
The extremely steep high-frequency radio spectrum of the north-western bubble,
located ~100 kpc from cluster centre, indicates radiation losses, possibly
because having detached, it is rising buoyantly and moving away into the
putative hot intra-cluster medium. The other bubble, closer to the cluster
centre, shows signs of ongoing particle re-acceleration. We estimate that the
radio jets which inflated these two bubbles might have also fed enough energy
into the intra-cluster medium to create an enormous system of cavities and
shock fronts, and to drive a massive outflow from the AGN, which could
counter-balance and even quench a cooling flow. Therefore, this source presents
an excellent opportunity to understand the energetics and the dynamical
evolution of radio-jet inflated plasma bubbles in the hot cluster atmosphere.

for the Minimal Anomalous $U(1)'$ Extension of the MSSM where the anomalies are
cancelled by the Green-Schwarz mechanism and the addition of Chern-Simons
terms, stressing the main differences between our model and the MSSM. The
advantage of this choice over the standard one is that it allows for arbitrary
values of the quantum numbers of the extra U(1). As a first step towards the
study of hadron annihilations producing four leptons in the final state (a
clean signal which might be studied at LHC) we then compute the decays $Z'\to
Z_0 \g$ and $Z'\to Z_0 Z_0$. We find that the largest values of the decay rate

at most of the order of 10. Then we compute the relic density predicted by our

Theory and formal scattering theory, that off-shell and many-body effects can
not be separated.This 'equivalence theorem' allows us to concentrate on the
off-shell effects.Examples of on-shell equivalent potentials Paris, Bonn etc
but here separable potentials are calculated by inverse scattering from
NN-scattering and Deuteron data, Earlier calculations showed these S-state
potentials to agree with Bonn-B results in Brueckner nuclear matter
calculations. They are here also used to compute the Triton binding energy and
the n-D scattering length.The results are found to lie on the Phillips line
defined in early calculations but like these miss the experimental point on
this line and overbind the Triton but is reached by modifying the off-shell
properties adding a short-range repulsion without affecting fits to the
experimental low-energy phase-shifts.The off-shell induced correlations result
in a repulsive component in the Triton effective interactions.In nuclear matter
the same effect is referred to as the dispersion correction, which is a main
contributor to nuclear saturation.In finite nucleus Brueckner-HF calculations
these same correlations give an important contribution to the selfconsistent

purpose of the present work is to illustrate that NN-correlations are as
important in the Triton as they are in nuclear matter or other finite nuclei.

when the internal choice is quantified with probabilities. However, ever since
probabilities have been introduced in process semantics, it has been a
challenge to preserve the unobservability of the random choice, while not

addresses this problem. It proposes two semantics for processes where the
internal nondeterminism has been quantified with probabilities. The first one
is based on the notion of testing, i.e. interaction between the process and its

on the notion of observability. Both are shown to coincide. They are also

first order form in any dimension higher than two, is analyzed. This
Hamiltonian formulation allows to explicitly show where peculiarities of three
dimensional case (\textit{A.M.Frolov et al, 0902.0856 [gr-qc]}) occur and make
a conjecture, based on presented in this report results, that there is one
general for \textit{all} dimensions characteristic of N-bein formulation of
gravity: after elimination of second class constraints the algebra of Poisson
brackets among remaining first class secondary constraints is the Poincare
algebra and in all dimensions N-bein, Cartan-Einstein, gravity \textit{is the
Poincare gauge theory}. The gauge symmetry corresponding to the algebra of
first class constraints has two parameters - rotational (Lorentz) and
translational. Translational invariance is common to all dimensions but some
terms in general expressions for gauge transformations of N-beins and
connections are zero in a particular, three dimensional, case.
  The proof of our conjecture is outlined in detail. Some straightforward but
tedious calculations remain to be completed to call our conjecture - a theorem
and will be reported later.

Neutrino emission from each of the neutron stars of the binary system,
increases the star binding energy and thus translates to a decrease in their
masses. This in turn implies an increase with time of the binary period. Using
the pulsar data we obtain an upper limit on the allowed rate of mass reduction
: $| \dot{M}| <1.1 \times 10^{-12} yr^{-1} M $, where $M$ is the total mass of
the binary. This constrains exotic nuclear equations of state that predict
continuous neutrino emissions. The limit applies also to other channels of
energy loss, e.g. axion emission. Continued timing measurements of additional
binary pulsars, should yield a stronger limit in the future.

Throughout this paper, we restrict ourselves to the case of minimal

soft faults in the network wirings. Here, the main result states that the
measurement of two reflection coefficients, associated to two different sets of

suggesting an overabundance of N and Si relative to C. The abundance pattern is
consistent a fast chemical enriching process associated with a recent
starburst. The outflow extends to several tens to hundred parsecs from the
quasar, and covers only a very small sky. We find that the outflow with line
emitting gas is energetically insufficient to remove the ISM of the host
galaxy. The velocity range and the column density suggest that the outflow
might be part of the low ionization broad absorption line region as seen in a
small class of quasars. The optical and UV continuum is starlight-dominated and
can be modelled with a young-aged (1 Myr) plus an intermediate-aged (~0.5-1
Gyr) stellar populations, suggesting a fast building of the stellar mass in the
host galaxy, consistent with the starburst-type metal abundances inferred from
the high velocity outflow spectrum. The broad band spectral energy distribution
shows that it is an obscured quasar with its bulk emission in the middle

even predict -- such a kind of behavior ? How far are we from materials design
using correlated oxides ? These are the central questions we try to address in
this article. We review recent attempts of calculating optical properties of
correlated materials within dynamical mean field theory, and summarize results
for vanadium dioxide obtained within a novel scheme aiming at particularly
simple and efficient calculations of optical transition matrix elements within
localized basis sets. Finally, by optimizing the geometry of ""intelligent
windows"", we argue that this kind of technique can in principle be used to
provide guidance for experiments, thus giving a rather optimistic answer to the
above questions.

compounds of a particular crystal structure form a straight line on a map using
Miedema parameters. In this paper, the universality of that observation is
examined. Observations from a study of 143 binary systems that crystallize in
six different crystal structures at AB3 composition are discussed. Prediction
of concomitant and mutually exclusive structure types in binary metallic phase
diagrams, and of phase transitions among different structure types, has been
demonstrated. This behavior is unexpected because Miedema parameters are
isotropic in nature and structural energies are generally assumed to be small.
We argue in this paper that each point on the map stands for the energy of an
unlike atom-pair (A-B) bond, with the bond energy remaining nearly the same at
all compositions in the phase diagram. This argument is confirmed by comparing
the nearest-neighbour (A-B) bond lengths for the compounds of the structure
types CaCu5 and CsCl, when concomitant with MgCu2 structure type. This fact
leads to an important conclusion that one can define a bond energy for the
metallic unlike-atom-pair bond as is usually done for a conventional chemical
bond.

the spectral radius $\rho(G)$ of a planar graph $G$ of maximum vertex degree
$D\ge 4$ satisfies $\sqrt{D}\le \rho(G)\le \sqrt{8D-16}+7.75$. This result is
best possible up to the additive constant--we construct an (infinite) planar
graph of maximum degree $D$, whose spectral radius is $\sqrt{8D-16}$. This
generalizes and improves several previous results and solves an open problem
proposed by Tom Hayes. Similar bounds are derived for graphs of bounded genus.
For every $k$, these bounds can be improved by excluding $K_{2,k}$ as a
subgraph. In particular, the upper bound is strengthened for 5-connected
graphs. All our results hold for finite as well as for infinite graphs.
  At the end we enhance the graph decomposition method introduced in the first
part of the paper and apply it to tessellations of the hyperbolic plane. We
derive bounds on the spectral radius that are close to the true value, and even
in the simplest case of regular tessellations of type $\{p,q\}$ we derive an
essential improvement over known results, obtaining exact estimates in the

to a smaller inner region where both sides of an expanding bubble were seen. In

spectroscopic studies, taken under atmospheric conditions better than those
previously reported, allowing us to detect the approaching and receding walls
of one the largest bubbles in external galaxies ever studied in detail.
  The kinematical analysis shows a large expanding bubble, whose walls appear
to be highly structured with superposed smaller shells, likely originated as
the result of star forming events occurring at the edges of the larger scale
shell, a la Huygens. We also study some diagnostic diagrams of the ionized gas
and conclude that most of the observed ionization is originated by photons from
hot stars, but with clear evidence that some of the gas is shock ionized.
