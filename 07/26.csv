application to electrochemical systems. Consistent treatment of the
electrochemical system as comprising two interacting subsystems - the chemical
and the electrical (electrochemical) - leads to ln-logistic map of states of
the electrochemical system with non-unity coefficient of the electrical charge
transfer. This factor provides for a feedback and causes dynamic behavior of
electrochemical systems, including bifurcations and electrochemical
oscillations. The latter occur beyond bifurcation point at essential deviation
of the chemical subsystem from true thermodynamic equilibrium. If the charge
transfer coefficient takes on unity, the map turns into classical equation of
electrochemical equilibrium. Spectra of electrochemical oscillations, resulted
from the DTD formalism, are multifractals. Graphical solutions of this work are
qualitatively compared to some experimental results.

of partons with the dense medium produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions

contributions, NA49 has performed an energy and system-size scan of
two-particle azimuthal correlations in Pb+Pb, Si+Si and p+p collisions at
sqrt(sNN) = 17.3 GeV, as well as central Pb+Pb collisions at 6.3, 7.6, 8.8 and
12.3 GeV. These results were compared to UrQMD simulations.
  NA49 results show a flattened away side of C2(dphi) in central Pb+Pb (Au+Au)
collisions which depends weakly on collision energy even for low SPS energies.
This is at odds with the standard scenario of parton energy loss. On the other
hand, the near-side peak amplitude drops visibly with decreasing collision
energy, turning into a depletion below sqrt(sNN) = 8.8 GeV. UrQMD describes the
correlation functions on the away side but disagrees on the near side.

indicative of traces of superconductivity have been observed in some samples of
M=Ba (Tc ~ 20 K, up to 25% drop in resistivity) and M=Ca (Tc ~ 10 K, up to 45 %

finite fraction of Meissner flux expulsion, has been observed in M=Sr, Tc = 22
K. Using In-flux grown single crystal samples of undoped BaFe2As2, we find a
complete drop in the resistivity to 0 in most samples beginning at Tc(onset) =
22.5 K. However, in contrast to the SrFe2As2 results, there is no measurable
Meissner effect and no suppression of the resistive superconducting transition
with annealing. The current sensitivity of the superconducting resistive
transition in our samples of BaFe2As2 is quite strong, with an increase in the
current density of a factor of 15 to ~ 1.5 A/cm2 not changing Tc(onset) but
broadening the transition significantly and causing the resistivity to remain
finite as T approaches 0. To investigate if this unusually low critical current
is indicative of filamentary conduction lacking the apparent anisotropy seen in
the critical magnetic field, Hc2, measurements of, e. g., the bulk
superconductor Co-doped BaFe2As2, Hc2 was measured in both crystalline
directions. These BaFe2As2 samples show Hc2(T) values in the ab-plane and along
the c-axis comparable to those seen in BaFe2-xCoxAs2, which has a similar Tc.
Since the lack of Tc suppression after annealing argues against strain-induced
superconductivity as proposed for the other undoped MFe2As2 materials, another
possible cause for the superconductivity in BaFe2As2 is discussed.

highlights the importance of careful sample handling when making measurements
on SMM crystals containing volatile lattice solvents. The HFEPR data
additionally provide important spectroscopic evidence suggesting that the
relatively weak disorder induced by desolvation strongly influences the quantum
tunneling interactions, and that it is under-barrier tunneling that is
responsible for a consistent reduction in Ueff that is found upon drying
samples. Meanwhile, the axial anisotropy deduced from HFEPR is found to be
virtually identical for all four Mn12 complexes, with essentially no measurable
reduction upon desolvation.

vertical direction as they rise. This rotation of the filament axis is
generally interpreted as a conversion of twist into writhe in a kink-unstable
magnetic flux rope. Consistent with this interpretation, the rotation is
usually found to be clockwise (as viewed from above) if the post-eruption
arcade has right-handed helicity, but counterclockwise if it has left-handed
helicity. Here, we describe two non--active-region filament events recorded
with the Extreme-Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) on the {\it Solar and
Heliospheric Observatory} ({\it SOHO}), in which the sense of rotation appears
to be opposite to that expected from the helicity of the post-event arcade.
Based on these observations, we suggest that the rotation of the filament axis
is in general determined by the net helicity of the erupting system, and that
the axially aligned core of the filament can have the opposite helicity sign to
the surrounding field. In most cases, the surrounding field provides the main
contribution to the net helicity. In the events reported here, however, the
helicity associated with the filament ``barbs'' is opposite in sign to and
dominates that of the overlying arcade.

rotational velocity and the gravitational acceleration at the primary surface
simulated. The results show the distortion at the outer layers of the primary
increases with temporal variation and system evolution. Besides, it was
observed that the luminosity accretion is unstable, and the curve of the
energy-generation rate fluctuates after the main sequence in rotation
sequences. The luminosity in rotation sequences is slightly weaker than that in
non-rotation sequences. As a result, the volume expands slowly. Polar ejection
is intensified by the tidal effect. The ejection of an equatorial ring may be
favoured by both the opacity effect and the $g_{e}(\theta,\varphi)$-effect in

galaxies, containing clumpy and turbulent rings or disks, we build a set of
equations describing the dynamical evolution of gaseous disks with inclusion of
star formation and its feedback. Transport of angular momentum is due to
""turbulent"" viscosity induced by supernova explosions in the star formation
region. Analytical solutions of the equations are found for the initial cases
of a gaseous ring and the integrated form for a gaseous disk, respectively. For
a ring with enough low viscosity, it evolves in a slow processes of gaseous
diffusion and star formation near the initial radius. For a high viscosity, the
ring rapidly diffuses in the early phase. The diffusion drives the ring into a
region with a low viscosity and start the second phase undergoing pile-up of
gas at a radius following the decreased viscosity torque. The third is a
sharply deceasing phase because of star formation consumption of gas and
efficient transportation of gas inward forming a stellar disk. We apply the
model to two $z\sim 2$ galaxies BX 482 and BzK 6004, and find that they are
undergoing a decline in their star formation activity.

generally cross-helical or non-balanced, in that the energies of Afv\'en waves
moving in opposite directions along the guide magnetic field are unequal. Based
on high-resolution numerical simulations it is proposed that such turbulence
spontaneously generates a condensate of the residual energy $E_v-E_b$ at small
field-parallel wave numbers. As a result, the energy spectra of
counter-propagating Alfv\'en waves are not scale-invariant. In the limit of
infinite Reynolds number, the universality is asymptotically restored at large
wave numbers, and both spectra attain the scaling $E(k)\propto k_{\perp}^{-2}$.
The generation of condensate is apparently related to the breakdown of mirror
symmetry in non-balanced turbulence.

performed. It is shown that precision measurements of the differential cross
section of the reaction $\bar p +p \to e^++ e^-$ can be obtained in a wide
angular and kinematical range. The individual determination of the moduli of
the electric and magnetic proton form factors will be possible up to a value of
momentum transfer squared of $q^2\simeq 14$ (GeV/c)$^2$. The total $\bar p
+p\to e^++e^-$ cross section will be measured up to $q^2\simeq 28$ (GeV/c)$^2$.
The results obtained from simulated events are compared to the existing data.
Sensitivity to the two photons exchange mechanism is also investigated.
