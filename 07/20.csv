behaved alternative to the number-phase uncertainty relation, and examine its
properties. We find a formulation in which the bound on the product of
uncertainties depends on the expectation value of the particle number. Thus,
while the bound is not a constant, it is a quantity that can easily be
controlled in many systems. The uncertainty relation is approximately saturated
by number-phase intelligent states. This allows us to define amplitude
squeezing, connecting coherent states to Fock states, without a reference to a
phase operator. We propose several setups for an experimental verification.

Resolving whether or how many of such states exist requires a careful approach
to the problem of model selection, here meaning discriminating among models
with differing numbers of states. The most straightforward approach to model
selection generalizes the common idea of maximum likelihood-selecting the most
likely parameter values-to maximum evidence: selecting the most likely model.
In either case, such inference presents a tremendous computational challenge,
which we here address by exploiting an approximation technique termed
variational Bayes. We demonstrate how this technique can be applied to temporal

to the maximum likelihood approach; and illustrate how model selection in such
probabilistic or generative modeling can facilitate analysis of closely related

scintillation signal in DAMA/LIBRA versus the absence of a signal for nuclear
recoils in experiments like CDMS or XENON10. However, even in such a
leptophilic DM scenario there are loop induced DM-hadron interactions, where
the photons emitted from virtual leptons couple to the charge of a nucleus.
Using a general effective field theory approach we show that, if such an
interaction is induced at one or two-loop level, then DM-nucleus scattering
dominates over DM-electron scattering. This is because the latter is suppressed
by the bound state wave function. One obtains a situation similar to standard
DM-nucleus scattering analyses with considerable tension between the results of
DAMA and CDMS/XENON10. This conclusion does not apply in the case of
pseudoscalar or axial vector coupling between DM and leptons, where the loop
diagrams vanish. In this case the explanation of the DAMA signal in terms of
DM-electron scattering is strongly disfavored by the spectral shape of the
signal. Furthermore, if DM can annihilate into neutrinos or tau leptons, the
required cross sections are excluded by many orders of magnitude using the
Super-Kamiokande bound on neutrinos from DM annihilations in the Sun.

flows in the collapsing cloud core: Low-velocity outflows (sim 5 km/s) with a
wide opening angle, driven from the first adiabatic core, and high-velocity
jets (sim 50 km/s) with good collimation, driven from the protostar.
High-velocity jets are enclosed by low-velocity outflow. The difference in the
degree of collimation between the two flows is caused by the strength of the
magnetic field and configuration of the magnetic field lines. The magnetic
field around an adiabatic core is strong and has an hourglass configuration.
Therefore, the low-velocity outflow from the adiabatic core are driven mainly
by the magnetocentrifugal mechanism and guided by the hourglass-like field
lines. In contrast, the magnetic field around the protostar is weak and has a
straight configuration owing to Ohmic dissipation in the high-density gas
region. Therefore, high-velocity jet from the protostar are driven mainly by
the magnetic pressure gradient force and guided by straight field lines.
Differing depth of the gravitational potential between the adiabatic core and
the protostar cause the difference of the flow speed. Low-velocity outflows
correspond to the observed molecular outflows, while high-velocity jets
correspond to the observed optical jets. We suggest that the protostellar
outflow and the jet are driven by different cores (the first adiabatic core and
protostar), rather than that the outflow being entrained by the jet.

holes is key to understanding the merger history and growth of galaxies.
Mergers between ~100 solar mass seed black holes generate gravitational waves
in the 0.1-10Hz band that lies between the sensitivity bands of existing
ground-based detectors and the planned space-based gravitational wave detector,
the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). However, there are proposals for
more advanced detectors that will bridge this gap, including the third
generation ground-based Einstein Telescope and the space-based detector DECIGO.
In this paper we demonstrate that such future detectors should be able to
detect gravitational waves produced by the coalescence of the first generation
of light seed black-hole binaries and provide information on the evolution of
structure in that era. These observations will be complementary to those that
LISA will make of subsequent mergers between more massive black holes. We
compute the sensitivity of various future detectors to seed black-hole mergers,
and use this to explore the number and properties of the events that each
detector might see in three years of observation. For this calculation, we make
use of galaxy merger trees and two different seed black hole mass distributions
in order to construct the astrophysical population of events. We also consider
the accuracy with which networks of future ground-based detectors will be able
to measure the parameters of seed black hole mergers, in particular the
luminosity distance to the source. We show that distance precisions of ~30% are
achievable, which should be sufficient for us to say with confidence that the
sources are at high redshift.

that its Higgs sector has just two dimension-five operators, which are obtained
from the power series of the energy scale for the new physics in the effective
action analysis. We study the possibility of spontaneous CP violation in the
Higgs sector of the DSTM, which consists of two Higgs doublets. We find that
the CP violation may be triggered spontaneously by a complex phase, obtained as
the relative phase between the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs
doublets. At the tree level, for a reasonably established parameter region, the
masses of the three neutral Higgs bosons and their corresponding coupling
coefficients to a pair of $Z$ bosons in the DSTM are calculated such that the
results are inconsistent with the experimental constraint by the LEP data.
Thus, the LEP2 data exclude the possibility of spontaneous CP violation in the
DSTM at the tree level. On the other hand, we find that, for a wide area in the
parameter region, the CP symmetry may be broken spontaneously in the Higgs
sector of the DSTM at the one-loop level, where top quark and scalar top quark
loops are taken into account. The upper bound on the radiatively corrected mass
of the lightest neutral Higgs boson of the DSTM is about 87 GeV, in the
spontaneous CP violation scenario. We confirm that the LEP data does not

both on the theoretical side and in view of the limited availability of

flows and long-range airline traffic in shaping the spatio-temporal pattern of
a global epidemic we i) analyze mobility data from 29 countries around the
world and find a gravity model able to provide a global description of
commuting patterns up to 300 kms; ii) integrate in a worldwide structured
metapopulation epidemic model a time-scale separation technique for evaluating
the force of infection due to multiscale mobility processes in the disease
dynamics. Commuting flows are found, on average, to be one order of magnitude
larger than airline flows. However, their introduction into the worldwide model
shows that the large scale pattern of the simulated epidemic exhibits only
small variations with respect to the baseline case where only airline traffic
is considered. The presence of short range mobility increases however the
synchronization of subpopulations in close proximity and affects the epidemic
behavior at the periphery of the airline transportation infrastructure. The
present approach outlines the possibility for the definition of layered
computational approaches where different modeling assumptions and granularities
can be used consistently in a unifying multi-scale framework.

combine to improve parameter estimation. We consider supermassive black hole
binaries as expected to be observed with the planned space-based interferometer
LISA, and study the measurement accuracy for several astrophysically
interesting parameters obtainable taking into account the full 2PN waveform for
spinning bodies, as well as spin-precession effects. We find that for binaries
with a total mass in the range 10^5 M_Sun < M < 10^7 M_Sun at a redshift of 1,
a factor ~1.5 is in general gained in accuracy, with the notable exception of
the determination of the individual masses in equal-mass systems, for which a
factor ~5 can be gained. We also find, as could be expected, that using the
full waveform helps increasing the upper mass limit for detection, which can be
as high as M = 10^8 M_Sun at a redshift of 1, as well as the redshift limit
where some information can be extracted from a system, which is roughly z = 10
for M < 10^7 M_Sun, 1.5-5 times higher than with the restricted waveform. We
computed that the full waveform allows to use supermassive black hole binaries
as standard sirens up to a redshift of z = 1.6, about 0.4 larger than what
previous studies allowed. We found that for lower unequal-mass binary systems,
the measurement accuracy is not as drastically improved as for other systems.
This suggests that for these systems, adding parameters such as eccentricity or
alternative gravity parameters could be achieved without much loss in the
accuracy.

pervasively inconsistent information. Inconsistency Robustness of the community
of professional mathematicians is their performance repeatedly repairing

deriving contradictions have been a progressive development and not ""game

""swept under the rug"" by denying their existence, which has been repeatedly
attempted by Establishment Philosophers (beginning with some Pythagoreans).
Such denial has delayed mathematical development. This article reports how

foundations of mathematics for Computer Science continuing a tradition
developing the sociological basis for foundations.
  The current common understanding is that G\""odel proved ""Mathematics cannot

mathematics is proved by a simple argument in this article. Consequently, the
current common understanding that G\""odel proved ""Mathematics cannot prove its

  Wittgenstein long ago showed that contradiction in mathematics results from
the kind of ""self-referential"" sentence that G\""odel used in his argument that
mathematics cannot prove its own consistency. However, using a typed grammar
for mathematical sentences, it can be proved that the kind ""self-referential""
sentence that G\""odel used in his argument cannot be constructed because
required the fixed point that G\""odel used to the construct the
""self-referential"" sentence does not exist. In this way, consistency of

some physical equations describing the engine behaviour, is built for the
rotation speed and the exhaust gas opacity. The model is composed of three
interconnected neural submodels, each of them constituting a nonlinear
multi-input single-output error model. The structural identification and the
parameter estimation from data gathered on a real engine are described. The
neural direct model is then used to determine a neural controller of the
engine, in a specialized training scheme minimising a multivariable criterion.
Simulations show the effect of the pollution constraint weighting on a
trajectory tracking of the engine speed. Neural networks, which are flexible
and parsimonious nonlinear black-box models, with universal approximation
capabilities, can accurately describe or control complex nonlinear systems,
with little a priori theoretical knowledge. The presented work extends optimal
neuro-control to the multivariable case and shows the flexibility of neural
optimisers. Considering the preliminary results, it appears that neural
networks can be used as embedded models for engine control, to satisfy the more

able to model nonlinear dynamics and outperform during transients the control
schemes based on static mappings.

blueward peak and the redward peak of the emission profile. The Ca II H and K
emission lines probe the differential motion of certain chromospheric layers in
the stellar atmosphere. Data on V/R for the Ca II K line are drawn from
previous papers and compared to the analogous H line ratio, the H and K spectra
being from the same sets of observations. It is found that the H line V/R value
is +0.04 larger, on average, than the equivalent K line ratio, however, the
difference varies with B-V color. Red giants cooler than B-V = 1.2 are more
likely to have the H line V/R larger than the K line V/R, whereas the opposite
is true for giants hotter than B-V = 1.2. The differences between the Ca II H
and K line asymmetries could be caused by the layers of chromospheric material
from which these emission features arise moving with different velocities in an
expanding outflow.

the wavelength. We take advantage of new experimental spectra measured for free
particles dispersed in air with accompanying information on the grain

of spherical grains, as well as for compact grain shapes corresponding to
Gaussian random spheres. Irregular particle shapes require a DFF similar to
that of a Gaussian random sphere with sigma=0.3, whereas roundish grain shapes
are best fitted with that of a fractal aggregate of a fractal dimension
2.4-1.8. In addition we used a fitting algorithm to obtain the best-fit DFFs
for the various laboratory samples. In this way we can independently derive
information on the shape of the grains from their infrared spectra. For
anisotropic materials, different DFFs are needed for the different
crystallographic axes. This is due to a theoretical problem, which is inherent

Further, it is shown that the 4x4 reversible gates proposed for designing of a

thirty percent of the YSOs showed quasi-sinusoidal light curve shapes with
apparent periods from 5-12 days and light curve amplitudes approximately
independent of wavelength over the IRAC bandpasses. We have constructed models
which simulate the time dependent spectral energy distributions of Class I and
I I YSOs in order to attempt to explain these light curves. Based on these
models, the apparently periodic light curves are best explained by YSO models
where one or two high latitude photospheric spots heat the inner wall of the
circumstellar disk, and where we view the disk at fairly large inclination
angle. Disk inhomogeneities, such as increasing the height where the accretion
funnel flows to the stellar hotspot, enhances the light curve modulations. The
other YSOs in our sample show a range of light curve shapes, some of which are
probably due to varying accretion rate or disk shadowing events. One star,

metric reduces to a Fisher-Rao metric, reflecting an underlying classical
probability distribution. Furthermore, this metric can be expressed in terms of
derivatives of the free energy, indicating a relation to Ruppeiner geometry.
This allows us to obtain exact expressions for the (suitably rescaled) metric
in the thermodynamic limit. The phase transition of the isotropic LMG model is
signalled by a degeneracy of this (improper) metric in the paramagnetic phase.
Due to the integrability of the isotropic LMG model, ground state level
crossings occur, leading to an ill-defined fidelity metric at zero temperature.

component failure behavior is dependent on configuration and environment, the
available information about the constituent component of robots is most of the
time imprecise, incomplete, vague and conflicting and so it is very difficult
to analyze their behavior and to predict their failure pattern. The reliability
analysis of any system provides an understanding about the likelihood of
failures occurring in the system/component and the increased insight about its
inherent weakness. The objective of this paper is to quantify the uncertainties
that makes the decision more realistic, generic and extendable to application
domain. In this paper various reliability parameters (such as mean time between
failures, expected number of failures, reliability, availability etc.) are
computed using Fuzzy Lambda-Tau methodology. Triangular fuzzy numbers are used
to represent failure rates and repair times as they allow expert opinion,
linguistic variables, operating conditions, uncertainty and imprecision in
reliability information, to be incorporated into system model. Petri Nets are
used because unlike the fault tree methodology, the use of Petri Nets allows
efficient simultaneous generation of minimal cut and path sets.

a given distance from the cell on a CCD sensor. The image, in the near field,
shows speckles, since it is formed by the stochastical interference of the
light coming from a random sample. I show that, under suitable conditions, the
correlation function of such a field closely mirrors the correlation function
of the investigated sample; moreover, in general, from the correlation function
of the speckle field it is possible to calculate the scattered intensity. I

distorting the couplings via Ornstein-Uhlenbeck flows, and (b) replacing a
small fraction of the couplings by independent copies. We further prove that
the S-K model exhibits multiple valleys in its energy landscape, in the weak
sense that there are many states with near-minimal energy that are mutually
nearly orthogonal. We show that the variance of the free energy of the S-K
model is unusually small at any temperature. (By `unusually small' we mean that
it is much smaller than the number of sites; in other words, it beats the
classical Gaussian concentration inequality, a phenomenon that we call
`superconcentration'.) We prove that the bond overlap in the Edwards-Anderson

large perturbations. Lastly, we obtain sharp lower bounds on the variance of

Refinement code), which has adopted a novel approach to improve the performance
of adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) astrophysical simulations by a large factor
with the use of the graphic processing unit (GPU). The AMR implementation is
based on a hierarchy of grid patches with an oct-tree data structure. We adopt
a three-dimensional relaxing TVD scheme for the hydrodynamic solver, and a
multi-level relaxation scheme for the Poisson solver. Both solvers have been
implemented in GPU, by which hundreds of patches can be advanced in parallel.
The computational overhead associated with the data transfer between CPU and
GPU is carefully reduced by utilizing the capability of asynchronous memory
copies in GPU, and the computing time of the ghost-zone values for each patch
is made to diminish by overlapping it with the GPU computations. We demonstrate
the accuracy of the code by performing several standard test problems in
astrophysics. GAMER is a parallel code that can be run in a multi-GPU cluster
system. We measure the performance of the code by performing purely-baryonic
cosmological simulations in different hardware implementations, in which
detailed timing analyses provide comparison between the computations with and
without GPU(s) acceleration. Maximum speed-up factors of 12.19 and 10.47 are
demonstrated using 1 GPU with 4096^3 effective resolution and 16 GPUs with
8192^3 effective resolution, respectively.

for pre-alternative algebras, namely, pre-alternative bialgebras, which
exhibits all the familiar properties of the famous Lie bialgebra theory. In
particular, a pre-alternative bialgebra is equivalent to a phase space of an
alternative algebra and our study leads to what we called $PA$-equations in a
pre-alternative algebra, which are analogues of the classical Yang-Baxter

of slowly and rapidly rotating magnetized stars using axisymmetric and
exploratory 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. We find long-lasting
outflows in both cases. (1) In the case of slowly rotating stars, a new type of
outflow, a conical wind, is found and studied in simulations. The conical winds
appear in cases where the magnetic flux of the star is bunched up by the disk
into an X-type configuration. The winds have the shape of a thin conical shell
with a half-opening angle 30-40 degrees. The conical winds may be responsible
for episodic as well as long-lasting outflows in different types of stars. (2)
In the case of rapidly rotating stars (the ""propeller regime""), a two-component
outflow is observed. One component is similar to the conical winds. A
significant fraction of the disk matter may be ejected into the winds. A second
component is a high-velocity, low-density magnetically dominated axial jet
where matter flows along the opened polar field lines of the star. The jet has
a mass flux about 10% that of the conical wind, but its energy flux (dominantly
magnetic) can be larger than the energy flux of the conical wind. The jet's
angular momentum flux (also dominantly magnetic) causes the star to spin-down
rapidly. Propeller-driven outflows may be responsible for the jets in
protostars and for their rapid spin-down. The jet is collimated by the magnetic
force while the conical winds are only weakly collimated in the simulation
region.

equation for an incompressible velocity field and the advection-diffusion
equation for a scalar field transported in the same flow in two dimensions

forcing fields with Gaussian statistics, white-noise in time and self-similar
in space. In this setting and if the stirring is concentrated at small spatial
scales as if due to thermal fluctuations, it is possible to carry out a
first-principle ultra-violet renormalization group analysis of the scaling
behavior of the model.
  Kraichnan's phenomenological theory of two dimensional turbulence upholds the
existence of an inertial range characterized by inverse energy transfer at
scales larger than the stirring one. For our model Kraichnan's theory, however,
implies scaling predictions radically discordant from the renormalization group
results. We perform accurate numerical experiments to assess the actual
statistical properties of 2d-turbulence with power-law stirring. Our results
clearly indicate that an adapted version of Kraichnan's theory is consistent
with the observed phenomenology. We also provide some theoretical scenarios to
account for the discrepancy between renormalization group analysis and the
observed phenomenology.

chaotic quasiperiodic kicked rotor with three incommensurate frequencies -- we
study experimentally and theoretically the Anderson metal-insulator transition
in three dimensions. Sensitive measurements of the atomic wavefunction and the
use of finite-size scaling techniques make it possible to unambiguously
demonstrate the existence of a quantum phase transition and to measure its
critical exponents. By taking proper account of systematic corrections to
one-parameter scaling, we show the universality of the critical exponent
$\nu=1.59\pm0.01,$ which is found to be equal to the one previously computed
for the Anderson model.

optics, enabling the creation of squeezing and entanglement. We demonstrate the
parametric amplification of vacuum fluctuations for matter waves using a spinor
F=2 Rb-87 condensate. Interatomic interactions lead to correlated pair creation
in the m_F= +/- 1 states from an initial unstable m_F=0 condensate, which acts
as a vacuum for m_F unequal 0. Although this pair creation from a pure m_F=0
condensate is ideally triggered by vacuum fluctuations, unavoidable spurious
initial m_F= +/- 1 atoms induce a classical seed which may become the dominant
triggering mechanism. We show that pair creation is insensitive to a classical
seed for sufficiently large magnetic fields, demonstrating the dominant role of
vacuum fluctuations. The presented system thus provides a direct path towards
the generation of non-classical states of matter on the basis of spinor
condensates.

on a timescale of approximately 11 years. The current activity minimum has
attracted considerable interest because of its unusual duration and depth. This
raises the question: what might be happening beneath the surface where the
magnetic activity ultimately originates? The surface activity can be linked to
the conditions in the solar interior by the observation and analysis of the
frequencies of the Sun's natural seismic modes of oscillation - the p modes.
These seismic frequencies respond to changes in activity and are probes of
conditions within the Sun. The Birmingham Solar-Oscillations Network (BiSON)
has made measurements of p-mode frequencies over the last three solar activity
cycles, and so is in a unique position to explore the current unusual and
extended solar minimum. We show that the BiSON data reveal significant
variations of the p-mode frequencies during the current minimum. This is in
marked contrast to the surface activity observations, which show little
variation over the same period. The level of the minimum is significantly
deeper in the p-mode frequencies than in the surface observations. We observe a
quasi-biennial signal in the p-mode frequencies, which has not previously been
observed at mid- and low-activity levels. The stark differences in the behavior
of the frequencies and the surface activity measures point to activity-related
processes occurring in the solar interior, which are yet to reach the surface,
where they may be attenuated.

period can be ascertained by minimizing the dynamic heights of the 100 mbar
isosurface with respect to the geoid; they derived a rotation period of 10h 32m
35s. We investigate the same approach for Jupiter to see if the Jovian rotation
period is predicted by minimizing the dynamical heights of its isobaric (1 bar
pressure level) surface using zonal wind data. A rotation period of 9h 54m 29s
is found. Further, we investigate the minimization method by fitting Pioneer
and Voyager occultation radii for both Jupiter and Saturn. Rotation periods of
9h 55m 30s and 10h 32m 35s are found to minimize the dynamical heights for
Jupiter and Saturn, respectively. Though there is no dynamical principle
requiring the minimization of the dynamical heights of an isobaric surface, the
successful application of the method to Jupiter lends support to its relevance
for Saturn. We derive Jupiter and Saturn rotation periods using equilibrium
theory in which the solid-body rotation period (no winds) that gives the
observed equatorial and polar radii at the 100 mbar level is found. Rotation
periods of 9h 55m 20s and 10h 31m 49s are found for Jupiter and Saturn,

using solid-body rotation, suggesting that zonal winds have a minor effect on
the planetary shape for both planets. The agreement in the values of Saturn's
rotation period predicted by the different approaches supports the conclusion
that the planet's period of rotation is about 10h 32m.

tool to detect nanomagnetism. Conductance reflects magnetism through anomalies
at zero bias -- generally with Fano lineshapes -- due to the Kondo screening of
the magnetic impurity bridging the contact. A full atomic-level understanding
of this nutshell many-body system is of the greatest importance, especially in
view of our increasing need to control nanocurrents by means of magnetism.
Disappointingly, zero bias conductance anomalies are not presently calculable
from atomistic scratch. In this Letter we demonstrate a working route
connecting approximately but quantitatively density functional theory (DFT) and
numerical renormalization group (NRG) approaches and leading to a
first-principles conductance calculation for a nanocontact, exemplified by a Ni
impurity in a Au nanowire. A Fano-like conductance lineshape is obtained
microscopically, and shown to be controlled by the impurity s-level position.
We also find a relationship between conductance anomaly and geometry, and
uncover the possibility of opposite antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic Kondo
screening -- the latter exhibiting a totally different and unexplored zero bias
anomaly. The present matching method between DFT and NRG should permit the
quantitative understanding and exploration of this larger variety of Kondo
phenomena at more general magnetic nanocontacts.

sparse coding algorithm. Given a set of spectra of different classes, i.e. with
different positions and heights of the peaks, this procedure can extract peaks
by means of unsupervised learning. Instead of an $l_1$-regularization penalty
term used in the original sparse coding algorithm we propose using an
elastic-net penalty term for better regularization. The evaluation is done by
means of simulation. We show that for a large region of parameters the proposed
peak picking method based on the sparse coding features outperforms a mean
spectrum-based method. Moreover, we demonstrate the procedure applying it to
two real-life datasets.
