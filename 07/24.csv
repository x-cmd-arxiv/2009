in the absence of new weak phases in decay. The result is a model-independent
expression relating CP violation in mixing, CP violation in the interference of
decays with and without mixing, and the meson mass and width differences. It
relates the semileptonic and time-dependent CP asymmetries; and CP-conjugate
pairs of time-dependent $D^0$ CP asymmetries. CP violation in the interference
of decays with and without mixing is related to the mixing parameters of
relevance to model building: the off-diagonal mixing matrix elements |M12|,
|Gamma12|, and phi12 = arg(M12 /Gamma12). Incorporating this relation into a
fit to the D0 -\overline{D0} mixing data implies a level of sensitivity to
|phiD12| of 0.10 [rad] at 1 sigma. The formalism is extended to include new
weak phases in decay, and in Gamma12. The phases are highly constrained by
direct CP violation measurements. Consequently, the bounds on |phiD12| are not
significantly altered, and the effects of new weak phases in decay could be
difficult to observe at a high luminosity flavor factory (D0) or at the LHC
(Bs) via violations of the above relations, unlike in direct CP violation.

Analyzing R-symmetric models, we point out that while some of the known
messenger models clearly prefer the supersymmetric vacuum, there is a vast
class of models where the answer depends on the initial conditions. Along with
the vacuum at the origin, the high temperature thermal potential also possesses
a local minimum far away from the origin. This vacuum has no analog at zero
temperature. The first order phase transition from this vacuum into the
supersymmetric vacuum is parametrically suppressed, and the theory, starting
from that vacuum, is likely to evolve to the desired gauge-mediation vacuum. We
also comment on the thermal evolution of models without R-symmetry.

particularly those with prompt photons, the data have begun to constrain the
allowed parameter space. Although significant modeling and background
uncertainties remain, we explore how large a signal is permitted by the current

any such asymmetry to be less than about 10^-7. First we consider contributions
to the inertial masses of atoms that encode the presence of antimatter and use
precision Eotvos experiments to establish the level at which they satisfy the
equivalence principle. In particular we focus on vacuum polarization effects
and the antiquark content of nucleons. Second we consider a class of theories
that contain long range scalar and vector forces that cancel with one another
to some high precision. By construction such theories would be able to evade
detection in Eotvos experiments that utilize matter while still allowing for a
signal in antimatter experiments. Even taking such cancellation for granted,
however, we show that the radiative damping of binary pulsar systems constrains
these forces to be significantly weaker than gravity. Furthermore we show that
there are limits to the accuracy with which such cancellation can be arranged:
first by determining the precision to which scalar charges can track vector
charges in the best candidate theories; and, second, by showing that the
different velocity dependence of scalar and vector forces necessarily
introduces non-cancellation at a quantifiable level.

independent results for the collisional energy loss dE/dx and the transport
coefficient q-hat. The latter is found to receive a sizable contribution from a
power-law tail in the transverse momentum distribution of high-momentum
partons. We further argue that the effect of instabilities on jet broadening
should be accessible by experiment when employing jet cones with elliptical
bases or studying correlations within the cone in full jet reconstruction
methods.

applied in such analyses is that the observed correlations arise from either
jets and associated hard scattering phenomena, or from a background component
due to combinatorial pairs connected only through whole even correlations.
Within this assumption of two essentially independent sources, a fundamental
problem centers around determining the relative contributions of each
component. We discuss the methods commonly used to establish the background
yield in jet correlation analyses, with a full explanation of the absolute
background normalization technique which establishes the background yield
without assumptions about the shape of jet correlations. This is especially
important in relativistic heavy ion collisions where the jet shapes are
significantly distorted from the well separated back-to-back di-jets observed

concentrated in particular on feed-forward loops (FFL), in which a master
transcription factor regulates a microRNA, and together with it, a set of joint
target protein coding genes. The circuits were assembled with a two step
procedure. We first constructed separately the transcriptional and
post-transcriptional components of the human regulatory network by looking for
conserved over-represented motifs in human and mouse promoters, and 3'-UTRs.
Then, we combined the two subnetworks looking for mixed feed-forward regulatory
interactions, finding a total of 638 putative (merged) FFLs. In order to
investigate their biological relevance, we filtered these circuits using three
selection criteria: (I) GeneOntology enrichment among the joint targets of the
FFL, (II) independent computational evidence for the regulatory interactions of
the FFL, extracted from external databases, and (III) relevance of the FFL in
cancer. Most of the selected FFLs seem to be involved in various aspects of
organism development and differentiation. We finally discuss a few of the most
interesting cases in detail.

computation of self-energies introduced by different types of electrodes
attached to the central region; and (iii) accelerated algorithms for NEGF

simulations. The IILM reduces field theory to a molecular dynamics description,
and for `physical' quark masses the system behaves like a strongly associating
fluid. We will argue that this is a generic feature for very light Dirac quark
in a non-trivial background, described in the semi-classical approach. To get
rid of unnecessary complications, we will present the ideas of biased Monte
Carlo, and implement the transition probabilities, for a toy model.

the hot dust as an additional base element were used for the first time in this

Part of the W{Na I 2.21 microns} and W {CO 2.3 microns} strengths may be
related to galaxy inclination. Our synthesis shows significant differences
between Sy 1 and Sy 2 galaxies: the hot dust component is required to fit the
K-band spectra of ~90% of the Sy 1 galaxies, and only of ~25% of the Sy 2;
about 50 % of the Sy 2 galaxies require a $FC$ component contribution >20%,
while this fraction increases to 60% in the Sy 1; also, in about 50 % of the
Sy2, the combined FC and young components contribute with more than 20%, while
this occurs in 90% of the Sy1, suggesting recent star formation in the central
region. The central few hundred parsecs of our galaxy sample contain a
substantial fraction of intermediate-age SPs with a mean metallicity near
solar. Our SP synthesis confirms that the 1.1 micron CN band can be used as a
tracer of intermediate-age SPs. The simultaneous fitting of SP, FC and hot dust
components increased in ~150% the number of AGNs with hot dust detected and the
mass estimated. The NIR emerges as an excellent window to study the stellar
population of Sy 1 galaxies, as opposed to the usually heavily attenuated

5921+0638 by studying its photometric, spectroscopic and physical properties.
We completed both an environmental analysis and detailed analytical and
grid-based mass modeling of the system. We measured the redshifts of the
lensing galaxy in COSMOS 5921+0638 (z_l=0.551+/-0.001) and 9 additional
galaxies in the field (5 of them at z~0.35). The redshift of the lensed source
was inferred by identifying a candidate Lya line at z_s=3.14+/-0.05. The mass
modeling reveals the requirement of a small external shear (gamma=0.038), which
is slightly larger than the lensing contribution expected by galaxy groups
along the line-of-sight (kappa_groups~0.01 and gamma_groups~0.005). The
estimated time-delays between the different images are of the order of hours to
half a week and the total magnification of the background source is mu~150. The
measured mass-to-light ratio of the lensing galaxy within the Einstein ring is
M/L_B~8.5+/-1.6. Our analysis indicates that the ring and point-like structures
in COSMOS 5921+0638 consist of a lensed high redshift galaxy hosting a low
luminosity AGN (LLAGN). Flux ratio anomalies observed in the lensed AGN images
are probably due to microlensing by stars in the lensing galaxy and/or a
combination of static phenomena. Because of its short time-delays and the
possibility of microlensing, COSMOS 5921+0638 is a promising laboratory for
future studies of LLAGNs.

For various types of weight functions which enter the hopping rates, we
determine the shape of the condensate, its scaling with the system size, and
the single-site mass distribution as characteristic static properties. As it
turns out, the condensate's shape and its scaling are not universal, but depend
on the competition between local and ultralocal interactions. So we can tune
the shape from a delta-like envelope to a parabolic-like or a rectangular one.
While we treat the liquid phase in the grand-canonical formalism, we develop a
different analytical approach for the condensed phase. Its predictions are well
confirmed by numerical simulations. Possible extensions to higher dimensions

the empirically known characteristics of symmetric nuclear matter are
reproduced at the saturation density. The thermodynamic characteristics of both

is an ordinary first-order phase transition described by Maxwell's rule, a
detailed study is made of the variations in the parameters of the phase
transition owing to the presence of a $\delta$-meson field. The quark phase is
described using an improved version of the bag model, in which interactions
between quarks are accounted for in a one-gluon exchange approximation. The
characteristics of the phase transition are determined for various values of
the bag parameter within the range $B\in[60,120]$ $MeV/fm^{3}$ and it is shown

""Green Peas"", first noted by volunteers in the Galaxy Zoo project because of
their peculiar bright green colour and small size, unresolved in SDSS imaging.
Their appearance is due to very strong optical emission lines, namely [O III]
5007 A, with an unusually large equivalent width of up to ~1000 A. We discuss a
well-defined sample of 251 colour-selected objects, most of which are strongly
star forming, although there are some AGN interlopers including 8 newly
discovered narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxies. The star-forming Peas are low mass
galaxies (M~10^8.5 - 10^10 M_sun) with high star formation rates (~10
M_sun/yr), low metallicities (log[O/H] + 12 ~ 8.7) and low reddening (E(B-V) <
0.25) and they reside in low density environments. They have some of the
highest specific star formation rates (up to ~10^{-8} yr^{-1}) seen in the
local Universe, yielding doubling times for their stellar mass of hundreds of
Myrs. The few star-forming Peas with HST imaging appear to have several clumps
of bright star-forming regions and low surface density features that may
indicate recent or ongoing mergers. The Peas are similar in size, mass,
luminosity and metallicity to Luminous Blue Compact Galaxies. They are also
similar to high redshift UV-luminous galaxies, e.g., Lyman-break galaxies and
Lyman-alpha emitters, and therefore provide a local laboratory with which to
study the extreme star formation processes that occur in high-redshift
galaxies. Studying starbursting galaxies as a function of redshift is essential
to understanding the build up of stellar mass in the Universe.

Dye et al. (2009) we presented the catalogue of sources detected at 5-sigma in
at least one band in this field and the probable counterparts to these sources
in other wavebands. In this paper, we present the results of a redshift survey
in which we succeeded in measuring redshifts for 82 of these counterparts. The
spectra show that the BLAST counterparts are mostly star-forming galaxies but
not extreme ones when compared to those found in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
Roughly one quarter of the BLAST counterparts contain an active nucleus. We
have used the spectroscopic redshifts to carry out a test of the ability of
photometric redshift methods to estimate the redshifts of dusty galaxies,
showing that the standard methods work well even when a galaxy contains a large
amount of dust. We have also investigated the cases where there are two
possible counterparts to the BLAST source, finding that in at least half of
these there is evidence that the two galaxies are physically associated, either
because they are interacting or because they are in the same large-scale
structure. Finally, we have made the first direct measurements of the
luminosity function in the three BLAST bands. We find strong evolution out to
z=1, in the sense that there is a large increase in the space-density of the
most luminous galaxies. We have also investigated the evolution of the
dust-mass function, finding similar strong evolution in the space-density of
the galaxies with the largest dust masses, showing that the luminosity
evolution seen in many wavebands is associated with an increase in the
reservoir of interstellar matter in galaxies.

a complex evolution and in most cases do not track each other. This behaviour
can not be easily explained by the simplest standard afterglow models. A
possible interpretation is to consider the observed optical and X-ray
light-curves as the sum of two separate components. This scenario requires the
presence of a spectral break between these bands. One of the aims of this work
is to test whether such a break is present within the observed Swift XRT energy
range. We analyse the X-ray afterglow spectra of a sample of 33 long GRBs with
known redshift, good optical photometry and published estimate of the host
galaxy dust absorption A_V(host). We find that indeed in 7 bright events a
broken power-law provides a fit to the data that is better than a single
power-law model. For 8 events, instead, the X-ray spectrum is better fitted by
a single power-law. We discuss the role of these breaks in connection to the
relation between the host hydrogen column density N_H(host) and A_V(host) and
check the consistency of the X-ray spectral breaks with the optical bands
photometry. We analyse the optical to X-ray spectral energy distributions at

temperature gauge theories beyond the leading order hard thermal loop (HTL)
approximation, we calculate the two-loop electron proper self-energy in high
temperature QED. The two-loop bubble diagram contains a linear infrared
divergence. Even if regulated with a non-zero photon mass M of order of the
Debye mass, this infrared sensitivity implies that the two-loop self-energy
contributes terms to the fermion dispersion relation that are comparable to or
even larger than the next-to-leading-order (NLO) contributions at one-loop.
Additional evidence for the necessity of a systematic restructuring of the loop
expansion comes from the explicit gauge parameter dependence of the fermion
damping rate at both one and two-loops. The leading terms in the high
temperature expansion of the two-loop self-energy for all topologies arise from
an explicit hard-soft factorization pattern, in which one of the loop integrals
is hard, nested inside a second loop integral which is soft. There are no
hard-hard contributions to the two-loop Sigma at leading order at high T.
Provided the same factorization pattern holds for arbitrary ell loops, the NLO
high temperature contributions to the electron self-energy come from ell-1 hard
loops factorized with one soft loop integral. This hard-soft pattern is both a
necessary condition for the resummation over ell to coincide with the one-loop
self-energy calculated with HTL dressed propagators and vertices, and to yield
the complete NLO correction to the self-energy at scales ~eT, which is both
infrared finite and gauge invariant. We employ spectral representations and the
Gaudin method for evaluating finite temperature Matsubara sums, which
facilitates the analysis of multi-loop diagrams at high T.

galaxies are linearly correlated over a very wide range in star formation rate,
from normal spirals like the Milky Way to the most intense starbursts. Using
one-zone models of cosmic ray (CR) injection, cooling, and escape in
star-forming galaxies, we attempt to reproduce the observed FIR-radio
correlation over its entire span. We show that ~2% of the kinetic energy from
supernova explosions must go into primary CR electrons and that ~10 - 20% must
go into primary CR protons. Secondary electrons and positrons are likely
comparable to or dominate primary electrons in dense starburst galaxies. We
discuss the implications of our models for the magnetic field strengths of
starbursts, the detectability of starbursts by Fermi, and cosmic ray feedback.
Overall, our models indicate that both CR protons and electrons escape from low
surface density galaxies, but lose most of their energy before escaping dense
starbursts. The FIR-radio correlation is caused by a combination of the
efficient cooling of CR electrons (calorimetry) in starbursts and a conspiracy
of several factors. For lower surface density galaxies, the decreasing radio
emission caused by CR escape is balanced by the decreasing FIR emission caused
by the low effective UV dust opacity. In starbursts, bremsstrahlung,
ionization, and Inverse Compton cooling decrease the radio emission, but they
are countered by secondary electrons/positrons and the decreasing critical
synchrotron frequency, which both increase the radio emission. Our conclusions
hold for a broad range of variations on our fiducial model.

sequential all-pay mechanism is a 4 approximation to the revenue of the optimal
ex-interim truthful mechanism with discrete correlated type space for each
bidder. We also show that a sequential posted price mechanism is a O(1)
approximation to the revenue of the optimal ex-post truthful mechanism when the
type space of each bidder is a product distribution that satisfies the standard
hazard rate condition. We further show a logarithmic approximation when the
hazard rate condition is removed, and complete the picture by showing that
achieving a sub-logarithmic approximation, even for regular distributions and
one bidder, requires pricing bundles of items. Our results are based on
formulating novel LP relaxations for these problems, and developing generic
rounding schemes from first principles. We believe this approach will be useful
in other Bayesian mechanism design contexts.

generalizations of instantons with nontrivial scalar fields turned on, and
satisfy some constraints that bear a similarity with the Hitchin equations, and
contain the Donaldson equations as a special subcase. It turns out that these
constraints can be obtained by dimensional reduction of the octonionic
instanton equations, and may be rephrased in terms of a selfduality-like
condition for a complex connection. We also show that the supersymmetry
conditions imply the equations of motion only partially.

evaluations of the nuclear overlap function ($T_{AB}$) and number of binary
collisions ($N_{coll}$) is studied. A narrowing of the spatial distribution of
the hard-partons with large light-cone fraction $x$ in nucleons leads to a
downward correction for $N_{coll}$ and $T_{AB}$, which in turn, results in an
upward correction for the nuclear modification factor $R_{AB}$. The size of
this correction is estimated for several experimentally motivated
nucleon-nucleon overlap functions for hard-partons. It is found to be
significant in peripheral nucleus-nucleus and nucleon-nucleus collisions, and
are much larger at the LHC energy of $\sqrt{s}=5.5$ TeV than for the RHIC
energy of $\sqrt{s}$=200 GeV. The implications for experimental measurements
are also discussed.

  The approach taken in these notes is to focus on semilinear parabolic
problems driven by additive noise. These can be treated as stochastic evolution
equations in some infinite-dimensional Banach or Hilbert space that usually
have nice regularising properties and they already form a very rich class of
problems with many interesting properties. Furthermore, this class of problems
has the advantage of allowing to completely pass under silence many subtle
problems arising from stochastic integration in infinite-dimensional spaces.

most likely be a multipurpose facility. The main physics justification for such
a device is detection of accelerator generated neutrinos, nucleon decay, and
natural sources of neutrinos such as solar, atmospheric and supernova
neutrinos. In addition to the physics justification there are practical issues
regarding the existing infrastructure at Homestake, and the stress
characteristics of the Homestake rock formations.
  The depth requirements associated with the various physics processes are
reported for water Cherenkov and liquid argon detector technologies. While some
of these physics processes can be adequately studied at shallower depths, none
of them require a depth greater than 4300 mwe which corresponds to the 4850 ft
level at Homestake. It is very important to note that the scale of the planned
detector is such that even for accelerator neutrino detection (which allows one
to use the accelerator duty factor to eliminate cosmics) a minimum depth is
needed to reduce risk of contamination from cosmic rays. After consideration of
the science and the practical issues regarding the Homestake site, we strongly
recommend that the geotechnical studies be commenced at the 4850ft level in a

graphitization of hexagonal SiC surfaces provides a viable alternative for the
synthesis of graphene, with wafer-size epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001) now
possible. Despite this recent progress, the exact nature of the graphene-SiC
interface and whether the graphene even has a semiconducting gap remain
controversial. Using scanning tunneling microscopy with functionalized tips and
density functional theory calculations, here we show that the interface is a
warped carbon sheet consisting of three-fold hexagon-pentagon-heptagon
complexes periodically inserted into the honeycomb lattice. These defects
relieve the strain between the graphene layer and the SiC substrate, while
still retaining the three-fold coordination for each carbon atom. Moreover,
these defects break the six-fold symmetry of the honeycomb, thereby naturally
inducing a gap: the calculated band structure of the interface is
semiconducting and there are two localized states near K below the Fermi level,
explaining the photoemission and carbon core-level data. Nonlinear dispersion
and a 33 meV gap are found at the Dirac point for the next layer of graphene,
providing insights into the debate over the origin of the gap in epitaxial
graphene on SiC(0001). These results indicate that the interface of the
epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001) is more than a dead buffer layer, but actively
impacts the physical and electronic properties of the subsequent graphene
layers.

are introduced to supply the heavy seesaw masses. To detect the signals of
these heavy triplet leptons, one needs to understand their decays to standard
model particles which depend on how light and heavy leptons mix with each
other. We concentrate on the usual solutions with small light and heavy lepton
mixing of order the square root of the ratio of light and heavy masses,
(m_\nu/M_{\nu_R})^{1/2}. This class of solutions can lead to a visible
displaced vertex detectable at the LHC which can be used to distinguish small
mixing and large mixing between light and heavy leptons. We show that, in this
case, the couplings of light and heavy triplet leptons to gauge and Higgs
bosons, which determine the decay widths and branching ratios, can be expressed
in terms of light neutrino masses and their mixing. Using these relations, we
study heavy triplet lepton decay patterns and production cross section at the
LHC. If these heavy triplet leptons are below a TeV or so, they can be easily
produced at the LHC due to their gauge interactions from being non-trivial
representations of SU(2)_L. We consider two ideal production channels, 1)
E^+E^- \to \ell^+\ell^+ \ell^-\ell^- jj (\ell=e,\mu,\tau) and 2) E^\pm N \to

evolution of the binary fraction in globular clusters. In agreement with
previous N-body simulations, we find generally that the hard binary fraction in
the core tends to increase with time over a range of initial cluster central
densities for initial binary fractions <~ 90%. The dominant processes driving
the evolution of the core binary fraction are mass segregation of binaries into
the cluster core and preferential destruction of binaries there. On a global
scale, these effects and the preferential tidal stripping of single stars tend
to roughly balance, leading to overall cluster binary fractions that are
roughly constant with time. Our findings suggest that the current hard binary
fraction near the half-mass radius is a good indicator of the hard primordial
binary fraction. However, the relationship between the true binary fraction and
the fraction of main-sequence stars in binaries (which is typically what
observers measure) is non-linear and rather complicated. We also consider the
importance of soft binaries, which not only modify the evolution of the binary
fraction, but can drastically change the evolution of the cluster as a whole.
Finally, we describe in some detail the recent addition of single and binary
stellar evolution to our cluster evolution code.

detection is non-optimal for particle sensing in optical tweezers and propose
an alternative optimal particle sensing scheme based on spatial homodyne

interaction modeled on the Bonn potential. Leading GSC contributions, at first
order in the residual strong interaction, are introduced on the same footing

characterized by the effective media theory at the early stage. However, the
effective media model does not take into account the interactions between
magnetic elements; thus, the effective properties of bulk metamaterials are the
result of the ""averaged effect"" of many uncoupled resonators. In recent years,
it has been shown that the interaction between magnetic resonators could lead
to some novel phenomena and interesting applications that do not exist in
conventional uncoupled metamaterials. In this paper, we will give a review of
recent developments in magnetic plasmonics arising from the coupling effect in
metamaterials. For the system composed of several identical magnetic
resonators, the coupling between these units produces multiple discrete
resonance modes due to hybridization. In the case of a system comprising an
infinite number of magnetic elements, these multiple discrete resonances can be
extended to form a continuous frequency band by strong coupling. This kind of
broadband and tunable magnetic metamaterial may have interesting applications.
Many novel metamaterials and nanophotonic devices could be developed from
coupled resonator systems in the future.

allow direct comparison in hopes of isolating the cause of the differences, we
here present a high resolution three-dimensional hydrodynamics simulation of a

instead quickly settles into a state with only low amplitude nonaxisymmetric
structure, which persists for at least several outer disk rotations. We see no
rapid radiative or convective cooling. We conclude that the differences in

three-dimensional XY spin glass with resistively-shunted junction dynamics for
sample sizes up to $64^3$. It is observed that the linear resistivity at low
temperatures tends to zero, providing a strong evidence of a finite temperature
phase-coherence (i.e. spin-glass) transition. Dynamical scaling analysis
demonstrates that a perfect collapse of current-voltage data can be achieved.
The obtained critical exponents agree with those in equilibrium Monte Carlo
simulations, and are compatible with those observed in various experiments on
high-T$_c$ cuprate superconductors. It is suggested that the spin and the
chirality order simultaneously. A genuine continuous depinning transition is
found at zero temperature. For low temperature creep motion, critical exponents
are evaluated, and a non-Arrhenius creep motion is observed in the low
temperature ordered phase. It is proposed that the XY spin glass gives an
effective description of the transport properties in high-T$_c$ superconductors
with d-wave symmetry.

particle-in-cell simulations of a local flux tube in shifted-circle tokamak

this system retains a disordered fluorite crystal structure and the vacancy

increasing disorder with increasing Nb5+ content were reproduced in simulations
with the cations randomly assigned to positions on the cation sublattice. The

and their effect on vacancy ordering by carrying out additional calculations in
which, for example, the charges of the cations were equalised. The simulations
did not, however, reproduce all the observed properties, particularly for
Y3NbO7. Its conductivity was significantly overestimated and prominent diffuse
scattering features observed in small area electron diffraction studies were
not always reproduced. Consideration of these deficiencies led to a preliminary
attempt to characterise the consequence of partially ordering the cations on

which in most cases can be described with a blackbody model, above the main
power-law component. While in the high-luminosity sources it is usually
characterized by low temperature (kT < 0.5 keV) and large emission radius (R >
100 km), in the two persistent and low-luminosity pulsars 4U 0352+309 and RX
J0146.9+6121 this component has a high temperature (kT > 1 keV) and a smaller
radius (R < 0.5 km), consistent with the estimated size of the neutron-star
polar cap. Here we report on the timing and spectral analysis of RX
J1037.5-5647, another low-luminosity persistent Be binary pulsar, based on the
first XMM-Newton observation of this source. We have found a best-fit period P
= 853.4(+/-0.2) s, that implies an average pulsar spin-up dP/dt ~ -2E-8 s/s in
the latest decade. The estimated source luminosity is Lx ~ 10^34 erg/s, a value
comparable to that of the other persistent Be binary pulsars and about one
order of magnitude lower than in most of the previous measurements. The source
spectrum can be described with a power law plus blackbody model, with kTbb =
1.26(+0.16/-0.09) keV and Rbb = 128(+13/-21) m, suggesting a polar-cap origin
of this component. These results strengthen the hypothesis that, in addition to
low luminosities and long periods, this class of sources is characterized also
by common spectral properties

proposed. The rates of dissipation have no predetermined spectral shapes and
are functions of the wave spectrum and wind speed and direction, in a way
consistent with observation of wave breaking and swell dissipation properties.
Namely, the swell dissipation is nonlinear and proportional to the swell
steepness, and dissipation due to wave breaking is non-zero only when a
non-dimensional spectrum exceeds the threshold at which waves are observed to
start breaking. An additional source of short wave dissipation due to long wave
breaking is introduced to represent the dissipation of short waves due to
longer breaking waves. Several degrees of freedom are introduced in the wave
breaking and the wind-wave generation term of Janssen (J. Phys. Oceanogr.
1991). These parameterizations are combined and calibrated with the Discrete
Interaction Approximation of Hasselmann et al. (J. Phys. Oceangr. 1985) for the
nonlinear interactions. Parameters are adjusted to reproduce observed shapes of
directional wave spectra, and the variability of spectral moments with wind
speed and wave height. The wave energy balance is verified in a wide range of
conditions and scales, from gentle swells to major hurricanes, from the global
ocean to coastal settings. Wave height, peak and mean periods, and spectral
data are validated using in situ and remote sensing data. Some systematic
defects are still present, but the parameterizations yield the best overall
results to date. Perspectives for further improvement are also given.

nonrelativistic Hamiltonian systems can be described as geodesic flows on a
manifold and an associated dual. This method can be applied to a four
dimensional manifold of orbits in spacetime associated with a relativistic
system. We show that a relativistic Hamiltonian which generates Einstein
geodesics, with the addition of a world scalar field, can be put into
correspondence with another Hamiltonian with conformally modified metric. Such
a construction could account for part of the requirements of Bekenstein for
achieving the MOND theory of Milgrom in the post-Newtonian limit. The
constraints on the MOND theory imposed by the galactic rotation curves, through
this correspondence, would then imply constraints on the structure of the world
scalar field. We then use the fact that a Hamiltonian with vector gauge fields
results, through such a conformal map, in a Kaluza-Klein type theory, and
indicate how the TeVeS structure of Bekenstein and Sanders can be put into this
framework. We exhibit a class of infinitesimal gauge transformations on the
gauge fields ${\cal U}_\mu$ which preserve the Bekenstein-Sanders condition
${\cal U}_\mu {\cal U}^\mu = -1$. The underlying quantum structure giving rise
to these gauge fields is a Hilbert bundle, and the gauge transformations induce
a non-commutative behavior to the fields, i.e., they become of Yang-Mills type.
Working in the infinitesimal gauge neighborhood of the initial Abelian theory,
we show that in the Abelian limit the Yang-Mills field equations provide
nonlinear terms which may avoid the caustic singularity found by Contaldi, et
al.

systems to decompose the multi-queue system into independent first-in-first-out
(FIFO) queues, which are hinged together by the probability of success of
head-of-line (HOL) packets. A unified method is devised to tackle the stability

demonstrate that a network with K-Exponential Backoff can be stabilized if the

characterized and illustrated via examples of Geometric Retransmission (K=1)
and Exponential Backoff (K=infinity). With an increasing number of nodes n, we
show that the stable region of Geometric Retransmission rapidly shrinks, and
vanishes as n goes to infinity. In contrast, the stable region of Exponential
Backoff does not vary with the network population n, implying that a stable
throughput can be achieved in networks with Exponential Backoff even with an
infinite number of nodes. All the analytical results presented in this paper

photometry between 1.6 and 8 mu, from 2MASS and Spitzer, and based on X-ray
detected sources from a Chandra observation. This sample is composed of 26
Class II and 25 Class III candidates. The sample is estimated to be complete
down to ~ 0.5 solar masses. The most restricted and least biased sub-sample of
pre-main sequence stars is composed of lightly absorbed (A_V < 5 mag) stars in
the cluster core. This sample comprises 7 Class II and 14 Class III sources, it
has a disk fraction of 33^{+24}_{-19} %, and a median X-ray luminosity of log

selection, absorption, mass distribution, distance and, consequently, the
computation of disk fraction and X-ray luminosities, the data yield consistent

rise to a rich variety of phase diagrams. The phase diagrams are classified by
means of the energy scale Lambda_{z}, which is defined as the bilayer splitting

incurred with Geometric Retransmission when the aggregate input rate is small,
and the delay gap is enlarged as the number of nodes n increases. With a high

severely deteriorates. The mean queueing delay will be unbounded if the

  We also extend the analysis to the contention-window-based backoff model

larger transverse momenta, leading to a peaking and subsequent decrease of the
elliptic flow at fixed p_T with increasing collision energy, independent of
whether or not there is a phase transition in the equation of state.

criticality for inhomogeneous random graphs when the degree exponent $\tau$
satisfies $\tau>4$. We see that the sizes of the (rescaled) components converge
to the excursion lengths of an inhomogeneous Brownian motion, extending results
of \cite{Aldo97}. We rely heavily on martingale convergence techniques, and
concentration properties of (super)martingales. This paper is part of a
programme to study the critical behavior in inhomogeneous random graphs of
so-called rank-1 initiated in \cite{Hofs09a}.

singularity is critically reviwed. Quantum effects, playing the essential role
at the very early stages, suggests that the universe may follow different
course to that presented by the standard Friedmann solutions. The investigation
of the back-reaction effect of the vacuum energy of quantized massless matter
fields at finite temperatures shows that the original spatial singularity is
avoided and that the universe is maintained all times at a critical density.
Instead of having a universe that was created at once we have an emergent
universe with energy being created continuously so as to maintain the overall
density at its critical value. The calculations presented here provide a basis
to construct a dynamical model for the universe where all the known problems of
the standard big bang can be avioded from start without the need to assume the
occurence of an inflation phase.

nowhere dense and closed under induced subgraphs. This generalises known
results about the dominating set problem on H-minor free classes, classes with
locally excluded minors and classes of graphs of bounded expansion. A key
feature of our proof is that it is based simply on the fact that these graph
classes are uniformly quasi-wide, and does not rely on a structural

These dragon-kings reveal the existence of mechanisms of self-organization that
are not apparent otherwise from the distribution of their smaller siblings. We
present a generic phase diagram to explain the generation of dragon-kings and
document their presence in six different examples (distribution of city sizes,
distribution of acoustic emissions associated with material failure,
distribution of velocity increments in hydrodynamic turbulence, distribution of
financial drawdowns, distribution of the energies of epileptic seizures in
humans and in model animals, distribution of the earthquake energies). We
emphasize the importance of understanding dragon-kings as being often
associated with a neighborhood of what can be called equivalently a phase
transition, a bifurcation, a catastrophe (in the sense of Rene Thom), or a
tipping point. The presence of a phase transition is crucial to learn how to
diagnose in advance the symptoms associated with a coming dragon-king. Several
examples of predictions using the derived log-periodic power law method are

that the vdW-DF inclusion of nonlocal correlations (responsible for dispersive
interactions) changes the relative stability of eight binding-position options

agreement with experiment. The admolecules can move almost freely along a
honeycomb web of ""corridors"" passing between fcc and hcp hollow sites via
bridge sites. Our diffusion barriers (for dilute and two condensed adsorbate
phases) are consistent with experimental observations. Further vdW-DF
calculations suggest that the more compact (hexagonal) Bz-overlayer phase, with
lattice constant a = 6.74 \AA, is due to direct Bz-Bz vdW attraction, which
extends to ~8 \AA. We attribute the second, sparser hexagonal Bz phase, with a
= 10.24 \AA, to indirect electronic interactions mediated by the metallic
surface state on Cu(111). To support this claim, we use a formal
Harris-functional approach to evaluate nonperturbationally the asymptotic form

that the Hot DQ white dwarfs SDSS J220029.08-074121.5 and SDSS
J234843.30-094245.3 are luminosity variable. These are the second and third
known members of a new class of pulsating white dwarfs, after the prototype
SDSS J142625.71+575218.3 (Montgomery et al. 2008). We find that the light curve
of SDSS J220029.08-074121.5 is dominated by an oscillation at 654.397+-0.056 s,
and that the light pulse folded on that period is highly nonlinear due to the
presence of the first and second harmonic of the main pulsation. We also
present evidence for the possible detection of two additional pulsation modes
with low amplitudes and periods of 577.576+-0.226 s and 254.732+-0.048 s in
that star. Likewise, we find that the light curve of SDSS J234843.30-094245.3
is dominated by a pulsation with a period of 1044.168+-0.012 s, but with no
sign of harmonic components. A new oscillation, with a low amplitude and a
period of 416.919+-0.004 s, is also probably detected in that second star. We
argue, on the basis of the very different folded pulse shapes, that SDSS
J220029.08-074121.5 is likely magnetic, while SDSS J234843.30-094245.3 is
probably not.

consistent with the binary period, with the emission being modulated at 26.6
+/- 0.5 days. This constitutes the first detection of orbital periodicity in
high-energy gamma rays (20 MeV-100 GeV, HE). The light curve is characterized
by a broad peak after periastron, as well as a smaller peak just before
apastron. The spectrum is best represented by a power law with an exponential
cutoff, yielding an overall flux above 100 MeV of 0.82 +/- 0.03(stat) +/-

There is no significant spectral change with orbital phase. The phase of
maximum emission, close to periastron, hints at inverse Compton scattering as
the main radiation mechanism. However, previous very high-energy gamma ray
(>100 GeV, VHE) observations by MAGIC and VERITAS show peak emission close to
apastron. This and the energy cutoff seen with Fermi suggest the link between

adopt two successful chemical evolution models for the bulge and the disk,
which assume the same nucleosynthesis prescriptions but different histories of
star formation. The data show a clear distinction between the trend of [C/O] in
the thick and thin Galactic disks, while the thick disk and bulge trends are
indistinguishable with a large (>0.5 dex) increase in the C/O ratio in the
range from -0.1 to +0.4 dex for [O/H]. In our models we consider yields from
massive stars with and without the inclusion of metallicity-dependent stellar
winds. The observed increase in the [C/O] ratio with metallicity in the bulge
and thick disk lies between the predictions utilizing the mass-loss rates of
Maeder (1992) and those of Meynet & Maeder (2002). A model without
metallicity-dependent yields completely fails to match the observations. Thus,
the relative increase in carbon abundance at high metallicity appears to be due
to metallicity-dependent stellar winds in massive stars. These results also
explain the steep decline of the [O/Fe] ratio with [Fe/H] in the Galactic
bulge, while the [Mg/Fe] ratio is enhanced at all [Fe/H]. (abridged)

problem: In each iteration, the algorithm finds among the unpacked items, a
maximum size set of items that fits into a new bin. More than 35 years after
its first mention in the literature, establishing the worst-case performance of
this heuristic remains, surprisingly, an open problem.
  Due to their simplicity and intuitive appeal, greedy algorithms are the
heuristics of choice of many practitioners. Therefore, better understanding
simple greedy heuristics is, in general, an interesting topic in its own right.
Very recently, Epstein and Kleiman (Proc. ESA 2008) provided another incentive
to study the subset sum algorithm by showing that the Strong Price of Anarchy
of the game theoretic version of the bin-packing problem is precisely the
approximation ratio of this heuristic.
  In this paper we establish the exact approximation ratio of the subset sum
algorithm, thus settling a long standing open problem. We generalize this
result to the parametric variant of the bin packing problem where item sizes
lie on the interval (0,\alpha] for some \alpha \leq 1, yielding tight bounds
for the Strong Price of Anarchy for all \alpha \leq 1. Finally, we study the
pure Price of Anarchy of the parametric Bin Packing game for which we show
nearly tight upper and lower bounds for all \alpha \leq 1.

Great Attractor (GA) regions. The observations were conducted with the Parkes
64m radio telescope, in a single-pixel pointed mode, reaching an rms noise
level of typically 2-6 mJy over the velocity search range of 400<v<10500km/s. A
total of 162 galaxies were detected. This can be explained by the prominence of
the GA overdensity in the survey regions, which leads to a relatively higher
fraction of nearby galaxies. It is also evident from the quite narrow velocity
distribution (largely confined to 3000-6000km/s) and deviates significantly
from the expectation of a uniform galaxy distribution for the given sensitivity
and velocity range. No systematic differences were found between detections and
non-detections, in terms of latitude, foreground extinction, or environment,
except for the very central part of the rich Norma cluster, where hardly any
galaxies were detected. A detailed investigation of the HI content of the
galaxies reveals strong HI deficiency at the core of the Norma cluster (within
about a 0.4 Abell radius), similar to what has been found in the Coma cluster.
The redshifts obtained by this observing technique result in a substantial
reduction of the so-called redshift ZOA. This is obvious when analysing the
large-scale structure of the new HI data in combination with data from optical
ZOA redshift surveys. The lower latitude detections provide further evidence of
the extension of the Norma Wall, across the ZOA, in particular its bending
towards the Cen-Crux clusters above the Galactic plane at slightly higher
redshift, rather than a straight continuation towards the Centaurus clusters.

characterizing a system of three coupled Bose-Einstein condensates arranged
into an open-chain geometry. The boson interaction, the hopping amplitude and
the central-well relative depth are regarded as adjustable parameters. After
deriving the stability diagrams of the system, we identify three mechanisms to
realize the transition from an unstable to stable behavior and analyze specific
configurations that, by suitably tuning the model parameters, give rise to
macroscopic effects which are expected to be accessible to experimental
observation. Also, we pinpoint a system regime that realizes a
Josephson-junction-like effect. In this regime the system configuration do not
depend on the model interaction parameters, and the population oscillation
amplitude is related to the condensate-phase difference. This fact makes
possible estimating the latter quantity, since the measure of the oscillating
amplitudes is experimentally accessible.

and solar system objects within the framework of the baseline Gaia relativity
model (GREM) is discussed. Two refinements have been achieved with the goal to
improve the performance of the model: First, the quadrupole deflection formulas
for both cases are simplified as much as possible considering the Gaia nominal
orbit (only approximate minimal distances between Gaia and the giant planets
were used here), physical parameters of the giant planets and the envisaged
accuracy of 1 microarcsecond for individual systematic effects. The recommended
formulas are given by Eq.(40) for stars/quasars and by Eq.(81) for solar system
objects. Second, simple expressions for the upper estimate of the quadrupole
light deflection have been found allowing, with a few additional arithmetical
operations, to judge a priori if the quadrupole light deflection should be
computed or not for a given source and for a given requested accuracy. The
recommended criteria are given by Eq.(45) for stars/quasars and by Eq.(92) for
solar system objects. Additionally, the quadrupole Shapiro effect for solar
system objects is reconsidered. A strict upper bound of quadrupole Shapiro
effect for solar system objects is given in Eq.(109).

low-momentum transfer interactions in heavy-heavy and heavy-light quark
systems. We assume that the underlying potentials can be estimated from the
heavy-quark free energy computed in lattice QCD. We discuss constraints from
vacuum spectroscopy, uncertainties arising from different choices of the
potential, and the role of elastic and inelastic widths which are naturally

at its both sides is analyzed using DFT simulations of the SiC surface slabs of
different thickness. It is shown that for thicker slab the field is nonuniform
and this fact is related to the surface state charge. Using the electron
density and potential profiles it is proved that for high precision simulations
it is necessary to take into account enough number of the Si-C layers. We show
that using 12 diatomic layers leads to satisfactory results. It is also
demonstrated that the change of the opposite side slab termination, both by
different type of atoms or by their location, can be used to adjust electric
field within the slab, creating a tool for simulation of surface properties,
depending on the doping in the bulk of semiconductor. Using these simulations
it was found that, depending on the electric field, the energy of the surface
states changes in a different way than energy of the bulk states. This
criterion can be used to distinguish Shockley and Tamm surface states. The
electronic properties, i.e. energy and type of surface states of the three
