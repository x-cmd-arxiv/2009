Submillimeter Telescope (BLAST) made resolved maps of seven nearby (<25 Mpc)
galaxies at 250, 350, and 500 microns. During its June 2005 flight from Sweden,
BLAST observed a single nearby galaxy, NGC 4565. During the December 2006
flight from Antarctica, BLAST observed the nearby galaxies NGC 1097, NGC 1291,
NGC 1365, NGC 1512, NGC 1566, and NGC 1808. We fit physical dust models to a
combination of BLAST observations and other available data for the galaxies
observed by Spitzer. We fit a modified blackbody to the remaining galaxies to
obtain total dust mass and mean dust temperature. For the four galaxies with
Spitzer data, we also produce maps and radial profiles of dust column density
and temperature. We measure the fraction of BLAST detected flux originating
from the central cores of these galaxies and use this to calculate a ""core
fraction,"" an upper limit on the ""AGN fraction"" of these galaxies. We also find
our resolved observations of these galaxies give a dust mass estimate 5-19
times larger than an unresolved observations would predict. Finally, we are
able to use these data to derive a value for the dust mass absorption
co-efficient of kappa = 0.29 +/-0.03 m^2 kg^-1 at 250 microns. This study is an
introduction to future higher-resolution and higher-sensitivity studies to be
conducted by Herschel and SCUBA-II.

studied. Group Averaging is applied to define the Hilbert space of solutions
and the relational Dirac observables. Two cases are considered. In the first
case, the spectrum of the operator $(1/2)\pi^2 B - H$ is assumed to be
discrete. The quantum theory defined by the constraint takes the form of a
Schroedinger-like quantum mechanics with a generalized Hamiltonian
$\sqrt{B^{-1} H}$. In the second case, the spectrum is absolutely continuous
and some peculiar asymptotic properties of the eigenfunctions are assumed. The
resulting Hilbert space and the dynamics are characterized by a continuous
family of the Schroedinger-like quantum theories. However, the relational
observables mix different members of the family. Our assumptions are motivated
by new Loop Quantum Cosmology models of quantum FRW spacetime. The two cases

appropriate statistical model. The basic assumption is that there is an
irreducible uncertainty in the location of particles: positions constitute a
configuration space and the corresponding probability distributions constitute
a statistical manifold. The dynamics follows from a principle of inference, the
method of Maximum Entropy. The concept of time is introduced as a convenient
way to keep track of change. A welcome feature is that the entropic dynamics
notion of time incorporates a natural distinction between past and future. The
statistical manifold is assumed to be a dynamical entity: its curved and
evolving geometry determines the evolution of the particles which, in their
turn, react back and determine the evolution of the geometry. Imposing that the
dynamics conserve energy leads to the Schroedinger equation and to a natural
explanation of its linearity, its unitarity, and of the role of complex
numbers. The phase of the wave function is explained as a feature of purely
statistical origin. There is a quantum analogue to the gravitational
equivalence principle.

devoted to the solar like star HD49933.The eigenmodes of this F dwarf have been
observed with unprecedented accuracy.
  Aims : We investigate quantitatively the impact of changes in the modeling
parameters like mass and composition. More importantly we investigate how a
sophisticated physics affects the seismological picture of HD49933. We consider
the effects of diffusion, rotation and the changes in convection efficiency.
  Methods : We use the CESAM stellar evolution code coupled to the ADIPLS
adiabatic pulsation package to build secular models and their associated
oscillation frequencies. We also exploited the hydrodynamical code STAGGER to
perform surface convection calculations. The seismic variables used in this
work are : the large frequency separation, the derivative of the surface phase
shift,and the eigenfrequencies $\rm \nu_{\ell=0,n=14}$ and $\rm
\nu_{\ell=0,n=27}$.
  Results : Mass and uncertainties on the composition have much larger impacts
on the seismic variables we consider than the rotation. The derivative of the
surface phase shift is a promising variable for the determination of the helium
content. The seismological variables of HD49933 are sensitive to the assumed
solar composition and also to the presence of diffusion in the models.

spring surfaces and compressible internal pressure. The density of the inner

the inner layer can be opposite to the motion of the outer layer. These special

improved imitation of a soft body, such as tissue's liquidity non-uniform

kinematics. The median target magnitude was I_814=25.3, and total exposure
times ranged from 10 to 50 ks. We measure redshifts, some new, ranging from
z=0.2072 to z=4.056, including two interlopers at z<1, and resulting in a
sample of 14 LBGs with a median redshift z=2.424. The morphologies and
kinematics of the close pairs and multiple knot sources in our sample are
generally inconsistent with galaxy formation scenarios postulating that LBGs
occur only at the bottom of the potential wells of massive host halos; rather,
they support ``collisional starburst'' models with significant major merger
rates and a broad halo occupation distribution. For 13 LBGs with possible
kinematic signatures, we estimate simple dynamical masses ranging from 4e9 h^-1
M_sun to 1.1e11 h^-1 M_sun for individual galaxies and from <10e10 h^-1 to
~10^14 h^-1 M_sun with a median value 1e13 h^-1 M_sun for host dark matter
halos. Comparison with a recent numerical galaxy formation model implies that
the pairwise velocities might not reflect true dynamical masses. We compare our
dynamical mass estimates directly to stellar masses and find no evidence for a
strong correlation. The diversity of morphologies and dynamics implies that
LBGs represent a broad range of galaxy or proto-galaxy types in a variety of
evolutionary or merger stages rather than a uniform class with a narrow range
of mass.

crucial role in optical cluster detection. Measurement of the slope and scatter
of the red sequence are affected both by selection of red sequence galaxies and
measurement errors. In this paper, we describe a new error corrected Gaussian
Mixture Model for red sequence galaxy identification. Using this technique, we
can remove the effects of measurement error and extract unbiased information
about the intrinsic properties of the red sequence. We use this method to
select red sequence galaxies in each of the 13,823 clusters in the maxBCG
catalog, and measure the red sequence ridgeline location and scatter of each.
These measurements provide precise constraints on the variation of the average
red galaxy populations in the observed frame with redshift. We find that the
scatter of the red sequence ridgeline increases mildly with redshift, and that
the slope decreases with redshift. We also observe that the slope does not
strongly depend on cluster richness. Using similar methods, we show that this
behavior is mirrored in a spectroscopic sample of field galaxies, further
emphasizing that ridgeline properties are independent of environment.

usually captured by the notion of the \emph{core}--the set of outcomes such
that no subgroup of players has an incentive to deviate. However, some
coalitional games have empty cores, and any outcome in such a game is unstable.
  In this paper, we investigate the possibility of stabilizing a coalitional
game by using external payments. We consider a scenario where an external
party, which is interested in having the players work together, offers a
supplemental payment to the grand coalition (or, more generally, a particular
coalition structure). This payment is conditional on players not deviating from
their coalition(s). The sum of this payment plus the actual gains of the
coalition(s) may then be divided among the agents so as to promote stability.
We define the \emph{cost of stability (CoS)} as the minimal external payment
that stabilizes the game.
  We provide general bounds on the cost of stability in several classes of
games, and explore its algorithmic properties. To develop a better intuition
for the concepts we introduce, we provide a detailed algorithmic study of the
cost of stability in weighted voting games, a simple but expressive class of
games which can model decision-making in political bodies, and cooperation in
multiagent settings. Finally, we extend our model and results to games with
coalition structures.

analysis of the molecular hydrogen absorption lines in archival VLT/UVES
spectra of the damped Lyman alpha systems in the QSOs Q0347-383 and Q0405-443
yields a combined measurement of a (Delta mu)/mu value of (-7 +/- 8) x 10^{-6},
consistent with no change in the value of mu over a time span of 11.5
gigayears. Here we define (Delta mu) as (mu_z - mu_0) where mu_z is the value
of mu at a redshift of z and mu_0 is the present day value. Our null result is
consistent with the recent measurements of King et al. 2009, (Delta mu)/u =
(2.6 +/- 3.0) x 10^{-6}, and inconsistent with the positive detection of a
change in mu by Reinhold et al. 2006. Both of the previous studies and this
study are based on the same data but with differing analysis methods.
Improvements in the wavelength calibration over the UVES pipeline calibration
is a key element in both of the null results. This leads to the conclusion that
the fundamental constant mu is unchanged to an accuracy of 10^{-5} over the
last 80% of the age of the universe, well into the matter dominated epoch. This
limit provides constraints on models of dark energy that invoke rolling scalar
fields and also limits the parameter space of Super Symmetric or string theory
models of physics. New instruments, both planned and under construction, will

years ago; however, this elusive particle has never been observed in nature.
The non-local character of the Majorana fermion can be useful for topological
quantum computation. Recently, it has been shown that the 3He-B phase is a
time-reversal invariant topological superfluid, with a single component of
gapless Majorana fermion state localized on the surface. Such a Majorana
surface state contains half the degrees of freedom of the single Dirac surface
state recently observed in topological insulators. We show here that the
Majorana surface state can be detected through an electron spin relaxation
experiment. The Majorana nature of the surface state can be revealed though the
striking angular dependence of the relaxation time on the magnetic field
direction, $1/T_1 \propto sin^2 \theta$ where $\theta$ is the angle between the
magnetic field and the surface normal. The temperature dependence of the spin
relaxation rate can reveal the gapless linear dispersion of the Majorana
surface state. We propose a spin relaxation experiment setup where we inject an
electron inside a nano-sized bubble below the helium liquid surface.

different environments ranging from small groups to rich clusters in order to
understand galaxy evolution in these environments. Our simulations
self-consistently incorporate effects of ram pressure of intergalactic medium
(IGM) on disk and halo gas of galaxies and hydrodynamical interaction between
disk and halo gas so that mass fractions of halos gas stripped by ram pressure
of IGM (F_strip) can be better estimated. We mainly investigate how F_strip
depends on total masses of their host environments (M_host}), galactic masses
(M_gal), densities and temperature of IGM (T_IGM and rho_IGM, respectively),
relative velocities between IGM and galaxies (V_r), and physical properties of
disks (e.g., gas mass fraction). We find that typically 60-80% of halo gas can
be efficiently stripped from Milky Way-type disk galaxies by ram pressure in
clusters with M_host 10^{14} M_sun We also find that F_strip depends on M_host
such that F_strip is higher for larger M_host. Furthermore it is found that
F_strip can be higher in disk galaxies with smaller M_gal for a given
environment. Our simulations demonstrate that the presence of disk gas can
suppress ram pressure stripping of halo gas owing to hydrodynamical interaction
between halo and disk gas. Ram pressure stripping of halo gas is found to be
efficient (i.e., F_strip>0.5) even in small and/or compact groups, if rho_IGM ~
10^5 M_sun/kpc^3 and V_r ~ 400 km/s. Based on the derived radial distributions
of remaining halo gas after ram pressure stripping, we propose that truncation
of star formation after halo gas stripping can occur outside-in in disk
galaxies.

can not be reproduced by many chemical models. CO+ is more likely to be
destroyed than excited in collisions with hydrogen. An anomalous excitation
mechanism may thus have to be considered when interpreting CO^+ observations.
Chemical models are used to perform a parameter study of CO^+ abundances. Line
fluxes are calculated for N(CO+)=10^12 cm^-2 and different gas densities and
temperatures using a non-LTE escape probability method. The chemical formation
and destruction rates are considered explicitly in the detailed balance
equations of the radiative transfer. In addition, the rotational levels of CO+
are assumed to be excited upon chemical formation according to a formation
temperature. It is found, that chemical models are generally able to produce
high fractional CO+ abundances (x(CO+) =10^-10). In a far-ultraviolet (FUV)
dominated environment, however, high abundances of CO+ are only produced in
regions with a Habing field G0 > 100 and T(kin) > 600 K, posing a strong
constraint on the gas temperature. For gas densities >10^6 cm^-3 and
temperatures > 600 K, the combination of chemical and radiative transfer
analysis shows little effect on intensities of CO+ lines with upper levels N_up
<= 3. Significantly different line fluxes are calculated with an anomalous
excitation mechanism, however, for transitions with higher upper levels and
densities >10^6 cm ^ -3. The Herschel Space Observatory is able to reveal such
effects in the terahertz wavelength regime. Ideal objects to observe are
protoplanetary disks with densities 10^6 cm^-3. It is finally suggested that
the CO+ chemistry may be well understood and that the abundances observed so
far can be explained with a high enough gas temperature and a proper geometry.

homogeneous external field expressed through the finite-difference equation is
constructed. Explicit expressions of the relativistic oscillator Wigner
quasi-distribution function for the stationary states as well as of states of
thermodynamical equilibrium are obtained and their correct limits are shown.

breaking of the flow in the interior of planets and stars. Using a model of
spherical dynamo, we observe that the interaction between a dipolar and a
quadrupolar mode can localize the magnetic field in only one hemisphere when
the equatorial symmetry is broken. This process is shown to be related to the
one that is responsible for reversals of the magnetic field. These seemingly
very different behaviors are thus understood in a unified framework.
