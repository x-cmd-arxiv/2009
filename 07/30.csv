an interacting dark energy model to find the adiabatic initial conditions for
the Boltzmann integration. In a model where the interaction is proportional to
the dark matter density, adiabatic initial conditions and viable cosmologies
are possible if the early-time dark energy equation of state parameter is $w_e
> -4/5$. We find that when adiabaticity between cold dark matter, baryons,
neutrinos and photons is demanded, the dark energy component satisfies
automatically the adiabaticity condition. As supernovae Ia or baryon acoustic
oscillation data require the recent-time equation of state parameter to be more
negative, we consider a time-varying equation of state in our model. In a
companion paper [arXiv:0907.4987] we apply the initial conditions derived here,
and perform a full Monte Carlo Markov Chain likelihood analysis of this model.

luminosities and the baryon acoustic oscillation signal in the galaxy
distribution to constrain the cosmological parameters in a simple interacting
dark energy model with a time-varying equation of state. Using a Monte Carlo
Markov Chain technique we determine the posterior likelihoods. Constraints from
the individual data sets are weak, but the combination of the three data sets
confines the interaction constant $\Gamma$ to be less than 23% of the expansion
rate of the Universe $H_0$; at 95% CL $-0.23 < \Gamma/H_0 < +0.15$. The CMB
acoustic peaks can be well fitted even if the interaction rate is much larger,
but this requires a larger or smaller (depending on the sign of interaction)
matter density today than in the non-interacting model. Due to this degeneracy
between the matter density and the interaction rate, the only observable effect
on the CMB is a larger or smaller integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect. While SN
or BAO data alone do not set any direct constraints on the interaction, they
exclude the models with very large matter density, and hence indirectly
constrain the interaction rate when jointly analysed with the CMB data. To
enable the analysis described in this paper, we present in a companion paper

field, we provide CCD BVRI photometry. For a smaller region close to the
cluster's center, we also provide near-infrared JHK photometry. Aims. We
analyze the properties of NGC 6253 by using our new photometric data and
astrometric membership. Methods. In June 2004, we targeted the cluster during a
10 day multi-site campaign, which involved the MPG/ESO 2.2m telescope with its
wide-field imager and the Anglo-Australian 3.9m telescope, equipped with the
IRIS2 near-infrared imager. Archival CCD images of NGC 6253 were used to derive
relative proper motions and to calculate the cluster membership probabilities.
Results. We have refined the cluster's fundamental parameters, deriving
(V_0-M_v)=11.15, E(B - V)=0.15, E(V - I)=0.25, E(V - J)=0.50, and E(V -
H)=0.55. The color excess ratios obtained using both the optical and near
infrared colors indicate a normal reddening law in the direction of NGC 6253.
The age of NGC 6253 at 3.5 Gyr, determined from our best-fitting isochrone
appears to be slightly older than the previous estimates. Finally, we estimated
the binary fraction among the cluster members to be \sim20%-30% and identified
11 blue straggler candidates.

between the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (kSZ) -- produced by the
scattering of CMB photons off free electrons produced during the reionization
process -- and the cosmological 21cm signal -- which reflects the neutral
hydrogen content of the Universe, as a function of redshift. The study is
carried out using a simulated reionization history in 100Mpc/h scale N-body

anti-correlate. The significance of the anti-correlation signal depends on the
extent of the reionization process, wherein extended histories result in a much
stronger signal compared to instantaneous cases. Unfortunately however, once
the primary CMB fluctuations are included into our simulation they serve as a
source of large correlated noise that renders the cross-correlation signal
insignificant, regardless of the reionization scenario.

molecular ridge is unique insofar as it allows us to study the properties of
molecular gas as a function of the ambient radiation field in a low-metallicity

the molecular ridge do not vary with the strength of the far-ultraviolet (FUV)
radiation field. Since the peak CO brightness of the clumps shows no
correlation with the radiation field strength, the observed constant value for
CO-to-H_2 conversion factor along the ridge seems to require an increase in the
kinetic temperature of the molecular gas that is offset by a decrease in the
angular filling factor of the CO emission. We find that the difference between
the CO-to-H_2 conversion factor in the molecular ridge and the outer Milky Way
is smaller than has been reported by previous studies of the CO emission:
applying the same cloud identification and analysis methods to our CO
observations of the LMC molecular ridge and CO data from the outer Galaxy

factor in the molecular ridge is X_CO = (3.9+/-2.5)10^20 cm^-2 (K km s^-1)^-1,
approximately twice the value that we determine for the outer Galaxy clouds.

clumps in the molecular ridge are similar, but not identical, to those that
have been established for Galactic molecular clouds.

parameters for newly discovered planets, especially those with small radii (R_p
less than approximately 4 Earth radii) and/or intermediate to long orbital

curves from Kepler-like photometry and ground-based observations in the
near-infrared (NIR) to determine how jointly modeling space-based and
ground-based light curves can improve measurements of the transit duration and
planet-star radius ratio. We find that adding observations of at least one

accuracy for measuring the transit duration and planet-star radius ratio of
small planets (R_p less than approximately 4 Earth radii) in long-period (~1
year) orbits, largely thanks to the reduced effect of limb darkening in the
NIR. We also demonstrate that multiple ground-based observations are needed to
gain a substantial improvement in the measurement accuracy for small planets
with short orbital periods (~3 days). Finally, we consider the role that higher
ground-based precisions will play in constraining parameter measurements for
typical Kepler targets. Our results can help inform the priorities of transit
follow-up programs (including both primary and secondary transit of planets
discovered with Kepler and CoRoT), leading to improved constraints for transit

(Auger) for Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR), in particular, the mass
composition being steadily heavier with increasing energy from 3 EeV to 35 EeV.
The model is based on the proton-dominated composition in the energy range (1 -
3) EeV observed in both Auger and HiRes experiments. Assuming extragalactic
origin of this component, we argue that it must disappear at higher energies
due to a low maximum energy of acceleration, E_p^{\max} \sim (4 - 10) EeV.
Under an assumption of rigidity acceleration mechanism, the maximum
acceleration energy for a nucleus with the charge number Z is ZE_p^{\max}, and
the highest energy in the spectrum, reached by Iron, does not exceed (100 -
200) EeV. The growth of atomic weight with energy, observed in Auger, is
provided by the rigidity mechanism of acceleration, since at each energy
E=ZE_p^{\max} the contribution of nuclei with Z' < Z vanishes. The described
model has disappointing consequences for future observations in UHECR: Since
average energies per nucleon for all nuclei are less than (2 - 4) EeV, (i) pion
photo-production on CMB photons in extragalactic space is absent; (ii) GZK
cutoff in the spectrum does not exist; (iii) cosmogenic neutrinos produced on
CMBR are absent; (iv) fluxes of cosmogenic neutrinos produced on infrared -
optical background radiation are too low for registration by existing detectors
and projects. Due to nuclei deflection in galactic magnetic fields, the
correlation with nearby sources is absent even at highest energies.

an emphasis on developing a self-consistent treatment of the gravitational
self-force. An analysis of the various derivations extant in the literature
leads me to formulate an asymptotic expansion in which the metric is expanded
while a representative worldline is held fixed; I discuss the utility of this
expansion for both exact point particles and asymptotically small bodies,
contrasting it with a regular expansion in which both the metric and the
worldline are expanded. Based on these preliminary analyses, I present a
general method of deriving self-consistent equations of motion for arbitrarily
structured (sufficiently compact) small bodies. My method utilizes two
expansions: an inner expansion that keeps the size of the body fixed, and an
outer expansion that lets the body shrink while holding its worldline fixed. By
imposing the Lorenz gauge, I express the global solution to the Einstein
equation in the outer expansion in terms of an integral over a worldtube of
small radius surrounding the body. Appropriate boundary data on the tube are
determined from a local-in-space expansion in a buffer region where both the
inner and outer expansions are valid. This buffer-region expansion also results
in an expression for the self-force in terms of irreducible pieces of the
metric perturbation on the worldline. Based on the global solution, these
pieces of the perturbation can be written in terms of a tail integral over the
body's past history. This approach can be applied at any order to obtain a
self-consistent approximation that is valid on long timescales, both near and
far from the small body. I conclude by discussing possible extensions of my
method and comparing it to alternative approaches.

type-1 AGN in the COSMOS survey at 1<z<2. For 10 AGN at mean redshift z~1.4
with both HST/ACS and HST/NICMOS imaging data we are able to compute total
stellar mass M_(*,total), based on restframe UV-to-optical host galaxy colors
which constrain mass-to-light ratios. All objects have virial BH mass-estimates
available from the COSMOS Magellan/IMACS and zCOSMOS surveys. We find zero
difference between the M_BH--M_(*,total)-relation at z~1.4 and the
M_BH--M_(*,bulge)-relation in the local Universe.
  Our interpretation is: (a) If our objects were purely bulge-dominated, the
M_BH--M_(*,bulge)-relation has not evolved since z~1.4. However, (b) since we
have evidence for substantial disk components, the bulges of massive galaxies
(logM_(*,total)=11.1+-0.25 or logM_BH~8.3+-0.2) must have grown over the last 9
Gyrs predominantly by redistribution of disk- into bulge-mass. Since all
necessary stellar mass exists in the galaxy at z=1.4, no star-formation or
addition of external stellar material is required, only a redistribution e.g.
induced by minor and major merging or through disk instabilities. Merging, in
addition to redistributing mass in the galaxy, will add both BH and
stellar/bulge mass, but does not change the overall final M_BH/M_(*,bulge)
ratio.
  Since the overall cosmic stellar and BH mass buildup trace each other tightly
over time, our scenario of bulge-formation in massive galaxies is independent
of any strong BH-feedback and means that the mechanism coupling BH and bulge
mass until the present is very indirect.

variations in light elements observed in Galactic globular clusters. We analyse
the main impacts of a first generation of rotating intermediate-mass stars on
the chemical properties of second-generation globular cluster stars. The
rotating models were computed without magnetic fields and without the effects
of internal gravity waves. They account for the transports by meridional
currents and turbulence. We computed the evolution of both standard and
rotating stellar models with initial masses between 2.5 and 8 Msun within the
metallicity range covered by Galactic globular clusters. During central
He-burning, rotational mixing transports fresh CO-rich material from the core
towards the hydrogen-burning shell, leading to the production of primary 14N.
In stars more massive than M > 4 Msun, the convective envelope reaches this
reservoir during the second dredge-up episode, resulting in a large increase in
the total C+N+O content at the stellar surface and in the stellar wind. The
corresponding pollution depends on the initial metallicity. At low- and
intermediate-metallicity, it is at odds with the constancy of C+N+O observed
among globular cluster low-mass stars. With the given input physics, our models
suggest that massive rotating AGB stars have not shaped the abundance patterns
observed in low- and intermediate-metallicity globular clusters. Our
non-rotating models, on the other hands, do not predict surface C+N+O
enhancements, hence are in a better position as sources of the chemical
anomalies in globular clusters showing the constancy of the C+N+O. However at
the moment, there is no reason to think that intermediate mass stars were not
rotating.

episodes, called ""precursors"", whose nature is still a puzzle: they could
either have the same origin as the main emission episode or they could be due
to another mechanism. We investigate if precursors have some spectral
distinctive feature with respect to the main GRB episodes. Methods: To this aim
we compare the spectral evolution of the precursor with that of the main GRB
event. We also study if and how the spectral parameters, and in particular the
peak of the vFv spectrum of time resolved spectra, correlates with the flux.
This allows us to test if the spectra of the precursor and of the main event
belong to the same correlation (if any). We searched GRBs with precursor
activity in the complete sample of 2704 bursts detected by BATSE finding that
12% of GRBs have one or more precursors. Among these we considered the bursts
with time resolved spectral analysis performed by Kaneko et al. 2006, selecting
those having at least two time resolved spectra for the precursor. Results: We
find that precursors and main events have very similar spectral properties. The
spectral evolution within precursors has similar trends as the spectral
evolution observed in the subsequent peaks. Also the typical spectral
parameters of the precursors are similar to those of the main GRB events.
Moreover, in several cases we find that within the precursors the peak energy
of the spectrum is correlated with the flux similarly to what happens in the
main GRB event. This strongly favors models in which the precursor is due to
the same fireball physics of the main emission episodes.

orbit of this planet is not only highly eccentric (e=0.93), but is also tilted

the Kozai mechanism. Independently of the theory, it is noteworthy that all 3

where we model the emission of different forms of energy and matter from the

ionizing photons, and the kinetic energy of the stellar winds and supernova
explosions. We investigate various alternative astrophysical inputs and the
resulting output sensitivities, especially effects due to the inclusion of
rotation in stellar models. As the aim of the code is the application to
relatively small populations of massive stars, special care is taken to address
their statistical properties. Our code incorporates both analytical statistical
methods applicable to small populations, as well as extensive Monte Carlo
simulations. We find that the inclusion of rotation in the stellar models has a
large impact on the interactions between OB associations and their surrounding
interstellar medium. The emission of 26Al in the stellar winds is strongly
enhanced, compared to non-rotating models with the same mass-loss prescription.
This compensates the recent reductions in the estimates of mass-loss rates of
massive stars due to the effects of clumping. Despite the lower mass-loss
rates, the power of the winds is actually enhanced for rotating stellar models.
The supernova power (kinetic energy of their ejecta) is decreased due to longer
lifetimes of rotating stars, and therefore the wind power dominates over
supernova power for the first 6 Myr after a burst of star-formation. For
populations typical of nearby star-forming regions, the statistical
uncertainties are large and clearly non-Gaussian.

redshift-space to include gravitational redshift. The extra contribution to the
standard galaxy power spectrum is suppressed by k_c^{-2}, where k_c=c k/a H (k
is the wavevector, a the expansion factor, and H=\dot{a}/a), and is thus
effectively limited to the few largest-scale modes and very difficult to
detect; however, a correlation, \propto k_c^{-1}, is generated between the real
and imaginary parts of the Fourier space density fields of two different types
of galaxy, which would otherwise be zero, i.e., the cross-power spectrum has an
imaginary part: P_{ab}(k,\mu)/P(k)=(b_a+f\mu^2)(b_b+f\mu^2)
-i(3\Omega_m/2)(\mu/k_c)(b_a-b_b)+\mathcal{O}(k_c^{-2}), where P(k) is the
real-space mass-density power spectrum, b_i are the galaxy biases, \mu is the
cosine of the angle between the wavevector and line of sight, and f=dlnD/dlna
(D is the linear growth factor). The total signal-to-noise of measurements of
this effect is not dominated by the largest scales -- it converges at k~0.05
h/Mpc. This gravitational redshift result is pedagogically interesting, but
naive in that it is gauge dependent and there are other effects of similar form
and size, related to the transformation between observable and proper
coordinates. I include these effects, which add other contributions to the
coefficient of \mu/k_c, and add a \mu^3/k_c term, but don't qualitatively
change the picture. The leading source of noise in the measurement is galaxy
shot-noise, not sample variance, so developments that allow higher S/N surveys
can make this measurement powerful, although it would otherwise be only
marginally detectable in a JDEM-scale survey.

results on the distribution of line-of-sight velocity offsets between MgII

a high-velocity population of MgII NALs extending out to at least 6000 km/s
from the QSOs, which cannot be ascribed to the clustering of local galaxies,
similar to that observed recently for CIV absorbers. The very existence of such
low ionisation gas clouds in the intense ionising field of the QSO suggests
that we may indeed be witnessing the mechanical expulsion of gas, alongside the
heating previously observed. I also show that there is a significant excess of
low-velocity MgII NALs in radio-loud QSOs compared to radio-quiet QSOs. In the
near future, improved QSO clustering results will allow us to say whether this

body K in R^n. We investigate two approaches to measuring the complexity of F.
First, we find an upper bound on the transversal number $\tau(F)$ of F in terms
of $n$ and the independence number $\nu(F)$. This question is motivated by a
problem of Gr\""unbaum. Our bound $\tau(F)\le 2^n \binom{2n}{n} (n \log n +
\log\log n + 5n) \nu(F)$ is exponential in n, an improvement from the
previously known bound of Kim, Nakprasit, Pelsmajer and Skokan, which was of
order n^n. By a lower bound, we show that the right order of magnitude is
exponential in n.
  Next, we consider another measure of complexity, the Vapnik--Chervonenkis
dimension of F. We prove that this quantity is at most 3 if n=2 and is infinite
for some F if n>2. This settles a conjecture of G\""unbaum: Show that the
maximum dual VC-dimension of a family of positive homothets of a given convex
body K in R^n is n+1. This conjecture was disproved by Naiman and Wynn, who
constructed a counterexample of dual VC-dimension $\lfloor 3n/2\rfloor$. Our

They
connect the mathematical structures used in theoretical models with physical
phenomena, but they also constitute our fundamental assumptions about reality.
Many of the discrepancies between quantum physics and classical physics
(including Maxwell's electrodynamics and relativity) can be traced back to
these categorical foundations. We argue that classical physics corresponds to
the factual aspects of reality and requires a categorical framework which
consists of four interdependent components: boolean logic, the
linear-sequential notion of time, the principle of sufficient reason, and the
dichotomy between observer and observed. None of these can be dropped without
affecting the others. However, in quantum theory the reduction postulate also

Therefore, quantum phyics requires a different conceptual framework which will
be elaborated in this article. It is shown that many of its components are
already present in the standard formalisms of quantum physics, but in most
cases they are highlighted not so much from a conceptual perspective but more
from their mathematical structures. The categorical frame underlying quantum
physics includes a profoundly different notion of time which encompasses a
crucial role for the present.

graphene nanoribbons focusing on the effect of edge shapes and impurity
scattering. The low-energy electronic states of graphene have two
non-equivalent massless Dirac spectrum. The relative distance between these two
Dirac points in the momentum space and edge states due to the existence of the
zigzag type graphene edges are decisive to the electronic and transport
properties of graphene nanoribbons. In graphene nanoribbons with zigzag edges,
two valleys related to each Dirac spectrum are well separated in momentum
space. The propagating modes in each valley contain a single chiral mode
originating from a partially flat band at band center. This feature gives rise
to a perfectly conducting channel in the disordered system, if the impurity
scattering does not connect the two valleys, i.e. for long-range impurity
potentials. On the other hand, the low-energy spectrum of graphene nanoribbons
with armchair edges is described as the superposition of two non-equivalent
Dirac points of graphene. In spite of the lack of well-separated two valley
structures, the single-channel transport subjected to long-ranged impurities is
nearly perfectly conducting, where the backward scattering matrix elements in
the lowest order vanish as a manifestation of internal phase structures of the
wavefunction. Symmetry considerations lead to the classification of disordered
zigzag ribbons into the unitary class for long-range impurities, and the
orthogonal class for short-range impurities. However, no such crossover occurs
in armchair nanoribbons.

invariably finds a 10^6-10^9 M_Sun supermassive black hole at their centre. In
contrast, within dwarf elliptical galaxies one predominantly observes a
10^5-10^7 M_Sun nuclear star cluster. To date, few galaxies have been found
with both type of nuclei coexisting and even less have had the masses
determined for both central components. Here we identify one dozen galaxies
housing nuclear star clusters and supermassive black holes whose masses have
been measured. This doubles the known number of such hermaphrodite nuclei -
which are expected to be fruitful sources of gravitational radiation. Over the
host spheroid (stellar) mass range from 10^8 to 10^11 M_Sun, we find that a
galaxy's nucleus-to-spheroid (baryon) mass ratio is not a constant value but
decreases from a few percent to ~0.3 percent such that log[(M_BH+M_NC)/M_sph] =
-(0.39+/-0.07)log[M_sph/10^10 M_Sun] -(2.18+/-0.07). Once dry merging has
commenced by M_sph ~ 10^11 M_Sun and the nuclear star clusters have
disappeared, this ratio is expected to become a constant value.
  As a byproduct of our investigation, we have found that the projected flux
from resolved nuclear star clusters can be well approximated with Sersic
functions having a range of indices from ~0.5 to ~3, the latter index
describing the Milky Way's nuclear star cluster.

impurity potential using the linear response theory, employing an approximation
that simply replaces the self-energy by a constant value $-i \hbar /(2 \tau)$
with $\tau$ the scattering time. The approximation is equivalent to assuming
that the broadening of a Landau level due to disorder is represented by a
Lorentzian with the width $\Gamma = \hbar /(2 \tau)$. Analytic formulas are
obtained for both $\sigma_{xx}$ and $\sigma_{xy}$ within the framework of this
simple approximation at low temperatures. By examining the leading terms in
$\sigma_{xx}$ and $\sigma_{xy}$, we find a proportional relation between
$\mathrm{d}\sigma_{xy}/\mathrm{d}B$ and $B \sigma_{xx}^2$. The relation, after
slight modification to account for the long-range nature of the impurity
potential, is shown to be in quantitative agreement with experimental results
obtained in the GaAs/AlGaAs two-dimensional electron system at the low
magnetic-field regime where spin splitting is negligibly small.

numerical integration over systematic `nuisance' parameters, and is not
restricted to simple, idealized cases as is analytic marginalization. It does
not assume the data are normally distributed, and does not require Gaussian
priors on the specific systematic uncertainties. We show that MCBR properly
accounts for and provides the marginalized errors of the parameters. The method
can be generalized and used to propagate any systematic uncertainties for which
a set of templates is available. We apply the method to the Planck satellite,
and consider future experiments. Beam measurement errors should have a small
effect on cosmological parameters as long as the beam fitting is performed
after removal of 1/f noise.

10 times better than existing published values. Clusters of 2 or 3 sites are
occasionally found to account for single previously listed sources. This in
turn reveals that the velocity range for each individual site is sometimes
smaller than that of the originally tabulated (blended) source. Only a handful
of examples then remain with a velocity range of more than 16 km/s at a single
compact (less than 2 arcsec) site. The precise methanol positions now allow
apparent coincidences with OH masers to be confidently accepted or rejected;
this has led to the important conclusion that, where a 1665-MHz OH maser lies
in a massive star formation region, at more than 80 percent of the OH sites
there is a precisely coincident methanol maser. The methanol precision achieved
here will also allow clear comparisons with likely associated IR sources when

elaborate the sense in which wave-function realism does provide an ontological
picture; and defend it from certain objections that have been raised against
it. However, there are good reasons to be dissatisfied with wave-function
realism, as we go on to elaborate. This motivates the development of an
opposing picture: what we call spacetime state realism; a view which takes the
states associated to spacetime regions as fundamental. This approach enjoys a
number of beneficial features, although, unlike wave-function realism, it
involves non-separability at the level of fundamental ontology. We investigate
the pros and cons of this non-separability, arguing that it is a quite
acceptable feature; even one which proves fruitful in the context of
relativistic covariance. A companion paper discusses the prospects for
combining a spacetime-based ontology with separability, along lines suggested

Finally, the variation of the axis ratio of the halo with galactic longitude is
almost flat, <(c/a)>=0.56, except a slight minimum and a small maximum in the
second and third quadrants, respectively, indicating an effect of the long bar

dissipational collapse. However, its change is steeper in the transition
regions of different galactic components. The metallicity gradient is almost
zero for inner halo (5<z<10 kpc), indicating a formation of merger or accretion
of numerous fragments such as dwarf galaxies.

Under certain assumptions, this process converges to the solution to
Smoluchowski equation, as the number of particles increases to infinity. The
Marcus-Lushnikov process gives at each time the distribution of masses of the

GLFs in various regions, and by looking at the galaxy distribution at large
scale around Abell 780. Our study is based on optical images obtained with the

of 67.22x32.94 arcmin^2, or 4.235x2.075 Mpc^2 for a cluster redshift of 0.0539.
In a region of 500 kpc radius around the cluster centre, the GLF in the R band
shows a double structure, with a broad and flat bright part and a flat faint
end that can be fit by a power law with an index alpha=-0.85+-0.12 in the
20.25<R<21.75 interval. If we divide this 500 kpc radius region in North+South
or East+West halves, we find no clear difference between the GLFs in these
smaller regions. No obvious large scale structure is apparent within 5 Mpc from
the cluster, based on galaxy redshifts and magnitudes collected from the NED
database in a much larger region than that covered by our data, suggesting that
there is no major infall of material in any preferential direction. However,
the Serna-Gerbal method reveals the presence of a gravitationally bound
structure of 27 galaxies, which includes the cD, and of a more strongly
gravitationally bound structure of 14 galaxies. These optical results agree

improve the fit significantly. The photon index changes from $\Gamma$ = 1.0

proposed, with applications including dimensionality reduction, homogeneity
testing, and independence testing. This embedding represents any probability
measure as a mean element in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). A
pseudometric on the space of probability measures can be defined as the
distance between distribution embeddings: we denote this as $\gamma_k$, indexed
by the kernel function $k$ that defines the inner product in the RKHS.
  We present three theoretical properties of $\gamma_k$. First, we consider the
question of determining the conditions on the kernel $k$ for which $\gamma_k$
is a metric: such $k$ are denoted {\em characteristic kernels}. Unlike
pseudometrics, a metric is zero only when two distributions coincide, thus
ensuring the RKHS embedding maps all distributions uniquely (i.e., the
embedding is injective). While previously published conditions may apply only
in restricted circumstances (e.g. on compact domains), and are difficult to
check, our conditions are straightforward and intuitive: bounded continuous
strictly positive definite kernels are characteristic. Alternatively, if a
bounded continuous kernel is translation-invariant on $\bb{R}^d$, then it is
characteristic if and only if the support of its Fourier transform is the
entire $\bb{R}^d$. Second, we show that there exist distinct distributions that
are arbitrarily close in $\gamma_k$. Third, to understand the nature of the
topology induced by $\gamma_k$, we relate $\gamma_k$ to other popular metrics
on probability measures, and present conditions on the kernel $k$ under which
$\gamma_k$ metrizes the weak topology.

nucleation times and to address its role in the context of eukaryotic
chemotaxis (i.e. the process which allows cells to identify and follow a
gradient of chemical attractant). As a first step in this direction we study
the nucleation dynamics of the 2d Ising model defined on a cylindrical lattice
whose radius changes as a function of time. Geometry variation is obtained by
changing the relative value of the couplings between spins in the compactified
(vertical) direction with respect to the horizontal one. This allows us to keep
the lattice size unchanged and study in a single simulation the values of the
compactification radius which change in time. We show, both with theoretical
arguments and numerical simulations that squeezing the geometry allows the
system to speed up nucleation times even in presence of a very small energy gap
between the stable and the metastable states. We then address the implications
of our analysis for directional chemotaxis. The initial steps of chemotaxis can
be modelled as a nucleation process occurring on the cell membrane as a
consequence of the external chemical gradient (which plays the role of energy
gap between the stable and metastable phases). In nature most of the cells
modify their geometry by extending quasi-onedimensional protrusions (filopodia)
so as to enhance their sensitivity to chemoattractant. Our results show that
this geometry variation has indeed the effect of greatly decreasing the
timescale of the nucleation process even in presence of very small amounts of
chemoattractants.

processes on networks, to identify their commonalities and differences. In
particular, models of social and financial cascades, as well as the fiber
bundle model, the voter model, and models of epidemic spreading are recovered
as special cases. To unify their description, we define the net fragility of a
node, which is the difference between its fragility and the threshold that
determines its failure. Nodes fail if their net fragility grows above zero and
their failure increases the fragility of neighbouring nodes, thus possibly
triggering a cascade. In this framework, we identify three classes depending on
the way the fragility of a node is increased by the failure of a neighbour. At
the microscopic level, we illustrate with specific examples how the failure
spreading pattern varies with the node triggering the cascade, depending on its
position in the network and its degree. At the macroscopic level, systemic risk
is measured as the final fraction of failed nodes, $X^\ast$, and for each of
the three classes we derive a recursive equation to compute its value. The
phase diagram of $X^\ast$ as a function of the initial conditions, thus allows
for a prediction of the systemic risk as well as a comparison of the three
different model classes. We could identify which model class lead to a
first-order phase transition in systemic risk, i.e. situations where small
changes in the initial conditions may lead to a global failure. Eventually, we
generalize our framework to encompass stochastic contagion models. This
indicates the potential for further generalizations.

of the ground state gamma-transition in the astrophysically important
12C(alpha,gamma)16O reaction in several experiments including those performed
at TRIUMF and several other laboratories. A review of the published
measurements is given, and GEANT4 simulations and R-Matrix calculations are
presented to further clarify the observed alpha spectra. A clear
response-function, in the form of a low-energy tail from the scattering of
alpha-particles in the catcher foil is observed in these simulations for any
foil thickness. Contrary to claims in the literature, the simulations show that
the TRIUMF measurement and those performed at Yale and Mainz originate from the
same underlying spectrum. The simulations suggests that the discrepancies
between the Yale and TRIUMF final results can be attributed to incorrect
deconvolution methods applied in the former case. The simulations show in
general that the form (width) of the spectrum is very sensitive to the catcher
foil thickness. It is concluded that the TRIUMF measurement most likely
represents the currently closest approximation to the true beta-delayed
alpha-decay spectrum of 16N.

to understand the space-time evolution as the struck quark becomes a full-blown
hadron as it propagates through nuclear matter.

complexity and weak complexity indices -- which are well-suited for the study
of ""completely integrable"" Hamiltonian systems. These invariants can be seen as
""slow entropies"", they describe the polynomial growth rate of the number of
balls (for the usual ""dynamical"" distances) of coverings of the ambient space.
We then define a new class of integrable systems, which we call decomposable
systems, for which one can prove that the weak complexity index is smaller than
the number of degrees of freedom. Hamiltonian systems integrable by means of
non-degenerate integrals (in Eliasson-Williamson sense), subjected to natural
additional assumptions, are the main examples of decomposable systems. We
finally give explicit examples of computation of the complexity index, for
Morse Hamiltonian systems on surfaces and for two-dimensional gradient systems.

contained in the region of coexistence of the three species of a tritrophic

some values of the parameters three limit cycles bear via this bifurcation. One
is contained in the plane where the top predator is absent. Another one is not
contained in the domain of interest where all variables are positive. The third
one is contained where the three species coexist.

resolution for X-ray and gamma-ray astronomy. Sub-micro-arc-second angular
resolution, necessary to achieve objectives such as imaging the regions around
the event horizon of a super-massive black hole at the center of an active
galaxy, can be achieved if beams from parts of the incoming wavefront separated
by 100s of meters can be stably and accurately brought together at small
angles. One way of achieving this is by using grazing incidence mirrors. We
here investigate an alternative approach in which the beams are recombined by
optical elements working in transmission. It is shown that the use of
diffractive elements is a particularly attractive option. We report
experimental results from a simple 2-beam interferometer using a low-cost
commercially available profiled film as the diffractive elements. A
rotationally symmetric filled (or mostly filled) aperture variant of such an
interferometer, equivalent to an X-ray axicon, is shown to offer a much wider
bandpass than either a Phase Fresnel Lens (PFL) or a PFL with a refractive lens
in an achromatic pair. Simulations of an example system are presented.

spacetime. This is achieved in two steps. We first demonstrate unitarity for a
class of NW/U(1) modules: the norm of any state which is primary with respect
to a chosen timelike U(1) is non-negative. We then show that physical states -
states satisfying the Virasoro constraints - in a class of modules of an
affinisation of the Nappi-Witten algebra are contained in the NW/U(1) modules.
Similar to the case of strings on $AdS_3$, in order to saturate the spectrum
obtained in light-cone quantization we are led to include modules with energy
not bounded from below, which are related to modules with energy bounded from
below by spectral flow automorphisms.

understanding of the role of quark flavor and measurements and theoretical
interpretations of their results have advanced tremendously: apart from masses
and quantum numbers of flavor particles, there now exist detailed measurements
of the characteristics of their interactions allowing stringent tests of
Standard Model predictions. Among the most interesting phenomena of flavor
physics is the violation of the CP symmetry that has been subtle and difficult
to explore. Till early 1990s observations of CP violation were confined to
neutral $K$ mesons, but since then a large number of CP-violating processes
have been studied in detail in neutral $B$ mesons. In parallel, measurements of
the couplings of the heavy quarks and the dynamics for their decays in large
samples of $K, D$, and $B$ mesons have been greatly improved in accuracy and
the results are being used as probes in the search for deviations from the
Standard Model. In the near future, there will be a transition from the current
to a new generation of experiments, thus a review of the status of quark flavor
physics is timely. This report summarizes the results of the current generation
of experiments that is about to be completed and it confronts these results
with the theoretical understanding of the field.
