aimed at a systematic exploration of the optical transient sky. The transient
survey is performed using a new 8.1 square degree camera installed on the
48-inch Samuel Oschin telescope at Palomar Observatory; colors and light curves
for detected transients are obtained with the automated Palomar 60-inch
telescope. PTF uses eighty percent of the 1.2-m and fifty percent of the 1.5-m
telescope time. With an exposure of 60-s the survey reaches a depth of
approximately 21.3 in g' and 20.6 in R (5 sigma, median seeing). Four major
experiments are planned for the five-year project: 1) a 5-day cadence supernova
search; 2) a rapid transient search with cadences between 90 seconds and 1 day;
3) a search for eclipsing binaries and transiting planets in Orion; and 4) a
3-pi sr deep H-alpha survey. PTF provides automatic, realtime transient
classification and follow up, as well as a database including every source
detected in each frame. This paper summarizes the PTF project, including
several months of on-sky performance tests of the new survey camera, the
observing plans and the data reduction strategy. We conclude by detailing the
first 51 PTF optical transient detections, found in commissioning data.

calculate the ground state stripe width of an Ising ferromagnet, frustrated by
an arbitrary long range interaction. In large $n$ systems, we demonstrate that
for a short range system frustrated by a general competing long range

temperature of the unfrustrated short range system (i.e., that in which the
frustrating long range interaction is removed). We also show that apart from
certain special crossover points, the total number of correlation and
modulation lengths remains conserved. We derive an expression for the change in
modulation length with temperature for a general system near the ground state
with a ferromagnetic interaction and an opposing long range interaction. We
illustrate that the correlation functions associated with the exact dipolar
interactions differ substantially from those in which a scalar product form
between the dipoles is assumed.

  This field is uniquely placed to answer recurrent questions raised by the
current trends in scholarly communication: is there an advantage for scientists
to make their work available through repositories, often in preliminary form?
Is there an advantage to publishing in Open Access journals? Do scientists
still read journals or do they use digital repositories?
  The analysis of citation data demonstrates that free and immediate online
dissemination of preprints creates an immense citation advantage in HEP,
whereas publication in Open Access journals presents no discernible advantage.
In addition, the analysis of clickstreams in the leading digital library of the

the 2D Edwards-Anderson Ising spin glass at finite temperature, with
probabilities proportional to their Boltzmann weights. Such an algorithm
overcomes the slow dynamics of direct simulation and can be used to study
long-range correlation functions and coarse-grained dynamics. The algorithm
uses a correspondence between spin configurations on a regular lattice and
dimer (edge) coverings of a related graph: Wilson's algorithm [D. B. Wilson,
Proc. 8th Symp. Discrete Algorithms 258, (1997)] for sampling dimer coverings
on a planar lattice is adapted to generate samplings for the dimer problem
corresponding to both planar and toroidal spin glass samples. This algorithm is
recursive: it computes probabilities for spins along a ""separator"" that divides
the sample in half. Given the spins on the separator, sample configurations for
the two separated halves are generated by further division and assignment. The
algorithm is simplified by using Pfaffian elimination, rather than Gaussian
elimination, for sampling dimer configurations. For n spins and given floating
point precision, the algorithm has an asymptotic run-time of O(n^{3/2}); it is
found that the required precision scales as inverse temperature and grows only
slowly with system size. Sample applications and benchmarking results are
presented for samples of size up to n=128^2, with fixed and periodic boundary
conditions.

characterization of duality in that if G is any cellularly embedded graph with
medial graph G_m, then the orbit of G under the group action is precisely the
set of all graphs with medial graphs isomorphic (as abstract graphs) to G_m. We
provide characterizations of special sets of twisted duals, such as the partial
duals, of embedded graphs in terms of medial graphs and we show how different
kinds of graph isomorphism give rise to these various notions of duality. The
ribbon group action then leads to a deeper understanding of the properties of,

asymptotically flat or a constant curvature spacetime. The spacetime metric has
the geometry of a usual charged C-metric with cosmological constant, where the
mass and charge are equal. When the cosmological constant is absent it is found
that the scalar field only blows up at the angular pole of the event horizon.
The presence of the cosmological constant can generically render the scalar
field regular where the metric is regular, pushing the singularity beyond the
event horizon. For certain cases of enhanced acceleration with a negative
cosmological constant, the conical singularity disappears all together and the
scalar field is everywhere regular. The black hole is then rather a black
string with its event horizon extending all the way to asymptotic infinity and
providing itself the necessary acceleration.

egress of the primary transit and a section of its central part were observed,
allowing the measurement of the planetary radius, and evidence for a spin-orbit

published radial velocities, ground-based photometry, and Spitzer photometry
around the secondary eclipse, as well as new photometric measurements of HD
80606 acquired at Mount Hopkins, Arizona, just before the beginning of the
primary transit. Although the transit is not detected in those new data, they
provide an upper limit for the transit duration, which narrows down the
possible behaviour of the Rossiter-McLaughlin anomaly in the unobserved part of
the transit. We analyse the whole data with a Bayesian approach using a
Markov-chain Monte Carlo integration on all available information. We find R_p
= 0.98 +- 0.03 R_Jup for the planetary radius, and a total primary transit
duration of 11.9 +- 1.3 hours from first to fourth contact. Our analysis
reinforces the hypothesis of spin-orbit misalignment in this system (alignment
excluded at >95 % level), with a positive projected angle between the planetary
orbital axis and the stellar rotation (median solution lambda ~ 50 degrees). As
HD80606 is a component of a binary system, the peculiar orbit of its planet

natural framework for performing hierarchical data processing. A fusion frame
is a frame-like collection of subspaces in a Hilbert space, thereby
generalizing the concept of a frame for signal representation. In this paper,
we study the existence and construction of fusion frames. We first present a
complete characterization of a special class of fusion frames, called Parseval
fusion frames. The value of Parseval fusion frames is that the inverse fusion
frame operator is equal to the identity and therefore signal reconstruction can
be performed with minimal complexity. We then introduce two general methods --
the spatial complement and the Naimark complement -- for constructing a new
fusion frame from a given fusion frame. We then establish existence conditions
for fusion frames with desired properties. In particular, we address the
following question: Given $M, N, m \in \NN$ and $\{\lambda_j\}_{j=1}^M$, does
there exist a fusion frame in $\RR^M$ with $N$ subspaces of dimension $m$ for
which $\{\lambda_j\}_{j=1}^M$ are the eigenvalues of the associated fusion
frame operator? We address this problem by providing an algorithm which
computes such a fusion frame for almost any collection of parameters $M, N, m
\in \NN$ and $\{\lambda_j\}_{j=1}^M$. Moreover, we show how this procedure can
be applied, if subspaces are to be added to a given fusion frame to force it to
become Parseval.

The resulting effect is that models that make sharp predictions are

Jaynes' resolution of the situation involved introducing a large number of

the effects of shock heating and AGN outbursts. Low-frequency radio data are
effective in detecting older and less energetic electron populations and are

Since any (other) completely regular set itself generates a perfect coloring,

limit of ~10^43.8 erg/s over a co-moving volume of 1.12x10^6 Mpc^3 at

with spatially resolved infrared spectroscopy, to identifying the nature of the
ISM using new infrared data from the Spitzer space observatory and X-ray,
optical, and radio data from the literature. (Results): The N157B SNR has no
infrared counterpart. Infrared emission from the region is dominated by the
compact blister-type HII region associated with 2MASS J05375027-6911071 and
excited by an O8-O9 star. This object is part of an extended infrared emission
region that is associated with a molecular cloud. We find only weak emission
from the shock-indicator [FeII], and both the excitation and the heating of the
extended cloud are dominated by photo-ionization by the early O stars of LH99.
(Conclusions): Any possible impact by the expanding SNR does not now affect the
extended cloud of molecules and dust, despite the apparent overlap of SNR X-ray
emission with infrared and Ha emission from the cloud. This implies that the
supernova progenitor cannot have been more massive than about 25 solar masses.

and of different Hubble types. Remarkably, its numerical value mu_{0 D} = 140
M_{sun}/pc^2 = (18.6 Mev)^3 is approximately the same (up to a factor of two)
in all these systems. First, we present the physical consequences of the
independence of mu_{0 D} on r_0: the energy scales as the volume sim r_0^3
while the mass and the entropy scale as the surface ~ r_0^2 and the surface
times log r_0, respectively. Namely, the entropy scales similarly to the
black-hole entropy but with a much smaller coefficient. Second, we compute the
surface gravity and the density profile for small scales from first principles
and the evolution of primordial density fluctuations since the end of inflation
till today using the linearized Boltzmann-Vlasov equation. The density profile
rho_{lin}(r) obtained in this way decreases as r^{-1-n_s/2} for intermediate
scales where n_s = 0.964 is the primordial spectral index. This scaling is in
remarkable agreement with the empirical behaviour found observationally and in
N-body simulations: r^{-1.6\pm 0.4}. The observed value of mu_{0 D} indicates
that the DM particle mass m is in the keV scale. The theoretically derived
density profiles rho_{lin}(r) turn to be cored for m in the keV scale and they
look as cusped for m in the GeV scale or beyond. We consider both fermions and
bosons as DM particles decoupling either ultrarelativistically or
non-relativistically. Our results do not use any particle physics model and
vary slightly with the statistics of the DM particle.

normal state with an electrical resistance which varies linearly with
temperature. This strange metal phase is often identified with the quantum
critical region of a zero temperature quantum critical point (QCP) at hole
density x=x_m, near optimal doping. A long-standing problem with this picture
is that low temperature experiments within the superconducting phase have not
shown convincing signatures of such a optimal doping QCP (except in some
cuprates with small superconducting critical temperatures). I review
theoretical work which proposes a simple resolution of this enigma.
  The crossovers in the normal state are argued to be controlled by a QCP at
x_m linked to the onset of spin density wave (SDW) order in a ""large"" Fermi
surface metal, leading to small Fermi pockets for x<x_m. A key effect is that
the onset of superconductivity at low temperatures disrupts the simplest
canonical quantum critical crossover phase diagram. In particular, the
competition between superconductivity and SDW order_shifts_ the actual QCP to a
lower doping x_s < x_m in the underdoped regime, so that SDW order is only
present for x<x_s. I review the phase transitions and crossovers associated
with the QCPs at x_m and x_s: the resulting phase diagram as a function of x,
temperature, and applied magnetic field consistently explains a number of
recent experiments.

zCOSMOS 10k sample in the redshift range 0.1<z<1.0 over an area of ~1.5 deg2.
The considered sample of secure spectroscopic redshifts contains about 8500
galaxies, with their stellar masses estimated by SED fitting of the
multiwavelength optical to NIR photometry. The evolution of the galaxy stellar
mass function (GSMF) in high and low density regions provides a tool to study
the mass assembly evolution in different environments; moreover, the
contributions to the GSMF from different galaxy types, as defined by their SEDs
and their morphologies, can be quantified. At redshift z~1, the GSMF is only
slightly dependent on environment, but at lower redshifts the shapes of the
GSMFs in high- and low-density environments become extremely different, with
high density regions exhibiting a marked bimodality. As a result, we infer that
galaxy evolution depends on both the stellar mass and the environment, the
latter setting the probability of a galaxy to have a given mass: all the galaxy
properties related to the stellar mass show a dependence on environment,
reflecting the difference observed in the mass functions. The shapes of the
GSMFs of early- and late-type galaxies are almost identical for the extremes of
the density contrast we consider. The evolution toward z=0 of the mass at which
the early- and late-type GSMFs match each other is more rapid in high density
environments. The comparison of the observed GSMFs to the same quantities
derived from a set of mock catalogues shows that blue galaxies in sparse
environments are overproduced in the semi-analytical models at intermediate and
high masses, because of a deficit of star formation suppression, while at z<0.5
an excess of red galaxies is present in dense environments at intermediate and
low masses, because of the overquenching of satellites. ABRIDGED

possible variance in ways that are readily implementable with current
experimental techniques. Measurements whose statistics have high-frequency
fringes, such as those obtained from NOON states, have commensurately high
information yield. However this information is also highly ambiguous because it
does not distinguish between phases at the same point on different fringes. We
provide schemes to eliminate this phase ambiguity in a highly efficient way,
providing phase estimates with uncertainty that is within a small constant
factor of the Heisenberg limit, the minimum allowed by the laws of quantum
mechanics. These techniques apply to NOON state and multi-pass interferometry,
as well as phase measurements in quantum computing. We have reported the
experimental implementation of some of these schemes with multi-pass
interferometry elsewhere. Here we present the theoretical foundation, and also
present some new experimental results. There are three key innovations to the
theory in this paper. First, we examine the intrinsic phase properties of the
sequence of states (in multiple time modes) via the equivalent two-mode state.
Second, we identify the key feature of the equivalent state that enables the
optimal scaling of the intrinsic phase uncertainty to be obtained. This enables
us to identify appropriate combinations of states to use. The remaining
difficulty is that the ideal phase measurements to achieve this intrinic phase
uncertainty are often not physically realizable. The third innovation is to
solve this problem by using realizable measurements that closely approximate
the optimal measurements, enabling the optimal scaling to be preserved.

exploiting the gravitational lensing effect for studying the large scales of

matter density distribution which is explored in this paper. We give a
generalisation of an already known minimum-variance estimator of the 3-D matter
density distribution that facilitates the combination of thin redshift slices
of sources with samples of broad redshift distributions for an optimal
reconstruction. We show how, in principle, intrinsic alignments of source
ellipticities or shear/intrinsic alignment correlations can be accommodated,
albeit these effects are not the focus of this paper. We describe an efficient
and fast way to implement the estimator on a contemporary desktop computer.
Analytic estimates for the noise and biases in the reconstruction are given.
The bias -- a spread and shift of structures in radial direction -- can be
expressed in terms of a radial PSF, comprising the limitations of the
reconstruction due to source shot-noise and the unavoidably broad lensing
kernel. We conclude that a 3-D mass-density reconstruction on galaxy cluster
scales is feasible but, for foreseeable surveys, a map with a S/N>~3 threshold
is limited to structures with M200>~10^14 Msol/h, or 7x10^14 Msol/h, at low to
moderate redshifts (z=0.1 or 0.6). However, we find that a heavily smoothed
full-sky map of the very large-scale density field may also be possible as the
S/N of reconstructed modes increases towards larger scales. Future improvements
of the method can be obtained by including higher-order lensing information
(flexion) which could also be implemented into our algorithm. [ABRIDGED]

for larger masses, underestimating the mass function by 10% (30%) at M = 3.16 x

planet's eccentricity produced by undetected outer companions. We have carried
out Monte Carlo simulations of mock RV data to understand this effect and
predict its impact on the observed distribution. We first quantify the
statistical effect of undetected outer companions and show that this alone
cannot explain the observed distribution. We then modify the simulations to
consist of two populations, one of zero-eccentricity planets in double-planet
systems and the other of single planets drawn from an eccentric distribution.
Our simulations show that a good fit to the observed distribution is obtained
with 45% zero-eccentricity double-planets and 55% single eccentric planets.
Matching the observed distribution allows us to determine the probability that
a known RV planet's orbital eccentricity has been biased by an undetected
wide-separation companion. Our simulations show that moderately-eccentric
planets, with $0.1 < e < 0.3$ and $0.1 < e < 0.2$, have a $\sim 13%$ and $\sim
19%$ probability, respectively, of having an undetected outer companion. We
encourage both high-contrast direct imaging and RV follow-up surveys of known

polydisk algebra with kernel function k(z, w) admits a unique minimal dilation
(actually an isometric co-extension) to the Hardy module over the polydisk if
and only if S^{-1}(z, w) k(z, w) is a positive kernel function, where S(z, w)
is the Szeg\""{o} kernel for the polydisk. Moreover, we establish the
equivalence of such a factorization of the kernel function and a positivity
condition, defined using the hereditary functional calculus, which was
introduced earlier by Athavale \cite{Ath} and Ambrozie, Englis and M\""{u}ller.
An explicit realization of the dilation space is given along with the isometric
embedding of the module R in it. The proof works for a wider class of Hilbert
modules in which the Hardy module is replaced by more general quasi-free
Hilbert modules such as the classical spaces on the polydisk or the unit ball
in {C}^m. Some consequences of this more general result are then explored in
the case of several natural function algebras.

NGC 205 is a peculiar dwarf elliptical galaxy hosting in its center
a population of young blue stars. Their origin is still matter of debate, the
central fresh star formation activity possibly being related to dynamical
interactions between NGC 205 and M31. Aims. The star formation history in the
central 30\arcsec ($\sim$120 pc) around the NGC 205 central nucleus is
investigated in order to obtain clues to the origin of the young stellar
population. Methods. Deep HST/ACS CCD photometry is compared with theoretical
isochrones and luminosity functions to characterize the stellar content of the
region under study and compute the recent SF rate. Results. Our photometry
reveals a previously undetected blue plume of young stars clearly
distinguishable down to I$\simeq$26. Our analysis suggests that 1.9$\times10^5$
M$_\odot$ were produced between approximately 62 Myr and 335 Myr ago in the NGC
205 inner regions, with a latest minor episode occurring $\sim$25 Myr ago. This
implies a star formation rate of $\sim7\times10^{-4}$ M$_\odot$/yr over this
period. Conclusions. The excellent fit of the observed luminosity function of
young main sequence stars obtained with a model having a constant star
formation rate argues against a tidally triggered star formation activity over
the last $\sim$300 Myr. Rather, a constant SF may be consistent with NGC 205
being on its first interaction with M 31.

radial distribution of H-alpha emission, implying that both are excellent
tracers of star formation within galaxies. Within this overall distribution we
find that there is a central deficit of SNII which is offset by a central
excess of SNIb/c. This implies a strong metallicity dependence on the relative
production of the two types, with SNIb/c arising from higher metallicity
progenitors than SNII. Separating the SNIb/c into individual classes we find
that a trend emerges in terms of progenitor metallicity going from SNII through
SNIb to SNIc, with the latter arising from the highest metallicity progenitors.

different parameterizations of a non-linear Walecka model which includes the
whole baryon octet. For the quark matter phase we use an SU(3)_f
Nambu-Jona-Lasinio effective model including color superconductivity.
Deconfinement is considered to be a first order phase transition that conserves
color and flavor. It gives a short-lived transitory colorless-quark-phase that
is not in beta-equilibrium, and decays to a stable configuration in tau ~
tau_{weak} ~ 10^{-8} s. However, in spite of being very short lived, the
transition to this intermediate phase determines the onset of the transition
inside neutron stars. We find the transition free-energy density for
temperatures typical of neutron star interiors. We also find the critical mass
above which compact stars should contain a quark core and below which they are
safe with respect to a sudden transition to quark matter. Rather independently
on the stiffness of the hadronic equation of state (EOS) we find that the
critical mass of hadronic stars (without trapped neutrinos) is in the range of
~ 1.5 - 1.8 solar masses. This is in coincidence with previous results obtained

performance) of a technology or production process. The technology can be
decomposed into $n$ components, each of which interacts with a cluster of $d-1$
other, dependent components. Innovation occurs through a series of
trial-and-error events, each of which consists of randomly changing the cost of
each component in a cluster, and accepting the changes only if the total cost
of the entire cluster is lowered. We show that the relationship between the
cost of the whole technology and the number of innovation attempts is
asymptotically a power law, matching the functional form often observed for
empirical data. The exponent $\alpha$ of the power law depends on the intrinsic
difficulty of finding better components, and on what we term the {\it design
complexity}: The more complex the design, the slower the rate of improvement.
Letting $d$ as defined above be the connectivity, in the special case in which
the connectivity is constant, the design complexity is simply the connectivity.
When the connectivity varies, bottlenecks can arise in which a few components
limit progress. In this case the design complexity is more complicated,
depending on the details of the design. The number of bottlenecks also
determines whether progress is steady, or whether there are periods of stasis
punctuated by occasional large changes. Our model connects the engineering
properties of a design to historical studies of technology improvement.

production. Entropy production is a measure of the rate of the tendency of
Nature to explore available microstates. The most important irreversible
process generating entropy in the biosphere, and thus facilitating this
exploration, is the absorption and transformation of sunlight into heat. Here
we hypothesize that life began, and persists today, as a catalyst for the
absorption and dissipation of sunlight at the surface of shallow seas. The
resulting heat is then efficiently harvested by other irreversible processes
such as the water cycle, hurricanes, and ocean and wind currents. RNA and DNA
are the most efficient of all known molecules for absorbing the intense
ultraviolet light that could have penetrated the dense early atmosphere, and
are remarkably rapid in transforming this light into heat in the presence of
liquid water. From this perspective, the origin and evolution of life,
inseparable from water and the water cycle, can be understood as resulting from
the natural thermodynamic imperative of increasing the entropy production of
the Earth in its interaction with its solar environment. A mechanism is
proposed for the reproduction of RNA and DNA without the need for enzymes,
promoted instead through UV light dissipation and the ambient conditions of
prebiotic Earth.

Herbig Be star HD100546. HD100546 has been the subject of intense scrutiny
because it is a young nearby star with a transitional disk. We observe the
Delta v=1 ro-vibrational CO transitions in order to clarify the distribution of
warm gas in the inner disk. Modeling of the CO spectrum indicates that the gas
is vibrationally excited by collisions and UV fluorescence. The observed
emission extends from 13-100AU. The inner edge of the molecular gas emission is
consistent with the inner edge of the optically thick dust disk indicating that
the inner hole is not simply a hole in the dust opacity but is likely cleared
of gas as well. The rotational temperature of the CO is ~1000K - much hotter
than the ~200K CO in the otherwise similar transitional disk surrounding
HD141569. The origin of this discrepancy is likely linked to the brighter PAH
emission observed toward HD100546. We use the excitation of the CO to constrain
the geometry of the inner disk and comment on the evolutionary state of the
system.

the white dwarf masses at supernova explosion may significantly exceed the
canonical Chandrasekhar mass limit. These massive white dwarfs may be supported
by rapid differential rotation. Based on single degenerate model and the
assumption that the white dwarf would differentially rotate when the accretion
rate $\dot{M}>3\times10^{-7}M_{\odot}\rm yr^{-1}$, we have calculated the
evolutions of close binaries consisting of a white dwarf and a normal
companion. To include the effect of rotation, we introduce an effective mass
$M_{\rm eff}$ for white dwarfs. For the donor stars with two different
metallicities $Z=0.02$ and 0.001, we present the distribution of the initial
donor star masses and the orbital periods of the progenitors of
super-Chandrasekhar mass SNe Ia. The calculation results indicate that, for an
initial massive white dwarf of $1.2M_{\odot}$, a considerable fraction of SNe
Ia may result from super-Chandresekhar mass white dwarfs, but very massive
($>1.7 M_{\sun}$) white dwarfs are difficult to form, and none of them could be
found in old populations. However, super-Chandrasekhar mass SNe Ia are very
rare when the initial mass of white dwarfs is $1.0M_{\odot}$. Additionally, SNe
Ia in low metallicity environment are more likely to be homogeneous.

categories satisfying the conditions in this paper include the category of

orbit category construction in [math/0312214]. We also extend the notion of
graded categories and show that the Grothendieck construction takes values in
the category of graded categories. Our definition of graded category does not
require any coproduct decompositions and generalizes $k$-linear graded
categories indexed by small categories defined by Lowen.

categories to the category of oplax functors. One of them is the smash product
construction defined and studied in [math/0312214,0807.4706,0905.3884] for

component of its atmosphere, referred to as the CO-mosphere, with the use of
the IR spectral atlas by Hinkle et al.(1995). The nature of CO lines shows an
abrupt change at logW/nu = -4.75, and the lines stronger than this limit can no
longer be analyzed by the classical line-formation theory. A more simple
manifestation of this fact is that the curves-of-growth (CG) of CO lines show
an unpredictable upturn at logW/nu = -4.75. Similar unusual behaviors of
empirical CG are confirmed in other red (super)giant stars, and it looks as if
the CG is a hybrid of at least two components of different origins. Although
strong lines of the CO fundamentals observed in Arcturus show strengthening
compared with the predicted photospheric spectrum, the weaker lines show slight
weakening, and we interpret these results as due to absorption/emission by the
molecular clouds formed in the extended atmosphere. Now do clouds exist in
stellar atmospheres? It is by no means easy to answer this question by
spectroscopic observations alone, but we find several arguments in favor of
such a possibility in Arcturus by analyzing the CO lines. In cooler
(super)giant stars in which CO lines show similar unusual behaviors as in
Arcturus, the presence of molecular clouds in the outer atmospheres was
demonstrated by direct observations with spatial interferometry. We suggest
that the formation of molecular clouds is a general feature in cool luminous
stars from early K to late M (super)giant stars.

system. In such a system, maximal or near maximal utilization of constrained
resources is of extreme importance. Manual TEWA systems cannot provide
optimality because of different limitations e.g.surface to air missile (SAM)
can fire from a distance of 5Km, but manual TEWA systems are constrained by
human vision range and other constraints. Current TEWA systems usually work on

population, caused by intrinsic (demographic) noise. Extinction typically
occurs via one of two scenarios depending on whether the absorbing state n=0 is
a repelling (scenario A) or attracting (scenario B) point of the deterministic
rate equation. In scenario A the metastable stochastic population resides in
the vicinity of an attracting fixed point next to the repelling point n=0. In
scenario B there is an intermediate repelling point n=n_1 between the
attracting point n=0 and another attracting point n=n_2 in the vicinity of
which the metastable population resides. The crux of the theory is WKB method
which assumes that the typical population size in the metastable state is
large. Starting from the master equation, we calculate the quasi-stationary
probability distribution of the population sizes and the (exponentially long)
mean time to extinction for each of the two scenarios. When necessary, the WKB
approximation is complemented (i) by a recursive solution of the
quasi-stationary master equation at small n and (ii) by the van Kampen
system-size expansion, valid near the fixed points of the deterministic rate
equation. The theory yields both entropic barriers to extinction and
pre-exponential factors, and holds for a general set of multi-step processes
when detailed balance is broken. The results simplify considerably for
single-step processes and near the characteristic bifurcations of scenarios A

dimension, surface fractal dimension, entropy, enthalpy, free energies,
hydrophobicity, denaturation temperature etc..), which are inherently
statistical in nature. These general indices emerge from innumerable (innately
context-dependent and time-dependent) interactions between various atoms of a
protein. Many a studies have been performed on the nature of these inter-atomic
interactions and the change of profile of atomic fluctuations that they cause.
However, we still do not know, under a given context, for a given duration of
time, how does a macroscopic biophysical property emerge from the cumulative
inter-atomic interactions. An exact answer to that question will involve
bridging the gap between nano-scale distinguishable atomic description and
macroscopic indistinguishable (statistical) measures, along the mesoscopic
scale of observation. In this work we propose a computationally implementable
mathematical model that derives expressions for observability of emergence of a
macroscopic biophysical property from a set of interacting (fluctuating) atoms.
Since most of the aforementioned interactions are non-linear in nature;
observability criteria are derived for both linear and the non-linear
descriptions of protein interior. The study assumes paramount importance in
21st-century biology, from both the theoretical and practical utilitarian point
of view.

characterise the corresponding discrete stability property of point processes.
It is shown that these processes are exactly Cox (doubly stochastic Poisson)
processes with strictly stable random intensity measures. We give spectral and
LePage representations for general strictly stable random measures without
assuming their independent scattering. As a consequence, spectral
representations are obtained for the probability generating functional and void
probabilities of discrete stable processes. An alternative cluster
representation for such processes is also derived using the so-called Sibuya
point processes, which constitute a new family of purely random point
processes. The obtained results are then applied to explore stable random
elements in discrete semigroups, where the scaling is defined by means of
thinning of a point process on the basis of the semigroup. Particular examples
include discrete stable vectors that generalise discrete stable random
variables and the family of natural numbers with the multiplication operation,

campaign, as well as from the public Swift/BAT, XRT, and UVOT data of GRB
060111B for which a bright optical emission was measured with good temporal
resolution during the prompt phase. We identified the host galaxy at R~25 mag;
its featureless spectral continuum and brightness, as well as the non-detection
of any associated supernova 16 days after the trigger and other independent
redshift estimates, converge to z~1-2. From the analysis of the early afterglow
SED, we find that non-negligible host galaxy dust extinction, in addition to
the Galactic one, affects the observed flux in the optical regime. The
extinction-corrected optical-to-gamma-ray spectral energy distribution during
the prompt emission shows a flux density ratio $F_{\gamma}/F_{opt}$=0.01-0.0001
with spectral index $\beta_{\gamma,opt}> \beta_{\gamma}$, strongly suggesting a
separate origin of the optical and gamma-ray components. This result is
supported by the lack of correlated behavior in the prompt emission light
curves observed in the two energy domains. The properties of the prompt optical
emission observed during GRB 060111B favor interpretation of this optical light
as radiation from the reverse shock in a thick shell limit and in the slow
cooling regime. The expected peak flux is consistent with the observed one
corrected for the host extinction, likely indicating that the starting time of
the TAROT observations is very near to or coincident with the peak time. The
estimated fireball initial Lorentz factor is >260-360 at z=1-2, similar to the
Lorentz factors obtained from other GRBs. GRB 060111B is a rare, good test case
of the reverse shock emission mechanism in both the X-ray and optical energy
ranges.

There are several models that predict the existence of heavy colored resonances

experimentally challenging, because it requires selecting data samples where
top and antitop quarks are highly boosted. Nonetheless, the production of such

quarks. We consider a toy model with general flavour independent couplings of
the resonance to quarks, of both vector and axial-vector kind. The charge

the amount of leakage, thus impacting on the eventual production of iron group
elements. Because of its high abundance, 40Ca can also play a secondary role as
""neutron poison"" for the s-process. Previous determinations of this value at
stellar energies were based on time-of-flight measurements. Our method uses an
independent approach, and yields for the Maxwellian-averaged cross section at

theorem (QET) of 1929, a strong result arising from the mere mathematical
structure of quantum mechanics. The QET is a precise formulation of what we
call normal typicality, i.e., the statement that, for typical large systems,
every initial wave function $\psi_0$ from an energy shell is ""normal"": it
evolves in such a way that $|\psi_t> <\psi_t|$ is, for most $t$,
macroscopically equivalent to the micro-canonical density matrix. The QET has
been mostly forgotten after it was criticized as a dynamically vacuous
statement in several papers in the 1950s. However, we point out that this
criticism does not apply to the actual QET, a correct statement of which does
not appear in these papers, but to a different (indeed weaker) statement.
Furthermore, we formulate a stronger statement of normal typicality, based on
the observation that the bound on the deviations from the average specified by
von Neumann is unnecessarily coarse and a much tighter (and more relevant)
bound actually follows from his proof.

investigated as a function of relative humidity and shown to be a novel and
sensitive means for probing the growth and properties of a water meniscus in
the nm-scale. An empirical model of the light emission process is formulated
and applied successfully to replicate the decay in light intensity and spectral
changes observed with increasing relative humidity. The modelling indicates a
progressive water filling of the tip-sample junction with increasing humidity
or, more pertinently, of the volume of the localized surface plasmons
responsible for light emission; it also accounts for the effect of asymmetry in
structuring of the water molecules with respect to polarity of the applied
bias. This is juxtaposed with the case of a non-polar liquid in the tip-sample
nano cavity where no polarity dependence of the light emission is observed. In
contrast to the discrete detection of the presence/absence of water bridge in
other scanning probe experiments by measurement of the feedback parameter for
instrument control LESTM offers a means of continuously monitoring the
development of the water bridge with sub-nm sensitivity. The results are
relevant to applications such as dip-pen nanolithography and electrochemical
scanning probe microscopy.

measure the number density of galaxies down to low stellar mass (10^9-10^10
Msun) even at high redshift with high statistical accuracy. The normalization
of the mass function decreases with redshift and the integrated stellar mass
density becomes ~ 8-18% of the local value at z~2 and ~ 4-9% at z~3, which are
consistent with results of previous studies in general fields. Furthermore, we
found that the low-mass slope becomes steeper with redshift from alpha ~- 1.3
at z~1 to alpha ~- 1.6 at z~3, and that the evolution of the number density of
low-mass (10^9-10^10 Msun) galaxies is weaker than that of M* (~10^11 Msun)
galaxies. This indicates that the contribution of low-mass galaxies to the
total stellar mass density has been significant at high redshift. The
steepening of the low-mass slope with redshift is opposite trend expected from
the stellar mass dependence of the specific star formation rate reported in
previous studies. The present result suggests that the hierarchical merging
process overwhelmed the effect of the stellar mass growth by star formation and
was very important for the stellar mass assembly of these galaxies at 1<~z<~3.

interacting, enabling tests of nonperturbative many-body theories in a variety

the entropy and energy of this model system, providing a benchmark for
calculations of the thermodynamics. Our experiments on the expansion of
rotating strongly interacting Fermi gases in the normal fluid regime reveal
extremely low viscosity hydrodynamics. Combining the thermodynamic and
hydrodynamic measurements enables an estimate of the ratio of the shear
viscosity to the entropy density. A strongly interacting Fermi gas in the

history of results which give partial answers to this problem, but there are
still questions which remain unknown. The Duffin-Schaeffer Conjecture is an
attempt to answer all of these questions in full, and it has withstood more
than fifty years of mathematical investigation. In this paper we establish a
strong connection between the Duffin-Schaeffer Conjecture and its p-adic
analogue. Our main theorems are transfer principles which allow us to go back
and forth between these two problems. We prove that if the variance method from
probability theory can be used to solve the p-adic Duffin-Schaeffer Conjecture
for even one prime p, then almost the entire classical Duffin-Schaeffer
Conjecture would follow. Conversely if the variance method can be used to prove
the classical conjecture then the p-adic conjecture is true for all primes.
Furthermore we are able to unconditionally and completely establish the higher
dimensional analogue of this conjecture in which we allow simultaneous
approximation in any finite number and combination of real and p-adic fields,
as long as the total number of fields involved is greater than one. Finally by
using a mass transference principle for Hausdorff measures we are able to
extend all of our results to their corresponding analogues with Haar measures

function, u(q), whose infrared behavior has traditionally served as the
standard criterion for the realization of the Kugo-Ojima confinement mechanism.
It turns out that, in the Landau gauge, u(q) can be determined from a dynamical
equation, whose main ingredients are the gluon propagator and the ghost
dressing function, integrated over all physical momenta. Using as input for
these two (infrared finite) quantities recent lattice data, we obtain an
indirect determination of u(q). The results of this mixed procedure are in
excellent agreement with those found previously on the lattice, through a
direct simulation of this function. Most importantly, in the deep infrared the
function deviates considerably from the value associated with the realization
of the aforementioned confinement scenario. In addition, the dependence of
u(q), and especially of its value at the origin, on the renormalization point
is clearly established. Some of the possible implications of these results are
briefly discussed.

the dynamic conformational freedom in molecular devices opens up the
possibility of using molecules as new types of devices such as a molecular
conformational switch or for molecular data storage. Bistable molecules, with
e.g. two stable cis and trans isomeric configurations, could provide, once
clamped between two electrodes, a switching phenomenon in the nonequilibrium
current response. Here, we model molecular switch junctions formed at silicon
contacts and demonstrate the potential of tunable molecular switches in
electrode/molecule/electrode configurations. Using the non equilibrium Green
function approach implemented with the density-functional-based tight-binding
theory, a series of properties such as electron transmissions, I-V
characteristics in the different isomer-conformations, and potential energy
surfaces as a function of the reaction coordinates along the trans to cis
transition were calculated. Furthermore, in order to investigate stability of
molecular switches in ambient conditions, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
at room temperature were performed and time- dependent fluctuations of the
conductance along the MD pathways were calculated. Our numerical results show
that the transmission spectra of the cis isomers are more conductive than trans
counterparts inside the bias window for all two model molecules. The
current-voltage characteristics consequently show the same trends.
Additionally, the calculations of time-dependent transmission fluctuations
along the MD pathways have shown that the transmission in cis isomers is always
significantly larger than that of trans counterparts showing that molecular
switches can be expected to work as robust molecular switching components.

orthogonal polynomials. They are described by a Riemann-Hilbert matrix Y

we show that det Y_{1,1} (det Y_{2,2}) equals the average characteristic

probabilistic ensemble that is associated to the MOP. In this way we generalize
classical results for orthogonal polynomials, and also some recent results for
MOP of type I and type II. We then extend our results to arbitrary products and
ratios of characteristic polynomials. In the latter case an important role is
played by a matrix-valued version of the Christoffel-Darboux kernel. Our proofs
use determinantal identities involving Schur complements, and adaptations of
the classical results by Heine, Christoffel and Uvarov.

distribution amplitude, k_T being a parton transverse momentum. The low Q^2

  Using interferometric data from the WSRT and the VLA we study HI emission at
low-, intermediate- and high radial velocities along four lines of sight
towards quasars. Along these sightlines we previously detected weak CaII and
NaI absorbers in their optical spectra.
  The analysis of the high-resolution HI data reveals the presence of several
compact and cold clumps of neutral gas at velocities similar to the optical
absorption. The clumps have narrow HI line widths in the range of 1.8 to 13
km/s, yielding upper limits for the kinetic temperature of the gas of 70 to
3700 K. The neutral gas has low HI column densities in the range of 5E18 to
3E19 1/cm^2. All clumps have angular sizes of only a few arcminutes.
  Our high-resolution 21-cm observations indicate that many of the CaII and NaI
absorbers seen in our optical quasar spectra are associated with low-column
density HI clumps at small angular scales. This suggests that next to the
massive, high-column density neutral gas clouds in the halo (the common 21-cm
LVCs, IVCs, and HVCs) there exists a population of low-mass, neutral gas
structures in the halo that remain mostly unseen in the existing 21-cm all-sky
surveys of IVCs and HVCs. The estimated thermal gas pressures of the detected
HI clumps are consistent with what is expected from theoretical models of gas
in the inner and outer Milky Way halo.

the violation of LG inequalities excludes the hidden-variable description based

of LG inequalities becomes weaker with the increase of interaction time in the

the first intrinsic examination of stellar spectra from the RAVE survey, aimed
at evaluating their diagnostic potential for peculiar stars and at contributing
to the general understanding of Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs). METHODS: We
used the multi-epoch spectra for all seven LBVs observed, between 2005 and
2008, in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) by the RAVE survey. RESULTS: We
demonstrate that RAVE spectra possess significant diagnostic potential when
applied to peculiar stars and, in particular, LBVs. The behaviour of the radial
velocities for both emission and absorption lines, and the spectral changes
between outburst and quiescence states are described and found to agree with
evidence gathered at more conventional wavelengths. The wind outflow signatures
and their variability are investigated, with multi-components detected in S
Doradus. Photoionisation modelling of the rich emission line spectrum of R 127
shows evidence of a massive detached ionised shell that was ejected during the
1982-2000 outburst. Surface inhomogeneities in the nuclear-processed material,
brought to the surface by heavy mass loss, could have been observed in S
Doradus, even if alternative explanations are possible. We also detect the
transition from quiescence to outburst state in R 71. Finally, our spectrum of
R 84 offers one of the clearest views of its cool companion.

interactions between localizable particles. For this reason the actual
formalism of QFT is partly based on a suitable generalization of the one
already used for systems of point particles. This circumstance gives rise to a
number of conceptual problems, stemming essentially from the fact that the
existence within QFT of non-equivalent representations implies the existence of
field theories allowing, within the same theory, different, inequivalent,
descriptions of particles. This led some authors to claim that in QFT the
concept itself of particle should be abandoned. In this paper we will shortly
discuss the validity of this claim, as well as the possibilities, so far
existing, of building alternative versions of QFT, not designed in advance to
allow some kind of particle representation. We will also spend some words about
the generalizations of the concept itself of particle which could grant for a
better cohabitation of particles and fields within a wider formulation of QFT.
The latter is indispensable if we want to extend the range of application of
QFT from particle physics or simple condensed matter physics to other domains
of scientific research.

the remaining emission is dominated by the underlying galactic bulge
contribution. We also find a blue component whose nature is not clear in 4 out

AGN, to a young stellar population in unresolved star clusters, or to
early-disrupted clusters. Star forming regions and/or bright off-nuclear star

  In the theoretical part 35 candidate-crystals both pure and two-components
are considered. Their peak reflectivity at 100 keV, 500 keV and 1 MeV is
calculated assuming they are mosaic crystals. It results that a careful
selection of crystals can allow a reflectivity above 30% over the whole energy
range, and even reaching 40% in its lower part. Experimentally, we concentrated
on three different materials (Si_{1-x}Ge_x with gradient of composition, mosaic
Cu and Au) that have been measured both at ESRF and ILL using
highly-monochromatic beams ranging from 300 keV up to 816 keV. The aim was to
check their homogeneity, quality and angular spread (mosaicity). These crystals
have shown outstanding performance such as reflectivity up to 31% at ~600 keV
(Au) or 60% at 300 keV (SiGe) and angular spread as low as 15 arcsec for Cu,
fulfilling very well the requirements for a Laue lens application.
Unexpectedly, we also noticed important discrepancies with Darwin's model when
a crystal is measured using various energies.

D.)--University of Washington, 2007",,,"physics.atom-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Single trapped ions are ideal systems in which to test atomic physics at high
precision: they are effectively isolated atoms held at rest and largely free
from perturbing interactions. This thesis describes several projects developed
to study the structure of singly-ionized barium and more fundamental physics.
  First, we describe a spin-dependent ""electron-shelving"" scheme that allows us
to perform single ion electron spin resonance experiments in both the ground
6S_{1/2} and metastable 5D_{3/2} states at precision levels of 10^{-5}. We
employ this technique to measure the ratio of off-resonant light shifts (or
ac-Stark effect) in these states to a precision of 10^{-3} at two different
wavelengths. These results constitute a new high precision test of heavy-atom
atomic theory. Such experimental tests in Ba+ are in high demand since
knowledge of key dipole matrix elements is currently limited to about 5%. Ba+
has recently been the subject of theoretical interest towards a test of atomic
parity violation for which knowledge of dipole matrix elements is an important
prerequisite. We summarize this parity violation experimental concept and
describe new ideas. (continued...)
