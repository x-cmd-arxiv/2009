that appear only in a sector of certain theories (""emergent dualities""), can be
unveiled, and systematically established. Our method relies on the use of
morphisms of the ""bond algebra"" of a quantum Hamiltonian. Dualities are
characterized as unitary mappings implementing such morphisms, whose even
powers become symmetries of the quantum problem. Dual variables -which were
guessed in the past- can be derived in our formalism. We obtain new
self-dualities for four-dimensional Abelian gauge field theories.

Principle (EP) that is not satisfied by standard semiclassical gravity. In the
theory that we are conjecturing, the vacuum expectation value of the (bare)
energy momentum tensor is exactly the same as in flat space: quartically
divergent with the cut-off and with no spacetime dependent (subleading) ter ms.
The presence of such terms seems in fact related to some known difficulties,
such as the black hole information loss and the cosmological constant problem.
Since the terms that we want to get rid of are subleading in the high-momentum
expansion, we attempt to explore the conjectured theory by ""IR-completing"" GR.
We consider a scalar field in a flat FRW Universe and isolate the first
IR-correction to its Fourier modes operators that kills the quadratic (next to
leading) time dependent divergence of the stress energy tensor VEV. Analogously
to other modifications of field operators that have been proposed in the
literature (typically in the UV), the present approach seems to suggest a
breakdown (here, in the IR, at large distances) of the metric manifold
description. We show that corrections to GR are in fact very tiny, become
effective at distances comparable to the inverse curvature and do not contain
any adjustable parameter. Finally, we derive some cosmological implications. By
studying the consistency of the canonical commutation relations, we infer a
correction to the distance between two comoving observers, which grows as the
scale factor only when small compared to the Hubble length, but gets relevant
corrections otherwise. The corrections to cosmological distance measures are
also calculable and, for a spatially flat matter dominated Universe, go in the
direction of an effective positive acceleration.

important diagnostic in weak gravitational lensing. However, commonly used
techniques to perform this separation suffer from mode-mixing on very small or
very large scales. We introduce a new E-/B-mode decomposition of the cosmic
shear two-point correlation on a finite interval. This new statistic is
optimised for cosmological applications, by maximising the signal-to-noise
ratio (S/N) and a figure of merit (FoM) based on the Fisher matrix of the
cosmological parameters Omega_m and sigma_8.
  We improve both S/N and FoM results substantially with respect to the
recently introduced ring statistic, which also provides E-/B-mode separation on
a finite angular range. The S/N (FoM) is larger by a factor of three (two) on
angular scales between 1 and 220 arc minutes. In addition, it yields better
results than for the aperture-mass dispersion <M_ap>^2, with improvements of
20% (10%) for S/N (FoM). Our results depend on the survey parameters, most
importantly on the covariance of the two-point shear correlation function.
Although we assume parameters according to the CFHTLS-Wide survey, our method
and optimisation scheme can be applied easily to any given survey settings and
observing parameters. Arbitrary quantities, with respect to which the E-/B-mode
filter is optimised, can be defined, therefore generalising the aim and context
of the new shear statistic.

features above the magnetic network are further investigated by using a wavelet
analysis. Our results reveal that, in both the 171 A and 1600 A passbands,
oscillations above the magnetic network show a lack of power at high
frequencies (5.0-8.3 mHz), and a significant power at low (1.3-2.0 mHz) and
intermediate frequencies (2.6-4.0 mHz). The global 5-min oscillation is clearly
present in the 4 analyzed features when seen in the 1600 A passband, and is
also found with enhanced power in feature 1 (leg of a large coronal loop) and
feature 2 (legs of a coronal bright point loop) when seen in the 171 A
passband. Two features above an enhanced network element (feature 3 and feature
4) show repeated propagating behaviors with a dominant period of 10 min and 5
min, respectively. We suggest these oscillations are likely to be slow
magneto-acoustic waves propagating along inclined magnetic field lines, from
the lower solar atmosphere into the corona. The energy flux carried by these
waves is estimated of the order of 40 erg cm\^{-2} s\^{-1} for the 171 A
passband and is far lower than the energy required to heat the quiet corona.
For the 1600 A passband, the energy flux is about 1.4*10^6 erg cm\^{-2}
s\^{-1}, which is about one third of the required energy budget for the
chromosphere.

tidally perturbed Schwarzschild metrics, we generate approximate initial data
(in the form of a 4-metric) for a nonspinning black hole binary in a circular
orbit. We carry out this matching through O(v^4) in the binary's orbital
velocity v, so the resulting data are conformally curved. Far from the holes,
we use the appropriate PN metric that accounts for retardation, which we
construct using the highest-order PN expressions available to compute the
binary's past history. The data set's uncontrolled remainders are thus O(v^5)
throughout the timeslice; we also generate an extension to the data set that
has uncontrolled remainders of O(v^6) in the purely PN portion of the timeslice
(i.e., not too close to the holes). The resulting data are smooth, since we
join all the metrics together by smoothly interpolating between them. We
perform this interpolation using transition functions constructed to avoid
introducing excessive additional constraint violations. Due to their inclusion
of tidal deformations and outgoing radiation, these data should substantially
reduce the initial spurious (""junk"") radiation observed in current simulations
that use conformally flat initial data. Such reductions in the nonphysical
components of the initial data will be necessary for simulations to achieve the
accuracy required to supply Advanced LIGO and LISA with the templates necessary

theories (QFT's) on the Moyal plane. Such theories violate causality which
influences the properties of these theories. In particular, causality
influences the fluctuation-dissipation theorem: as we show, a disturbance in a
space-time region $M_1$ creates a response in a space-time region $M_2$
space-like with respect to $M_1$ ($M_1\times M_2$). The relativistic Kubo
formula with and without noncommutativity is discussed in detail, and the
modified properties of relaxation time and the dependence of mean square
fluctuations on time are derived. In particular, the Sinha-Sorkin result
\cite{sorkin-sinha} on the logarithmic time dependence of the mean square
fluctuations is discussed in our context.
  We derive an exact formula for the noncommutative susceptibility in terms of
the susceptibility for the corresponding commutative case. It shows that
noncommutative corrections in the four-momentum space have remarkable
periodicity properties as a function of the four-momentum $k$. They have
direction dependence as well and vanish for certain directions of the spatial
momentum. These are striking observable signals for noncommutativity. The
Lehmann representation is also generalized to any value of the noncommutativity
parameter $\theta^{\mu\nu}$ and finite temperatures.

geometric illustrations of the state space that emphasize the difference
between entanglement and quantum nonlocality. Namely, it is found that the
shape of the boundaries of separability and Bell inequality violation are
essentially different. Moreover, it is shown that also for mixtures of states

entanglement measures are non-monotonically related.

(poly(acrylic acid)) were used as nanometer-thick adlayers for cerium (CeO2)
and iron (gamma-Fe2O3) oxide nanoparticles. The organic functionalities were
adsorbed on the particle surfaces via physical (electrostatic) forces.
Stability assays at high ionic strength and in cell culture media were
performed by static and dynamic light scattering. Among the three coating
examined, we found that only poly(acrylic acid) fully preserved the dispersion
stability on the long term (> weeks). The improved stability was explained by
the multi-point attachments of the chains onto the particle surface, and by the
adlayer-mediated electrosteric interactions. These results suggest that
anionically charged polymers represent an effective alternative to conventional

The anticipated increase of intra-jet multiplicities, energy loss of the

electrostatics of the GNRs. In turn, the failure of the classical
electrostatics is traced to the quantum mechanical effects leading to the
significant modification of the self-consistent charge distribution in
comparison to the non-interacting electron description. The role of
electron-electron interaction in the electronic structure and the capacitance

to a given airport, and two nodes are connected by means of flight routes. Each
node is weighted according to its load capacity, and links are weighted
according to the Euclidean distance that separates each pair of nodes. Local
rules describing the behavior of individual nodes in terms of the surrounding
flow have been also modelled, and a random network topology has been chosen in
a baseline approach. Numerical simulations describing the diffusion of a given
number of agents (aircraft) in this network show the onset of a jamming
transition that distinguishes an efficient regime with null amount of airport
queues and high diffusivity (free phase) and a regime where bottlenecks
suddenly take place, leading to a poor aircraft diffusion (congested phase).
Fluctuations are maximal around the congestion threshold, suggesting that the

to be scale-free. The jamming transition is also observed in this case. These

$k$ identical spherical Gaussians in $n$-dimensional space with an arbitrarily
small separation between the components. Our algorithm is polynomial in all
parameters other than $k$. The algorithm is based on an appropriate grid search
over the space of parameters. The theoretical analysis of the algorithm hinges
on a reduction of the problem to 1 dimension and showing that two 1-dimensional
mixtures whose densities are close in the $L^2$ norm must have similar means
and mixing coefficients. To produce such a lower bound for the $L^2$ norm in
terms of the distances between the corresponding means, we analyze the behavior
of the Fourier transform of a mixture of Gaussians in 1 dimension around the
origin, which turns out to be closely related to the properties of the
Vandermonde matrix obtained from the component means. Analysis of this matrix
together with basic function approximation results allows us to provide a lower
bound for the norm of the mixture in the Fourier domain.
  In recent years much research has been aimed at understanding the
computational aspects of learning parameters of Gaussians mixture distributions
in high dimension. To the best of our knowledge all existing work on learning
parameters of Gaussian mixtures assumes minimum separation between components
of the mixture which is an increasing function of either the dimension of the
space $n$ or the number of components $k$. In our paper we prove the first
result showing that parameters of a $n$-dimensional Gaussian mixture model with
arbitrarily small component separation can be learned in time polynomial in

N(H0)=22.10 DLA system located in the host galaxy of GRB 050730. The
time-dependent evolution of the observed Fe+ energy-level populations is
modelled by assuming the excitation mechanism is fluorescence following
excitation by ultraviolet photons. This UV pumping model successfully
reproduces the observations, yielding a burst/cloud distance (defined to the
near-side of the cloud) of d=440\pm 30 pc and a linear cloud size of
l=520{+240}{-190} pc. We discuss these results in the context of no detections
of H2 and CI lines in a sample of seven z>1.8 GRB host galaxies observed with
VLT/UVES. We show that the lack of H2 can be explained by the low
metallicities, [X/H]<-1, low depletion factors and, at most, moderate particle
densities of the systems. This points to a picture where GRB-DLAs typically
exhibiting very high H0 column densities are diffuse metal-poor atomic clouds
with high kinetic temperatures, Tkin>~1000 K, and large physical extents,
l>~100 pc. The properties of GRB-DLAs observed at high spectral resolution
towards bright GRB afterglows differ markedly from the high metal and dust
contents of GRB-DLAs observed at lower resolution. This difference likely
results from the effect of a bias, against systems of high metallicity and/or
close to the GRB, due to dust obscuration in the magnitude-limited GRB
afterglow samples observed with high-resolution spectrographs.

subset of items from a large population while efficiently reducing the total
number of tests (measurements). The key contribution of this paper is in
adopting a new information-theoretic perspective on group testing problems. We
formulate the group testing problem as a channel coding/decoding problem and
derive a single-letter characterization for the total number of tests used to
identify the defective set. Although the focus of this paper is primarily on
group testing, our main result is generally applicable to other compressive
sensing models.
  The single letter characterization is shown to be order-wise tight for many
interesting noisy group testing scenarios. Specifically, we consider an
additive Bernoulli($q$) noise model where we show that, for $N$ items and $K$
defectives, the number of tests $T$ is $O(\frac{K\log N}{1-q})$ for arbitrarily
small average error probability and $O(\frac{K^2\log N}{1-q})$ for a worst case
error criterion. We also consider dilution effects whereby a defective item in
a positive pool might get diluted with probability $u$ and potentially missed.
In this case, it is shown that $T$ is $O(\frac{K\log N}{(1-u)^2})$ and
$O(\frac{K^2\log N}{(1-u)^2})$ for the average and the worst case error
criteria, respectively. Furthermore, our bounds allow us to verify existing
known bounds for noiseless group testing including the deterministic noise-free
case and approximate reconstruction with bounded distortion. Our proof of
achievability is based on random coding and the analysis of a Maximum
Likelihood Detector, and our information theoretic lower bound is based on
Fano's inequality.

among the nodes. Existing incentive based approaches are based on the VCG
(Vickrey-Clarke-Groves) mechanism which leads to high levels of incentive
budgets and restricted applicability to only certain topologies of networks.
Moreover, the existing approaches have only focused on unicast and multicast.
Motivated by this, we propose an incentive based broadcast protocol that
satisfies Bayesian incentive compatibility and minimizes the incentive budgets
required by the individual nodes. The proposed protocol, which we call {\em
BIC-B} (Bayesian incentive compatible broadcast) protocol, also satisfies
budget balance. We also derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the

ionization for the 1908 Tunguska airburst event and nitrate enhancement in
GISP2H and GISP2 ice cores, plus an unexplained ammonium spike. We then
consider a candidate cometary impact at the Younger Dryas onset (YD). The large
estimated NO_x production and O_3 depletion are beyond accurate extrapolation,
but the ice core peak is much lower, possibly because of insufficient sampling
resolution. Ammonium and nitrate spikes have been attributed to biomass burning
at YD onset in both GRIP and GISP2 ice cores. A similar result is well-resolved
in Tunguska ice core data, but that forest fire was far too small to account
for this. Direct input of ammonia from a comet into the atmosphere is adequate
for YD ice core data, but not Tunguska data. An analog of the Haber process
with hydrogen contributed by cometary or surface water, atmospheric nitrogen,
high pressures, and possibly catalytic iron from a comet could in principle
produce ammonia, accounting for the peaks in both data sets.

hydrogen Lyman-alpha and Lyman-beta lines, which were obtained
quasi-simultaneously in a raster scan near disk center. The self-reversal
depths of the Ly-a and Ly-b profiles are quantified by measuring the maximum
spectral radiances of the two horns and the minimum spectral radiance of the
central reversal. The information on the asymmetries of the Ly-a and Ly-b
profiles is obtained through the calculation of the 1st and 3rd-order moments
of the line profiles. We find that the emissions of the Lyman lines tend to be
more strongly absorbed in the internetwork, as compared to those in the network
region. Almost all of the Ly-a profiles are self-reversed, whilst about 17% of
the Ly-b profiles are not reversed. The ratio of Ly-a and Ly-b intensities
seems to be independent of the magnetic field strength. Most Ly-a profiles are
stronger in the blue horn, while most Ly-b profiles are stronger in the red
horn. However, the opposite asymmetries of Ly-a and Ly-b are not pixel-to-pixel
correlated. We also confirm that when larger transition-region downflows are
present, the Ly-a and Ly-b profiles are more enhanced in the blue and red
horns, respectively. The first-order moment of Ly-b, which reflects the
combined effects of the profile asymmetry and motion of the emitting material,
strongly correlates with the Doppler shifts of the Si iii and O vi lines,
whilst for Ly-a this correlation is much weaker. Our analysis shows that both
Ly-a and Ly-b might be more redshifted if larger transition-region downflows
are present. We also find that the observed average Ly-b profile is redshifted
with respect to its rest position.

In the dispersion plots, we divided the entire scanned region into a bright and
a dark part according to an image of Fe xii; we plotted intensities and Doppler
shifts in each bin as determined according to a filtered intensity of Si ii. We
also studied the difference in height variations of the magnetic field as
extrapolated from the MDI magnetogram, in and outside network. For the
average-profile study, we selected 74 individual cases and derived the average
profiles of intensities and Doppler shifts across the network. The dispersion
plots reveal that the intensities of Si ii and C iv increase from network
boundary to network center in both parts. However, the intensity of Ne viii
shows different trends, namely increasing in the bright part and decreasing in
the dark part. In both parts, the Doppler shift of C iv increases steadily from
internetwork to network center. The average-profile study reveals that the
intensities of the three lines all decline from the network center to

correlation. We also find that the large blue shift of Ne viii does not
coincide with large red shift of C iv. Our results suggest that the network

radio maps at 1.1mm, 1.3mm and 2.7mm, and the spectral energy distribution
(SED) from 0.9 microns to 3mm. New photometric and spectroscopic data from the
Spitzer Space Telescope and the Caltech Submilimeter Observatory have been

transfer code MC3D, the model we construct is able to discriminate parameter
sets and dust properties of both its parts, namely envelope and disc. We find
that the disc has an inner hole with a radius of 45 +/- 5 AU. Based on a dust
model including silicate and graphite the maximum grain size needed to
reproduce the spectral millimetre index is 2.5 microns. Features seen in the
near-infrared images, dominated by scattered light, can be described as a
result of a rotating envelope. Successful employment of ISM dust in both the
disc and envelope hint that grain growth may not yet play a significant role
for the appearance of this system. A larger inner hole gives rise to the
assumption that CB 26 is a circumbinary disc.

megamaser emission. Both SMM J14011+0252 and SMM J16359+6612 have
multi-wavelength characteristics consistent with ongoing starburst activity, as
well as CO line emission indicating the presence of warm molecular gas. Our
observations do not reveal any evidence for H2O megamaser emission in either
target, while the lensing allows us to obtain deep limits to the H_2O line
luminosities, L(H2O) < 7470 Lsun (3-sigma) in the case of SMM J14011+0252, and
L(H2O) < 1893 Lsun for SMM J16359+6612, assuming linewidths of 80 km/s. Our
search for, and subsequent non-detection of H2O megamaser emission in two
strongly lensed starburst galaxies, rich in gas and dust, suggests that such
megamaser emission is not likely to be common within the unlensed population of
high-redshift starburst galaxies. We use the recent detection of strong H2O

millimetre-wavelength survey undertaken to date. These results are derived from
maps covering over 0.7 deg^2, made at 1.1mm, using the AzTEC continuum camera

fields originally targeted at 0.85mm with SCUBA in the SHADES project, namely
the Lockman Hole East (mapped to a depth of 0.9-1.3 mJy rms) and the Subaru XMM
Deep Field (1.0-1.7 mJy rms). The wealth of existing and forthcoming deep
multi-frequency data in these two fields will allow the bright mm source
population revealed by these images to be explored in detail in subsequent
papers. Here we present the maps themselves, a catalogue of 114
high-significance sub-millimetre galaxy detections, and a thorough statistical
analysis leading to the most robust determination to date of the 1.1mm source
number counts. Through careful comparison, we find that both the COSMOS and
GOODS North fields, also imaged with AzTEC, contain an excess of mm sources
over the new 1.1mm source-count baseline established here. In particular, our
new AzTEC/SHADES results indicate that very luminous high-redshift dust
enshrouded starbursts (S_{1.1} > 3 mJy) are 25-50% less common than would have
been inferred from these smaller surveys, thus highlighting the potential roles
of cosmic variance and clustering in such measurements. We compare number count
predictions from recent models of the evolving mm/sub-mm source population to
these SMG surveys, which provide important constraints for the ongoing
refinement of semi-analytic and hydrodynamical models of galaxy formation, and
find that all recent models over-predict the number of bright sub-millimetre

resolve the shortcomings of existing Monte Carlo algorithms when sampling from

The method provides a fully automated adaptation mechanism that circumvents the
costly pilot runs required to tune proposal densities for Metropolis-Hastings
or indeed Hybrid Monte Carlo and Metropolis Adjusted Langevin Algorithms. This
allows for highly efficient sampling even in very high dimensions where
different scalings may be required for the transient and stationary phases of
the Markov chain. The proposed method exploits the Riemannian structure of the
parameter space of statistical models and thus automatically adapts to the
local manifold structure at each step based on the metric tensor. A
semi-explicit second order symplectic integrator for non-separable Hamiltonians
is derived for simulating paths across this manifold which provides highly
efficient convergence and exploration of the target density. The performance of
the Riemannian Manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method is assessed by
performing posterior inference on logistic regression models, log-Gaussian Cox
point processes, stochastic volatility models, and Bayesian estimation of
parameter posteriors of dynamical systems described by nonlinear differential
equations. Substantial improvements in the time normalised Effective Sample

twice that found in state-of-the-art dark matter simulations of the standard
Lambda-CDM cosmology. A central baryon enhancement that could explain this
discrepancy is not observed, leaving a major puzzle. We propose a solution
based on the merger histories of clusters. A significant fraction of the final
dark matter content of a cluster halo originates within galaxy-sized halos, in
which gas can cool and compress the dark matter core to high densities. The
subsequent tidal stripping of this compressed dark matter occurs in denser
regions that are closer to the center of the cluster halo. Eventually, the
originally cooled gas must be dispersed into the intracluster medium through
feedback, for consistency with observations that do not find central baryon
enhancements in clusters. Still, the early adiabatic compression of the
galactic dark matter leaves a net effect on the cluster. Using a simple model
for this process, we show that the central cluster profile is substantially
modified, potentially explaining the observed discrepancy.

describe the Inverse Scattering Transform (IST) for the Camassa-Holm hierarchy
as a Generalised Fourier Transform (GFT). Using GFT we describe explicitly some
members of the CH hierarchy, including integrable deformations for the CH
equation. Also we show that solutions of some 2+1-dimensional generalizations
of CH can be constructed via the IST for the CH hierarchy.

into the relationship between the different forms of nonlocality and the

replaced by various efficiently decodable quantum codes. Among all the

  The principal G-bundle E_G over M is given by a homomorphism \varpi(M,x_0)

  There are integers b > a > 0 such that the principal G-bundle (F^b_M)^*E_G is
isomorphic to (F^a_M)^*E_G, where F_M is the absolute Frobenius morphism of M.
  The principal G-bundle E_G is strongly semistable,

individual and personalized analysis of each star. During the survey phase of
Kepler, this will be impossible. This is the reason why, within the AsteroFLAG

power is present and, after fitting the background, it looks for the mode
amplitudes as well as the central frequency of the p-mode hump. A good
estimation of the large separation can thus be inferred in this region. If the

describe a few features of this pipeline and its application to AsteroFLAG

within the bounds of which a change of the classical paradigms in mathematical

the hypothesis that immediate values of all the physical quantities,
characterizing system's state, exist and can be accurately measured in
principle. Non-relativistic quantum mechanics does not reject the existence of
the immediate values of the classical physical quantities, nevertheless not
each of them can be simultaneously measured (the uncertainty principle).
Relativistic quantum mechanics rejects the existence of the immediate values of
any physical quantity in principle, and consequently the notion of the system
state, including the notion of the wave function, which becomes rigorously
nondefinable.
  The task of this work consists in econophysical analysis of the conceptual
fundamentals and mathematical apparatus of the classical physics, relativity
theory, non-relativistic and relativistic quantum mechanics, subject to the
historical, psychological and philosophical aspects and modern state of the
socio-economic modeling problem. We have shown that actually and, virtually, a
long time ago, new paradigms of modeling were accepted in the quantum theory,
within the bounds of which the notion of the physical quantity operator becomes
the primary fundamental conception, description of the system dynamics becomes
discrete and approximate in its essence, prediction of the future, even in the
rough, is actually impossible when setting aside the aftereffect i.e. the

duration ranging from 1 to 6 hours and hence were considered for intra-night
optical variability (INOV). In total we have 4888 datapoints which were
simultaneous in gR and I filters. Of the 22 nights considered for INOV, the
object showed flux variability on 19 nights with the amplitude of variability
in the I-band ranging from ~4% to ~55%. The duty cycle for INOV was thus found
to be 83%. No time lag between different bands was noticed on most of the
nights, except for 3 nights where the variation in g was found to lead that of
the I band by 0.3 to 1.5 hrs. On inter-night timescales, no lag was found
between g and I bands. On inter-night timescales as well as intra-night
timescales on most of the nights, the amplitude of variability was found to
increase toward shorter wavelengths. The flux variations in the different bands
were not achromatic, with the blazar tending to become bluer when brighter both
on inter-night and intra-night timescales; and this might be attributed to the
larger amplitude variation at shorter wavelengths. A clear periodic variation

Einstein's equation with a negative cosmological constant. We explain here,
from the field-theoretic viewpoint how the dynamics in this sector gets
determined by the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor \emph{alone}.
We first show that the Boltzmann equation has very special solutions which
could be \textit{functionally} completely determined in terms of the
energy-momentum tensor alone. We call these solutions \textit{conservative
solutions}. We indicate why conservative solutions should also exist when we
refine this kinetic description to go closer to the exact microscopic theory or
even move away from the regime of weak coupling so that no kinetic description
could be employed. We argue that these \textit{conservative solutions} form the
universal sector dual to pure gravity at strong coupling and large $N$. Based
on this observation, we propose a \textit{regularity condition} on the
energy-momentum tensor so that the dual solution in pure gravity has a smooth
future horizon. We also study if irreversibility emerges only at long time
scales of observation, unlike the case of the Boltzmann equation.

physical properties. We used a cross-correlation technique and other tools to
derive accurate radial/rotational velocities and to perform a spectral
classification for both single and SB2 stars. The spectral subtraction
technique was used to derive chromospheric activity levels and Li abundances.
We estimated the fraction of young single stars and multiple systems in stellar
soft X-ray surveys and the contamination by more evolved systems, like RS
CVn's. We classified stars on the basis of Li abundance and give a glimpse of
their sky distribution. The sample appears to be a mixture of young
Pleiades-/Hyades- like stars plus an older Li-poor population (~1-2 Gyr). 7
stars with Li abundance compatible with the age of IC 2602 (~30 Myr) or younger
were detected as well, although 2 appear to be Li-rich giants. The discovery of
a large number of Li-rich giants is another outcome of this survey. The
contamination of soft X-ray surveys by old systems in which the activity level
is enhanced by tidal synchronisation is not negligible, especially for K-type
stars. 5 stars with Li content close to the primordial abundance are probably
associated with known moving groups in the solar neighbourhood. Some of them
are PTTS candidates according to their positions in the HR diagram.

from a fact that zero-energy states in a particular valley are restricted to

significantly improved our previous analysis [1] of the 5-year WMAP $TT$ and
$TE$ data at lower multipoles $\ell$. This more general analysis returned
essentially the same maximum likelihood (ML) result (unfortunately, surrounded
by large remaining uncertainties): the relic gw are present and they are
responsible for approximately 20% of the temperature quadrupole. We identify
and discuss the reasons by which the contribution of gw can be overlooked in a
data analysis. One of the reasons is a misleading reliance on data from very
high multipoles $\ell$, another - a too narrow understanding of the problem as
the search for $B$-modes of polarization, rather than the detection of relic gw
with the help of all correlation functions. Our analysis of WMAP5 data has led
to the identification of a whole family of models characterized by relatively
high values of the likelihood function. Using the Fisher matrix formalism we
formulated forecasts for {\it Planck} mission in the context of this family of
models. We explore in details various `optimistic', `pessimistic' and `dream
case' scenarios. We show that in some circumstances the $B$-mode detection may
be very inconclusive, at the level of signal-to-noise ratio $S/N =1.75$,
whereas a smarter data analysis can reveal the same gw signal at $S/N= 6.48$.
The final result is encouraging. Even under unfavourable conditions in terms of
instrumental noises and foregrounds, the relic gw, if they are characterized by
the ML parameters that we found from WMAP5 data, will be detected by {\it
Planck} at the level $S/N = 3.65$.

function $Z_{S}$ is considered as the fundamental quantity, which is postulated
to be the ratio of the overall (system+bath) and the bath partition functions,
and the standard thermodynamic relation $E_{S}=-d(\ln Z_{S})/d\beta$ is used to
obtain the mean system energy. % ($\beta\equiv 1/(k_{B}T)$, $k_{B}$ is the
Boltzmann constant, %and $T$ is the temperature). Employing both classical and
quantum mechanical treatments, the advantages and shortcomings of the two
approaches are analyzed in detail for various different systems. It is shown
that already within classical mechanics both approaches predict significantly
different results for thermodynamic quantities provided the system-bath
interaction is not bilinear or the system of interest consists of more than a
single particle. Based on the results, it is concluded that the first approach
is superior.

in the structure of the CSM, for models with different WR life times, has a
strong impact on the resulting SNR. With an increasing WR life time the reverse
shock velocity of the SNR decreases and the range of observed velocities in the
shocked material increases. Furthermore, if a WR phase occurs, the remainders
of the WR shell will be visible in the resulting SNR. Comparing our results
with the observations suggests that the progenitor star of Cas A did not have a
WR phase. We also find that the quasi-stationary flocculi (QSF) in Cas A are
not consistent with the clumps from a WR shell that have been shocked and
accelerated by the interaction with the SN ejecta. We can also conclude that
for a SN explosion taking place in a CSM that is shaped by the wind during a
short < 15000 yr WR phase, the clumps from the WR shell will be visible inside
the SNR.

solar-like stars. Analysis of the light curves provides oscillation frequencies
that make it possible to probe the interior of the stars. However, additional
constraints on the fundamental parameters of the stars are important for the
theoretical modelling to be successful. We will estimate the fundamental
parameters (mass, radius and luminosity) of the first four solar-like targets
to be observed in the asteroseismic field. In addition, we will determine their
effective temperature, metallicity and detailed abundance pattern. To constrain
the stellar mass, radius and age we use the SHOTGUN software which compares the
location of the stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram with theoretical
evolution models. This method takes into account the uncertainties of the
observed parameters including the large separation determined from the
solar-like oscillations. We determine the effective temperatures and abundance
patterns in the stars from the analysis of high-resolution spectra. We have
determined the mass, radius and luminosity of the four CoRoT targets to within
5-10 percent, 2-4 percent and 5-13 percent, respectively. The quality of the
stellar spectra determines how well we can constrain the effective temperature.
For the two best spectra we get 1-sigma uncertainties below 60 K and for the
other two 100-150 K. The uncertainty on the surface gravity is less than 0.08
dex for three stars while for HD 181906 it is 0.15 dex. The reason for the
larger uncertainty is that the spectrum has two components with a luminosity
ratio of Lp/Ls = 0.50+-0.15. While Hipparcos astrometric data strongly suggest
it is a binary star we find evidence that the fainter star may be a background
star, since it is less luminous but hotter.

symmetry are regarded as a founding principles of nature. But, one may wonder,
can diffeomorphism gauge symmetry emerge as a low energy property of certain
topological/quantum order in a qbit model that has no diffeomorphism gauge
symmetry? In this paper, we showed that, at least, the linearized
diffeomorphism gauge symmetry h_{\mu\nu}\to h_{\mu\nu} +\prt_\mu f_\nu+\prt_\nu
f_\mu can indeed emerge from some qbit models (or quantum spin models).
Physically, the emergence of the (linearized) diffeomorphism gauge symmetry
implies the emergence of gapless helicity +/- 2 excitations (ie the gravitons).
  In the first qbit model (called the L-type model), we show that helicity +/-
2 gapless excitations appear as the only type of low energy excitations using a
reliable semiclassical approach. The dispersion of the gapless helicity +/- 2
is found to be \eps_k \propto k^3. The appearance of the gapless helicity +/- 2
modes suggests that the ground state of the qbit model is a new state of
matter. In the second model (called the N-type model) the collective modes are
strongly interacting and there is no reliable approach to understand its low
energy dynamics. Using a spin-wave/quantum-freeze approach (which is shown to
reproduce the correct emergent U(1) gauge theory in a quantum rotor model), we
argue that the second model may contain helicity +/- 2 gapless excitations as
the only type of low energy excitations with a linear dispersion \om \propto k.

half-flat SU(3)-structure on a compact six-manifold M defines an extension of M
to a seven-manifold with holonomy in G_2. We give a new proof, which does not
require the compactness of M. More generally, we prove that the evolution of
any half-flat G-structure on a six-manifold M defines an extension of M to a
Ricci-flat seven-manifold N, for any real form G of SL(3,C). If G is
noncompact, then the holonomy group of N is a subgroup of the noncompact form
G_2^* of G_2^C. Similar results are obtained for the extension of nearly
half-flat structures by nearly parallel G_2- or G_2^*-structures, as well as
for the extension of cocalibrated G_2- and G_2^*-structures by parallel
Spin(7)- and Spin(3,4)-structures, respectively. As an application, we obtain
that any six-dimensional homogeneous manifold with an invariant half-flat
structure admits a canonical extension to a seven-manifold with a parallel G_2-
or G_2^*-structure. For the group H_3 \times H_3, where H_3 is the
three-dimensional Heisenberg group, we describe all left-invariant half-flat
structures and develop a method to explicitly determine the resulting parallel
G_2- or G_2^*-structure without integrating. In particular, we construct three
eight-parameter families of metrics with holonomy equal to G_2 and G_2^*.
Moreover, we obtain a strong rigidity result for the metrics induced by a
half-flat structure (\omega,\rho) on H_3 \times H_3 satisfying \omega(Z,Z)=0
where Z denotes the centre. Finally, we describe the special geometry of the
space of stable three-forms satisfying a reality condition. Considering all

computing the distortion of the equipotential surfaces, we are able to evaluate
the impact of these perturbing forces on the stability of Roche-lobe overflow
(RLOF). Radiative forces are parametrized through the constant reduction factor
that they impose on the gravitational force from the radiating star (neglecting
any shielding in case of large optical thickness). Forces imparted by
pulsations are derived from the velocity profile of the wind that they trigger.
We provide analytical expressions to compute the generalized Roche radius.

surrounding this proposal were suggestions that the kagom\'e planes in the

the system to behave as a quasi-2-dimensional magnet. This was reasoned from
the near 95$^\circ$ angles made at the bridging oxygens that mediate exchange
between the Cu ions that link the kagom\'e planes.
  Recent work pointed out that this exchange model is inappropriate for
$\gamma$-Cu$_2$(OH)$_3$Cl, where the oxygen is present as a

powder diffraction to show that the low temperature magnetic structure ($T<6$
K) was canted and involved significant spin ordering on all the Cu$^{2+}$
spins, which is incompatible with the interpretation of simultaneous VBS and
N\'eel ordering. Correspondingly, clinoatacamite is best considered a distorted

arise from star formation events, the AGN contribution is non-negligible (23
