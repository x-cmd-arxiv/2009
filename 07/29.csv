laboratories. With luminosities as low as 10^-7 L_MW, they inhabit the lowest
mass dark matter halos known to host stars and are presently the most direct
tracers of the distribution, mass spectrum, and clustering scale of dark
matter. Their resolved stellar populations also facilitate detailed studies of
their history and mass content. To fully exploit this potential requires a
well-defined census of virtually invisible galaxies to the faintest possible
limits and to the largest possible distances. I review the past and present
impacts of survey astronomy on the census of Milky Way dwarf galaxy companions,
and discuss the future of finding ultra-faint dwarf galaxies around the Milky

simultaneously over the cosmological constant, the primordial density contrast,
and spatial curvature. We consider two different measures for regulating the
divergences of eternal inflation, and three different models for observers. In
one model, observers are assumed to arise in proportion to the entropy produced
by stars; in the others, they arise at a fixed time (5 or 10 billion years)
after star formation. The star formation rate, which underlies all our observer
models, depends sensitively on the three scanning parameters. We employ a
recently developed model of star formation in the multiverse, a considerable
refinement over previous treatments of the astrophysical and cosmological
properties of different pocket universes. For each combination of observer
model and measure, we display all single and bivariate probability
distributions, both with the remaining parameter(s) held fixed, and
marginalized. Our results depend only weakly on the observer model but more
strongly on the measure. Using the causal diamond measure, the observed
parameter values (or bounds) lie within the central $2\sigma$ of nearly all
probability distributions we compute, and always within $3\sigma$. This success
is encouraging and rather nontrivial, considering the large size and dimension
of the parameter space. The causal patch measure gives similar results as long
as curvature is negligible. If curvature dominates, the causal patch leads to a
novel runaway: it prefers a negative value of the cosmological constant, with
the smallest magnitude available in the landscape.

them. As BPs are seen in projection against the disk their true emission
heights are unknown. The correlation of the BP locations on the Fe XII radiance
map from EIT with the magnetic field features (in particular neutral lines) was
investigated in detail. The coronal magnetic field was determined by an
extrapolation of the photospheric field to different altitudes above the disk.
It was found that most BPs sit on or near a photospheric neutral line, but that
the emission occurs at a height of about 5 Mm. Some BPs, while being seen in
projection, still seem to coincide with neutral lines, although their emission
takes place at heights of more than 10 Mm. Such coincidences almost disappear
for emissions above 20 Mm. We also projected the upper segments of the 3-D
magnetic field lines above different heights, respectively, on to the x-y
plane. The shape of each BP was compared with the respective field-line segment
nearby. This comparison suggests that most coronal BPs are actually located on
the top of their associated magnetic loops. Finally, we calculated for each
selected BP region the correlation coefficient between the Fe XII intensity
enhancement and the horizontal component of the extrapolated magnetic field
vector at the same x-y position in planes of different heights, respectively.
We found that for almost all the BP regions we studied the correlation
coefficient, with increasing height, increases to a maximal value and then
decreases again. The height corresponding to this maximum was defined as the
correlation height, which for most bright points was found to range below 20
Mm.

dependence on the information transmission delay and coupling strength over
scale-free neuronal networks with different average degrees and scaling
exponents. As the underlying model of neuronal dynamics, we use the efficient
Rulkov map with additive noise. We show that increasing the coupling strength
enhances synchronization monotonously, whereas delay plays a more subtle role.
In particular, we found that depending on the inherent oscillation frequency of
individual neurons, regions of irregular and regular propagating excitatory
fronts appear intermittently as the delay increases. These delay-induced
synchronization transitions manifest as well-expressed minima in the measure
for spatial synchrony, appearing at every multiple of the oscillation
frequency. Larger coupling strengths or average degrees can broaden the region
of regular propagating fronts by a given information transmission delay and
further improve synchronization. These results are robust against variations in
system size, intensity of additive noise and the scaling exponent of the
underlying scale-free topology. We argue that fine-tuned information
transmission delays are vital for assuring optimally synchronized excitatory
fronts on complex neuronal networks, and indeed, they should be seen as
important as the coupling strength or the overall density of interneuronal
connections. We finally discuss some biological implications of the presented
results.

developed to understand the nature of consciousness and the totality of
experience. The three states of consciousness are taken to form the triplet of
eigenstates of a spin-one entity and are derived as the triplet resulting from
the composition of two spins by treating the subject and the object as
interacting two-state, spin-half systems with external and internal
projections. The state of deep sleep is analysed in the light of this
phenomenological approach and a novel understanding of the status of the
individual consciousness in this state is obtained. The resulting fourth state
i.e. the singlet state is interpreted to correspond to the superconscious state
of intuitive experience and is justified by invoking the concept of the
universal consciousness as the underlying source of all individual states of
experience. It is proposed that the individual experiences result from the
operations of four individualizing observables which project out the individual
from the universal. The one-to-one correspondence between the individual and
the universal states of experience is brought out and their identity in the
fourth state is established by showing that all individualizing quantum numbers
become zero in this state leaving no trace of any individuality.

employs a CCD camera, placed at the focal point of the reflector, which
acquires a series of images of the reflector while the telescope performs a
raster scan about a star. Well-aligned facets appear bright when the telescope
points directly at the star while misaligned facets appear bright when the
angle between the telescope pointing direction and the star is twice the
misalignment angle of the mirror. Data from these scans can therefore be used
to produce a set of corrections which can be applied to the facets. In this
contribution we report on initial experience with an alignment system based on
this principle.

It shows weak but broad H-alpha emission; polarimetric variability; PAH and H2

is little or no excess mid-infrared emission within 100 AU of the star; the
excess emission is extended over several arcseconds, is quite asymmetric, and
is bright in the UV-excited 11.3 micron PAH emission feature. A new

X-ray emission is very hard and dominated by continuum emission; it is well-fit
by a multi-temperature thermal model and shows no evidence of unusually high
densities. We argue that the far-ultraviolet emission from the star's
transition region is sufficient to excite the observed extended PAH and
continuum emission, and that the H2 emission may be similarly extended and
excited. This extended emission may be more akin to a small-scale
photodissociation region than a protoplanetary disk, highlighting both the very

hydrodynamical cosmological simulations, by including two physical processes
important for LAEs: (a) Lyman Alpha and continuum luminosities produced by
cooling of collisionally excited HI in the galaxy, (b) dust formation and
evolution; we follow these processes on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis. HI cooling on
average contributes 16-18% of the Lyman Alpha radiation produced by stars, but
this value can be much higher in low mass LAEs and further increased if the HI
is clumpy. The continuum luminosity is instead almost completely dominated by
stellar sources. The dust content of galaxies scales with their stellar mass,
M_{dust} is proportional to M_*^0.7 and stellar metallicity, Z_*, such that
M_{dust} is proportional to Z_*^1.7. As a result, the massive galaxies have
Lyman Alpha escape fraction as low as f_alpha=0.1, with a LAE-averaged value
decreasing with redshift such that it is (0.33,0.23) at z =(5.7,6.6). The UV
continuum escape fraction shows the opposite trend with redshift, possibly
resulting from clumpiness evolution. The model successfully reproduces the
observed Lyman Alpha and UV luminosity functions at different redshifts and the
Lyman Alpha equivalent width scatter to a large degree, although the observed
distribution appears to be more more extended than the predicted one. We
discuss possible reasons for such tension.

apparent mechanism that would prevent formation or detection of Be stars with
black holes. This disparity is referred to as a missing Be -- black hole X-ray
binary problem. We point out that current evolutionary scenarios that lead to
the formation of Be X-ray binaries predict that the ratio of these binaries
with neutron stars to the ones with black holes is rather high F_NStoBH=10-50,
with the more likely formation models providing the values at the high end. The
ratio is a natural outcome of (i) the stellar initial mass function that
produces more neutron stars than black holes and (ii) common envelope evolution
(i.e. a major mechanism involved in the formation of interacting binaries) that
naturally selects progenitors of Be X-ray binaries with neutron stars (binaries
with comparable mass components have more likely survival probabilities) over
ones with black holes (which are much more likely to be common envelope
mergers). A comparison of this ratio (i.e. F_NStoBH=30) with the number of

over 7 years with excellent synoptic coverage which will enable the discovery

representative light curves of different variables we found so far in two

a relay node transmits a jamming signal to create interference at the

determining the antenna weights and transmit power of source and relay, so that
the system secrecy rate is maximized subject to a total transmit power
constraint, or, the transmit power is minimized subject to a secrecy rate
constraint. Since the optimal solutions to these problems are difficult to
obtain, suboptimal closed-form solutions are proposed that introduce an

via Noether embedment of the linearized Weyl symmetry. In fact, each self-dual

a mixing term with no particle content which assures spectrum equivalence of
$\cL {SD}^{(4)}$ to other lower-order self-dual models despite its pure higher

degrees of freedom of $\cL {SD}^{(4)}$ are encoded in a rank-two tensor which

perturbed by a companion object can drive orbital evolution of the system to a
so-called tidal fixed point, in which the apsidal lines of the transiting
planet and its perturber are aligned, and for which variations in the orbital
eccentricities of both planet and perturber are damped out. Significant
contributions to the apsidal precession rate are made by the secular
planet-planet interaction, by general relativity, and by the gravitational
quadropole fields created by the transiting planet's tidal and rotational
distortions. The fixed-point orbital eccentricity of the inner planet is
therefore a strong function of the planet's interior structure. We illustrate
these ideas in the specific context of the recently discovered HAT-P-13
exo-planetary system, and show that one can already glean important insights
into the physical properties of the inner transiting planet. We present
structural models of the planet, which indicate that its observed radius can be
maintained for a one-parameter sequence of models that properly vary core mass
and tidal energy dissipation in the interior. We use an octopole-order secular
theory of the orbital dynamics to derive the dependence of the inner planet's
eccentricity, on its tidal Love number. We find that the currently measured
eccentricity, implies 0.116 < k2_{b} < 0.425, 0 M_{Earth}<M_{core}<120
M_{Earth}$, and Q_{b} < 300,000. Improved measurement of the eccentricity will
soon allow for far tighter limits to be placed on all three of these

of cell phenomena, including stability of protein structures or their
fragments, allosteric transitions and energy transfer. The study presents a
statistical-thermodynamic analysis of relationship between the sequence
composition and the distribution of residue fluctuations in protein-protein
complexes. A one-node-per residue elastic network model accounting for the
nonhomogeneous protein mass distribution and the inter-atomic interactions
through the renormalized inter-residue potential is developed. Two factors, a
protein mass distribution and a residue environment, were found to determine
the scale of residue fluctuations. Surface residues undergo larger fluctuations
than core residues, showing agreement with experimental observations. Ranking
residues over the normalized scale of fluctuations yields a distinct
classification of amino acids into three groups. The structural instability in
proteins possibly relates to the high content of the highly fluctuating
residues and a deficiency of the weakly fluctuating residues in irregular
secondary structure elements (loops), chameleon sequences and disordered
proteins. Strong correlation between residue fluctuations and the sequence
composition of protein loops supports this hypothesis. Comparing fluctuations
of binding site residues (interface residues) with other surface residues shows
that, on average, the interface is more rigid than the rest of the protein
surface and Gly, Ala, Ser, Cys, Leu and Trp have a propensity to form more
stable docking patches on the interface. The findings have broad implications
for understanding mechanisms of protein association and stability of protein

research due to both its fundamental properties as well as its potential

electronic properties of nanoscopic systems, the lack of control can lead to
seemingly deleterious effects arising from the random arrangement of such

theory and non-equilibrium Green's functions calculations, that it is possible
to obtain perfect spin selectivity in doped graphene nanoribbons to produce a
perfect spin filter. We show that initially unpolarized electrons entering the
system give rise to 100% polarization of the current due to random disorder.
This effect is explained in terms of different localization lengths for each
spin channel which together with the well know exponential dependence of the
conductance on the length of the device leads to a new mechanism for the spin
filtering effect that is enhanced by disorder.

strongly coupled N=2* plasma using the AdS/CFT correspondence. Both increase in
units of the spatial string tension as the theory departs from conformal
invariance. The description of heavy quark dynamics using a Langevin equation
is also considered. It is found that the difference between the velocity
dependent factors of the transverse and longitudinal momentum broadening of the
quark admit an interpretation in terms of relativistic effects, so the
distribution is spherical in the quark rest frame. When conformal invariance is
broken there is a broadening of the longitudinal momentum distribution. This
effect may be useful in understanding the jet distribution observed in
experiments.

partial restoration of chiral symmetry. This modification may be accessed
directly by measuring low-momentum LVM's via their decays into lepton pairs
inside the hot matter. Since leptons are not subject to the strong interaction,
they do not rescatter on their way out of the medium. The PHENIX experiment at
RHIC has measured LVM production at mid-rapidity in $p$ + $p$, $d$+Au and Au+Au
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 200 GeV\@. Mass peaks for the LVM's have

may be affected in the medium, the branching ratios of various decay modes may
also be modified from the values in vacuum. The relative branching ratio is
compared between $\phi\to e^+e^-$ and $\phi\to K^+K^-$, which may be sensitive

term, inter-valley scattering, and the Rashba spin-orbit interaction. The known
tendency of graphene to anti-localize in the absence of inter-valley scattering
between K and K' points is naturally placed as the massless limit of Kane-Mele

vertical magnetic field. When the imposed magnetic field is weak, the dynamics
are dominated by a shear flow (Kelvin-Helmholtz type) instability. For stronger
fields, a magnetic buoyancy instability is preferred. If this stably stratified
shear layer lies below a convectively unstable region, these two regions can
interact. Once again, when the imposed field is very weak, the dynamical
effects of the magnetic field are negligible and the interactions between the
shear layer and the convective layer are relatively minor. However, if the
magnetic field is strong enough to favour magnetic buoyancy instabilities in
the shear layer, extended magnetic flux concentrations form and rise into the
convective layer. These magnetic structures have a highly disruptive effect
upon the convective motions in the upper layer.

apart from inner and outer boundary layers, can be reproduced with great accu-
racy if the isorotation contours correspond to characteristics of the thermal
wind equation. This requires that there be a formal quantitative relationship
involving the entropy and the angular velocity. Earlier work has suggested that
this could arise from magnetohydrodynamic stability constraints; here we argue
that purely hydrodynamical processes could also lead to such a result. Of
special importance to the hydrodynamical solution is the fact that the thermal
wind equation is insensitive to radial entropy gradients. This allows a much
more general class of solutions to fit the solar isorotation contours, beyond
just those in which the entropy itself must be a function of the angular
velocity. In particular, for this expanded class, the thermal wind solution of
the solar rotation profile remains valid even when large radial entropy
gradients are present. A clear and explicit example of this class of solution
appears to be present in published numerical simulations of the solar
convective zone. Though hydrodynamical in character, the theory is not
sensitive to the presence of weak magnetic fields. Thus, the identification of
solar isorotation contours with the characteristics of the thermal wind
equation appears to be robust, accommodating, but by no means requiring,
magnetic field dynamics.

the interface between the two solvents. A discrete model of such system, based

actions on graphs and posets. We view $\Hom(T,-)$ and $\Hom(-,G)$ as functors
from graphs to posets, and introduce a functor $(-)^1$ from posets to graphs
obtained by taking atoms as vertices. Our main structural results establish
useful interpretations of the equivariant homotopy type of $\Hom$ complexes in
terms of spaces of equivariant poset maps and $\Gamma$-twisted products of
spaces. When $P = F(X)$ is the face poset of a simplicial complex $X$, this
provides a useful way to control the topology of $\Hom$ complexes.
  Our foremost application of these results is the construction of new families
of `test graphs' with arbitrarily large chromatic number - graphs $T$ with the
property that the connectivity of $\Hom(T,G)$ provides the best possible lower
bound on the chromatic number of $G$. In particular we focus on two infinite
families, which we view as higher dimensional analogues of odd cycles. The
family of `spherical graphs' have connections to the notion of homomorphism
duality, whereas the family of `twisted toroidal graphs' lead us to establish a
weakened version of a conjecture (due to Lov\'{a}sz) relating topological lower
bounds on chromatic number to maximum degree. Other structural results allow us
to show that any finite simplicial complex $X$ with a free action by the
symmetric group $S_n$ can be approximated up to $S_n$-homotopy equivalence as
$\Hom(K_n,G)$ for some graph $G$; this is a generalization of a result of
Csorba. We conclude the paper with some discussion regarding the underlying

16760 from the N2K sample. Precise Doppler measurements of the star from Subaru
and Keck revealed a Keplerian velocity variation with a period of 466.47+-0.35
d, a semiamplitude of 407.71+-0.84 m/s, and an eccentricity of 0.084+-0.003.
Adopting a stellar mass of 0.78+-0.05 M_Sun, we obtain a minimum mass for the
companion of 13.13+-0.56 M_JUP, which is close to the planet/brown-dwarf
transition, and the semimajor axis of 1.084+-0.023 AU. The nearly circular
orbit despite the large mass and intermediate orbital period makes this
companion unique among known substellar companions.

identified by Simon et al. (2006) located within the SCUBA Legacy Catalogue.

1.7x10^22 cm-2) compared to those cores not detected at 850um (a mean of
1.0x10^22 cm-2). Combined with sensitivity estimates, we suggest that the cores
not detected at 850um are low mass, low column density and low temperature
cores that are below the sensitivity limit of SCUBA at 850um. For a subsample
of the cores detected at 850um those contained within the MIPSGAL area) we find
that two thirds are associated with 24um sources. Cores not associated with
24um emission are either ``starless'' IRDC cores that perhaps have yet to form
stars, or contain low mass YSOs below the MIPSGAL detection limit. We see that
those ``starless'' IRDC cores and the IRDC cores associated with 24um emission
are drawn from the same column density population and are of similar mass. If
we then assume the cores without 24um embedded sources are at an earlier
evolutionary stage to cores with embedded objects we derive a statistical
lifetime for the quiescent phase of a few 10^3-10^4 years. Finally, we make
conservative predictions for the number of observed IRDCs that will be observed

excitation at 2 eV, there are opposite changes observed at higher energy at 4 -
5 eV, appearing on a broad-band background due to the strongly dipole-allowed O
2p -- Mn 3d transition around the charge-transfer energy 4.7 eV. Based on the
observation of a pronounced spectral-weight transfer between low- and
high-energy features upon magnetic ordering, they are assigned to high-spin and
low-spin intersite d^4d^4 - d^3d^5 transitions by Mn electrons. The anisotropy
of the lowest-energy optical band and the spectral weight shifts induced by
antiferromagnetic spin correlations are quantitatively described by an
effective spin-orbital superexchange model. An analysis of the multiplet
structure of the intersite transitions by Mn e_g electrons allowed us to
estimate the effective intra-atomic Coulomb interaction, the Hund exchange
coupling, and the Jahn-Teller splitting energy between e_g orbitals in LaMnO_3.

from the $VI$ photometry of stars in the $42' \times 28'$ field using the SMART
model developed by Yuk & Lee (2007, ApJ, 668, 876) and adopting a closed-box
model for chemical evolution. For the adopted age of Sextans 15 Gyr, we find
that $>$84% of the stars formed prior to 11 Gyr ago, significant star formation
extends from 15 to 11 Gyr ago ($\sim$ 65% of the stars formed 13 to 15 Gyr ago
while $\sim$ 25% formed 11 to 13 Gyr ago), detectable star formation continued
to at least 8 Gyr ago, the star formation history is more extended in the
central regions than the outskirts, and the difference in star formation rates
between the central and outer regions is most marked 11 to 13 Gyr ago. Whether
blue straggler stars are interpreted as intermediate age main sequence stars
affects conclusions regarding the star formation history for times 4 to 8 Gyr
ago, but this is at most only a trace population. We find that the metallicity
of the stars increased rapidly up to [Fe/H]=--1.6 in the central region and to
[Fe/H]=--1.8 in the outer region within the first Gyr, and has varied slowly
since then. The abundance ratios of several elements derived in this study are
in good agreement with the observational data based on the high resolution
spectroscopy in the literature. We conclude that the primary driver for the
radial gradient of the stellar population in this galaxy is the star formation
history, which self-consistently drives the chemical enrichment history.

objects is discussed. As a case study, a regular black Saturn system where the
central black hole has vanishing intrinsic angular momentum, J^{BH}=0, is
considered. It is shown that there is a correlation between the sign of two
response functions. One is interpreted as a moment of inertia of the black ring
in the black Saturn system. The other measures the variation of the black ring
horizon angular velocity with the central black hole mass, for fixed ring mass
and angular momentum. The two different phases defined by these response
functions collapse, for small central black hole mass, to the thin and fat ring
phases. In the fat phase, the zero area limit of the black Saturn ring has
reduced spin j^2>1, which is related to the behaviour of the ring angular
velocity. Using the `gravitomagnetic clock effect', for which a universality
property is exhibited, it is shown that frame dragging measured by an
asymptotic observer decreases, in both phases, when the central black hole mass
increases, for fixed ring mass and angular momentum. A close parallelism
between the results for the fat phase and those obtained recently for the
double Kerr solution is drawn, considering also a regular black Saturn system

gas (e.g., Halpha, [NII]) emissions coincide, unlike what is observed in local,
strongly interacting ULIRGs. The only exceptions are galaxies with
circumnuclear rings of star formation where the most luminous Halpha emitting
regions are found in the rings rather than in the nuclei, and the displacements
are well understood in terms of differences in the stellar populations. A large
fraction of the nuclei of these LIRGs are classified as LINER and intermediate
LINER/HII, or composite objects. The excitation conditions of the integrated
emission depend on the relative contributions of HII regions and the diffuse
emission to the line emission over the PMAS FoV. Galaxies dominated by high
surface-brightness HII regions show integrated HII-like excitation. A few
galaxies show slightly larger integrated [NII]/Halpha and [SII]/Halpha line
ratios than the nuclear ones, probably because of more contribution from the
diffuse emission. The Halpha velocity fields over the central few kpc are
generally consistent, at least to first order, with rotational motions. The
velocity fields of most LIRGs are similar to those of disk galaxies, in
contrast to the highly perturbed fields of most local, strongly interacting
ULIRGs. The peak of the Halpha velocity dispersion coincides with the position
of the nucleus and is likely to be tracing mass. All these results are similar
to the properties of z~1 LIRGs, and they highlight the importance of detailed
studies of flux-limited samples of local LIRGs. (Abridged)

spectropolarimetric monitoring of the Herbig Ae star V380 Ori, in which we
discovered a magnetic field in 2005. A careful study of the intensity spectrum
reveals the presence of a cool spectroscopic companion. By modelling the binary
spectrum we infer the effective temperature of both stars: $10500\pm 500$ K for
the primary, and $5500\pm500$ K for the secondary, and we argue that the high
metallicity ($[M/H] = 0.5$), required to fit the lines may imply that the
primary is a chemically peculiar star. We observe that the radial velocity of
the secondary's lines varies with time, while that of the the primary does not.
By fitting these variations we derive the orbital parameters of the system. We
find an orbital period of $104\pm5$ d, and a mass ratio ($M_{\rm P}/M_{\rm S}$)
larger than 2.9. The intensity spectrum is heavily contaminated with strong,
broad and variable emission. A simple analysis of these lines reveals that a
disk might surround the binary, and that a wind occurs in the environment of
the system. Finally, we performed a magnetic analysis using the Least-Squares
Deconvolved (LSD) profiles of the Stokes $V$ spectra of both stars, and
adopting the oblique rotator model. From rotational modulation of the primary's
Stokes $V$ signatures, we infer its rotation period $P=4.31276\pm0.00042$ d,
and find that it hosts a centred dipole magnetic field of polar strength
$2.12\pm0.15$ kG, with a magnetic obliquity $\beta = 66\pm5^{\circ}$, and a
rotation axis inclination $i=32\pm5^{\circ}$. However, no magnetic field is
detected in the secondary, and if it hosts a dipolar magnetic field, its
strength must be below about 500 G, to be consistent with our observations.

the Cayley graph. For horocyclic elements the peak normal form and the
length-lexicographical normal form coincide. The main result of this paper is
that we can compute the peak normal form in polynomial time if $p$ divides $q$.
As consequence we can compute geodesic lengths in this case. In particular,
this gives a partial answer to Question 1 in Elder et al. 2009,

double splits is observed for a few points surrounding the equipartition one.
In normal hierarchy, collective effects turn out to be unobservable at all grid
points but one, where single splits occur. Admissible deviations from
equipartition may thus induce dramatic changes in the shape of supernova
(anti)neutrino spectra. The observed patterns are interpreted in terms of
initial flavor polarization vectors (defining boundaries for the single/double

systems based on multiset rewriting to models of Petri nets and the computation
power of these nets to their topology. In turn, the computational power of
these abstract computing devices can be understood by just looking at their
topology, that is, information flow.
  Here we continue this line of research introducing J languages and proving
that they can be accepted by place/transition systems whose underlying net is
composed only of joins. Moreover, we investigate how J languages relate to
other families of formal languages. In particular, we show that every J
language can be accepted by a log n space-bounded non-deterministic Turing
machine with a one-way read-only input. We also show that every J language has
a semilinear Parikh map and that J languages and context-free languages (CFLs)

interactions of (low-energy) fermionic stringy matter excitations with the

state by the defect, and subsequent re-emission. Quantum fluctuations of the
D-particles induce a non-trivial space-time background; in some circumstances
this could be akin to a cosmological Friedman-Robertson Walker
expanding-Universe, with weak (but non-zero) particle production. Furthermore
the D-particle medium can induce an MSW type effect. We have argued previously,
in the context of bosons, that the so-called flavour vacuum is the appropriate
state to be used, at least for low-energy excitations, with energies/momenta up
to a dynamically determined cutoff scale. In this work we evaluate the
flavour-vacuum expectation value (condensate) of the stress-energy tensor of
the (1/2)-spin fields with mixing in an effective low-energy Quantum Field
Theory in this foam-induced curved space-time. We demonstrate, at late epochs
of the Universe, that the fermionic vacuum condensate behaves as a fluid with
negative pressure and positive energy, but alone it cannot lead to present-day
accelerating Universes. One needs flavoured boson contributions for this

interacting particles evolving in a one-dimensional spatially periodic
washboard potential. A weak tilt of the washboard potential is applied biasing
one direction for particle transport. However, the tilt vanishes asymptotically
in the direction of bias. Moreover, the total energy content is not enough for
both particles to be able to escape simultaneously from an initial potential
well; to achieve transport the coupled particles need to interact
cooperatively. For low coupling strength the two particles remain trapped
inside the starting potential well permanently. For increased coupling strength
there exists a regime in which one of the particles transfers the majority of
its energy to the other one, as a consequence of which the latter escapes from
the potential well and the bond between them breaks. Finally, for suitably
large couplings, coordinated energy exchange between the particles allows them
to achieve escapes -- one particle followed by the other -- from consecutive
potential wells resulting in directed collective motion. The key mechanism of
transport rectification is based on the asymptotically vanishing tilt causing a
symmetry breaking of the non-chaotic fraction of the dynamics in the mixed
phase space. That is, after a chaotic transient, only at one of the boundaries
of the chaotic layer do resonance islands appear. The settling of trajectories
in the ballistic channels associated with transporting islands provides
long-range directed transport dynamics of the escaping dimer.

  The outcome of this work is that while 2HDM Type II can fit individual
observable through fine-tuning schemes, in a combined analysis it does not
perform better than the SM by favouring a decoupling solution. Assuming that
2HDM Type II is realized in Nature, constraints on its parameters ($m_{H^+}$

They derive explicit expressions for the leading order asymptotics for

Unfortunately, this approach misses an interesting observation that the actual

still not well understood. We analyze this problem considering a 2D Heisenberg
model with ferromagnetic exchange interactions, dipolar interactions and
perpendicular anisotropy, relevant e.g. in Fe/Cu(001) films. By extending a
classic result of Yafet & Gyorgy (YG) and using Monte Carlo simulations we
calculate the complete zero temperature phase diagram of the model. Through
this calculation we analyze the correlation between domain walls structure and
stripe width variation, as the perpendicular anisotropy changes. In particular,
we found evidences that the recently detected canted state becomes the ground
state of the system close to the Spin Reorientation Transition (SRT) for any
value of the exchange to dipolar couplings ratio. Far away of the SRT the
canted ground state is replaced by a saturated stripes state, in which
in--plane magnetization components are only present inside the walls. We find
that the domain wall structure strongly depends on the perpendicular
anisotropy: close to SRT it is well described by YG approximation, but a strong
departure is observed in the large anisotropy limit. Moreover, we show that
stripe width variation is directly related to domain wall width variation with
the anisotropy.

described roughly the mechanism underlying the formation of high-speed jets
ejected after the impact of an axisymmetric solid on a liquid-air interface. In
this work we combine detailed boundary-integral simulations with analytical
modeling to describe the formation and break-up of such Worthington jets in two
common physical systems: the impact of a circular disc on a liquid surface and
the release of air bubbles from an underwater nozzle. We first show that the
jet base dynamics can be predicted for both systems using our earlier model in
Gekle, Gordillo, van der Meer and Lohse. Phys. Rev. Lett. 102 (2009).
Nevertheless, our main point here is to present a model which allows us to
accurately predict the shape of the entire jet. Good agreement with numerics
and some experimental data is found. Moreover, we find that, contrarily to the
capillary breakup of liquid cylinders in vacuum studied by Rayleigh, the
breakup of stretched liquid jets at high values of both Weber and Reynolds
numbers is not triggered by the growth of perturbations coming from an external
source of noise. Instead, the jet breaks up due to the capillary deceleration
of the liquid at the tip which produces a corrugation to the jet shape. This
perturbation, which is self-induced by the flow, will grow in time promoted by
a capillary mechanism. We are able to predict the exact shape evolution of
Worthington jets ejected after the impact of a solid object - including the
size of small droplets ejected from the tip due to a surface-tension driven
instability - using as the single input parameters the minimum radius of the
cavity and the flow field before the jet emerges.
