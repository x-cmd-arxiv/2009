structure formation deposit energy in the primordial intergalactic medium,
producing reionization and heating. We investigate the constraints that are
imposed by the observed optical depth of the Universe and the measured
temperature of the intergalactic gas. We find that the bounds are significant,
and have the power to rule out large portions of the `DM mass/cross section'
parameter space. The optical depth bound is generally stronger and does not
depend significantly on the history of structure formation. The temperature
bound can be competitive in some cases for small masses or the hadronic
annihilation channels (and is affected somewhat by the details of structure
formation). We find in particular that DM particles with a large annihilation
cross section into leptons and a few TeV mass, such as those needed to explain
the PAMELA and FERMI+HESS cosmic ray excesses in terms of Dark Matter, are
ruled out as they produce too many free electrons. We also find that low mass
particles (<~ 10 GeV) tend to heat too much the gas and are therefore
disfavored.

bodies produces changes in its mass, angular momentum, and surface area.
Similarly, tidal forces acting on a Newtonian, viscous body do work on the
body, change its angular momentum, and part of the transferred gravitational
energy is dissipated into heat. The equations that describe the rate of change
of the black-hole mass, angular momentum, and surface area as a result of the
tidal interaction are compared with the equations that describe how the tidal
forces do work, torque, and produce heat in the Newtonian body. The equations
are strikingly similar, and unexpectedly, the correspondence between the
Newtonian-body and black-hole results is revealed to hold in near-quantitative
detail. The correspondence involves the combination k_2 \tau of ``Love
quantities'' that incorporate the details of the body's internal structure; k_2
is the tidal Love number, and \tau is the viscosity-produced delay between the
action of the tidal forces and the body's reaction. The combination k_2 \tau is
of order GM/c^3 for a black hole of mass M; it does not vanish, in spite of the
fact that k_2 is known to vanish individually for a nonrotating black hole.

that isothermal shocks can form even when the level of viscous dissipation is
relatively high. In order to better understand this phenomenon, we explore all
possible combinations of the fundamental flow parameters, such as specific
energy, specific angular momentum, and viscosity, to obtain the complete family
of global solutions. This procedure allows us to identify the region of the
parameter space where isothermal shocks can exist in viscous ADAF disks. The
allowed region is maximized in the inviscid case, and it shrinks as the level
of viscous dissipation increases. Adopting the canonical value gamma=1.5 for
the ratio of specific heats, we find that the shock region disappears
completely when the Shakura-Sunyaev viscosity parameter alpha exceeds the
critical value ~0.27. This establishes for the first time that steady ADAF
disks containing shocks can exist even for relatively high levels of viscous
dissipation. If an isothermal shock is present in the disk, it would have
important implications for the acceleration of energetic particles that can
escape to power the relativistic jets commonly observed around underfed,
radio-loud black holes. In two specific applications, we confirm that the
kinetic luminosity lost from the disk at the isothermal shock location is
sufficient to power the observed relativistic outflows in M87 and Sgr A*.

conductivity of a heavy fermion system close to a Kondo breakdown quantum
critical point, where the lattice Kondo temperature vanishes. As the system
approaches the phase transition from the heavy Fermi liquid side, we find a new
cross-over regime where the peak position is related to, but is not directly
proportional to, the lattice Kondo scale. In particular, the position of the
peak moves to lower energies, but remains finite at the critical point. On the
other hand, the peak value changes non-monotonically and eventually the peak
disappears at the quantum critical point, indicating the decoupling of the
narrow band of f-electrons from the conduction band. We argue that these are
unique signatures of a Kondo breakdown transition, and therefore can be useful
to distinguish it experimentally from a spin density wave instability.

We have carried out N-body simulations of the motion of a MBH = 3.7x10^6 Msun
MBH remnant in the Via Lactea I simulation, a Milky Way sized dark matter halo.
The black hole receives a recoil velocity of Vkick = 80, 120, 200, 300, and 400
km/s at redshift 1.5, and its orbit is followed for over 1 Gyr within a live
host halo, subject only to gravity and dynamical friction against the dark
matter background. We show that, owing to asphericities in the dark matter
potential, the orbit of the MBH is hightly non-radial, resulting in a
significantly increased decay timescale compared to a spherical halo. The
simulations are used to construct a semi-analytic model of the motion of the
MBH in a time-varying triaxial Navarro-Frenk-White dark matter halo plus a
spherical stellar bulge, where the dynamical friction force is calculated
directly from the velocity dispersion tensor. Such a model should offer a
realistic picture of the dynamics of kicked MBHs in situations where gas drag,
friction by disk stars, and the flattening of the central cusp by the returning
black hole are all negligible effects. We find that MBHs ejected with initial
recoil velocities Vkick > 500 km/s do not return to the host center within
Hubble time. In a Milky Way-sized galaxy, a recoiling hole carrying a gaseous
disk of initial mass ~MBH may shine as a quasar for a substantial fraction of
its wandering phase. The long decay timescales of kicked MBHs predicted by this
study may thus be favorable to the detection of off-nuclear quasar activity.

systems, can be modeled as directed networks, with links representing directed
interaction between two nodes. To assess the importance of a node in a directed
network, various centrality measures based on different criteria have been
proposed. However, calculating the centrality of a node is often difficult
because of the overwhelming size of the network or the incomplete information
about the network. Thus, developing an approximation method for estimating
centrality measures is needed. In this study, we focus on modular networks;
many real-world networks are composed of modules, where connection is dense
within a module and sparse across different modules. We show that ranking-type
centrality measures including the PageRank can be efficiently estimated once
the modular structure of a network is extracted. We develop an analytical
method to evaluate the centrality of nodes by combining the local property
(i.e., indegree and outdegree of nodes) and the global property (i.e.,
centrality of modules). The proposed method is corroborated with real data. Our
results provide a linkage between the ranking-type centrality values of modules
and those of individual nodes. They also reveal the hierarchical structure of
networks in the sense of subordination (not nestedness) laid out by
connectivity among modules of different relative importance. The present study
raises a novel motive of identifying modules in networks.

link represents, for example, the control of one node over the other node or
unidirectional information flows. Some centrality measures are used to
determine the relative importance of nodes specifically in directed networks.
We analyze such a centrality measure called the influence. The influence
represents the importance of nodes in various dynamics such as synchronization,
evolutionary dynamics, random walk, and social dynamics. We analytically
calculate the influence in various networks, including directed multipartite
networks and a directed version of the Watts-Strogatz small-world network. The
global properties of networks such as hierarchy and position of shortcuts,
rather than local properties of the nodes, such as the degree, are shown to be
the chief determinants of the influence of nodes in many cases. The developed
method is also applicable to the calculation of the PageRank. We also
numerically show that in a coupled oscillator system, the threshold for
entrainment by a pacemaker is low when the pacemaker is placed on influential
nodes. For a type of random network, the analytically derived threshold is
approximately equal to the inverse of the influence. We numerically show that
this relationship also holds true in a random scale-free network and a neural
network.

single branes and double branes, respectively. These branes have very rich
inner structure. In this paper, by presenting the mass-independent potentials
of Kaluza--Klein (KK) modes in the corresponding Schr\""{o}dinger equations, we
investigate the localization and mass spectra of fermions on the symmetric and
asymmetric thick branes in an AdS background. In order to analyze the effect of
gravity-fermion interaction (i.e., the effect of the inner structure of the
branes) and scalar-fermion interaction to the spectrum of fermion KK modes, we
consider three kinds of typical kink-fermion couplings. The spectra of left
chiral fermions for these couplings are consisted of a bound zero mode and a
series of gapless continuous massive KK modes, some discrete bound KK modes
including zero mode (exist mass gaps) and a series of continuous massive KK
modes, infinite discrete bound KK modes, respectively. The structures of the
spectra are investigated in detail.

We observed that at higher temperatures the mechanism responsible for aging
became faster thereby shifting the evolution of elastic modulus to lower ages.
Significantly, in the creep experiments, all the aging time and the temperature
dependent strain data superposed to form a master curve. Possibility of such
superposition suggests that the rheological behavior depends on the temperature
and the aging time only through the relaxation processes and both the variables
do not affect the distribution but only the average value of relaxation times.
In addition, this procedure allows us to predict long time rheological behavior
by carrying out short time tests at high temperatures and small ages.

simple geometric realizations, and we here deal with homotopy types represented
by lax diagrams of bicategories, that is, lax functors to the tricategory of
bicategories. In this paper, it is proven that, when a certain bicategorical
Grothendieck construction is performed on a lax diagram of bicategories, then
the classifying space of the resulting bicategory can be thought of as the
homotopy colimit of the classifying spaces of the bicategories that arise from
the initial input data given by the lax diagram. This result is applied to
produce bicategories whose classifying space has a double loop space with the
same homotopy type, up to group completion, as the underlying category of any
given (non-necessarily strict) braided monoidal category. Specifically, it is
proven that these double delooping spaces, for categories enriched with a
braided monoidal structure, can be explicitly realized by means of certain
genuine simplicial sets characteristically associated to any braided monoidal
categories, which we refer to as their (Street's) geometric nerves.

involution $\theta$. Denote by $K$ the subgroup of fixed points. In certain
cases, the $K$-orbits in the flag variety $G/B$ are indexed by the twisted
identities $\iot = \{\theta(w^{-1})w\mid w\in W\}$ in the Weyl group $W$. Under
this assumption, we establish a criterion for rational smoothness of orbit
closures which generalises classical results of Carrell and Peterson for
Schubert varieties. That is, whether an orbit closure is rationally smooth at a
given point can be determined by examining the degrees in a ``Bruhat graph''
whose vertices form a subset of $\iot$. Moreover, an orbit closure is
rationally smooth everywhere if and only if its corresponding interval in the
Bruhat order on $\iot$ is rank symmetric.
  In the special case $K=\Sp_{2n}(\C)$, $G=\SL_{2n}(\C)$, we strengthen our
criterion by showing that only the degree of a single vertex, the ``bottom
one'', needs to be examined. This generalises a result of Deodhar for type $A$
Schubert varieties.

through describing the stress fields in both a (0,90)s laminate in tension

investigated. Its rheological features are quantified using image analysis,
with measurements of the elastic stress, rate of plasticity, and velocity. The
behavior of the velocity strongly differs at the contraction entrance, where
the flow is purely convergent, and at the contraction exit, where a velocity
undershoot and a re-focussing of the streamlines are unraveled. The yielded
region, characterized by a significant rate of plasticity and a maximal stress
amplitude, is concentrated close to the contraction. These qualitative generic
trends do not vary significantly with the flow rate, bubble area and
contraction geometry, which is characteristic of a robust quasistatic regime.
Using surfactants with a high surface viscoelasticity, a marked dependence of
the elastic stress on the velocity is exhibited. The results show that the rate
of plasticity does not only depend on the local magnitude of the deformation
rate, but also crucially on the orientation of both elastic stresses and
deformation rate. It is also discussed how the viscous friction controls the
departure from the quasistatic regime.

onto hydrogen positions in water ice. Recently this analogy has been elevated
to an electromagnetic equivalence, indicating that the spin ice state is a
Coulomb phase, with magnetic monopole excitations analogous to ice's mobile
ionic defects. No Coulomb phase has yet been proved in a real magnetic
material, as the key experimental signature is difficult to resolve in most
systems. Here we measure the scattering of polarised neutrons from the
prototypical spin ice Ho2Ti2O7. This enables us to separate different
contributions to the magnetic correlations to clearly demonstrate the existence
of an almost perfect Coulomb phase in this material. The temperature dependence
of the scattering is consistent with the existence of deconfined magnetic
monopoles connected by Dirac strings of divergent length.

rotation as a convenient local probe, we apply the method to a real material:
the spin ice Dy2Ti2O7. Our experimental measurements prove that magnetic

measurable currents. We further characterise deviations from Ohm's Law, and
determine the elementary unit of magnetic charge to be 5 muB per Angstrom,
which is equal to that predicted by Castelnovo, Moessner and Sondhi using the
microscopic theory of spin ice. Our demonstration of magnetic charge transport

the specific problem of visual edges and textures perception and suggest that
these features may be represented at the population level in the visual cortex

its natural framework is the non-Euclidean hyperbolic geometry. This brings in
the beautiful structure of its group of isometries and certain of its subgroups
which have a direct interpretation in terms of the organization of the neural
populations that are assumed to encode the structure tensor. By studying the
bifurcations of the solutions of the structure tensor equations, the analog of
the classical Wilson and Cowan equations, under the assumption of invariance
with respect to the action of these subgroups, we predict the appearance of
characteristic patterns. These patterns can be described by what we call
hyperbolic or H-planforms that are reminiscent of Euclidean planar waves and of
the planforms that were used in [1, 2] to account for some visual
hallucinations. If these patterns could be observed through brain imaging
techniques they would reveal the built-in or acquired invariance of the neural

of a macroscopic body are incorrect in most circumstances,because they do not
take into account the locality of interactions, which characterizes the
behavior of all systems described approximately by local quantum field theory.
The deviations from classical behavior of a macroscopic body, except for those
that can be described as classical uncertainties in the initial values of
macroscopic variables,are {\it exponentially} small as a function of the volume
of the macro-system in microscopic units. Conventional estimates are correct
only when the internal degrees of freedom of the macrosystem are in their
ground state, and the classical motion of collective coordinates is adiabatic.
Otherwise, the system acts as its own environment and washes out quantum phase
correlations between different classical states of its collective coordinates.
I suggest that it is likely that we can only achieve meso-scopic
superpositions, for systems which have topological variables, and for which we
can couple to those variables without exciting phonons.

model (PRB 74, 014427 (2006)) involving a more local description of the
intersite interaction has been proposed to describe the phase diagram of

effect and frustration in which there is in particular the onset of a
cluster-glass state. Although the model given in Ref. PRB 74, 014427 (2006) has
reproduced the different phases relatively well, it is not able to describe the
cluster-glass state. We study here the competition between the Kondo effect and
a cluster glass phase within a Kondo Lattice model with an inter-cluster random
Gaussian interaction. The inter-cluster term is treated within the cluster
mean-field theory for spin glasses, while, inside the cluster, an exact
diagonalisation is performed including inter-site ferromagnetic and intra-site
Kondo interactions. The cluster glass order parameters and the Kondo
correlation function are obtained for different values of the cluster size, the
intra-cluster ferromagnetic coupling and the Kondo intra-site coupling. We
obtain, for instance, that the increase of the Kondo coupling tends to destroy
the cluster glass phase.

several million years. Theoretical modeling, on the other hand, raises several
questions. Firstly, dust coagulation occurs so rapidly, that if the small dust
grains are not replenished by collisional fragmentation of dust aggregates,
most disks should be observed to be dust poor, which is not the case. Secondly,
if dust aggregates grow to sizes of the order of centimeters to meters, they
drift so fast inwards, that they are quickly lost.
  Aims: We attempt to verify if collisional fragmentation of dust aggregates is
effective enough to keep disks 'dusty' by replenishing the population of small
grains and by preventing excessive radial drift.
  Methods: With a new and sophisticated implicitly integrated coagulation and
fragmentation modeling code, we solve the combined problem of coagulation,
fragmentation, turbulent mixing and radial drift and at the same time solve for
the 1-D viscous gas disk evolution.
  Results: We find that for a critical collision velocity of 1 m/s, as
suggested by laboratory experiments, the fragmentation is so effective, that at
all times the dust is in the form of relatively small particles. This means
that radial drift is small and that large amounts of small dust particles
remain present for a few million years, as observed. For a critical velocity of
10 m/s, we find that particles grow about two orders of magnitude larger, which
leads again to significant dust loss since larger particles are more strongly
affected by radial drift.

follow the suitable areas - their ""climate envelope"" - often risking
extinction. During this migration process, they may face absolute boundaries to
dispersal, because of external environmental factors. Consequently, not only
the position, but also the shape of the climate envelope can be modified. We
use a reaction-diffusion model to analyse the effects on population persistence
of simultaneous changes in the climate envelope position and shape. When the
growth term is of logistic type, we show that extinction and persistence are
principally conditioned by the species mobility and the speed of climate
change, but not by the shape of the climate envelope. However, with a growth
term taking an Allee effect into account, we find a high sensitivity to the
variations of the shape of the climate envelope. In this case, the species
which have a high mobility, although they could more easily follow the
migration of the climate envelope, would be at risk of extinction when
encountering a local narrowing of the boundary geometry. This effect can be
attenuated by a progressive opening of the available space at the exit of the
narrowing, even though it transiently leads to a diminished area of the climate
envelope.

effect of fragmentation. Within the class of reaction-diffusion models, studies
almost unanimously predict such a detrimental effect. In this paper,
considering a single-species reaction-diffusion model with a removal -- or

negative effects of fragmentation of the reserves, i.e. the protected regions
where no removal occurs. Fragmented reserves lead to higher population sizes

further show that most known NCs have masses < 10^8 Msun, while SMBHs

Cutting down running time is one of study focuses, and one way is to decrease

Special Local Clustering algorithm (SLC), then apply it to classify all cities

class cluster tightly in a small region. Secondly, let ACO act on every class
to get a local TSP route. Thirdly, all local TSP routes are jointed to form
solution. Fourthly, the inaccuracy of solution caused by clustering is
eliminated. Simulation shows that the presented method improves the running
speed of ACO by 200 factors at least. And this high speed is benefit from two
factors. One is that class has small size and parameter N is cut down. The
route length at every iteration step is convergent when ACO acts on compact
class. The other factor is that, using the convergence of route length as
termination criterion of ACO and parameter t is cut down.

electromagnetic wave in the beamsplitter. The use of updated parameters results
in the overall reduction of the calculated noise amplitude by a factor of about
5 in the low-frequency part of the GEO600 band, compared to the previous
estimates. We also find, by contrast with previous calculations, that
thermo-refractive fluctuations result in white noise between 600 Hz and 39 MHz,
at a level of $8.5\cdot 10^{-24}$Hz$^{-1/2}$. Finally, we describe a new type
of thermal noise, which we call the thermo-chemical noise. This is caused by a
random motion of optically-active chemical impurities or structural defects in
the direction along a steep intensity gradient of the standing wave. We discuss
the potential relevance of the thermo-chemical noise for GEO600.

the subsystems interact only via gravitation. The macrogas equation of state is
formulated and compared to the van der Waals equation of state for ordinary

occur as real isothermal curves in ordinary gases, where a phase transition
takes place along a horisontal line in the macrovolume-macropressure (Mv-Mp)
plane. A simple guidance case and two density profiles which satisfactorily fit
to observations or simulations, are studied in detail. For sufficiently steep
density profiles, a critical macroisothermal curve exists as shown by ordinary
gases, where the critical point coincides with the horisontal inflexion point.
By analogy with ordinary gases, the first quadrant of the (Mv-Mp) plane may be
divided into three parts, namely (i) the G region, where only gas exists; (ii)
the S region, where only stars exist; (iii) the GS region, where both gas and

investigated within the SAURON project. Different models characterized by equal
subsystem mass ratio and different scaled truncation radii, are considered and
the related position of sample objects on the (Mv-Mp) plane is determined.
Tipically, fast rotators are found to lie within the S region, while slow
rotators are close (from both sides) to the boundary between the S and the GS
region. The net effect of the uncertainty affecting observed quantities, on the
position of sample objects on the (Mv-Mp) plane, is also investigated. Finally,

such as lasers in optics and Bose-Einstein condensates in atomic gases and it
is a crucial issue for interferometry applications with light or matter waves.
Whereas the laser is an ""open"" quantum system, ultracold atomic gases are
weakly coupled to the environment and may be considered as isolated. The
coherence time of a condensate is then intrinsic to the system and its
derivation is out of the frame of laser theory. Using quantum kinetic theory,
we predict that the interaction with non-condensed modes gradually smears out
the condensate phase, with a variance growing as A t^2+B t+C at long times t,
and we give a quantitative prediction for A, B and C. Whereas the coefficient A
vanishes for vanishing energy fluctuations in the initial state, the
coefficients B and C are remarkably insensitive to these fluctuations. The
coefficient B describes a diffusive motion of the condensate phase that sets
the ultimate limit to the condensate coherence time. We briefly discuss the
possibility to observe the predicted phase spreading, also including the effect
of particle losses.

correlated electron systems, we propose a new theoretical method, where we
combine a Floquet-matrix method for AC-driven systems with the dynamical
mean-field theory. The method can treat nonequilibrium steady states exactly
beyond the linear-response regime. We have applied the method to the
Falicov-Kimball model coupled to AC electric fields, and numerically obtained
the spectral function, the nonequilibrium distribution function and the
current-voltage characteristic. The results show that intense AC fields indeed
drive Mott-like insulating states into photoinduced metallic states in a
nonlinear way.

detected at very high energy (VHE) gamma-rays. It is thus an important beacon
for the study of the interaction of the VHE gamma-rays with the Extra-galactic
Background Light (EBL). Previous observations by EGRET showed a highly variable
flux that can differ up to a factor of 100. In this paper results from an
observation campaign with the MAGIC telescope during an optical flare in
January 2007 will be presented and previous MAGIC results from 2006 will be
summarized.
