pockets in the presence of fluctuating spin density wave order. We generalize
this theory to an arbitrary band structure and ordering wavevector. The
transition to the large Fermi surface state, without pockets induced by local
spin density wave order, is described by embedding the U(1) gauge theory in a
SU(2) gauge theory. The phase diagram of the SU(2) gauge theory shows that the
onset of spin density wave order in the Fermi liquid occurs either directly, in
the framework discussed by Hertz, or via intermediate non-Fermi liquid phases
with Fermi surfaces of fractionalized excitations. We discuss application of
our results to the phase diagram of the cuprates.

calculate the correlation in the variability at the two frequencies in a subset

in the mass dependence of $p_T$ distributions and femtoscopic length scales,

from heavy ion collisions. This has been taken as evidence that p+p collisions
generate little collective flow, a conclusion in line with naive expectations.
We point out possible hazards of ignoring phase-space restrictions due to
conservation laws when comparing high- and low-multiplicity final states.
Already in two-particle correlation functions, we see clear signals of such
phase-space restrictions in low-multiplicity collisions at RHIC. We discuss how

satisfies $R_0+f(R_0)<0$. Interestingly, this expression is related to the
condition which guarantees the positivity of the effective Newton's constant in

with the spectra of a class of transitional objects, the Ofpe/WNL, an
intermediate evolutionary stage between massive O type stars leaving the main
sequence and evolving into Wolf-Rayets. Due to the wide range range in
Luminosity displayed by Ofpe/WNL stars, (log L/L_Sun ~ 5.3 - 6.2) distance
determinations are problematic. For OAO 1657-415 we report a distance of 4.4 <=

physical processes responsible for its unique position within the Corbet
diagram. Ofpe/WNL stars demonstrate a high rate of mass-loss through a dense
stellar wind combined with a low terminal velocity. This combination of wind
properties leads to a high accretion rate and transfer of angular momentum to
the neutron star in this system. We believe this in turn leads to a smaller

gauge structure of the Standard Model by anomalous extra U(1) symmetries, which
involve Stuckelberg axions for anomaly cancellation and are accompanied by
Chern-Simons interactions. In particular, these effective actions are
characterized by a physical pseudoscalar (the axi-Higgs) in the CP-odd
spectrum, which has the properties of a generalized Peccei-Quinn axion, with
independent mass and couplings to the gauge fields. Amplitudes mediated by
anomalous gauge interactions are studied at the new collider in some specific
channels such as Drell-Yan and double prompt-photon and shown to be small.
Finally, we address the problem of the relation between the Green-Schwarz and
the Wess-Zumino mechanism(s) for anomaly cancellations in effective lagrangeans
involving anomalous gauge interactions, with their gauge symmetry restored
either with local or non-local counterterms and identify some unitarity bounds
in the Wess-Zumino case. These are due to the presence of anomaly poles in
scattering amplitudes mediated by the anomaly (BIM amplitudes) and whose
cancellation requires necessarly non-local counterterms. While the axi-Higgs
appears in the Wess-Zumino case, two axion-like particles are needed for the
cancellation of the gauge anomalies at all scales, one of them being a ghost.

function to the square root of three two-point functions. This factorization is
known to hold for certain scaling operators at the two-dimensional percolation
point and in a few other cases. The correlation functions are evaluated in the
upper half-plane (or any conformally equivalent region) with operators at two
arbitrary points on the real axis, and a third arbitrary point on either the
real axis or in the interior. This type of result is of interest because it is
both exact and universal, relates higher-order correlation functions to
lower-order ones, and has a simple interpretation in terms of cluster or loop
probabilities in several statistical models. This motivated us to use the
techniques of conformal field theory to determine the general conditions for
its validity.
  Here, we discover a correlation function which factorizes in this way for any
central charge c, generalizing previous results. In particular, the
factorization holds for either FK (Fortuin-Kasteleyn) or spin clusters in the
Q-state Potts models; it also applies to either the dense or dilute phases of
the O(n) loop models. Further, only one other non-trivial set of highest-weight
operators (in an irreducible Verma module) factorizes in this way. In this case
the operators have negative dimension (for c < 1) and do not seem to have a
physical realization.

their lives as compact blue stars. Because of their extended structure, the
hydrodynamics favors more mixing and less fallback in the metal free stars than
the Z = 10^-4 models. As expected, higher energy explosions produce more
enrichment and less fallback than do lower energy explosions, and less massive

taking into account episodic phases of accretion at early stages of the
evolution, a scenario supported by recent large surveys of embedded protostars.
An evolution including short episodes of vigorous accretion ($\mdot \ge 10^{-4}
\msolyr$) followed by longer quiescent phases ($\mdot < 10^{-6} \msolyr$) can
explain the observed luminosity spread in HR diagrams of star forming regions
at ages of a few Myr, for objects ranging from a few Jupiter masses to a few
tenths of a solar mass. The gravitational contraction of these accreting
objects strongly departs from the standard Hayashi track at constant $\te$. The
best agreement with the observed luminosity scatter is obtained if most of the
accretion shock energy is radiated away. The obtained luminosity spread at 1
Myr in the HR diagram is equivalent to what can be misinterpreted as a $\sim$
10 Myr age spread for non-accreting objects. We also predict a significant
spread in radius at a given $\te$, as suggested by recent observations. These
calculations bear important consequences on our understanding of star formation
and early stages of evolution and on the determination of the IMF for young
($\le$ a few Myr) clusters. Our results also show that the concept of a stellar
birthline for low-mass objects has no valid support.

U-5f electrons undergo a multichannel Kondo effect, which is arrested at low

recently within the framework of the SDSS project. Recently, three hot DQ white
dwarfs have been reported to exhibit photometric variability with periods
compatible with pulsation g-modes. Here, we present a nonadiabatic pulsation
analysis of the recently discovered carbon-rich hot DQ white dwarf stars. One
of our main aims is to test the convective-mixing picture for the origin of hot
DQs through the pulsational properties. Our study relies on the full
evolutionary models of hot DQ white dwarfs recently developed by Althaus et al.
(2009), that consistently cover the whole evolution from the born-again stage
to the white dwarf cooling track. Specifically, we present a stability analysis
of white dwarf models from stages before the blue edge of the DBV instability
strip until the domain of the hot DQ white dwarfs, including the transition DB
--> hot DQ white dwarf. We found that at evolutionary phases in which the
models are characterized by He-dominated atmospheres, they exhibit unstable
$g$-mode pulsations typical of DBV stars, and when the models become DQ white
dwarfs with carbon-dominated atmospheres, they continue being pulsationally
unstable with similar characteristics than DB models, and in agreement with the
periods detected in variable hot DQ white dwarfs. Our calculations provide
strong support to the convective-mixing picture for the formation of hot DQs.
In particular, our results point to the existence of pulsating DB white dwarfs
with very thin He-rich envelopes, which after passing the DBV instability strip
become variable hot DQ stars. The existence of these DB stars with very thin
envelopes could be investigated through asteroseismology.

Mpc (~4000 galaxies). Galaxy cluster candidates are selected using photometric
redshifts computed with HyperZ. Morphologies are estimated with galSVM in two
broad morphological types (early-type and late-type). We examine the
morphological composition of the red-sequence and the blue-cloud and study the
relations between galaxies and their environment through the morphology-density
relations (T-Sigma) and the morphology-radius relation (T-R) in a mass limited
sample (log(M/Msol)>9.5). We find that the red sequence is already in place at
z~0.5 and it is mainly composed of very massive (log(M/Msol)>11.3) early-type
galaxies. These massive galaxies seem to be already formed when they enter the
cluster, probably in infalling groups, since the fraction remains constant with
the cluster radius. Their presence in the cluster center could be explained by
a segregation effect reflecting an early assembly history. Any evolution that
takes place in the galaxy cluster population occurs therefore at lower masses
(10.3<log(M/Msol)<11.3). For these galaxies, the evolution, is mainly driven by
galaxy-galaxy interactions in the outskirts as revealed by the T-Sigma
relation. Finally, the majority of less massive galaxies (9.5<log(M/Msol)<10.3)
are late-type galaxies at all locations, suggesting that they have not started
the morphological transformation yet even if this low mass bin might be
affected by incompleteness.

that the L_1-distance between P and Q can be estimated with a constant
precision using approximately N^{1/2} queries in the quantum settings, whereas
classical computers need \Omega(N) queries. We also describe quantum algorithms
for testing Uniformity and Orthogonality with query complexity O(N^{1/3}). The
classical query complexity of these problems is known to be \Omega(N^{1/2}).

one cluster (cl1232.5-1250) drawn from the ESO Distant Cluster Survey (EDisCS)
sample, at z = 0.54. The new data extend the spectroscopy already available for
this cluster by about 1 magnitude. The cluster has a large fraction of passive
galaxies and exhibits a well defined and relatively tight colour-magnitude
relation. Among spectroscopic members, only six galaxies are classified as
`post-starburst' (k+a). For another EDisCS cluster at similar redshift and with
as deep spectroscopy, no member is found to have a k+a spectrum. The low
measured numbers of post-starburst systems appear to be inadequate to explain
the observed increase of faint red galaxies at lower redshift, even when
accounting for the infall of new galaxies onto the cluster. Post-starburst
galaxies represent a possible channel to move galaxies from the blue
star-forming cloud to the red-sequence, but the available data suggest this is
not the dominant channel in galaxy clusters. If the galaxies at the faint end
of the red-sequence in nearby clusters originate from the blue galaxies
observed in distant galaxy clusters, the transformation must have occurred
primarily through physical processes that do not lead to a post-starburst
phase. In addition, our data exclude a large population of k+a galaxies at
faint magnitudes, as found in the Coma cluster.

the relative organization of three categorizations of metabolites -- pathways,
subcellular localizations and network clusters, by block-model techniques
borrowed from social-network studies and further characterize the categories
from topological point of view. The picture of the metabolism we obtain is that
of peripheral modules, characterized both by being dense network clusters and
localized to organelles, connected by a central, highly connected core.
Pathways typically run through several network clusters and localizations,
connecting them laterally. The strong overlap between organelles and network
clusters suggest that these are natural ""modules"" -- relatively independent
sub-systems. The different categorizations divide the core metabolism
differently suggesting that this, if possible, should be not be treated as a
module on par with the organelles. Although overlapping more than chance, none
of the pathways correspond very closely to a network cluster or localization.
This, we believe, highlights the benefits of different orthogonal
classifications and future experimental categorizations based on simple

physical content of these transformations, when applied to non-standard
gravity. The results obtained lead to a number of general conclusions on the
change of some key quantities describing any two conformally related
cosmological models. In particular, it is shown that the physics in the
Einstein frame has characteristics which are completely different from those in
the Jordan frame. Even if some of the geometrical properties of the cosmology
are preserved (homogeneous and isotropic Universes are mapped into homogeneous
and isotropic universes), it can happen that decelerating cosmologies are
mapped into accelerated ones. Differences become even more pronounced when
first-order perturbations are considered: from the 1+3 equations it is seen
that first-order vector and tensor perturbations are left unchanged in their
structure by the conformal transformation, but this cannot be said of the
scalar perturbations, which include the matter density fluctuations. Behavior
in the two frames of the growth rate, as well as other evolutionary features,
like the presence or absence of oscillations, etc., appear to be different too.
The results obtained are then explicitly interpreted and verified with the help

attributed to thermally induced ice segregation, but a lack of quantitative
experimental data has prevented its use as a temperature probe. Quantitative
segregation studies are also needed to characterize diffusion in ices, which
underpins all ice dynamics and ice chemistry. This study aims to quantify the
segregation mechanism and barriers in different H2O:CO2 and H2O:CO ice mixtures
covering a range of astrophysically relevant ice thicknesses and mixture
ratios. The ices are deposited at 16-50 K under (ultra-)high vacuum conditions.
Segregation is then monitored at 23-70 K as a function of time, through
infrared spectroscopy. Thin (8-37 ML) H2O:CO2/CO ice mixtures segregate
sequentially through surface processes, followed by an order of magnitude
slower bulk diffusion. Thicker ices (>100 ML) segregate through a fast bulk
process. The thick ices must therefore be either more porous or segregate
through a different mechanism, e.g. a phase transition. The segregation
dynamics of thin ices are reproduced qualitatively in Monte Carlo simulations
of surface hopping and pair swapping. The experimentally determined
surface-segregation rates for all mixture ratios follow the Ahrrenius law with
a barrier of 1080[190] K for H2O:CO2 and 300[100] K for H2O:CO mixtures. During
low-mass star formation H2O:CO2 segregation will be important already at 30[5]
K. Both surface and bulk segregation is proposed to be a general feature of ice
mixtures when the average bond strengths of the mixture constituents in pure
ice exceeds the average bond strength in the ice mixture.

Each odorant is therefore represented by a point in highly multidimensional
sensory space. In this work we study the arrangement of odorants in this
perceptual space. We argue that odorants densely sample a two-dimensional
curved surface embedded in the multidimensional sensory space. This surface can
account for more than half of the variance of the psychophysical data. We also
show that only 12 percent of experimental variance cannot be explained by
curved surfaces of substantially small dimensionality (<10). We suggest that
these curved manifolds represent the relevant spaces sampled by the human
olfactory system, thereby providing surrogates for olfactory sensory space. For
the case of 2D approximation, we relate the two parameters on the curved
surface to the physico-chemical parameters of odorant molecules. We show that
one of the dimensions is related to eigenvalues of the molecule connectivity
matrix, while the other is correlated with measures of the molecule polarity.

well-known blazars at opposite sides of the blazar sequence. PKS 2155-304 have
shown for the first time in an HBL a large Compton dominance, high gamma-ray
luminosities and a cubic relation between X-ray and VHE fluxes. 3C 279 is the
first FSRQ detected at VHE. The high luminosity required to overcome the
significant absorption caused by the BLR emission cannot be easily reconciled
with the historical and quasi-simultaneous SED properties. Both cases shed a
new light on the structure and ambient fields of blazars. Contrary to previous
claims, it is also shown that 3C 279 --as any FSRQ-- cannot in general provide
robust constraints on the EBL.

from conformal field theory (CFT) on the basis of conformal gravity in four

non-perturbatively without introducing its own coupling constant so that
conformal symmetry becomes exact quantum mechanically as a part of
diffeomorphism invariance. The traceless tensor mode is handled in the
perturbation with a dimensionless coupling constant indicating asymptotic
freedom, which measures a degree of deviation from CFT. There are no massive
ghosts because they are not gauge invariant in this formulation. Higher order
renormalization is carried out using dimensional regularization, in which the
Wess-Zumino integrability condition is applied to reduce indefiniteness
existing in higher-derivative actions. The effective action of quantum gravity
improved by renormalization group is obtained. We then make clear that
conformal anomalies are indispensable quantities to preserve diffeomorphism
invariance. Anomalous scaling dimensions of the cosmological constant and the
Planck mass are calculated. The effective cosmological constant is obtained in
the large number limit of matter fields.

hierarchy of biological parts. Each part in this hierarchy consists of a set of
attributes that define the part, such as sequence or rate constants. Models
that are constructed using these parts can be analyzed using various C and
Python programs that are hosted by TinkerCell via an extensive C and Python
API. TinkerCell supports the notion of a module, which are networks with
interfaces. Such modules can be connected to each other, forming larger modular
networks. Because TinkerCell associates parameters and equations in a model
with their respective part, parts can be loaded from databases along with their
parameters and rate equations. The modular network design can be used to
exchange modules as well as test the concept of modularity in biological
systems. The flexible modeling framework along with the C and Python API allows
TinkerCell to serve as a host to numerous third-party algorithms. TinkerCell is

These are observable in range of $E \sim 1$ GeV for atmospheric neutrino, where
solar and atmospheric oscillation couple. In this regime, the quasi-elastic

resolution is very poor. Unlike beam experiments this poor angular resolution
acts against its measurements. However, we find that one can be able to

of choices. In each round it chooses from a time-invariant set of alternatives
and receives the payoff associated with this alternative. While the case of
small strategy sets is by now well-understood, a lot of recent work has focused
on MAB problems with exponentially or infinitely large strategy sets, where one
needs to assume extra structure in order to make the problem tractable. In
particular, recent literature considered information on similarity between
arms.
  We consider similarity information in the setting of ""contextual bandits"", a
natural extension of the basic MAB problem where before each round an algorithm
is given the ""context"" -- a hint about the payoffs in this round. Contextual
bandits are directly motivated by placing advertisements on webpages, one of
the crucial problems in sponsored search. A particularly simple way to
represent similarity information in the contextual bandit setting is via a

mixing patterns are imposed on the so-called Who-Acquires-Infection-From-Whom

age-related social mixing behavior rather than observations. Alternatively, one
can assume that transmission rates for infections transmitted predominantly
through non-sexual social contacts, are proportional to rates of conversational
contact which can be estimated from a contact survey. In general, however,
contacts reported in social contact surveys are proxies of those events by
which transmission may occur and there may exist age-specific characteristics
related to susceptibility and infectiousness which are not captured by the
contact rates. Therefore, in this paper, transmission is modeled as the product
of two age-specific variables: the age-specific contact rate and an
age-specific proportionality factor, which entails an improvement of fit for
the seroprevalence of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in Belgium. Furthermore,
we address the impact on the estimation of the basic reproduction number, using
non-parametric bootstrapping to account for different sources of variability
and using multi-model inference to deal with model selection uncertainty. The
proposed method makes it possible to obtain important information on
transmission dynamics that cannot be inferred from approaches traditionally

show that an optically emitting filament can be formed by the break-up and
acceleration of a cloud into a supersonic wind. In this study we consider the
evolution of a cloud with two different geometries (fractal and spherical) and
investigate the importance of radiative cooling on the cloud's survival. We
have also undertaken a comprehensive resolution study in order to ascertain the
effect of the assumed numerical resolution on the results. We find that the
ability of the cloud to radiate heat is crucial for its survival. While an
adiabatic cloud is destroyed over a short period of time, a radiative cloud is
broken up via the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability into numerous small, dense
cloudlets, which are drawn into the flow to form a filamentary structure. The
degree of fragmentation is highly dependent on the resolution of the
simulation, with the number of cloudlets formed increasing as the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is better resolved. Nevertheless, there is a clear
qualitative trend, with the filamentary structure still persistent at high
resolution. We confirm the mechanism behind the formation of the H-alpha
emitting filaments found in our global simulations of a starburst-driven wind.
Based on our resolution study, we conclude that bow shocks around accelerated
gas clouds, and their interaction, are the main source of the soft X-ray
emission observed in these galactic-scale winds. [ABRIDGED]

to the general question) and allows for its immediate implementation that
avoids algorithmic difficulties of the original version.

new candidates with red 2MASS (J-K) colours. The opportunity is taken to
compare the near-IR spectra with those of Milky Way stars.
  Methods: We used ISAAC on the ESO VLT to take J and H-band spectra of 36
targets in Fornax, Sculptor and NGC 6822.
  Results: Twelve new C-stars are found in Fornax, and one is confirmed in
Sculptor. All C-stars have (J-K) > 1.6, and are brighter than -3.55 in
bolometric magnitude. Ten new oxygen-rich late-type giant stars are identified
in Fornax, but none is extremely red or very luminous. Five luminous O-rich AGB
stars are identified in NGC 6822, of which 3 show water absorption, indicative
of spectral type M. Again, none is as red as Milky Way OH/IR stars, but in this
galaxy the list of candidate AGB stars is biased against very red objects. In
some C-stars with (J-K)>2 an extremely strong 1.53 $\mu$m absorption band is
found. These stars are probably all Mira variables and the feature is related
to the low temperature, high density chemistry that is a first step towards
dust formation and mass loss.

sources, the apparent positions of these sources shift due to relativistic
effects and, thus, these events may be used for testing the theory of general
relativity; this fact was successfully demonstrated in the experiments on the
measurements of radio source position shifts during the approaches of Jupiter
carried out in 1988 and 2002. An analysis, performed within the frames of the
present work, showed that when a source is observed near a planet's disk edge,
i.e., practically in the case of occultation, the current experimental accuracy
makes it possible to measure the relativistic effects for all planets. However,
radio occultations are fairly rare events. At the same time, only Jupiter and
Saturn provide noticeable relativistic effects approaching the radio sources at
angular distances of about a few planet radii. Our analysis resulted in the
creation of a catalog of forthcoming occultations and approaches of planets to
astrometric radio sources for the time period of 2008-2050, which can be used
for planning experiments on testing gravity theories and other purposes. For
all events included in the catalog, the main relativistic effects are

enabling a secondary (unlicensed) transmitter-receiver pair to communicate over

propose cognitive MAC protocols optimized for both slotted and un-slotted
primary networks. For the slotted structure, the objective is to maximize the
secondary throughput while maintaining synchronization between the secondary
pair and not causing interference to the primary network. Our investigations
differentiate between two sensing scenarios. In the first, the secondary
transmitter is capable of sensing all the primary channels, whereas it senses
only a subset of the primary channels in the second scenario. In both cases, we
propose blind MAC protocols that efficiently learn the statistics of the
primary traffic on-line and asymptotically achieve the throughput obtained when
prior knowledge of primary traffic statistics is available. For the un-slotted
structure, the objective is to maximize the secondary throughput while
satisfying an interference constraint on the primary network. Sensing-dependent
periods are optimized for each primary channel yielding a MAC protocol which
outperforms previously proposed techniques that rely on a single sensing period
optimization.

integrals can be transformed into a tridiagonal real symmetric matrix $R_{mn}$,

extrapolation of the equation of state for these models. Due to a nearby
(nonphysical) singularity on the negative real z axis, standard methods (e.g.
Pad\`e approximants based on the cluster integrals expansion) fail to capture
the behavior of these models near the ordering transition, and, in particular,
do not detect the critical point. A recent work (Eisenberg and Baram, PNAS {\bf

$\sigma'$, characterizing the singularity of the density as a function of the

their asymptotic constant follows a $1/n^2$ law. Here we employ renormalization
arguments to extend this result and analyze cases for which the asymptotic

deconvolved well with models usually adopted to describe the emission from High
Mass X-ray Binary X-ray pulsars, and is characterized by a very high
absorption, a flat power law (photon index ~0.1-0.5) and a cutoff at about 7-12
keV. Alternatively, the SAXJ1818.6-1703 emission can be described with a
Comptonized emission from a cold and optically thick corona, with an electron
temperature kTe=5-7 keV, a hot seed photon temperature, kT0, of 1.3-1.4 keV,
and an optical depth for the Comptonizing plasma of about 10. The 1-100 keV
luminosity at the peak of the flare is 3E36 erg/s (assuming the optical
counterpart distance of 2.5 kpc). These properties of SAXJ1818.6-1703 resemble
those of the prototype of the SFXT class, XTEJ1739-302. The monitoring with

f_{NL} using the skewness power spectrum associated with the two-to-one
cumulant correlator of cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropies.
This bispectrum-related power spectrum was constructed after weighting the
temperature map with the appropriate window functions to form an estimator that
probes the multipolar dependence of the underlying bispectrum associated with
the primordial non-Gaussianity. We also estimate a separate skewness power
spectrum sensitive more strongly to unresolved point sources. When compared to
previous attempts at measuring the primordial non-Gaussianity with WMAP data,
our estimators have the main advantage that we do not collapse information to a
single number. When model fitting the two-to-one skewness power spectrum we
make use of bispectra generated by the primordial non-Gaussianity, radio point
sources, and lensing-secondary correlation. We analyze Q, V and W-band WMAP
5-year data using the KQ75 mask out to l_{max}=600. Using V and W-band data and
marginalizing over model parameters related to point sources and
lensing-secondary bispectrum, our overall and preferred constraint on f_{NL} is
11.0\pm23.7 at the 68% confidence level (-36.4 < f_{NL} < 58.4 at 95%
confidence). We find no evidence for a non-zero value of f_{NL} even marginally
at the 1\sigma level.

solutions prove to be interesting as are characterized by the production of
mass contributions arising from the nonlinear terms while maintaining a
wave-like behavior. So, a quartic massless equation has a nonlinear wave
solution with a dispersion relation of a massive wave and a quartic scalar
theory gets its mass term renormalized in the dispersion relation through a
term depending on the coupling and an integration constant. When spontaneous
breaking of symmetry is considered, such wave-like solutions show how a mass
term with the wrong sign and the nonlinearity give rise to a proper dispersion
relation. These latter solutions do not change the sign maintaining the
property of the selected value of the equilibrium state. Then, we use these
solutions to obtain a quantum field theory for the case of a quartic massless
field. We get the propagator from a first order correction showing that is
consistent in the limit of a very large coupling. The spectrum of a massless
quartic scalar field theory is then provided. From this we can conclude that,
for an infinite countable number of exact classical solutions, there exist an
infinite number of equivalent quantum field theories that are trivial in the

are comparable to the dynamical timescale of the gas.
  We also investigate the spatial distributions of H2 and CO, and how they
relate to the underlying gas distribution. We show that H2 is a good tracer of
the gas distribution, but that the relationship between CO abundance and gas
density is more complex. The CO abundance is not well-correlated with either
the gas number density n or the visual extinction A_V: both have a large
influence on the CO abundance, but the inhomogeneous nature of the density
field produced by the turbulence means that n and A_V are only poorly
correlated. There is a large scatter in A_V, and hence CO abundance, for gas
with any particular density, and similarly a large scatter in density and CO
abundance for gas with any particular visual extinction. This will have
important consequences for the interpretation of the CO emission observed from
real molecular clouds.
  Finally, we also examine the temperature structure of the simulated gas. We
show that the molecular gas is not isothermal. Most of it has a temperature in
the range of 10--20 K, but there is also a significant fraction of warmer gas,

protocols allow hosts within a network to have some knowledge of the topology
in order to know when to forward a packet (via broadcast) and when to drop it.
Since a routing protocol forms the backbone of a network, it is a lucrative
target for many attacks, all of which attempt to disrupt network traffic by
corrupting routing tables of neighboring routers using false updates. Secure
routing protocols designed for wired networks (such as S-BGP) are not scalable
in an ad-hoc wireless environment because of two main drawbacks: (1) the need
to maintain knowledge about all immediate neighbors (which requires a discovery
protocol), and (2) the need to transmit the same update several times, one for
each neighbor. Although information about neighbors is readily available in a
fairly static and wired network, such information is often not updated or
available in an ad-hoc wireless network with mobile devices. Our protocol is a
variant of S-BGP called SS-BGP and allows a single broadcast for routing
updates without having the need to be aware of every neighboring router. The
protocol is based on a novel authentication primitive called Enhanced Chain
Signatures (ECS).

Finally we give the restriction of the Hamilton equations and of the
constraints to the family of {\it non-harmonic 3-orthogonal} gauges, in which
the instantaneous Riemannian 3-spaces have a diagonal 3-metric. The non-fixed
inertial gauge variable ${}^3K$ (the freedom in the clock synchronization
convention) gives rise to a negative kinetic term in the weak ADM energy
vanishing only in the gauges with ${}^3K = 0$: is it relevant for dark energy
and back-reaction? In the second paper there will be the linearization of the
theory to obtain Hamiltonian post-Minkowskian gravity with asymptotic Minkowski
background, non-flat instantaneous 3-spaces and no post-Newtonian expansion.
This will allow to explore the inertial effects induced by the York time

provides information about the state of nature. The observation of the signal
allows the decision-maker to revise his prior and the second decision is taken
accordingly. Assuming that the first decision is a scalar representing
consumption, the \emph{precautionary effect} holds when initial consumption is
less in the prospect of future information than without (no signal).
\citeauthor{Epstein1980:decision} in \citep*{Epstein1980:decision} has provided
the most operative tool to exhibit the precautionary effect. Epstein's Theorem
holds true when the difference of two convex functions is either convex or
concave, which is not a straightforward property, and which is difficult to
connect to the primitives of the economic model. Our main contribution consists
in giving a geometric characterization of when the difference of two convex
functions is convex, then in relating this to the primitive utility model. With
this tool, we are able to study and unite a large body of the literature on the
precautionary effect.

  Astrophysics",,"10.1051/0004-6361/200912130",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Context. We compare solar differential rotation of subphotospheric layers
derived from local helioseismology analysis of GONG++ dopplergrams and the one
derived from tracing small bright coronal structures (SBCS) using EIT/SOHO
images for the period August 2001 - December 2006, which correspond to the
declining phase of solar cycle 23. Aims. The study aims to find a relationship
between the rotation of the SBCS and the subphotospheric angular velocity. The
northsouth asymmetries of both rotation velocity measurements are also
investigated. Methods. Subphotospheric differential rotation was derived using
ring-diagram analysis of GONG++ full-disk dopplergrams of 1 min cadence. The
coronal rotation was derived by using an automatic method to identify and track
the small bright coronal structures in EIT full-disk images of 6 hours cadence.
Results. We find that the SBCS rotate faster than the considered upper
subphotospheric layer (3Mm) by about 0.5 deg/day at the equator. This result
joins the results of several other magnetic features (sunspots, plages,
faculae, etc.) with a higher rotation than the solar plasma. The rotation rate
latitudinal gradients of the SBCS and the subphotospheric layers are very
similar. The SBCS motion shows an acceleration of about 0.005 deg/day/month
during the declining phase of solar cycle 23, whereas the angular velocity of
subsurface layers does not display any evident variation with time, except for
the well known torsional oscillation pattern. Finally, both subphotospheric and
coronal rotations of the southern hemisphere are predominantly larger than
those of the northern hemisphere. At latitudes where the north-south asymmetry
of the angular velocity increases (decreases) with activity for the SBCS, it
decreases (increases) for subphotospheric layers.

order parameter is sensitive to a global Z2 subgroup of the gauge symmetry
which is seen to break spontaneously at $\beta = 4/g^2 = 1.96\pm 0.01$. No
gauge fixing is required. Finite size scaling is consistent with a high-order
paramagnet to spin glass transition with a critical exponent $\nu = 0.99 \pm

glass to ferromagnet should exist at higher $\beta$.

3.8 and 3.9 Gyr ago, where the bulk of the craters we see on the Moon formed.
Even more craters formed on the Earth.
  During a field expedition to the 3.8 Gyr old Isua greenstone belt in
Greenland, we sampled three types of metasedimentary rocks, that contain direct
traces of the LHB impactors by a seven times enrichment (150 ppt) in iridium
compared to present day ocean crust (20 ppt).
  We show that this enrichment is in agreement with the lunar cratering rate,
providing the impactors were comets, but not if they were asteroids. Our study
is a first direct indication of the nature of the LHB impactors, and the first
to find an agreement between the LHB lunar cratering rate and the Earth's early
geochemical record (and the corresponding lunar record).
  The LHB comets that delivered the iridium we see at Isua will at the same
time have delivered the equivalent of a km deep ocean, and we explain why one
should expect a cometary ocean to become roughly the size of the Earth's
present-day ocean, not only in terms of depth but also in terms of the surface
area it covers.
