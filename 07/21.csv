stabilize weakly interacting, dark matter candidates. We examine the potential
for the CERN Large Hadron Collider to distinguish models with parity stabilized
dark matter from models in which the dark matter is stabilized by other
symmetries. In this letter, we focus on signatures involving long-lived
particles and large amounts of missing transverse energy. To illustrate these
signatures, we consider three models from the literature which are
representative of a more general class of models with non-traditional
stabilization symmetries. The most optimistic scenario can observe the proposed
signature with a minimum of 10 inverse fb of integrated luminosity at design
center of mass energy. It will probably take considerable longer to validate
the stabilizing symmetry is not a simple parity. In all, we emphasize that the
underlying symmetry that stabilizes weakly interacting dark matter has
tremendous implications for the LHC and our understanding of the nature of dark
matter.

($hp$-DG) methods for the Helmholtz equation in two and three dimensions. The
proposed $hp$-DG methods are defined using a sesquilinear form which is not
only mesh-dependent but also degree-dependent. In addition, the sesquilinear
form contains penalty terms which not only penalize the jumps of the function
values across the element edges but also the jumps of the first order
tangential derivatives as well as jumps of all normal derivatives up to order
$p$. Furthermore, to ensure the stability, the penalty parameters are taken as
complex numbers with positive imaginary parts. It is proved that the proposed
$hp$-discontinuous Galerkin methods are absolutely stable (hence, well-posed).
For each fixed wave number $k$, sub-optimal order error estimates in the broken
$H^1$-norm and the $L^2$-norm are derived without any mesh constraint. The
error estimates and the stability estimates are improved to optimal order under
the mesh condition $k^3h^2p^{-1}\le C_0$ by utilizing these stability and error
estimates and using a stability-error iterative procedure To overcome the
difficulty caused by strong indefiniteness of the Helmholtz problems in the
stability analysis for numerical solutions, our main ideas for stability
analysis are to make use of a local version of the Rellich identity (for the
Laplacian) and to mimic the stability analysis for the PDE solutions given in
\cite{cummings00,Cummings_Feng06,hetmaniuk07}, which enable us to derive
stability estimates and error bounds with explicit dependence on the mesh size
$h$, the polynomial degree $p$, the wave number $k$, as well as all the penalty
parameters for the numerical solutions.

present TWR spiral pattern speed estimates for M101, IC 342, NGC 3938 and NGC
3344 in order to investigate whether spiral structure is steady or winding,
whether spirals are described by multiple pattern speeds, and the relation
between bar and spiral speeds. Where possible, we interpret our pattern speeds
estimates according to the resonance radii associated with each (established
with the disk angular rotation), and compare these to previous determinations.
By analyzing the high-quality HI and CO data cubes available for these
galaxies, we show that it is possible to determine directly multiple pattern
speeds within these systems, and hence identify the characteristic signatures
of the processes that drive the spiral structure. Even this small sample of
galaxies reveals a surprisingly complex taxonomy, with the first direct
evidence for the presence of resonant coupling of multiple patterns found in
some systems, and the measurement of a simple single pattern speed in others.
Overall, this study demonstrates that we are now in a position to uncover more
of the apparently complex physics that lies behind spiral structure.

matter particles trapped within the Sun has been exploited to place indirect
limits on particle dark matter. In most models, the dark matter interacts
weakly, but the possibility of a dark matter particle with a large cross
section for elastic scattering with itself has been proposed in several
contexts. I study the consequences of such dark matter self-interactions for
the high-energy neutrino flux from annihilation within the Sun. The
self-interaction may allow dark matter in the halo to be captured within the
Sun by scattering off of previously-captured dark matter within the Sun. This
effect is not negligible in acceptable and accessible regions of parameter
space. Enhancements in the predicted high-energy neutrino flux from the Sun of
tens to hundreds of percent can be realized in broad regions of parameter
space. Enhancements as large as factors of several hundred may be realized in
extreme regions of the viable parameter space. Large enhancements require the
dark matter annihilation cross section to be relatively small, sigma*v <~
10^-27 cm^3/s. This phenomenology is interesting. First, self-capture is
negligible for the Earth, so dark matter self-interactions break the
correspondence between the solar and terrestrial neutrino signals. Likewise,
the correspondence between indirect and direct detection limits on scattering
cross sections on nuclei is broken by the self-interaction. These broken
correspondences may evince strong dark matter self-interactions. In some cases,
self-capture can lead to observable indirect signals in regions of parameter
space where limits on dark matter-nucleon cross sections from direct detection
would indicate that no such signal should be observable.

detected GRBs for which spectroscopic follow-up observations have been secured.
We provide linelists and equivalent widths for all detected lines redward of
Ly-alpha. We discuss to what extent the current sample of Swift bursts with OA
spectroscopy is a biased subsample of all Swift detected GRBs. For that purpose
we define an X-ray selected sample of Swift bursts with optimal conditions for
ground-based follow up from the period March 2005 to September 2008; 146 bursts
fulfill our sample criteria. We derive the redshift distribution for this
sample and conclude that less than 19% of Swift bursts are at z>7. We compare
the high energy properties for three sub-samples of bursts in the sample: i)
bursts with redshifts measured from OA spectroscopy, ii) bursts with detected
OA, but no OA-based redshift, and iii) bursts with no detection of the OA. The
bursts in group i) have significantly less excess X-ray absorption than bursts
in the other two groups. In addition, the fraction of dark bursts is 14% in
group i), 38% in group ii) and > 39% in group iii). From this we conclude that
the sample of GRBs with OA spectroscopy is not representative for all Swift
bursts, most likely due to a bias against the most dusty sight-lines. Finally,
we characterize GRB absorption systems as a class and compare them to QSO
absorption systems, in particular DLAs. On average GRB absorbers are
characterized by significantly stronger EWs for HI as well as for both low and
high ionization metal lines than what is seen in intervening QSO absorbers.
Based on the z>2 bursts in the sample we place a 95% confidence upper limit of
7.5% on the mean escape fraction of ionizing photons from star-forming
galaxies.

two distant parallel domain walls into a composite wall. The elementary wall
fluxes can be separated into parallel and antiparallel components. The parallel
component affects neither the binding energy nor the process of quantum merger.
The antiparallel fluxes, instead, increase the binding energy and, against
naive expectations, suppress quantum fusion. In the small flux limit we
explicitly find the bounce solution and the fusion rate as a function of the
flux. We argue that at large (antiparallel) fluxes there exists a critical
value of the flux (versus the difference in the wall tensions), which switches
off quantum fusion altogether. This phenomenon of flux-related wall
stabilization is rather peculiar: it is unrelated to any conserved quantity.
Our consideration of the flux-related all stabilization is based on
substantiated arguments that fall short of complete proof.

that $D$ waves have a significant impact on double-polarization observables

the $S$ wave and is a direct consequence of chiral symmetry and the
Nambu--Goldstone nature of the pion. $F$-wave contributions are shown to be
negligible in the near-threshold region.

rate is proportional to the infall rate, and governed by gravitational torques
generated by low-m spiral modes. We also confirm the existence of a maximum

study the near-nuclear regions of the galaxy (<1 kpc). In line with previous
observations, we find that 3C433 has an unresolved core source that is detected
in all near-IR bands, but dominates over the host galaxy emission at 2.05 um.
Our analysis reveals: (1) the presence of a dust lane aligned close to
perpendicular (PA$=70\pm5\degr$) to the inner radio jet axis
(PA$=-12\pm2\degr$); (2) a steep slope to the near-IR SED ($\alpha=5.8\pm0.1$;
F$_{\nu}\propto\nu^{-\alpha}$); (3) an apparent lack of broad permitted
emission lines at near-IR wavelengths, in particular the absence of a broad
Pa$\alpha$ emission line; and (4) high intrinsic polarization for the
unresolved core nuclear source ($8.6\pm1$ per cent), with an E-vector
perpendicular (PA=$83.0\pm 2.3\degr$) to the inner radio jet. Using five
independent techniques we determine an extinction to the compact core source in
the range 3<A_V<67 mag. An analysis of the long wavelength SED rules out a
synchrotron origin for the high near-IR polarization of the compact core
source. Therefore, scattering and dichroic extinction are plausible polarizing
mechanisms, although in both of these cases the broad permitted lines from the
AGN are required to have a width >10^4 km/s (FWHM) to escape detection in our
near-IR spectrum. Dichroic extinction is the most likely polarization mechanism
because it is consistent with the various available extinction estimates. In
this case, a highly ordered, coherent toroidal magnetic field must be present

derived from many orders enables the detection and the measurement of radial

already available spectra of HD188753, a well known triple system, yielding the
radial velocities of the faintest star in the system. This rendered the close
pair of the triple system a double-lined spectroscopic binary, which led to a

processes by which the mass loss from orbiting stars interacts with the
stationary hot gas for the case of the mass ejected in a planetary nebula
event. Numerical hydrodynamic simulations show that at first, the ejecta
expands nearly symmetrically, with an upstream bow shock in the hot ambient
gas. At later times, the flow past the ejecta creates fluid instabilities that
cause about half of the ejecta to separate and the other half to flow more
slowly downstream in a narrow wake. When radiative cooling is included, most of
the material in the wake (>80%) remains below 1E5 K while the separated ejecta
is hotter (1E5-1E6 K). The separated ejecta is still less than one-quarter the
temperature of the ambient medium and the only way it will reach the
temperature of the ambient medium is through turbulent mixing (after the
material has left the grid). These calculations suggest that a significant
fraction of the planetary nebula ejecta may not become part of the hot ambient
material. This is in contrast to our previous calculations for continuous mass
loss from giant stars in which most of the mass loss became hot gas. We
speculate that detectable OVI emission may be produced, but more sophisticated

spiral galaxies and it is related to the star formation rate, so it is likely
produced by the activity in the disk through a galactic fountain. More extended
examples of halo gas are seen, such as the HVC around the Milky Way and around

accretion onto galaxies such as the Milky Way. There is good evidence for
accretion of cold material onto the Milky Way and other galaxies, but it is not

properties in the disk. The reservoir of accretion material is as yet
unidentified. Some of these findings may be related to the issue that galaxies

construct models of the observed polarization signal from a finite surface
hotspot, using the latest NS atmosphere models for magnetic fields B = 4 x
10^13--5 x 10^14 G. Our calculations are strongly dependent on the NS magnetic
field strength and geometry, and are more weakly dependent on the NS equation
of state and atmosphere composition. We discuss how the complementary

introduce and characterize a pair of frequency-based nonhomogeneous dual

completely separate the perfect reconstruction property of a wavelet system
from its stability property in function spaces. The results in this paper lead
to a natural explanation for the oblique extension principle, which has been
widely used to construct dual wavelet frames from refinable functions, without
any a priori condition on the generating wavelet functions and refinable
functions. A nonhomogeneous wavelet system, which is not necessarily derived
from refinable functions via a multiresolution analysis, not only has a natural
multiresolution-like structure that is closely linked to the fast wavelet
transform, but also plays a basic role in understanding many aspects of wavelet
theory. To illustrate the flexibility and generality of the approach in this
paper, we further extend our results to nonstationary wavelets with real
dilation factors and to nonstationary wavelet filter banks having the perfect

characterizations in econometrics, for instance bounds on parameters under
conditional moment inequalities, can be formulated as intersection bounds. Our
approach is especially convenient for models comprised of a continuum of
inequalities that are separable in parameters, and also applies to models with
inequalities that are non-separable in parameters. Since analog estimators for
intersection bounds can be severely biased in finite samples, routinely
underestimating the size of the identified set, we also offer a
median-bias-corrected estimator of such bounds as a by-product of our
inferential procedures. We develop theory for large sample inference based on
the strong approximation of a sequence of series or kernel-based empirical
processes by a sequence of ""penultimate"" Gaussian processes. These penultimate
processes are generally not weakly convergent, and thus non-Donsker. Our
theoretical results establish that we can nonetheless perform asymptotically
valid inference based on these processes. Our construction also provides new
adaptive inequality/moment selection methods. We provide conditions for the use
of nonparametric kernel and series estimators, including a novel result that
establishes strong approximation for any general series estimator admitting

Here we present in detail an alternative method for directly calculating a

governing equation, which is linear. We apply the resulting spectral method to
three general models of stochastic gene expression: a single gene with multiple
expression states (often used as a model of bursting in the limit of two

regulation. In all cases we find either analytic results or numerical

BAT on board the Swift, we are able to study the spectral state transitions
occurred in about 20 bright persistent and transient black hole and neutron
star binaries. We have confirmed that there is a correlation between the X-ray
luminosity corresponding to the hard-to-soft transition and the X-ray
luminosity of the following soft state. This correlation holds over a
luminosity range spanning by two orders of magnitude, with no indication of a
flux saturation or cut-off. We have also found that the transition luminosity
correlates with the rate of increase in the X-ray luminosity during the rising
phase of an outburst or flare, implying that the origin of the variation of the
transition luminosity is associated with non-stationary accretion in both
transient sources and persistent sources. The correlation between the
luminosity corresponding to the end of the soft-to-hard transition and the peak
luminosity of the preceding soft state is found insignificant. The results
suggest that the hysteresis effect of spectral state transitions is primarily
driven by non-stationary accretion when the mass accretion rate increases
rather than the mass accretion rate decreases. Our results also imply that
Galactic X-ray binaries can reach more luminous hard states during outbursts of
higher luminosities and of similar rise time scales as those observed. Based on
the correlations, we speculate that bright hard state beyond the Eddington
luminosity will be observed in Galactic binaries in the next century. We also
suggest that some ultra-luminous X-ray sources in nearby galaxies, which stay
in the hard states during bright, short flares, harbor stellar-mass compact
stars.

solutions can be derived and discuss flavor constraints. The general
three-generation case is then treated using a simple numerical routine.
Assuming anarchic 5D parameters we find a fermion mass spectrum resembling the

Kaluza-Klein gauge bosons. This confirms that the soft-wall model has similar
attractive features as that found in hard-wall models, providing a framework to

non-preemptive execution where the value of each job (or the reward garnered
upon completion) decays over time. All jobs are initially available in a buffer
and the distribution of their service times are known. When a processor becomes
available, one must determine which free job to schedule so as to maximize the
total expected reward accrued for the completion of all jobs. Such problems
arise in diverse application areas, e.g. scheduling of patients for medical
procedures, supply chains of perishable goods, packet scheduling for
delay-sensitive communication network traffic, etc. Computation of optimal
schedules is generally intractable, while online low-complexity schedules are
often essential in practice.
  It is shown that the simple greedy/myopic schedule provably achieves
performance within a factor 2 + E[max_j sigma_j](min_j E[sigma_j]) from
optimal. This bound can be improved to a factor of 2 when the service times are
identically distributed. Various aspects of the greedy schedule are examined
and it is demonstrated to perform quite close to optimal in some practical
situations despite the fact that it ignores reward-decay deeper in time.

filtration on Chow groups of smooth projective varieties which is functorial
with respect to the action of correspondences and whose graded parts depend
solely on the topology -- i.e. the cohomology -- of $X$. In this paper, we wish
to explore, at the cost of having to assume general conjectures about algebraic
cycles, how the coniveau filtration on the cohomology of $X$ has an incidence
on the Chow groups of $X$. However, by keeping such assumptions minimal, we are
able to prove some of these conjectures either in low-dimensional cases or when
a variety is known to have small Chow groups. For instance, we give a new
example of a fourfold of general type with trivial Chow group of zero-cycles
and we prove Murre's conjectures for threefolds dominated by a product of
curves, for threefolds rationally dominated by the product of three curves, for
rationally connected fourfolds and for complete intersections of low degree.
The BBM conjectures are closely related to Kimura-O'Sullivan's notion of
finite-dimensionality. Assuming the standard conjectures on algebraic cycles
the former is known to imply the latter. We show that the missing ingredient
for finite-dimensionality to imply the BBM conjectures is the coincidence of a
certain niveau filtration with the coniveau filtration on Chow groups.

materials is the formation of secondary phases because of the solid-solubility
limit of magnetic ions in semiconductor host. In our study transition metal
ions were implanted into ZnO single crystals with the peak concentrations of
0.5-10 at.%. We established a correlation between structural and magnetic
properties. By synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction (XRD) secondary phases
(Fe, Ni, Co and ferrite nanocrystals) were observed and have been identified as
the source for ferromagnetism. Due to their different crystallographic
orientation with respect to the host crystal these nanocrystals in some cases
are very difficult to be detected by a simple Bragg-Brentano scan. This results
in the pitfall of using XRD to exclude secondary phase formation in DMS
materials. For comparison, the solubility of Co diluted in ZnO films ranges
between 10 and 40 at.% using different growth conditions pulsed laser
deposition. Such diluted, Co-doped ZnO films show paramagnetic behaviour.
However, only the magnetoresistance of Co-doped ZnO films reveals possible s-d
exchange interaction as compared to Co-implanted ZnO single crystals.

explicitly that the presence of next-nearest-neighbor hopping and
nearest-neighbor repulsion leads to supersolidity. Thus we present a
microscopic mechanism for the homogeneous coexistence of charge-density-wave
and superfluid orders.

We analyzed all
available observations carried out by RXTE on IGR J17473-2721 during its later
outburst and as well all the available SWIFT/BAT data. The flux of the latter
outburst rose in ~ one month and then kept roughly constant for the following ~
two months. During this time period, the source was in a low/hard state. The
source moved to a high/soft state within the following three days, accompanied
by the occurrence of an additional outburst at soft X-rays and the end of the
preceding outburst in hard X-rays. During the decay of this soft outburst, the
source went back to a low/hard state within 6 days, with a luminosity 4 times
lower than the first transition. This shows a full cycle of the hysteresis in
transition between the hard and the soft states. The fact that the flux
remained roughly constant for ~ two months at times prior to the spectral
transition to a high/soft state might be regarded as the result of balancing
the evaporation of the inner disk and the inward accretion flow, in a model in
which the state transition is determined by the mass flow rate. Such a balance
might be broken via an additional mass flow accreting onto the inner disk,
which lightens the extra soft outburst and causes the state transition.
However, the possibility of an origin of the emission from the jet during this
time period cannot be excluded. The spectral analysis suggests an inclined XRB
system for IGR J17473-2721. Such a long-lived preceding low/hard state makes
IGR J17473-2721 resemble the behavior of outbursts seen in black hole X-ray
binaries like GX 339-4.

densely populated clump of stars with an almost vertical structure in the

harbor either hot flasher stars, or canonical He-rich stars --progeny of the
blue Main Sequence sub population observed in this cluster-- or a mixture of
both types, plus possibly a component from the normal-He population hosted by
the cluster. A strong constraint coming from theory is that the mass of the
objects in the ""blue clump"" has to be very finely tuned, with a spread of at
most only $\sim$0.03Mo. By comparing observed and theoretical star counts along
both the H- and He-burning stages we then find that at least 15% of the
expected He-rich Horizontal Branch stars are missing from the color-magnitude
diagram. This missing population could be the progeny of red giants that failed
to ignite central He-burning and have produced He-core White Dwarfs. Our
conclusion supports the scenario recently suggested by Calamida et al. (2008)

strain to the system. The yield stress and yield strain of the system are
significantly reduced comparing to the prefect lattice. The dependence of
vacancy formation and binding energy as a function of strain is explored and
can be understood from the liquid-drop model. We find that the formation energy
of the vacancy clusters decreases monotonically as a function of the uniaxial
strain, while the formation energy increases first then decreases under the
volumetric tensile strain. The thermodynamic stability of the vacancy clusters
is analyzed by calculating the Gibbs free binding energy and the total
probability of dissociation of the vacancy clusters at 300 K and 900 K under

Layered superconductors can have a negative refraction index in a wide
frequency range for arbitrary incident angles. Indeed, low-Tc (s-wave)
superconductors allow to produce artificial heterostructures with low losses
for T<<Tc. However, the real part of their in-plane effective permittivity is
very large. Moreover, even at low temperatures, layered high-Tc superconductors
have a large in-plane normal conductivity, producing large losses (due to
d-wave symmetry). Therefore, it is difficult to enhance the evanescent modes in

Fe-monolayer on the fcc(001) surface of iridium. The Fe-monolayer has a strong
tendency to order antiferromagnetically for the true relaxed geometry. On the
contrary an unrelaxed Fe/Ir(001) sample has a ferromagnetic ground state. The
antiferromagnetism is thus stabilized by the decreased Fe-Ir layer spacing in
striking contrast to the recently experimentally observed antiferromagnetism of
the Fe/W(001) system which exists also for an ideal bulk-truncated, unrelaxed
geometry. The calculated layer relaxations for Fe/Ir(001) agree reasonably well
with recent experimental LEED data. The present study centers around the
evaluation of pair exchange interactions between Fe-atoms in the Fe-overlayer
as a function of the Fe/Ir interlayer distance which allows for a detailed
understanding of the antiferromagnetism of a Fe/Ir(001) overlayer. Furthermore,
our calculations indicate that the nature of the true ground state could be
more complex and display a spin spiral-like rather than a
c(2x2)-antiferromagnetic order. Finally, the magnetic stability of the Fe
monolayer on the Ir(001) surface is compared to the closely related Fe/Rh(001)

expensive in important large-scale applications. Fast iterative thresholding
algorithms have been intensively studied as alternatives to convex optimization
for large-scale problems. Unfortunately known fast algorithms offer
substantially worse sparsity-undersampling tradeoffs than convex optimization.
  We introduce a simple costless modification to iterative thresholding making
the sparsity-undersampling tradeoff of the new algorithms equivalent to that of
the corresponding convex optimization procedures. The new
iterative-thresholding algorithms are inspired by belief propagation in
graphical models. Our empirical measurements of the sparsity-undersampling

that a state evolution formalism correctly derives the true

alternative method based on L(hb) is less sensitive to ionization level and a
novel method, based on a combination of L(oiii 5007A) and L(oi 6300A), is

faster than assumed until now. Significant related other findings are: 1. Any
type-II AGN property related to the black hole (BH) mass is more reliably
obtained by removing blue galaxies from the sample. 2. Seyfert 2s and LINER 2s
form a continuous sequence of L/Ledd with no indication for a change in
accretion mechanism, or mode of mass supply. There are very few, if any, LINERs
in all type-I samples which results in a much arrower L/Ledd distribution
compared with type-II samples. 3. There is a strong correlation between SF
luminosity, Lsf, and Lbol over more than five orders of magnitude in
luminosity. This leads to a simple relationship between bulge and BH growth
rates, g(bulge)/g(BH) propto Lbol^(-0.2), where g(bulge)/g(BH) = 115 for
Lbol=10^42 erg/sec. Seyfert 2s and LINER 2s follow the same Lsf-Lbol
correlation for all sources with a stellar age indicator, D4000, smaller than
1.8. This suggests that a similar fraction of SF gas finds its way to the

realizes computing devices that make use of quantum mechanical principles, like
the superposition principle, entanglement, and interference. In this review we
study the information counterpart of computing. The abstract form of the
distributed computing setting is called communication complexity. It studies
the amount of information, in terms of bits or in our case qubits, that two
spatially separated computing devices need to exchange in order to perform some
computational task. Surprisingly, quantum mechanics can be used to obtain
dramatic advantages for such tasks.
  We review the area of quantum communication complexity, and show how it
connects the foundational physics questions regarding non-locality with those
of communication complexity studied in theoretical computer science. The first
examples exhibiting the advantage of the use of qubits in distributed
information-processing tasks were based on non-locality tests. However, by now
the field has produced strong and interesting quantum protocols and algorithms
of its own that demonstrate that entanglement, although it cannot be used to
replace communication, can be used to reduce the communication exponentially.
In turn, these new advances yield a new outlook on the foundations of physics,

complex surface superstructures is extracted by the changing vibration
frequency of a scanning tip. An alternative dissipation topography with similar
or even better contrast has been demonstrated recently by mapping the
(x,y)-dependent tip damping but the detailed damping mechanism is still
unknown. Here we identify two different tip dissipation mechanisms: local
mechanical softness and hysteresis. Motivated by recent data, we describe both
of them in a onedimensional model of Moire' superstructures of incommensurate
overlayers. Local softness at ""soliton"" defects yields a dissipation contrast
that can be much larger than the corresponding density or corrugation contrast.
At realistically low vibration frequencies, however, a much stronger and more
effective dissipation is caused by the tip-induced nonlinear jumping of the
soliton, naturally developing bistability and hysteresis. Signatures of this
mechanism are proposed for experimental identification.

with late stage transverse expansion. A phenomenological model has been used
for the time evolution of hard momentum scale $p_{\rm hard}(\tau)$ and
anisotropy parameter $\xi(\tau)$. As a result of pre-equilibrium momentum-space
anisotropy, we find significant modification of photons rapidity distribution.
For example, with {\em fixed initial condition} (FIC) {\em free-streaming}
($\delta=2$) interpolating model we observe significant enhancement of photon
rapidity distribution at fixed $p_T$, where as for FIC {\em
collisionally-broadened} ($\delta=2/3$) interpolating model the yield increases
till $y \sim 1$. Beyond that suppression is observed. With {\em fixed final

enhancement of photon yield which is less than the case of FIC. Suppression is

Auto-Correlation Spectral Imaging System (ACSIS) that have recently been
installed and commissioned on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). The
16-element focal-plane array receiver, operating in the submillimetre from 325
to 375 GHz, offers high (three-dimensional) mapping speeds, along with
significant improvements over single-detector counterparts in calibration and
image quality. Receiver temperatures are $\sim$120 K across the whole band and
system temperatures of $\sim$300K are reached routinely under good weather
conditions. The system includes a single-sideband filter so these are SSB
figures. Used in conjunction with ACSIS, the system can produce large-scale
maps rapidly, in one or more frequency settings, at high spatial and spectral
resolution. Fully-sampled maps of size 1 square degree can be observed in under
1 hour.
  The scientific need for array receivers arises from the requirement for
programmes to study samples of objects of statistically significant size, in
large-scale unbiased surveys of galactic and extra-galactic regions. Along with
morphological information, the new spectral imaging system can be used to study
the physical and chemical properties of regions of interest. Its
three-dimensional imaging capabilities are critical for research into
turbulence and dynamics. In addition, HARP/ACSIS will provide highly
complementary science programmes to wide-field continuum studies, and produce
the essential preparatory work for submillimetre interferometers such as the
SMA and ALMA.

classical Hanbury Brown - Twiss intensity interferometer (time resolution ~0.4

of dipolar excitons determined by the appearance of a narrow luminescence line
of exciton condensate at optical pumping increase. The two-photon correlation
function shows super-poissonian distribution at time scales of system coherence
(<~1 ns). No photon bunching was observed at the excitation pumping appreciably
below the condensation threshold. At excitation pumping increasing well above
the threshold, when the narrow line of exciton condensate grows in the

the two-photon correlator becomes poissonian reflecting the
single-quantum-state origin of excitonic Bose condensate. Under the same

significant. The discovered photon bunching is rather sensitive to temperature:
it drops several times with temperature increase from 0.45 K up to 4.2 K. If

to account for the fields presently observed in galaxies and galaxy clusters.
In an alternative scenario, cosmic B fields are generated near the inner edges
of accretion disks in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) by azimuthal electric
currents due to the difference between the plasma electron and ion velocities
that arises when the electrons are retarded by interactions with photons. While
dynamo processes show no preference for the polarity of the (presumably random)
seed field that they amplify, this alternative mechanism uniquely relates the
polarity of the poloidal B field to the angular velocity of the accretion disk,
resulting in a unique direction for the toroidal B field induced by disk
rotation. Observations of the toroidal fields of 29 AGN jets revealed by
parsec-scale Faraday rotation measurements show a clear asymmetry that is
consistent with this model, with the probability that this asymmetry came about
by chance being less than 1%. This lends support to the hypothesis that the
Universe is seeded by B fields that are generated in AGN via this mechanism and
subsequently injected into intergalactic space by the jet outflows.

formed are O2, CO, SiS, and SO. The SiO, formed as early as 200 days after
explosion, is rapidly depleted by the formation of silica molecular precursors
in the ejecta. The rapid conversion of CO to C2 and its thermal fractionation
at temperatures above 5000 K allow for the formation of carbon chains in the

formation of carbon dust in hot environments where the C/O ratio is less than

systems, and the ultimate performance limit of amplifiers is set by quantum
physics. Increasing the amplitude of an unknown quantum optical field, or more
generally any harmonic oscillator state, must introduce noise. This linear
amplification noise prevents the perfect copying of the quantum state, enforces
quantum limits on communications and metrology, and is the physical mechanism
that prevents the increase of entanglement via local operations. It is known
that non-deterministic versions of ideal cloning and local entanglement
increase (distillation) are allowed, suggesting the possibility of
non-deterministic noiseless linear amplification. Here we introduce, and
experimentally demonstrate, such a noiseless linear amplifier for
continuous-variables states of the optical field, and use it to demonstrate
entanglement distillation of field-mode entanglement. This simple but powerful
circuit can form the basis of practical devices for enhancing quantum

in the large N theory. Here, we use this technique to investigate SU(N) gauge
theory with a number N_f of massive adjoint-valued Majorana fermions having
non-thermal boundary conditions around S^1. For N_f =1 we find a line of
transitions that separate the weak-coupling analogues of the confined and
de-confined phases for which the density of eigenvalues of the Wilson line
transform from the uniform distribution to a gapped distribution. However, the
situation for N_f >1 is much richer and a series of weak-coupling analogues of
partially-confined phases appear which leave unbroken a Z_p subgroup of the
centre symmetry. In these Z_p phases the eigenvalue density has p gaps and they
are separated from the confining phase and from one-another by first order
phase transitions. We show that for small enough mR (the mass of the fermions
times the radius of the S^3) only the confined phase exists. The large N phase
diagram is consistent with the finite N result and with other approaches based

tests at frequencies varying from 5.10-3 Hz to 10 Hz. Conceived to work up to 5
bar, it allows tests in dry or water-saturated conditions to be performed over
the temperature range 0\degree C to 140\degree C. In spite of these severe
working conditions, the careful device design, together with a rigorous data
analysis, allows a rigorous determination of the storage and loss modulus and
the loss factor. The results collected for several species of wood emphasize
the ability of the WAVET to underline the influence of numerous parameters,
namely specie, material direction, anatomical and macromolecular structure, on
the rheological properties and notably on the softening temperature. The WAVET
also establishes a efficient tool to follow the modifications of the
constitutive amorphous polymers of materials submitted to hydrothermal
treatments, in relation to the evolution of their viscoelastic properties.

0.008 M$_{\oplus}$ with a net limit $\la 0.0025$ M$_{\oplus}$ for the average

under-determined system of linear equations. Although this problem seems rather
hard certain $\ell_1$-optimization algorithm appears to be very successful in
solving it. The recent work of \cite{CRT,DonohoPol} rigorously proved (in a
large dimensional and statistical context) that if the number of equations
(measurements in the compressed sensing terminology) in the system is
proportional to the length of the unknown vector then there is a sparsity
(number of non-zero elements of the unknown vector) also proportional to the
length of the unknown vector such that $\ell_1$-optimization algorithm succeeds
in solving the system. In more recent papers
\cite{StojnicICASSP09block,StojnicJSTSP09} we considered the setup of the
so-called \textbf{block}-sparse unknown vectors. In a large dimensional and
statistical context, we determined sharp lower bounds on the values of
allowable sparsity for any given number (proportional to the length of the
unknown vector) of equations such that an $\ell_2/\ell_1$-optimization
algorithm succeeds in solving the system. The results established in
\cite{StojnicICASSP09block,StojnicJSTSP09} assumed a fairly large block-length
of the block-sparse vectors. In this paper we consider the block-length to be a
parameter of the system. Consequently, we then establish sharp lower bounds on
the values of the allowable block-sparsity as functions of the block-length.

4He. We have studied solid 4He in two dimensions (2D) as function of the number
of vacancies n_v, up to 30, inserted in the initial configuration at rho =
0.0765 A^-2, close to the melting density, with the exact zero temperature
Shadow Path Integral Ground State method. The crystalline order is found to be
stable also in presence of many vacancies and we observe two completely
different regimes. For small n_v, up to about 6, vacancies form a bound state
and cause a decrease of the crystalline order. At larger n_v, the formation
energy of an extra vacancy at fixed density decreases by one order of magnitude
to about 0.6 K. In the equilibrated state it is no more possible to recognize
vacancies because they mainly transform into quantum dislocations and
crystalline order is found almost independent on how many vacancies have been
inserted in the initial configuration. The one--body density matrix in this
latter regime shows a non decaying large distance tail: dislocations, that in
2D are point defects, turn out to be mobile, their number is fluctuating, and
they are able to induce exchanges of particles across the system mainly
triggered by the dislocation cores. These results indicate that the notion of
incommensurate versus commensurate state loses meaning for solid 4He in 2D,
because the number of lattice sites becomes ill defined when the system is not
commensurate. Crystalline order is found to be stable also in 3D in presence of
up to 100 vacancies.

classification of high-dimensional data according to a binary label. We propose
an algorithm whose aim is twofold: First it learns a classifier from a
relatively small number of data, second it extracts a sparse signature, {\it
i.e.} a lower-dimensional subspace carrying the information needed for the
classification. In particular the second part of the task is NP-hard, therefore
we propose a statistical-mechanics based message-passing approach. The
resulting algorithm is firstly tested on artificial data to prove its validity,
but also to elucidate possible limitations.
  As an important application, we consider the classification of
gene-expression data measured in various types of cancer tissues. We find that,
despite the currently low quantity and quality of available data (the number of
available samples is much smaller than the number of measured genes, limiting
thus strongly the predictive capacities), the algorithm performs slightly
better than many state-of-the-art approaches in bioinformatics.
