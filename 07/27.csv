the galactic bulge. The stars presented here are the only 13 stars with
detectable Lithium line (6767.18 A) among ~400 stars for which we have spectra
in this wavelength range, half of them in Baade's Window (b=-4) and half in a
field at b=-6. The stars were observed with the GIRAFFE spectrograph of
FLAMES@VLT, with a spectral resolution of R~20,000. Abundances were derived via
spectral synthesis and the results are compared with those for stars with
similar parameters, but no detectable Li line. We find 13 stars with a
detectable Li line, among which 2 have abundances A(Li)>2.7. No clear
correlations were found between the Li abundance and those of other elements.
With the exception of the two most Li rich stars, the others follow a fairly
tight A(Li)-T_eff correlation. It would seems that there must be a Li
production phase during the red giant branch (RGB), acting either on a very
short timescale, or selectively only in some stars. The proposed Li production
phase associated with the RGB bump cannot be excluded, although our targets are
significantly brighter than the predicted RGB bump magnitude for a population
at 8 kpc

many Bosons make use of importance sampling. The importance sampling is based,
either on a guiding function or on an initial variational wave function. Here
we investigate the need of importance sampling in the case of Path Integral
Ground State (PIGS) Monte Carlo. PIGS is based on a discrete imaginary time
evolution of an initial wave function with a non zero overlap with the ground
state, that gives rise to a discrete path which is sampled via a Metropolis
like algorithm. In principle the exact ground state is reached in the limit of
an infinite imaginary time evolution, but actual computations are based on
finite time evolutions and the question is whether such computations give
unbiased exact results. We have studied bulk liquid and solid 4He with PIGS by
considering as initial wave function a constant, i.e. the ground state of an
ideal Bose gas. This implies that the evolution toward the ground state is
driven only by the imaginary time propagator, i.e. there is no importance
sampling. For both the phases we obtain results converging to those obtained by
considering the best available variational wave function (the Shadow wave
function) as initial wave function. Moreover we obtain the same results even by
considering wave functions with the wrong correlations, for instance a wave
function of a strongly localized Einstein crystal for the liquid phase. This
convergence is true not only for diagonal properties such as the energy, the
radial distribution function and the static structure factor, but also for
off-diagonal ones, such as the one--body density matrix. From this analysis we
conclude that zero temperature PIGS calculations can be as unbiased as those of
finite temperature Path Integral Monte Carlo.

the overall mass density has the strongest chances to be biased due to the

the distance at which X may exist for different values of its mass, ranging

X located perpendicularly to the ecliptic, while the maximum distance is for X

distance for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) as a function of redshift, and to set
observational constraints on the dark energy contribution to the total energy
content of the Universe. The CSP differs from other projects to date in its
goal of providing an I-band {rest-frame} Hubble diagram. Here we present the
first results from near-infrared (NIR) observations obtained using the Magellan
Baade telescope for SNe Ia with 0.1 < z < 0.7. We combine these results with
those from the low-redshift CSP at z <0.1 (Folatelli et al. 2009). We present
light curves and an I-band Hubble diagram for this first sample of 35 SNe Ia
and we compare these data to 21 new SNe Ia at low redshift. These data support
the conclusion that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating. When
combined with independent results from baryon acoustic oscillations (Eisenstein
et al. 2005), these data yield Omega_m = 0.27 +/- 0.0 (statistical), and
Omega_DE = 0.76 +/- 0.13 (statistical) +/- 0.09 (systematic), for the matter
and dark energy densities, respectively. If we parameterize the data in terms
of an equation of state, w, assume a flat geometry, and combine with baryon
acoustic oscillations, we find that w = -1.05 +/- 0.13 (statistical) +/- 0.09
(systematic). The largest source of systematic uncertainty on w arises from
uncertainties in the photometric calibration, signaling the importance of
securing more accurate photometric calibrations for future supernova cosmology
programs. Finally, we conclude that either the dust affecting the luminosities
of SNe Ia has a different extinction law (R_V = 1.8) than that in the Milky Way
(where R_V = 3.1), or that there is an additional intrinsic color term with
luminosity for SNe Ia independent of the decline rate.

functions of time. In the case of black holes immersed in universe driven by
phantom energy, we show that for specific ranges of the equation-of-state
parameter and apparent horizons the entropy is compatible with the D-bound
conjecture, even the null, dominant and strong energy conditions are violated.
In the case of accretion of phantom energy onto black hole with small
Hawking-Hayward quasi-local mass, we obtain an equation-of-state parameter in
the range $w\leq-5/3$, guaranteeing the validity of the generalized second law.

the flare, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) loops displayed two times of sideward
motions upon a loop-top hard X-ray source with average velocities of 75 and
25.6 km/s, respectively. We consider these two motions to be the observational
evidence of reconnection inflow, and find an X-shaped structure upon the
post-flare loops during the period of the second motion. Two separations of the
flare ribbons are associated with these two sideward motions, with average
velocities of 3.3 and 1.3 km/s, separately. Using the observation of
photospheric magnetic field, the velocities of the sideward motions and the
separations, we deduce the corresponding coronal magnetic field strength to be
about 13.2-15.2 G, and estimate the reconnection rates to be 0.05 and 0.02 for
these two magnetic reconnection processes, respectively. We also observe
motions of bright points upward and downward along the EUV loops with
velocities ranging from 45.4 to 556.7 km/s. A cloud of bright material flowing
outward from the loop-top hard X-ray source with an average velocity of 51 km/s
in the process of the flare may be accelerated by the tension force of the
newly reconnected magnetic field lines. All the observations can be explained
by schematic diagrams of magnetic reconnection.

it is appropriate to define it in formal-language terms as the number of

problem of finding the quotient complexity of a language f(K,L) is considered,
where K and L are regular languages and f is a regular operation, for example,

can find a formula for the typical quotient of f(K,L) in terms of the quotients
of K and L. To obtain an upper bound on the number of quotients of f(K,L) all
one has to do is count how many such quotients are possible, and this makes
automaton constructions unnecessary. The advantages of this point of view are

formation, we observed two Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs) that remain absorption
features up to 70mum wavelength, with the PdBI in the 3.23mm dust continuum as
well as the N2H+(1--0) and 13CS(2-1) line emission. While IRDC19175-4 is
clearly detected in the 3.23mm continuum, the second source in the field,
IRDC19175-5, is only barely observable above the 3sigma continuum detection
threshold. However, the N2H+(1-0) observations reveal 17 separate sub-sources
in the vicinity of the two IRDCs. Most of them exhibit low levels of turbulence
(dv \leq 1km/s), indicating that the fragmentation process in these cores may
be dominated by the interplay of thermal pressure and gravity, but not so much
by turbulence. Combining the small line widths with the non-detection up to
70mum and the absence of other signs of star formation activity, most of these
17 cores with masses between sub-solar to ~10M_sun are likely still in a
starless phase. Furthermore, we find a large CS depletion factor of the order
100. Although the strongest line and continuum peak is close to virial
equilibrium, its slightly broader line width compared to the other cores is
consistent with it being in a contraction phase potentially at the verge of
star formation. The relative peak velocities between neighboring cores are
usually below 1km/s, and we do not identify streaming motions along the
filamentary structures. Average densities are between 10^5 and 10^6cm^{-3} (one
to two orders of magnitude larger than for example in the Pipe nebula) implying
relatively small Jeans-lengths that are consistent with the observed core
separations of the order 5000AU. The quest for high-mass starless cores prior
to any star formation activity remains open.

time $O(m) + 2^{O(k^2)}$ whether a given multiset of $m$ clauses of size $r$
admits a truth assignment that satisfies at least $((2^r-1)m+k)/2^r$ clauses.
Thus \textsc{Max-$r$-Sat} is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by
the number of satisfied clauses above the tight lower bound $(1-2^{-r})m$. This
solves an open problem of Mahajan et al. (J. Comput. System Sci., 75, 2009).
  Our algorithm is based on a polynomial-time data reduction procedure that
reduces a problem instance to an equivalent algebraically represented problem
with $O(k^2)$ variables. This is done by representing the instance as an
appropriate polynomial, and by applying a probabilistic argument combined with
some simple tools from Harmonic analysis to show that if the polynomial cannot
be reduced to one of size $O(k^2)$, then there is a truth assignment satisfying
the required number of clauses.
  We introduce a new notion of bikernelization from a parameterized problem to
another one and apply it to prove that the above-mentioned parameterized
\textsc{Max-$r$-Sat} admits a polynomial-size kernel.
  Combining another probabilistic argument with tools from graph matching
theory and signed graphs, we show that if an instance of \textsc{Max-2-Sat}
with $m$ clauses has at least $3k$ variables after application of certain
polynomial time reduction rules to it, then there is a truth assignment that
satisfies at least $(3m+k)/4$ clauses.
  We also outline how the fixed-parameter tractability and polynomial-size
kernel results on \textsc{Max-$r$-Sat} can be extended to more general families
of Boolean Constraint Satisfaction Problems.

Gamma-ray Space Telescope. It was subsequently monitored over the X-ray and
UV/optical bands by Swift, in the optical by ROTSE and a host of other
telescopes and was detected in the radio by the VLA. The redshift of z= 3.355
+/- 0.005 was determined by Keck/HIRES and confirmed by RTT150 and NOT. The
prompt gamma/X-ray emission, detected over 0.3-10^3 keV, systematically softens
over time, with E_peak moving from ~600 keV at the start to ~40 keV around 100
s after the trigger; alternatively, this spectral evolution could be identified
with the blackbody temperature of a quasithermal model shifting from ~60 keV to
~3 keV over the same time interval. The first optical detection was made at 38
s, but the smooth, featureless profile of the full optical coverage implies
that this originated from the afterglow component, not the pulsed/flaring
prompt emission.
  Broadband optical and X-ray coverage of the afterglow at the start of the
final X-ray decay (~8 ks) reveals a spectral break between the optical and
X-ray bands in the range 10^15 - 2x10^16 Hz. The decay profiles of the X-ray
and optical bands show that this break initially migrates blueward to this
frequency and then subsequently drifts redward to below the optical band by
~3x10^5 s. GRB 080810 was very energetic, with an isotropic energy output for
the prompt component of 3x10^53 erg and 1.6x10^52 erg for the afterglow; there
is no evidence for a jet break in the afterglow up to six days following the
burst.

Resolution of unusual and interesting behaviour not seen in colloidal trapping

spectral methods to perform a parameter study of the Brownian motion of
optically trapped liquid aerosol droplets concentrated around the critically
damped regime. We present evidence that the system is suitably described by a
simple harmonic oscillator model which must include a description of
Fax\'{e}n's correction, but not necessarily frequency dependent hydrodynamic
corrections to Stokes' law. We also provide results describing how the system
behaves under several variables and discuss the difficulty in decoupling the
parameters responsible for the observed behaviour. We show that due to the
relatively low dynamic viscosity and high trap stiffness it is easy to transfer
between over- and under-damped motion by experimentally altering either trap
stiffness or damping. Our results suggest stable aerosol trapping may be
achieved in under-damped conditions, but the onset of deleterious optical
forces at high trapping powers prevents the probing of the upper stability

potentially very sensitive tool to search for non V-A components in the
charge-changing weak interaction. To reach the required precision (percent
level) all effects that modify the emission pattern of the beta radiation, i.e.
the geometry of the setup, the effect of the magnetic field on the trajectories
of beta particles as well as (back)scattering in the source, on the sample
holder and on the detector, have to be correctly taken into account in the
analysis of the data. A thorough study of these effects and a new method based
on detailed GEANT4 Monte-Carlo simulations that was developed for this purpose
is presented here. The code was developed for beta asymmetry measurements by
means of the Low Temperature Nuclear Orientation (LTNO) method, but can in
principle be generalized to other experimental setups using other polarization
techniques.

of pairing fluctuations, we calculate the single-particle density of states
(DOS), as well as the spectral weight, over the entire BCS-BEC crossover region
above the superfluid phase transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$. Starting from
the weak-coupling BCS regime, we show that the so-called pseudogap develops in
DOS above $T_{\rm c}$, which becomes remarkable in the crossover region. The
pseudogap structure continuously changes into a fully gapped one in the
strong-coupling BEC regime, where the gap energy is directly related to the
binding energy of tightly bound molecules. We determine the pseudogap
temperature $T^*$ where the dip structure in DOS vanishes. The value of $T^*$
is shown to be very different from another characteristic temperature $T^{**}$
where a BCS-type double peak structure disappears in the spectral weight. While
one finds $T^*>T^{**}$ in the BCS regime, $T^{**}$ becomes higher than $T^*$ in
the crossover region and BEC regime. Including this, we determine the pseudogap
region in the phase diagram of ultracold Fermi gases. Our results would be
useful in the search for the pseudogap region in ultracold $^6$Li and $^{40}$K
Fermi gases.

arbitrarily large. We emphasize that the 'nucleus' must possess Nc^2 degrees of
freedom per unit volume, so like a finite-temperature plasma, in order for a
supergravity description to exist. We critically reassess previous proposals
for introducing transverse inhomogeneity in the shockwave and formulate a new
proposal in that sense, which involves no external source but requires the
introduction of an 'infrared' cutoff which mimics confinement. This cutoff
however plays no role when the shockwave is probed by a highly virtual
projectile, so like in deep inelastic scattering. We consider two such
projectiles, the dilaton and the R-current, and compute the respective
structure functions including unitarity corrections. We find that there are no
leading-twist contributions to the structure functions at high virtuality,
meaning that there are no point-like constituents in the strongly coupled
'nucleus'. In the black-disk regime at low virtuality, the structure functions
are suggestive of parton saturation with occupation numbers of order one. The
saturation momentum Qs grows with the energy like Qs^2 ~ 1/x (with x the
Bjorken variable), which is the hallmark of graviton exchanges and is also
necessary for the fulfillment of the energy-momentum sum rules.

flare was detected in March 1979, suggesting the existence of magnetars, i.e.
neutron stars powered by the decay of their extremely strong magnetic field.
Since then, very little information has been obtained on this object, mainly
because it has been burst-inactive since 1983 and the study of its persistent
X-ray emission has been hampered by its large distance and its location in a
X-ray bright supernova remnant in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Here we report on
a comprehensive analysis of all the available XMM-Newton observations of SGR
0526-66. In particular, thanks to a deep observation taken in 2007, we measured
its pulsation period (P = 8.0544 +/- 0.0002 s) 6 years after its latest
detection by Chandra. This allowed us to detect for the first time a
significant reduction of its spin-down rate. From a comparison with two shorter
XMM-Newton observations performed in 2000 and 2001, we found no significant
changes in the spectrum, which is well modelled by an absorbed power-law with
nH = 4.6E+21 cm^-2 and photon index = 3.27. The high luminosity (about 4E+35
erg/s, in the 1-10 keV energy band) still observed about 25 years after the
latest detection of bursting activity places SGR 0526-66 in the group of bright
and persistent magnetar candidates.

equilibrium temperature is naturally defined, and it can be consistently
extended as a local temperature when far from equilibrium. This holds for
homogeneous as well as for disordered systems. In particular, we will consider
a system characterized by ferromagnetic random couplings $J_{ij} \in [ 1 -

and that heat transport can be described on the average by means of a Fourier

especially appreciable for low temperatures. We finally discuss a possible
singular behaviour arising for small disorder, i.e. in the limit $\epsilon \to

Unless the Hubble scale H is significantly below the gaugino condensation

zero which in turn leads to dilaton/moduli destabilization. In practice, this
often occurs at the Hubble rate about an order of magnitude below the gaugino

stabilization and thus places model independent constraints on inflationary

This is equivalent to computing the action of a certain matrix function on the
vector representing the initial condition. The matrix function is a linear
combination of the matrix exponential and other functions related to the
exponential (the so-called phi-functions). Such computations are the major
computational burden in the implementation of exponential integrators, which
can solve general ODEs. Our approach is to compute the action of the matrix
function by constructing a Krylov subspace using Arnoldi or Lanczos iteration
and projecting the function on this subspace. This is combined with
time-stepping to prevent the Krylov subspace from growing too large. The
algorithm is fully adaptive: it varies both the size of the time steps and the
dimension of the Krylov subspace to reach the required accuracy. We implement
this algorithm in the Matlab function phipm and we give instructions on how to
obtain and use this function. Various numerical experiments show that the phipm
function is often significantly more efficient than the state-of-the-art.

near-infrared surface brightness and the reliability of dust temperature
determination. Relative to visual extinction, the estimated emissivity at 870um
is kappa(870) = (1.3 +- 0.4) x 10^{-5} 1/mag. This is similar to the values
found in diffuse medium. A significant increase in the sub-millimetre
emissivity seems to be excluded. In spite of saturation, NIR surface brightness
was able to accurately pinpoint, and better than measurements of the colour
excesses of background stars, the exact location of the column density maximum.

second picosecond laser pulse to probe the positive trion transition, where a

  Aims. We therefore performed a detailed kinematic analysis of the neutral and
ionised gas components in the nearby star-forming irregular dwarf galaxy NGC
4861. Similar to a recently published study of NGC 2366, we want to make
predictions about the fate of the gas and to discuss some general issues about
this galaxy.
  Methods. Fabry-Perot interferometric data centred on the Halpha line were
obtained with the 1.93m telescope at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence. They
were complemented by HI synthesis data from the VLA. We performed a Gaussian
decomposition of both the Halpha and the HI emission lines in order to search
for multiple components indicating outflowing gas. The expansion velocities of
the detected outflows were compared to the escape velocity of NGC 4861, which
was modelled with a pseudo-isothermal halo.
  Results. Both in Halpha and HI the galaxy shows several outflows, three
directly connected to the disc and probably forming the edges of a supergiant
shell, and one at kpc-distance from the disc. We measured velocity offsets of
20 to 30 km/s, which are low in comparison to the escape velocity of the galaxy
and therefore minimise the chance of a galactic wind.

meta-learning. The meta-learning is the process of combining outcomes of
individual learning procedures in order to determine the final decision with
higher accuracy than any single learning method. Our method is constructed from
an ensemble of interacting, learning agents, that acquire and process incoming
information using various types, or different versions of machine learning
algorithms. The abstract learning space, where all agents are located, is
constructed here using a fully connected model that couples all agents with
random strength values. The cellular automata network simulates the higher
level integration of information acquired from the independent learning trials.
The final classification of incoming input data is therefore defined as the
stationary state of the meta-learning system using simple majority rule, yet
the minority clusters that share opposite classification outcome can be
observed in the system. Therefore, the probability of selecting proper class
for a given input data, can be estimated even without the prior knowledge of
its affiliation. The fuzzy logic can be easily introduced into the system, even
if learning agents are build from simple binary classification machine learning
algorithms by calculating the percentage of agreeing agents.

antennas belong to nodes of a small scale wireless network. The transmit
waveforms could be uncorrelated, or correlated in order to achieve a desirable
beampattern. The concept of compressive sampling is employed at the receive
nodes in order to perform direction of arrival (DOA) estimation. According to
the theory of compressive sampling, a signal that is sparse in some domain can
be recovered based on far fewer samples than required by the Nyquist sampling
theorem. The DOAs of targets form a sparse vector in the angle space, and
therefore, compressive sampling can be applied for DOA estimation. The proposed
approach achieves the superior resolution of MIMO radar with far fewer samples
than other approaches. This is particularly useful in a distributed scenario,
in which the results at each receive node need to be transmitted to a fusion
center.

continuously attracted by every other value differing from it by less than 1,
with an intensity proportional to the difference.
  We prove convergence to a set of clusters, with the agents in each cluster
sharing a common value, and provide a lower bound on the distance between
clusters at a stable equilibrium, under a suitable notion of multi-agent system
stability.
  To better understand the behavior of the system for a large number of agents,
we introduce a variant involving a continuum of agents. We prove, under some
conditions, the existence of a solution to the system dynamics, convergence to
clusters, and a non-trivial lower bound on the distance between clusters.
Finally, we establish that the continuum model accurately represents the
asymptotic behavior of a system with a finite but large number of agents.

vacuum molecular beam epitaxy is reported for the first time. The nuclei of the
pyramidal and wedge-like clusters have been observed on the wetting layer
blocks and found to have different structures. The growth of the clusters of
both species goes on following different scenarios: Formation of the second
atomic layer of the wedge-like cluster results in rearrangement of its first
layer. Its ridge structure does not replicate the structure of the nucleus. The
pyramidal cluster grows without phase transitions. The structure of its vertex
copies the structure of the nucleus. The wedge-like clusters contain point
defects on the triangular faces and have preferential directions of growth
along the ridges.
  The derived structure of the {105} facet corresponds to the PD model. The
critical epinucleation phenomenon may be responsible for hut formation.

electron-like events observed by the MiniBooNE experiment, could be explained
by the radiative decay of a heavy sterile neutrino nu_h of the mass around 500
MeV with a muonic mixing strength in the range |U_{\mu h}|^2 \simeq (1-4)\times
10^{-3}. If such nu_h exists its admixtures in the decay Ds -> mu+nu would
result in the decay Ds -> mu+nu_h with the branching fraction \simeq
(1.2-5.5)\times 10^{-4}, which is in the experimentally accessible range.
Interestingly, the existence of the Ds -> mu+nu_h decay at this level may also
explain why the currently measured decay rate of Ds -> mu+nu is slightly higher
than the predicted one. This enhances motivation for a sensitive search for
this decay mode and makes it interesting and complementary to neutrino
experiments probing sterile-active neutrino mixing. Considering, as an example
the CLEO-c experiment, we suggest to perform a search for the decay Ds ->
mu+nu_h with the analysis of existing data. The discrepancy between the
measurements and theoretical description of the decay Ds -> tau+nu is also
discussed in brief.

pattern p over an alphabet Delta if there is no factor x of w and no

have recently applied an algebraic technique due to Golod to show that for a
certain wide class of patterns p there are exponentially many words of length n

their work. In particular, we show that any pattern with k variables of length

to the chiral critical surface, i.e. the surface of second order transitions
bounding the region of first order chiral phase transitions for small quark
masses in the {m_{u,d}, m_s,\mu} parameter space. For \mu=0, QCD with physical
quark masses is known to be an analytic crossover, requiring the region of
chiral transitions to expand with \mu for a critical endpoint to exist.
Instead, on coarse N_t=4 lattices, we find the area of chiral transitions to
shrink with \mu, which excludes a chiral critical point for QCD at moderate
chemical potentials \mu_B < 500 MeV. First results on finer N_t=6 lattices
indicate a curvature of the critical surface consistent with zero and unchanged
conclusions.

systems with local interactions that the entropy of a large region is
proportional to its surface area. In some cases, this area law is corrected
with a logarithmic factor. This contrasts with the fact that in almost all
states of the Hilbert space, the entropy of a region is proportional to its
volume. This paper shows that low-energy states have (at most) an area law with
the logarithmic correction, provided two conditions hold: (i) the state has
sufficient decay of correlations, (ii) the number of eigenstates with vanishing
energy-density is not exponential in the volume. These two conditions are
satisfied by many relevant systems. The central idea of the argument is that
energy fluctuations inside a region can be observed by measuring the exterior
and a superficial shell of the region.
