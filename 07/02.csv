Milky Way, concentrating on features regarding the dark matter halo component.
We have considered a variegated sample of dynamical observables for the Galaxy,
including several results which have appeared recently, and studied a 7- or
8-dimensional parameter space - defining the Galaxy model - by implementing a
Bayesian approach to the parameter estimation based on a Markov Chain Monte
Carlo method. The main result of this analysis is a novel determination of the
local dark matter halo density which, assuming spherical symmetry and either an
Einasto or an NFW density profile is found to be around 0.39 GeV cm$^{-3}$ with
a 1-$\sigma$ error bar of about 7%; more precisely we find a $\rho_{DM}(R_0) =
0.385 \pm 0.027 \rm GeV cm^{-3}$ for the Einasto profile and $\rho_{DM}(R_0) =
0.389 \pm 0.025 \rm GeV cm^{-3}$ for the NFW. This is in contrast to the
standard assumption that $\rho_{DM}(R_0)$ is about 0.3 GeV cm$^{-3}$ with an
uncertainty of a factor of 2 to 3. A very precise determination of the local
halo density is very important for interpreting direct dark matter detection
experiments. Indeed the results we produced, together with the recent accurate
determination of the local circular velocity, should be very useful to
considerably narrow astrophysical uncertainties on direct dark matter
detection.

of the right-handed neutrino with the top quark to leading order in the Yukawa

a factor of 1.5 in the weak wash-out regime (K<1), compared to the usual
integrated approach which assumes kinetic equilibrium and neglects quantum

previous studies that considered only decay and inverse decay of the
right-handed neutrino. However, this suppression quickly decreases as we
increase K. In the strong wash-out regime (K>1), the full Boltzmann treatment
and the integrated approach give nearly identical final lepton asymmetries

of quantum statistics on decays/inverse decays and the scattering processes

high Reynolds numbers. It is based on an ensemble of dipole vortex tubes taken
as quasi-particles and realized in form of rings, hairpins or filament couples
of potentially finite length. In a not necesserily planar cross sectional area
through a vortex tangle, taken locally orthogonal through each individual tube,
the dipoles are moving with the classical dipole velocity. The vortex radius is
directly related with Prandtl's classical mixing length. The quasi-particles
perform dipol chaos which reminds of molecular chaos in real gases. Collisions
between quasi-particles lead either to particle annihilation (turbulent
dissipation) or to particle scattering (turbulent diffusion). These ideas
suffice to develop a closed theory of shear-generated turbulence without
empirical parameters, with analogies to birth and death processes of
macromolecules. It coincides almost perfectly with the well-known K-Omega
turbulence closure applied in many branches of science and technology. In the
case of free homogeneous decay the TKE is shown to follow 1/t. For an adiabatic
condition at a solid wall the theory predicts a logarithmic mean-flow boundary
layer with von Karman's constant as 1/SQRT(2 pi)=0.399.

looking at how the arrangement of charge over the aggregate surface or the

shown that these dipole-dipole interactions can affect the orientation and
structural formation of aggregates as they collide and stick. Analysis of the

optical images, from which they inferred a self-obscured object with a mass of
about 10 Msun. We obtained Spitzer observations of SN 2008S five days after its
discovery, as well as coordinated Gemini and Spitzer optical and infrared
observations six months after its outburst.
  We have constructed radiative transfer dust models for the object before and
after the outburst, using the same r^-2 density distribution of pre-existing
amorphous carbon grains for all epochs and taking light-travel time effects
into account for the early post-outburst epoch. We rule out silicate grains as
a significant component of the dust around SN 2008S. The inner radius of the
dust shell moved outwards from its pre-outburst value of 85 AU to a
post-outburst value of 1250 AU, attributable to grain vaporisation by the light
flash from SN 2008S. Although this caused the circumstellar extinction to
decrease from Av = 15 before the outburst to 0.8 after the outburst, we
estimate that less than 2% of the overall circumstellar dust mass was
destroyed.
  The total mass-loss rate from the progenitor star is estimated to have been
(0.5-1.0)x10^-4 Msun yr^-1. The derived dust mass-loss rate of 5x10^-7 Msun
yr^-1 implies a total dust injection into the ISM of up to 0.01 Msun over the

on the relative importance of gravitational, turbulent, magnetic, and thermal

shows the importance of magnetic fields in the star formation process, even
when they are relatively weak (super-Alfvenic turbulence). In this
non-magnetized limit, our definition of the critical density for star formation
has the same dependence on alpha_vir, and almost the same dependence on M_S,0,
as in the model of Krumholz and McKee, although our physical derivation does
not rely on the concepts of local turbulent pressure and sonic scale. However,
our model predicts a different dependence of the SFR on alpha_vir and M_S,0
than the model of Krumholz and McKee. The star-formation simulations used to
test the model result in an approximately constant SFR, after an initial
transient phase. Both the value of the SFR and its dependence on the virial
parameter found in the simulations are shown to agree very well with the
theoretical predictions.

Firstly, properties of the packet success probability curve as a function of

identified. That is, for any given strategies of competitors of a node, there
exists a critical node-sink separation for this node such that its
best-response is to transmit when its distance to the sink node is smaller than
this critical threshold, and to back off otherwise. Finally, necessary and

strong features visible in even low- to medium-resolution spectra, yielding
results comparable to much more telescope-intensive high-resolution studies. We
validate this method by comparison with 913 stars which have existing
high-resolution and low- to medium-resolution to medium-resolution spectra, and
that cover a wide range of stellar parameters. We find that at low
metallicities ([Fe/H] < -2.0), we successfully recover both the metallicity and
carbon abundance, where possible, with an accuracy of ~ 0.20 dex. At higher
metallicities, due to issues of continuum placement in spectral normalization
done prior to the running of autoMOOG, a general underestimate of the overall
metallicity of a star is seen, although the carbon abundance is still
successfully recovered. As a result, this method is only recommended for use on
samples of stars of known sufficiently low metallicity. For these
low-metallicity stars, however, autoMOOG performs much more consistently and
quickly than similar, existing techniques, which should allow for analyses of
large samples of metal-poor stars in the near future. Steps to improve and
correct the continuum placement difficulties are being pursued.

of the Josephson current through the gate voltage tuned AC phase.

nonlinear bias factors from their bispectra. We find that on large scales down

an N-element set are \ell-colored, there is a monochromatic set of size n,
where a set is called monochromatic if all its k-tuples have the same color.
The logical negation of N \to (n)_{\ell}^k is written as N \not \to
(n)_{\ell}^k. An ingenious construction of Erd\H{o}s and Hajnal known as the
stepping-up lemma gives a negative partition relation for higher uniformity
from one of lower uniformity, effectively gaining an exponential in each
application. Namely, if \ell \geq 2, k \geq 3, and N \not \to (n)_{\ell}^k,
then 2^N \not \to (2n+k-4)_{\ell}^{k+1}. In this note we give an improved
construction for k \geq 4. We introduce a general class of colorings which
extends the framework of Erd\H{o}s and Hajnal and can be used to establish
negative partition relations. We show that if \ell \geq 2, k \geq 4 and N \not

\ell \geq 3, then we get the better bound 2^N \not \to (n+2)_{\ell}^{k+1}. This
improved bound gives a coloring of the k-tuples whose largest monochromatic set
is a factor \Omega(2^{k}) smaller than given by the original version of the
stepping-up lemma. We give several applications of our result to lower bounds
on hypergraph Ramsey numbers. In particular, for fixed \ell \geq 4 we determine
up to an absolute constant factor (which is independent of k) the size of the
largest guaranteed monochromatic set in an \ell-coloring of the k-tuples of an

previously observed X-ray emission from the same stars. However, unlike the
coronal emission, the chromospheric emission of the stars show little evidence
of a reduction in emission (i.e. supersaturation) for the ultra-rapid rotators

typical-case complexity of combinatorial optimization. Recent theoretical and
simulation work revealed that the solution space of a random $K$-SAT formula
has very rich structures, including the emergence of solution communities
within single solution clusters. In this paper we investigate the influence of
the solution space landscape to a simple stochastic local search process {\tt
SEQSAT}, which satisfies a $K$-SAT formula in a sequential manner. Before
satisfying each newly added clause, {\tt SEQSAT} walk randomly by single-spin
flips in a solution cluster of the old subformula. This search process is
efficient when the constraint density $\alpha$ of the satisfied subformula is
less than certain value $\alpha_{cm}$; however it slows down considerably as
$\alpha > \alpha_{cm}$ and finally reaches a jammed state at $\alpha \approx
\alpha_{j}$. The glassy dynamical behavior of {\tt SEQSAT} for $\alpha \geq
\alpha_{cm}$ probably is due to the entropic trapping of various communities in
the solution cluster of the satisfied subformula. For random 3-SAT, the jamming
transition point $\alpha_j$ is larger than the solution space clustering
transition point $\alpha_d$, and its value can be predicted by a long-range
frustration mean-field theory. For random $K$-SAT with $K\geq 4$, however, our
simulation results indicate that $\alpha_j = \alpha_d$. The relevance of this
work for understanding the dynamic properties of glassy systems is also
discussed.

we measure the drag force exerted on a wire moving in the bulk. We show that
when the driving vibration energy is increased, the effective rheology changes
drastically: going from a non-linear dynamical friction behavior - weakly
increasing with the velocity- up to a linear force-velocity regime. We present
a simple heuristic model to account for the vanishing of the stress dynamical
threshold at a finite vibration intensity and the onset of a linear
force-velocity behavior. Second, we measure the drag force on spherical
intruders when the dragging velocity, the vibration energy, and the diameters
are varied. We evidence a so-called ''geometrical hardening'' effect for
smaller size intruders and a logarithmic hardening effect for the velocity

Although such systems can be made extensive, they are intrinsically non

at the origin of ensemble inequivalence, which implies that specific heat can

that ergodicity may be generically broken. We present here a comprehensive

of the review consists in the detailed presentation of the concept of ensemble
inequivalence, as exemplified by the exact solution, in the microcanonical and

thermodynamic equilibrium can be extremely slow and quasi-stationary states may
be present. The understanding of such unusual relaxation process is obtained by
the introduction of an appropriate kinetic theory based on the Vlasov equation.

dynamics of a baby skyrmion configuration, in a model Landau-Lifshitz equation,
was studied in the presence of various potential obstructions. The baby
skyrmion configuration was constructed from two Q=1 hedgehog solutions to the
new baby Skyrme model in $(2+1)$ dimensions.
  The potential obstructions were created by introducing a new term into the
Lagrangian which resulted in a localised inhomogeneity in the potential term's
coefficient. In the barrier system the normal circular path was deformed as the
skyrmions traversed the barrier, after which the skyrmions orbited the boundary
of the system. For critical values of the barrier height and width the
skyrmions were no longer bound although the unbound behaviour is not clearly
distinct from the bound. In the case of a potential hole the dynamics of baby
skyrmions is dependent upon the binding energy of the system. Depending upon
its value, the skyrmions' behaviour varies. The angular momentum must be
modified to ensure overall conservation. We show that there exists a link
between the oscillation in the skyrmion's energy density and the periods of
non-conservation of the angular momentum in Landau-Lifshitz models.

research in optimization, evolution, and complex systems science. Many
researchers have thus recognized the importance of evolvability, i.e. the
ability to find new variants of higher fitness, in the fields of biological
evolution and evolutionary computation. Recent studies by Ciliberti et al
(Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., 2007) and Wagner (Proc. R. Soc. B., 2008) propose a
potentially important link between the robustness and the evolvability of a

to the emergence of evolvability. Here we study two design principles,
redundancy and degeneracy, for achieving robustness and we show that they have
a dramatically different impact on the evolvability of the system. In
particular, purely redundant systems are found to have very little evolvability
while systems with degeneracy, i.e. distributed robustness, can be orders of
magnitude more evolvable. These results offer insights into the general
principles for achieving evolvability and may prove to be an important step
forward in the pursuit of evolvable representations in evolutionary
computation.

coevolution can occur in evolutionary algorithms when only a few conditions are

(linear) ranking allow for a form of coevolutionary dynamics that is observed
when 1) changes are made in what solutions are able to interact during the
ranking process and 2) evolution takes place in a multi-objective environment.
This research contributes to the study of simulated evolution in a at least two
ways. First, it establishes a broader relationship between coevolution and
multi-objective optimization than has been previously considered in the
literature. Second, it demonstrates that the preconditions for coevolutionary
behavior are weaker than previously thought. In particular, our model indicates
that direct cooperation or competition between species is not required for
coevolution to take place. Moreover, our experiments provide evidence that
environmental perturbations can drive coevolutionary processes; a conclusion
that mirrors arguments put forth in dual phase evolution theory. In the
discussion, we briefly consider how our results may shed light onto this and

interest with prominent examples found in defense and security. Planning
provides a unique context for optimization that has not been explored in great
detail and involves a number of interesting challenges which are distinct from
traditional optimization research. Planning problems demand solutions that can
satisfy a number of competing objectives on multiple scales related to
robustness, adaptiveness, risk, etc. The scenario method is a key approach for
planning. Scenarios can be defined for long-term as well as short-term plans.
This paper introduces computational scenario-based planning problems and
proposes ways to accommodate strategic positioning within the tactical planning
domain. We demonstrate the methodology in a resource planning problem that is
solved with a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. Our discussion and
results highlight the fact that scenario-based planning is naturally framed
within a multi-objective setting. However, the conflicting objectives occur on
different system levels rather than within a single system alone. This paper
also contends that planning problems are of vital interest in many human
endeavors and that Evolutionary Computation may be well positioned for this
problem domain.

galaxy diminishes the chances of establishing contact with an extraterrestrial
technological civilization (ETC) within a certain time window. This argument is
tackled in this work in the context of exploration probes, whose propagation
can be faster than that of a colonization wavefront. Extensive computational
simulations have been done to build a numerical model of the dynamics of the
exploration. A probabilistic analysis is subsequently conducted in order to
obtain bounds on the number of ETCs that may be exploring the galaxy without
establishing contact with Earth, depending on factors such as the number of
probes they use, their lifetime and whether they leave some long-term imprint
on explored systems or not. The results indicate that it is unlikely that more
than ~10^2-10^3 ETCs are exploring the galaxy in a given Myr, if their probes
have a lifetime of 50 Myr and contact evidence lasts for 1 Myr. This bound goes
down to ~10 if contact evidence lasts for 100 Myr, and is also shown to be
inversely proportional to the lifetime of probes. These results are interpreted
in light of the Fermi paradox and are compatible with non-stationary
astrobiological models in which a few ETCs have gradually appeared in the

postulated on the basis of the idea of identity of space-time and physical
vacuum. An attempt is made to define space-time not via the concept of
manifold, but via the store of physical functions defined on it. The new
description is based on the commutator representation of the causal structure
of operator field theory. It is not the world point, but a universal field
supermatrix complex U that is assumed to be the carrier of possible local
events. This complex involves a complete set of Heisenberg local field
operators together with their spin-group bases in the Fermi-field
representation. The fundamental element of the extension is described in the
model by the equation of a special commutator algebra closed on two such local
complexes U_1 and U_2 ""nearest"" in the two-sided light-like connection and
linked by a single virtual field interaction vertex. The discrete character of
the constructed ""quantum proximity"" equation containing the gravitational
constant is associated with the existence of local curvature on the Planck
scale. Algebraic closed-ness of the basic equation suggests that the charge
symmetry group should be group E_6 with non-standard representations of the
fermion and scalar fields. On the basis of the calculated U expression we
propose an effective superinvariant Lagrangian with fixed coefficients on the
near-Planck scale, from which one can in principle try to obtain a low-energy
limit for comparison with the real world.

the corresponding effective Hamiltonian below a certain energy coincide up to
errors of order $\varepsilon^3$ with those of the full Hamiltonian under
reasonable conditions.
  Our results hold in the situation where tangential and normal energies are of
the same order, and where exchange between these energies occurs. In earlier
results tangential energies were assumed to be small compared to normal
energies, and rather restrictive assumptions were needed, to ensure that the
separation of energies is maintained during the time evolution. Most
importantly, we can allow for constraining potentials that change their shape
along the submanifold, which is the typical situation in the applications to
quantum wave guides and to quantum molecular dynamics.
  In order to explain the meaning and the relevance of some of the terms in the

consistent with measurements of a tidal stream, taking into account the extent
that tidal streams do not precisely delineate orbits. We show that if accurate
line-of-sight velocities are measured along a well defined stream, the
technique recovers the underlying orbit through the Galaxy and predicts the
distances and proper motions along the stream to high precision. As the error
bars on the location and velocities of the stream grow, the technique is able
to find more and more orbits that are consistent with the data and the
uncertainties in the predicted distances and proper motions increase. With
radial-velocity data along a stream ~40deg long and <0.3deg wide on the sky
accurate to ~1 km/s the precisions of the distances and tangential velocities
along the stream are 4 percent and 5 km/s, respectively. The technique can be
used to diagnose the Galactic potential: if circular-speed curve is actually
flat, both a Keplerian potential and Phi(r) proportional to r are readily
excluded. Given the correct radial density profile for the dark halo, the
halo's mass can be determined to a precision of 5 percent.

generalized by Ferus, Karcher and M\""unzner to many more examples via the
Clifford representations; we will refer to these examples of Ozeki and Takeuchi

systems \cite{DN1}, which are algebraic in nature, to prove that Condition A
alone implies the isoparametric hypersurface is of OT-FKM type. Their proof for
the case of multiplicity pairs $\{3,4\}$ and $\{7,8\}$ rests on a fairly
involved algebraic classification result \cite{Mc} about composition triples.
  In light of the classification \cite{CCJ} that leaves only the four
exceptional multiplicity pairs $\{4,5\},\{3,4\},\{7,8\}$ and $\{6,9\}$
unsettled, it appears that Condition A may hold the key to the classification

deserves to be scrutinized and understood more thoroughly from different

techniques. We explain how to correctly extract the full $O(a^2)$ dependence;
in fact, our method is generalizable to any order in $a$.
  The $O(a^2)$ corrections to the quark propagator and Green's functions
computed in this paper are useful to improve the nonperturbative RI-MOM
determination of renormalization constants for quark bilinear operators.
  Our results depend on a large number of parameters: coupling constant, number
of colors, lattice spacing, external momentum, clover parameter, Symanzik
coefficients, gauge parameter. To make these results most easily accessible to
the reader, we have included them in the distribution package of this paper, as

long perturbation waves in a plane incompressible wake. The analysis is posed
as an initial-value problem in space. More specifically, input is made at an
initial location in the downstream direction and then tracing the resulting
behavior further downstream subject to the restriction of finite kinetic
energy. This presentation follows the outline given by Criminale and Drazin
[Stud. in Applied Math. \textbf{83}, 123 (1990)] that describes the system in
terms of perturbation vorticity and velocity. The analysis is based on large
scale waves and expansions using multi scales and multi times for the partial
differential equations. The multiscaling is based on an approach where the
small parameter is linked to the perturbation property independently from the
flow control parameter. Solutions of the perturbative equations are determined
numerically after the introduction of a regular perturbation scheme
analytically deduced up to the second order. Numerically, the complete linear
system is also integrated. Since the results relevant to the complete problem
are in very good agreement with the results of the first order analysis, the
numerical solution at the second order was deemed not necessary. The use for an
arbitrary initial-value problem will be shown to contain a wealth of
information for the different transient behaviors associated to the symmetry,
angle of obliquity and spatial decay of the long waves. The amplification
factor of transversal perturbations never presents the trend - a growth
followed by a long damping - usually seen in waves with wavenumber of order one
or less. Asymptotical instability is always observed.

an atomic or electronic shell effect. We have also found that at room
temperature, contacts of the diameter of a single atom are absent. A possible
interpretation could be the occurrence of a metal-to-insulator transition as
the contact radius is reduced, in analogy with what it is known in the context
of Mg clusters. However, our first principle calculations show that while an
infinite linear chain can be insulating, Mg wires with larger atomic
coordinations, as in realistic atomic contacts, are alwaysmetallic. Finally, at
liquid helium temperature our measurements show that the conductance histogram
is dominated by a pronounced peak at the quantum of conductance. This is in
good agreement with our calculations based on a tight-binding model that
indicate that the conductance of a Mg one-atom contact is dominated by a single

monotonicity conditions along rows and diagonals. Their significance is mainly
due to the fact that they correspond to $n \times n$ alternating sign matrices
when prescribing $(1,2,...,n)$ as bottom row of the array. We define monotone
$(d,m)$--trapezoids as monotone triangles with $m$ rows where the $d-1$ top
rows are removed. (These objects are also equivalent to certain partial
alternating sign matrices.) It is known that the number of monotone triangles
with bottom row $(k_1,...,k_n)$ is given by a polynomial
$\alpha(n;k_1,...,k_n)$ in the $k_i$'s. The main purpose of this paper is to
show that the number of monotone $(d,m)$--trapezoids with prescribed top and
bottom row appears as a coefficient in the expansion of a specialization of
$\alpha(n;k_1,...,k_n)$ with respect to a certain polynomial basis. This
settles a generalization of a recent conjecture of Romik and the author. Among
other things, the result is used to express the number of monotone triangles
with bottom row $(1,2,...,i-1,i+1,...,j-1,j+1,...,n)$ (which is, by the
standard bijection, also the number of $n \times n$ alternating sign matrices
with given top two rows) in terms of the number of $n \times n$ alternating
sign matrices with prescribed top and bottom row, and, by a formula of
Stroganov for the latter numbers, to provide an explicit formula for the first
numbers. (A formula of this type was first derived by Karklinsky and Romik

obscured Radio Galaxies (RG) exhibits signatures of photoionised gas (e.g. 3C
445 and 3C 33) similar to those observed in radio-quiet obscured Active
Galactic Nuclei (AGN). While signatures of warm absorbing gas covering a wide
range of temperature and ionisation states have been detected in about one half
of the population of nearby Seyfert 1 galaxies, no traces of warm absorber gas
have been reported to date in the high-resolution spectra of Broad Line Radio
Galaxies (BLRG). We present here the first detection of a soft X-ray warm
absorber in the powerful FRII BLRG 3C 382 using the Reflection Grating
Spectrometer (RGS) on-board XMM-Newton. The absorption gas appears to be highly
ionised, with column density of the order of 10^{22} cm^{-2}, ionisation
parameter log\xi>2 erg cm s^{-1} and outflow velocities of the order of 10^{3}
km s^{-1}. The absorption lines may come from regions located outside the
torus, however at distances less than 60 pc. This result may indicate that a
plasma ejected at velocities near the speed of light and a photoionised gas
with slower, outflow velocities can coexist in the same source beyond the Broad
Line Regions.

eV. We show that under these conditions, electron-electron scatterings, as the
photoelectrons leave the metal give rise to a tail of secondary electrons with
lower energies and hence a significant background. We develop an analytical
model based on an approximate solution to Boltzmann's transport equation, to
account for the amount and energy distribution of these secondary electrons.
Our theory is in good agreement with the electron spectrum found in a recent
attosecond streaking experiment. To suppress the background and gain higher
energy resolution, photon sources of higher energy could be advantageous.

accurately described by a geodesic. However, there should be ``gravitational

importance to be able to calculate these self-force corrections in order to be
able to determine such effects as inspiral motion in the extreme mass ratio

equation which governs orientational relaxation of an equilibrium molecular
ensemble in the hindered rotation limit and in the long time limit. The
generalized diffusion equation is an extension of the small-angle diffusion
