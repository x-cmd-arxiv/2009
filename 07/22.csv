the hypothesis of magnetically mediated Cooper pairing. However, since most
theories of superconductivity are based on a pairing boson of sufficient
spectral weight in the normal state, detailed knowledge of the spin excitation
spectrum above the superconducting transition temperature Tc is required to
assess the viability of this hypothesis. Using inelastic neutron scattering we
have studied the spin excitations in optimally doped BaFe1.85Co0.15As2 (Tc = 25
K) over a wide range of temperatures and energies. We present the results in
absolute units and find that the normal state spectrum carries a weight
comparable to underdoped cuprates. In contrast to cuprates, however, the
spectrum agrees well with predictions of the theory of nearly antiferromagnetic
metals, without complications arising from a pseudogap or competing
incommensurate spin-modulated phases. We also show that the temperature
evolution of the resonance energy follows the superconducting energy gap, as
expected from conventional Fermi-liquid approaches. Our observations point to a
surprisingly simple theoretical description of the spin dynamics in the iron
arsenides and provide a solid foundation for models of magnetically mediated
superconductivity.

crystallized to different degrees heating from the amorphous state. Even when
primary crystallization has been completed, secondary crystallization can take
place with further annealing and modify the characteristics of the amorphous
interlamellar phase. In this work we study the glass transition of highly
crystallized PET and in which way it is modified by secondary crystallization.
Amorphous PET samples were annealed for 4 hours at temperatures between 140C
and 180C. The secondary crystallization process was monitored by differential
scanning calorimetry and the glass transition of the remaining interllamelar
amorphous phase was studied by Thermally Stimulated Depolarization Currents
measurements. Non--isothermal window polarization is employed to resolve the
relaxation in modes with a well--defined relaxation time that are subsequently
adjusted to several standard models. Analysis of experimental results, show
that cooperativity is reduced to a great extend in the interlamellar amorphous
regions. The evolution of the modes on crystallization temperature reveals that
large scale movements are progressively replaced by more localized ones, with
higher frequency, as crystallization takes place at higher temperatures. As a
consequence, the glass transition temperature of the amorphous interlamellar
phase tends to lower values for higher annealing temperatures. Evolution of
calorimetric scans of the glass transition are simulated from the obtained
results and show the same behaviour. The interpretation of these results in
terms of current views about secondary crystallization is discussed.

results for a class of stochastic integrate and fire oscillators (SIFs) in
which the buildup of membrane potential in the neuron is governed by a Gaussian
diffusion process. To analyze this model, we study the asymptotic behavior of
the spectrum of the firing phase transition operator. We begin by proving
strong versions of a law of large numbers and central limit theorem for the
first passage-time of the underlying diffusion process across a general time

the transition operator's eigenvalues. We also discuss connections between our
results and earlier numerical investigations of SIFs.

scattering spectra is generally done by fitting a model to the data by means of
chi-square minimization procedure. However, as pointed out by the pioneering
work of D.S. Sivia et al., also another probabilistic approach based on Bayes
theorem can be employed. In a nutshell, the main difference between the
classical chi-square minimization and the Bayesian approach is the way of
expressing the final results: In the first case, the result is a set of values
of parameters with a symmetric error and a figure of merit such as chi-square,
whereas in the second case the results are presented as probability
distribution functions (PDF) of both, parameters and merit figure. In this
contribution, we demonstrate how final PDFs are obtained by exploring all
possible combinations of parameters that are compatible with the experimental
error. Three advantages of this method will be emphasized: First, correlations
between parameters are automatically taken into account, which implies, for
example, that parameter errors are correctly calculated, correlations show up
in a natural way and ill defined parameters are immediately recognized from
their PDF. Second, it is possible to calculate the likelihood of a determined
physical model, and therefore to select the one among many that fits the data
best with a minimal number of parameters, in a correctly defined probabilistic
way.

from which the gas has been removed by interactions with hot cluster gas, or by
ram-pressure stripping of cool gas from spirals that are orbiting within rich
clusters of galaxies. However, problems with this interpretation are that: (1)
Some lenticulars, such as NGC 3115, are isolated field galaxies rather than
cluster members. (2) The distribution of flattening values of S0 galaxies in
clusters, in groups and in the field are statistically indistinguishable. This
is surprising because one might have expected most of the progenitors of field
S0 galaxies to have been flattened late-type galaxies, whereas lenticulars in
clusters are thought to have mostly been derived from bulge-dominated
early-type galaxies. (3) It should be hardest for ram-pressure to strip massive
luminous galaxies with deep potential wells. However, no statistically
significant differences are seen between the luminosity distributions of
early-type Shapley-Ames galaxies in clusters, groups and in the field. (4)
Finally, both ram-pressure stripping and evaporation by hot intra-cluster gas
would be most efficient in rich clusters. However, the small number of
available data in the Shapley-Ames sample appears to show no statistically
significant differences between the relative frequencies of dust-poor S0_1 and
dust-rich S0_3 galaxies in clusters, groups and in the field. It is tentatively
concluded that ram-pressure stripping, and heating by intra-cluster gas, may
not be the only evolutionary channels that lead to the formation of lenticular
galaxies. It is speculated that gas starvation, or gas ejection by active
nuclei, may have play a major role in the formation of a significant fraction
of all S0 galaxies.

[Phys. Rev. Lett. 69, 1209 (1992)]. In particular, the bending rigidity is
found to harden algebraically in the long wavelength limit with an exponent
eta=0.789..., which is used to extract the elasticity softening exponent
eta_u=0.422..., and the roughness exponent zeta=0.605.... The scaling relation
eta_u=2-2eta is proven to hold to all orders in SCSA. Further, applying the
SCSA to an expansion in 1/d_C, is found to be essential, as no solution to the
self-consistent equations is found in a two bubble level, which is the naive
second order expansion. Surprisingly, even though the expansion parameter for
physical membrane is 1/d_C=1, the SCSA applied to second order expansion
deviates only slightly from the first order, increasing zeta by mere 0.016.
This supports the high quality of the SCSA for physical crystalline membranes,

these systems. The prediction of SCSA applied to first order expansion for the

models. We compare our numerical data with general expectations about the
thermal behavior of the deconfined gluon plasma and with various theoretical
descriptions, including, in particular, the improved holographic QCD model
recently proposed by Kiritsis and collaborators. We also comment on the
relevance of an AdS/CFT description for the QCD plasma in a phenomenologically
interesting temperature range where the system, while still strongly-coupled,
approaches a `quasi-conformal' regime characterized by approximate scale
invariance. Finally, we perform an extrapolation of our results to the N to
$\infty$ limit.

momentum $J_a=0$ and $J_b=1$ are forbidden when the photons are of the same

physics that forbids decays of vector particle into two photons. It arises
because it is impossible to construct a total angular momentum $J_{2\gamma}=1$
quantum-mechanical state of two photons that is permutation symmetric, as
required by Bose-Einstein statistics. In atoms with non-zero nuclear spin, the
selection rule can be violated due to hyperfine interactions. Two distinct

identified, and the hyperfine structure of the induced transitions is
evaluated. The selection rule is also relaxed, even for zero-nuclear-spin

similar mechanisms at play: Zeeman splitting of the intermediate-state

Yet, the average enhancement in star formation rate (SFR) in major mergers and
the contribution of such events to the cosmic SFR are not well estimated. Here
we use photometric redshifts, stellar masses and UV SFRs from COMBO-17, 24
micron SFRs from Spitzer and morphologies from two deep HST cosmological survey
fields (ECDFS/GEMS and A901/STAGES) to study the enhancement in SFR as a
function of projected galaxy separation. We apply two-point projected
correlation function techniques, which we augment with morphologically-selected
very close pairs (separation <2 arcsec) and merger remnants from the HST
imaging. Our analysis confirms that the most intensely star-forming systems are
indeed interacting or merging. Yet, for massive (M* > 10^10 Msun) star-forming
galaxies at 0.4<z<0.8, we find that the SFRs of galaxies undergoing a major
interaction (mass ratios <1:4 and separations < 40 kpc) are only 1.80 +/- 0.30
times higher than the SFRs of non-interacting galaxies when averaged over all
interactions and all stages of the interaction, in good agreement with other
observational works.
  We demonstrate that these results imply that <10% of star formation at 0.4 <
z < 0.8 is triggered directly by major mergers and interactions; these events
are not important factors in the build-up of stellar mass since z=1.

(BH) with a misaligned accretion disc to study BH spin precession and alignment
jointly with BH mass and spin parameter evolution, under the assumption that
the disc is continually fed, in its outer region, by matter with angular
momentum fixed on a given direction. We develop an iterative scheme based on
the adiabatic approximation to study the BH-disc coevolution: in this approach,
the accretion disc transits through a sequence of quasi-steady warped states
(Bardeen-Petterson effect) and interacts with the BH until the BH spin aligns
with the outer angular momentum direction. For a BH aligning with a co-rotating
disc, the fractional increase in mass is typically less than a few percent,
while the spin modulus can increase up to a few tens of percent. The alignment
timescale is between ~ 100 thousands and ~ 1 millions years for a maximally
rotating BH accreting at the Eddington rate. BH-disc alignment from an
initially counter-rotating disc tends to be more efficient compared to the
specular co-rotating case due to the asymmetry seeded in the Kerr metric:
counter-rotating matter carries a larger and opposite angular momentum when
crossing the innermost stable orbit, so that the spin modulus decreases faster
and so the relative inclination angle.

at GEMINI North telescope using the NIFS IFU in the K band. The purpose of
these observations, together with previously obtained observations with the
SAURON IFU, is to determine the masses (Mbh) of the supermassive black holes
(SMBH). The targeted galaxies were chosen to have central light profiles
showing a core (NGC524) and a cusp (NGC2549), to probe the feasibility of using
the galaxy centre as the NGS required for LGS AO. We employ an innovative `open
loop' technique. The data have spatial resolution of 0.23"" and 0.17"" FWHM,
showing that high quality LGS AO observations of these objects are possible. We
construct axisymmetric three-integral dynamical models which are constrained
with both the NIFS and SAURON data. The best fitting models yield Mbh=(8.3 +2.7
-1.3) x 10^8 Msun for NGC524 and Mbh=(1.4 +0.2 -1.3) x 10^7 Msun for NGC2549
(all errors are at the 3 sigma CL). We demonstrate that the wide-field SAURON
data play a crucial role in the M/L determination increasing the accuracy of
M/L by a factor of at least 5, and constraining the upper limits on Mbh. The
NIFS data are crucial in constraining the lower limits of Mbh and in
combination with the large scale data reducing the uncertainty by a factor of 2
or more. We find that the orbital structure of NGC524 shows significant
tangential anisotropy, while at larger radii both galaxies are consistent with
having almost perfectly oblate velocity ellipsoids. Tangential anisotropy in
NGC524 coincides with the size of SMBH sphere of influence and the core region
in the light profile. We test the accuracy to which Mbh can be measured using
seeings obtained from typical LGS AO observations, and conclude that for a
typical conditions and Mbh the expected uncertainty is of the order of 50%.

constructing essential sub-networks based on the strength of the pairwise
interactions, we are able to deduce the features of sequences redundant for
folding events. We perform an analysis on 48 two-state proteins and the

mass at fixed observable is $\sim$ 40%, depending on the aperture, sample and
observable considered. For example, for the massive CIRS systems
$\sigma_{lnM500|N500}$ = 0.33 $\pm$ 0.05 and $\sigma_{lnM500|Lx}$ = 0.48 $\pm$
0.06. For the full sample $\sigma_{lnM500|N500}$ = 0.43 $\pm$ 0.03 and

three dimensional optical data, verifying that substructure has no significant
effect on the cluster scaling relations (intercepts and slopes), independent of
which substructure test we use. For a subset of twenty-one clusters, we
estimate masses from the M-T$_X$ relation using temperature measures from BAX.
The scaling relations derived from the optical and X-ray masses are indeed very
similar, indicating that our method consistently estimates the cluster mass and
yields equivalent results regardless of the wavelength from which we measure
mass. For massive systems, we represent the mass-richness relation by a
function with the form ${\rm ln (M_{200}) = A + B \times ln(N_{200}/60)}$, with
M$_{200}$ being expressed in units of 10$^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$. Using the virial

the end of operations for the Gaia/ESA mission. This is a new situation which
enables long term astrometric projects that could not be achieved by either
mission alone. Using the well-known perspective acceleration effect on
astrometric measurements, the true heliocentric radial velocity of a nearby
star can be measured with great precision if the time baseline of the
astrometric measurements is long enough. Since white dwarfs are compact
objects, the gravitational redshift can be quite large (40-80 km/s), and is the
predominant source of any shift in wavelength. The mismatch of the true radial
velocity with the spectroscopic shift thus leads to a direct measure of the
Mass--Radius relation for such objects. Using available catalog information
about the known nearby white dwarfs, we estimate how many masses/gravitational
redshift measurements can be obtained with an accuracy better than 2%. Nearby
white dwarfs are relatively faint objects (10 < V < 15), which can be easily
observed by both missions. We also briefly discuss how the presence of a long
period planet can mask the astrometric signal of perspective acceleration.

theory and stochastic dynamics simulations findings we have identified three
regimes of extensional deformation: (i) a linear response regime characterized
by a weakly elongated (ellipsoidal) shape of the globule at small deformations,
(ii) a tadpole structure with a globular ""head"" coexisting with a stretched
""tail"" at intermediate ranges of deformations, and (iii) an uniformly stretched
chain at strong extensions. The conformational transition from the tadpole to
the stretched chain is accompanied by an abrupt unfolding of the depleted
globular head and a corresponding jump-wise drop in the intrachain tension. The
unfolding-refolding cycle demonstrates a hysteresis loop in the vicinity of the
transition point. These three regimes of deformation, as well as the
first-order like transition between the tadpole and the stretched chain
conformations, can be experimentally observable provided that the number of
monomer units in the chain is large and/or the solvent quality is sufficiently
poor. For short chains, on the other hand, under moderately poor solvent
strength conditions, the unfolding transition is continuous. Upon an increase
in the imposed end-to-end distance the extended globule retains a
longitudinally uniform shape at any degree of deformation. In all cases the
system exhibits a negative extensional modulus in the intermediate range of
deformations. We anticipate that predicted patterns in force-deformation curves
for polymer molecules in poor solvent can be observed in single molecule atomic
spectroscopy experiments.

with increasing importance and brightness classes. The increase is more
pronounced for the duration and decay time. The same relation is valid with
regard to the brightness class. On the other hand for SXR flares, the duration,
rise and decay also increase with the flare class being more pronounced for the
duration and rise time. We have also analysed the event asymmetry (EA) of
H-alpha, SXR and HXR flares for the same period. The EA indices are
predominantly positive for H-alpha but for SXR and HXR this shows symmetrical
distribution on both sides of zero asymmetry. Our study also presents the
result of the Neupert effect (NE) in solar flares for the same period. We
investigate the time difference (\Delta t) between the maximum of SXR emission
and the end of the HXR emission for many flares during the period of our
investigation. Our study shows that distribution of the time difference reveals
a peak at . Out of 236 events, only 48 (20.34 per cent) events satisfy the NE
whereas there is also a significant fraction of flares 62 (26.27 per cent)
which shows strong deviation form . The period of investigation is focused on
the descending phase of solar cycle 23. Study of this period is significant
because in this decay phase activity exhibits a sudden increase.

near-IR photons by submillimeter emitting relativistic particles which follow
scaling relations obtained from size measurements of Sgr A*. We also find that
the flare statistics in near-IR wavelengths is consistent with the probability
of flare emission being inversely proportional to the flux. At millimeter
wavelengths, the presence of flare emission at 43 GHz (7mm) using VLBA with
milli-arcsecond spatial resolution indicates the first direct evidence that
hourly time scale flares are localized within the inner 30$\times$70
Schwarzschild radii of Sgr A*. We also show several cross correlation plots
between near-IR, millimeter and submillimeter light curves that collectively
demonstrate the presence of time delays between the peaks of emission up to
three hours. The evidence for time delays at millimeter and submillimeter
wavelengths are consistent with the source of emission being optically thick
initially followed by a transition to an optically thin regime. In particular,
there is an intriguing correlation between the optically thin near-IR and X-ray
flare and optically thick radio flare at 43 GHz that occurred on 2007 April 4.

from MgO-based magnetic tunnel junctions. The spin wave frequencies were
measured using spectrally resolved electrical noise measurements. In all
spectra, several independent quantized spin wave modes have been observed and
could be identified as eigenexcitations of the free layer and of the synthetic
antiferromagnet of the junction. Using a theoretical approach based on the
diagonalization of the dynamical matrix of a system of three coupled, spatially
confined magnetic layers, we have modeled the spectra for the smallest pillar
and have extracted its material parameters. The magnetization and exchange
stiffness constant of the CoFeB free layer are thereby found to be
substantially reduced compared to the corresponding thin film values. Moreover,
we could infer that the pinning of the magnetization at the lateral boundaries
must be weak. Finally, the interlayer dipolar coupling between the free layer
and the synthetic antiferromagnet causes mode anticrossings with gap openings
up to 2 GHz. At low fields and in the larger pillars, there is clear evidence
for strong non-uniformities of the layer magnetizations. In particular, at zero

distribution of the metals are studied using radial metallicity profiles and 2D
metallicity maps of the model clusters as they would be observed by X-ray
telescopes like XMM-Newton. Analytical approximations for the mass loss by
galactic winds driven by thermal and cosmic ray pressure are derived from the
Bernoulli equation and implemented in combined N-body/hydrodynamic cosmological
simulations with a semi-analytical galaxy formation model. Observable
quantities like the mean metallicity, metallicity profiles, and 2D metal maps
of the model clusters are derived from the simulations. We find that galactic
winds alone cannot account for the observed metallicity of the ICM. At redshift
$z=0$ the model clusters have metallicities originating from galactic winds
which are almost a factor of 10 lower than the observed values. For massive,
relaxed clusters we find, as in previous studies, a central drop in the
metallicity due to a suppression of the galactic winds by the pressure of the
ambient ICM. Combining ram-pressure stripping and galactic winds we find radial
metallicity profiles of the model clusters which agree qualitatively with
observed profiles. Only in the inner parts of massive clusters the observed
profiles are steeper than in the simulations. Also the combination of galactic
winds and ram-pressure stripping yields too low values for the ICM
metallicities. The slope of the redshift evolution of the mean metallicity in
the simulations agrees reasonably well with recent observations.

we test this hypothesis for a particular class of braided magnetic fields which
serve as a model for solar coronal loops. We explore the relationship between
Quasi-Separatrix Layers (QSLs), that is, layer-like structures with high Q
value, electric currents and integrated parallel currents, the latter being a
quantity closely related to the reconnection rate. It is found that as the
degree of braiding of the magnetic field is increased the maximum values of Q
increase exponentially. At the same time, the distribution of Q becomes
increasingly filamentary, with the width of the high-Q layers exponentially
decreasing. This is accompanied by an increase in the number of layers so that
as the field is increasingly braided the volume becomes occupied by a myriad of
thin QSLs. QSLs are not found to be good predictors of current features in this
class of braided fields. Indeed, despite the presence of multiple QSLs, the
current associated with the field remains smooth and large-scale under ideal
relaxation; the field dynamically adjusts to a smooth equilibrium. Regions of
high Q are found to be better related to regions of high integrated parallel
current than to actual current sheets.

to $\F_1$, and its group of $\F_1$-rational points should be its Weyl group. We
connect the notion of a torified variety to the notion of $\F_1$-schemes as
introduced by Connes and Consani. This yields models of toric varieties,
Schubert varieties and split reductive groups as $\Fun$-schemes. We endow the
class of $\F_1$-schemes with two classes of morphisms, one leading to a
satisfying notion of $\F_1$-rational points, the other leading to the notion of
an algebraic group over $\F_1$ such that every split reductive group is defined

combinatorics that are expected from parabolic subgroups of $\GL(n)$ and

several steps of the intrinsically universal QCA then correspond to one step of

the topology in the sense that each cell of the simulated QCA is encoded as a

integer line where infinitely many changes are allowed at each instance of
time. We describe the model using chameleons of two different colours, {\it
viz}., red ($R$) and blue ($B$). At each instance of time each chameleon
performs an independent but identical coin toss experiment with probability
$\alpha$ to decide whether to change its colour or not. If the coin lands head
then the creature retains its colour (this is to be interpreted as a
""success""), otherwise it observes the colours and coin tosses of its two
nearest neighbours and changes its colour only if, among its neighbors and
including itself, the proportion of successes of the other colour is larger
than the proportion of successes of its own colour. This produces a Markov
chain with infinite state space ${R, B}^{\Zbold}$. This model was first studied
by Chatterjee and Xu (2004) where different colours had different success
probabilities. In this work we consider the ""critical"" case where the success
probability, $\alpha$, is the same irrespective of the colour of the chameleon.
We show that starting from any initial translation invariant distribution of
colours the Markov chain converges to a limit of a single colour, i.e., even at
the critical case there is no ""coexistence"" of the two colours at the limit.
Moreover we show that starting with an i.i.d. colour distribution the limiting
distribution gives some advantage to the ""underdog"".

Calcium turns out to be depleted with respect to its Solar value, but its
gas-phase abundance is higher than that estimated in the interstellar medium in
Orion. The depletion is high (up to 80%) along the low-excited jets, while low
or no depletion is measured in the jets which show higher excitation

shock.
  Our results confirm the shock structure predicted by models and indicate that
the shocks occurring along the jets are partially destroying the dust grains
and that the efficiency of dust reprocessing strongly depend on shock velocity.
However, the high Ca gas-phase abundance estimated in some of the knots is not
well justified by existing models of dust reprocessing in shocks, and indicates
that the dust must have been partially reprocessed in the region where the flow

western side. Our analysis indicates that there is a cavity outside the central
source and the jets first traveled with constant velocity and then were slowed
down by the interactions between the jets and the interstellar medium (ISM).
The best fitted radius of the cavity is $\sim$0.31 pc on the eastern side and
$\sim$0.44 pc on the western side, and the densities also show asymmetry, of
$\sim$0.034 cm$^{-3}$ on the east to $\sim$0.12 cm$^{-3}$ on the west. The best

applied to another microquasar system, H 1743-322, and a large scale low

other microquasar systems, we suggest a generic scenario for microquasar jets,
classifying the observed jets into three main categories, with different jet
morphologies (and sizes) corresponding to different scales of vacuous
environments surrounding them. We also suggest that either continuous jets or
accretion disk winds, or both may be responsible for creating these cavities.
Therefore X-ray jets from microquasars provide us with a promising method of

single-spin in a semiconductor quantum dot adjacent to a fermionic reservoir
and show how the dynamics can be revealed in detail in an optical absorption

of the resulting Kondo exciton consists of three distinct frequency domains,
corresponding to short, intermediate and long times after the initial
excitation, which are in turn described by the three fixed points of the
single-impurity Anderson Hamiltonian. The zero-temperature power-law
singularity dominating the lineshape is linked to dynamically generated Kondo
correlations in the photo-excited state. We show that this power-law
singularity is tunable with gate voltage and magnetic field, and universal.

analytically and by means of numerical calculations. In order to do so I
completed studies in four different subjects. My first investigated subject was
a study of non-equilibrium phase transitions in weighted scale-free networks.
The second problem I examined was the ferromagnetic random bond Potts model
with large values of q on evolving scale-free networks which problem is
equivalent to an optimal cooperation problem. The third examined problem was
related to the large-q sate random bond Potts model also and I examined the
critical density of clusters which touched a certain border of a perpendicular
strip like geometry and expected to hold analytical forms deduced from
conformal invariance. The last investigated problem was a study of the
non-equilibrium dynamical behaviour of the antiferromagnetic Ising model on
two-dimensional triangular lattice at zero temperature in the absence of

essential for evaluating their capabilities for predicting the formation and
motion of lattice defects. We formulate a simple one-dimensional model problem
and give a detailed analysis of the stability of the force-based quasicontinuum
(QCF) method. The focus of the analysis is the question whether the QCF method
is able to predict a critical load at which fracture occurs. Numerical
experiments show that the spectrum of a linearized QCF operator is identical to
the spectrum of a linearized energy-based quasi-nonlocal quasicontinuum
operator (QNL), which we know from our previous analyses to be positive below
the critical load. However, the QCF operator is non-normal and it turns out
that it is not generally positive definite, even when all of its eigenvalues
are positive. Using a combination of rigorous analysis and numerical
experiments, we investigate in detail for which choices of ""function spaces""
the QCF operator is stable, uniformly in the size of the atomistic system.
Force-based multi-physics coupling methods are popular techniques to circumvent
the difficulties faced in formulating consistent energy-based coupling
pproaches. Even though the QCF method is possibly the simplest coupling method
of this kind, we anticipate that many of our observations apply more generally.

inspiration for the development of a novel bio-inspired algorithm, the

ghost modes in general. However, if we regard curvature squared terms as
quantum corrections to the original theory, the emergence of ghosts may be
simply due to the perturbative truncation of a full non-perturbative theory. If
this is the case, there should be a way to live with ghosts. In this paper, we
take the Euclidean path integral approach, in which ghost degrees of freedom
can be, and are integrated out in the Euclideanized spacetime. We apply this
procedure to Einstein gravity with a Weyl curvature squared correction in the
inflationary background. We find that the amplitude of tensor perturbations is
modified by a term of O(alpha^2 H^2) where alpha^2 is a coupling constant in
