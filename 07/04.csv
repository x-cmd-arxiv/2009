height, to probe models of dark energy and to constrain cosmological
parameters. Because peaks can be identified in two-dimensional WL maps
directly, they can provide constraints that are free from potential selection
effects and biases involved in identifying and determining the masses of galaxy
clusters. We have run cosmological N-body simulations to produce WL convergence
maps in three models with different constant values of the dark energy equation
of state parameter, w=-0.8, -1, and -1.2, with a fixed normalization of the
primordial power spectrum (corresponding to present-day normalizations of
sigma8=0.742, 0.798, and 0.839, respectively). By comparing the number of WL
peaks in 8 convergence bins in the range of -0.1 < kappa < 0.2, in multiple
realizations of a single simulated 3x3 degree field, we show that the first
(last) pair of models can be distinguished at the 95% (85%) confidence level. A
survey with depth and area (20,000 sq. degrees), comparable to those expected
from LSST, should have a factor of approx. 50 better parameter sensitivity. We
find that relatively low-amplitude peaks (kappa = 0.03), which typically do not
correspond to a single collapsed halo along the line of sight, account for most
of this sensitivity. We study a range of smoothing scales and source galaxy
redshifts (z_s). With a fixed source galaxy density of 15/arcmin^2, the best
results are provided by the smallest scale we can reliably simulate, 1
arcminute, and z_s=2 provides substantially better sensitivity than z_s< 1.5.

Although the RG was originally intended for strong randomness, i.e. for

simulations even in the regime of weak randomness. We use the RG flow to derive
how the correlation length scales with the width of the coupling distribution
in the limit of large coupling. This leads to the identification of a

also find universal scaling for small coupling. Finally, we show that the RG

gauge mediation is a universal formula governing gaugino and sfermion masses

models with direct gauge mediation predict anomalously small ratios of gaugino
to scalar masses. It was argued that the smallness of gaugino masses is a
consequence of being in the lowest energy state of the SUSY-breaking low energy
effective theory. To increase gaugino masses one either has to move to higher
metastable vacuum or alternatively remain in the original SUSY-breaking vacuum
but extend the theory by introducing a lower-lying vacuum elsewhere. We follow
the latter strategy and show that the ratio of gaugino to sfermion masses can
be continuously varied between zero and of order one by bringing in a lower
vacuum from infinity. We argue that the stability of the vacuum is directly
linked to the ratio between the gaugino masses and the underlying SUSY-breaking

together and compared to dust emission models allowing to constrain the dust
mass, the intensity of the mean radiation field, the abundance of Polycyclic
Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) particles. The total infrared emission (TIR) was
analyzed in function of UV and Optical colors and compared to predictions of

that cold-dust component emission dominates the infrared spectral energy
distribution of M31. The mean intensity of the radiation field heating the dust
is low (typically U<2, where U=1 is the value in the solar surrounding). Due to
the lack of submillimetric measurements the dust mass (M_{dust}) is only weakly
constrained by the infrared spectrum. We show that across the spiral-ring
structure of M31 a fraction >3% of the total dust mass is in PAHs. UV and
optical colors are correlated to (TIR/FUV) ratios in \sim 670 pc-sized regions
overall the disk of M31, although deviating from the IRX-beta relationship for
starburst galaxies. We derived that in 83% of the regions analyzed across the

\lambda > 4000 \AA and that dust in M31 appears mainly heated by populations a
few Gyr old even across the star-forming ring. The attenuation is varying
radially peaking near 10kpc and decreasing faster in the inner regions of M31

full numerical relativity, we catch zoom-whirl behavior despite dissipation.
The larger the mass ratio, the longer the pair can spend in orbit before
merging and therefore the more zooms and whirls seen. Larger spins also enhance
zoom-whirliness. An important implication is that these eccentric orbits can
merge during a whirl phase, before enough angular momentum has been lost to
truly circularize the orbit. Waveforms will be modulated by the harmonics of
zoom-whirls, showing quiet phases during zooms and louder glitches during

After release from a confining potential, atoms fall through a sheet of
resonant excitation laser light and the emitted fluorescence photons are imaged
onto an amplified CCD camera using a high numerical aperture optical system.
The imaging system reaches an extraordinary dynamic range, not attainable with
conventional absorption imaging. We demonstrate single-atom detection for
dilute atomic clouds with high efficiency where at the same time dense
Bose-Einstein condensates can be imaged without saturation or distortion. The
spatial resolution can reach the sampling limit as given by the 8 \mu m pixel
size in object space. Pulsed operation of the detector allows for slice images,
a first step toward a 3D tomography of the measured object. The scheme can
easily be implemented for any atomic species and all optical components are
situated outside the vacuum system. As a first application we perform
thermometry on rubidium Bose-Einstein condensates created on an atom chip.

the wastage of bandwidth due to unutilized periods of the channel. By
considering this fact, performance of MAC protocol can be enhanced. The purpose
of this work is to modify the existing protocol by enabling it to adapt

action whenever unutilized periods detected. In this way, to increase the
effective bandwidth utilization and determine how it behaves under increasing
load, and varying packet sizes. It will also include effects of attacks i.e.
Denial of service attacks, Replay Attack, Continuous Channel Access or
Exhaustion attack, Flooding attack, Jamming (Radio interference) attack,
Selective forwarding attack which degrade performance of MAC protocol. In
Continuous Channel Access or Exhaustion attack, a malicious node disrupts the
MAC protocol, by continuously requesting or transmitting over the channel. This
eventually leads a starvation for other nodes in the network w.r.t channel
access. remedy may be the network ignores excessive requests without sending
expensive radio transmissions. This limit however cannot drop below the
expected maximum data rate the network has to support. This limit is usually
coded into the protocol during the design phase and requires additional logic
also. Repeated application of these exhaustion or collision based MAC layer
attacks can lead into unfairness.

strong sense to an equilibrium state starting out from a generic pure state.
Nevertheless for large system size one observes temporal typicality. Namely,
for the overwhelming majority of the time instants, the statistics of
observables is practically indistinguishable from an effective equilibrium one.
In this paper we consider the Loschmidt echo (LE) to study this sort of unitary
equilibration after a quench. We draw several conclusions on general grounds
and on the basis of an exactly-solvable example of a quasi-free system. In
particular we focus on the whole probability distribution of observing a given
value of the LE after waiting a long time. Depending on the interplay between
the initial state and the quench Hamiltonian, we find different regimes
reflecting different equilibration dynamics. When the perturbation is small and
the system is away from criticality the probability distribution is Gaussian.
However close to criticality the distribution function approaches a double
peaked, ""batman-hood"" shaped, universal form.

Many galaxy evolution models assume that satellite galaxies eventually merge

on the Halo Occupation Distribution and radial profile of the remnants. Using
abundance matching to assign stellar mass/luminosity to subhalos, we compare
with observed galaxy clustering, satellite fractions, cluster satellite

modulates the amplitude of CMB fluctuations. We show that this scenario would
also lead to a spatial gradient in the amplitude of perturbations sigma_8, and
hence to a dipole asymmetry in any highly biased tracer of the underlying

the comoving distance to the last-scattering surface. This rules out the

background (CMB) on large angular scales is attributable to a superhorizon
curvaton fluctuation, then the simplest model predicts that the primordial
density fluctuations should be similarly asymmetric on all smaller scales. The
distribution of high-redshift quasars was recently used to constrain the power
asymmetry on scales k ~ 1.5h/Mpc, and the upper bound on the amplitude of the
asymmetry was found to be a factor of six smaller than the amplitude of the
asymmetry in the CMB. We show that it is not possible to generate an asymmetry
with this scale dependence by changing the relative contributions of the
inflaton and curvaton to the adiabatic power spectrum. Instead, we consider
curvaton scenarios in which the curvaton decays after dark matter freezes out,
thus generating isocurvature perturbations. If there is a superhorizon
fluctuation in the curvaton field, then the rms amplitude of these
perturbations will be asymmetric, and the asymmetry will be most apparent on
large angular scales in the CMB. We find that it is only possible to generate
the observed asymmetry in the CMB while satisfying the quasar constraint if the
curvaton's contribution to the total dark matter density is small, but nonzero.
The model also requires that the majority of the primordial power comes from
fluctuations in the inflaton field. Future observations and analyses of the CMB
will test this model because the power asymmetry generated by this model has a
specific spectrum, and the model requires that the current upper bounds on
isocurvature power are nearly saturated.

Previous proofs of AVIs' multisymplecticity assume that the potentials are of
an elastic type, i.e., specified by volume integration over the material
domain, an assumption violated by interaction-type potentials, such as penalty
forces used to model mechanical contact. We extend the proof of AVI
multisymplecticity, showing that AVIs remain multisymplectic under relaxed
assumptions on the type of potential. The extended theory thus accommodates the
simulation of mechanical contact in elastica (such as thin shells) and
multibody systems (such as granular materials) with no drift of conserved

the fact that the brighter supernovae have broader light curves.
One-dimensional modelling, with a certain choice of parameters, can reproduce
this general trend in the width-luminosity relation, but the processes of
ignition and detonation have recently been shown to be intrinsically
asymmetric. Here we report on multi-dimensional modelling of the explosion
physics and radiative transfer that reveals that the breaking of spherical
symmetry is a critical factor in determining both the width luminosity relation
and the observed scatter about it. The deviation from sphericity can also
explain the finite polarization detected in the light from some supernovae. The
slope and normalization of the width-luminosity relation has a weak dependence
on certain properties of the white dwarf progenitor, in particular the trace
abundances of elements other than carbon and oxygen. Failing to correct for

transient events in stars undergoing late stage stellar evolution. We use the
well-established techniques of stellar population modeling to age-date the
stars surrounding the site of the recent transient event in NGC 300 (NGC 300
OT2008-1). The surrounding stars must share a common turnoff mass with the
transient, since almost all stars form in stellar clusters that remain
physically associated for periods longer than the lifetime of the most massive
stars. We find that the precursor of NGC 300 OT2008-1 is surrounded by stars
that formed in a single burst between 8-13 Myr ago, with 70% confidence. The
transient was therefore likely to be due to a progenitor whose mass falls
between the main sequence turnoff mass (12 Msun) and the maximum stellar mass
(25 Msun) found for isochrones bounding this age range. We characterize the
general applicability of this technique in identifying precursor masses of
historic and future transients and supernovae (SNe), noting that it requires
neither precursor imaging nor sub-arcsecond accuracy in the position of the
transient. It is also based on the well-understood physics of the main
sequence, and thus may be a more reliable source of precursor masses than
fitting evolutionary tracks to precursor magnitudes. We speculate that if the
progenitor mass is close to 17 Msun, there may be a connection between optical
transients such as NGC 300 OT2008-1 and the missing type II-P SNe, known as the

composed of ceramide NS-24:0, free fatty acid 24:0 and cholesterol, to address
the effect of the different components in the stratum corneum (the outermost
layer of skin) lipid matrix on its structural properties. Bilayers containing
ceramide molecules show higher in-plane density and hence lower rate of passive
transport compared to phospholipid bilayers. At physiological temperatures, for
all composition ratios explored, the lipids are in a gel phase with ordered
lipid tails. However, the large asymmetry in the lengths of the two tails of
the ceramide molecule leads to a fluid like environment at the bilayer
mid-plane. The lateral pressure profiles show large local variations across the
bilayer for pure ceramide or any of the two component mixtures. Close to the
skin composition ratio, the lateral pressure fluctuations are greatly
suppressed, the ceramide tails from the two leaflets interdigitate
significantly, the depression in local density at the inter-leaflet region is
lowered, and the bilayer have lowered elastic moduli. This indicates that the
observed composition ratio in the stratum corneum lipid layer is responsible
for both the good barrier properties and the stability of the lipid structure
against mechanical stresses.

approximation. Such equations describe the dynamics of a condensate in the
classical limit in terms of the variables < x > and < p > as well as their

interatomic interactions which generate nonlinearity make the system less

semiclassical equations, and the equations to be solved are far less
computationally intensive than solving the GPE which make them ideal for
providing quick diagnostics, and for obtaining new intuitive insight.

objective is to minimize the total cost of this path. In the directed latency

to each node. Both of these problems are NP-hard. The best known approximation
algorithms for ATSPP had ratio O(log n) until the very recent result that
improves it to O(log n/ log log n). However, only a bound of O(sqrt(n)) for the
integrality gap of its linear programming relaxation has been known. For
directed latency, the best previously known approximation algorithm has a

relaxation of ATSPP by the same factor. This solves an open problem posed by
Chekuri and Pal [2007]. We then pursue a deeper study of this linear program

E^2F(E) the lowest or most constraining is the E>5TeV upper limit for the Coma

our most stringent limit for E>5 TeV, on the total energy content in

spatial distribution following the thermal gas in the cluster, is found to be
~0.2 times the thermal energy, or ~10^{62}erg. The E>5 TeV gamma-ray threshold
in this case corresponds to cosmic-ray proton energies >50TeV. Our upper limits
rule out the most optimistic theoretical models for gamma ray emission from

to be accurate then the information would be irretrievably lost and a

to sort a multiset $S$ of size $n$, the best known upper and lower bounds still
differ by a term linear in $n$. In this paper we restrict our attention to
online stable sorting and prove upper and lower bounds that are within (o (n))
not only of each other but also of the best known upper bound for offline
sorting. Specifically, we first prove that if the number of distinct elements

where $H$ is the entropy of the distribution of the elements in $S$. We then
give a simple proof that ((H + 1) n - o (n)) comparisons are necessary in the

The mathematical modeling of their interaction through multivariate dynamical

such models against available data. Given the prevalence of stochasticity and
noise in biochemical systems inference for stochastic models is of special
interest. In this paper we present a simple and computationally efficient
algorithm for the estimation of biochemical kinetic parameters from gene
reporter data. We use the linear noise approximation to model biochemical
reactions through a stochastic dynamic model which essentially approximates a
diffusion model by an ordinary differential equation model with an
appropriately defined noise process. An explicit formula for the likelihood
function can be derived allowing for computationally efficient parameter
estimation. The proposed algorithm is embedded in a Bayesian framework and
inference is performed using Markov chain Monte Carlo. The major advantage of
the method is that in contrast to the more established diffusion approximation
based methods the computationally costly methods of data augmentation are not
necessary. Our approach also allows for unobserved variables and measurement
error. The application of the method to both simulated and experimental data
shows that the proposed methodology provides a useful alternative to diffusion

Cru, T CrB, and CD -57 3057 are well described by emission from a
single-temperature, optically thin thermal plasma, plus an unresolved 6.4-6.9
keV Fe line complex. The X-ray spectrum of CH Cyg contains an additional bright
soft component. For all 4 systems, the spectra suffer high levels of absorption
from material that both fully and partially covers the source of hard X-rays.
The XRT data did not show any of the rapid, periodic variations that one would
expect if the X-ray emission were due to accretion onto a rotating, highly
magnetized WD. The X-rays were thus more likely from the accretion-disk
boundary layer around a massive, non-magnetic WD in each binary. The X-ray
emission from RT Cru varied on timescales of a few days. This variability is
consistent with being due to changes in the absorber that partially covers the
source, suggesting localized absorption from a clumpy medium moving into the
line of sight. The X-ray emission from CD -57 3057 and T CrB also varied during
the 9 months of Swift observations, in a manner that was also consistent with
variable absorption.

semiconductor rings can be tuned with external gate voltages. Here we consider
the case of a periodically changing spin-orbit interaction strength as induced
by sinusoidal voltages. In a closed one dimensional quantum ring with weak
spin-orbit coupling, Rabi oscillations are shown to appear. We find that the
time evolution of initially localized wave packets exhibits a series of
collapse and revival phenomena. Partial revivals -- that are typical in
nonlinear systems -- are shown to correspond to superpositions of states
localized at different spatial positions along the ring. These ""spintronic
Schrodinger-cat sates"" appear periodically, and similarly to their counterparts
in other physical systems, they are found to be sensitive to environment
induced disturbances. The time dependent spin transport problem, when leads are
attached to the ring, is also solved. We show that the ""sideband currents""
induced by the oscillating spin-orbit interaction strength can become the
dominant output channel, even in the presence of moderate thermal fluctuations
and random scattering events.

Bell inequalities deny at least either realism or Einstein locality. Here we
investigate the premises of the Bell-type inequalities by returning to earlier
inequalities presented by Boole and the findings of Vorob'ev as related to
these inequalities. These findings together with a space-time generalization of
Boole's elements of logic lead us to a completely transparent Einstein local
counterexample from everyday life that violates certain variations of the Bell
inequalities. We show that the counterexample suggests an interpretation of the
Born rule as a pre-measure of probability that can be transformed into a
Kolmogorov probability measure by certain Einstein local space-time
characterizations of the involved random variables.

Highlands of Namibia, is an array of four imaging atmospheric-Cherenkov
telescopes designed to detect gamma-rays in the very-high-energy (VHE; E > 100
GeV) domain. It is an ideal instrument for surveying the Galactic plane in
search of new sources of VHE gamma-rays, due to its location in the Southern
Hemisphere, its excellent sensitivity, and its large field-of-view. The
H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey (GPS) began in 2004 and initial observations of
the Galactic plane resulted in the discovery of numerous VHE gamma-ray
emitters. This original H.E.S.S. GPS covered the inner Galaxy within +/- 30 deg
in longitude and +/- 3 deg in latitude. In the last four years, the
longitudinal extent of the survey has more than doubled, now including the
region l = 275 deg - 60 deg, and the exposure in the inner Galaxy has also been
significantly increased. These efforts have consequently led to the discovery
of many previously-unknown VHE gamma-ray sources with high statistical
significance. We report on the current status of this ongoing, extended
H.E.S.S. GPS, present the latest images of the survey region, and highlight the
most recent discoveries.
