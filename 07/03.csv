of the luminous transient discovered in the nearby galaxy NGC 300 in May 2008.
The spectrum, obtained three months after discovery, shows that the transient
is very luminous in the mid-IR. Furthermore, the spectrum shows strong, broad
emission features at 8 and 12 micron that are observed in Galactic carbon-rich
proto-planetary nebulae. Combining these data with published optical and
near-IR photometry obtained at the same epoch, we find that the mid-IR excess
traced by the Spitzer spectrum accounts for ~20% of the total energy output.
This component can be well explained by emission from ~3x10^-4 Msun of
pre-existing progenitor dust at temperature ~400 K. The spectral energy
distribution of the transient also shows a near-IR excess that can be explained
by emission from newly-formed dust in the ejecta. Alternatively, both the
near-IR and mid-IR excesses can together be explained by a single pre-existing
geometrically thick dust shell. In light of the new observations obtained with
Spitzer, we revisit the analysis of the optical spectra and kinematics, which
were compared to the massive yellow-hypergiant IRC+10420 in previous studies.
We show that proto-planetary nebulae share many properties with the NGC 300
transient and SN 2008S. We conclude that even though the explosion of a massive
star (> 10 Msun) cannot be ruled out, an explosive event on a massive (6-10
Msun) carbon-rich AGB/super-AGB or post-AGB star is consistent with all
observations of the transients and their progenitors presented thus far.

(SZE) signal from clusters of galaxies by stacking the regions around hundreds
of known X-ray clusters. We detect the average SZE at a very high significance
level. The average cluster signal is spatially resolved in the W band. This
mean signal is compared with the expected signal from the same clusters
calculated on the basis of archival ROSAT data. From the comparison we conclude
that the observed SZE seems to be less than the expected signal derived from
X-ray measurements when a standard beta-model is assumed for the gas
distribution. This conclusion is model dependent. Our predictions depend mostly
on the assumptions made about the core radius of clusters and the slope of the
gas density profile. Models with steeper profiles are able to simultaneously
fit both X-ray and WMAP data better than a beta-model. However, the agreement
is not perfect and we find that it is still difficult to make the X-ray and SZE
results agree. A model assuming point source contamination in SZE clusters
renders a better fit to the one-dimensional SZE profiles thus suggesting that
contamination from point sources could be contributing to a diminution of the
SZE signal. Selecting a model that better fits both X-ray and WMAP data away
from the very central region, we estimate the level of contamination and find
that on average, the point source contamination is on the level of 16 mJy (at
41 GHz), 26 mJy (at 61 GHz) and 18 mJy (at 94 GHz). These estimated fluxes are
marginally consistent with the estimated contamination derived from radio and
infrared surveys thus suggesting that the combination of a steeper gas profile
and the contribution from point sources allows us to consistently explain the
X-ray emission and SZE in galaxy clusters as measured by ROSAT and WMAP.

divided into two regimes: (1) disruption and (2) hit-and-run (a grazing
inelastic collision and projectile escape). Disruption occurs when the impact
parameter is near zero, when the projectile mass is small compared to the
target, or at extremely high velocities. In the disruption regime, we derive
the criteria for catastrophic disruption (when half the total colliding mass is
lost), the transition energy between accretion and erosion, and a scaling law
for the change in bulk composition (iron-to-silicate ratio) resulting from
collisional stripping of a mantle.

estimate some variables with high precision, but perhaps at relatively low

they can be conditioned upon, allowing further inference to be done
efficiently. Specifically, we consider optical character recognition (OCR)
systems that can be bootstrapped by identifying a subset of correctly
translated document words with very high precision. This ""clean set"" is
subsequently used as document-specific training data. While many current OCR
systems produce measures of confidence for the identity of each letter or word,
thresholding these confidence values, even at very high values, still produces
some errors.
  We introduce a novel technique for identifying a set of correct words with
very high precision. Rather than estimating posterior probabilities, we bound
the probability that any given word is incorrect under very general
assumptions, using an approximate worst case analysis. As a result, the
parameters of the model are nearly irrelevant, and we are able to identify a
subset of words, even in noisy documents, of which we are highly confident. On
our set of 10 documents, we are able to identify about 6% of the words on
average without making a single error. This ability to produce word lists with
very high precision allows us to use a family of models which depends upon such
clean word lists.

the dark matter candidate is a scalar, the lightest component of an extra Higgs
doublet. We first revisit the case for the elastic scattering of a light scalar
WIMP, M_DM~10 GeV, a scenario which requires that a fraction of events in DAMA

(iDM). This option is technically natural in the IDM, in the sense that the
mass splitting between the lightest and next-to-lightest neutral scalars may be
protected by a Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry. We show that candidates with a mass
M_DM between ~535 GeV and ~50 TeV may reproduce the DAMA data and have a cosmic
abundance in agreement with WMAP. This range may be extended to candidates as
light as ~50 GeV if we exploit the possibility that the approximate PQ symmetry
is effectively conserved and that a primordial asymmetry in the dark sector may
survive until freeze-out.

have been performed to interpret the data. The fitting of the spectral energy
distribution, in combination with the measured visibilities, does not provide
evidence for an extended circumstellar disk with sizes > 100 AU but requires
the presence of an extended envelope. The data are not able to constrain the
presence of a small-scale disk in addition to an envelope. In either case, the
interferometry measurements indicate the existence of a strongly bloated,
relatively cool central object, possibly tracing the recent accretion history
of M8E-IR. In addition, we present 24.5 micron images that clearly distinguish
between M8E-IR and the neighbouring ultracompact HII region and which show the
cometary-shaped infrared morphology of the latter source. Our results show that
IR interferometry, combined with radiative transfer modelling, can be a viable
tool to reveal crucial structure information on embedded massive young stellar

very important tool for understanding galaxy evolution. Although there are many
studies at high redshift, they are rather scarce at lower redshifts. However,
low redshift studies can provide important clues about the evolution of
galaxies, furnishing the required link between local and high redshift
universe. In this work we focus on the metallicity of the gas of star-forming
galaxies at low redshift, looking for signs of chemical evolution.
  To analyze the metallicity contents star-forming galaxies of similar
luminosities and masses at different redshifts. With this purpose, we present a
study of the metallicity of relatively massive (log(M_star/M_sun)>10.5) star
forming galaxies from SDSS--DR5 (Sloan Digital Sky Survey--Data Release 5),
using different redshift intervals from 0.04 to 0.4.
  We used data processed with the STARLIGHT spectral synthesis code, correcting
the fluxes for dust extinction, estimating metallicities using the R_23 method,
and segregating the samples with respect to the value of the
[NII]6583/[OII]3727 line ratio in order to break the R_23 degeneracy selecting
the upper branch. We analyze the luminosity and mass-metallicity relations, and
the effect of the Sloan fiber diameter looking for possible biases.
  By dividing our redshift samples in intervals of similar magnitude and
comparing them, significant signs of metallicity evolution are found.
Metallicity correlates inversely with redshift: from redshift 0 to 0.4 a
decrement of ~0.1 dex in 12+log(O/H) is found.

$\varDelta\approx 300$ MeV the $\Delta$-resonance excitation energy. These are
all ""predictive"" powers in the sense that no unknown low-energy constants enter

uncertainty on the basis of natural size for $p^4$ effects, we find that
uncertainty of such a NNLO result is comparable to the uncertainty of the
present experimental data for low-energy Compton scattering. We find an
excellent agreement with the experimental cross section data up to at least the
pion-production threshold. Nevertheless, for the proton's magnetic
polarizability we obtain a value of $(4.0\pm 0.7)\times 10^{-4}$ fm$^3$, in
significant disagreement with the current PDG value. Unlike the previous
$\chi$PT studies of Compton scattering, we perform the calculations in a
manifestly Lorentz-covariant fashion, refraining from the heavy-baryon (HB)
expansion. The difference between the lowest order HB$\chi$PT and B$\chi$PT
results for polarizabilities is found to be appreciable. We discuss the chiral
behavior of proton polarizabilities in both HB$\chi$PT and B$\chi$PT with the
hope to confront it with lattice QCD calculations in a near future. In studying
some of the polarized observables, we identify the regime where their naive
low-energy expansion begins to break down, thus addressing the forthcoming
precision measurements at the HIGS facility.

apparently paradoxical principle, named since then after him, which can be
summarized as follows: {\it 'Every new member in a hierarchical organization
climbs the hierarchy until he/she reaches his/her level of maximum
incompetence'}. Despite its apparent unreasonableness, such a principle would
realistically act in any organization where the mechanism of promotion rewards
the best members and where the mechanism at their new level in the hierarchical
structure does not depend on the competence they had at the previous level,
usually because the tasks of the levels are very different to each other. Here
we show, by means of agent based simulations, that if the latter two features
actually hold in a given model of an organization with a hierarchical
structure, then not only is the Peter principle unavoidable, but also it yields
in turn a significant reduction of the global efficiency of the organization.
Within a game theory-like approach, we explore different promotion strategies
and we find, counterintuitively, that in order to avoid such an effect the best
ways for improving the efficiency of a given organization are either to promote
each time an agent at random or to promote randomly the best and the worst
members in terms of competence.

quadratically with the forcing strength, and (ii) the strongest effect is seen
for forcing that is detuned from the Hopf frequency. To apply our results to
specific models, we perform a perturbation analysis on general two-component
reaction-diffusion systems, which reveals whether the forcing suppresses or
enhances the spatial pattern. For the suppressing case, our results explain
features of previous experiments on the CDIMA chemical reaction. However, we
also find examples of the enhancing case, which has not yet been observed in

angular momentum provide the natural ground to start detailed studies of the
influence of strong-field spin effects on gravitational wave observations of
coalescing binaries. Furthermore, such systems may be the preferred end-state
of the inspiral of generic supermassive binary black-hole systems. In view of
this, we have computed the inspiral and merger of a large set of binary systems
of equal-mass black holes with spins parallel to the orbital angular momentum
but otherwise arbitrary. Our attention is particularly focused on the
gravitational-wave emission so as to quantify how much spin effects contribute
to the signal-to-noise ratio, to the horizon distances, and to the relative
event rates for the representative ranges in masses and detectors. As expected,
the signal-to-noise ratio increases with the projection of the total black hole
spin in the direction of the orbital momentum. We find that equal-spin binaries
with maximum spin aligned with the orbital angular momentum are more than
""three times as loud"" as the corresponding binaries with anti-aligned spins,
thus corresponding to event rates up to 30 times larger. We also consider the
waveform mismatch between the different spinning configurations and find that,
within our numerical accuracy, binaries with opposite spins S_1=-S_2 cannot be
distinguished whereas binaries with spin S_1=S_2 have clearly distinct
gravitational-wave emissions. Finally, we derive a simple expression for the
energy radiated in gravitational waves and find that the binaries always have
efficiencies E_rad/M > 3.6%, which can become as large as E_rad/M = 10% for
maximally spinning binaries with spins aligned with the orbital angular
momentum.

photometry. Also, the phases were investigated to determine the dominating
mid-infrared source in the close southern binary. The data were fit with the
help of a sophisticated physical disc model. This model utilises the radiative
transfer code MC3D that is based on the Monte-Carlo method. Extended
mid-infrared emission is found around all three components of the system.
Simultaneous fits to the photometric and interferometric data confirm the
picture of an almost face-on circumstellar disc around T Tau N. Towards this
star, the silicate band is seen in emission. This emission feature is used to
model the dust content of the circumstellar disc. Clear signs of dust
processing are found. Towards T Tau S, the silicate band is seen in absorption.
This absorption is strongly pronounced towards the infrared companion T Tau Sa
as can be seen from the first individual N-band spectra for the two southern
components. Our fits support the previous suggestion that an almost edge-on
disc is present around T Tau Sa. This disc is thus misaligned with respect to
the circumstellar disc around T Tau N. The interferometric data indicate that
the disc around T Tau Sa is oriented in the north-south direction, which
favours this source as launching site for the east-western jet. We further
determine from the interferometric data the relative positions of the
components of the southern binary.

The fast Cherenkov pulses are sampled by low-power Domino Ring Sampler chips
(DRS2) and temporarily stored in an array of 1024 capacitors. Signals are
sampled at the ultra-fast speed of 2 GSample/s, which allows a very precise
measurement of the signal arrival times in all pixels. They are then digitized

controlled through a VME interface and steered by the slow control software

order of chaos may demand a certain reconsideration of the approach to the
classical mechanics. For this we suggest to consider the viewpoint that
spatio-temporal relations between objects are emergent and that they are but a
result of complex interactions of objects. Such an approach is a natural
continuation of the revision of the notions of space and time started by the
general theory of relativity. It leads to a possible extension of the structure
of the classical mechanics. Namely, the result of the objects interactions can
be wider than the spatio-temporal relations. In this case interactions form a
generalized space (""Field-Space"") wider than its spatio-temporal section (while
the known interactions are embedded within that section). The study of such
hypothesis demands constructing a theory, not relying on space and time as
primitive notions. As primary elements of such a theory we consider objects and
purely informational connections between them, not expressed in spatio-temporal
terms. Following the logic of this theory, the world constitutes a complex
information web. The Web is in the state of a constant flux (of a more general
category than the one of the quantum fields) - an incessant change of
connections, the complex order of which comprises the order of chaos. Reminding
the space build-up from the Regge skeleton, the Web builds a unified
Field-Space of pure information, manifested in space as energy distribution. We
describe the emergence of spatio-temporal laws from the viewpoint of purely
informational physics. The suggested construction of physics on the purely
informational basis is a candidate for the theory of quantum gravity.

We show that the bulk masses can be aligned with the down type Yukawa couplings
by an appropriate choice of bulk flavon field representations and TeV brane
dynamics. This alignment could reduce the flavor violating effects to levels
which allow for a Kaluza-Klein scale as low as 2-3 TeV, making the model
observable at the LHC. However, the up-type Yukawa couplings on the IR brane,
which are bounded from below by recent bounds on CP violation in the D system,
induce flavor misalignment radiatively. Off-diagonal down-type Yukawa couplings
and kinetic mixings for the down quarks are both consequences of this effect.
These radiative Yukawa corrections can be reduced by raising the flavon VEV on
the IR brane (at the price of some moderate tuning), or by extending the Higgs
sector. The flavor changing effects from the radiatively induced Yukawa mixing
terms are at around the current upper experimental bounds. We also show the
generic bounds on UV-brane induced flavor violating effects, and comment on
possible additional flavor violations from bulk flavor gauge bosons and the

We find three objects showing variability with J-band amplitudes >0.5 mag; five
additional objects exhibit low-level variations. All three highly variable
sources have been previously identified as highly variable; thus we establish
the long-term nature of their flux changes. The lightcurves contain periodic
components with timescales of ~0.5-8 days, but have additional irregular
variations superimposed -- the characteristic behaviour for classical T Tauri
stars. Based on the colour variability, we conclude that hot spots are the
dominant cause of the variations in two objects, including one likely brown
dwarf, with spot temperatures in the range of 6000-7000 K. For the third one
(#2), a brown dwarf or very low mass star, inhomogenities at the inner edge of
the disk are the likely origin of the variability. Based on mid-infrared data
from Spitzer, we confirm that the three highly variable sources are surrounded
by circum-(sub)-stellar disks. They show typical SEDs for T Tauri-like objects.
Using SED models we infer an enhanced scaleheight in the disk for the object
#2, which favours the detection of disk inhomogenities in lightcurves and is
thus consistent with the information from variability. In the SOri cluster,
about every fifth accreting low-mass object shows persistent high-level
photometric variability. We demonstrate that estimates for fundamental
parameters in such objects can be significantly improved by determining the

infimum Dirichlet energy, Ecal(H), for continuous maps satisfying tangent
boundary conditions of arbitrary homotopy type H. The expression for Ecal(H)
involves a topological invariant - the spelling length - associated with the
(nonabelian) fundamental group of the n-times punctured two-sphere, pi_1(S^2 -
{s_1,..., s_n},*). The lower bound for Ecal(H) is obtained from combinatorial
group theory arguments, while the upper bound is obtained by constructing
explicit representatives which, on all but an arbitrarily small subset of O,
are alternatively locally conformal or anticonformal. For conformal and
anticonformal classes (classes containing wholly conformal and anticonformal
representatives respectively), the expression for Ecal(H) reduces to a previous
result involving the degrees of a set of regular values s_1,..., s_n in the
target S^2 space. These degrees may be viewed as invariants associated with the
abelianization of \pi_1(S^2 - {s_1,..., s_n}, *). For nonconformal classes,
however, Ecal(H) may be strictly greater than the abelian bound. This stems
from the fact that, for nonconformal maps, the number of preimages of certain
regular values may necessarily be strictly greater than the absolute value of
their degrees.
  This work is motivated by the theoretical modelling of nematic liquid

the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) sample, which consists of five clusters of
galaxies within the redshift range 0.18 $\leq$ z $\leq$ 0.25, imaged in the
central 0.5-2 Mpc in very good seeing conditions, we have studied the
quantitative morphology of their bright galaxy population
  Methods: We have analyzed the surface brightness profiles of the galaxy
population in those clusters. Previously, we have performed simulations in
order to check the reliability of the fits. We have also derived a quantitative
morphological classification.
  Results: The structural parameters derived from these analysis have been
analyzed. We have obtained that the structural parameters of E/S0 galaxies are
similar to those showed by galaxies in low redshift clusters. However, the disc
scales are different. In particular, the scales of the discs of galaxies at
medium redshift clusters are statistically different than those located in
similar galaxies in the Coma cluster. But, the scales of the discs of galaxies
in medium redshift clusters are similar to nearby field galaxies.
  Conclusions: The results suggest that the evolution of the disc component of
galaxies in clusters is faster than in field ones. Mechanisms like galaxy
harassment showing timescales of $\sim 1$Gyr could be the responsible of this
disc scale evolution. This indicates that spiral galaxies in clusters have
suffered a strong evolution in the last 2.5 Gyr or that Coma is in some way
anomalous.

lattice on the trap potential. In the compressible state, we find that the
smooth variation of the gas density around the trap center leads to softening
of the singular behavior of S(q,omega) at Lieb-1 mode compared to the behavior
predicted for homogeneous 1D systems. Nevertheless, the density-averaged
response remains a non-analytic function of q and omega at Lieb-1 mode in the
limit of weak trap confinement. The exponent of the power-law non-analyticity
is modified due to the inhomogeneity in a universal way, and thus, bears
unambiguously the information about the (homogeneous) Lieb-Liniger model. A
strong optical lattice causes formation of Mott phases. Deep in the Mott

and characterized by different dynamical exponents: one being ballistic with

rise to multiple dynamical scales. We find that at temperature T=0, the

the smaller effective dimension d+z. Its self-interaction leads to logarithmic

finite temperature, the coexistence of two different dynamical scales gives
rise to a modified quantum-to-classical crossover. It extends over a
parametrically large regime with intricate interactions of quantum and
classical fluctuations leading to a universal T-dependence of the correlation
length independent of the interaction amplitude. The multiple scales are also
reflected in the phase diagram and in the critical thermodynamics. In
particular, we find that the latter cannot be interpreted in terms of only a
single dynamical exponent: whereas, e.g., the critical specific heat is
determined by the z=3 mode, the critical compressibility is found to be
dominated by the z=2 fluctuations.

to the resolution of a Schrodinger equation in a double well potential. They
obey the general scaling law e_n \propto B^{2/3} f_n(Delta /B^{2/3}. They
evolve continuously from a sqrt{n B} to a linear (n+1/2)B dependence, with a
[(n+1/2)B]^{2/3} dependence at the transition. The spectrum in the vicinity of
the topological transition is very well described by a semiclassical
quantization rule. This model describes continuously the coupling between
valleys associated with the two Dirac points, when approaching the transition.
It is applied to the tight-binding model of graphene and its generalization

More precisely, we employ fitness and clustering based driving forces for
guiding network structural dynamics, which in turn are controlled by the
population dynamics of an evolutionary algorithm. To evaluate the effect this
has on evolution, experiments are conducted on six engineering design problems

fitness. Recent studies suggest that it may also play a vital role in enabling
the evolution of species. Increasing robustness, so is proposed, can lead to
the emergence of evolvability if evolution proceeds over a neutral network that
extends far throughout the fitness landscape. Here, we show that the design
principles used to achieve robustness dramatically influence whether robustness
leads to evolvability. In simulation experiments, we find that purely redundant
systems have remarkably low evolvability while degenerate, i.e. partially
redundant, systems tend to be orders of magnitude more evolvable. Surprisingly,
the magnitude of observed variation in evolvability can neither be explained by
differences in the size nor the topology of the neutral networks. This suggests
that degeneracy, a ubiquitous characteristic in biological systems, may be an
important enabler of natural evolution. More generally, our study provides
valuable new clues about the origin of innovations in complex adaptive systems.

cells. A well-known example is the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
cascade, where in each layer of the cascade a protein is phosphorylated at two
sites. It has long been known that the response of a MAPK pathway strongly
depends on whether the enzymes that modify the protein act processively or
distributively: distributive mechanism, in which the enzyme molecules have to
release the substrate molecules in between the modification of the two sites,
can generate an ultrasensitive response and lead to hysteresis and bistability.
We study by Green's Function Reaction Dynamics, a stochastic scheme that makes
it possible to simulate biochemical networks at the particle level and in time
and space, a dual phosphorylation cycle in which the enzymes act according to a
distributive mechanism. We find that the response of this network can differ
dramatically from that predicted by a mean-field analysis based on the chemical
rate equations. In particular, rapid rebindings of the enzyme molecules to the
substrate molecules after modification of the first site can markedly speed up
the response, and lead to loss of ultrasensitivity and bistability. In essence,
rapid enzyme-substrate rebindings can turn a distributive mechanism into a
processive mechanism. We argue that slow ADP release by the enzymes can protect
the system against these rapid rebindings, thus enabling ultrasensitivity and
bistability.

narrowing of the Raman-active Fe and As vibrations upon cooling below the
spin-density-wave transition Ts. We attribute this effect to the opening of the
spin-density-wave gap. The electron-phonon linewidths inferred from these data
greatly exceed the predictions of ab-initio density functional calculations
without spin polarization, which may imply that local magnetic moments survive
well above Ts. A first-order structural transition accompanying the
spin-density-wave transition induces discontinuous jumps in the phonon
frequencies. These anomalies are increasingly suppressed for higher potassium
concentrations. We also observe subtle phonon anomalies at the superconducting
transition temperature Tc, with a behavior qualitatively similar to that in the
cuprate superconductors.

collapsars. One is two-dimensional MHD code that are performed using the
Newtonian (ZEUS-2D) code where realistic equation of state, neutrino cooling
and heating processes are taken into account. The other one is two-dimensional
general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) code. I have performed
numerical simulations of collapsars using these codes and realistic progenitor
models. In the Newtonian code, it is found that neutrino heating processes are
not efficient enough to launch a jet in this study. It is also found that a jet
is launched mainly by toroidal fields that are amplified by the winding-up
effect. However, since the ratio of total energy relative to the rest-mass
energy in the jet is not as high as several hundred, we conclude that the jets
seen in this study are not GRB jets. In the GRMHD simulation, it is shown that
a jet is launched from the center of the progenitor. We also find that the mass
accretion rate after the launch of the jet shows rapid time variability that
resembles to a typical time profile of a GRB. We find that the energy flux per
unit rest-mass flux is as high as 10^2 at the bottom of the jet. Thus we
conclude that the bulk Lorentz factor of the jet can be potentially high when
it propagates outward. We also performed two-dimensional relativistic
hydrodynamic simulations of the collapsar model to investigate the explosive
nucleosynthesis happened there. It is found that the amount of 56Ni is very
sensitive to the energy deposition rate. Thus the synthesized 56Ni can be
little even if the total explosion energy is as large as 10^52 erg. We conclude
that some GRBs can associate with faint supernovae.

Among various scenarios proposed
to explain the nature of the outburst, the most promising is a stellar merger
event. The results of spectroscopic observations of the object obtained in
October 2005 with the Keck/HIRES instrument, presented in detail in Paper I,
are analysed and discussed. Our analysis of the molecular bands and the P-Cyg
profiles of atomic lines shows that the object loses matter with a velocity of
up to 215 km/s and a rate of 10^{-6} - 10^{-5} M_sun/yr. In the profiles of
some atomic lines, we have also found evidence of matter infall. A narrow
absorption component, which is particularly strong in some P-Cyg profiles, may
indicate that a jet-like outflow has also been formed. We show that the
observed emission in the [Fe II] lines and an eclipse-like event observed in
November/December 2006 was probably caused by interactions of the expanding
matter, ejected by V838 Mon in 2002, with radiation from the B3V companion. In
particular, the observed profiles of the [Fe II] lines can be easily modelled
in this scenario and allow us to estimate parameters of the system, such as the
position of the B3V companion relative to V838 Mon and the line of sight,
density in the outflowing matter, and mass lost in the 2002 eruption. The
observed appearance of strong H-alpha emission, just before and during the
eclipse-like event, can be interpreted as a result of the accretion of the
outflowing matter onto the B3V companion: the accreted matter, shocked above
the stellar surface, can be a source of extreme-UV and soft X-ray radiation
capable of ionizing and exciting H in the outflow.

$\Delta t$ for eight separate periods, and we found that $\Delta t$ is not
constant changing be tween 30 and 70 days during the monitoring period. Since
$\Delta t$ is the ligh t travel time from the central energy source out to the
surrounding dust torus, this is the first convincing evidence that the inner
radius of dust torus did ch ange in an individual AGN. In order to relate such
a change of $\Delta t$ with a change of AGN luminosity $L$, we presented a
method of taking an average of th e observed $V$-band fluxes that corresponds
to the measured value of $\Delta t$, and we found that the time-changing track
of NGC 4151 in the $\Delta t$ versus $L$ diagram during the monitoring period
deviates from the relation of $\Delta t \propto L^{0.5}$ expected from dust
reverberation. This result, combined with t he elapsed time from period to

pion DA nullifies at the end-point as $\sqrt x$ or slower. That makes the
$e^+e^-\to \pi^0\pi^0$ process unique probe of the shape of the meson DAs. The
estimated cross section is rather small, for $\sqrt s = 3$ GeV it ranges from a
fraction of femtobarn (for the asymptotic DA) to couple of femtobarn (for the
Chernyak-Zhitnitsky DA). The observation of the process $e^+e^-\to\pi^0\pi^0$
with the cross section higher as estimated here would imply very unusual form
of the pion DA, e.g. the flat one. The derived amplitude can be easily
generalized to other processes like $e^+e^-\to \sigma\sigma, K_SK_S, \eta\eta,
\eta^\prime\eta, \pi^0 f_2$, etc.

gauge theory in terms of the Abelian fields and monopoles extracted from
non-Abelian link variables without adopting gauge fixing.
  Firstly, the static quark-antiquark potential and force are computed with the
Abelian and monopole Polyakov loop correlators, and the resulting string
tensions are found to be identical to the non-Abelian string tension. These
potentials also show the scaling behavior with respect to the change of lattice

  Secondly, the profile of the color-electric field between a quark and an
antiquark is investigated with the Abelian and monopole Wilson loops. The
color-electric field is squeezed into a flux tube due to monopole supercurrent
with the same Abelian color direction. The parameters corresponding to the
penetration and coherence lengths show the scaling behavior, and the ratio of
these lengths, i.e, the Ginzburg-Landau parameter, indicates that the vacuum
type is near the border of the type1 and type2 (dual) superconductor.
  These results are summarized that the Abelian fundamental charge defined in
an arbitrary color direction is confined inside a hadronic state by the dual
Meissner effect. As the color-neutral state in any Abelian color direction
corresponds to the physical color-singlet state, this effect explains
non-Abelian color confinement and supports the existence of a gauge-invariant
mechanism of color confinement due to the dual Meissner effect caused by
Abelian monopoles.

the interaction of the theories of characteristic classes and mixed Hodge
theory for singular spaces in the complex algebraic context. It uses M. Saito's
deep theory of mixed Hodge modules as a ""black box"", thinking about them as
""constructible or perverse sheaves of Hodge structures"", having the same
functorial calculus of Grothendieck functors. For the ""constant Hodge sheaf"",
one gets the ""motivic characteristic classes"" of Brasselet-Schuermann-Yokura,
whereas the classes of the ""intersection homology Hodge sheaf"" were studied by
Cappell-Maxim-Shaneson.
  There are two versions of these characteristic classes. The K-theoretical
classes capture information about the graded pieces of the filtered de Rham
complex of the filtered D-module underlying a mixed Hodge module. Application
of a suitable Todd class transformation then gives classes in homology. These
classes are functorial for proper pushdown and exterior products, together with
some other properties one would expect for a ""good"" theory of characteristic
classes for singular spaces. For ""admissible variation of mixed Hodge
structures"" they have an explicit classical description in terms of
""logarithmic de Rham complexes"". On a point space they correspond to a
specialization of the Hodge polynomial of a mixed Hodge structure, which one
gets by forgetting the weight filtration.

\bar{B}=0.34 \muG, presumably lower than the mean field in molecular clouds.
Nonetheless, high magnetic field values are found in dense cores, in agreement
with the observations (the rms field, amplified by the turbulence, is
B_{rms}=3.05 \muG). We conclude that a strong large-scale mean magnetic field

major contributions. First, we propose a general collective inference framework
that biases data instances to agree on a set of {\em properties} of their
labelings. Agreement is encouraged through symmetric clique potentials. We show
that rich properties leads to bigger gains, and present a systematic inference
procedure for a large class of such properties. The procedure performs message
passing on the cluster graph, where property-aware messages are computed with
cluster specific algorithms. This provides an inference-only solution for
domain adaptation. Our experiments on bibliographic information extraction
illustrate significant test error reduction over unseen domains. Our second
major contribution consists of algorithms for computing outgoing messages from
clique clusters with symmetric clique potentials. Our algorithms are exact for
arbitrary symmetric potentials on binary labels and for max-like and
majority-like potentials on multiple labels. For majority potentials, we also
provide an efficient Lagrangian Relaxation based algorithm that compares
favorably with the exact algorithm. We present a 13/15-approximation algorithm
for the NP-hard Potts potential, with runtime sub-quadratic in the clique size.
In contrast, the best known previous guarantee for graphs with Potts potentials
is only 1/2. We empirically show that our method for Potts potentials is an
order of magnitude faster than the best alternatives, and our Lagrangian
Relaxation based algorithm for majority potentials beats the best applicable
heuristic -- ICM.

challenging task. Several issues need to be considered such as the existence of
multiple competing objectives and the complexity of the operating environment.
A particular challenge is posed by the various types of uncertainty that the
future might hold. It is uncertain what future events might be encountered; how
fleet design decisions will influence and shape the future; and how present and
future decision makers will act based on available information, their personal
biases regarding the importance of different objectives, and their economic
preferences. In order to assist strategic decision-making, an analysis of
future fleet options needs to account for conditions in which these different
classes of uncertainty are exposed. It is important to understand what
assumptions a particular fleet is robust to, what the fleet can readily adapt
to, and what conditions present clear risks to the fleet. We call this the
analysis of a fleet's strategic positioning. This paper introduces how
strategic positioning can be evaluated using computer simulations. Our main aim
is to introduce a framework for capturing information that can be useful to a
decision maker and for defining the concepts of robustness and adaptiveness in
the context of future fleet design. We demonstrate our conceptual framework
using simulation studies of an air transportation fleet. We capture uncertainty
by employing an explorative scenario-based approach. Each scenario represents a
sampling of different future conditions, different model assumptions, and
different economic preferences. Proposed changes to a fleet are then analysed
based on their influence on the fleet's robustness, adaptiveness, and risk to
different scenarios.

inside TiO$_2$ lattice where interlayer distances increase due to local
segregation. Au brings half-filled impurity states into the band gap leading to
metallization, in addition to other filled surface and impurity bands within
the gap. These Au-driven Fermi-level-pinning gap states are close to, or even
in some cases inside, the conduction band of the host slab. On the other hand,
if Au is substituted for the surface Ti atom, Fermi level falls lower in the
gap closer to the valence band top.

other planets, are primarily structured by circulation of the atmosphere. At
present, cloud activity mainly occurs in the southern (summer) hemisphere,
arising near the pole and at mid-latitudes from cumulus updrafts triggered by
surface heating and/or local methane sources, and at the north (winter) pole,
resulting from the subsidence and condensation of ethane-rich air into the
colder troposphere. General circulation models predict that this distribution
should change with the seasons on a 15-year timescale, and that clouds should
develop under certain circumstances at temperate latitudes (~40\degree) in the
winter hemisphere. The models, however, have hitherto been poorly constrained
and their long-term predictions have not yet been observationally verified.
Here we report that the global spatial cloud coverage on Titan is in general
agreement with the models, confirming that cloud activity is mainly controlled
by the global circulation. The non-detection of clouds at latitude ~40\degree N
and the persistence of the southern clouds while the southern summer is ending
are, however, both contrary to predictions. This suggests that Titan's
equator-to-pole thermal contrast is overestimated in the models and that its
atmosphere responds to the seasonal forcing with a greater inertia than
expected.

oscillations. However, the faintness of the target (m_v=7.65) means the
signal-to-noise (S/N) in the acoustic modes is quite low, and this low S/N
leads to complications in the analysis. Aims: To extract global variables of
the star as well as key parameters of the p modes observed in the power
spectrum of the lightcurve. Methods: The power spectrum of the lightcurve, a
wavelet transform and spot fitting have been used to obtain the average
rotation rate of the star and its inclination angle. Then, the autocorrelation
of the power spectrum and the power spectrum of the power spectrum were used to
properly determine the large separation. Finally, estimations of the mode
parameters have been done by maximizing the likelihood of a global fit, where
several modes were fit simultaneously. Results: We have been able to infer the

collected dielectric constant values for the Cassini radar wavelength ($\sim
2.2$ cm) for materials of interest for Titan: liquid methane, liquid mixture of
methane-ethane, water ice and light hydrocarbon ices. Due to the lack of
permittivity values for Titan's haze particles in the microwave range, we
performed dielectric constant ($\varepsilon_r$) measurements around 2.2 cm on
tholins synthesized in laboratory. We obtained a real part of $\varepsilon_r$
in the range of 2-2.5 and a loss tangent between $10^{-3}$ and $5.10^{-2}$. By
combining aerosol distribution models (with hypothetical condensation at low
altitudes) to surface models, we find the following results: (1) Aerosol-only
atmospheres should cause no loss and are essentially transparent for Cassini
radar, as expected by former analysis. (2) However, if clouds are present, some
atmospheric models generate significant attenuation that can reach $-50 dB$,
well below the sensitivity threshold of the receiver. In such cases, a $13.78

warn about possible risks of misinterpretation if a \textquotedblleft wet

scattering leads to a typical response of $\sim -17 dB$. These results will
have important implications on future Cassini radar data analysis.

of the basis of the cylinder, are greater than $\nu(\vec{v})+\eps$ for some
positive $\eps$, where $\nu(\vec{v})$ is the almost sure limit of the rescaled
variable $\tau_n$ when $n$ goes to infinity. On one hand, we prove that the
speed of decay of this probability in the case of the variable $\tau_n$ depends
on the tail of the distribution of the capacities of the edges: it can decays
exponentially fast with $n^{d-1}$, or with $n^{d-1} \min(n,h(n))$, or at an
intermediate regime. On the other hand, we prove that this probability in the
case of the variable $\phi_n$ decays exponentially fast with the volume of the

moment; the importance of this result is however limited by the fact that
$\nu(\vec{v})$ is not in general the almost sure limit of the rescaled maximal

when the local superfluid velocity is equal to the local sound velocity at the

dielectric properties. In the light of possible magnetoelectric coupling in
these doped ceramics, the dielectric measurements were also carried out in
external magnetic fields up to 7 T, showing a minor but significant dependence
of the dielectric constant on the applied magnetic field. Undoped CCTO is
well-known for its colossal dielectric constant in a broad frequency and
temperature range. With the present extended characterization of doped as well

0.5% Fe decreases the room-temperature dielectric constant of CCTO by a factor
of ~100 with a concomitant reduction of the conductivity, whereas 0.5% Ni
doping changes the dielectric properties only slightly. In addition,
diffraction experiments and magnetic investigations were undertaken to check
for possible correlations of the magnitude of the colossal dielectric constants

of holonomy corrections and for any arbitrary states, the matter density

follow the bouncing scenario in which two Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) solutions

H.E.S.S. data set which comprises more than twice the observation time used in
the discovery paper, allows us to test whether the VHE source may indeed be
attributed to shell-type emission from that new SNR. If true, this would make
HESS J1731-347 a new object in the small but growing class of non-thermal
shell-type supernova remnants with VHE emission.

In this framework, we report the discovery of a z~0.87 cluster and study its
properties at various wavelengths. We gathered X-ray and optical data (imaging
and spectroscopy), and near and far infrared data (imaging) in order to confirm
the cluster nature of our candidate, to determine its dynamical state, and to
give insight on its galaxy population evolution. Our candidate structure
appears to be a massive z~0.87 dynamically young cluster with an atypically
high X-ray temperature as compared to its X-ray luminosity. It exhibits a
significant percentage ~90% of galaxies that are also detected in the 24micron
band. The cluster RXJ1257.2+4738 appears to be still in the process of
collapsing. Its relatively high temperature is probably the consequence of
significant energy input into the intracluster medium besides the regular
gravitational infall contribution. A significant part of its galaxies are red
objects that are probably dusty with on-going star formation.

of an optimization problem when some of the elements that appear in the problem
are not precise. In real situations it is usual to have information, in systems
under consideration, that is not exact. Thisimprecision can be modeled in a
fuzzy environment. Zadeh (1965) analyzed systems of logic that permit truth
values between zero and one instead of the classical binary true-false logic.
In this framework, satisfying a certain condition means to evaluate how close
are the elements involved to the complete satisfaction. Then, each element in a
'fuzzy set' is coupled with a value in [0,1] that represents the membership
level to the set.
  In linear programming some or all the elements that describe a problem may be
considered fuzzy: objective function, right-hand side vector or constraint
matrix, the notion of optimality (ordering over the feasible solutions), the
level of satisfaction of the constraints, etc. Moreover, in integer programs,
the integrality constraints may be seen as fuzzy constraints.
  Here, we present new complexity results about linear integer programming
where some of its elements are considered fuzzy using previous results on short
generating functions for solving multiobjective integer programs.

characteristic time and the asymptotic packing fraction have been measured as a
function of the Bond number which is the ratio between the cohesive magnetic

different fractions of metallic beads in the pile. When the pile is only made
of metallic grains, the characteristic compaction time increases as the square
root of the Bond number. While the asymptotic packing fraction decreases as the
inverse of the Bond number. For mixtures, when the fraction of magnetized
grains in the pile is increased, the characteristic time increases while the

formation of granular chains along the magnetic field direction is proposed to
explain the observed macroscopic properties of the packings.

channel assignment to nodes: some of them use a static channel, while others
dynamically switch to neighbor channels on-demand. To assign roles and
channels, we extend the notion of the Weakly Connected Dominating Set, the

structure and introduce new constraints to define what we call a reversible
WCDS (r-WCDS), which is particularly suitable for wireless mesh networks
operating under Molecular MAC. We propose a divide-and-conquer scheme that
partitions the network into clusters with one leader per cluster solving a MILP
formulation to assign roles in its cluster. By appropriately defining the roles
at the border of clusters, we maintain global connectivity in the r-wcds.
Finally, our simulations show that the performance of the propose scheme is
close to a centralized algorithm.

The slopes of the hard X-ray spectra of Seyfert 1 and Seyfert~2 galaxies are
found to be consistent within the uncertainties, whereas higher cut-off
energies and lower luminosities are measured for the more absorbed / type 2
AGN. The intermediate Seyfert 1.5 objects exhibit hard X-ray spectra consistent
with those of Seyfert 1. When applying a Compton reflection model, the
underlying continua appear the same in Seyfert 1 and 2 with photon index 2, and
the reflection strength is about R = 1, when assuming different inclination
angles. A significant correlation is found between the hard X-ray and optical
luminosity and the mass of the central black hole in the sense that the more
luminous objects appear to be more massive. There is also a general trend
toward the absorbed sources and type 2 AGN having lower Eddington ratios. The
black holemass appears to form a fundamental plane together with the optical
and X-ray luminosity of the form Lv being proportional to Lx^0.6 M^0.2, similar
to that found between radio luminosity Lr, Lx, and M. The unified model for
Seyfert galaxies seems to hold, showing in hard X-rays that the central engine
is the same in Seyfert 1 and 2, but seen under different inclination angles and
