red-envelope galaxies. We have obtained for this purpose high-quality spectra
with the Keck-LRIS spectrograph of red-envelope galaxies in 24 galaxy clusters
in the redshift range 0.2 < z < 1.0. We complement these Keck spectra with
high-quality, publicly available archival spectra from the SPICES and VVDS
surveys. We improve over our previous expansion history measurements in Simon
et al. (2005) by providing two new determinations of the expansion history:
H(z) = 97 +- 62 km/sec/Mpc at z = 0.5 and H(z) = 90 +- 40 km/sec/Mpc at z =
0.8. We discuss the uncertainty in the expansion history determination that
arises from uncertainties in the synthetic stellar-population models. We then
use these new measurements in concert with cosmic-microwave-background (CMB)
measurements to constrain cosmological parameters, with a special emphasis on
dark-energy parameters and constraints to the curvature. In particular, we
demonstrate the usefulness of direct H(z) measurements by constraining the
dark- energy equation of state parameterized by w0 and wa and allowing for
arbitrary curvature. Further, we also constrain, using only CMB and H(z) data,
the number of relativistic degrees of freedom to be 4 +- 0.5 and their total
mass to be < 0.2 eV, both at 1-sigma.

a particular form of non-Gaussianity, such as may arise in the early Universe,
but which retains information on the nature of non-Gaussianity. In this paper
we develop the mathematical formalism for the skew spectrum of 3 different

the skew spectrum by secondary sources of CMB fluctuations. Considering the
three-point function, the study of the bispectrum provides valuable information
regarding cross-correlation of secondaries with lensing of CMB with much higher
significance compared to just the study involving CMB sky alone. We use our
analytical models to study specific cases of cosmological interest which
include cross-correlating CMB with various large scale tracers to probe ISW and

including the Ge-Se, As-Se, Ge-P-Se and Ge-As-Se systems. Special attention is
given to the As-Se binary, a system that displays a rich variety of aging
behavior intimately tied to sample synthesis conditions and the ambient
environment in which samples are aged. Calorimetric (Modulated DSC) and Raman
scattering experiments are undertaken. Our results show all samples display a
sub-Tg endotherm below Tg in glassy networks possessing a mean coordination
number r in the 2.25 < r < 2.45 range. Two sets of AsxSe1-x samples aged for 8
years were compared, set A consisted of slow cooled samples aged in the dark,
and set B consisted of melt quenched samples aged at laboratory environment.
Samples of set B in the As concentration range, 35% < x < 60%, display a pre-Tg
exotherm, but the feature is not observed in samples of set A. The aging
behavior of set A presumably represents intrinsic aging in these glasses, while
that of set B is extrinsic due to presence of light. The reversibility window
persists in both sets of samples but is less well defined in set B. These
findings contrast with a recent study by Golovchak et al., which finds the
onset of the reversibility window moved up to the stoichiometric composition (x
= 40%). Here we show that the upshifted window is better understood as
resulting due to demixing of As4Se4 and As4Se3 molecules from the backbone,
i.e., Nanoscale phase separation (NSPS). We attribute sub-Tg endotherms to
compaction of the flexible part of networks upon long term aging, while the
pre-Tg exotherm to NSPS. Finally, the narrowing and sharpening of the
reversibility window upon aging is interpreted as the slow 'self-organizing'
stress relaxation of the phases just outside the Intermediate phase.

as a consistent low energy description of a 3-brane embedded in an
asymptotically-flat (4+d)-dimensional space, the holographic scale of
high-dimensional gravity sets the strong coupling scale of the 4D theory. This
connection persists in the limit in which gravity can be consistently
decoupled. We demonstrate this effect for orbifold planes, as well as for the
solitonic branes and string theoretic D-branes. In all cases the emergence of a
4D strong coupling scale from bulk holography is a persistent phenomenon. The
effect turns out to be insensitive even to such extreme deformations of the
brane action that seemingly shield 4D theory from the bulk gravity effects. A
well understood example of such deformation is given by large 4D Einstein term
in the 3-brane action, which is known to suppress the strength of 5D gravity at
short distances and change the 5D Newton's law into the four-dimensional one.
Nevertheless, we observe that the scale at which the scalar polarization of an
effective 4D-graviton becomes strongly coupled is again set by the bulk
holographic scale. The effect persist in the gravity decoupling limit, when the
full theory reduces to a 4D system in which the only memory about the
high-dimensional holography is encoded in the strong coupling scale. The
observed intrinsic connection between the high-dimensional flat space
holography and 4D strong coupling suggests a possible guideline for
generalization of AdS/CFT duality to other systems.

$Sp_{2n-2}$ in irreducible representations of $Sp_{2n}$. Our first theorem
states that the map taking an element of $Sp_{2n}$ to its principal $n \times
(n+1)$ submatrix induces an isomorphism of $\B$ to a different branching
algebra $\B'$. The algebra $\B'$ encodes multiplicities of irreducible
representations of $GL_{n-1}$ in certain irreducible representations of
$GL_{n+1}$. Our second theorem is that each multiplicity space that arises in
the restriction of an irreducible representation of $Sp_{2n}$ to $Sp_{2n-2}$ is
canonically an irreducible module for the $n$-fold product of $SL_{2}$. In
particular, this induces a canonical decomposition of the multiplicity spaces
into one dimensional spaces, thereby resolving the multiplicities.

scaled-solar abundances of metals, choosing among various solar mixture
compilations available in the literature; ii) varying CNO abundances, suitable
for evolutionary models of red and asymptotic giant branch stars and massive
stars in the Wolf-Rayet stages; iii) various degrees of enhancement in
alpha-elements, and C-N, Na-O and Mg-Al abundance anti-correlations, necessary

nested grid simulation that covers five orders of magnitude in spatial scale
(10^4 - 0.1AU). Starting with a rotating magnetized compact cloud with a mass
of 0.22 M_sun, we follow the cloud evolution until the end of main accretion
phase. Outflow of about 5 km/s emerges about 100 yr before the protostar
formation and does not disappear until the end of the calculation. The mass
accretion rate declines from 10^-6 M_sun/yr to 10^-8 - 10^-12 M_sun/yr in a
short time (about 10^4 yr) after the protostar formation. This is because (1) a
large fraction of mass is ejected from the host cloud by the protostellar
outflow and (2) the gas escapes from the host cloud by the thermal pressure. At
the end of the calculation, 74% (167 M_Jup) of the total mass (225 M_Jup) is
outflowing from the protostar, in which 34% (77 M_Jup) of the total mass is
ejected by the protostellar outflow with supersonic velocity and 40% (90 M_Jup)
escapes with subsonic velocity. On the other hand, 20% (45 M_Jup) is converted
into the protostar and 6% (13 M_Jup) remains as the circumstellar disk. Thus,
the star formation efficiency is epsilon = 0.2. The resultant protostellar mass
is in the mass range of brown dwarfs. Our results indicate that brown dwarfs
can be formed in compact cores in the same manner as hydrogen-burning stars,
and the magnetic field and protostellar outflow are essential in determining
the star formation efficiency and stellar mass.

initial cloud shape. For different combinations of these parameters, we

during collapse, the initial angular momentum must be higher than a threshold

stars, because they carry off the excess angular momentum from the centre of

other hand, a significant fraction of stars is supposed to be born as binaries
with circumbinary disk that are frequently observed. Here, we investigate the
evolution of a magnetized rotating cloud using three-dimensional resistive MHD
nested-grid code, and show that the outflow is driven by the circumbinary disk
and has an important role even in the binary formation. After the adiabatic
core formation in the collapsing cloud core, the magnetic flux is significantly
removed from the centre of the cloud by the Ohmic dissipation. Since this
removal makes the magnetic braking ineffective, the adiabatic core continuously
acquires the angular momentum to induce fragmentation and subsequent binary
formation. The magnetic field accumulates in the circumbinary disk where the
removal and accretion of magnetic field are balanced, and finally drives
circumbinary outflow. This result explains the spectacular morphology of some
specific young stellar objects such as L1551 IRS5. We can infer that most of
the bipolar molecular outflows observed by low density tracers (i.e., CO) would
correspond to circumbinary or circum-multiple outflows found in this report,
since most of the young stellar objects are supposed to be binaries or
multiples.

of high-redshift galactic discs driven by cold streams. The fragmentation is
recovered owing to an AMR resolution better than 70 pc with cooling below 10^4
K. We study three typical star-forming galaxies in haloes of approx. 5 10^11
Msun at z=2.3, when they were not undergoing a major merger. The steady gas
supply by cold streams leads to gravitationally unstable, turbulent discs,
which fragment into giant clumps and transient features on a dynamical
timescale. The disc clumps are not associated with dark-matter haloes. The
clumpy discs are self-regulated by gravity in a marginaly unstable state. Clump
migration and angular-momentum transfer on an orbital timescale help the growth
of a central bulge with a mass comparable to the disc. The continuous gas input
keeps the system of clumpy disc and bulge in a near ""steady state"", for several
Gyr. The average star-formation rate, much of which occurs in the clumps,
follows the gas accretion rate of approx. 45 Msun/yr. The simulated galaxies
resemble in many ways the observed star-forming galaxies at high redshift.
Their properties are consistent with the simple theoretical framework presented
in Dekel, Sari & Ceverino (2009). In particular, a two-component analysis
reveals that the simulated discs are indeed marginally unstable, and the time
evolution confirms the robustness of the clumpy configuration in a cosmological
steady state. By z=1 the simulated systems are stabilized by a dominant stellar
spheroid, demonstrating the process of ""morphological quenching"" of star
formation (Martig et al. 2009) . We demonstrate that the disc fragmentation is
not a numerical artifact once the Jeans length is kept larger than 7 resolution
elements, i.e. beyond the standard Truelove criterion.

value, then there exists a unique global subsonic solution in a suitable class
for a general variable nozzle. One of the main difficulties for the general
steady Euler flows, the governing equations are a mixed elliptic-hyperbolic
system even for uniformly subsonic flows. A key point in our theory is to use a
stream function formulation for compressible Euler equations. By this
formulation, Euler equations are equivalent to a quasilinear second order
equation for a stream function so that the hyperbolicity of the particle path
is already involved. The existence of solution to the boundary value problem
for stream function is obtained with the help of the estimate for elliptic
equation of two variables. The asymptotic behavior for the stream function is
obtained via a blow up argument and energy estimates. This asymptotic behavior,
together with some refined estimates on the stream function, yields the
consistency of the stream function formulation and thus the original Euler

(and to some extent society). They are known to be more sensitive to local
symmetries than e.g. spin models. This paper concerns the evolution of the
prisoner's dilemma game on regular lattices with three different types of
neighborhoods -- the von Neumann-, Moore-, and kagome types. We investigate two
kinds of dynamics for the players to update their strategies (that can be
unconditional cooperator or defector). Depending on the payoff difference, an
individual can adopt the strategy of a random neighbor (a voter-model-like
dynamics, VMLD), or impose its strategy on a random neighbor, i.e.,
invasion-like dynamics (IPLD). In particular, we focus on the effects of noise,
in combination with the strategy dynamics, on the evolution of cooperation. We
find that VMLD, compared to IPLD, better supports the spreading and sustaining
of cooperation. We see that noise has nontrivial effects on the evolution of
cooperation: maximum cooperation density can be realized either at a medium
noise level, in the limit of zero noise, or in both these regions. The
temptation to defect and the local interaction structure determine the outcome.
Especially, in the low noise limit, the local interaction plays a crucial role
in determining the fate of cooperators. We elucidate these both by numerical
simulations and mean-field cluster approximation methods.

in many signal processing applications. The redundancy of such representations
is often directly related to the computational load of any algorithm operating
in the transform domain. To reduce complexity, it may be desirable to increase
the time and frequency sampling intervals beyond the point where the transform
is invertible, at the cost of an inevitable recovery error. In this paper we
initiate the study of recovery procedures for non-invertible Gabor
representations. We propose using fixed analysis and synthesis windows, chosen
e.g. according to implementation constraints, and to process the Gabor
coefficients prior to synthesis in order to shape the reconstructed signal. We
develop three methods to tackle this problem. The first follows from the
consistency requirement, namely that the recovered signal has the same Gabor
representation as the input signal. The second, is based on the minimization of
a worst-case error criterion. Last, we develop a recovery technique based on
the assumption that the input signal lies in some subspace of $L_2$. We show
that for each of the criteria, the manipulation of the transform coefficients
amounts to a 2D twisted convolution operation, which we show how to perform
using a filter-bank. When the under-sampling factor is an integer, the
processing reduces to standard 2D convolution. We provide simulation results to
demonstrate the advantages and weaknesses of each of the algorithms.
