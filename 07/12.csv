different flows, including laminar and turbulent ones, it is shown that
solutions expressing the field in terms of Euler potentials (EP) are in general
incorrect if the EP are evolved with an artificial diffusion term. In three
dimensions, standard methods using the magnetic vector potential are found to
permit dynamo action when the EP give decaying solutions. With an imposed
field, the EP method yields excessive power at small scales. This effect is
more exaggerated in the dynamic case, suggesting an unrealistically reduced
feedback from the Lorentz force. The EP approach agrees with standard methods
only at early times when magnetic diffusivity did not have time to act. It is
demonstrated that the usage of EP with even a small artificial magnetic
diffusivity does not converge to a proper solution of hydromagnetic turbulence.
The source of this disagreement is not connected with magnetic helicity or the
three-dimensionality of the magnetic field, but is simply due to the fact that
the nonlinear representation of the magnetic field in terms of EP that depend
on the same coordinates is incompatible with the linear diffusion operator in
the induction equation.

treat RHD feedback, we perform three-dimensional RHD simulations incorporating
the radiative transfer of ionizing photons as well as H_2 dissociating photons
from a preformed star. A collapsing gas cloud is settled at a given distance
from a 120Msun Pop III star, and the evolution of the cloud is pursued
including RHD feedback. We derive the threshold density depending on the
distance, above which the cloud can keep collapsing owing to the shielding of
H_2 dissociating radiation. We find that an H_2 shell formed ahead of an
ionizing front works effectively to shield the H_2 dissociating radiation,
leading to the positive feedback for the secondary Pop III star formation.
Also, near the threshold density, the envelope of gas cloud is stripped
significantly by a shock associated with an ionizing front. By comparing the
mass accretion timescale with the Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale, we estimate the
mass of secondary Pop III stars. It turns out that the stripping by a shock can
reduce the mass of secondary Pop III stars down to \approx 20Msum.

Cieliebak and U. Frauenfelder. Together with A. Oancea, the same authors have
recently computed the Rabinowitz-Floer homology of the cotangent disk bundle
D^*M of a closed manifold M, by establishing a long exact sequence. The first
aim of this paper is to present a chain level construction of this exact
sequence. In fact, we show that this sequence is the long homology sequence
induced by a short exact sequence of chain complexes, which involves the Morse
chain complex and the Morse differential complex of the energy functional for
closed geodesics on M. These chain maps are defined by considering spaces of
solutions of the Rabinowitz-Floer equation on half-cylinders, with suitable
boundary conditions which couple them with the negative gradient flow of the
geodesic energy functional. The second aim is to generalize this construction
to the case of a fiberwise uniformly convex compact subset W of T^*M whose
interior part contains a Lagrangian graph. Equivalently, W is the energy
sublevel associated to an arbitrary Tonelli Lagrangian L on TM and to any
energy level which is larger than the strict Mane' critical value of L. In this
case, the energy functional for closed geodesics is replaced by the free period
Lagrangian action functional associated to a suitable calibration of L. An
important issue in our analysis is to extend the uniform estimates for the
solutions of the Rabinowitz-Floer equation to Hamiltonians which have quadratic
growth in the momenta. These uniform estimates are obtained by suitable
versions of the Aleksandrov maximum principle.

evolution equation proposed long ago by this author in the framework of a fully
quantum theory of irreversibility and thermodynamics for a single isolated or
adiabatic particle, qubit, or qudit, and recently rediscovered by other
authors. The nonlinear equation generates a dynamical group, not just a
semigroup, providing a deterministic description of irreversible conservative
relaxation towards equilibrium from any non-equilibrium density operator. It
satisfies a very restrictive stability requirement equivalent to the
Hatsopoulos-Keenan statement of the second law of thermodynamics. We then
examine the form of the evolution equation we proposed to describe multipartite
isolated or adiabatic systems. This hinges on novel nonlinear projections
defining local operators that we interpret as ``local perceptions'' of the
overall system's energy and entropy. Each component particle contributes an
independent local tendency along the direction of steepest increase of the
locally perceived entropy at constant locally perceived energy. It conserves
both the locally-perceived energies and the overall energy, and meets strong
separability and non-signaling conditions, even though the local evolutions are
not independent of existing correlations. We finally show how the geometrical
construction can readily lead to other thermodynamically relevant models, such
as of the nonunitary isoentropic evolution needed for full extraction of a
system's adiabatic availability.

nonuniversal coupling of neutrinos to a torsion field. We conclude that this
extra phase contribution only becomes observable, in the best case, at energies
greater than 10^{16.5} GeV, which is about five orders of magnitude higher than
the most energetic cosmological neutrinos to be detected in the near future.
Therefore, if these effects are present only in the oscillation phase, they are
going to be unobservable, unless a new mechanism or source capable to produce

obtain the excess entropy production for a surface. Following the traditional
non-equilibrium thermodynamic approach we introduce the surface transfer
coefficients which we are able to determine from the continuous solution. The
knowledge of these coefficients is important for many industrial applications
which involve transport through a surface, such as for instance distillation.
In our approach the values of the local resistivities in the liquid and the
vapor phases are chosen on the basis of experimental values. In the interfacial
region there are small peaks in these resistivities. Three amplitudes control
the magnitude of these peaks. Possible values of these amplitudes are found by
matching the diagonal transfer coefficients to values predicted by kinetic
theory. Using these amplitudes we find that the value of the cross
resistivities is 1-2 orders of magnitude higher then the one from kinetic
theory. The results of both kinetic theory and molecular dynamics simulations
support the existence of small peaks in the local resistivities in the
interfacial region. The square gradient approach gives an independent way to
determine the transfer coefficients for surfaces. The results indicate that
kinetic theory underestimates the interfacial transfer coefficients in real

for which the frequencies of the oscillations are known to be independent of
background density and interaction strengths, we find that in the presence of a
cubic-quintic nonlinearity an explicit dependence of the oscillations frequency
on the above quantities appears. This dependence gives rise to the possibility
of measuring these quantities directly from the dark soliton dynamics, or to
manage the oscillation via the changes of the scattering lengths by means of
Feshbach resonance. A comparison between analytical results and direct
numerical simulations of the cubic-quintic Gross-Pitaevskii equation shows good
agreement which confirms the validity of our approach.

second moment $\sigma^{2}$ can produce different total splittings $\Delta E$
magnitudes. Based on the numerical data on crystal-field splittings for the
representative sets of crystal-field Hamiltonians ${\cal H}_{\rm
CF}=\sum_{k}\sum_{q}B_{kq}C_{q}^{(k)}$ with fixed indexes either $k$ or $q$,
the potentials leading to the extreme $\Delta E$ have been identified. For all
crystal-fields the admissible ranges $(\Delta E_{min},\Delta E_{max})$ have
been found numerically for $1\leq J\leq 8$. The extreme splittings are reached
in the crystal-fields for which ${\cal H}_{\rm CF}s$ are the definite
superpositions of the $C_{q}^{(k)}$ components with different rank $k=2,4$ and
6 and the same index $q$. Apart from few exceptions, the lower limits $\Delta
E_{min}$ occur in the axial fields of ${\cal H}_{\rm
CF}(q=0)=B_{20}C_{0}^{(2)}+B_{40}C_{0}^{(4)}+B_{60}C_{0}^{(6)}$, whereas the
upper limits $\Delta E_{max}$ in the low symmetry fields of ${\cal H}_{\rm

${\cal H}_{\rm CF}$ components with different $q$ yields a secondary effect and
does not determine the extreme splittings. The admissible $\Delta E_{min}$
changes with $J$ from $2.00\sigma$ to $2.40\sigma$, whereas the $\Delta
E_{max}$ from $2.00\sigma$ to $4.10\sigma$. The maximal gap $\Delta
E_{max}-\Delta E_{min}=2.00\sigma$ has been found for the states $|J=4>$. Not
all the nominally allowed total splittings, preserving $\sigma^{2}=const$
condition, are physically available, and in consequence not all virtual

(CR) systems to operate in the spectrum white space. To protect the primary
incumbent users from interference, the CR is required to detect incumbent
signals at very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this paper, we present a
spectrum sensing technique based on correlating spectra for detection of
television (TV) broadcasting signals. The basic strategy is to correlate the
periodogram of the received signal with the a priori known spectral features of
the primary signal. We show that according to the Neyman-Pearson criterion,
this spectral correlation-based sensing technique is asymptotically optimal at
very low SNR and with a large sensing time. From the system design perspective,
we analyze the effect of the spectral features on the spectrum sensing
performance. Through the optimization analysis, we obtain useful insights on
how to choose effective spectral features to achieve reliable sensing.
Simulation results show that the proposed sensing technique can reliably detect
analog and digital TV signals at SNR as low as -20 dB.

start with an ordinary configuration manifold of human body motion, given as a
set of its all active degrees of freedom (DOF) for a particular movement. This
is a Riemannian manifold with a material metric tensor given by the total
mass-inertia matrix of the human body segments. This is the base manifold for
standard autonomous biomechanics. To make its time-dependent generalization, we
need to extend it with a real time axis. By this extension, using techniques
from fibre bundles, we defined the biomechanical configuration bundle. On the
biomechanical bundle we define vector-fields, differential forms and affine
connections, as well as the associated jet manifolds. Using the formalism of
jet manifolds of velocities and accelerations, we develop the time-dependent

physiological conditions. By choosing specific regulatory interactions with up
to three transcription factors, we designed several functional motifs, each of
which is shown to perform a certain function and can be integrated into larger
networks. We analyzed three kinds of networks: (i) Motifs derived from
incoherent feedforward motifs, which behave as `amplitude filters', or
`concentration detectors'. These motifs respond maximally to input
transcription factors with concentrations within a certain range. From these
motifs homeostatic and pulse generating networks are derived. (ii) Tunable
network motifs, which can behave as oscillators or switches for low and high
concentrations of an input transcription factor, respectively. (iii)
Transcription factor controlled adjustable gates, which switch between AND/OR
gate characteristics, depending on the concentration of the input transcription
factor. This study has demonstrated the utility of feedforward networks and the
flexibility of specific transcriptional binding kinetics in generating new
novel behaviors. The flexibility of feedforward networks as dynamic units may
explain the apparent frequency that such motifs are found in real biological

Ha, [N II]6583, and [S II]6716,6731 images, as well as those line ratio maps.
The [N II]/Ha ratio in the galactic wind region is larger than those in H II
regions in the galactic disk. The [N II]/Ha ratio in the southeastern filament,
a part of the galactic wind, is the largest and reaches about 1.5. These large
[N II]/Ha ratios are explained by shock ionization/excitation. Using the [S
II]/Ha ratio map, we spatially separate the galactic wind region from the
starburst region. The kinetic energy of the galactic wind can be sufficiently
supplied by supernovae in a starburst region in the galactic center. The shape
of the galactic wind and the line ratio maps are non-axisymmetric about the
galactic minor axis, which is also seen in M82. In the [N II]6583/[S

of star clusters found in the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observation. This
means that intense star formation causes strong nitrogen enrichment in these

regions and starburst regions, determining the extent of galactic wind and its
mass and kinetic energy, and discovering regions with enhanced nitrogen

the shock velocities range between 65 and 80 km/s, the pre-shock densities
between 1 cm-3 in the ISM to 200 cm-3 in the filamentary structures. The
pre-shock magnetic field increases from 5. 10^{-6} gauss in the surrounding ISM
to ~8. 10^{-5} gauss in the Arched Filaments. The stellar temperatures are
~38000 K in the Quintuplet cluster and ~27000 K in the Arches Cluster. The
ionization parameter is relatively low (<0.01) with the highest values near the
clusters, reaching a maximum >0.01 near the Arches Cluster. Depletion from the
gaseous phase of Si is found throughout the whole observed region, indicating
the presence of silicate dust. Grains including iron, are concentrated
throughout the Arched Filaments. The modelling of the continuum SED in the IR
range, indicates that a component of dust at temperatures of ~100-200 K is
present in the central region of the Galaxy. Radio emission appears to be
thermal bremsstrahlung in the E2-W1 filaments crossing strip, however a
synchrotron component is not excluded. More data are necessary to resolve this

Cyg has been through in the course of our observations. During quiescence, the
strength of the line profiles changes in opposite phase with the star's
luminosity. The H alpha profile becomes double-peaked at times, which may point
to the temporary presence of some disk-like structure, but also to absorption
in neutral gas surrounding the area of the formation of the emission component.
In 1999, when a periastron passage is assumed according to the 5700-day model,
the Balmer lines strengthen considerably, as might be expected due to an
increase in the accretion rate. The eclipse in 2001, however, is not noticed.

the study of electron dynamics in the presence of electromagnetic fields and

it for almost any choice of $\phi_{1}$ and $\phi_{2}$, provided $p$ and $q$ are

on mathematically grounded techniques such as the B method. Such techniques
consist in the successive applications of refinements to derive a concrete
implementation from an abstract specification. Refinement theory defines
verification conditions to guarantee that such operations preserve the intended
behaviour of the abstract specifications. One of these conditions requires
however that concrete operations have exactly the same signatures as their
abstract counterpart, which is not always a practical requirement. This paper
shows how changes of signatures can be achieved while still staying within the
bounds of refinement theory. This makes it possible to take advantage of the
mathematical guarantees and tool support provided for the current
refinement-based techniques, such as the B method.

chromatic expansions and provides an appropriate motivation for introducing
these notions. Chromatic derivatives are special, numerically robust linear
differential operators which correspond to certain families of orthogonal
polynomials. Chromatic expansions are series of the corresponding special
functions, which possess the best features of both the Taylor and the Shannon
expansions. This makes chromatic derivatives and chromatic expansions
applicable in fields involving empirically sampled data, such as digital signal
and image processing. The first section of this paper is a 2 page extended
abstract.

  junctions","9 pages, 13 figures",,,,"cond-mat.supr-con cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the Josephson effect and pairing correlations in SFFS junctions that
consist of conventional superconductors (S) connected through two metallic
monodomain ferromagnets (F) with transparent and spin inactive interfaces. We
solve the Eilenberger equations for arbitrary relative orientation of
magnetizations of the two F layers in the clean limit and for moderate disorder
in ferromagnets. Spatial variation of pair amplitudes, singlet $f_s$, and odd
in frequency triplet $f_{t0}$ and $f_{t1}$, with 0 and $\pm1$ spin projections,
as well as the Josephson current-phase relations are calculated for different
values of the ferromagnetic layers thickness and angle $\alpha$ between
in-plane magnetizations. In contrast to the dirty limit case, we find that for
$0<\alpha<\pi$ both spin singlet and triplet pair amplitudes in F layers
power-law decay in the same oscillatory manner with distance from the FS
interfaces. This decay gets faster as the impurity-scattering rate in
ferromagnets is increased. The computed triplet amplitude $f_{t1}$ has opposite
signs in the two magnet regions, penetrates into the superconductors and
monotonically decays over the same distance, which is the superconducting
coherence length, as the singlet amplitude $f_s$ saturates to the bulk value.
We point out that influence of misorientation of magnetizations on the
Josephson current can not be attributed directly to the appearance of odd
triplet correlations.

with the presence of the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at the -308
position of the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-$\alpha$) gene. We also
consider the influence of the occurrence of type 2 diabetes (t2DM). Using
Bayesian inference, we first pursue a bottom-up approach to compute the working
hypothesis and the probabilities derivable from the data. We then pursue a
top-down approach by modelling the signal pathway that causally connects the
SNP with the emergence of CHD. We compute the functional form of the
probability of CHD conditional on the presence of the SNP in terms of both the
statistical and biochemical properties of the system. From the probability of
occurrence of a disease conditional on a given risk factor, we explore the
possibility of extracting information on the pathways involved in the
occurrence of the disease. This is a first study that we want to systematise
into a comprehensive formalism to be applied to the inference of the mechanism
connecting the risk factors to the disease.

systems is done with pre-determined single-particle Wannier functions, ignoring
the dependence of the Wannier function on interaction. We show that the
single-band approximation has to be done self-consistently to properly account
the interaction effect on the Wannier functions. This self-consistent
single-band approximation leads to a nonlinear equation for Wannier functions,
which can be recast into a set of nonlinear equations for Bloch functions.
These equations are simplified for two special cases, the superfluid regime and
deep in the Mott insulator regime. A simple example with double-well potential
is used to illustrate our results.

This paper deals with the determination of the subalgebra structure of the
algebra T by analyzing the loop T_L of order 64 generated by its 32 basis
elements. The analysis shows that T_L is a non-associative finite invertible
loop (NAFIL) with 373 non-trivial subloops of orders 32, 16, 8, 4, and 2 all of
which are normal. These subloops generate subalgebras of T of dimensions 16, 8,
