means to study rotation, outflow, and infall at the onset of massive star
formation. Submillimeter Array observations combined with IRAM 30 meter data in
12CO(2--1) reveal the outflow orientation in the IRDC 18223-3 region, and PdBI
3 mm observations confirm this orientation in other molecular species. The
implication of the outflow's presence is that an accretion disk is feeding it,
so using high density tracers such as C18O, N2H+, and CH3OH, we looked for
indications of a velocity gradient perpendicular to the outflow direction.
Surprisingly, this gradient turns out to be most apparent in CH3OH. The large
size (28,000 AU) of the flattened rotating object detected indicates that this
velocity gradient cannot be due solely to a disk, but rather from inward
spiraling gas within which a Keplerian disk likely exists. From the outflow
parameters, we derive properties of the source such as an outflow dynamical age
of ~37,000 years, outflow mass of ~13 M_sun, and outflow energy of ~1.7 x 10^46
erg. While the outflow mass and energy are clearly consistent with a high-mass
star forming region, the outflow dynamical age indicates a slightly more
evolved evolutionary stage than previous spectral energy distribution (SED)
modeling indicates. The calculated outflow properties reveal that this is truly
a massive star in the making. We also present a model of the observed methanol
velocity gradient. The rotational signatures can be modeled via rotationally
infalling gas. These data present evidence for one of the youngest known
outflow/infall/disk systems in massive star formation. A tentative evolutionary
picture for massive disks is discussed.

detected in a 500 kton water Cerenkov detector at a distance L=650 km (first
oscillation peak) from the source. Neutrinos from 8B and 8Li are detected in a
50 kton magnetized iron detector at a distance L=7000 km (magic baseline) from
the source. Since the decay ring requires a tilt angle of 34.5 degrees to send
the beam to the magic baseline, the far end of the ring has a maximum depth of
d=2132 m for magnetic field strength of 8.3 T, if one demands that the fraction
of ions that decay along the straight sections of the racetrack geometry decay
ring (called livetime) is 0.3. We alleviate this problem by proposing to trade
reduction of the livetime of the decay ring with the increase in the boost
factor of the ions, such that the number of events at the detector remains
almost the same. This allows to substantially reduce the maximum depth of the
decay ring at the far end, without significantly compromising the sensitivity
of the experiment to the oscillation parameters. We take 8B and 8Li with
gamma=390 and 656 respectively, as these are the largest possible boost factors
possible with the envisaged upgrades of the SPS at CERN. This allows us to
reduce d of the decay ring by a factor of 1.7 for 8.3 T magnetic field.
Increase of magnetic field to 15 T would further reduce d to 738 m only. We
study the sensitivity reach of this two baseline two storage ring Beta-Beam
experiment, and compare it with the corresponding reach of the other proposed
facilities.

of (in general) weighted, directed internodal flows to bistochastic
(doubly-stochastic) form, using the iterative proportional fitting
(Sinkhorn-Knopp) procedure, which alternatively scales row and column sums to
all equal 1. The dominant entries in the bistochasticized table can then be
employed for network reduction, using strong component hierarchical clustering.
We illustrate various facets of this well-established, widely-applied two-stage
algorithm with the 3, 107 x 3, 107 (asymmetric) 1995-2000 intercounty migration
flow table for the United States. We compare the results obtained with ones
using the disparity filter, for ""extracting the ""multiscale backbone of complex
weighted networks"", recently put forth by Serrano, Boguna and Vespignani (SBV)
(Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 106 [2009], 6483), upon which we have briefly commented
(Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 106 [2009], E66). The performance of the bistochastic
filter appears to be superior-at least in this specific case-in two respects:
(1) it requires far fewer links to complete a stongly-connected network
backbone; and (2) it ""belittles"" small flows and nodes less-a principal
desideratum of SBV-in the sense that the correlations of the nonzero raw flows
are considerably weaker with the corresponding bistochastized links than with
the significance levels yielded by the disparity filter. Additional comparative
studies--as called for by SBV-of these two filtering procedures, in particular
as regards their topological properties, should be of considerable interest.
Relatedly, in its many geographic applications, the two-stage procedure
has--with rare exceptions-clustered contiguous areas, often reconstructing
traditional regions (islands, for example), even though no contiguity

and serves a wide variety of practical applications in processes such as
enhanced oil recovery from underground reservoirs, filtration of polymer
solutions and soil remediation through the removal of liquid pollutants. These
fluids occur in diverse natural and synthetic forms and can be regarded as the
rule rather than the exception. They show very complex strain and time
dependent behavior and may have initial yield-stress. Their common feature is
that they do not obey the simple Newtonian relation of proportionality between
stress and rate of deformation. Non-Newtonian fluids are generally classified
into three main categories: time-independent whose strain rate solely depends
on the instantaneous stress, time-dependent whose strain rate is a function of
both magnitude and duration of the applied stress and viscoelastic which shows
partial elastic recovery on removal of the deforming stress and usually
demonstrates both time and strain dependency. In this article the key aspects
of these fluids are reviewed with particular emphasis on single-phase flow
through porous media. The four main approaches for describing the flow in
porous media are examined and assessed. These are: continuum models, bundle of
tubes models, numerical methods and pore-scale network modeling.

related to the active nucleus, the other zone is extended and is located in the

dynamical equinox of J2000; and realized by a list of adopted coordinates of
extragalatic sources. Starting from the updated and presumably complete LQAC

USNO B1.0 and GSC2.3 catalogs, and from the SDSS DR5. The initial positions are
next placed onto UCAC2-based reference frames, following by an alignment with
the ICRF, to which were added the most precise sources from the VLBA calibrator
list and the VLA calibrator list - when reliable optical counterparts exist.
Finally, the LQRF axes are inspected through spherical harmonics, contemplating
to define right ascension, declination and magnitude terms. The LQRF contains
J2000 referred equatorial coordinates for 100,165 quasars, well represented
across the sky, from -83.5 to +88.5 degrees in declination, and with 10 arcmin
being the average distance between adjacent elements. The global alignment with
the ICRF is 1.5 mas, and the individual position accuracies are represented by
a Poisson distribution that peaks at 139 mas in right ascension and 130 mas in
declination. It is complemented by redshift and photometry information from the
LQAC. The LQRF is designed to be an astrometric frame, but it is also the basis
for the GAIA mission initial quasars' list, and can be used as a test bench for
quasars' space distribution and luminosity function studies.

on--site/inter--site pairing coexists with repulsive pair hopping interaction.
The latter interaction is interesting in that it leads to pairing with nonzero
momentum of the Cooper pairs even in the absence of the external magnetic field
(the so-called eta-pairing). It turns out that depending on the strength of the
pair hopping interaction the magnetic field can induce one of two types of the
FFLO phase with different spatial modulations of the order parameter. It is
argued that the properties of the FFLO phase may give information about the
magnitude of the pair hopping interaction. We also show that eta-pairing and
d-wave superconductivity may coexist in the FFLO state. It holds true also for
superconductors which in the absence of magnetic field are of pure d-wave type.

the stellar radius and luminosity as a function of distance. By assuming that
the supergiant rotates synchronously with the orbit, we can use the radius -

Our model considers the organic solar cell as device with carrier concentration

a solar cell is higher at the cathode than at the anode, and vice versa for
holes. Therefore, the spatially dependent bimolecular recombination rate,
proportional to the local product of electron and hole concentration, is much
lower as compared to the calculation of the recombination rate based on the
extracted and thus averaged charge carrier concentrations. We consider also the
temperature dependence of the recombination rate, which can for the first time

Rev. Lett. 96, 207802
(2006)] that isolated, square-well homopolymers can spontaneously break chiral
symmetry and freeze into helical structures at sufficiently low temperatures.
This behavior is interesting because the square-well homopolymer is itself
achiral. In this work, we use event-driven molecular dynamics, combined with an
optimized parallel tempering scheme, to study this polymer model over a wide
range of parameters. We examine the conditions where the helix structure is
stable and determine how the interaction parameters of the polymer govern the
details of the helix structure. The width of the square well (proportional to
lambda) is found to control the radius of the helix, which decreases with
increasing well width until the polymer forms a coiled sphere for sufficiently
large wells. The helices are found to be stable for only a window of molecular
weights. If the polymer is too short, the helix will not form. If the polymer
is too long, the helix is no longer the minimum energy structure, and other
folded structures will form. The size of this window is governed by the chain
stiffness, which in this model is a function of the ratio of the monomer size
to the bond length. Outside this window, the polymer still freezes into a
locked structure at low temperature, however, unless the chain is sufficiently
stiff, this structure will not be unique and is similar to a glassy state.

in non-linear QCD by allowing for the recombination of low-$x$ gluons until
saturation of gluon densities occurs. Understanding saturation is an important
goal not just for QCD in general, but also in understanding the initial

avoid many of the properties that make optimal mechanisms impractical.

unidirectional motion although the spatial average of the force vanishes. The
amplitude of the oscillations is much smaller than the period of $f(x)$. In
order to find out for which regions the above solutions are stable, we
calculate the time evolution of the soliton momentum $P(t)$ and soliton
velocity $V(t)$: This is a parameter representation of a curve $P(V)$ which is
visited by the soliton while time evolves. Our conjecture is that the soliton
becomes unstable, if this curve has a branch with negative slope. This
conjecture is fully confirmed by our simulations for the perturbed NLSE.
Moreover, this curve also yields a good estimate for the soliton lifetime: the
soliton lives longer, the shorter the branch with negative slope is.

momentum dependence of the trispectra coming from the adiabatic, mixed and
purely entropic contributions separately and we find that they have different
momentum dependence. This means that if the amount of the transfer from the
entropy perturbations to the curvature perturbation is significantly large, the
trispectrum can distinguish multi-field DBI inflation models from single field
DBI inflation models. A large amount of transfer $T_{\mathcal{RS}} \gg 1 $
suppresses the tensor to scalar ratio $r \propto T_{\mathcal{RS}}^{-2}$ and the
amplitude of the bispectrum $f_{NL}^{equi} \propto T_{\mathcal{RS}}^{-2}$ and
so it can ease the severe observational constraints on the DBI inflation model
based on string theory. On the other hand, it enhances the amplitude of the
trispectrum $\tau_{NL}^{equi} \propto T_{\mathcal{RS}}^2 f_{NL}^{equi 2}$ for a

X which is naturally identified at short distances. This allows us to exactly
compute the IR behavior of some correlation functions even in strongly coupled

At energies below the superpartners' scale, fermions, scalars (including

nearby Universe and their origin is one of the outstanding puzzles of how
galaxies form. Dwarf spheroidals are poor in gas and stars, making them
unusually faint, and those known as ultra-faint dwarfs have by far the lowest
measured stellar content of any galaxy. Previous theories require that dwarf
spheroidals orbit near giant galaxies like the Milky Way, but some dwarfs have
been observed in the outskirts of the Local Group. Here we report simulations
of encounters between dwarf disk galaxies and somewhat larger objects. We find
that the encounters excite a process, which we term ``resonant stripping'',
that can transform them into dwarf spheroidals. This effect is distinct from
other mechanisms proposed to form dwarf spheroidals, including mergers,
galaxy-galaxy harassment, or tidal and ram pressure stripping, because it is
driven by gravitational resonances. It may account for the observed properties
of dwarf spheroidals in the Local Group, including their morphologies and
kinematics. Resonant stripping predicts that dwarf spheroidals should form
through encounters, leaving detectable long stellar streams and tails.

Fermi-surface consists of points, and divergences associated with low-energy
particle-hole excitations abound when electron-electron interactions are
described perturbatively. In higher space dimensions, the corresponding
divergences occur only when Fermi lines or surfaces satisfy idealized nesting
conditions. In this article we discuss electron-electron interactions in 2D
graphene bilayer systems which behave in many ways as if they were
one-dimensional, because they have Fermi points instead of Fermi lines and
because their particle-hole energies have a quadratic dispersion which
compensates for the difference between 1D and 2D phase space. We conclude, on

C*-categories M with conjugates and irreducible tensor unit. No assumption on
the existence of a braided symmetry or on amenability is made. Our assumptions
are motivated by the remark that these categories often contain non-full tensor
C*-subcategories with conjugates and the same objects admitting an embedding
into the Hilbert spaces. Such an embedding defines a compact quantum group by
Woronowicz duality. An important example is the Temperley--Lieb category
canonically contained in a tensor C*-category generated by a single real or
pseudoreal object of dimension bigger than 2. The associated quantum groups are
the universal orthogonal quantum groups of Wang and Van Daele. Our main result
asserts that there is a full and faithful tensor functor from M to a category
of Hilbert bimodule representations of the compact quantum group. In the
classical case, these bimodule representations reduce to the G-equivariant
Hermitian bundles over compact homogeneous G-spaces, with G a compact group.
Our structural results shed light on the problem of whether there is an
embedding functor of M into the Hilbert spaces. We show that this is related to
the problem of whether a classical compact Lie group can act ergodically on a
non-type I von Neumann algebra. In particular, combining this with a result of
Wassermann shows that an embedding exists if M is generated by a pseudoreal
object of dimension 2.

throughout the literature, and include such diverse examples as symmetric
multicategories, globular operads, Lawvere theories, and topological spaces. In
each case, generalized multicategories are defined as the ""lax algebras"" or
""Kleisli monoids"" relative to a ""monad"" on a bicategory. However, the meanings
of these words differ from author to author, as do the specific bicategories
considered. We propose a unified framework: by working with monads on double
categories and related structures (rather than bicategories), one can define
generalized multicategories in a way that unifies all previous examples, while
at the same time simplifying and clarifying much of the theory.

extragalactic giant magnetar flare by virtue of its proximity on the sky to
M81/M82, as well as its time history, localization, and energy spectrum. We
have derived a refined interplanetary network localization for this burst which
reduces the size of the error box by over a factor of two. We examine its time
history for evidence of a periodic component, which would be one signature of
an SGR giant flare, and conclude that this component is neither detected nor
detectable under reasonable assumptions. We analyze the time-resolved energy
spectra of this event with improved time- and energy resolution, and conclude
that although the spectrum is very hard, its temporal evolution at late times
cannot be determined, which further complicates the giant flare association. We
also present new optical observations reaching limiting magnitudes of R > 24.5,
about 4 magnitudes deeper than previously reported. In tandem with
serendipitous observations of M81 taken immediately before and one month after
the burst, these place strong constraints on any rapidly variable sources in
the region of the refined error ellipse proximate to M81. We do not find any
convincing afterglow candidates from either background galaxies or sources in
M81, although within the refined error region we do locate two UV bright star
forming regions which may host SGRs. A supernova remnant (SNR) within the error
ellipse could provide further support for an SGR giant flare association, but
we were unable to identify any SNR within the error ellipse. These data still
do not allow strong constraints on the nature of the GRB 051103 progenitor, and
suggest that candidate extragalactic SGR giant flares will be difficult,
although not impossible, to confirm.

  Syjmposium 261. Additions from comments of referees and colleagues",,,"LA-UR-09-04334","gr-qc","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","  There are at least four unexplained anomalies connected with astrometric
data. Perhaps the most disturbing is the fact that when a spacecraft on a flyby
trajectory approaches the Earth within 2000 km or less, it often experiences a
change in total orbital energy per unit mass. Next, a secular change in the
astronomical unit AU is definitely a concern. It is increasing by about 15 cm
yr$^{-1}$. The other two anomalies are perhaps less disturbing because of known
sources of nongravitational acceleration. The first is an apparent slowing of
the two Pioneer spacecraft as they exit the solar system in opposite
directions. Some astronomers and physicists are convinced this effect is of
concern, but many others are convinced it is produced by a nearly identical
thermal emission from both spacecraft, in a direction away from the Sun,
thereby producing acceleration toward the Sun. The fourth anomaly is a measured
increase in the eccentricity of the Moon's orbit. Here again, an increase is
expected from tidal friction in both the Earth and Moon. However, there is a
reported unexplained increase that is significant at the three-sigma level. It
is prudent to suspect that all four anomalies have mundane explanations, or
that one or more anomalies are a result of systematic error. Yet they might
eventually be explained by new physics. For example, a slightly modified theory
of gravitation is not ruled out, perhaps analogous to Einstein's 1916
explanation for the excess precession of Mercury's perihelion.

  Multilevel models perform partial pooling (shifting estimates toward each

Community Cloud Computing (C3) offers an alternative architecture, created by
combing the Cloud with paradigms from Grid Computing, principles from Digital

the original vision of the Internet. It is more technically challenging than
Cloud Computing, having to deal with distributed computing issues, including

contributes at the same order $O(\alpha_{s}^{-2})$ in perturbative QCD. Using
the Gunion-Bertsch formula for the gg<->ggg matrix element which is valid for
the limit of soft bremsstrahlung, we find that the result is sensitive to
whether the same limit is taken for the phase space. Using the exact phase
space, the gg<->ggg contribution becomes more important to $\eta$ than gg->gg
for $\alpha_{s}\gtrsim 2\times 10^{-3}$. Therefore, at $\alpha_{s}=0.1$, $\eta
/s\simeq 1.0$, between 2.7 obtained by Arnold, Moore and Yaffe (AMY) and 0.5
obtained by Xu and Greiner. If the soft bremsstrahlung limit is imposed on the
phase space such that the recoil effect from the bremsstrahlung gluon is
neglected, then the correction from the gg<->ggg process is about 10-30% of the
total which is close to AMY's prediction. This shows that the soft
bremsstrahlung approximation is not as good as previously expected.

fundamental problems in the philosophy and natural history of mind are these:
1. how does mind act on matter? 2. If mind does not act on matter is mind a
mere epiphenomenon? 3. What might be the source of free will? 4. What might be
the source of a responsible free will? 5. Why might it have been selectively
advantageous to evolve consciousness? 6. What is consciousness? I approach the
first five of the above six problems based on two physical postulates. First
the mind-brain system is a quantum coherent, but reversibly decohering and
recohering system. This allows me to answer 1) above, mind does not act
causally on brain at all, rather it acausally decohers to classicity (for all
practical purposes), hence has consequences for brain and body as matter.
Epiphenomenalism is averted. A quantum mind, because it is acausal on
Copenhagen including Born, yields a free will, but a merely random free will,
not a responsible free will. Second, the most radical part of this article
proposes that the quantum classical interface is not always describable by a
law: specifically in a special relativity setting, no function, F, maps the
present state of the system mind-brain into its future. In its place is a
nonrandom yet lawless process. I seek in this non-random yet lawless process a
source for a responsible free will. Finally, if the quantum-classical boundary
can be non-random yet lawless, then no algorithmic simulation of the world or
ourselves can calculate the real world, hence the evolutionary selective
advantages for evolving consciousness to know it may be great. I make no
progress on problem 6, the hard problem of qualia.

noises converges in law, in the space $\mathcal{C}([0,T]\times [0,1])$ of
continuous functions, to the solution of the white noise driven SPDE. Making
use of a suitable continuous functional of the stochastic convolution term, we
show that it suffices to tackle the linear problem. For this, we prove that the
corresponding family of laws is tight and we identify the limit law by showing
the convergence of the finite dimensional distributions. We have also
considered two particular families of noises to that our result applies. The
first one involves a Poisson process in the plane and has been motivated by a
one-dimensional result of Stroock, which states that the family of processes $n
\int_0^t (-1)^{N(n^2 s)} ds$, where $N$ is a standard Poisson process,
converges in law to a Brownian motion. The second one is constructed in terms
of the kernels associated to the extension of Donsker's theorem to the plane.

one of the fundamental issues in network information theory. The problem is,
however, quite challenging due to inter-user interference when there exist
multiple source--destination (S--D) pairs in the network. By focusing on a
special class of networks, we show that the capacity can be found. Namely, we
study a layered linear binary field network with time-varying channels, which
is a simplified model reflecting broadcast, interference, and fading natures of
wireless communications. We observe that fading can play an important role in
mitigating inter-user interference effectively for both single-hop and
multi-hop networks. We propose new encoding and relaying schemes with
randomized channel pairing, which exploit such channel variations, and derive
their achievable rates. By comparing them with the cut-set upper bound, the
capacity region of single-hop networks and the sum capacity of multi-hop
networks can be characterized for some classes of channel distributions and
network topologies. For these classes, we show that the capacity region or sum
capacity can be interpreted as the max-flow min-cut theorem.

conducting coagulation simulations in which the planetesimals grow by mutual

objects with a SFD that is consistent with asteroid belt constraints. We find
that, if the initial planetesimals were small (e.g. km-sized), the final SFD
fails to fulfill these constraints. In particular, reproducing the bump
observed at diameter D~100km in the current SFD of the asteroids requires that
the minimal size of the initial planetesimals was also ~100km. This supports
the idea that planetesimals formed big, namely that the size of solids in the
proto-planetary disk ``jumped'' from sub-meter scale to multi-kilometer scale,
without passing through intermediate values. Moreover, we find evidence that
the initial planetesimals had to have sizes ranging from 100 to several 100km,
probably even 1,000km, and that their SFD had to have a slope over this
interval that was similar to the one characterizing the current asteroids in
the same size-range. This result sets a new constraint on planetesimal

emission in X-rays, also probably of synchrotron origin. Such emission results
from electrons/positrons accelerated well above TeV energies in the spectral
cut-off regime. In the case of diffusive shock acceleration, which is the most
promising acceleration mechanism in SNRs, very strong magnetic fluctuations
with amplitudes well above the mean magnetic field must be present. Starting
from such a fluctuating field, we have simulated images of polarized X-ray
emission of SNR shells and show that these are highly clumpy with high
polarizations up to 50%. Another distinct characteristic of this emission is
the strong intermittency, resulting from the fluctuating field amplifications.
The details of this ""twinkling"" polarized X-ray emission of SNRs depend
strongly on the magnetic-field fluctuation spectra, providing a potentially
sensitive diagnostic tool. We demonstrate that the predicted characteristics

of star formation and galaxy building. Studies of extragalactic GC systems
using deep, high-quality imaging have revealed a small but significant slope to
the color-magnitude relation for metal-poor GCs in a number of galaxies. We
present a study of the M87 GC system using deep, archival HST/ACS imaging with
the F606W and F814W filters, in which we find a significant color-magnitude
relation for the metal-poor GCs. The slope of this relation in the I vs. V-I
color-magnitude diagram ($\gamma_I=-0.024\pm0.006$) is perfectly consistent
with expectations based on previously published results using data from the ACS
Virgo Cluster Survey. The relation is driven by the most luminous GCs, those
with $M_I<-10$, and its significance is largest when fitting metal-poor GCs
brighter than $M_I=-7.8$, a luminosity which is ~1 mag fainter than our fitted
Gaussian mean for the luminosity function (LF) of blue, metal-poor GCs (~0.8
mag fainter than the mean for all GCs). These results indicate that there is a
mass scale at which the correlation begins, and is consistent with a scenario
where self-enrichment drives a mass-metallicity relationship. We show that
previously measured half-light radii of M87 GCs from best-fit PSF-convolved
King models are consistent with the more accurate measurements in this study,
and we also explain how the color-magnitude relation for metal-poor GCs is real
and cannot be an artifact of the photometry. We fit Gaussian and evolved
Schechter functions to the luminosity distribution of GCs across all colors, as
well as divided into blue and red subpopulations, finding that the blue GCs
have a brighter mean luminosity and a narrower distribution than the red GCs.

quasars (BALQSOs) to the latest QSO catalogue constructed from Data Release 5
of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Our new hybrid classification scheme combines
the power of simple metrics, supervised neural networks and visual inspection.
In our view the resulting BALQSO catalogue is both more complete and more
robust than all previous BALQSO catalogues, containing 3552 sources selected
from a parent sample of 28,421 QSOs in the redshift range 1.7<z<4.2. This
equates to a raw BALQSO fraction of 12.5%.
  In the process of constructing a robust catalogue, we shed light on the main
problems encountered when dealing with BALQSO classification, many of which
arise due to the lack of a proper physical definition of what constitutes a
BAL. This introduces some subjectivity in what is meant by the term BALQSO, and
because of this, we also provide all of the meta-data used in constructing our
catalogue, for every object in the parent QSO sample. This makes it easy to
quickly isolate and explore sub-samples constructed with different metrics and
techniques. By constructing composite QSO spectra from sub-samples classified
according to the meta-data, we show that no single existing metric produces
clean and robust BALQSO classifications. Rather, we demonstrate that a variety
of complementary metrics are required at the moment to accomplish this task.
Along the way, we confirm the finding that BALQSOs are redder than non-BALQSOs
and that the raw BALQSO fraction displays an apparent trend with
signal-to-noise, steadily increasing from 9% in low signal-to-noise data, up to
15%.

nanotubes (SWNTs) twist during stretching, which is similar to the motion of a
screw. Obviously this phenomenon, as a type of curvature-chirality effect, can
not be explained by usual isotropic elastic theory of SWNT. More interestingly,
with larger axial strains (before buckling), the axial strain induced torsion
(a-SIT) shows asymmetric behaviors for axial tensile and compressing strains,
which suggests anharmonic elasticity of SWNTs plays an important role in real
a-SIT responses. In order to study the a-SIT of chiral SWNTs with actual sizes,
and avoid possible deviations of computer simulation results due to the
finite-size effect, we propose a 2D analytical continuum model which can be
used to describe the the SWNTs of arbitrary chiralities, curvatures, and
lengths, with the concerning of anisotropic and anharmonic elasticity of SWNTs.
This elastic energy of present model comes from the continuum limit of lattice
energy based on Second Generation Reactive Empirical Bond Order potential
(REBO-II), a well-established empirical potential for solid carbons. Our model
has no adjustable parameters, except for those presented in REBO-II, and all
the coefficients in the model can be calculated analytically. Using our method,
we obtain a-SIT responses of chiral SWNTs with arbitrary radius, chiralities
and lengthes. Our results are in reasonable agreement with recent molecular
dynamic simulations. [Liang {\it et. al}, Phys. Rev. Lett, ${\bf 96}$, 165501

dependent anharmonic mechanic responses of SWNTs.

burning products especially in the rapidly-expanding outer layers (v>~15000
km/s). The zone between ~8500 and 15000 km/s is dominated by oxygen and
includes some amount of intermediate mass elements. At lower velocities,
intermediate mass elements dominate. This holds down to the lowest zones
investigated in this work. This fact, together with negligible-to-moderate
abundances of Fe-group elements, indicates large-scale incomplete Si burning or
explosive O burning, possibly in a detonation at low densities. Consistently

quasars to investigate the CIV Baldwin Effect (BEff). The UV/optical spectra
are drawn from the Hubble Space Telescope, International Ultraviolet Explorer
and Sloan Digital Sky Survey archives. The X-ray spectra are from the Chandra
and XMM-Newton archives. We apply correlation and partial-correlation analyses
to the equivalent widths, continuum monochromatic luminosities, and alpha_ox,
which characterizes the relative X-ray to UV brightness. The equivalent width
of the CIV 1549 emission line is correlated with both alpha_ox and luminosity.
We find that by regressing l_UV with EW(CIV) and alpha_ox, we can obtain
tighter correlations than by regressing l_UV with only EW(CIV). Both
correlation and regression analyses imply that l_UV is not the only factor
controlling the changes of EW(CIV); alpha_ox (or, equivalently, the soft X-ray
emission) plays a fundamental role in the formation and variation of CIV.
Variability contributes at least 60% of the scatter of the EW(CIV)-l_UV
relation and at least 75% of the scatter of the of the EW(CIV)-alpha_ox
relation.
  In our sample, narrow Fe Kalpha 6.4 keV emission lines are detected in 50
objects. Although narrow Fe Kalpha exhibits a BEff similar to that of CIV, its
equivalent width has almost no dependence on either alpha_ox or EW(CIV). This
suggests that the majority of narrow Fe Kalpha emission is unlikely to be
produced in the broad emission-line region. We do find suggestive correlations
between the emission-line luminosities of CIV and Fe Kalpha, which could be
potentially used to estimate the detectability of the Fe Kalpha line of quasars
from rest-frame UV spectroscopic observations.

doubling relations. We hope that our data mine, obtained by exploiting the

of the identified cores have subsonic internal motions. The virial ratio, the
ratio of the virial mass to the LTE mass, tends to decrease with increasing the
LTE mass and about 60 percent of the cores have virial ratios smaller than 2,
indicating that these cores are not transient structures but self-gravitating.
The detailed virial analysis suggests that the surface pressure often dominates
over the self-gravity and thus plays a crucial role in regulating core
formation and evolution. By comparing the rho Oph cores with those in the Orion
A molecular cloud observed with the same telescope, we found that the
statistical properties of the core physical quantities are similar between the
two clouds if the effect of the different spatial resolutions is corrected. The
line widths of the rho Oph cores appear to be nearly independent of the core
radii over the range of 0.01 - 0.1 pc and deviate upwards from the Heyer &

protostellar outflows in the cluster environment.

showing the formal equivalence linking econometric multinomial logit models to

Curie-Weiss model for ferromagnets is considered as a starting point in
developing a model capable of describing sudden shifts in aggregate human
behaviour.
  Existence of the thermodynamic limit for the model is shown by an asymptotic
sub-additivity method and factorization of correlation functions is proved
almost everywhere. The exact solution of the model is provided in the
thermodynamical limit by finding converging upper and lower bounds for the
system's pressure, and the solution is used to prove an analytic result
regarding the number of possible equilibrium states of a two-population system.
  The work stresses the importance of linking regimes predicted by the model to
real phenomena, and to this end it proposes two possible procedures to estimate
the model's parameters starting from micro-level data. These are applied to
three case studies based on census type data: though these studies are found to
be ultimately inconclusive on an empirical level, considerations are drawn that
encourage further refinements of the chosen modelling approach.

parameters are unknown. We show that the orthodox maximum-likelihood statistic
(known as F-statistic) can be rediscovered as a Bayes factor with an unphysical
prior in amplitude parameter space. We introduce an alternative detection
statistic (""B-statistic"") using the Bayes factor with a more natural amplitude
prior, namely an isotropic probability distribution for the orientation of GW
sources. Monte-Carlo simulations of targeted searches show that the resulting
Bayesian B-statistic is more powerful in the Neyman-Pearson sense (i.e. has a
higher expected detection probability at equal false-alarm probability) than
the frequentist F-statistic.

one-parameter continuous semigroup either an outer or an inner conjugate of a
group of automorphisms? In other words, the problem is finding a fractional
linear model of the semigroup which is defined by a group of automorphisms of
the open unit disk. Our results enable us to establish some new important

relativity and astrophysics, which is related to the well known ""frozen star""
paradox. This paradox has been discussed intensively and seems to have been
solved in the comoving-like coordinates. However, to a real astrophysical
observer within a finite time, this problem should be discussed in the point of
view of the distant rest-observer, which is the main purpose of this paper.
Following the seminal work of Oppenheimer and Snyder (1939), we present the
exact solution for one or two dust shells collapsing towards a pre-existing
black hole. We find that the metric of the inner region of the shell is
time-dependent and the clock inside the shell becomes slower as the shell
collapses towards the pre-existing black hole. This means the inner region of
the shell is influenced by the property of the shell, which is contrary to the
result in Newtonian theory. It does not contradict the Birkhoff's theorem,
since in our case we cannot arbitrarily select the clock inside the shell in
order to ensure the continuity of the metric. This result in principle may be
tested experimentally if a beam of light travels across the shell, which will
take a longer time than without the shell. It can be considered as the
generalized Shapiro effect, because this effect is due to the mass outside, but
not inside as the case of the standard Shapiro effect. We also found that in
real astrophysical settings matter can indeed cross a black hole's horizon
according to the clock of an external observer and will not accumulate around
the event horizon of a black hole, i.e., no ""frozen star"" is formed for an
external observer as matter falls towards a black hole. (abridged)

Distribution Amplitude, are associated with different regimes of factorization.
In the kinematical region, where the two mechanisms overlap, duality is

mSUGRA and more general MSSM parameters can be measured by the LHC experiments

approximately lies in the region preferred by current data. The impact of the

are not well understood. This paper reviews the environment of three 10^7 Msun
clusters near the inner Lindblad resonance of the barred spiral NGC 1365. The
morphology, mass, and flow of HI and CO gas in the spiral and barred regions
are examined for evidence of the location and mechanism of cluster formation.
The accretion rate is compared with the star formation rate to infer the
lifetime of the starburst. The gas appears to move from inside corotation in
the spiral region to looping filaments in the interbar region at a rate of ~6
Msun/yr before impacting the bar dustlane somewhere along its length. The gas
in this dustlane moves inward, growing in flux as a result of the accretion to
~40 Msun/yr near the ILR. This inner rate exceeds the current nuclear star
formation rate by a factor of 4, suggesting continued buildup of nuclear mass
for another ~0.5 Gyr. The bar may be only 1-2 Gyr old. Extrapolating the bar
flow back in time, we infer that the clusters formed in the bar dustlane
outside the central dust ring at a position where an interbar filament
currently impacts the lane. The ram pressure from this impact is comparable to
the pressure in the bar dustlane, and both are comparable to the pressure in
the massive clusters. Impact triggering is suggested. The isothermal assumption
in numerical simulations seems inappropriate for the rare fraction parts of
spiral and bar gas flows. The clusters have enough lower-mass counterparts to
suggest they are part of a normal power law mass distribution. Gas trapping in
the most massive clusters could explain their [NeII] emission, which is not
evident from the lower-mass clusters nearby.

on the formation of such sub-millisecond pulsars in this paper. A new approach
to form a sub-millisecond pulsar (quark star) via accretion induced collapse
(AIC) of a white dwarf is investigated here. Under this AIC process, we found
that: (1) almost all the newborn quark stars could have an initial spin period
of $\sim 0.1$ ms; (2) the nascent quark stars (even with a low mass) have
sufficiently high spin-down luminosity and satisfy the conditions for pair
production and sparking process to be as sub-millisecond radio pulsars; (3) in
most cases, the timescales of newborn quark stars in the phase of spin period
$< 1$ (or $<0.5$) ms can be long enough to be detected.
  As a comparison, an accretion spin-up process (for both neutron and quark
stars) is also investigated. It is found that, quark stars formed through AIC
process can have shorter periods ($\leq$ 0.5 ms); while the periods of neutron
stars formed in accretion spin-up process must be longer than 0.5ms. Thus if a
pulsar with a period less than 0.5 ms can be identified in the future, it
should be a quark star.

hydrogen-like ions $(M^+,m^-,m^-)$ for any value of the proton-to-electron mass
ratio $M/m$; the energy of the lowest spin-triplet state of helium and
helium-like ions; the stability of the doubly-excited hydrogen ion with
unnatural parity. The positronium molecule $(e^+,e^+,e^-,e^-)$, which has been
predicted years ago and discovered recently, can also be shown to be stable
against spontaneous dissociation, though the calculation is a little more
involved. Emphasis is put on symmetry breaking which can either spoil or
improve the stability of systems.

demonstrated that these experiments can be accurately modeled using Mie
scattering or coupled dipole models. This can help confirm the physical
phenomena underlying the inter-particle interactions, but does not necessarily
develop a conceptual understanding of the effects that can lead to future
predictions. Here we interpret results from a Mie scattering model to obtain a
physical description which predict the behavior and trends for chains of
trapped particles in Gaussian beam traps. In particular, it describes the
non-uniform particle spacing and how it changes with the number of particles.

of general relativity. Third, we searched for the signature of latitudinal

manifestations. The first is the reduction in amplitude of perturbations around
the resonant point (wave energy absorption). The second is the generation of
mean shear flows outside the dissipative layer surrounding the resonant point.
Ruderman et al. [Phys. Plasmas 4, 75 (1997)] studied both these effects at the
slow resonance in isotropic plasmas. Clack et al. [Astron. Astrophys. 494}, 317
(2009)] investigated nonlinearity at the Alfven resonance, however, they did
not include the generation of mean shear flow. In this present paper, we
investigate the mean shear flow, analytically, and study its properties. We
find that the flow generated is parallel to the magnetic surfaces and has a
characteristic velocity proportional to $\epsilon^{1/2}$, where $\epsilon$ is
the dimensionless amplitude of perturbations far away from the resonance. This
is, qualitatively, similar to the flow generated at the slow resonance. The
jumps in the derivatives of the parallel and perpendicular components of mean
shear flow across the dissipative layer are derived. We estimate the generated
mean shear flow to be of the order of $10{\rm kms}^{-1}$ in both the solar
upper chromosphere and solar corona, however, this value strongly depends on
the choice of boundary conditions. It is proposed that the generated mean shear
flow can produce a Kelvin--Helmholtz instability at the dissipative layer which
can create turbulent motions. This instability would be an additional effect,
as a Kelvin--Helmholtz instability may already exist due to the velocity field
of the resonant Alfven waves. This flow can also be superimposed onto existing
large scale motions in the solar upper atmosphere.

K, is used to study complexation between adenosinetriphosphate (ATP), ATP
subsystem, and magnesium cofactor [Mg(H2O)6]2+, Mg subsystem, in a water pool,
modeled with 78 water molecules, in singlet (S) and triplet (T) states. The
computations prove that the way of ATP cleavage is governed by the electron
spin of Mg. In the S state Mg prefers chelation of \gamma-\beta-phosphate
oxygens (O1-O2), whereas in the T state it chelates \beta-\alpha-phosphate
oxygens (O2-O3) or produces a single-bonded intermediate. Unlike the chelates,
which initiate ionic reaction paths, the single-bonded intermediate starts off
a free-radical path of ATP cleavage, yielding a highly reactive
adenosinemonophosphate ion-radical, .AMP-, earlier observed in the CIDNP
(Chemically Induced Dynamic Nuclear Polarization) experiment (A.A. Tulub,
2006). The free-radical path is highly sensitive to Mg nuclear spin, which
through a hyperfine interaction favors the production of unpaired electron
spins. The unique role of Mg in ATP cleavage comes through its ability to serve
as a unique redox center, initially accepting an electron from ATP and then
giving it back to products. Redox activity of Mg differs for T and S states and
affects the number of coordinated water molecules. The findings give a new
insight into the NTP (N = nucleoside) energetics and assembly of NTP-operating
molecules, including proteins.
