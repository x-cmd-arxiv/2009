we study the (back-reacted) geometry created by a BPS M2-brane when it wraps a
cycle in a Calabi-Yau manifold. If it is to preserve supersymmetry, the
membrane background must obey certain conditions. These conditions are
expressed as geometrical constraints on differential forms and as such, can be
interpreted as calibrations. Knowing the complete set of calibrations is the
same as satisfying all conditions needed for supersymmetry preservation. While
a purely geometric background is completely specified through standard
calibrations, in order to fully describe a flux background, we must also state
its generalized calibrations. These can be found by probing the background with
BPS branes. The logic is simple. Since a BPS probe is guaranteed to be stable,
we require that its volume be given by a calibrated form. This applies equally
to both charged and uncharged probes; the former are stabilized by flux whereas
the latter achieve stability by minimizing their volumes. Volume-forms of
charged probes correspond to generalized calibrations and those of uncharged
probes, to standard calibrations. Previously geometries were probed only by
uncharged branes. The calibrations that were found had then to be supplemented
by additional conditions in order to guarantee supersymmetry preservation in
backgrounds with flux. Once the scope is broadened to include charged branes,
the 'missing conditions' (generalized calibrations) can also be recovered using
the probe analysis. We use this method to classify the backgrounds of wrapped
M2-branes embedded in Calabi-Yau manifolds by specifying their calibrations.

gives rise to large-scale granules causing observable surface inhomogeneities.
This convection is also extremely vigorous, and suspected to be one of the
causes of mass-loss in RSGs. It must thus be understood in details. Evidence
has been accumulated that there are asymmetries in the photospheres of RSGs,
but detailedstudies of granulation are still lacking. Interferometric
observations offer an exciting possibility to tackle this question, but they
are still often interpreted using smooth symmetrical limb-darkened intensity
distributions, or very simple spotted ad hoc models. Aims. We explore the
impact of the granulation on visibility curves and closure phases using the
radiative transfer code OPTIM3D. We simultaneously assess how 3D simulations of
convection in RSG with CO5BOLD can be tested against these observations.
Methods. We use 3D radiative-hydrodynamics (RHD) simulations of convection to
compute intensity maps at various wavelengths and time, from which we derive
interferometric visibility amplitudes and phases. We study their behaviour with
time, position angle, and wavelength, and compare them to observations of the
RSG alpha Ori Results. We provide average limb-darkening coefficients for RSGs.
We detail the prospects for the detection and characterization of granulation
(contrast, size) on RSGs. We demonstrate that our RHD simulations provide an
excellent fit to existing interferometric observation of alpha Ori, contrary to
limb darkened disks. This confirms the existence of large convective cells on
the surface of Betelgeuse.

orientational states and is known to present a highly bonded low density phase
and a loosely bonded high density phase. We show that the model liquid-liquid
transition is continuous, in contradiction with mean-field results on the
Husimi cactus and from the cluster variational method. We define an order
parameter which allows interpretation of the transition as an order-disorder
transition of the bond-network. Our results indicate that the order-disorder
transition is in the Ising universality class. Previous proposal of an
Ehrenfest second order transition is discarded. A detailed investigation of
anomalous properties has also been undertaken. The line of density maxima in
the HDL phase is stabilized by fluctuations, absent in the mean-field solution.

study a horizontal rotating drum filled with pure glycerol and three large,

tumble and thus interact with each other. We find several different behaviors
of the spheres depending on the drum rotation rate. Simpler states include the
spheres remaining well separated, or states where two or all three of the

these chaotic states and find that in many respects they are quite

brightness of the transition region, which is often significantly less than

approaches including filling factors and time-dependent heating. Here we focus
on an effect that has been ignored so far: the absorption of EUV light with
wavelengths below 912 {\AA} by the resonance continua of neutral hydrogen and
helium. Such absorption is expected to occur in the low-lying transition region
of hot, active region loops, that is co-located with cool chromospheric
features and called ``moss'' as a result of the reticulated appearance
resulting from the absorption. We use co-temporal and co-spatial
spectroheliograms obtained with SOHO/SUMER and Hinode/EIS of Fe XII 1242 {\AA},
195 {\AA} and 186.88 {\AA}, and compare the density determination from the
186/195 {\AA} line ratio to that resulting from the 195/1242 {\AA} line ratio.
We find significant absorption of 195 {\AA} emission caused by the
chromospheric inclusions in the moss. We find that the amount of absorption is
generally of order a factor of 2. We compare to numerical models and show that
the observed effect is well reproduced by 3D radiative MHD models of the
transition region and corona. We use STEREO A/B data of the same active region
and find that increased angles between line-of-sight and local vertical cause
additional absorption. Our determination of the amount of chromospheric
absorption of TR emission can be used to better constrain coronal heating

quality information is above a certain fixed threshold. Strong users send same

considered. The proposed analog & digital opportunistic feedback schemes are
shown to achieve the same sum-rate throughput as that achieved by dedicated
feedback schemes, but with feedback channels growing only logarithmically with
number of users. Moreover, there is also a reduction in the feedback load. In
the analog feedback case, we show that the propose scheme reduces the feedback
noise which eventually results in better throughput, whereas in the digital

coarse-grained entropy is minimum at the bounce and then grows during inflation
as the modes become excited away from the bounce and interact (assuming the
presence of an inflaton, and in the part of the quantum state in which the
inflaton is initially large enough to drive inflation). The part of this pure
quantum state that dominates for observations is well approximated by quantum
processes occurring within a Lorentzian expanding macroscopic universe. Because
this part of the quantum state has no negative Euclidean action, one can avoid
the early-time Boltzmann brains and Boltzmann solar systems that appear to
dominate observations in the Hartle-Hawking no-boundary wavefunction.

the presence of the proton drivers, the fast track to hints for CP violation
requires communication between the T2K and NOvA collaborations in terms of a

turbulent accretion characterized by a Shakura-Sunyaev viscosity parameter of
$\alpha \sim 10^{-2}$, with root-mean-square density perturbations of
$\sim$10%. We measure the statistical evolution of particle orbital properties
in our simulations including mean radius, eccentricity, and velocity
dispersion. We confirm random walk growth in time of all three properties, the
first time that this has been done with direct orbital integration in a local

up to boxes of eight scale heights in horizontal size. However, even our
largest boxes show velocity dispersions sufficiently low that collisional
destruction of planetesimals should be unimportant in the inner disk throughout
its lifetime. Our direct integrations agree with earlier torque measurements
showing that type I migration dominates over diffusive migration by stochastic
torques for most objects in the planetary core and terrestrial planet mass
range. Diffusive migration remains important for objects in the mass range of
kilometer-sized planetesimals. Discrepancies in the derived magnitude of
turbulence between local and global simulations of magneto-rotationally
unstable disks remains an open issue, with important consequences for planet

standard UBVRI filters and a narrow Halpha passband. The subsequent
differential photometry includes the central region of the object and the whole

models that describe the fluid physics relevant to the task at hand, while
neglecting irrelevant details of the flow in order to remain computationally
tractable. A number of techniques are presently used to develop such
reduced-order models, such as proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and
approximate snapshot-based balanced truncation, also known as balanced POD.
Each method has its strengths and weaknesses: for instance, POD models can
behave unpredictably and perform poorly, but they can be computed directly from
experimental data; approximate balanced truncation often produces vastly
superior models to POD, but requires data from adjoint simulations, and thus
cannot be applied to experimental data.
  In this paper, we show that using the Eigensystem Realization Algorithm (ERA)
\citep{JuPa-85}, one can theoretically obtain exactly the same reduced order
models as by balanced POD. Moreover, the models can be obtained directly from
experimental data, without the use of adjoint information. The algorithm can
also substantially improve computational efficiency when forming reduced-order
models from simulation data. If adjoint information is available, then balanced
POD has some advantages over ERA: for instance, it produces modes that are
useful for multiple purposes, and the method has been generalized to unstable
systems. We also present a modified ERA procedure that produces modes without
adjoint information, but for this procedure, the resulting models are not
balanced, and do not perform as well in examples. We present a detailed
comparison of the methods, and illustrate them on an example of the flow past
an inclined flat plate at a low Reynolds number.

of the initial stochastic dynamics: For general games, there might be
non-convergence, but when convergence of the ODE holds, considered stochastic
algorithms converge towards Nash equilibria. For games admitting Lyapunov
functions, that we call Lyapunov games, the stochastic dynamics converge. We
prove that any ordinal potential game, and hence any potential game is a
Lyapunov game, with a multiaffine Lyapunov function. For Lyapunov games with a
multiaffine Lyapunov function, we prove that this Lyapunov function is a
super-martingale over the stochastic dynamics. This leads a way to provide
bounds on their time of convergence by martingale arguments. This applies in
particular for many classes of games that have been considered in literature,
including several load balancing game scenarios and congestion games.

$\sqrt{s}=10$ and 14 TeV within the framework of the minimal supergravity
model. We improve upon previous reach projections by incorporating updated
background calculations including a variety of $2\to n$ Standard Model (SM)
processes. We show that SUSY discovery is possible even before the detectors
are understood well enough to utilize either $E_T^{\rm miss}$ or electrons in
the signal. We evaluate the early SUSY reach of the LHC at $\sqrt{s}=10$ TeV by
examining multi-muon plus $\ge4$ jets and also dijet events with {\it no}
missing $E_T$ cuts and show that the greatest reach in terms of $m_{1/2}$
occurs in the dijet channel. The reach in multi-muons is slightly smaller in
$m_{1/2}$, but extends to higher values of $m_0$. We find that an observable
multi-muon signal will first appear in the opposite-sign dimuon channel, but as
the integrated luminosity increases the relatively background-free but
rate-limited same-sign dimuon, and ultimately the trimuon channel yield the
highest reach. We show characteristic distributions in these channels that
serve to distinguish the signal from the SM background, and also help to
corroborate its SUSY origin. We then evaluate the LHC reach in various
no-lepton and multi-lepton plus jets channels {\it including} missing $E_T$
cuts for $\sqrt{s}=10$ and 14 TeV, and plot the reach for integrated
luminosities ranging up to 3000 fb$^{-1}$ at the SLHC. For $\sqrt{s}=10$ TeV,
the LHC reach extends to $m_{gluino}=1.9, 2.3, 2.8$ and 2.9 TeV for
$m_{squark}\sim m_{gluino}$ and integrated luminosities of 10, 100, 1000 and
3000 fb$^{-1}$, respectively. For $\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV, the LHC reach for the same
integrated luminosities is to $m_{gluino}=2.4,\3.1, 3.7$ and 4.0 TeV.

the green-wave method. For low densities, the self-organizing method promotes
the formation and coordination of platoons that flow freely in four directions,

stars due to its sensitivity to determine stellar ages. Aims: Our goal was to
detect p-mode oscillations in the metal-poor sub-dwarf 85 Peg A and to search
for other variability on longer timescales. Methods: We have obtained
continuous high-precision photometry of the binary system 85 Pegasi with the
MOST space telescope in two seasons (2005 & 2007). Furthermore, we redetermined
vsini for 85 Peg A using high resolution spectra obtained through the ESO
archive, and used photometric spot modeling to interpret long periodic
variations. Results: Our frequency analysis yields no convincing evidence for
p-modes significantly above a noise level of 4 ppm. Using simulated p-mode
patterns we provide upper RMS amplitude limits for 85 Peg A. The light curve
shows evidence for variability with a period of about 11 d and this periodicity
is also seen in the follow up run in 2007; however, as different methods to
remove instrumental trends in the 2005 run yield vastly different results, the
exact shape and periodicity of the 2005 variability remain uncertain. Our
re-determined vsini value for 85 Peg A is comparable to previous studies and we
provide realistic uncertainties for this parameter. Using these values in
combination with simple photometric spot models we are able to reconstruct the
observed variations. Conclusions: The null-detection of p-modes in 85 Peg A is
consistent with theoretical values for pulsation amplitudes in this star. The
detected long-periodic variation must await confirmation by further
observations with similar or better precision and long-term stability. If the
11 d periodicity is real, rotational modulation of surface features on one of
the components is the most likely explanation.

based on the two-component model of the Broad Line Region (BLR). In fitting
their broad H-beta lines, six of them only need one Gaussian component, one of
them has a double-peak profile, one has an irregular profile, and only two of
them need two components, i.e., a Very Broad Gaussian Component (VBGC) and an
Inter-Mediate Gaussian Component (IMGC). The Gaussian components are assumed to
come from two distinct regions in the two-component model; they are Very Broad
Line Region (VBLR) and Inter-Mediate Line region (IMLR). The two sources with a
two-component profile are Mrk 509 and NGC 4051. The time lags of the two
components of both sources satisfy $t_{IMLR}/t_{VBLR}=V^2_{VBLR}/V^2_{IMLR}$,
where $t_{IMLR}$ and $t_{VBLR}$ are the lags of the two components while
$V_{IMLR}$ and $V_{VBLR}$ represent the mean gas velocities of the two regions,
supporting the two-component model of the BLR of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN).
The fact that most of these ten sources only have the VBGC confirms the
assumption that RM mainly measures the radius of the VBLR; consequently, the
radius obtained from the R-L relationship mainly represent the radius of VBLR.
Moreover, NGC 4051, with a lag of about 5 days in the one component model, is
an outlier on the R-L relationship as shown in Kaspi et al. (2005); however
this problem disappears in our two-component model with lags of about 2 and 6
days for the VBGC and IMGC, respectively.

crop growth (Justus von Liebig, 1840) and quantitatively supported by many
experiments. Some generalizations based on more complicated ""dose-response""
curves were proposed. Violations of this law in natural and experimental
ecosystems were also reported. We study models of adaptation in ensembles of
similar organisms under load of environmental factors and prove that violation
of Liebig's law follows from adaptation effects. If the fitness of an organism
in a fixed environment satisfies the Law of the Minimum then adaptation
equalizes the pressure of essential factors and therefore acts against the
Liebig's law. This is the the Law of the Minimum paradox: if for a randomly
chosen pair ""organism-environment"" the Law of the Minimum typically holds,
then, in a well-adapted system, we have to expect violations of this law.
  For the opposite interaction of factors (a synergistic system of factors
which amplify each other) adaptation leads from factor equivalence to
limitations by a smaller number of factors.
  For analysis of adaptation we develop a system of models based on Selye's
idea of the universal adaptation resource (adaptation energy). These models
predict that under the load of an environmental factor a population separates
into two groups (phases): a less correlated, well adapted group and a highly
correlated group with a larger variance of attributes, which experiences
problems with adaptation. Some empirical data are presented and evidences of
interdisciplinary applications to econometrics are discussed.

presented. The thesis that they do not lead to a conceptual understanding of
life and biological systems is defended. Maturana and Varela's concept of
autopoiesis is briefly sketched and its logical circularity avoided by
postulating the existence of underlying {\it living processes}, entailing
amplification from the microscopic to the macroscopic scale, with increasing
complexity in the passage from one scale to the other. Following such a line of
thought, the currently accepted model of condensed matter, which is based on
electrostatics and short-ranged forces, is criticized. It is suggested that the
correct interpretation of quantum dispersion forces (van der Waals, hydrogen
bonding, and so on) as quantum coherence effects hints at the necessity of
including long-ranged forces (or mechanisms for them) in condensed matter
theories of biological processes. Some quantum effects in biology are reviewed
and quantum mechanics is acknowledged as conceptually important to biology
since without it most (if not all) of the biological structures and signalling
processes would not even exist. Moreover, it is suggested that long-range
quantum coherent dynamics, including electron polarization, may be invoked to
explain signal amplification process in biological systems in general.

function $S_q[p]=\int dx p(x)(-\ln p(x))^q$, we find the corresponding Fisher's
information measure. After function redefinition we then maximize the Fisher
information measure with respect to the new function and obtain a differential
operator that reduces to a space coordinate second derivative in the $q\to 1$
limit. We then propose a simple differential equation for anomalous diffusion
and show that its solutions are a generalization of the functions in the
Barenblatt-Pattle solution. We find that the mean squared displacement, up to a
$q$-dependent constant, has a time dependence according to $<x^2>\sim
K^{1/q}t^{1/q}$, where the parameter $q$ takes values $q=\frac{2n-1}{2n+1}$
(superdiffusion) and $q=\frac{2n+1}{2n-1}$ (subdiffusion), $\forall n\geq 1$.

and axial symmetries in the context of the SU(3) Polyakov--Nambu--Jona-Lasinio
(PNJL) model. The results lead to the conclusion that the effects of the
Polyakov loop are fundamental for reproducing lattice findings. It is found
that the restoration of chiral symmetry in the PNJL model occurs in a small
range of temperature (smaller that in the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL)), and the
topological susceptibility reproduces well the lattice results around
$T/T_c^\chi\approx 1.0$.
