well-motivated scenarios for inflation in string theory have monomial
potentials over super-Planckian field ranges, with superimposed sinusoidal
modulations from instanton effects. Such periodic modulations of the potential
can drive resonant enhancements of the correlation functions of cosmological
perturbations, with characteristic modulations of the amplitude as a function
of wavenumber. We give an analytical result for the scalar power spectrum in
this class of models, and we determine the limits that present data places on
the amplitude and frequency of modulations. Then, incorporating an improved
understanding of the realization of axion monodromy inflation in string theory,
we perform a careful study of microphysical constraints in this scenario. We
find that detectable modulations of the scalar power spectrum are commonplace
in well-controlled examples, while resonant contributions to the bispectrum are
undetectable in some classes of examples and detectable in others. We conclude
that resonant contributions to the spectrum and bispectrum are a characteristic
signature of axion monodromy inflation that, in favorable cases, could be
detected in near-future experiments.

quintessential model with an inverse-power-law potential and a Hubble-induced
mass term for the quintessence field. The presence of kination is associated
with an oscillating evolution of the quintessence field and the barotropic
index. We find that, in sizeable regions of the parameter space, a tracker
scaling solution can be reached sufficiently early to alleviate the coincidence
problem. Other observational constraints originating from nucleosynthesis, the
inflationary scale, the present acceleration of the universe and the
dark-energy-density parameter can be also met. The impact of this modified
kination-dominated phase on the thermal abundance of cold dark matter
candidates is investigated too. We find that: (i) the enhancement of the relic
abundance of the WIMPs with respect to the standard paradigm, crucially depends
on the hierarchy between the freeze-out temperature and the temperature at
which the extrema in the evolution of the quintessence field are encountered,
and (ii) the relic abundance of e-WIMPs takes its present value close to the
temperature at which the earliest extremum of the evolution of the quintessence
field occurs and, as a consequence, both gravitinos and axinos arise as natural
cold dark matter candidates. In the case of unstable gravitinos, the gravitino
constraint can be satisfied for values of the initial temperature well above
those required in the standard cosmology.

spin-orbit coupling and strong electron correlation, and show that the former
has both quantitative and qualitative effects upon the correlation-driven Mott
transition. As a specific example we take Ir-based pyrochlores, where the
subsystem of Ir 5d electrons is known to undergo a Mott transition. At weak

phase at weak spin-orbit interaction, and in a topological band insulator phase
at strong spin-orbit interaction. Very generally, we show that with increasing
strength of the electron-electron interaction, the effective spin-orbit
coupling is enhanced, increasing the domain of the topological band insulator.
Furthermore, in our model, we argue that with increasing interactions, the
topological band insulator is transformed into a ""topological Mott insulator""
phase, which is characterized by gapless surface spin-only excitations. The
full phase diagram also includes a narrow region of gapless Mott insulator with
a spinon Fermi surface, and a magnetically ordered state at still larger

over compact manifolds and gauge theories with compact groups) and satisfying
some discrete symmetry, the change of sign of the bare coupling g_0^2 at zero
results in a mere discontinuity in the average energy rather than the
catastrophic instability occurring in theories with integration over
arbitrarily large fields. This indicates that the large order of perturbative
series and the non-perturbative contributions should have unexpected features.
Using the large-N limit of 2-dimensional nonlinear O(N) sigma model, we discuss
the complex singularities of the average energy for complex 't Hooft coupling
lambda= g_0^2N. A striking difference with the usual situation is the absence
of cut along the negative real axis. We show that the zeros of the partition
function can only be inside a clover shape region of the complex lambda plane.
We calculate the density of states and use the result to verify numerically the
statement about the zeros. We propose dispersive representations of the
derivatives of the average energy for an approximate expression of the
discontinuity. The discontinuity is purely non-perturbative and contributions
at small negative coupling in one dispersive representation are essential to
guarantee that the derivatives become exponentially small when lambda -> 0^+ We
discuss the implications for gauge theories.

important step towards the understanding of observational data. This topic of
component separation is of particular importance in the observation of the
relic Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation, as performed by the WMAP satellite
and the more recent Planck mission, launched May 14th, 2009 from Kourou and
currently taking data. When performing any sort of component separation, some
assumptions about the components must be used. One assumption that many
techniques typically use is knowledge of the frequency scaling of one or more
components. This assumption may be broken in the presence of calibration
errors. Here we compare, in the context of imperfect calibration, the recovery
of a clean map of emission of the Cosmic Microwave Background from
observational data with two methods: FastICA (which makes no assumption of the
frequency scaling of the components), and an `Internal Linear Combination'
(ILC), which explicitly extracts a component with a given frequency scaling. We
find that even in the presence of small calibration errors with a Planck-style
mission, the ILC method can lead to inaccurate CMB reconstruction in the high
signal-to-noise regime, because of partial cancellation of the CMB emission in
the recovered map. While there is no indication that the failure of the ILC
will translate to other foreground cleaning or component separation techniques,
we propose that all methods which assume knowledge of the frequency scaling of
one or more components be careful to estimate the effects of calibration
errors.

thus obtained were used to assess the performance of a variety of density
functional methods. Double-hybrid functionals like B2GP-PLYP and B2K-PLYP,
especially with a small Grimme-type empirical dispersion correction, are
capable of rendering conformational energies of CCSD(T) quality. These were
then used as a `secondary standard' for a larger sample of alkanes, including
isopentane and the branched hexanes as well as key isomers of heptane and
octane. Popular DFT functionals like B3LYP, B3PW91, BLYP, PBE, and PBE0 tend to
overestimate conformer energies without dispersion correction, while the M06
family severely underestimates GG interaction energies. Grimme-type dispersion
corrections for these overcorrect and lead to qualitatively wrong conformer
orderings. All of these functionals also exhibit deficiencies in the conformer
geometries, particularly the backbone torsion angles. The PW6B95 and, to a
lesser extent, BMK functionals are relatively free of these deficiencies.
  Performance of these methods is further investigated to derive conformer
ensemble corrections to the enthalpy function, $H_{298}-H_0$, and the Gibbs

the introduction of decoherence by themselves do not lead to a destruction of

connected with short or long wires compared to the phase coherence length,
square networks and hollow cylinders. Compared to the well-known case of the
isolated ring, we show that for connected rings, the winding of the Brownian
trajectories around the rings is modified, leading to a different harmonics
content of the quantum oscillations. We relate this harmonics content to the
distribution of winding numbers. We consider the limits where coherence length
$L_\varphi$ is small or large compared to the perimeter $L$ of each ring
constituting the network. In the latter case, the coherent diffusive
trajectories explore a region larger than $L$, whence a network dependent
harmonics content. Our analysis is based on the calculation of the spectral
determinant of the diffusion equation for which we have a simple expression on
any network. It is also based on the hypothesis that the time dependence of the
dephasing between diffusive trajectories can be described by an exponential
decay with a single characteristic time $\tau_\varphi$ (model A) .
  At low temperature, decoherence is limited by electron-electron interaction,
and can be modelled in a one-electron picture by the fluctuating electric field
created by other electrons (model B). It is described by a functional of the
trajectories and thus the dependence on geometry is crucial. Expressions for
the magnetoconductance oscillations are derived within this model and compared
to the results of model A. It is shown that they involve several
temperature-dependent length scales.

positions of substrings in $Q$ matching $P$. The classical Knuth-Morris-Pratt
algorithm [SIAM J. Comput., 1977] solves the string matching problem in linear
time which is optimal if we can only read one character at the time. However,
most strings are stored in a computer in a packed representation with several
characters in a single word, giving us the opportunity to read multiple
characters simultaneously. In this paper we study the worst-case complexity of
string matching on strings given in packed representation. Let $m \leq n$ be
the lengths $P$ and $Q$, respectively, and let $\sigma$ denote the size of the
alphabet. On a standard unit-cost word-RAM with logarithmic word size we
present an algorithm using time $$ O\left(\frac{n}{\log_\sigma n} + m +
\occ\right). $$ Here $\occ$ is the number of occurrences of $P$ in $Q$. For $m
= o(n)$ this improves the $O(n)$ bound of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm.
Furthermore, if $m = O(n/\log_\sigma n)$ our algorithm is optimal since any
algorithm must spend at least $\Omega(\frac{(n+m)\log
  \sigma}{\log n} + \occ) = \Omega(\frac{n}{\log_\sigma n} + \occ)$ time to
read the input and report all occurrences. The result is obtained by a novel
automaton construction based on the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm combined with
a new compact representation of subautomata allowing an optimal

outskirts. On the other hand, if conduction is shut off by the heat-flux driven
buoyancy instability, then the cluster will cool to the CC state again, where
it is stabilized by low-level AGN heating. Thus, the cluster cycles between CC
and NCC states. In contrast with massive clusters, we predict the CC/NCC
bimodality should vanish in groups, due to the lesser role of conductive
heating there. We find tentative support from the distribution of central
entropy in groups, though firm conclusions require a larger sample carefully

dark matter haloes: (1) their radial density profile, rho, is better fit by a
form that flattens to a constant at the halo center (the Einasto profile) than
the widely-used NFW form; (2) the radial profile of the pseudo-phase-space
density, rho/sigma3, on the other hand, continues to be well fit by a power
law, as seen in earlier lower-resolution simulations. In this paper we use the
Jeans equation to argue that (1) and (2) cannot both be true at all radii. We
examine the implied radial dependence of rho/sigma3 over 12 orders of magnitude
in radius by solving the Jeans equation for a broad range of input rho and
velocity anisotropy beta. Independent of beta, we find that rho/sigma3 is
approximately a power law only over the limited range of halo radius resolvable
by current simulations (down to ~0.1% of the virial radius), and rho/sigma3
deviates significantly from a power-law below this scale for both the Einasto
and NFW rho. The same conclusion also applies to a more general
density-velocity relation rho/sigma_D^epsilon. Conversely, when we enforce
rho/sigma^3 r^{-eta} as an input, none of the physically allowed rho (occurring
for the narrow range 1.8<eta<1.9444) follows the Einasto form. We expect the
next generation simulations with better spatial resolution to settle the
debate: either the Einasto profile will continue to hold and rho/sigma3 will
deviate from a power law, or rho/sigma3 will continue as a power law and rho
will deviate from its current parameterizations.

few 1000 cm-3, local small spatial-scale variations, and a fall-off in the
minor axis direction. We discuss the implications of these results with regards
to the conditions/locations that may favour the escape of individual cluster
winds. Our findings imply that the starburst environment is highly fragmented
into a range of clouds from small/dense clumps with low filling factors (<1pc,
n_e>10^4 cm-3) to larger filling factor, less dense gas. The near-constant
state of the ionization state of the ~10^4 K gas throughout the starburst can
be explained as a consequence of the small cloud sizes, which allow the gas
conditions to respond quickly to any changes. We have examined in more detail
both the broad (FWHM 150-350 km/s) line component found in Paper I that we
associated with emission from turbulent mixing layers on the gas clouds, and
the discrete outflow channel identified within the inner wind. The channel
appears as a coherent, expanding cylindrical structure of length >120 pc and
and width 35-50 pc and the walls maintain an approximately constant (but
subsonic) expansion velocity of ~60 km/s. We use the channel to examine further
the relationship between the narrow and broad component emitting gas within the
inner wind. Within the starburst energy injection zone, we find that turbulent
motions (as traced by the broad component) appear to play an increasing role
with height.

recent experimental analyses of the D0 D0-bar pi0 channel, an event near the

recently derived linear mapping between the Kondo-regime temperature-dependent
conductance and the universal function describing the conductance for the
symmetric Anderson model of a quantum wire with an embedded quantum dot. Two
conduction paths, one traversing the wire, the other a bypass through the
quantum dot, are identified. A gate potential applied to the quantum wire is
shown to control the flow through the bypass. When the potential favors
transport through the wire, the conductance in the Kondo regime rises from
nearly zero at low temperatures to nearly ballistic at high temperatures. When
it favors the dot, the pattern is reversed: the conductance decays from nearly
ballistic to nearly zero. When the fluxes through the two paths are comparable,
the conductance is nearly temperature-independent in the Kondo regime, and a
Fano antiresonance in the fixed-temperature plot of the conductance as a
function of the dot energy signals interference. Throughout the Kondo regime
and, at low temperatures, even in the mixed-valence regime, the numerical data
are in excellent agreement with the universal mapping.

Both the database and the SAN are complex systems that need their own separate
administrative teams. This paper puts forth the vision of an innovative
management framework to simplify administrative tasks that require an in-depth
understanding of both the database and the SAN. As a concrete instance, we
consider the task of diagnosing the slowdown in performance of a database query
that is executed multiple times (e.g., in a periodic report-generation
setting). This task is very challenging because the space of possible causes
includes problems specific to the database, problems specific to the SAN, and
problems that arise due to interactions between the two systems. In addition,
the monitoring data available from these systems can be noisy.
  We describe the design of DIADS which is an integrated diagnosis tool for
database and SAN administrators. DIADS generates and uses a powerful
abstraction called Annotated Plan Graphs (APGs) that ties together the
execution path of queries in the database and the SAN. Using an innovative
workflow that combines domain-specific knowledge with machine-learning
techniques, DIADS was applied successfully to diagnose query slowdowns caused
by complex combinations of events across a PostgreSQL database and a production
SAN.

Entanglement renormalization is a real-space coarse-graining transformation for

entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), for the ground states of local
Hamiltonians. In this paper we describe in detail the fermionic version of the
MERA formalism and algorithm. Starting from the bosonic MERA, which can be
regarded both as a quantum circuit or in relation to a coarse-graining

fermions. To confirm the validity of the approach, we present benchmark results
for free and interacting fermions on a square lattice with sizes between $6

ongoing galaxy mergers, with nearby companion galaxies or tidal tails. Galaxy
mergers may be responsible for the truncation of star formation, or we are
observing the aftermath of merger triggered starbursts. As expected, the
optical colors of K+A galaxies largely fall between blue galaxies with ongoing
star formation and red passive galaxies. However, only 1% of the galaxies with
colors between the red and blue populations are K+A galaxies, and we conclude
that the truncation of star formation in K+A galaxies must have been unusually
abrupt (<100 Myr). We examined the AGN content of K+A galaxies with both
optical emission-line ratios (BPT diagrams) and Chandra X-ray imaging. At least
half of all K+A galaxies display the optical emission-line ratios of AGNs, and
a third of M_R<-22 K+A galaxies host AGNs with X-ray luminosities of 10^{42}
erg/s. The faintest K+A galaxies do not show clear evidence for hosting AGNs,
having emission-line ratios consistent with photoionization by massive stars
and few X-ray detections. We speculate that two mechanisms may be responsible
for the truncation of star formation in K+A galaxies, with AGN feedback only
playing a role in M_R<-20.5 galaxies.

progenitor scenario to produce type Ia supernova explosions, which is not
restricted to the ignition of a CO white dwarf near the Chandrasekhar mass. In
this scenario, a shock-triggered thermonuclear explosion ensues from the
collision of two white dwarfs. Consistent modeling of the gas dynamics together
with nuclear reactions using both a smoothed particle and a grid-based
hydrodynamics code are performed to study the viability of this alternative
progenitor channel. We find that shock-triggered ignition and the synthesis of
Ni are in fact a natural outcome for moderately massive white dwarf pairs
colliding close to head-on. We use a multi-dimensional radiative transfer code
to calculate the emergent broadband light curves and spectral time-series of
these events. The synthetic spectra and lightcurves compare well with those of
normal type Ia supernovae over a similar B-band decline rate and are broadly
consistent with the Phillips relation, although a mild dependence on viewing
angle is observed due to the asymmetry of the ejected debris. While event rates
within galactic centers and globular clusters are found to be much too low to
explain the bulk of the type Ia supernovae population, they may be frequent
enough to make as much as a one percent contribution to the overall rate.
Although these rate estimates are still subject to substantial uncertainties,
they do suggest that dense stellar systems should provide upcoming supernova
surveys with hundreds of such collision-induced thermonuclear explosions per
year.

registration of histological images for 3D reconstruction. First, possible
intensity variations and nonstandardness in images are corrected by an
intensity standardization process which maps the image scale into a standard
scale where the similar intensities correspond to similar tissues meaning.
Second, 2D histological images are mapped into a feature space where continuous
variables are used as high confidence image features for accurate registration.
Third, we propose an automatic best reference slice selection algorithm that
improves reconstruction quality based on both image entropy and mean square
error of the registration process. We demonstrate that the choice of reference
slice has a significant impact on registration error, standardization, feature
space and entropy information. After 2D histological slices are registered
through an affine transformation with respect to an automatically chosen
reference, the 3D volume is reconstructed by co-registering 2D slices
elastically.

trapping the atoms in an optical lattice in a ring configuration and rotating
the potential at a rate equal to half a quantum of angular momentum . In this

This in turn leads to event-by-event fluctuations of the average transverse

realistic hydrodynamic evolution and statistical hadronization carried out with

the behavior of matter at densities larger than that of the atomic nucleus; in

potential $v_{\text{x}}(\bf r)$ of the density functional theory (DFT) is very
well represented, within the region of every atomic shell, by each of the
suitably shifted potentials obtained with the non-local Fock exchange operator
for the individual Hartree-Fock (HF) orbitals belonging to this shell.
Consequently, the continuous piecewise function built of shell-specific
exchange potentials, each defined as the weighted average of the shifted
orbital exchange potentials corresponding %the HF orbitals from to a given
shell, yields another highly-accurate representation of $v_{\text{x}}(\bf r)$.
These newly revealed properties are {\em not} related to the well-known
step-like shell structure in the response part of $v_{\text{x}}(\bf r)$, but
they result from specific relations satisfied by the HF orbital exchange
potentials. These relations explain the outstanding proximity of the occupied
Kohn-Sham and HF orbitals as well as the high quality of the Krieger-Li-Iafrate

to the DFT exchange potential $v_{\text{x}}(\bf r)$. The constant shifts added
to the HF orbital exchange potentials, to map them onto $v_{\text{x}}(\bf r)$,
are nearly equal to the differences between the energies of the corresponding
KS and HF orbitals. It is discussed why these differences are positive and grow

  Journal",,"10.1088/0004-637X/702/2/1309",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We show that the period clustering of anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) and soft
gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs), their X-ray luminosities, ages and statistics can
be explained with fallback disks with large initial specific angular momentum.
The disk evolution models are developed by comparison to self-similar
analytical models. The initial disk mass and angular momentum set the viscous
timescale. An efficient torque, with (1 - w^2) dependence on the fastness
parameter w leads to period clustering in the observed AXP-SGR period range
under a wide range of initial conditions. The timescale t_0 for the early
evolution of the fallback disk, and the final stages of fallback disk
evolution, when the disk becomes passive, are the crucial determinants of the
evolution. The disk becomes passive at temperatures around 100 K, which
provides a natural cutoff for the X-ray luminosity and defines the end of
evolution in the observable AXP and SGR phase. This low value for the minimum
temperature for active disk turbulence indicates that the fallback disks are
active up to a large radius greater than ~10^{12} cm. We find that transient
AXPs and SGRs are likely to be older than their persistent cousins. A fallback
disk with mass transfer rates corresponding to the low quiescent X-ray
luminosities of the transient sources in early evolutionary phases would have a
relatively lower initial mass, such that the mass-flow rate in the disk is not
sufficient for the inner disk to penetrate into the light cylinder of the young
neutron star, making mass accretion onto the neutron star impossible. The
transient AXP phase therefore must start later. The model results imply that
the transient AXP/SGRs, although older, are likely to be similar in number to
persistent sources (abridged).

quasi-periodic oscillations (kHz QPOs) detected from the neutron star low-mass

larger data set than previously analyzed (all archival data from February 1996
up to October 2007), we first investigate the reality of the 1330 Hz QPO
reported by van Straaten et al. (2000). This QPO would be of particular
interest since it has the highest frequency reported for any source. A thorough
analysis of the same observation fails to confirm the detection. On the other
hand, over our extended data set, the highest QPO frequency we measure for the
upper kHz QPO is at about 1224 Hz; a value which is fully consistent with the
maximum values observed in similar systems. Second, we demonstrate that the
frequency dependence of the quality factor and amplitude of the lower and upper
kHz QPOs follow the systematic trends seen in similar systems (Barret et al.,
2006). In particular, 4U0614+09 shows a drop of the quality factor of the lower
kHz QPO above 700 Hz. If this is due to an approach to the innermost stable
circular orbit, it implies a neutron star mass of about 1.9 solar masses.
Finally, when analyzing the data over fixed durations, we have found a gap in
the frequency distribution of the upper QPO, associated with a local minimum of
its amplitude. A similar gap is not present in the distribution of the lower
QPO frequencies, suggesting some cautions when interpreting frequency ratio
distributions, based on the occurrence of the lower QPO only.
