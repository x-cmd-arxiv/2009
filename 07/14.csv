Fisher matrix forecasts for a weak lensing survey like Euclid with those for
the forthcoming Planck experiment. Under the assumption that neutrino mass
splitting is described by a normal hierarchy we find that the combination
Planck and Euclid will possibly reach enough sensitivity to put a constraint on
the mass of a single species. Using a Bayesian evidence calculation we find
that such future experiments could provide strong evidence for either a normal
or an inverted neutrino hierachy. Finally we show that if a particular neutrino
hierachy is assumed then this could bias cosmological parameter constraints,
for example the dark energy equation of state parameter, by > 1\sigma, and the

recent `Constitution' data of 397 supernovas, thereby updating the results in
some previous works. Even when beginning with a very strong prior probability
that favors an accelerated expansion, we end up with a marginal likelihood for
the deceleration parameter $q_0$ peaked around zero in the spatially flat case.
This is in agreement with some other analysis of the Constitution data. It is
also found that the new data significantly constrains the cosmic expansion
rates, when compared to the previous analysis. Here again we adopt the
model-independent approach in which the scale factor is expanded into a Taylor
series in time about the present epoch; for practical purposes, it is truncated
to polynomials of various orders, in different trials. Though one cannot regard
the polynomials thus obtained as models, in this paper we evaluate the total
likelihoods (Bayesian evidences) for them to find the order of the polynomial
having the largest likelihood. Analysis using the Constitution data shows that
the largest likelihood occurs for the fourth order polynomial and is of value
$\approx 0.77 \times 10^{-102}$. It is argued that this value, which we call
the likelihood for the model-independent approach, may be used to calibrate the
performance of realistic models.

that a unique steady translating near-circular bubble symmetric about the

frame is found as part of the solution. We prove global existence for symmetric
sufficiently smooth initial conditions close to this shape and show that the
steady translating bubble solution is an attractor within this class of

translating circular bubble without restriction on symmetry of initial
conditions. These results hold for any nonzero surface tension despite the fact
that a local planar approximation near the front of the bubble would suggest
Saffman Taylor instability.
  We exploit a boundary integral approach that is particularly suitable for
analysis of nonzero viscosity ratio between fluid inside and outside the
bubble. An important element of the proof was the introduction of a weighted
Sobolev norm that accounts for stabilization due to advection of disturbances
from the front to the back of the bubble.

networks in which many links contend for the channel using random access before
data transmissions. Simply put, DOS involves a process of joint channel probing
and distributed scheduling for ad-hoc (peer-to-peer) communications. Since, in
practice, link conditions are estimated with noisy observations, the
transmission rate has to be backed off from the estimated rate to avoid
transmission outages. Then, a natural question to ask is whether it is
worthwhile for the link with successful contention to perform further channel
probing to mitigate estimation errors, at the cost of additional probing. Thus
motivated, this work investigates DOS with two-level channel probing by
optimizing the tradeoff between the throughput gain from more accurate rate
estimation and the resulting additional delay. Capitalizing on optimal stopping
theory with incomplete information, we show that the optimal scheduling policy
is threshold-based and is characterized by either one or two thresholds,
depending on network settings. Necessary and sufficient conditions for both
cases are rigorously established. In particular, our analysis reveals that
performing second-level channel probing is optimal when the first-level
estimated channel condition falls in between the two thresholds. Numerical
results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed DOS with
two-level channel probing. We also extend our study to the case with limited
feedback, where the feedback from the receiver to its transmitter takes the
form of (0,1,e).

radial profile obtained by latitudinal averaging of the image is in good
agreement with the previous global helioseismology result. It is found that the
amplitude of the sound-speed perturbation at the tachocline varies with
latitude, but it is not clear whether this is in part or fully an effect of
instrumental distortion. Our initial results demonstrate that time-distance

ultracold gas of fermionic atoms is discussed within a functional
renormalization group approach. Non-perturbative flow equations, based on an
exact renormalization group equation, describe the scale dependence of the
flowing or average action. They interpolate continuously from the microphysics
at atomic or molecular distance scales to the macroscopic physics at much
larger length scales, as given by the interparticle distance, the correlation
length, or the size of the experimental probe. We discuss the phase diagram as
a function of the scattering length and the temperature and compute the gap,
the correlation length and the scattering length for molecules. Close to the
critical temperature, we find the expected universal behavior. Our approach
allows for a description of the few-body physics (scattering and molecular
binding) and the many-body physics within the same formalism.

important structures between open & closed and pure open string disk
amplitudes: it relates couplings of brane and bulk string states to pure brane

  On the string world-sheet this becomes a non-trivial monodromy problem, which
reduces the disk amplitude of N_o open and N_c closed strings to a sum of many
color ordered partial subamplitudes of N_o+2N_c open strings. This sum can be
further reduced to a sum over (N_o+2N_c-3)! subamplitudes of N=N_o+2N_c open

quadrants independently. We estimate the completeness level of the sample in
the fourth quadrant at 5 Jy, and the one in the first quadrant at 2 Jy. We show
that the two samples (fourth or first quadrant) include, as well as giant and
super-giant HII regions, a significant number of sub-giant sources. The LF is
obtained, in each Galactic quadrant, with a generalized Schmidt's estimator
using an effective volume derived from the observed spatial distribution of the
considered HII regions. The re-analysis also takes advantage of recently
published ancillary absorption data allowing to solve the distance ambiguity
for several objects. A single power-law fit to the LFs retrieves a slope equal
to -2.23+/-0.07 (fourth quadrant) and to -1.85+/-0.11 (first quadrant). We also
find marginal evidence of a luminosity break at L_knee = 10^23.45 erg s^(-1)
Hz^(-1) for the LF in the fourth quadrant. We convert radio luminosities into
equivalent H_alpha and Lyman continuum luminosities to facilitate comparisons
with extra-galactic studies. We obtain an average total HII regions Lyman
continuum luminosity of 0.89 +/- 0.23 * 10^(53) sec^(-1), corresponding to 30%
of the total ionizing luminosity of the Galaxy.

resolution HST images have also been used. The extinction exhibits a very
complex and patchy structure in ULIRGs on kpc scales, from basically
transparent regions to others deeply embedded in dust (Av~0.0 to Av~8.0 mag).
Nuclear extinction covers a broad range in Av from 0.6 to 6 mag, 69% of the
nuclei having Av>2.0 mag. Extinction in the external regions is substantially
lower than in the nuclei with 64% of the ULIRGs in the sample having median Av
of less than 2 mag for the entire galaxy. While post-coalescence nuclei tend to
cluster around Av values of 2 to 3 mag, pre-coalescence nuclei appear more
homogeneously distributed over the entire 0.4 mag <Av< 7.7 mag range. For the
average extinction (Av~2.0 derived for the ULIRGs of the sample, the ratio of
the de-reddened to observed SFR values is 6. The extinction-corrected,
Halpha-based SFR ranges from 10 to 300 Msun/yr. For only 28% of the cases the
de-reddened SFR is <20 Msun/yr, whereas for the observed SFR this percentage
increases to 72%. The IR-based SFR is always higher than the optical-based one,
with differences ranging from about 2 to up to 30. The nuclear observed SFR has
an average contribution to the total one of 16% for the entire sample. Once
corrected for extinction, the average value becomes 31%. Because of mostly
extinction effects, the optical (I-band) half-light radius in the sample

weighted sums of delta functions, corresponding to the concentration of mass
into `point particles'. At the highest level, the effective energy is entirely
local and contains information about the structure of each particle but no

cooperation but enhances it efficiently if the offspring of individuals that

resulting age distributions of players, and show that the heterogeneity is

typically have observed half-light radii <~1.5 kpc (<~ 0.2""). Although only
~50% of the detected LAE components are resolved at GOODS depth, the brightest
(V<~26.3) are all resolved in both GOODS and GEMS. Since we find little
evidence for a correlation between the rest-UV sizes and magnitudes of LAEs,
the majority should be resolved in a deeper survey at the ~0.05"" angular
resolution of HST. Most of the multi-component LAEs identified in shallow
frames become connected in deeper images, suggesting that the majority of the
rest-UV ""clumps"" are individual star-forming regions within a single system.

emission (measured by Spitzer as part of the S3MC and SAGE-SMC surveys) probes
the total gas column independent of molecular line emission and traces
shielding from photodissociating radiation. We calibrate a method to estimate
the dust column using only the high-resolution Spitzer data and verify that
dust traces the ISM in the HI-dominated region around N83. This allows us to
resolve the relative structures of H2, dust, and CO within a giant molecular
cloud complex, one of the first times such a measurement has been made in a
low-metallicity galaxy. Our results support the hypothesis that CO is
photodissociated while H2 self-shields in the outer parts of low-metallicity
GMCs, so that dust/self shielding is the primary factor determining the
distribution of CO emission. Four pieces of evidence support this view. First,
the CO-to-H2 conversion factor averaged over the whole cloud is very high 4-11
\times 10^21 cm^-2/(K km/s), or 20-55 times the Galactic value. Second, the
CO-to-H2 conversion factor varies across the complex, with its lowest (most
nearly Galactic) values near the CO peaks. Third, bright CO emission is largely
confined to regions of relatively high line-of-sight extinction, A_V >~ 2 mag,
in agreement with PDR models and Galactic observations. Fourth, a simple model
in which CO emerges from a smaller sphere nested inside a larger cloud can
roughly relate the H2 masses measured from CO kinematics and dust.

Suprime-Cam and MOIRCS instruments at the Subaru telescope. The survey covers
0.25sqdeg and reaches completeness limits of 24.7mag in the i'-band and 20.8mag
in the J-band. We select 196 candidates with colors as expected for young, very
low-mass objects. Follow-up multi-object spectroscopy with MOIRCS is presented
for 53 objects. We confirm 19 objects as likely brown dwarfs in NGC1333, seven
of them previously known. For 11 of them, we confirm the presence of disks
based on Spitzer/IRAC photometry. The effective temperatures for the brown
dwarf sample range from 2500K to 3000K, which translates to masses of ~0.015 to
0.1Ms. For comparison, the completeness limit of our survey translates to mass
limits of 0.004Ms for Av<~5mag or 0.008Ms for Av<~ 10mag. Compared with other
star-forming regions, NGC1333 shows an overabundance of brown dwarfs relative
to low-mass stars, by a factor of 2-5. On the other hand, NGC1333 has a deficit
of planetary-mass objects: Based on the surveys in SOrionis, the ONC and Cha I,
the expected number of planetary-mass objects in NGC1333 is 8-10, but we find
none. It is plausible that our survey has detected the minimum mass limit for
star formation in this particular cluster, at around 0.012-0.02Ms. If
confirmed, our findings point to significant regional/environmental differences
in the number of brown dwarfs and the minimum mass of the IMF. (abridged)

Batalin-Vilkovisky algebras with the required homotopy properties.
  To define this resolution we extend the theory of Koszul duality to operads
and properads that are defind by quadratic and linear relations. The operad
encoding Batalin-Vilkovisky algebras is shown to be Koszul in this sense. This
allows us to prove a Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt Theorem for such an operad and to
give an explicit small quasi-free resolution for it.
  This particular resolution enables us to describe the deformation theory and
homotopy theory of BV-algebras and of homotopy BV-algebras. We show that any
topological conformal field theory carries a homotopy BV-algebra structure
which lifts the BV-algebra structure on homology. The same result is proved for
the singular chain complex of the double loop space of a topological space
endowed with an action of the circle. We also prove the cyclic Deligne
conjecture with this cofibrant resolution of the operad BV. We develop the
general obstruction theory for algebras over the Koszul resolution of a
properad and apply it to extend a conjecture of Lian-Zuckerman, showing that
certain vertex algebras have an explicit homotopy BV-algebra structure.

possibly broadest and longest data set illustrating the prototype of this
behaviour was compiled from our own and archival observations. It comprises
optical and infrared spectra, broad-band polarimetry, and interferometric
observations. From 3 V/R cycles between 1997 and 2008, a mean cycle length in H
alpha of 1400-1430 days was derived. After each minimum in V/R, the shell
absorption weakens and splits into two components, leading to 3 emission peaks.
This phase makes the strongest contribution to the variability in cycle length.
V/R curves of different lines are shifted in phase. Lines formed on average
closer to the central star are ahead of the others. The shell absorption lines
fall into 2 categories differing in line width, ionization/excitation
potential, and variability of the equivalent width. The interferometry has
resolved the continuum and the line emission in Br gamma and He I 2.06. The
phasing of the Br gamma emission shows that the photocenter of the
line-emitting region lies within the plane of the disk but is offset from the
continuum source. The plane of the disk is constant throughout the observed V/R
cycles. The self-consistent, one-armed, disk-oscillation model is developed in

BAL RLQs possessing archival Chandra coverage. We compare the properties of
(predominantly high-ionization) BAL RLQs to those of non-BAL RLQs as well as to
BAL radio-quiet quasars (RQQs) and non-BAL RQQs for context.
  All 12 snapshot and 8/9 archival BAL RLQs are detected, with observed X-ray
luminosities less than those of non-BAL RLQs having comparable optical/UV
luminosities by typical factors of 4.1-8.5. (BAL RLQs are also X-ray weak by
typical factors of 2.0-4.5 relative to non-BAL RLQs having both comparable
optical/UV and radio luminosities.) However, BAL RLQs are not as X-ray weak
relative to non-BAL RLQs as are BAL RQQs relative to non-BAL RQQs. While some
BAL RLQs have harder X-ray spectra than typical non-BAL RLQs, some have
hardness ratios consistent with those of non-BAL RLQs, and there does not
appear to be a correlation between X-ray weakness and spectral hardness, in
contrast to the situation for BAL RQQs. RLQs are expected to have X-ray
continuum contributions from both disk-corona and small-scale jet emission.
While the entire X-ray continuum in BAL RLQs cannot be obscured to the same
degree as in BAL RQQs, we calculate that the jet is likely partially covered in
many BAL RLQs. We comment briefly on implications for geometries and source
ages in BAL RLQs.

in 118 new grism-spectroscopic redshifts for galaxies in the GOODS-South Field.

However, by fitting two Gaussian components to the H-beta and [OIII] features,
we find that many of the PEARS ELGs have high [OIII]/H-beta ratios compared to
other galaxy samples of comparable luminosities. The star-formation rates

discretized using the finite element method into a series of finite-dimensional

resulting optimization problem is large-scale and non-convex, with low

the helicity-isospin symmetry of the quark wave function of the nucleon. Our
estimate of the asymmetry within the quark-interchange model of hard scattering
demonstrates that the quark wave function of a nucleon based on the exact SU(6)
symmetry predicts an angular asymmetry opposite to that of experimental
observations. On the other hand the quark wave function based on the diquark
picture of the nucleon produces an asymmetry consistent with the data.
Comparison with the data allowed us to extract the relative sign and the
magnitude of the vector and scalar diquark components of the quark wave
function of the nucleon. These two quantities are essential in constraining QCD
models of a nucleon. Overall, our conclusion is that the angular asymmetry of a
hard elastic scattering of baryons provides a new venue in probing quark-gluon
structure of baryons and should be considered as an important observable in
constraining the theoretical models.

isotropic-inertia acoustic cloaks without singularity. The method is based on
the deformation view of the transformation method, where the transformation
tensor A is identified as the deformation gradient tensor and the transformed
material parameters can be expressed by the principal stretches in the
principal system of the deformation. The infinite material parameters of a
perfect 2D cloak is induced by an infinite principal stretch in one direction
while the other two remains finite at the inner boundary during the
transformation. To circumvent this difficulty, for a 2D cloak we can choose the
principal stretch perpendicular to the cloak plane to be also infinite but in
the same order as the infinite principal stretch in the cloak plane during the
transformation, so the transformed material parameters may keep finite. To
illustrate this idea, the analytical expressions of nonsingular material
parameters for a cylindrical acoustic cloak are given. For the acoustic cloaks
with irregular shapes, the numerical method is proposed to evaluate the
principal stretches and in turn the nonsingular material parameters. The
designed 2D cloaks are validated by numerical simulation.

hours, on 17 nights spanning 11 years (1998-2008). Using the CCD as an N-star
photometer, a detection limit of around 1% was attained for the intra-night

thus established a peculiar long-term INOV quiescence of this radio-selected BL

CT theorem, like Viennot's lattice path theorem from which it is derived

polynomials which in our applications of interest often turn out to be
non-classical. Hence we also present an efficient method for finding explicit
closed form polynomial expressions for these non-classical orthogonal

relies on simple combinatorial manipulations of Viennot's diagrammatic
representation for orthogonal polynomials. In the course of the paper we also
provide a new proof of Viennot's original orthogonal polynomial lattice path
theorem. The new proof is of interest because it uses diagonalization of the
transfer matrix, but gets around difficulties that have arisen in past attempts
to use this approach. In particular we show how to sum over a set of implicitly
defined zeros of a given orthogonal polynomial, either by using properties of
residues or by using partial fractions. We conclude by applying the method to
two lattice path problems important in the study of polymer physics as models

a relative variation of $\delta m_q/m_q = 0.016 \pm 0.005$ provides better
agreement between observed primordial abundances and those predicted by theory.
This is largely due to resolution of the existing discrepancies for 7Li.
However this method ignores possible changes in the position of resonances in
nuclear reactions. The predicted 7Li abundance has a strong dependence on the
cross-section of the resonant reactions 3He(d,p)4He and t(d,n)4He. We show that
changes in $m_q$ at the time of BBN could shift the position of these

the problem very general by working with the Hamiltonian without the

non-Markovian reservoir to the oscillators. We invoke an $N$-mode unitary
transformation of the position and momentum operators and find that in the
transformed basis the system is represented by a set of independent harmonic

Wigner representation of the density operator, we find that the covariance
matrix has a block diagonal form that it can be expressed in terms of multiples
of $3\times 3$ and $4\times 4$ matrices. This simple property allows to treat
the problem to some extend analytically. We illustrate the advantage of working
in the transformed basis on a simple example of three harmonic oscillators and
find that the entanglement can persists for long times due to presence of
constants of motion for the covariance matrix elements. We find that, in
contrast to what one could expect, a strong damping of the oscillators leads to
a better stationary entanglement than in the case of a weak damping.

external force. The gauge covariant derivative includes an external force as an
intrinsic part of the derivative and hence simplifies Lagrangians containing
tensor and gauge covariant fields. The gauge covariant derivative used in the
covariant Euler-Lagrange equation is presented as an extension of the
coordinate covariant derivative used in tensor analysis. Several examples
provide useful demonstrations of the covariant derivative relevant to studies
in general relativity and gauge theory.

oscilator plus Coulomb cluster-daughter interaction it is possible to derive a
linear relation between the logarithm of the reduced width squared and the
fragmentation potential, defined as the difference between the Coulomb barrier

between ground states, as well as for most $\alpha$-decays to low lying $2^+$

submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) lensed by foreground galaxy clusters, both at
radio and submm wavelengths. The galaxy cluster population is modeled in a
realistic way with the use of semi-analytic merger trees, while the density
profiles of individual deflectors take into account ellipticity and
substructures. The adopted typical size of the radio and submm emitting regions
of SMGs is based on current radio/CO observations and the FIR-radio
correlation. The source redshift distribution has been modeled using three
different functions (based on spectroscopic/photometric redshift measurements
and a simple evolutionary model) to quantify the effect of a high redshift tail
on the number of arcs. The source number counts are compatible with currently
available observations, and were suitably distorted to take into account the
lensing magnification bias. We present tables and plots for the numbers of
radio and submm arcs produced by SMGs as a function of surface brightness,
useful for the planning of future surveys aimed at arc statistics studies. They
show that e.g., the detection of several hundred submm arcs on the whole sky

developed cosmic shear measure, improves on this issue and is able to decompose
E- and B-modes using a 2PCF measured on a finite interval. First, we improve on
the ring statistics' filter function with respect to the signal-to-noise ratio.
Second, we examine the ability of the ring statistics to constrain cosmology
and compare the results to cosmological constraints obtained with the aperture
mass dispersion. Third, we use the ring statistics to measure a cosmic shear
signal from CFHTLS (Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey) data. We
consider a scale-dependent filter function for the ring statistics which
improves its signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, we show that there exist
filter functions which decompose E- and B-modes using a finite range of 2PCFs
(EB-statistics) and have higher S/N ratio than the ring statistics. However, we
find that data points of the latter are significantly less correlated than data
points of the aperture mass dispersion and the EB-statistics. As a consequence
the ring statistics is an ideal tool to identify remaining systematics
accurately as a function of angular scale. We use the 2PCF of the latest CFHTLS

driven the development of human civilisation since the onset of the

deformation expressible in terms of its Burgers vector[1,2]. Theorising the
mechanisms of dislocation motion at the atomistic scales of length and time
remains a challenging task on account of the extreme complexities associated
with the dynamics. We present a new concept of modelling a moving dislocation
as the dynamic distribution of the elastic field singularity within the span of
the Burgers vector. Surprisingly, numerical implementation of this model for
the periodic expansion-shrinkage cycle of the singularity is found to exhibit
an energetics, which resembles that of a dislocation moving in the presence of
the Peierls barrier[1-4]. The singularity distribution is shown to be the
natural consequence under the external shear stress. Moreover, in contrast to

  18-22, 2009, Ljubljana, Slovenia",,,,"cs.CC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  In the theory of algorithmic randomness, several notions of random sequence
are defined via a game-theoretic approach, and the notions that received most
attention are perhaps Martin-Loef randomness and computable randomness. The
latter notion was introduced by Schnorr and is rather natural: an infinite
binary sequence is computably random if no total computable strategy succeeds
on it by betting on bits in order. However, computably random sequences can
have properties that one may consider to be incompatible with being random, in
particular, there are computably random sequences that are highly compressible.
The concept of Martin-Loef randomness is much better behaved in this and other
respects, on the other hand its definition in terms of martingales is
considerably less natural. Muchnik, elaborating on ideas of Kolmogorov and
Loveland, refined Schnorr's model by also allowing non-monotonic strategies,
i.e. strategies that do not bet on bits in order. The subsequent
``non-monotonic'' notion of randomness, now called Kolmogorov-Loveland
randomness, has been shown to be quite close to Martin-Loef randomness, but
whether these two classes coincide remains a fundamental open question. As
suggested by Miller and Nies, we study in this paper weak versions of
Kolmogorov-Loveland randomness, where the betting strategies are non-adaptive
(i.e., the positions of the bits to bet on should be decided before the game).
We obtain a full classification of the different notions we consider.

become in recent years a field of intense research in computer science and
discrete mathematics. Nowadays, a random planar graph is an important and
challenging model for evaluating methods that are developed to study properties
of random graphs from classes with structural side constraints. In this paper
we focus on the structure of random biconnected planar graphs regarding the
sizes of their 3-connected building blocks, which we call cores. In fact, we
prove a general theorem regarding random biconnected graphs. If B_n is a graph
drawn uniformly at random from a class B of labeled biconnected graphs, then we
show that with probability 1-o(1) B_n belongs to exactly one of the following
categories:
  (i) Either there is a unique giant core in B_n, that is, there is a 0 < c < 1
such that the largest core contains ~ cn vertices, and every other core
contains at most n^a vertices, where 0 < a < 1; (ii) or all cores of B_n
contain O(log n) vertices.
  Moreover, we find the critical condition that determines the category to
which B_n belongs, and also provide sharp concentration results for the counts
of cores of all sizes between 1 and n. As a corollary, we obtain that a random
biconnected planar graph belongs to category (i), where in particular c =
0.765... and a = 2/3.

concentrated microgel system, for which the packing fraction can be
conveniently varied by changing the temperature. The packing fraction dependent
mechanical properties are characterised by a fluid-solid transition, where the
system properties switch from a viscous to an elastic low-frequency behaviour.
Approaching this transition from below, we find that the range of spatial
correlations in the dynamics increases. Beyond this transition, the spatial
correlation range reaches a maximum, extending over the entire observable
system size of approximately 5 mm. Increasing the packing fraction even further
leads to a second transition, which is characterised by the development of
large zones of lower and higher dynamical activity that are well separated from
each other; the range of correlation decreases at this point. This striking
non-monotonic dependence of the spatial correlation length on volume fraction
is reminiscent of the behaviour recently observed at the jamming/rigidity
transition in granular systems (Lechenault et al. 2008). We identify this
second transition as the transition to 'squeezed' states, where the
constituents of the system start to exert direct contact forces on each other,
such that the dynamics becomes increasingly determined by imbalanced stresses.
Evidence of this transition is also found in the frequency dependence of the
storage and loss moduli, which become increasingly coupled as direct friction
between the particles starts to contribute to the dissipative losses within the
system. To our knowledge, our data provide the first observation of a
qualitative change in dynamical heterogeneity as the dynamics switch from
purely thermally-driven to stress-driven.

systems. Cells initially respond to external changes in the environment, but
after some time, they regain their original state. By considering an element
consisting of two variables that show such adaptation dynamics, we studied a
coupled dynamical system containing such elements to examine the diverse
dynamics in the system and classified the behaviors on the basis of the network
structure that determined the interaction among elements. For a system with two
elements, two types of behaviors, perfect adaptation and simple oscillation,
were observed. For a system with three elements, in addition to these two
types, novel types of dynamics, namely, rapid burst-type oscillation and a slow
cycle, were discovered; depending on the initial conditions, these novel types
of dynamics coexisted. These behaviors are a result of the characteristic
dynamics of each element, i.e., fast response and slow adaptation processes.
The behaviors depend on the network structure (in specific, a combination of
positive or negative feedback among elements). Cooperativity among elements due
to a positive feedback loop leads to simple oscillation, whereas frustration
involving alternating positive and negative interactions among elements leads
to the coexistence of rapid bursting oscillation and a slow cycle. These
behaviors are classified on the basis of the frustration indices defined by the
network structure. The period of the slow cycle is much longer than the
original adaptation time scale, while the burst-type oscillation is a continued
response that does not involve any adaptation. We briefly discuss the universal
applicability of our results to a network of a larger number of elements and
their possible relevance to biological systems.

known magnetic DAs from the SDSS (97 previously published plus 44 newly
discovered) and also investigated the statistical properties of magnetic field
geometries of this sample. The total number of known magnetic white dwarfs
already more than tripled by the SDSS and more objects are expected from a more
systematic search. The magnetic fields span a range between ~1 and 900 MG. Our
results further support the claim that Ap/Bp population is insufficient in
generating the numbers and field strength distributions of the observed MWDs,
and either another source of progenitor types or binary evolution is needed.
Moreover clear indications for non-centered dipoles exist in about ~50% of the
objects which is consistent with the magnetic field distribution observed in
Ap/Bp stars.

we assemble whole, self-consistent gap junction and chemical synapse networks

topological properties of the network, such as degree distributions, synaptic
multiplicities, and small-world properties, that help in understanding network
signal propagation. We identify neurons that may play central roles in
information processing and network motifs that could serve as functional
modules of the network. We explore propagation of neuronal activity in response
to sensory or artificial stimulation using linear systems theory and find
several activity patterns that could serve as substrates of previously
described behaviors. Finally, we analyze the interaction between the gap
junction and the chemical synapse networks. Since several statistical
properties of the C. elegans network, such as multiplicity and motif
distributions are similar to those found in mammalian neocortex, they likely
point to general principles of neuronal networks. The wiring diagram reported
here can help in understanding the mechanistic basis of behavior by generating
predictions about future experiments involving genetic perturbations, laser
ablations, or monitoring propagation of neuronal activity in response to

accretion rate estimates yields a similar slope of alpha~2.8 in the subsolar
regime, but a shallower slope of alpha~2.0 if the whole mass range of 0.04
M_sun-5 Msun is included. Among the transition disk objects, the fraction of
stars that show significant accretion activity is relatively low compared to
stars with still optically thick disks (26\pm11% vs. 57\pm6%, respectively).
However, those transition disks that do show significant accretion have the
same median accretion rate as normal optically thick disks of 3-4*10^{-9}
M_sun/yr. We find that the ages of the transition disks and the WTTSs without
disks are statistically indistinguishable, and both groups are significantly
older than the CTTSs. These results argue against disk-binary interaction or
gravitational instability as mechanisms causing a transition disk appearance.
Our observations indicate that disk lifetimes in the clustered population are

focuses on low luminosity, low redshift (z < 0.25) AGN selected among emission
line galaxies as well as X-ray, radio and mid-infrared selected type 2 AGN
samples from the literature. The available multi-band photometry covers the
spectral range from the u-band up to 160 um. The observed SED of each object is
fit to a set of multi-component models comprising a stellar component, a high
optical depth torus and cold emission from a starburst (SB). The contribution
of the various components (stars, torus, SB) is reflected in the position of
the objects on the IRAC colour diagram. The comparison of type 1 (as derived
from Hatziminaoglou et al. 2008) and type 2 AGN properties is broadly
consistent with the Unified Scheme. The estimated ratio between type 2 and type
1 objects is about 2-2.5:1. The AGN accretion-to-infrared luminosity ratio is
an indicator of the obscuration of the AGN since it scales down with the
covering factor. We find evidence supporting the receding torus paradigm, with
the estimated fraction of obscured AGN decreasing with increasing optical
luminosity over four orders of magnitude. The average star formation rates are
of ~ 10, 40 and 115 Mo/yr for the low-z, type 2 and quasar samples,
respectively; but this might simply reflect observational biases, as our
quasars are one to two orders of magnitude more luminous than the type 2 AGN.
For the majority of objects with 70 and/or 160 um detections an SB component
was needed in order to reproduce the data points, implying that the
far-infrared emission in AGN arises mostly from star formation; moreover, the
SB-to-AGN luminosity ratio shows a slight trend with increasing luminosity.

the Jensen channel is equivalent to the original channel in the sense of the DM

systematic procedure for designing DM tradeoff optimal codes for general

separated into two simpler and independent problems: the design of an inner
code, or precoder, adapted to the channel statistics (i.e., the selectivity
