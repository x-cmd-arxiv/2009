nuclei, we study implications of this assumption on EWSB, Higgs boson mass and
direct production of scalar DM at LHC experiments. We show that this
interpretation indicates relatively light DM, M_DM ~ O(100) GeV, with large

predicted to be long-lived, providing distinctive experimental signatures of
displaced vertex of two leptons or jets plus missing transverse energy.

Coupling this to the ~51-day precession cycle of the CGRO orbit, we can
complete a full survey of the sky, localizing point sources to < 1 deg

emitters at z=0.84 obtained as part of the Hi-z Emission Line Survey (HiZELS)
are investigated. The spatial correlation function is very well-described by
(r/r_0)^-1.8, with r_0=2.7+-0.3Mpc/h. The correlation length r_0 increases
strongly with H-alpha luminosity, L_H-alpha, from r_0~2Mpc/h for the most
quiescent galaxies (star-formation rates of ~4M_sun/yr), up to r_0>5Mpc/h for
the brightest galaxies in H-alpha. The correlation length also increases with
increasing rest-frame K-band luminosity (M_K), but the r_0-L_H-alpha
correlation maintains its full statistical significance at fixed M_K. At
z=0.84, star-forming galaxies classified as irregulars or mergers are much more
clustered than discs and non-mergers, but once the samples are matched in
L_H-alpha and M_K, the differences vanish, implying that the clustering is
independent of morphological type at z~1. The typical H-alpha emitters found at
z=0.84 reside in dark-matter haloes of ~10^12M_sun, but those with the highest
SFRs reside in more massive haloes of ~10^13M_sun. Comparing the results with
those of H-alpha surveys at different redshifts, it is seen that although the
break of the H-alpha luminosity function, L*, evolves by a factor of ~30 from
z=0.24 to z=2.23, galaxies with the same L_H-alpha/L*(z) are found in dark
matter haloes of similar masses, independently of cosmic time. This not only
confirms that star-formation is more efficient at higher redshift, but also
suggests a fundamental connection between the strong decrease of L* since
z=2.23 and the quenching of star-formation in galaxies residing within
dark-matter haloes significantly more massive than 10^12M_sun at any given

constrained mechanism to regulate star formation (SF) in low and intermediate

photoionization by local sources on the gas cooling. We show that the soft
X-ray and EUV flux generated by SF is able to efficiently remove the main
coolants (e.g., HeII, OV and FeIX) from the halo gas via direct
photoionization. As a consequence, the cooling and accretion time of the gas
surrounding star-forming galaxies may increase by one or two orders of
magnitude. For a given halo mass and redshift, the effect is directly related
to the value of the star formation rate (SFR). Our results suggest the
existence of a critical SFR above which ""cold"" mode accretion is stopped, even
for haloes with virial masses well below the critical shock-heating mass
suggested by previous studies.The evolution of the critical SFR with redshift,
for a given halo mass, resembles the respective steep evolution of the observed
SFR for z<1. This suggests that photoionization by local sources would be able
to regulate gas accretion and star formation, without the need for additional,
strong feedback processes.

considerable impact on public health and economic wealth. The large variability
in spatio-temporal patterns of epidemics prohibits simple interventions and
demands for a detailed analysis of each epidemic with respect to its infectious
agent and the corresponding routes of transmission. To facilitate this
analysis, a mathematical framework is introduced which links epidemic patterns
to the topology and dynamics of the underlying transmission network. The
evolution both in disease prevalence and transmission network topology are
derived from a closed set of partial differential equations for infections
without recovery which are in excellent agreement with complementarily
conducted agent based simulations. The mutual influence between the epidemic
process and its transmission network is shown by several case studies on HIV
epidemics in synthetic populations. They reveal context dependent key processes
which drive the epidemic and which in turn can be exploited for targeted
intervention strategies. The mathematical framework provides a capable toolbox
to analyze epidemics from first principles. This allows for fast in silico
modeling - and manipulation - of epidemics which is especially powerful if
complemented with adequate empirical data for parametrization.

superconducting behaviour of the related layered iron pnictides. The structural
and ensuing semimetallic band structural forms are here rather unusual, with
the resulting ground state details extremely sensitive to the precise shape of
the Fe-X coordination unit. The superconductivity is presented as coming from a
combination of Resonant Valence Bond (RVB) and Excitonic Insulator physics, and
incorporating Boson-Fermion degeneracy. Although sourced in a very different
fashion the latter leads to some similarites with the high temperature
superconducting (HTSC) cuprates. The Excitonic Insulator behaviour sees SDW,
CDW/PLD and superconductive instabilities all vie for ground state status. The
conflict leads to a very sensitive and complex set of properties, frequently
mirroring HTSC cuprate behaviour. The delicate balance between ground states is
made particularly difficult to unravel by the micro-inhomogeneity of structural
form which it can engender. It is pointed out that several other notable
superconductors, layered in form, semimetallic with indirect overlap and
possessing homopolar bonding, would look to fall into the same general
category, beta-ZrNCl and MgB2 and the high-pressure forms of several elements,

enabling the occurrence of ordered states. Crystals arise from the breaking of
translation symmetry, magnets from broken spin rotation symmetry and massive
particles break a phase rotation symmetry. Time translation symmetry can be
spontaneously broken in exactly the same way. The order associated with this
form of spontaneous symmetry breaking is characterised by the emergence of
quantum state reduction: systems which spontaneously break time translation
symmetry act as ideal measurement machines. In this review the breaking of time
translation symmetry is first compared to that of other symmetries such as
spatial translations and rotations. It is then discussed how broken time
translation symmetry gives rise to the process of quantum state reduction and
how it generates a pointer basis, Born's rule, etc. After a comparison between
this model and alternative approaches to the problem of quantum state
reduction, the experimental implications and possible tests of broken time
translation symmetry in realistic experimental settings are discussed.

Compared to the pure SWCNT film, the photoresponse [(light current - dark

photoresponse is up to 157% when SWCNTs are embedded in P3HT-b-PS while for a

considering Floquet theory and using a singular perturbation method. We
demonstrate the work of the newly developed theory on simple examples. We also
develop a numerical implementation of the quotient system method, demonstrate
its numerical convergence and its use in calculations which would be difficult
to do by the standard methods, and also link this study to the problem of

propagating in a compressible fluid, do not touch the ground: they levitate in

object hidden underneath, or touching either sides of a square cylinder on, or
over, the ground. The tentlike carpets attached to the sides of a square
cylinder illustrate how the notion of a carpet on a wall naturally generalizes
to sides of other small compact objects. We then extend the concept of flying
carpets to circular cylinders. However, instead of reducing its scattering
cross-section like in acoustic cloaks, we rather mimic that of another
obstacle, say a square rigid cylinder. For instance, show that one can hide any
type of defects under such circular carpets, and yet they still scatter waves
just like a smaller cylinder on its own. Interestingly, all these carpets are
described by non-singular acoustic parameters. To exemplify this important
aspect, we propose a multi-layered carpet consisting of isotropic homogeneous
fluids with constant bulk modulus and varying density which works over a finite
range of wavelengths. We have discussed some applications, with the sonar boats

this EFT consists of the multipole expansion, which we describe in terms of a
diffeomorphism invariant point particle Lagrangian. The EFT also systematically
captures ""post-Minkowskian"" corrections to the multipole expansion due to
non-linear terms in general relativity. Specifically, we compute long distance
corrections from the coupling of the (mass) monopole moment to the quadrupole
moment, including up to two mass insertions. Along the way, we encounter both
logarithmic short distance (UV) and long wavelength (IR) divergences. We show
that the UV divergences can be (1) absorbed into a renormalization of the
multipole moments and (2) resummed via the renormalization group. The IR
singularities are shown to cancel from properly defined physical observables.
As a concrete example of the formalism, we use this EFT to reproduce a number
of post-Newtonian corrections to the gravitational wave energy flux from
non-relativistic binaries, including long distance effects up to 3PN ($v^6$)

consistent with results in earlier stars. A few very slowly rotating stars show
very weak magnetic fields and Halpha emission, all stars rotating faster than
our detection limit show magnetic fields of at least a few hundred Gauss. In
contrast to earlier-type stars, we observe magnetic fields weaker than 1kG in
stars rotating faster than ~3km/s, but we find no correlation between rotation

change in the dynamo mechanism; in ultracool dwarfs, magnetic field generation
is predominantly achieved by a turbulent dynamo, while other mechanisms can
operate more efficiently at earlier spectral type.

due to inefficient gas accretion. Alternatively, these black holes may form by
direct collapse of gas at the center of protogalaxies. However, this requires
metal-free gas that does not cool efficiently and thus is not turned into
stars, in contrast with the rapid metal enrichment of protogalaxies. Here we
use a numerical simulation to show that mergers between massive protogalaxies
naturally produce the required central gas accumulation with no need to
suppress star formation. Merger-driven gas inflows produce an unstable, massive
nuclear gas disk. Within the disk a second gas inflow accumulates more than 100
million solar masses of gas in a sub-parsec scale cloud in one hundred thousand

the formation of a massive black hole. The black hole can grow to a billion

to powerful QSOs. This, coupled with their high IR-to-optical ratios and often
significant silicate absorption, strongly argues in favor of these mid-IR

two ULIRGs, while the rest have only upper limits. Using the IRS-derived 5.8um
AGN continuum luminosity as a proxy for the expected X-ray luminosities, we
find that all of the observed sources must individually be highly obscured,

cm-2). With a space density of ~1.4e-7 Mpc-3 at z~2, such objects imply a lower
limit on the obscured AGN fraction (i.e., the ratio of AGN above and below

based on extensive multi-wavelength constraints including Spitzer IRS spectra,

plasma diagnostics and the availability of high-performance computers, have
recently stimulated the growth of high-energy density laboratory astrophysics.
In particular a number of experiments have been designed to study radiative
shocks and jets with the aim of shedding new light on physical processes linked
to the ejection and accretion of mass by newly born stars.
  Although general scaling laws are a powerful tools to link laboratory
experiments with astrophysical plasmas, the phenomena modelled are often too
complicated for simple scaling to remain relevant. Nevertheless, the
experiments can still give important insights into the physics of astrophysical
systems and can be used to provide the basic experimental validation of
numerical simulations in regimes of interest to astrophysics.
  We will illustrate the possible links between laboratory experiments,
numerical simulations and astrophysics in the context of stellar jets. First we
will discuss the propagation of stellar jets in a cross-moving interstellar
medium and the scaling to Z-pinch produced jets. Our second example focuses on
slab-jets produced at the PALS (Prague Asterix Laser System) laser installation
and their practical applications to astrophysics. Finally, we illustrate the
limitations of scaling for radiative shocks, which are found at the head of the
most rapid stellar jets.

thermodynamic properties of monatomic liquids, the point has been reached where
an improved model is needed for the small (approx. 10%) transit contribution.
Toward this goal, an analysis of the available high-temperature experimental
entropy data for elemental liquids was recently completed [D. C. Wallace, E. D.
Chisolm, and N. Bock, Phys. Rev. B 79, 051201 (2009)]. This analysis yields a
common curve of transit entropy vs. T/\theta_{tr}, where T is temperature and
\theta_{tr} is a scaling temperature for each element. In the present paper, a
statistical mechanics model is constructed for the transit partition function,
and is calibrated to the experimental transit entropy curve. The model has two
scalar parameters, and captures the temperature scaling of experiment. The
calibrated model fits the experimental liquid entropy to high accuracy at all
temperatures. With no additional parameters, the model also agrees with both
experiment and molecular dynamics for the internal energy vs. T for Na. With
the calibrated transit model, V-T theory provides equations subject to ab
initio evaluation for thermodynamic properties of monatomic liquids. This will
allow the range of applicability of the theory, and its overall accuracy, to be
determined. More generally, the hypothesis of V-T theory, which divides the
many-atom potential energy valleys into random and symmetric classes, can also
be tested for its application beyond monatomic systems.

originates in a study of the interacting Bose gas. Permutations are weighted
according to point positions; the low-temperature onset of the appearance of
arbitrarily long cycles is connected to the phase transition of Bose-Einstein
condensates. In our simplified model, point positions are held fixed on the
fully occupied cubic lattice and interactions are expressed as Ewens-type
weights on cycle lengths of permutations. The critical temperature of the
transition to long cycles depends on an interaction-strength parameter
$\alpha$. For weak interactions, the shift in critical temperature is expected
to be linear in $\alpha$ with constant of linearity $c$. Using Markov chain
Monte Carlo methods and finite-size scaling, we find $c = 0.618 \pm 0.086$.
This finding matches a similar analytical result of Ueltschi and Betz. We also
examine the mean longest cycle length as a fraction of the number of sites in
long cycles, recovering an earlier result of Shepp and Lloyd for non-spatial

the sub-grid physics parameters on the evolution and the properties of the
galaxy formed in a low-mass dark matter halo (~7 times 10^10 Msun/h at redshift
z=0). The simulations are run within a cosmological setting with a nominal
resolution of 218 pc comoving and are stopped at z = 0.43. In all of our
simulations, an extended old/intermediate-age stellar halo and a more compact
younger stellar disk are formed. We found that a non negligible fraction of the
halo stars are formed in situ in a spheroidal distribution. Changes in the
sub-grid physics parameters affect significantly and in a complex way the
evolution and properties of the galaxy: (i) Lower threshold densities nsf
produce larger stellar effective radii Re, less peaked circular velocity curves
V_c(R), and greater amounts of low-density and hot gas in the disk mid-plane;
(ii) When stellar feedback is modeled by temporarily switching off radiative
cooling in the star forming regions, Re increases (by a factor of ~ 2 in our
particular model), the circular velocity curve becomes flatter, and a complex
multi-phase gaseous disk structure develops; (iii) A more efficient local
conversion of gas mass to stars, measured by a stellar particle mass
distribution biased toward larger values, increases the strength of the
feedback energy injection -driving outflows and inducing burstier SF histories;
iv) If feedback is too strong, gas loss by galactic outflows -which are easier
to produce in low-mass galaxies- interrupts SF, whose history becomes episodic.
The simulations exhibit two important shortcomings: the baryon fractions are
higher, and the specific SF rates are much smaller, than observationally
inferred values for redshifts ~ 0.4-1.

uncontaminated photometry and optical (red) spectroscopy, we select a spatially
compact object at a redshift of 5.563 (Ly-alpha) that shows a second emission
line, identified as N IV] 1486 A. The SED is modelled in a way that accounts
for both the N IV] line emission and the photometry in a self-consistent way.
The photoionization code CLOUDY is used to calculate a range of nebular models
as a function of stellar ionizing source temperature, ionization parameter,
density and nebular metallicity. We compare the theoretical and observed
magnitudes and search for the model parameters that also reproduce the observed
N IV] luminosity and equivalent width. A nebular model with a hot blackbody
ionizing source of around 100 kK and a nebular metallicity of ~5% of solar is
able to fit the observed SED and, in particular, explain the large apparent
Balmer break which is inferred from the pure stellar population model fitting
conventionally applied to multi-band photometric observations. In our model, an
apparent spectral break is produced by strong [O III] 4959, 5007 A emission
falling in one of the IR bands (IRAC1 in this case). A lower limit on the total
baryonic mass of a model of this type is 3.2 x 10^8 Msun . It is argued that
objects with Ly-alpha emission at high redshift that show an apparent Balmer
break may have their SED dominated by nebular emission and so could possibly be
identified with very young starbursting galaxies rather than massive evolved
stellar populations. Detailed studies of these emission nebulae with large
telescopes will provide a unique insight into very early chemical evolution.

homogeneous and bright sample of N~470 low redshift quasars extracted from
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (DR5). We approach the investigation from two
complementary directions: composite/median spectra and a set of line diagnostic
measures (asymmetry index, centroid shift and kurtosis) in individual quasars.
The project is developed and presented in the framework of the so-called 4D
Eigenvector 1 (4DE1) Parameter Space, with a focus on its optical dimensions,
FWHM(H_beta) and the relative strength of optical FeII
(R_FeII=W(FeII4434-4684)/W(H_beta)). We reenforce the conclusion that not all
quasars are alike and spectroscopically they do not distribute randomly about
an average typical optical spectrum. Our results give further support to the
concept of two populations A and B (narrower and broader than 4000 km/s
FWHM(H_beta), respectively) that emerged in the context of 4DE1 space. The
broad H_beta profiles in composite spectra of Population A sources are best
described by a Lorentzian and in Population B by a double Gaussian model.
Moreover, high and low accretion sources (an alternative view of the Population
A/B concept) not only show significant differences in terms of Black Hole (BH)
mass and Eddington ratio L_bol/L_Edd, but they also show distinct properties in
terms of line asymmetry, shift and shapes. We finally suggest that a potential
refinement of the 4DE1 space can be provided by separating two populations of
quasars at R_FeII~0.50 rather than at FWHM(H_beta)=4000 km/s. Concomitantly,
the asymmetry and centroid shift profile measures at 1/4 fractional intensity
can be reasonable surrogates for the FWHM(H_beta) dimension of the current
4DE1.

displacement, the information centrality and the Kirchhoff index. The relation
between the first two suggests that the node displacement has a better
resolution of the vulnerability than the information centrality, because the
latter is the sum of the local node displacement and the node displacement
averaged over the entire network.

FUSE spectra of this quasar and compared the results to Cloudy photoionization
and collisional ionization models in order to derive densities, temperatures,
and metallicities of the absorbing gas. The absorption can be explained by two
C III clouds, offset by 35 km/s in velocity, with metallicities of ~one-tenth
the solar value. One cloud has a density of order n_H = 1.2 +0.9 -0.5 * 10^-3
cm^-3 (thickness 0.4 +0.3 -0.2 kpc) and produces the observed C II and Si III
absorption, while the other has a density of order n_H = 1.2 +0.9 -0.5 * 10^-5
cm^-3 (thickness 80 +70 -40 kpc) and gives rise to the observed weak C IV
absorption. Cloud temperatures are ~14,000 +3000 -2000 K and ~34,000 -4000
+2000 K for photoionized models. Although collisionally ionized clouds with T ~
70,000 K are possible, they are less likely because of the short cooling
time-scales involved. Previous studies revealed no luminous galaxy at the
absorber's redshift, so it is probably related to tidal debris, ejected
material, a dwarf galaxy, or other halo material in a galaxy group. Our models
also indicate that one of the two clouds would produce detectable weak Mg II
absorption if spectral coverage of that transition existed. We predict what the
system would look like at z ~ 1 when the ionizing background radiation was more
intense. We find that at z ~ 1 the denser component resembles a C IV absorber.
The second C III cloud in this z = 0.0777 absorber may be analogous to a subset
of the more diffuse O VI absorbers at higher redshift.

usual absence of arbitrage assumption, we assume that one defaultable asset (at
least) looses value when the default occurs. We prove that under this
assumption, in some standard market filtrations, default times are totally
inaccessible stopping times; we therefore proceed to a systematic construction
of default times with particular emphasis on totally inaccessible stopping
times. Surprisingly, this abstract mathematical construction, reveals a very
specific and useful way in which default models can be built, using both market
factors and idiosyncratic factors. We then provide all the relevant
characteristics of a default time (i.e. the Az\'ema supermartingale and its
Doob-Meyer decomposition) given the information about these factors. We also
provide explicit formulas for the prices of defaultable claims and analyze the
risk premiums that form in the market in anticipation of losses which occur at
the default event. The usual reduced-form framework is extended in order to
include possible economic shocks, in particular jumps of the recovery process
at the default time. This formulas are not classic and we point out that the
knowledge of the default compensator or the intensity process is not anymore a

lines with a formation temperature of lg(T/K)=6.0. The corresponding upflow is

properties and electronic structure using a variety of methodologies. An
important cluster of boron is the B$_{12}$ cluster whose two main isomers have
distinct geometries, namely, icosahedral ($I_{h}$) and quasi planar ($C_{3v}$).
In this paper we investigate the linear optical absorption spectrum of these
two B$_{12}$ structures with the aim of examining the role of geometry on the
optical properties of clusters. The optical absorption calculations are
performed using both the semi-empirical and the ab initio approaches. The
semi-empirical approach uses a wave function methodology employing the INDO
model Hamiltonian, coupled with large-scale configuration interaction (CI)
calculations, to account for the electron-correlation effects. The \emph{ab
initio} calculations are performed within a
time-dependent-density-functional-theory (TDDFT) methodology. The results for
the two approaches are in very good qualitative agreement with each other.
Quantitatively speaking, results agree with each other in the lower energy
region, while in the higher energy region, features predicted by the TDDFT
approach are red-shifted as compared to the INDO-CI results. Both the
approaches predict that the optical absorption begins at much lower energies in
the icosahedral cluster as compared to the planar one, a fact which can be
utilized in experiments to distinguish between the two geometries. At higher
energies, both the isomers exhibit plasmon-like excitations. 73,1 4%

pulsation spectra of unprecedented richness and precision, in particular,
thousands of pulsating modes, and a clear distribution of amplitudes with
frequency. In the community, some scientists have started doubting about the
validity of the classical tools to analyze these very accurate light curves.
  This work provides the asteroseismic community with answers to this question
showing that (1) it is physically possible for a star to excite at a time and
with the observed amplitudes such a large number of modes; and (2) that the
kinetic energy accumulated in all those modes does not destroy the equilibrium
of the star. Consequently, mathematical tools presently applied in the analyses
of light curves can a priori be trusted. This conclusion is even more important
now, when a large amount of space data coming from Kepler are currently being
analyzed.
  The power spectrum of different stellar cases, and the non-adiabatic code
GraCo have been used to estimate the upper limit of the energy per second
required to excite all the observed modes, and their total kinetic energy. A
necessary previous step for this study is to infer the relative radial
pulsational amplitude from the observed photometric amplitude, scaling our
linear pulsational solutions to absolute values. The derived upper limits for
the required pulsational energy were compared with 1) the luminosity of the
star; and 2) the gravitational energy. We obtained that both upper energy
limits are orders of magnitude smaller.

relative surface density of CH stars which can provide valuable inputs to our
understanding on the role of low to intermediate-mass stars in the early
Galactic chemical evolution. Spectroscopic characterization provides an
effective way of identifying CH stars. The present analysis is aimed at a
quantitative assessment of the fraction of CH stars in a sample of stars using
a set of spectral classification criteria. The sample consists of 92 objects
selected from a collection of candidate Faint High Latitude Carbon stars from
the Hamburg/ESO survey. Medium resolution (R ~ 1300) spectra for these objects
were obtained using OMR at VBO, Kavalur and HFOSC at HCT, IAO, Hanle, during

36 of the 92 objects to be potential CH stars; combined with our earlier
studies (Goswami 2005, Goswami et al. 2007) this implies ~ 37% (of 243) objects

star candidates. Estimated effective temperatures, 12C/13C isotopic ratios and
their locations on the two colour J-H vs H-K plot are used to support their

In the pure material, intrinsic susceptibility and dynamics show a spin gap of
about . Substitution of non magnetic Zn or magnetic Ni impurity at Cu site
induces a staggered magnetization which results in a broadening of the 31P NMR
line, while susceptibility far from the defects is unaffected. The effect of Ni
on the NMR line broadening is twice that of Zn, which is consistent with
Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations assuming that Ni couples
ferromagnetically to its adjacent Cu. The induced moment follows a 1/T
temperature dependence due to the Curie-like development of the moment
amplitude while its extension saturates and does not depend on impurity content
or nature. This allow us to verify the generically expected scenario for
impurity doping and to extend it to magnetic impurity case: in an
antiferromagnetically correlated low dimensional spin system with
antiferromagnetic correlations, any type of impurity induces a staggered moment
at low temperature, whose extension is not linked to the impurity nature but to

techniques developed for one programming paradigm to another paradigm. In this
paper, we show how to adapt termination analysis techniques based on polynomial
interpretations - very well known in the context of term rewrite systems (TRSs)
- to obtain new (non-transformational) ter- mination analysis techniques for
definite logic programs (LPs). This leads to an approach that can be seen as a
direct generalization of the traditional techniques in termination analysis of
LPs, where linear norms and level mappings are used. Our extension general-
izes these to arbitrary polynomials. We extend a number of standard concepts
and results on termination analysis to the context of polynomial
interpretations. We also propose a constraint-based approach for automatically
generating polynomial interpretations that satisfy the termination conditions.
Based on this approach, we implemented a new tool, called Polytool, for
automatic termination analysis of LPs.

quantum-mechanical calculations for a variety of model potentials. We find a
very good overall numerical agreement between semiclassical and exact numerical

theorem"", shown to be valid (except for a small region around the classical

gravitationally lensed Lyman break galaxy (LBG), the `8 o'clock arc'. The
spectrum of the 8 o'clock arc is rich in stellar and interstellar medium (ISM)
features, and presents several similarities to the well-known MS1512-cB58 LBG.
The stellar photospheric absorption lines allowed us to constrain the systemic
redshift, z_sys = 2.7350+/-0.0003, of the galaxy, and derive its stellar
metallicity, Z=0.82 Z_sol. With a total stellar mass of ~4.2x10^{11} M_sol, the
8 o'clock arc agrees with the mass-metallicity relation found for z>2
star-forming galaxies. The 31 ISM absorption lines detected led to the
abundance measurements of 9 elements. The metallicity of the ISM, Z=0.65 Z_sol
(Si), is very comparable to the metallicity of stars and ionized gas, and
suggests that the ISM of the 8 o'clock arc has been rapidly polluted and
enriched by ejecta of OB stars. The ISM lines extend over ~1000 km/s and have
their peak optical depth blueshifted relative to the stars, implying gas
outflows of about -120 km/s. The Ly-alpha line is dominated by a damped
absorption profile on top of which is superposed a weak emission, redshifted
relative to the ISM lines by about +690 km/s and resulting from multiply

fully support the scenario proposed earlier, where the diversity of Ly-alpha
line profiles in LBGs and Ly-alpha emitters, from absorption to emission, is
mostly due to variations of HI column density and dust content (abridged).

are then ejected into the intracluster medium and take part in the formation of
a second stellar generation, explaining the peculiar distribution of chemical
elements among the cluster stars. We discuss the lithium yields from AGB stars
in the mass range 3-6.3 Msun, and from super-AGB stars of masses in the range

Although many uncertainties affect the other yields of these stars (e.g. O, Na

dramatically on the adopted description of mass loss. When we adopt our
standard mass loss formulation, very large yields are obtained especially for

ionization layers is not strong enough to excite high-order p-modes with
periods consistent with observed ones, all of which are found to be above the
acoustic cut-off frequencies of our models.
  The main (2.721 mHz) and the highest (2.806 mHz) frequencies are matched with
modified $l=2$ and $l=3$ modes, respectively. The large frequency separation
($\approx 68 \mu$Hz) is reproduced by models which lay within the error box of
HD 24712 on the HR diagram. The nearly equally spaced frequencies of HD 24712
indicate the small frequency separation to be as small as $\approx 0.5\mu$Hz.
However, the small separation derived from theoretical $l=1$ and 2 modes are
found to be larger than $\sim 3\mu$Hz. The problem of equal spacings could be
resolved by assuming that the spacings correspond to pairs of $l=2$ and $l=0$
modes. The amplitude distribution on the stellar surface is strongly affected
by the magnetic field resulting in the predominant concentration at the polar
regions.

the galactic plane(s), whereas other regions are not probed at all. Interacting
galaxies offer an alternative, because extended tidal tails often probe outer
or off-plane regions of galaxies. However, these systems are neither in
dynamical equilibrium nor simple, because they are composed of two or more
galaxies, by this increasing the associated parameter space.We present our
genetic algorithm based modeling tool which allows to investigate the extended
parameter space of interacting galaxies. From these studies, we derive the
dynamical history of (well observed) galaxies. Among other parameters we
constrain the dark matter content of the involved galaxies. We demonstrate the
applicability of this strategy with examples ranging from stellar streams
around theMilkyWay to extended tidal tails, from proto-typical binary galaxies
(like M51 or the Antennae system) to small group of galaxies.

The problem to define a Lorentz invariant stochastic dynamics for the
wave-function is solved by assuming that the stochastic time flow is running
orthogonal to the deterministic, unitary time evolution inside the
four-dimensional space-time, which makes the direction of causality independent
from the chosen reference frame. This new view allows to accept Bell's position
on the implication of quantum non-locality on relativity, without having to
give up the Lorentz invariance of the specified dynamics. It is shown that it
is possible to formulate on the basis of this new view a meaningful physical

provide new starting points for experimental research.

variable, on all sampled time scales. We did not observe any absorption
features in either the soft or hard X-ray band. We found weak evidence for the
presence of an iron line at ~6.8 keV, which is indicative of emission from
highly ionized iron. The 2-10 keV band spectrum is well fitted by a simple
power law model, whose slope steepens with increasing flux, similar to what is
observed in other Seyferts as well. The soft excess is variable both in flux
and shape, and it can be well described by a low-temperature Comptonisation
model, whose slope flattens with increasing flux. The soft excess flux
variations are moderately correlated with the hard band variations, and we
found weak evidence that they are leading them by ~20 ksec. Our results rule
out a jet origin for the bulk of the X-ray emission in this object. The
observed hard band spectral variations suggest intrinsic continuum slope
variations, caused by changes in the ""heating/cooling"" ratio of the hot corona.
The low-temperature Comptonising medium, responsible for the soft excess
emission, could be a hot layer in the inner disc of the source, which appears
due to the fact that the source is accreting at a super-Eddington rate. The
soft excess flux and spectral variations could be caused by random variations
of the accretion rate.

taken in spring 2009, using the 1.2m Oskar-Luhning telescope (OLT) of Hamburg
Observatory and the 2.2m telescope at Calar Alto Observatory using BUSCA (Bonn
University Simultaneous CAmera). Both the new OLT data, taken with the same
instrumental setup as our data taken in 2008, as well as the simultaneously
recorded multicolor BUSCA data confirm the low inclination values reported
previously, and in fact suggest that the TrES-2b exoplanet has already passed
the first inclination threshold (i_min,1 = 83.417) and is not eclipsing the
full stellar surface any longer. Using the multi-band BUSCA data we demonstrate
that the multicolor light curves can be consistently fitted with a given set of
limb darkening coefficients without the need to adjust these coefficients, and
further, we can demonstrate that wavelength dependent stellar radius changes
must be small as expected from theory. Our new observations provide further
evidence for a change of the orbit inclination of the transiting extrasolar
planet TrES-2b reported previously. We examine in detail possible causes for
this inclination change and argue that the observed change should be
interpreted as nodal regression. While the assumption of an oblate host star
requires an unreasonably large second harmonic coefficient, the existence of a
third body in the form of an additional planet would provide a very natural
explanation for the observed secular orbit change. Given the lack of clearly
observed short-term variations of transit timing and our observed secular nodal
regression rate, we predict a period between approximately 50 and 100 days for

detectable with present-day radial velocity (RV) techniques.

nonrelativistic potential scattering we investigate new variational
approximations in this framework. By means of the Feynman-Jensen variational
principle and the most general ansatz quadratic in the velocity variables --
over which one has to integrate functionally -- we obtain variational equations
which contain classical elements (trajectories) as well as quantum-mechanical
ones (wave spreading).We analyse these equations and solve them numerically by
iteration, a procedure best suited at high energy. The first correction to the
variational result arising from a cumulant expansion is also evaluated.
Comparison is made with exact partial-wave results for scattering from a
Gaussian potential and better agreement is found at large scattering angles
where the standard eikonal-type approximations fail.

substitutions. Unlike existing research, the paper regards simplex subdivisions
as new perspectives to study variable substitutions, gives some subdivisions of
the simplex T_n, introduces the concept of convergence of the subdivision
sequence, and presents a sufficient and necessary condition for the convergent
self-similar subdivision sequence. Then the relationships between subdivisions
and their corresponding substitutions are established. Moreover, it is proven
that if the form F is indefinite on T_n and the sequence of the successive
L-substitution sets is convergent, then the sequence of sets {SLS^(m)(F)} is
negatively terminating, and an algorithm for deciding indefinite forms with a
counter-example is obtained. Thus, various effective substitutions for deciding
positive semi-definite forms and indefinite forms are gained, which are beyond
the weighted difference substitutions characterized by ""difference"".

  co-existence of spin glass phase and incommensurate short-range spin order","14 pages, 20 figures",,,,"cond-mat.dis-nn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stage-2 MnCl$_{2}$ GIC magnetically behaves like a quasi 2D $XY$
antiferromagnet on the triangular lattice. It shows a typical spin glass
behavior below the spin freezing temperature $T_{SG}$ (= 1.1 K). The AC
magnetic susceptibility shows a peak at $T$ = $T_{SG}$ at $H$ = 0. This peak
shifts to the low temperature side with increasing $H$, according to the de
Almeida-Thouless critical line. We have undertaken an extensive study on the
$T$ dependence of specific heat in the absence of an external field $H$ and in
the presence of $H$ along the $c$ plane. The magnetic specific heat $C_{mag}$
at $H$ = 0 shows no anomaly at $T_{SG}$, but exhibits double broad peaks around
5 K and 41 K. The magnetic specific heat $C_{mag}$ at $H$ = 0 is described by
$C_{mag} \propto (1/T^{2})\exp(-\Delta/T)$ with $\Delta = 1.41 \pm 0.03$ K,
while $C_{mag}$ at $H$ = 10 kOe is proportional to $T$. The entropy due to the
broad peak around 5 K is 1/3 of the total entropy. The residual entropy is 63 %
of the total entropy because of highly frustrated nature of the system. The
magnetic neutron scattering indicates that a short range spin order associated
with the incommensurate wave vector $| {\bf Q}_{incomm}|$ ($= 0.522 \AA^{-1}$
at 0.45 K) appears below 5 K and remains unchanged down to 63 mK. The in-plane
spin correlation length is only 18 $\AA$ at 0.45 K. The low temperature phase
below $T_{SG}$ is a kind of reentrant spin glass phase where the spin glass
phase coexists with a short range spin order associated with $| {\bf
Q}_{incomm}|$.

bilayer quantum Hall system is studied. This state can be considered as a gas
of superfluid electron-hole pairs with the components of the pair belonging to
different layers. Superfluid flux of such pairs is equivalent to two electrical
supercurrents in the layers. It is shown that the state with the interlayer
phase coherence emerges in the graphene system if a certain imbalance of the
Landau level filling factors of the layers is created. We obtain the
temperature of transition into the superfluid state, the maximum interlayer
distance at which the phase coherence is possible, and the critical values of
the supercurrent. The advantages of use of graphene systems instead of GaAs
heterostructures for the realization of the bilayer electron-hole
superconductivity is discussed.
