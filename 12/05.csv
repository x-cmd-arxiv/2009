is an improvement over other matched-filter methods, most notably through
implementing redshift slicing of the data to significantly reduce line-of-sight
projections and related false positives. We apply our method to the
Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) Deep fields, finding ~170
galaxy clusters per square degree in the 0.2 <= z <= 1.0 redshift range. Future
surveys such as LSST and JDEM can exploit 3D-MF's automated methodology to
produce complete and reliable galaxy cluster catalogues. We determine the
reliability and accuracy of the statistical approach of our method through a
thorough analysis of mock data from the Millennium Simulation. We detect
clusters with 100% completeness for M_200 >= 3.0x10^(14)M_sun, 88% completeness
for M_200 >= 1.0x10^(14)M_sun, and 72% completeness well into the 10^(13)M_sun

1.5x10^(13)M_sun and a 16% false detection rate for galaxy clusters >~
5x10^(13)M_sun, reporting that for clusters with masses <~ 5x10^(13)M_sun false
detections may increase up to ~24%. Utilising these selection functions we
conclude that our galaxy cluster catalogue is the most complete CFHTLS Deep

independent degrees of freedom: the MOND metric g_mn, to which alone matter
couples, and an auxiliary metric g*_mn. The main idea hinges on the fact that
we can form tensors from the difference, C^a_bc, of the Levi-Civita connections
of the two metrics, and these act like gravitational accelerations. In the
context of MOND we can form dimensionless `acceleration' scalars, and functions
thereof, from contractions of C^a_bc/a0. I look at a class of bimetric MOND
theories governed by an action with the gravitational Lagrangian density b
sqrt(g)R+a sqrt(g*) R* -2(gg*)^{1/4}f(k)a0^2M(U/a0^2), and with matter actions
I(g_mn,psi)+I*(g*_mn,chi), with U a scalar quadratic in the C^a_bc,
k=(g/g*)^{1/4}, and allowing for the existence of twin matter, chi, that
couples to g*_mn alone. In particular, I concentrate on one interesting and
simple choice of the scalar U. This theory introduces only one new constant,
a0; it tends simply to General Relativity in the limit a0 goes to 0, and to a
phenomenologically valid MOND theory in the nonrelativistic limit. The theory
naturally gives MOND and ""dark energy"" effects from the same term in the
action, both controlled by the MOND constant a0. As regards gravitational
lensing by nonrelativistic systems--a holy grail for relativistic MOND
theories--the theory predicts that the same potential that controls
massive-particle motion also dictates lensing in the same way as in GR. This
last result can be modified with other choices of U, but lensing is still
enhanced and MOND-like, with an effective logarithmic potential.

the basic Leggett inequalities are derived in the most general way, i.e. no

some wave function, or from some set of classical variables. The consequence is
that as long as one and the same probability distribution is used in the
calculus of all the averages appearing in the basic Leggett inequalities, no
contradiction may occur. These inequalities may be violated only when different
averages are calculated with different distributions, for example, some of them
calculated with the quantum formalism and the others with some distribution of

positron energy injection. Beacom and Yueksel (2006) suggested a method to
estimate this energy from the ratio of the 511 keV line to the MeV in-flight

injection energy of positron should be about several MeV that cut down
significantly a class of models of positron origin in the GC assuming that
positrons lose their energy by Coulomb collisions only. However, observations
show that the strength of magnetic field in the GC is much higher than in other

these conditions, synchrotron losses of positrons are significant that extends
the range of acceptable values of positron injection energy. We show that if

error measure or scoring function, such as the absolute error or the squared
error. The individual scores are then averaged over forecast cases, to result
in a summary measure of the predictive performance, such as the mean absolute
error or the (root) mean squared error. I demonstrate that this common practice
can lead to grossly misguided inferences, unless the scoring function and the
forecasting task are carefully matched.
  Effective point forecasting requires that the scoring function be specified
ex ante, or that the forecaster receives a directive in the form of a
statistical functional, such as the mean or a quantile of the predictive
distribution. If the scoring function is specified ex ante, the forecaster can
issue the optimal point forecast, namely, the Bayes rule. If the forecaster
receives a directive in the form of a functional, it is critical that the
scoring function be consistent for it, in the sense that the expected score is
minimized when following the directive.
  A functional is elicitable if there exists a scoring function that is
strictly consistent for it. Expectations, ratios of expectations and quantiles
are elicitable. For example, a scoring function is consistent for the mean
functional if and only if it is a Bregman function. It is consistent for a
quantile if and only if it is generalized piecewise linear. Similar
characterizations apply to ratios of expectations and to expectiles. Weighted
scoring functions are consistent for functionals that adapt to the weighting in
peculiar ways. Not all functionals are elicitable; for instance, conditional
value-at-risk is not, despite its popularity in quantitative finance.

model, an optically thick disk in the BH equatorial plane produces thermal seed
photons with polarization oriented parallel to the disk surface. These seed
photons are then inverse-Compton scattered through a hot (but thermal) corona,
producing a hard X-ray power-law spectrum. We consider three different models
for the corona geometry: a wedge ``sandwich'' with aspect ratio H/R and
vertically-integrated optical depth tau_0 constant throughout the disk; an
inhomogeneous ``clumpy'' corona with a finite number of hot clouds distributed
randomly above the disk within a wedge geometry; and a spherical corona of
uniform density, centered on the BH and surrounded by a truncated thermal disk
with inner radius R_edge. In all cases we find a characteristic transition from
horizontal polarization at low energies to vertical polarization above the
thermal peak; the vertical direction is defined as the projection of the BH
spin axis on the plane of the sky. We show how the details of the
spectropolarization signal can be used to distinguish between these models and
infer various properties of the corona and BH. Although the bulk of this paper

describe a method based on the use of some shape variables to discriminate
events according their topologies. A very attractive feature of this analysis

detected. The X-ray properties in the 0.3--10 keV band have been compiled and
presented based on analyses with XMM-Newton, Chandra, Suzaku, and the Swift XRT
(Winter et al. 2009). Additionally, we have compiled a sub-sample of sources
with medium resolution optical ground-based spectra from the SDSS or our own
observations at KPNO. In this sample of 60 sources, we have classified the
sources using standard emission line diagnostic plots, obtained masses for the
broad line sources through measurement of the broad H$\beta$ emission line, and
measured the [OIII] 5007\AA luminosity of this sample. Based on continuum fits
to the intrinsic absorption features, we have obtained clues about the stellar
populations of the host galaxies. We now present the highlights of our X-ray
and optical studies of this unique sample of local AGNs, including a comparison
of the 2--10 keV and 14--195 keV X-ray luminosities with the [OIII] 5007\AA
luminosity and the implications of our results towards measurements of
bolometric luminosities.

extensive legacy science to the boundaries of the visible universe. The mission
is optimised for two primary cosmological probes: Weak gravitational Lensing
(WL) and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). Euclid's wide survey will cover
20,000 deg2, measuring shapes and redshifts of galaxies to redshift 2. For weak
lensing, Euclid will measure the shape of over 2 billion galaxies with a
density of 30-40 resolved galaxies per arcmin2 in one broad visible R+I+Z band
(550-920 nm) down to AB mag 24.5 (10sigma). The photometric redshifts for these
galaxies are derived from three additional Euclid NIR bands (Y,J,H in the range
0.92-2.0 micron) reaching AB mag 24 (5sigma) in each, complemented by
photometry from ground based surveys. The BAO are determined from a NIR
spectroscopic survey with a redshift accuracy of dz/(1+z) =0.001. The baseline
payload consists of a Korsch telescope with a primary mirror of 1.2 m diameter
and is designed to provide a large field of view (0.5 deg2) to three scientific
instruments: (1) VIS: a CCD based optical imaging channel, (2) NIP: a NIR
imaging photometry channel, and (3) NIS: a NIR spectrometric channel. This
report presents an overview of the assessment study phase of the Euclid

The discussion is carried out within the extended Hubbard model and the method

(Euclidean or flat) metric--that a generic (nine-dimensional) real two-qubit
system is separable, by implementing the well-known Peres-Horodecki test on the
partial transposes (PT's) of the associated 4 x 4 density matrices). But the
full implementation of the test--requiring that the determinant of the PT be
nonnegative for separability to hold--appears to be, at least presently,
computationally intractable. So, we have previously implemented--using the
auxiliary concept of a diagonal-entry-parameterized separability function
(DESF)--the weaker implied test of nonnegativity of the six 2 x 2 principal
minors of the PT. This yielded an exact upper bound on the separability
probability of 1024/{135 pi^2} =0.76854$. Here, we piece together
(reflection-symmetric) results obtained by requiring that each of the four 3 x
3 principal minors of the PT, in turn, be nonnegative, giving an
improved/reduced upper bound of 22/35 = 0.628571. Then, we conclude that a
still further improved upper bound of 1129/2100 = 0.537619 can be found by
similarly piecing together the (reflection-symmetric) results of enforcing the
simultaneous nonnegativity of certain pairs of the four 3 x 3 principal minors.
In deriving our improved upper bounds, we rely repeatedly upon the use of
certain integrals over cubes that arise. Finally, we apply an independence
assumption to a pair of DESF's that comes close to reproducing our numerical
estimate of the true separability function.

factor f = 0.05-0.12, electron densities and ionized masses are in the range
10-16 cm^-3 and 450-700 Mo, respectively. The analysis of the HI gas emission
distribution allowed the identification of 5900 Mo of neutral atomic gas with
velocities between -52 and -43 km/s probably linked to the nebula. The region
of the nebula is almost free of molecular gas. Only four small clumps were

small infrared shell-like source linked to the inner ring, which is also

nebulae are likely to be coeval and to represent two manifestations of the same
single star formation episode with about 1 Myr age. The near-IR nebula reveals
an embedded, optically and near-IR invisible source whose light scatters off a
cavity carved by previous stellar jets or molecular outflows and into our
line-of-sight. The molecular cloud is fully covered by our CO(J=1-0) maps and,
traced by this line, extends over a region of 7.8 x 7.8 pc^2, exhibiting an
angular size 5.4' x 5.4' and shape (close to circular) similar to spherical (or

masses of the host galaxies of 70 low redshift SN Ia (0.015 < z < 0.08) from
the hosts' absolute luminosities and mass-to-light ratios. These nearby SN were
discovered largely by searches targeting luminous galaxies, and we find that
their host galaxies are substantially more massive than the hosts of SN
discovered by the flux-limited Supernova Legacy Survey. Testing four separate
light curve fitters, we detect ~2.5{\sigma} correlations of Hubble residuals
with both host galaxy size and stellar mass, such that SN Ia occurring in
physically larger, more massive hosts are ~10% brighter after light curve
correction. The Hubble residual is the deviation of the inferred distance
modulus to the SN, calculated from its apparent luminosity and light curve
properties, away from the expected value at the SN redshift. Marginalizing over
linear trends in Hubble residuals with light curve parameters shows that the
correlations cannot be attributed to a light curve-dependent calibration error.
Combining 180 higher-redshift ESSENCE, SNLS, and HigherZ SN with 30 nearby SN
whose host masses are less than 10^10.8 solar masses in a cosmology fit yields
1+w=0.22 +0.152/-0.143, while a combination where the 30 nearby SN instead have
host masses greater than 10^10.8 solar masses yields 1+w=-0.03 +0.217/-0.108.
Progenitor metallicity, stellar population age, and dust extinction correlate
with galaxy mass and may be responsible for these systematic effects. Host
galaxy measurements will yield improved distances to SN Ia.

for a long time since the very inception of WiMAX networks. WiMAX offers
advantages particularly in terms of Quality of service it offers over a longer
range at the MAC level. In our work, we propose two credit based scheduling
schemes one in which completed flows distributes the left over credits equally
to all higher priority uncompleted flows(ODRREDC) and another in which
completed flows give away all the excess credits to the highest priority
uncompleted flow(ODRRSDC). Both the schemes are compatible with 802.16 MAC
protocol and can efficiently serve real time bursty traffic with reduced
latency and hence improved QOS for real time flows. We compare the two proposed
schemes for their latency, bandwidth utilization and throughput for real time
burst flows with the opportunity based Deficit Round Robin scheduling scheme.
While the ODRR scheduler focuses on reducing the credits for the flows with
errors, our approach also distributes these remaining credits together with the
credits from completed flows equally among the higher priority uncompleted
flows or totally to the highest priority uncompleted flow.

Automation is changing the nature of the laboratories, and there is a long
running debate about the value of hands on versus simulated and remote
laboratories. The remote lab technology has brought a significant improvement
in communication within the Academic community and has improved students
learning experiences. There are different educational objectives as criteria
for judging the laboratories: Hands on advocates emphasize design skills, while
remote lab advocates focus on conceptual understanding. Remote laboratories
offer all the advantages of the new technology, but are often a poor
replacement for real laboratory work. Remote laboratories are similar to
simulation techniques in that they require minimal space and time, because the
experiments can be rapidly configured and run over the Internet [Web]. But
unlike simulations, they provide real data. This paper presents a comparative
analysis for the educational objectives of the three laboratory techniques,
hands on, simulated, and remote laboratories. In addition, it proposes
enhancements for the remote lab activities leading to improving its

Whether the core mass function has a powerlaw tail or whether it follows a pure

it is estimated that datasets from uniform surveys containing more than
approximately 500 cores with a completeness limit below the peak of the mass

considering the binomial distribution expected from the observed number of

intrinsic standard deviation in the fraction of passive galaxies is consistent
with a small value of <0.1 in most mass bins for all three samples. There is no

is a ""semi"" quark gluon plasma (semi-QGP), where the expectation value of the
(renormalized) Polyakov loop is less than one. This can be modeled by a
semiclassical expansion about a constant field for the vector potential, A_0,
which is diagonal in color. We compute the shear viscosity in the semi-QGP by
using the Boltzmann equation in the presence of this background field. To
leading, logarithmic order in weak coupling, the dominant diagrams are given by
the usual scattering processes of 2 -> 2 particles. For simplicity we also
assume that both the number of colors and flavors are large. Near the critical
temperature T_c, where the expectation value of the Polyakov loop is small, the
overall density of colored fields decreases according to their color
representation, with the density of quarks vanishes linearly with the loop, and
that of gluons, quadratically. This decrease in the overall density dominates
changes in the transport cross section. As a result, relative to that in the
perturbative QGP, near T_c the shear viscosity in the semi-QGP is suppressed by
two powers of the Polyakov loop. In a semiclassical expansion, the suppression
of colored fields depends only upon which color representation they lie in, and
not upon their mass. That light and heavy quarks are suppressed in a common
manner may help to explain the behavior of charm quarks at RHIC.

is present on multiple timescales including days to months; however, no clear
signature of periodicity is present on the timescales probed by these data. If
binary modulation is present and dominating the measured variability, then the
period of the orbit is likely to be more than 54 days (half of this campaign),
or it has a shorter period with a variable degree of flux modulation on
successive high states. If the two high states measured to date are due to
binary modulation, then the favored period is approximately 35-40 days. More
observations are required to determine if this object is truly a binary system

flaring effects or periodic binary modulation.

dynamical estimates of the content of the Oort Cloud, we find that Kepler's

mass of the Oort cloud, the distance to its ""inner edge"", and the size

occultations by Kuiper Belt or main belt asteroids, mainly due to the fact that
it is observing a high ecliptic latitude field. Occultations by Solar System

nonequilibrium can reproduce the observations by performing hydrodynamic
simulations based on steady coronal heating that decreases exponentially with
height. We consider both monolithic and multi-stranded loops. The simulations
successfully reproduce certain aspects of the observations, including the
excess density, but each of them fails in at least one critical way. Monolithic
models have far too much intensity structure, while multi-strand models are
either too structured or too long-lived. Our results appear to rule out the
widespread existence of heating that is both highly concentrated low in the
corona and steady or quasi-steady (slowly varying or impulsive with a rapid
cadence). Active regions would have a very different appearance if the dominant
heating mechanism had these properties. Thermal nonequilibrium may nonetheless
play an important role in prominences and catastrophic cooling events (e.g.,
coronal rain) that occupy a small fraction of the coronal volume. However,
apparent inconsistencies between the models and observations of cooling events

operator algebra theory to study certain aspects of the classical umbral
calculus and we introduce and study certain operators generalizing the
classical umbral shifts. We begin by calculating the exponential generating
function of the higher derivatives of a composite function, following a short,
elementary proof which naturally arose as a motivating computation related to a
certain crucial ""associativity"" property of an important class of vertex
operator algebras. Very similar (somewhat forgotten) proofs had appeared by the
19-th century, of course without any motivation related to vertex operator
algebras. Using this formula, we derive certain results, including especially
the calculation of certain adjoint operators, of the classical umbral calculus.
This is, roughly speaking, a reversal of the logical development of some
standard treatments, which have obtained formulas for the higher derivatives of
a composite function, most notably Fa\`a di Bruno's formula, as a consequence
of umbral calculus. We set our results in the context of some standard material
in what seems a natural fashion given our point of view. We also show a
connection between the Virasoro algebra and the classical umbral shifts. This
leads naturally to a more general class of operators, which we introduce, and
which include the classical umbral shifts as a special case. We prove a few
basic facts about these operators.

  Cooperative Multicell Systems","28 pages, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Base station cooperation improves the sum-rates that can be achieved in
cellular systems. Conventional cooperation techniques require sharing large
amounts of information over finite-capacity backhaul links and assume that base
stations have full channel state information (CSI) of all the active users in
the system. In this paper, a new limited feedback strategy is proposed for
multicell beamforming where cooperation is restricted to sharing only the CSI
of active users among base stations. The system setup considered is a linear
array of cells based on the Wyner model. Each cell contains single-antenna
users and multi-antenna base stations. Closed-form expressions for the
beamforming vectors that approximately maximize the sum-rates in a multicell
system are first presented, assuming full CSI at the transmitter. For the more
practical case of a finite-bandwidth feedback link, CSI of the desired and
interfering channels is quantized at the receiver before being fed back to the
base station. An upper bound on the mean loss in sum rate due to random vector
quantization is derived. A new feedback-bit allocation strategy, to partition
the available bits between the desired and interfering channels, is developed
to approximately minimize the mean loss in sum-rate due to quantization. The
proposed feedback-bit partitioning algorithm is shown, using simulations, to
yield sum-rates close to the those obtained using full CSI at base stations.

population synthesis models have shown that the migration of protoplanets

find physical effects that slow down, halt or even reverse migration. Many of
these studies rely on the horseshoe drag, whose long term-evolution (saturated
or not) is intimately related to the disk viscosity in laminar disk models. We
investigate how the horseshoe drag exerted on a low-mass planet is altered by a
more realistic treatment of the turbulence in protoplanetary disks.
Two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations are performed with a turbulence model
that reproduces the main turbulence properties of three-dimensional
magnetohydrodynamic calculations. We find that the horseshoe drag can remain
unsaturated on the long term, depending on the turbulence strength. We show
that the desaturation of the horseshoe drag by turbulence can be modeled by
vortensity diffusion across the time-averaged planet's horseshoe region. At
low-turbulence, the running-time averaged torque is in good agreement with the
total torque obtained for an equivalent laminar model, with a similar
vortensity's diffusion coefficient. At high-turbulence, differences arise due
to the time-evolution of the averaged density profile with turbulence.

eruption frequency for bipolar magnetic regions is essentially scale free over
at least two orders of magnitude, from eruptions near the arcsecond resolution
limit of TRACE to the largest coronal mass ejections observed in the inner
heliosphere. This scale range may be associated with the properties of the
nested set of ranges of connectivity in the magnetic field, in which
increasingly large and energetic events can reach higher and higher into the
corona until the heliosphere is reached.

accretion because the initial t_acc phase is over by the time the starburst is

earlier, when the observed massive clumps first formed, could have been driven
by accretion energy. The combined observations of a high relative velocity
dispersion in the gas of z~2 clumpy galaxies and a gas mass comparable to the

using various techniques, the researchers are always finding alternative

a single point of bottleneck as it handles more and more mobile nodes (MNs). A
number of schemes have been proposed to achieve load balancing among different

also avoid the effect of the number of CNs. Also only the balancing of MN is
performed, but not the balancing of the actual traffic load, since CN of each
MN may be different. This paper proposes an efficient admission control

control algorithm is based on the number of serving CNs and achieves actual
load balancing among MAPs. Moreover, a replacement mechanism is introduced to

trilinear $\phi\chi^2$ interactions in an expanding Universe is studied. In
$\lambda\phi^4/4$ inflationary model the trilinear interaction, in contrast to
the four-legs $\phi^2\chi^2$, breaks the conformal symmetry explicitly and the
resonant source term becomes non-periodic, making the Floquet theorem
inapplicable. We find that the occupation number of the produced
$\chi$-particles has a non-linear exponential growth with exponent $\sim
x^{3/2}$, where $x$ is the conformal time. This should be contrasted with
preheating from a periodic resonant source, arising for example from the
four-legs $\phi^2\chi^2$ interaction, where the occupation number has a linear
exponential growth. We present an analytic method to compute the interference
term coming from phases accumulated in non-tachyonic scattering regions and
show that the effects of the interference term causes ripples on $x^{3/2}$
curve, a result which is confirmed by numerical analysis. Studying the effects
of back-reaction of the $\chi$-particles, we show that tachyonic resonance
preheating in our model can last long enough to transfer most of the energy
from the background inflation field $\phi$, providing an efficient model for
preheating in the chaotic inflation models.

relay wireless network, in which a source-destination pair both equipped with
multiple antennas communicates through a large number of half-duplex
amplify-and-forward (AF) relay terminals. Two novel linear beamforming schemes
based on the matched filter (MF) and regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding
techniques are proposed for the MIMO relay system. We focus on the linear
process at the relay nodes and design the new relay beamformers by utilizing
the channel state information (CSI) of both backward channel and forward
channel. The proposed beamforming designs are based on the QR decomposition
(QRD) filter at the destination node which performs successive interference
cancellation (SIC) to achieve the maximum spatial multiplexing gain. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed beamformers that fulfil both the
intranode array gain and distributed array gain outperform other relaying
schemes under different system parameters in terms of the ergodic capacity.

generalized intersection matrices introduced by P. Slodowy such that they are
symmetrizable. Every such matrix can be naturally associated with a root basis
and a Weyl root system. Using $d$-fold affinization matrices we give a
classification, up to braid-equivalence, for all positive semi-definite
symmetrizable intersection matrices. We also give an explicit structure of the
Weyl root system for each $d$-fold affinization matrix in terms of the root
system of the corresponding Cartan matrix and some special null roots.

the framework of a modified perturbation theory (MPT) treating resonant
contributions in the sense of distributions. The cross-section of the process
is calculated within the NNLO of the MPT in a model that admits exact solution.
Universal massless-particles contributions are taken into consideration. A
comparison of the outcomes with the exact solution demonstrates excellent
convergence of the MPT series at the energies near and above the maximum of the
cross-section.

incompressible Euler equations. These were introduced by R.DiPerna and A.Majda,
and in particular global existence to any L2 initial data was proven. Whether
measure-valued solutions agree with classical solutions if the latter exist has
apparently remained open. We also show that DiPerna's measure-valued solutions
to systems of conservation laws have the weak-strong uniqueness property.

gauge field in a specific four dimensional AdS membrane embedded in a five
dimensional space-time. The membrane is generated from a deformation of the
$\lambda \phi^4$ potential and belongs to a new class of defect solutions. In
this context we find resonance structures in the analysis of massive modes. The
study of deformed defects is important because they contain internal structures
and these may have implications to the way the background space-time is
constructed and the way its curvature behaves. The main objective here is to
observe the contributions of the deformation procedure to the resonances and
the well known field localization methods.
