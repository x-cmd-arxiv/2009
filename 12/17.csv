component of the large scale distribution of matter and galaxies in the
Universe. They are of instrumental importance for understanding the emergence
of the Cosmic Web. Their relatively simple shape and structure makes them into
useful tools for extracting the value of a variety cosmic parameters, possibly
including even that of the influence of dark energy. Perhaps most promising and
challenging is the issue of the galaxies found within their realm. Not only
does the pristine environment of voids provide a promising testing ground for
assessing the role of environment on the formation and evolution of galaxies,
the dearth of dwarf galaxies may even represent a serious challenge to the
standard view of cosmic structure formation.

is invariant under half of the supercharges of the theory and is dual to the

addition to the gauge and scalar fields of the theory, also to the fermions in
the bi-fundamental representation of the U(N) x U(M) gauge group. These
ingredients are naturally combined into a superconnection whose holonomy gives
the Wilson loop, which can be defined for any representation of the supergroup
U(N|M). Explicit expressions for loops supported along an infinite straight

how branes back-react onto the bulk geometry, since this can dramatically
affect the system's low-energy properties. Yet the practical use of this
observation for model building is so far mostly restricted to branes having
only one transverse dimension (codimension-1) in the bulk space, since this is
where tools for following back-reaction are well-developed. This is likely a
serious limitation since experience also tells us that one dimension is rarely
representative of what happens in higher dimensions. We here summarize recent
progress on developing the matching conditions that describe how codimension-2
branes couple to bulk metric, gauge and scalar fields. These matching
conditions are then applied to three situations: D7-branes in F-theory
compactifications of 10D Type IIB string vacua; 3-branes coupled to bulk axions
in unwarped and non-supersymmetric 6D systems; and 3-branes coupled to chiral,
gauged 6D supergravity. For each it is shown how the resulting brane-bulk
dynamics is reproduced by the scalar potential for the low-energy moduli in the
dimensionally reduced, on-brane effective theory. For 6D supergravity we show
that the only 4D-maximally symmetric bulk geometries supported by
positive-tension branes are flat.

large lepton flavour violating rates are compatible with successful

6946, display a prominent large-scale spiral structure in their gaseous outer
disk. Such structure is often thought to pose a dynamical puzzle, because
grand-design spiral structure is traditionally interpreted as the result of
density waves carried mostly in the stellar disk. Aims. Here we argue that the
outer spiral arms in the cold gas outside the bright optical disk actually have
a natural interpretation as the manifestation of the mechanism that excites
grand-design spiral structure in the main, star-dominated body of the disk: the
excitation is driven by angular momentum transport to the outer regions,
through trailing density waves outside the corotation circle that can penetrate
beyond the Outer Lindblad Resonance in the gaseous component of the disk.
  Methods: Because of conservation of the density wave action, these outgoing
waves are likely to become more prominent in the outer disk and eventually
reach non-linear amplitudes. To calculate the desired amplitude profiles, we
make use of the theory of dispersive waves.
  Results: If the conditions beyond the optical radius allow for an approximate
treatment in terms of a linear theory, we show that fitting the observed
amplitude profiles leads to a quantitative test on the density of the disk
material and thus on the dark matter distribution in the outer parts of the
galaxy.
  Conclusions: This study is thus of interest to the general problem of the
disk-halo decomposition of rotation curves.

stars that have ever formed, and spans the IR-UV range. The interaction of
very-high-energy (VHE: E>100 GeV) gamma-rays, emitted by sources located at
cosmological distances, with the intervening EBL results in electron-positron
pair production that leads to energy-dependent attenuation of the observed VHE
flux. This introduces a fundamental ambiguity in the interpretation of the
measured VHE blazar spectra: neither the intrinsic spectra, nor the EBL, are
separately known - only their combination is. In this paper we propose a method
to measure the EBL photon number density. It relies on using simultaneous
observations of blazars in the optical, X-ray, high-energy (HE: E>100 MeV)
gamma-ray (from the Fermi telescope), and VHE gamma-ray (from Cherenkov
telescopes) bands. For each source, the method involves best-fitting the
spectral energy distribution (SED) from optical through HE gamma-rays (the
latter being largely unaffected by EBL attenuation as long as z<1) with a
Synchrotron Self-Compton (SSC) model. We extrapolate such best-fitting models
into the VHE regime, and assume they represent the blazars' intrinsic emission.
Contrasting measured versus intrinsic emission leads to a determination of the
gamma-gamma opacity to VHE photons - hence, upon assuming a specific cosmology,
we derive the EBL photon number density. Using, for each given source,
different states of emission will only improve the accuracy of the proposed
method. We demonstrate this method using recent simultaneous multi-frequency
observations of the blazar PKS2155-304 and discuss how similar observations can
more accurately probe the EBL.

we focus by analytical means on aspects of the phase diagram which are
intimately connected to interactions, and are thus not accessible in a mean

phase border, which are most pronounced in the low density regime. Second, the
investigation of the strong coupling limit reveals the existence of a new

excitations disperse only in the direction transverse to the characteristic
wave vector (1/2,0,0), whereas the electronic Fermi surface near (1/2,0,0)

occurs at an incommensurate wave vector compatible with nesting, neither
spin-wave nor Fermi-surface-nesting models can describe the magnetic

color relations), corresponding to radii of 2.63+-0.09 Rsun (3.4 percent

recent works, that these effects cannot be attributed to variations on the
energy of the EM vacuum but to variations of the dielectric self-energy. This
energy is the result of the interaction of the bare polarizability of the
dielectric constituents with the EM fluctuations of an actually polarized
vacuum. We have found an exact expression for the spectrum of these
fluctuations in a statistically homogeneous dielectric. Those fluctuations turn
out to be different to the ones of normal radiative modes. It is the latter
that carry the zero-point-energy (ZPE). Concerning spontaneous emission, we
clarify the nature of the radiation and the origin of the so-called local field
factors. Essential discrepancies are found with respect to previous works. We
perform a detailed analysis of the phenomenon of radiative and non-radiative
energy transfer. Analytical formulae are given for the decay rate of an

strong differential precession. We use a grid-based hydrodynamic code to
perform 3D simulations. This code has a relatively low numerical viscosity
compared with the SPH schemes that have been used previously to study inclined
discs. This allows the influence of viscosity on the disc evolution to be
tightly controlled. We find that for thick discs (h=0.05) with low alpha,
efficient warp communication in the discs allows them to precess as rigid
bodies with very little warping or twisting. Such discs are observed to align
with the binary orbit plane on the viscous evolution time. Thinner discs with
higher viscosity, in which warp communication is less efficient, develop
significant twists before achieving a state of rigid-body precession. Under the
most extreme conditions we consider (h=0.01, alpha=0.005 and alpha=0.1), we
find that discs can become broken or disrupted by strong differential
precession. Discs that become highly twisted are observed to align with the
binary orbit plane on timescales much shorter than the viscous timescale,
possibly on the precession time. We find agreement with previous studies that
show that thick discs with low viscosity experience mild warping and precess
rigidly. We also find that as h is decreased substantially, discs may be

outburst from 2005 to 2006. We followed the outburst with optical and
near-infrared photometry; the X-ray emission was further probed with
observations taken with XMM-Newton and Chandra during and after the outburst.
In addition, we obtained mid-infrared photometry and spectroscopy with Spitzer
at the peak of the outburst and in the post-outburst phase. The spectral energy
distribution of V1118 Ori varied significantly over the course of the outburst.
The optical flux showed the largest variations, most likely due to enhanced
emission by a hot spot. The latter dominated the optical and near-infrared
emission at the peak of the outburst, while the disk emission dominated in the
mid-infrared. The X-ray flux correlated with the optical and infrared fluxes,
indicating that accretion affected the magnetically active corona and the
stellar magnetosphere. The thermal structure of the corona was variable with
some indication of a cooling of the coronal temperature in the early phase of
the outburst with a gradual return to normal values. Color-color diagrams in
the optical and infrared showed variations during the outburst, with no obvious
signature of reddening due to circumstellar matter. Using MC realizations of
star+disk+hotspot models to fit the SED in ``quiescence'' and at the peak of
the outburst, we determined that the mass accretion rate varied from about
2.5E-7 Msun/yr to 1E-6 Msun/yr; in addition the fractional area of the hotspot
increased significantly as well. The multi-wavelength study of the V1118 Ori
outburst helped us to understand the variations in spectral energy
distributions and demonstrated the interplay between the disk and the stellar
magnetosphere in a young, strongly accreting star.

need to make their decisions in constant time. Since the original work by Korf
nearly two decades ago, numerous extensions have been suggested. One of the
most intriguing extensions is the idea of backtracking wherein the agent
decides to return to a previously visited state as opposed to moving forward
greedily. This idea has been empirically shown to have a significant impact on
various performance measures. The studies have been carried out in particular
empirical testbeds with specific real-time search algorithms that use
backtracking. Consequently, the extent to which the trends observed are
characteristic of backtracking in general is unclear. In this paper, we present
the first entirely theoretical study of backtracking in real-time heuristic
search. In particular, we present upper bounds on the solution cost exponential
and linear in a parameter regulating the amount of backtracking. The results
hold for a wide class of real-time heuristic search algorithms that includes
many existing algorithms as a small subclass.

nearby small stars have been surveyed intensively. Doppler studies and
microlensing have uncovered a population of planets with minimum masses of
1.9-10 times the Earth's mass (M_Earth), called super-Earths. The first
constraint on the bulk composition of this novel class of planets was afforded
by CoRoT-7b, but the distance and size of its star preclude atmospheric studies
in the foreseeable future. Here we report observations of the transiting planet
GJ 1214b, which has a mass of 6.55 M_Earth and a radius 2.68 times Earth's
radius (R_Earth), indicating that it is intermediate in stature between Earth
and the ice giants of the Solar System. We find that the planetary mass and
radius are consistent with a composition of primarily water enshrouded by a
hydrogen-helium envelope that is only 0.05% of the mass of the planet. The
atmosphere is probably escaping hydrodynamically, indicating that it has
undergone significant evolution during its history. As the star is small and

some states it is only the NG that predicts the spectrum well. This strongly
suggests that the ESTs can be re-summed. Nonetheless, there are a few states

rotation group) that exhibit large deviations from the NG predictions; these
deviations might provide clues to the nature of the effective string theory

from the protoplanetary nebula, sublimation of ices, and outgassing from rocky
material. Armed only with measurements of the planet mass (M_p=6.55+/-0.98

our main conclusion is that we cannot infer a unique composition. A diverse
range of planet interiors fits the measured planet properties. Nonetheless, GJ

it almost certainly has a significant gas component. Our second major
conclusion is that under most conditions we consider GJ 1214b would not have
liquid water. Even if the outer envelope is predominantly sublimated water ice,
the envelope will likely consist of a super-fluid layer sandwiched between
vapor above and plasma (electrically conductive fluid) below at greater depths.

correlation lengths, possibly reaching the size of superclusters, therefore
disfavouring the conventional picture of generation through primordial seeds
later amplified by galaxy-bound dynamo mechanisms. In this paper we put forward
a fundamentally different approach that links such large-scale magnetic fields
to the cosmological vacuum energy. In our scenario the dark energy is due to
the Veneziano ghost (which solves the $U(1)_A$ problem in QCD). The Veneziano
ghost couples through the triangle anomaly to the electromagnetic field with a
constant which is unambiguously fixed in the standard model. While this
interaction does not produce any physical effects in Minkowski space, it
triggers the generation of a magnetic field in an expanding universe at every
epoch. The induced energy of the magnetic field is thus proportional to
cosmological vacuum energy: $\rho_{EM}\simeq B^2 \simeq (\frac{\alpha}{4\pi})^2
\rho_{DE}$, $\rho_{DE}$ hence acting as a source for the magnetic energy
$\rho_{EM}$. The corresponding numerical estimate leads to a magnitude in the
nG range. There are two unique and distinctive predictions of our proposal: an
uninterrupted active generation of Hubble size correlated magnetic fields
throughout the evolution of the universe; the presence of parity violation on
the enormous scales $1/H$, which apparently has been already observed in CMB.
These predictions are entirely rooted into the standard model of particle
physics.

spatial extent of our survey allows us to search for extra-tidal features with
unprecedented sensitivity. The spatial distribution of candidate red giant
branch and horizontal branch stars is found to be non-uniform at the ~3 sigma
level. This substructure is aligned along the direction connecting the two
systems, indicative of a possible `bridge' of extra-tidal material. Fitting the
stellar distribution with a linear Gaussian model yields a significance of 4
sigma for this overdensity, a most likely FWHM of ~16 arcmin and a central
surface brightness of ~32 mag arcsec^{-2}. We investigate different scenarios
to explain the close proximity of Leo IV and Leo V and the possible tidal
bridge between them. Orbit calculations demonstrate that they are unlikely to
be remnants of a single disrupted progenitor, while a comparison with
cosmological simulations shows that a chance collision between unrelated
subhalos is negligibly small. Leo IV and Leo V could, however, be a bound
`tumbling pair' if their combined mass exceeds 8 +- 4 x 10^9 M_sun. The

independent streams of information, a subset of which are decoded by the
receiver, depending on the value of the collective interference. The main
contribution is to present an information-theoretic formulation of the problem
which allows us to characterize, with a guaranteed gap to optimality, the rates
that can be achieved by different data streams.
  Our results are articulated as follows. First, we exactly characterize the
capacity region of a two-user system assuming a binary-expansion deterministic
channel model. Second, we extend this result to a two-user additive white
Gaussian noise channel, providing an approximate characterization within
$\sqrt{3}/2$ bit of the actual capacity. Third, we focus on the symmetric
scenario in which users are active with the same probability and subject to the
same received power constraint, and study the maximum achievable expected
sum-rate, or throughput, for any number of users. In this case, for the
symmetric binary expansion deterministic channel (which is related to the
packet collision model used in the networking literature), we show that a
simple coding scheme which does not employ superposition coding achieves the
system throughput. This result also shows that the performance of slotted ALOHA
systems can be improved by allowing encoding rate adaptation at the
transmitters. For the symmetric additive white Gaussian noise channel, we
propose a scheme that is within one bit of the system throughput for any value

Gaussian process perspective a multioutput Mercer kernel is a covariance
function over correlated output functions. One way of constructing such kernels
is based on convolution processes (CP). A key problem for this approach is
efficient inference. Alvarez and Lawrence (2009) recently presented a sparse
approximation for CPs that enabled efficient inference. In this paper, we
extend this work in two directions: we introduce the concept of variational
inducing functions to handle potential non-smooth functions involved in the
kernel CP construction and we consider an alternative approach to approximate
inference based on variational methods, extending the work by Titsias (2009) to
the multiple output case. We demonstrate our approaches on prediction of school

quasi-normal and modified radiation phase is created within the quasi-normal

(hopping). The field is driven by simultaneous squeezing and polaron-dressing
of the collective boson level mode due to the additional boson mode. In a
finite lattice in the radiation domain there occurs a sequence of local
tunnelings (oscillations) between two minima of a local potential weakly
coupled to two assisting oscillations. The ""radiation"" phase reveals itself as
an almost ideal instanton--anti-instanton gas phase. The correlations among the
energy levels mediated by the additional mode in the mixed domain considerably
reduce the level repulsions. As a consequence, the Wigner level spacing
probability distribution of the two-boson Dicke model is non-universally
reduced from the Wigner to the semi-Poisson and asymptotically to the Poisson

intrusions is a topic of increasing practical relevance. One of the most
challenging scientific issues is the problem of finding effective patrolling
strategies that, at each time point, determine the next moves of the patrollers
in order to maximize some objective function. In the very last years this
problem has been addressed in a game theoretical fashion, explicitly
considering the presence of an adversarial intruder. The general idea is that
of modeling a patrolling situation as a game, played by the patrollers and the
intruder, and of studying the equilibria of this game to derive effective
patrolling strategies. In this paper we present a game theoretical formal
framework for the determination of effective patrolling strategies that extends
the previous proposals appeared in the literature, by considering environments
with arbitrary topology and arbitrary preferences for the agents. The main
original contributions of this paper are the formulation of the patrolling game
for generic graph environments, an algorithm for finding a deterministic
equilibrium strategy, which is a fixed path through the vertices of the graph,
and an algorithm for finding a non-deterministic equilibrium strategy, which is
a set of probabilities for moving between adjacent vertices of the graph. Both
the algorithms are analytically studied and experimentally validated, to assess
their properties and efficiency.

explained by a model in which the prompt emission consists of two components:
one is the MeV component due to the synchrotron-self-Compton radiation of
electrons accelerated in the internal shock of the jet and the other is the
high-energy component due to inverse Compton scattering of the photospheric
X-ray emission of the expanding cocoon off the same electrons in the jet. Such
an external inverse Compton effect could be important for other Fermi-LAT GRBs,

Residing at the high luminosity, high mass end of the blue sequence, LCBGs sit
at the critical juncture of galaxies that are evolving from the blue to the red
sequence. Yet we do not understand what drives the evolution of LCBGs, nor how
they will evolve. Based on single-dish HI observations, we know that they have
a diverse range of properties. LCBGs are HI-rich with M(HI)=10^{9-10.5} M(sun),
have moderate M(dyn)=10^{10-12} M(sun), and 80% have gas depletion timescales
less than 3 Gyr. These properties are consistent with LCBGs evolving into
low-mass spirals or high mass dwarf ellipticals or dwarf irregulars. However,
LCBGs do not follow the Tully-Fisher relation, nor can most evolve onto it,
implying that many LCBGs are not smoothly rotating, virialized systems. GMRT
and VLA HI maps confirm this conclusion revealing signatures of recent
interactions and dynamically hot components in some local LCBGs, consistent
with the formation of a thick disk or spheroid. Such signatures and the high
incidence of close companions around LCBGs suggest that star formation in local
LCBGs is likely triggered by interactions. The dynamical masses and apparent
spheroid formation in LCBGs combined with previous results from optical
spectroscopy are consistent with virial heating being the primary mechanism for
quenching star formation in these galaxies.

generates phase slips that destroy phase rigidity at large distances. Detailed
analytical and numerical studies of the corresponding Coulomb gas problem in a
random potential establish that the ground state, with a finite density of
vortices, is polarizable with a scale-dependent dielectric susceptibility.
Screening by vortex/antivortex pairs of arbitrarily large size is present to
eliminate the logarithmic divergence of the Coulomb energy of a single vortex.
The observed power-law decay of the Coulomb interaction between vortices with
distance in the ground state leads to a power-law divergence of the glass

measurements. We introduce quaternary diagrams to illustrate the range of
possible interior compositions for planets with four layers (iron core,
silicate mantles, water layers, and H/He envelopes). We apply our model to
CoRoT-7b, GJ 436b, and HAT-P-11b. Interpretation of planets with H/He envelopes
is limited by the model uncertainty in the interior temperature, while for
CoRoT-7b observational uncertainties dominate. We further find that our planet
interior model sharpens the observational constraints on CoRoT-7b's mass and
radius, assuming the planet does not contain significant amounts of water or
gas. We show that the strength of the limits that can be placed on a
super-Earth's composition depends on the planet's density; for similar
observational uncertainties, high-density super-Mercuries allow the tightest
composition constraints. Finally, we describe how techniques from Bayesian
statistics can be used to take into account in a formal way the combined
contributions of both theoretical and observational uncertainties to
ambiguities in a planet's interior composition. On the whole, with only a mass
and radius measurement an exact interior composition cannot be inferred for an

that atomic oxygen is being depleted from diffuse interstellar gas at a rate
that cannot be accounted for by its presence in silicate and metallic oxide
particles. To place this discovery in context, the uptake of elemental O into
dust is considered over a wide range of environments, from the tenuous
intercloud gas and diffuse clouds sampled by the depletion observations to
dense clouds where ice mantles and gaseous CO become important reservoirs of O.
The distribution of O in these contrasting regions is quantified in terms of a
common parameter, the mean number density of hydrogen. At the interface between
diffuse and dense phases (just before the onset of ice mantle growth) as much
as 160 ppm of the O abundance is unaccounted for. If this reservoir of depleted
oxygen persists to higher densities it has implications for the oxygen budget
in molecular clouds, where a shortfall of the same order is observed. Of
various potential carriers, the most plausible appears to be a form of
O-bearing carbonaceous matter similar to the organics found in cometary
particles returned by the Stardust mission. The ""organic refractory"" model for
interstellar dust is re-examined in the light of these findings, and it is
concluded that further observations and laboratory work are needed to determine
whether this class of material is present in quantities sufficient to account
for a significant fraction of the unidentified depleted oxygen.

three classical field theories that describe vortex decay in different levels

lifetimes than the alternative theories. Using the SPGPE theory to simulate
vortex decay for a trapped gas of $5\times 10^5$ $^{87}$Rb atoms, we calculate

that the published candidate progenitors are not coincident with their
respective supernova sites in pre-explosion Hubble Space Telescope
observations. We therefore derive upper luminosity and mass limits for the
unseen progenitors of both these supernovae, assuming they are red supergiants:
2006my (log L/Lsun = 4.51; mass < 13Msun) and 2006ov (log L/Lsun = 4.29; mass <
10Msun). In the case of supernova 2004et we show that the yellow-supergiant
progenitor candidate, originally identified in Canada France Hawaii Telescope
images, is still visible ~3 years post-explosion in observations from the
William Herschel Telescope. High-resolution Hubble Space Telescope and Gemini
(North) adaptive optics late-time imagery reveal that this source is not a
single yellow supergiant star, but rather is resolved into at least three
distinct sources. We report the discovery of the unresolved progenitor as an
excess of flux in pre-explosion Isaac Newton Telescope i'-band imaging.
Accounting for the late-time contribution of the supernova using published
optical spectra, we calculate the progenitor photometry as the difference
between the pre- and post-explosion, ground-based observations. We find the
progenitor was most likely a late K to late M-type supergiant of 8 +5/-1 Msun.
In all cases we conclude that future, high-resolution observations of the
supernova sites will be required to confirm these results.

purchase k edge-disjoint s-t paths, for given s and t. In the same setting, for
cut auctions, the auctioneer wants to purchase an s-t cut. Only the agents know
their costs, and the auctioneer needs to select a feasible set and payments
based on bids made by the agents.
  We present constant-competitive truthful mechanisms for all three set
systems. That is, the maximum overpayment of the mechanism is within a constant
factor of the maximum overpayment of any truthful mechanism, for every set

bid by a multiplier derived from the dominant eigenvector of a certain matrix.
The mechanism for k-flows prunes the graph to be minimally (k+1)-connected, and

scattering length. Based on this we show that for increasing scattering lengths
or equivalently increasing densities the system becomes less correlated and
that at large values of the scattering length Bragg scattering measures
directly the Fourier transform of the effective two-body potential. We
construct model potentials which fit the recently measured line shifts in

length units. The resolution in Bragg scattering experiments so far does not
reveal details of the frequency dependence in the dynamic structure function

ejections (CMEs) on the Sun is uncertain. One possible mechanism is the loss of
equilibrium of coronal magnetic flux ropes formed gradually by large-scale
surface motions. In this paper, the locations of flux rope ejections in a
recently-developed quasi-static global evolution model are compared with
observed CME source locations over a 4.5-month period in 1999. Using EUV data,
the low-coronal source locations are determined unambiguously for 98 out of 330
CMEs. Despite the incomplete observations, positive correlation (with
coefficient up to 0.49) is found between the distributions of observed and
simulated ejections, but only when binned into periods of one month or longer.
This binning timescale corresponds to the time interval at which magnetogram
data are assimilated into the coronal simulations, and the correlation arises
primarily from the large-scale surface magnetic field distribution; only a weak
dependence is found on the magnetic helicity imparted to the emerging active
regions. The simulations are limited in two main ways: they produce fewer
ejections, and they do not reproduce the strong clustering of observed CME
sources into active regions. Due to this clustering, the horizontal gradient of
radial photospheric magnetic field is better correlated with the observed CME
source distribution (coefficient 0.67). Our results suggest that, while the
gradual formation of magnetic flux ropes over weeks can account for many
observed CMEs, especially at higher latitudes, there exists a second class of
CMEs (at least half) for which dynamic active region flux emergence on shorter
timescales must be the dominant factor.

With these new data and literature measurements at sub-millimeter and
millimeter wavelengths, we analyze the dust properties of a sample of 21
isolated disks around T Tauri stars in the Taurus-Auriga star forming region.
Together with the information about the disks spatial extension from sub/mm-mm
interferometric studies, we derive from the observed sub-mm/mm spectral energy
distribution constraints on the dust opacity law at these wavelengths, using
two-layer flared disk models and a self-consistent dust model that takes
properly into account the variation of the dust opacity with grain growth. We
find evidence for the presence in the disk midplane of dust particles that have
grown to sizes as large as at least 1 millimeter in all the disks of our
sample, confirming what was previously observed on smaller brighter objects.
This indicates that the dust coagulation from ISM dust to mm-sized grains is a
very fast process in protoplanetary disks, that appears to occur before a young
stellar object enters the Class II evolutionary stage. Also, the amount of
these large grains in the disk outer regions is stationary throughout all the

parameters of the acoustic modes (large separation, range of excited pressure
modes, maximum amplitude, and its corresponding frequency), retrieve the
surface rotation period of the star and use these results to estimate the
global parameters of the star (radius and mass).To prepare the analysis of
hundreds of solar-like oscillating stars, we have developed a robust and
automatic pipeline. The pipeline consists of data analysis techniques, such as
Fast Fourier Transform, wavelets, autocorrelation, as well as the application
of minimisation algorithms for stellar-modelling. We apply our pipeline to some
simulated lightcurves from the asteroFLAG team and the Aarhus-asteroFLAG
simulator, and obtain results that are consistent with the input data to the
simulations. Our strategy gives correct results for stars with magnitudes below

then apply the pipeline to the Sun and three CoRoT targets.In particular we

retroreflector, are frequently used to enhance signal strength. The enhancement
effect is generally attributed to surface plasmons, however, the sub-wavelength
to near-wavelength dimensions of the pyramidal 3D geometry suggest
contributions from diffraction and near-field effects. Our theoretical analysis
of the light intensity distribution in the similar (but simpler) 2D geometry
assuming a perfect conductor screen, that is, in the absence of any plasmon
effects, shows that interference patterns forming within the cavity cause a
significant resonant increase in local intensity. Such effect can be important
for many applications, especially for the widely used Raman spectroscopy.
Resonant enhancement without plasmons of the emitted Raman signal due to
enhanced local field amplitude is also possible, which implies that the
geometry practically implements a Raman laser. Comparison of diffraction
patterns obtained with near-field and far-field approaches reveals that the
near-field component is responsible for the observed dramatic intensity
enhancement, and thus the Raman enhancement as well.

spectrum of T does not include three consecutive eigenvalues in arithmetic

non-thermal electrons (NTR) onto highly ionised heavy ions is not negligible
compared to non-thermal bremsstrahlung (NTB) as a source of flare hard X-rays
(HXRs) and so should be included in modelling non-thermal HXR flare emission.
In view of major discrepancies between BM results for the THERMAL continua and
those of the Chianti code and of RHESSI solar data, we critically re-examine
and correct the BM analysis and modify the conclusions concerning the
importance of NTR. Although the analytic Kramers expression used by BM is
correct for the purely hydrogenic recombination cross section, the heuristic
expressions used by BM to extend the Kramers expression beyond the `bare
nucleus' case to which it applies had serious errors. BM results have therefore
been recalculated using corrected expressions, which have been validated
against the results of detailed calculations. At T ~ 10-30 MK the dominant ions
are Fe 22+, 23+, 24+ for which BM erroneously overestimated NTR emission by
around an order of magnitude. Contrary to the BM claim, NTR in hot flare
plasmas does NOT dominate over NTB, although in some cases it can be comparable
and so still very important in inversions of photon spectra to derive electron
spectra, especially as NTR includes sharp edge features. The BM claim of
dominance of NTR over NTB in deka-keV emission is incorrect due to a serious
error in their analysis. However, the NTR contribution can still be large
enough to demand inclusion in spectral fitting, the spectral edges having
potentially serious effects on inversion of HXR spectra to infer fast electron
spectra.

$\pi_{q^r}(g_r)=\pi_{q^r}(F)$.
  We show that the Nagata automorphism (and any other automorphism in three

the one hand removes the hope of showing that such an automorphism is non-tame
by studying one bijection it induces, but on the other hand indicates that the
bijections of tame automorphisms coincide with bijections of all automorphisms.
  In section 5 we show that the whole tame group $\TA_n(\F_q)$ in turn can be

by affine maps and one particular element. It is known that if a field $k$ has

calculate corrections due to non-zero mass splitting. We discuss how the
possible non-unitarity of the lepton mixing matrix may modify these relations
and find in particular that corrections due to non-unitarity can exceed the
corrections due to mass splitting. We furthermore investigate constraints from
neutrino-less double beta decay on mass and mixing parameters of heavy

that heavy neutrinos are exchanged, and constraints from assuming light
neutrino exchange, which arise from an exact see-saw relation. The latter has
its origin in the unitarity violation arising in see-saw scenarios. We
illustrate that the limits from the latter approach are much stronger. The

the case for the second order formulation. In the second order formulation of
ADM gravity the need for such a redefinition is the result of the non-canonical
change of variables [arXiv: 0809.0097]. For the first order formulation, the
necessity of such a redefinition ""to correspond to diffeomorphism invariance""
(reported by Ghalati [arXiv: 0901.3344]) is just an artifact of using the
Henneaux-Teitelboim-Zanelli ansatz [Nucl. Phys. B 332 (1990) 169], which is
sensitive to the choice of linear combination of tertiary constraints. This
ansatz cannot be used as an algorithm for finding a gauge invariance, which is
a unique property of a physical system, and it should not be affected by
different choices of linear combinations of non-primary first class
constraints. The algorithm of Castellani [Ann. Phys. 143 (1982) 357] is free
from such a deficiency and it leads directly to four-diffeomorphism invariance
for first, as well as for second order Hamiltonian formulations of GR. The
distinct role of primary first class constraints, the effect of considering
different linear combinations of constraints, the canonical transformations of

to two other classes of set systems, namely, vertex cover systems and k-path

paths. For both settings, we bound the frugality of our mechanism in terms of
the largest eigenvalue of the respective interdependency matrix. We show that
our mechanism is optimal for a large subclass of vertex cover systems

mechanism is within a factor of k + 1 from optimal, we show that it is, in
fact, optimal, when one uses a modified definition of frugality proposed in
[Elkind et al.'07]. Our lower bound argument combines spectral techniques and
Young's inequality, and is applicable to all set systems. As both r-out-of-k

equations which together with some conditions on the coupling constants, imply
the second order equations of motion. The solutions belong to a sub-sector of

prove bounds on the probability that clusters are identified successfully, both

conclusions. First, k has to be chosen surprisingly high (rather of the order n

solid body rotation up to Reynolds numbers Re~1*10^5 and down to Rossby numbers
Ro~3*10^-3. The forcing function is a fully helical flow that can also be
viewed as mimicking the effect of atmospheric convective motions. We test in
the helical case variants of a model developed previously (Baerenzung et al.
2008a) against direct numerical simulations (DNS), using data from a run on a
grid of 15363 points; we also contrast its efficiency against a spectral Large
Eddy Simulation (LES) (Chollet and Lesieur 1981) as well as an under-resolved
DNS. The model including the contribution of helicity to the spectral eddy
dissipation and eddy noise behaves best, allowing to recover statistical
features of the flow. An exploration of parameter space is then performed
beyond what is feasible today using DNS. At fixed Reynolds number, lowering the
Rossby number leads to a regime of wave-mediated inertial helicity cascade to
small scales. However, at fixed Rossby number, increasing the Reynolds number
leads the system to be dominated by turbulent energy exchanges where the role
of inertial waves is to weaken the direct cascade of energy while strengthening
the large scales. We find that a useful parameter for partitioning the data is
NC = ReRo = U2rms/[nu Omega], with Urms, nu and Omega the rms velocity, the
viscosity and the rotation rate respectively. The parameter that determines how
much the energy cascade is direct or inverse in which case the cascade to small
scales is predominantly that of helicity is linked to Ro.

joint uplink/downlink achievable rate regions for multi-user spatial

consists of two models: the first one is a simple transmission model for uplink
and downlink, which is capable to give a lower bound on the capacity for the
case that the transmission is subject to imperfect CSI. A detailed model for
concrete channel estimation and feedback schemes provides parameter input to
the former model and covers the most important aspects such as pilot design
optimization, linear channel estimation, feedback delay, and feedback
quantization. We apply this framework to determine optimal pilot densities and
CSI feedback quantity, given that a weighted sum of uplink and downlink
throughput is to be maximized for a certain user velocity. We show that for low
speed, and if downlink throughput is of particular importance, a significant
portion of the uplink should be invested into CSI feedback. At higher velocity,
however, downlink performance becomes mainly affected by CSI feedback delay,
and hence CSI feedback brings little gain considering the inherent sacrifice of
uplink capacity. We further show that for high velocities, it becomes
beneficial to use no CSI feedback at all, but apply random beamforming in the
downlink and operate in time-division duplex.

that the real is what is immediately apprehended, that is the local or
observable, the physically tangible, though there has always been an
alternative philosophical notion that the 'real' is some kind of ontological
structure beyond immediate apprehension, and so inaccessible through physics.
However, quantum mechanics, with its intrinsic nonlocal correlations, has
seemingly left us with a dilemma by showing that fundamental physical theories
cannot be both real and local. Reality cannot be reconstructed as a
deterministic projection from physical observations. Many people think that the
problem lies with quantum mechanics, but, in fact, it is more likely to be a
result of unrealistic expectations. We have assumed that fundamental physics
ought to be compatible with normal (macroscopic) experience. If, however, we go
beyond our current high-level physical theories to the basic elements from
which they are constructed, we see that a pattern emerges that gives us a very
different and much more coherent understanding of what is meant by physical
'reality'.

character of quantum mechanics does not originate from uncertainties caused by
the process of measurement or observation, but rather reflects the presence of
objectively existing vacuum fluctuations whose action on massive particles is
calibrated by Planck's constant and effects an additional irregular motion. We
describe a one-particle system by introducing two equally large sub-ensembles
for each of which one obtains an equation of motion that has the form of a
Navier-Stokes- or ''anti''-Navier-Stokes-type equation, respectively. By
averaging over the total ensemble one obtains a new equation of motion which
can be converted into the time-dependent Schroedinger equation. The concept
allows the inclusion of electromagnetic fields and can be extended to
interacting N-particle systems. We analyze the problem of how an experimental
setup can consistently be decomposed into the quantum system under study and
the residual quantum system ''apparatus''. The irregular extra motion of the
particle under study allows a decomposition of the associated ensemble into two
sub-ensembles the members of which perform, respectively, a right-handed or
left-handed irregular circular motion about a given axis which becomes
physically relevant in the presence of a magnetic field. We demonstrate that
this orientation-decomposed ''Zitterbewegung'' behaves - in accordance with
Schroedinger's original idea - as a spin-type angular momentum which appears in
addition to a possible orbital angular moment of the particle. We derive the
non-relativistic time-dependent Pauli equation and propose a theory of the
Stern-Gerlach experiment. The Dirac equation can be derived similarly.
