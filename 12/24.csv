telecommunication networks with two hierarchy levels. In particular, we
consider two Cox processes concentrated on the edge set of a random
tessellation, where the points can describe the locations of low-level and
high-level network components, respectively, and the edge set the underlying
infrastructure of the network, like road systems, railways, etc. Furthermore,
each low-level component is marked with the shortest path along the edge set to
the nearest high-level component. We investigate the typical shortest path
length of the resulting marked point process, which is an important
characteristic e.g. in performance analysis and planning of telecommunication
networks. In particular, we show that its distribution converges to simple
parametric limit distributions if a certain scaling factor converges to zero
and infinity, respectively. This can be used to approximate the density of the
typical shortest path length by analytical formulae.

extend the main results of Etingof, Ginzburg and the first author (see [BEG])

simple rings, Morita equivalent to the Weyl algebra A_n(C), where n = dim X_k .
Our approach relies on representation theory of complex Cherednik algebras and
is parallel to that of [BEG]. As a by-product, we prove the existence of shift
operators for an arbitrary complex reflection group, confirming a conjecture of
Dunkl and Opdam. Another result is a proof of a conjecture of Opdam, concerning
certain operations (KZ twists) on the set of irreducible representations of W.

characterize the X-ray variability properties of 4U1543-47 in different
spectral states during the 2002 outburst. Second, we use surrogate data to
investigate whether the variability is nonlinear in any of the different
spectral states. The main findings can be summarized as follows. The mean
weighted scaling index appears to be able to parametrize uniquely the temporal
variability properties of this GBH: the 3 different spectral states of the 2002
outburst of 4U1543-47 are characterized by different and well constrained
values. The search for nonlinearity reveals that the variability is linear in
all light curves with the notable exception of the very high state. Our results
imply that we can use the WSIM to assign a single number, namely the mean
weighted scaling index, to a light curve, and in this way discriminate among
the different spectral states of a source. The detection of nonlinearity in the
VHS, that is characterized by the presence of most prominent QPOs, suggests
that intrinsically linear models which have been proposed to account for the
low frequency QPOs in GBHs may be ruled out (abridged).

loss. This leads to clumpy or filamentary inflow of gas on large scales (tens
of parsec), whereas a turbulent and very dense disc builds up on the parsec
scale. In order to capture the relevant physics in the inner region, we treat
this disc separately by viscously evolving the radial surface density
distribution. This enables us to link the tens of parsec scale region
(accessible via SINFONI observations) to the (sub-)parsec scale region
(observable with the MIDI instrument and via water maser emission). In this
work, we concentrate on the effects of a parametrised turbulent viscosity to
generate angular momentum and mass transfer in the disc and additionally take
star formation into account. Input parameters are constrained by observations
of the nearby Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068. At the current age of its nuclear
starburst of 250 Myr, our simulations yield disc sizes of the order of 0.8 to
0.9 pc, gas masses of 1.0e6 solar masses and mass transfer rates of 0.025 solar
masses per year through the inner rim of the disc. This shows that our large
scale torus model is able to approximately account for the disc size as
inferred from interferometric observations in the mid-infrared and compares
well to the extent and mass of a rotating disc structure as inferred from water
maser observations. Several other observational constraints are discussed as
well.

evolution acts as a significant energy production channel simply by reducing
the total gravitational binding energy and can significantly prolong the
initial core contraction phase before reaching the binary-burning quasi steady
state of the cluster evolution as noticed in Paper IV. We simulate a large grid
of clusters varying the initial cluster mass, binary fraction, and

the observed Galactic globular clusters (GGCs). We find that our simulated

(1993) and Genton and Ma (2000) are established for Gaussian processes, with
either short-range or long-range dependence. It is shown in the short-range
dependence setting that this robust estimator is asymptotically normal at the
rate $\sqrt{n}$, where $n$ is the number of observations. An explicit
expression of the asymptotic variance is also given and compared to the
asymptotic variance of the classical autocovariance estimator. In the
long-range dependence setting, the limiting distribution displays the same
behavior than that of the classical autocovariance estimator, with a Gaussian
limit and rate $\sqrt{n}$ when the Hurst parameter $H$ is less 3/4 and with a
non-Gaussian limit (belonging to the second Wiener chaos) with rate depending
on the Hurst parameter when $H \in (3/4,1)$. Some Monte-Carlo experiments are
presented to illustrate our claims and the Nile River data is analyzed as an
application. The theoretical results and the empirical evidence strongly
suggest using the robust estimators as an alternative to estimate the
dependence structure of Gaussian processes.

as the result of a Keck LGSAO imaging survey of young field brown dwarfs. Weak
K, Na, and FeH features as well as strong VO absorption in the integrated-light
J-band spectrum indicate a young age for the system. From spatially resolved
K-band spectra we determine spectral types of L3 and L5 for components A and B,
respectively. SDSS J2249+0044A is spectrally very similar to G196-3B, an L3
companion to a young M2.5 field dwarf. Thus, we adopt 100 Myr (the age estimate
of the G196-3 system) as the age of SDSS J2249+0044AB, but ages of 12-790 Myr
are possible. By comparison to G196-3B, we estimate a distance to SDSS
J2249+0044AB of 54 +- 16 pc and infer a projected separation of 17 +- 5 AU for
the binary. Comparison of the luminosities to evolutionary models at an age of
100 Myr yields masses of 0.029 and 0.022 Msun for SDSS J2249+0044A and B,
respectively. Over the possible ages of the system (12-790 Myr), the mass of
SDSS J2249+0044A could range from 0.011 to 0.070 Msun and the mass of SDSS
J2249+0044B could range from 0.009 to 0.065 Msun. Evolutionary models predict
that either component could be burning deuterium, which could result in a mass
ratio as low as 0.4, or alternatively, a reversal in the luminosities of the
binary. We find a likely proper motion companion, GSC 00568-01752, which lies
48.9"" away (2600 AU) and has SDSS+2MASS colors consistent with an early M
dwarf. The photometric distance to GSC 00568-01752 is 53 +- 15 pc, in agreement
with our distance estimate for SDSS J2249+0044AB. The space motion of SDSS
J2249+0044AB shows no obvious coincidence with known young moving groups. The
unusually red near-IR colors, young age, and low masses of the binary make it
an important template for studying planetary-mass objects found by direct
imaging surveys.

renormalization procedure relies on the characterization of the degeneracy
types in terms of the normal and tangential components of the magnetic field to
the wavefront in the fluid rest frame. Proper expressions of the renormalized
eigenvectors in conserved variables are obtained through the corresponding
matrix transformations. Our work completes previous analysis that present
different sets of right eigenvectors for non-degenerate and degenerate states,
and can be seen as a relativistic generalization of earlier work performed in
classical MHD. Based on the full wave decomposition (FWD) provided by the the
renormalized set of eigenvectors in conserved variables, we have also developed
a linearized (Roe-type) Riemann solver. Extensive testing against one- and
two-dimensional standard numerical problems allows us to conclude that our
solver is very robust. When compared with a family of simpler solvers that
avoid the knowledge of the full characteristic structure of the equations in
the computation of the numerical fluxes, our solver turns out to be less
diffusive than HLL and HLLC, and comparable in accuracy to the HLLD solver. The
amount of operations needed by the FWD solver makes it less efficient
computationally than those of the HLL family in one-dimensional problems.
However its relative efficiency increases in multidimensional simulations.

the NNN interaction causes the DPT boundary of the NN kinetic Ising model to
shift to larger values of magnetic field and temperature. The NNN kinetic Ising
model can therefore exhibit an interaction induced DPT. Also in the low
frequency limit (f$\to$0) the hysteresis loop area law, A(h$_{o}$,f), changes
from h$^{0.70}_{o}$f$^{0.36}$ (NN) to h$^{0.14\pm 0.01}_{o}$f$^{0.13\pm0.01}$
(NNN) where h$_o$ is the external field amplitude and f is the frequency. DPT
and hysteresis in the kinetic Ising model arises as a competition between the
system's metastable lifetime and the time period of the external field.
Including the NNN interaction changes the system's metastable lifetime. This
causes the DPT and the hysteretic properties to change. We conclude that the
systems metastable lifetime is sensitive not only to the lattice size, external
field amplitude, and temperature but also to additional interactions present in
the system. Furthermore by tracking the probability density P(Q) of the dynamic
order parameter Q we conclude that the DPT is of second order.

thus find that the order(\alpha'^3) corrections affect the vector correlators
only indirectly, through the corrected metric. We apply our results to
investigate scattering off a supersymmetric Yang-Mills plasma at low and high

larger as the carbon nanoring size is increased, in contradiction with typical
quantum confinement effects. In order to understand their unusual electronic
properties, I performed an extensive investigation of excitonic effects by
analyzing electron-hole transition density matrices and exciton binding
energies as a function of size in these nanoring systems. The transition
density matrices allow a global view of electronic coherence during an
electronic excitation, and the exciton binding energies give a quantitative
measure of electron-hole interaction energies in the nanorings. Based on
overall trends in exciton binding energies and their spatial delocalization, I

in response to many kinds of stress. Two views on the evolutionary origin of
this phenomenon emerged: the pleiotropic hypothesis positing that it is a
byproduct of environmental stress or other specific stress response mechanisms
and the second order selection which states that mutators hitchhike to fixation
with unrelated beneficial alleles. Conventional population genetics models
could not fully resolve this controversy because they are based on certain
assumptions about fitness landscape. Here we address this problem using a
microscopic multiscale model, which couples physically realistic molecular
descriptions of proteins and their interactions with population genetics of
carrier organisms without assuming any a priori fitness landscape. We found
that both pleiotropy and second order selection play a crucial role at
different stages of adaptation: the supply of mutators is provided through
destabilization of error correction complexes or fluctuations of production
levels of prototypic mismatch repair proteins (pleiotropic effects), while rise
and fixation of mutators occur when there is a sufficient supply of beneficial
mutations in replication-controlling genes. This general mechanism assures a
robust and reliable adaptation of organisms to unforeseen challenges. This
study highlights physical principles underlying physical biological mechanisms
of stress response and adaptation.

is eliminated as free argument, since now its value is obtained from the
cluster physical properties (mass, age and metallicity) and from the gaseous
medium characteristics (density and abundances). We discuss our results and
compare them with those from previous models and also with a large and data set

homogeneous manner. The values of the [OIII] lines (at $\lambda\lambda$ 4363,

similar to those coming from very high metallicity regions (solar or

distinguish between very low and very high metallicity regions. In these cases
we emphasize the need of the additional support of alternative metallicity

the Sculptor dwarf galaxy based on a medium-resolution spectrum cast some doubt
on this conclusion. However, verification of the iron-deficiency and
measurements of additional elements, such as the alpha-element Mg, are
mandatory for demonstrating that the same type of stars produced the metals
found in dwarf galaxies and the Galactic halo. Only then can dwarf galaxy stars
be conclusively linked to early stellar halo assembly. Here we report
high-resolution spectroscopic abundances for 11 elements in S1020549,
confirming the iron abundance of less than 1/4000th that of the Sun, and
showing that the overall abundance pattern mirrors that seen in low-metallicity
halo stars, including the alpha-elements. Such chemical similarity indicates
that the systems destroyed to form the halo billions of years ago were not

introduction of a Lagrange Bose field enables treating them as bosons or
fermions. The energy spectrum of this field accounts for the tendency of
hole-doped cuprates to form stripe-like inhomogeneities. Consequently, it
induces a different analytical behavior for auxiliary particles corresponding
to ""antinodal"" and ""nodal"" electrons, enabling the existence of different

observed phase diagram of the cuprates, including the non-Fermi-liquid to FL

of operationally understood circuits is laid out. Circuits are comprised of
operations and wires. An operation is one use of an apparatus and a wire is a
diagrammatic device for showing how apertures on the apparatuses are placed
next to each other. Mathematical objects are defined in terms of the circuit
understood graphically. In particular, we do not think of the circuit as
sitting in a background time. Circuits can be foliated by hypersurfaces
comprised of sets of wires. Systems are defined to be associated with wires. A
closable set of operations is defined to be one for which the probability
associated with any circuit built from this set is independent both of choices
on other circuits and of extra circuitry that may be added to outputs from this
circuit. States can be associated with circuit fragments corresponding to
preparations. These states evolve on passing through circuit fragments
corresponding to transformations. The composition of transformations is
treated. A number of theorems are proven including one which rules out
quaternionic quantum theory. The case of locally tomographic theories (where
local measurements on a systems components suffice to determine the global
state) is considered. For such theories the probability can be calculated for a
circuit from matrices pertaining the operations that comprise that circuit.
Classical probability theory and quantum theory are exhibited as examples in
this framework.

adopt the 100--200 cells per clump radius resolution. In this paper we present
the results of a convergence study for radiatively cooling clumps undertaken
over a broad range of resolutions, from 12 to 1,536 cells per clump radius,
employing adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) in a 2D axisymmetric geometry
(""2.5D""). We also provide a fully 3D simulation, at 192 cells per clump radius,
which supports our 2.5D results. We find no appreciable self-convergence at
~100 cells per clump radius as small-scale differences owing to increasingly
resolving the ""cooling length"" have global effects. We therefore conclude that
self-convergence is an insufficient criterion to apply on its own when
addressing the question of sufficient resolution for radiatively cooled shocked
clump simulations. We suggest the adoption of alternate criteria to support a
statement of sufficient resolution, such as the demonstration of adequate
resolution of the cooling layers behind shocks. We discuss an associated
refinement criteria for AMR codes.

several theoretical/experimental studies. Formation of loops and their opening
are key processes in many important biological processes. Loop formation in
flexible chains has been extensively studied by many groups. However, in the
more realistic case of semiflexible polymers, not much results are available.
In a recent study (K. P. Santo and K. L. Sebastian, Phys. Rev. E, \textbf{73},
031293 (2006)), we investigated opening dynamics of semiflexible loops in the
short chain limit and presented results for opening rates as a function of the
length of the chain. We presented an approximate model for a semiflexible
polymer in the rod limit, based on a semiclassical expansion of the bending
energy of the chain. The model provided an easy way to describe the dynamics.
In this paper, using this model, we investigate the reverse process, i.e., the
loop formation dynamics of a semiflexible polymer chain by describing the
process as a diffusion-controlled reaction. We perform a detailed
multidimensional analysis of the problem and calculate closing times for a
semiflexible chain which leads to results that are physically expected. Such a
multidimensional analysis leading to these results does not seem to exist in
the literature so far.

of multifractal analysis, we show that there is a marked finite-size effect in
the detection of multifractality, and the effective multifractality is the
apparent multifractality after removing the finite-size effect. We find that
the effective multifractality can be further decomposed into two components,
the PDF component and the nonlinearity component. Referring to the normal
distribution, we can determine the PDF component by comparing the effective
multifractality of the original time series and the surrogate data that have a
normal distribution and keep the same linear and nonlinear correlations as the
original data. We demonstrate our method by taking the daily volatility data of
Dow Jones Industrial Average from 26 May 1896 to 27 April 2007 as an example.
Extensive numerical experiments show that a time series exhibits effective
multifractality only if it possesses nonlinearity and the PDF has impact on the
effective multifractality only when the time series possesses nonlinearity. Our
method can also be applied to judge the presence of multifractality and
determine its components of multifractal time series in other complex systems.

v-band data were calibrated to radiance using in-flight stellar observations.
The other band data were calibrated to reflectance by comparing them to
ground-based observations to avoid the uncertainty of the solar irradiation in
those bands. We found that the AMICA signal was linear with respect to the
input signal to an accuracy of << 1% when the signal level was < 3800 DN. We
verified that the absolute radiance calibration of the AMICA v-band (0.55
micron) was accurate to 4% or less, the accuracy of the disk-integrated spectra
with respect to the AMICA v-band was about 1%, and the pixel-to-pixel
responsivity (flatfield) variation was 3% or less. The uncertainty in

we found that the AMICA optics have an effective focal length of 120.80 \pm

geometric distortion model was accurate to within a third of a pixel. We
demonstrated an image-restoration technique using the point-spread functions of

problem of long-term water resource allocation on a multi-connection reservoir
network which, in two aspects, is different to the problem considered in
previous works. First, while all previous works consider a problem where each
reservoir can transfer water to only one fixed reservoir, we consider a
multi-connection network being constructed in Thailand in which each reservoir
can transfer water to many reservoirs in one period of time. Second, a
demand-supply plan considered here is static, in contrast to a dynamic policy
considered in previous works. Moreover, in order to efficiently develop a
long-term static plan, a severe loss (a risk) is taken into account, i.e. a
risk occurs if the real amount of water stored in each reservoir in each time
period is less than what planned by the optimizer. The multi-connection
function and the risk make the problem rather complex such that traditional
stochastic dynamic programming and deterministic/heuristic approaches are
inappropriate. Our framework is based on a novel convex programming formulation
in which stochastic information can be naturally taken into account and an
optimal solution is guaranteed to be found efficiently. Extensive experimental
results show promising results of the framework.

afterglow lightcurve. We make an extensive search for such a feature. Twenty
optically selected GRBs and 12 X-ray selected GRBs are found, among which 17
optically selected GRBs and 2 X-ray-selected GRBs have redshift measurements.
We fit the lightcurves with a smooth broken power-law and measure the temporal
characteristic timescales of the bumps at FWHM. Strong mutual correlations
among these timescales are found, and a dimmer and broader bump tends to peak
at a later peak time. The ratio of rising to decaying timescales is almost
universal among bursts, but the ratio of the rising time to the peak time
varies from 0.3~1. The E_iso is tightly correlated with the peak luminosity and
the peak time of the bump in the burst frame. Assuming that the bumps signal
the deceleration of the GRB fireballs in a constant density medium, we
calculate the initial Lorentz factor (Gamma_0) and the deceleration radius
(R_dec) of the GRBs in the optical-selected sample. It is found that Gamma_0
are typically a few hundreds, and the typical deceleration radius is
R_dec~10^{17} cm. More intriguingly, a tight correlation between the Gamma_0
and E_iso is found, namely Gamma_0 ~ 195 E_iso, 52}^{0.27} (satisfied for both
the optical and X-ray z-known samples). It is helpful to understand GRB
physics, and may serve as an indicator of Gamma_0. We find that the early
bright X-rays are usually dominated by a different component from the external
shock emission, but occasionally (for one case) an achromatic deceleration
feature is observed. Components in X-rays would contribute to the diversity of
the observed X-ray lightcurves (abridge).

motion with including the battery-contact effect. The frequency is given as a
sum of a contribution from an Aharonov-Bohm phase that arises when
charged-partices pass through an electric field in the insulator and that from
a chemical potential difference arising form the battery contact; each of them
contributes $|q|V/h$ to the frequency where $q$ is the charge, thus, the sum is
$2|q|V/h$. The observed Josepshon frequency, $2|e|V/h$, hence, means that the
charge on the tunneling particles is $e$. A variety of derivations so far miss
one of the above two contributions; the original derivation misses the first
contribution due to the lack of inclusion of the electric field in the
insulator. The present result indicates that the phase of the order-parameter
does not arise from the number fluctuations of Cooper pairs. We present an
alternative origin for it; we argue that a Berry phase that arises from
spin-vortices is the origin.

counterflow in superfluid $^4$He by using the vortex filament model with the
full Biot--Savart law. The pioneering work of Schwarz has two shortcomings: it
neglects the non-local terms of the Biot--Savart integral (known as the
localized induction approximation, LIA) and it employs an unphysical mixing
procedure to sustain the statistically steady state of turbulence. For the
first time we have succeeded in generating the statistically steady state under
periodic boundary conditions without using the LIA or the mixing procedure.
This state exhibits the characteristic relation $L=\gamma^2 v_{ns}^2$ between
the line-length density $L$ and the counterflow relative velocity $v_{ns}$ and
there is quantitative agreement between the coefficient $\gamma$ and some
measured values. The parameter $\gamma$ and some anisotropy parameters are
calculated as functions of temperature and the counterflow relative velocity.
The numerical results obtained using the full Biot--Savart law are compared
with those obtained using the LIA. The LIA calculation constructs a layered
structure of vortices and does not proceed to a turbulent state but rather to
another anisotropic vortex state; thus, the LIA is not suitable for simulations
of turbulence.

for \theta-(BEDT-TTF)2RbZn(SCN)4 than for \alpha-(BEDT-TTF)2I3, which is a
consequence of the larger stabilization energy in \theta-(BEDT-TTF)2RbZn(SCN)4.
After local photoexcitation in the charge ordered states, the growth of a
photoinduced domain shows anisotropy. In \theta-(BEDT-TTF)2RbZn(SCN)4, the
domain hardly expands to the direction perpendicular to the horizontal-stripes.
This is because all the molecules on the hole-rich stripe are rotated in one
direction and those on the hole-poor stripe in the other direction. They
modulate horizontally connected transfer integrals homogeneously, stabilizing
the charge order stripe by stripe. In \alpha-(BEDT-TTF)2I3, lattice distortions
locally stabilize the charge order so that it is easily weakened by local
photoexcitation. The photoinduced domain indeed expands in the plane. These
results are consistent with recent observation by femtosecond reflection
spectroscopy.

dynamical configuration in the Solar System, because of high-amplitude
horseshoe orbits, due to a mass ratio of order unity. As a consequence, they
swap their orbits every 4 years, while their orbital periods is about 0.695
days. Recently, Tiscareno et al.(2009) got observational informations on the
shapes and the rotational states of these satellites. In particular, they
detected an offset in the expected equilibrium position of Janus, and a large
libration of Epimetheus. We here propose to give a 3-dimensional theory of the
rotation of these satellites in using these observed data, and to compare it to
the observed rotations. We consider the two satellites as triaxial rigid
bodies, and we perform numerical integrations of the system in assuming the
free librations as damped. The periods of the three free librations we get,
associated with the 3 dimensions, are respectively 1.267, 2.179 and 2.098 days
for Janus, and 0.747, 1.804 and 5.542 days for Epimetheus. The proximity of
0.747 days to the orbital period causes a high sensitivity of the librations of
Epimetheus to the moments of inertia. Our theory explains the amplitude of the
librations of Janus and the error bars of the librations of Epimetheus, but not
an observed offset in the orientation of Janus.

These experiments probe the visibility of Aharonov-Bohm (AB) oscillations in
differential conductance as an interferometer is driven out of equilibrium by
an applied bias, finding a lobe pattern in visibility as a function of voltage.
We calculate the dependence on voltage of the visibility and the phase of AB
oscillations at zero temperature, taking into account long range interactions
between electrons in the same edge for interferometers operating at a filling
fraction $\nu=1$. We obtain an exact solution via bosonization for models in
which electrons interact only when they are inside the interferometer. This
solution is non-perturbative in the tunneling probabilities at quantum point
contacts. The results match observations in considerable detail provided the
transparency of the incoming contact is close to one-half: the variation in
visibility with bias voltage consists of a series of lobes of decreasing
amplitude, and the phase of the AB-fringes is practically constant inside the
lobes but jumps by $\pi$ at the minima of the visibility. We discuss in
addition the consequences of approximations made in other recent treatments of
this problem. We also formulate perturbation theory in the interaction strength
and use this to study the importance of interactions that are not internal to

efficiently using wavelets. To demonstrate, we first generate a mock supernovae
(SNe) data sample for a SNAP-like survey with a bump feature in w(z) hidden in,
then successfully discover it by performing a blind wavelet analysis. We also
apply our method to analyze the recently released ""Constitution"" SNe data,
combined with WMAP and BAO from SDSS, and find weak hints of dark energy
dynamics. Namely, we find that models with w(z) < -1 for 0.2 < z < 0.5, and
w(z)> -1 for 0.5 < z <1, are mildly favored at 95% confidence level. This is in
good agreement with several recent studies using other methods, such as
redshift binning with principal component analysis (PCA) (e.g. Zhao and Zhang,

systematically investigate the situation for different classes of initial spin

of HST calibrators within the instability strip. A recalibration of the
period-luminosity relation is obtained using Galactic Cepheids in open clusters
and groups, the resulting relationship, described by log L/L_sun =
2.415(+-0.035) + 1.148(+-0.044)log P, exhibiting only the moderate scatter
expected from color spread within the instability strip. The relationship is
confirmed by Cepheids with HST parallaxes, although without the need for
Lutz-Kelker corrections, and in general by Cepheids with revised Hipparcos
parallaxes, albeit with concerns about the cited precisions of the latter. A

depends on the Planck constant \hbar and reduces to the dispersionless KP
hierarchy as \hbar -> 0. A recursive construction of its solutions on the basis
of a Riemann-Hilbert problem for the pair (L,M) of Lax and Orlov-Schulman

recursion relations for the coefficients X_n of an \hbar-expansion of the

W is expressed in the exponential form W = \exp(X/\hbar). Given the lowest
order term X_0, one can solve the recursion relations to obtain the higher
order terms. The wave function \Psi associated with W turns out to have the WKB
form \Psi = \exp(S/\hbar), and the coefficients S_n of the \hbar-expansion S =

data compression, and statistics with causality constraints. In particular, we
show that directed information is an upper bound on the increment in growth
rates of optimal portfolios in a stock market due to {causal} side information.
This upper bound is tight for gambling in a horse race, which is an extreme
case of stock markets. Directed information also characterizes the value of
{causal} side information in instantaneous compression and quantifies the
benefit of {causal} inference in joint compression of two stochastic processes.
In hypothesis testing, directed information evaluates the best error exponent
for testing whether a random process $Y$ {causally} influences another process
$X$ or not. These results give a natural interpretation of directed information
$I(Y^n \to X^n)$ as the amount of information that a random sequence $Y^n =
(Y_1,Y_2,..., Y_n)$ {causally} provides about another random sequence $X^n =
(X_1,X_2,...,X_n)$. A new measure, {\em directed lautum information}, is also
introduced and interpreted in portfolio theory, data compression, and
hypothesis testing.

The measure $\mu$ belongs to an arbitrary but known class $C$ of stochastic
process measures. We are interested in predictors $\rho$ whose conditional
probabilities converge (in some sense) to the ""true"" $\mu$-conditional
probabilities if any $\mu\in C$ is chosen to generate the sequence. The
contribution of this work is in characterizing the families $C$ for which such
predictors exist, and in providing a specific and simple form in which to look
for a solution. We show that if any predictor works, then there exists a
Bayesian predictor, whose prior is discrete, and which works too. We also find
several sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence of a predictor,
in terms of topological characterizations of the family $C$, as well as in
terms of local behaviour of the measures in $C$, which in some cases lead to
procedures for constructing such predictors. It should be emphasized that the
framework is completely general: the stochastic processes considered are not
