shocks show evidence of strong magnetic field amplification (a factor of ~100
between the upstream and downstream medium). This amplification may be due to
plasma instabilities driven by shock-accelerated cosmic rays (CRs). One
candidate is the cosmic ray current-driven (CRCD) instability (Bell 2004),
caused by the electric current of large Larmor radii CRs propagating parallel
to the upstream magnetic field. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations have shown
that the back-reaction of the amplified field on CRs would limit the
amplification factor of this instability to less than ~10 in galactic SNRs. In
this paper, we study the possibility of further amplification driven near
shocks by ""magnetized"" CRs, whose Larmor radii are smaller than the length
scale of the field that was previously amplified by the CRCD instability. We
find that additional amplification can occur due to a new instability, driven
by the CR current perpendicular to the field, which we term the ""perpendicular
current-driven instability"" (PCDI). We derive the growth rate of this
instability, and, using PIC simulations, study its non-linear evolution and
saturation. We find that PCDI increases the amplification of the field
(amplification factor up to ~45, not including the shock compression) and
discuss its observational signatures. Our results strengthen the idea of CRs
driving a significant part of the magnetic field amplification observed in SNR
shocks.

interference in losses from the condensate, as well as a dispersive-like shift
of resonance. A simple analytical model, based on the limit of weakly bound
molecules, agrees well with numerical experiments that explicitly include
dissociation to noncondensate modes. For a resonant laser and an off-resonant
magnetic field, constructive interference enables saturation of the
photoassociation rate at user-friendly intensities, at a value set by the
interparticle distance. This rate limit is larger for smaller condensate
densities and, near the Feshbach resonance, approaches the rate limit for
magnetoassociation alone. Also, we find agreement with the unitary limit--set
by the condensate size--only for a limited range of near-resonant magnetic
fields. Finally, for a resonant magnetic field and an off-resonant laser,
magnetoassociation displays similar quantum interference and a dispersive-like
shift. Unlike photoassociation, interference and the fieldshift in resonant
magnetoassociation is tunable with both laser intensity and detuning. Also, the
dispersive-like shift of the Feshbach resonance depends on the size of the
Feshbach molecule, and is a signature of non-universal physics in a strongly
interacting system.

Nanoscale topological insulator materials have a large surface-to-volume ratio
that can manifest the conductive surface states and are promising candidates
for devices. Here we report the synthesis and characterization of high quality
single crystalline Bi2Se3 nanomaterials with a variety of morphologies. The
synthesis of Bi2Se3 nanowires and nanoribbons employs Au-catalyzed
vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism. Nanowires, which exhibit rough surfaces,
are formed by stacking nanoplatelets along the axial direction of the wires.
Nanoribbons are grown along [11-20] direction with a rectangular cross-section
and have diverse morphologies, including quasi-one-dimensional, sheetlike,
zigzag and sawtooth shapes. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) studies on
nanoribbons show atomically smooth surfaces with ~ 1 nm step edges, indicating
single Se-Bi-Se-Bi-Se quintuple layers. STM measurements reveal a honeycomb
atomic lattice, suggesting that the STM tip couples not only to the top Se
atomic layer, but also to the Bi atomic layer underneath, which opens up the
possibility to investigate the contribution of different atomic orbitals to the
topological surface states. Transport measurements of a single nanoribbon
device (four terminal resistance and Hall resistance) show great promise for
nanoribbons as candidates to study topological surface states.

cosmological model based on a non-linear modification of General Relativity in
which the standard Einstein-Hilbert action is replaced by one of
Dirac-Born-Infeld type. It is shown that the dynamics of this model is
extremely rich: there are found equilibrium points in the phase space that can
be associated with matter-dominated, matter-curvature scaling, de Sitter, and
even phantom-like solutions. Depending on the value of the overall parameters
the dynamics in phase space can show multi-attractor structure into the future
(multiple future attractors may co-exist). This is a consequence of
bifurcations in control parameter space, showing strong dependence of the
model's dynamical properties on the free parameters. Contrary to what is
expected from non-linear modifications of general relativity of this kind,
removal of the initial spacetime singularity is not a generic feature of the
corresponding cosmological model. Instead, the starting point of the cosmic
dynamics -- the past attractor in the phase space -- is a state of infinitely
large value of the Hubble rate squared, usually associated with the big bang
singularity.

(ii) if there is a parity violating component it is large and, surprisingly, of
the same magnitude as the background, and (iii) the observed dependence of the
signal on the transverse momentum (p_t) is consistent with a soft boost in p_t
and thus in line with expectations from the proposed chiral magnetic effect.

detected at 90um. Starting from this catalog, we selected galaxies by matching
AKARI sources with those in the IRAS PSCz. Next, we have measured total GALEX
FUV and NUV flux densities. Then, we have matched this sample with SDSS and
2MASS galaxies. By this procedure, we obtained the final sample which consists
of 607 galaxies. If we sort the sample with respect to 90um, their average SED
shows a coherent trend: the more luminous at 90um, the redder the global SED
becomes. The M_r--NUV-r color-magnitude relation of our sample does not show
bimodality, and the distribution is centered on the green valley between the
blue cloud and red sequence seen in optical surveys. We have established
formulae to convert FIR luminosity from AKARI bands to the total infrared (IR)
luminosity L_TIR. With these formulae, we calculated the star formation
directly visible with FUV and hidden by dust. The luminosity related to star
formation activity (L_SF) is dominated by L_TIR even if we take into account
the far-infrared (FIR) emission from dust heated by old stars. At high star
formation rate (SFR) (> 20 Msun yr^-1), the fraction of directly visible SFR,
SFR_FUV, decreases. We also estimated the FUV attenuation A_FUV from
FUV-to-total IR (TIR) luminosity ratio. We also examined the L_TIR/L_FUV-UV
slope (FUV- NUV) relation. The majority of the sample has L_TIR/L_FUV ratios 5
to 10 times lower than expected from the local starburst relation, while some
LIRGs and all the ULIRGs of this sample have higher L_TIR/L_FUV ratios. We
found that the attenuation indicator L_TIR/L_FUV is correlated to the stellar
mass of galaxies, M*, but there is no correlation with specific SFR (SSFR),
SFR/M*, and dust attenuation L_TIR/L_FUV. (abridged)

Optimized performance shows great improvement in total bandwidth consumption

role of spin in gravitation dated before the firm establishment of the electron
spin in 1925. Since mass and spin or helicity in the case of zero mass are the
only invariants of the Poincare group and mass participates in universal
gravitation, these searches are natural steps to pursue. Here we review both
the theoretical and experimental efforts in searching for the role of
spin/polarization in gravitation. We discuss torsion, Poincare gauge theories,
teleparallel theories, metric-affine connection theories and pseudoscalar
(axion) theories. We discuss laboratory searches for electron and nucleus
spin-couplings -- the weak equivalence principle experiments for
polarized-bodies, the finite-range spin-coupling experiments, the spin-spin
coupling experiments and the cosmic-spin coupling experiments. The role played
by angular momentum and rotation is explicitly discussed. We discuss
astrophysical and cosmological searches for photon polarization coupling.
Investigation in the implications and interrelations of equivalence principles
led to a possible pseudoscalar or vector interaction, and led to the proposal
of WEP II (Weak Equivalence Principle II) which include rotation in the
universal free-fall motion. Evidences for WEP II are discussed and compiled.

emission variability on parsec scales around a compact unresolved radio core.
For the last three decades it has been closely monitored with very long
baseline interferometry (VLBI), yielding a wealth of information about the
physics of relativistic outflows and dynamics of the central regions in AGN. We
present here preliminary results for the long-term jet evolution, based on the
15 GHz monitoring data collected by the MOJAVE survey and various other groups
over the last ~14 years and combined with data from earlier VLBI observations
of 3C 345 which started in 1979. We discuss the trajectories, kinematics, and
flux density evolution of enhanced emission regions embedded in the jet and
present evidence for geometrical (e.g. precession) and physical (e.g.
relativistic shocks and plasma instability) factors determining the morphology
and dynamics of relativistic flows on parsec scales.

introducing a well-defined proper time from the kappa-deformed Minkowski
spacetime related to the standard basis. The extended Minkowski spacetime is
commutative, i.e. it is based on the standard Heisenberg commutation relations,
but some information of noncommutativity is encoded through the proper time to
it. Within this framework, by simply considering the Lorentz invariance we can
construct field theory models that comprise noncommutative effects naturally.
In particular, we find a kind of temporal fuzziness related to noncommutativity
in the noncommutative extension of the Minkowski spacetime. As a primary
application, we investigate three types of formulations of chiral bosons,
deduce the lagrangian theories of noncommutative chiral bosons and quantize
them consistently in accordance with Dirac's method, and further analyze the
self-duality of the lagrangian theories in terms of the parent action approach.

governed by the space-charge-limited flow of current at low biases while the FN
model fits the I-V curves in high voltage regime. We also examined
electrostatic gating effect of the vacuum electronic device. Graphene nanogap

(cLBV) via detection of an infrared circular nebula and follow-up spectroscopy
of its central star. The nebula, MN112, is one of many dozens of circular
nebulae detected at $24 \mu$m in the {\it Spitzer Space Telescope} archival
data, whose morphology is similar to that of nebulae associated with known
(c)LBVs and related evolved massive stars. Specifically, the core-halo
morphology of MN112 bears a striking resemblance to the circumstellar nebula
associated with the Galactic cLBV GAL 079.29+00.46, which suggests that both
nebulae might have a similar origin and that the central star of MN112 is a
LBV. The spectroscopy of the central star showed that its spectrum is almost
identical to that of the bona fide LBV P Cygni, which also supports the LBV
classification of the object. To further constrain the nature of MN112, we
searched for signatures of possible high-amplitude ($\ga 1$ mag) photometric
variability of the central star using archival and newly obtained photometric
data covering a 45 year period. We found that the B magnitude of the star was
constant ($\simeq$ 17.1$\pm$0.3 mag) over this period, while in the I band the
star brightened by $\simeq 0.4$ mag during the last 17 years. Although the
non-detection of large photometric variability leads us to use the prefix
`candidate' in the classification of MN112, we remind that the long-term
photometric stability is not unusual for genuine LBVs and that the brightness
of P Cygni remains relatively stable during the last three centuries.

model the interplay between electron correlations and the fine electron
structure due to the magnetic field is essentially emerged. Without electron
correlations the magnetic field induces the electron structure to the so-called
Hofstadter butterfly. It is found that when electron correlations drives the
metal-insulator transition, they simultaneously smear out the fine structure of
the Hofstadter butterfly. In a long-range ordered phase, the electron
correlation induced gap preserves the fine structure, but it separates the
Hofstadter butterfly into two wings.
