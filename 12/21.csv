crucial step is to determine the number of support points needed. Current tools
handle this on a case-by-case basis. Each combination of model, optimality
criterion and objective requires its own proof. The celebrated de la Garza
Phenomenon states that under a (p-1)th-degree polynomial regression model, any
optimal design can be based on at most p design points, the minimum number of
support points such that all parameters are estimable. Does this conclusion
also hold for nonlinear models? If the answer is yes, it would be relatively
easy to derive any optimal design, analytically or numerically. In this paper,
a novel approach is developed to address this question. Using this new
approach, it can be easily shown that the de la Garza phenomenon exists for
many commonly studied nonlinear models, such as the Emax model, exponential
model, three- and four-parameter log-linear models, Emax-PK1 model, as well as
many classical polynomial regression models. The proposed approach unifies and
extends many well-known results in the optimal design literature. It has four
advantages over current tools: (i) it can be applied to many forms of nonlinear
models; to continuous or discrete data; to data with homogeneous or
non-homogeneous errors; (ii) it can be applied to any design region; (iii) it
can be applied to multiple-stage optimal design; and (iv) it can be easily
implemented.

stable collisionless stellar disc resemble those of a thermodynamic system
undergoing a gas--liquid phase transition. The maximum in Toomre's stability
diagram, which separates gravitationally stable and unstable states with
respect to axisymmetric perturbations, can be treated as a critical point for
this transition. Static perturbations of stellar density are explored and the
mean perturbation amplitude is considered as the order parameter of the theory.
The disc's state is assumed to change as the disc passes through the critical
point. Since the disc tends to retain hydrostatic equilibrium, structures can
be formed spontaneously, identifiable with a seed spiral structure. A power-law
scaling of the order parameter in the vicinity of the critical point has been
found. The susceptibility and other Landau--Weiss exponents similar to those in
the Van der Waals theory are calculated. The critical behaviour of marginally
stable discs at the initial stage of their evolution occurs in numerical
simulations where snapshots of stellar positions reveal stellar splinters and
crescents diverging from the disc centre. These structures can be a result of
the phase transition. In numerical simulations, these structures eventually
reduce to decaying worm-type features because of the `heating' most likely
resulting from instability of stellar orbits due to resonances. Under
favourable conditions the critical behaviour leading to the establishment of
order in a stellar disc can result in the generation of a spiral structure.

some evidence that the collision energy-kinetic energy difference has been seen

cascade that is supported primarily by Alfv\'en waves or Alfv\'enic
fluctuations at MHD scales and by kinetic Alfv\'en waves (KAWs) at kinetic
scales $k_\perp \rho_i\gtrsim 1$. Linear Landau damping of KAWs increases with
increasing wavenumber and at some point the damping becomes so strong that the
energy cascade is completely dissipated. A model of the energy cascade process
that includes the effects of linear collisionless damping of KAWs and the
associated compounding of this damping throughout the cascade process is used
to determine the wavenumber where the energy cascade terminates. It is found
that this wavenumber occurs approximately when $|\gamma/\omega|\simeq 0.25$,
where $\omega(k)$ and $\gamma(k)$ are, respectively, the real frequency and
damping rate of KAWs and the ratio $\gamma/\omega$ is evaluated in the limit as
the propagation angle approaches 90 degrees relative to the direction of the
mean magnetic field.

when seen in terms of Model Theory. The major advantage of these differential
algebras of generalized functions is that they allow their elements to have
singularities on {\it dense} subsets of their domain of definition, and {\it
without} any restrictions on the respective generalized functions in the
neighbourhood of their singularities. Their applications have so far been in 1)
solving large classes of systems of nonlinear PDEs, 2) highly singular problems
in Differential Geometry, with respective applications in modern Physics,
including General Relativity and Quantum Gravity. These infinite classes of
algebras contain as a particular case the Colombeau algebras, since in the
latter algebras rather strongly limiting growth conditions, namely, of
polynomial type, are required on the generalized functions in the neighbourhood
of their singularities.

stellar mass-to-light ratio values of the sample galaxies by fitting their SDSS
multi-band photometry with composite stellar population models computed with
different dust-free, solar-metallicity templates and IMFs. We compare these
measurements and those derived from two-component orbit-based dynamical
modelling. The photometric and dynamical luminous mass estimates of the
galaxies in our sample are consistent, within the errors, if a Salpeter IMF is
adopted. On the contrary, with a Kroupa or Chabrier IMF the two luminous mass
diagnostics differ at a more than 4 \sigma level. For the massive Coma
galaxies, their stellar mass-to-light ratio scales with luminous mass as the
corresponding effective quantities are observed to scale on the FP. This
indicates that the tilt of the FP is primarily caused by stellar population
properties. We conclude that old, massive lens and non-lens early-type galaxies
obey the same luminous and dynamical scaling relations, favour a Salpeter IMF,
and suggest a stellar population origin for the tilt of the FP. The validity of
these results for samples of early-type galaxies with different age and mass

exactly simulating open-systems: using a finite bath chosen to have certain key

resources required by this method to approximate an open system coupled to an

these states coincide with Thiemann's coherent states with the area operator as

single neurons and ion channel populations to stimuli slows down as the length
of stimulation increases; in fact, no upper bound on temporal time-scales seems
to exist in such systems. Furthermore, patch clamp experiments on single ion
channels have hinted at the existence of large, mostly unobservable,
inactivation state spaces within a single ion channel. This raises the question
of the relation between this multitude of inactivation states and the observed
behavior. In this work we propose a minimal model for ion channel dynamics
which does not assume any specific structure of the inactivation state space.
The model is simple enough to render an analytical study possible. This leads
to a clear and concise explanation of the experimentally observed exponential
history-dependent relaxation in sodium channels in a voltage clamp setting, and
shows that their recovery rate from slow inactivation must be voltage
dependent. Furthermore, we predict that history-dependent relaxation cannot be
created by overly sparse spiking activity. While the model was created with ion
channel populations in mind, its simplicity and genericalness render it a good
starting point for modeling similar effects in other systems, and for scaling
up to higher levels such as single neurons which are also known to exhibit
multiple time scales.

Langevin dynamics simulations. We show that the distributions depend on the
conformation of a chain while the conformation is determined by the chain
stiffness and the salt concentration. We observe that the monovalent
counterions originally condensed on a chain can be replaced by the multivalent
ones dissociated from the added salt due to strong electrostatic interaction.
These newly condensed ions give an important impact on the chain structure. At
low and at high salt concentrations, the conformation of a semiflexible chain
is rodlike. The ion distributions show similarity to those for a rigid chain,
but difference to those for a flexible chain whose conformation is a coil. In
the mid-salt region, the flexible chain and the semiflexible chain collapse but
the collapsed chain structures are, respectively, disordered and ordered
structures. The ion distributions hence show different profiles for these three
chain stiffness with the curves for the semiflexible chain lying between those
for the flexible and the rigid chains. The number of the condensed multivalent
counterions, as well as the effective chain charge, also shows similar
behavior, demonstrating a direct connection with the chain morphology.
Moreover, we find that the condensed multivalent counterions form triplets with
two adjacent monomers and are localized on the chain axis at intermediate salt

highly sensitive to errors in the physical implementation of the unitary
operators. This poses an intrinsic limitation to the size of the database that
can be practically searched. The lack of robustness of Grover's algorithm for a
large number of qubits is due to quite stringent ""phase-matching"" condition. To
overcome this limitation, Tulsi suggested a modified search algorithm [PRA 78,
022332] which succeeds as long as the errors are reproducible and reversible
while Grover's algorithm fails. Such systematic errors arise often from
imperfections in apparatus setup e.g. the errors arising from imperfect pulse
calibration and offset effect in NMR systems. In this paper, we report the
experimental NMR implementation of the modified search algorithm and its
comparison with the original Grover's algorithm. We experimentally validate the
theoretical predictions made by Tulsi.

problem. The motivation behind this reformulation comes from the fact that for
many optimization problems we cannot evaluate exactly the objective function to
be optimized. Similarly, we may not be able to evaluate exactly the functions
involved in iterative optimization algorithms. For example, we may only have
access to noisy measurements of the functions or statistical estimates provided
through Monte Carlo sampling. This makes iterative optimization algorithms
behave like stochastic maps. Naive global optimization amounts to evolving a
collection of realizations of this stochastic map and picking the realization
with the best properties. This motivates the use of filtering techniques to
allow focusing on realizations that are more promising than others. In
particular, we present a filtering reformulation of global optimization in
terms of a special case of sequential importance sampling methods called
particle filters. The increasing popularity of particle filters is based on the
simplicity of their implementation and their flexibility. For parametric
exponential density estimation problems, we utilize the flexibility of particle
filters to construct a stochastic global optimization algorithm which converges
to the optimal solution appreciably faster than naive global optimization.
Several examples are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the approach.

density matrix representing the so-called pseudo-pure states (PPS). An
initially pure part of a PPS state undergoes unitary and non-unitary
(relaxation) transformations during a computation process, causing a ""loss of
purity"" until the equilibrium is reached. Besides, upon relaxation, the nuclear
polarization varies in time, a fact which must be taken into account when
comparing density matrices at different instants. Attempting to use time-fixed
normalization procedures when relaxation is present, leads to various anomalies
on matrices populations. On this paper we propose a method which takes into
account the time-dependence of the normalization factor. From a generic form
for the deviation density matrix an expression for the relaxing initial pure
state is deduced. The method is exemplified with an experiment of relaxation of
the concurrence of a pseudo-entangled state, which exhibits the phenomenon of
sudden death, and the relaxation of the Wigner function of a pseudo-cat state.

technology in a novel way for encryption. Two distinct and separate methods are
presented.
  Method 1: Alter the symbol set of the language by adding additional redundant
symbols for frequent symbols. This will reduce the high frequency of more
commonly used symbols. Hence, frequency analysis upon ciphertext will not be
possible. Hence, decryption will be possible.
  Method 2: Computers use binary base 2. Most encryption systems use ciphering
to convert data to ciphertext. The author presents the theory and several
possible implementations of a method for computers analogous to speaking
another language. This is done by using a binary base other than base 2. Ex.
Fibonacci, Phi or Prime.
  In addition, steganography may be used for creating alternate binary bases.
  This kind of encryption significantly increases the complexity of decryption.
First the binary base must be known. Only then, can decryption begin.
  This kind of encryption also breaks the transitivity of
plaintext-codebook-binary; the correlation of letters-ASCII-base2. With this
transitivity broken, decryption is logically impossible. Coupled with
encrypting the plaintext, binary encryption makes decryption uncrackable. It
may produce false positives--information theoretic secure, and requires much
more computing power to resolve than is currently used in brute force
decryption. Hence, the assertion that these combination of methods are
computationally secure--impervious to brute force.
  The proposed system has a drawback. It is not as compressed as a base2.
(Similar to adding random padding to the encryption.) However, this is
acceptable, since the goal is very strong encryption:
  Both methods are not decryptable by method uncrackable - by conventional,
statistical means.

techniques from continuum percolation and ergodicity, we establish the scaling
law of the minimum multihop delay with respect to the source-destination
distance in cognitive radio networks. When the propagation delay is negligible,
we show the starkly different scaling behavior of the minimum multihop delay in
instantaneously connected networks as compared to networks that are only
intermittently connected due to scarcity of spectrum opportunities.
Specifically, if the network is instantaneously connected, the minimum multihop
delay is asymptotically independent of the distance; if the network is only
intermittently connected, the minimum multihop delay scales linearly with the
distance. When the propagation delay is nonnegligible but small, we show that

D-mesons where contamination from the final state interactions is absent. Thus
we hope that the model-dependence of the extraction can be somehow alleviated.
Once $BR(D\to\eta'+\bar l+\nu_l)$ is measured, we can further determine all the
mixing parameters for $\eta-\eta'-G$. As more data are accumulated, the
determination will be more accurate. In this work, we obtain the transition
matrix elements of $D_{(s)}\to \eta^{(\prime)}$ using the light-front quark
model whose feasibility and reasonability for such processes have been tested.

$\theta$-super positive graphs in this paper. Though a 0-super positive graph
may not contain any cycle, we show that a $\theta$-super positive graph with

$\theta$-super positive graphs, namely $\theta$-elementary and $\theta$-base

can be constructed by adding certain type of edges to a disjoint union of
$\theta$-base graphs; moreover, these $\theta$-base graphs are uniquely
determined by $G$. We also give a characterization of $\theta$-elementary

$\theta$-barrier sets form a partition of $V(G)$. Here, $\theta$-elementary

neutral graphene is examined in this paper. It is found that application of a
small staggered modulated magnetic field does not destroy the Dirac-cone
structure of graphene and so preserves its 4-fold zero-energy degeneracy. The
original Dirac points (DPs) are just shifted to other positions in k space. By
varying the staggered field gradually, new DPs with exactly the same
electron-hole crossing energy as that of the original DPs, are generated, and
both the new and original DPs are moving continuously. Once two DPs are shifted
to the same position, they annihilate each other and vanish. The process of
generation and evolution of these DPs with the staggered field is found to have
a very interesting patten, which is examined carefully. Generally, there exists
a corresponding branch of anisotropic massless fermions for each pair of DPs,
resulting in that each Landau level (LL) is still 4-fold degenerate except the
zeroth LL which has a robust $4n_t$-fold degeneracy with nt the number of pairs
of DPs. As a result, the Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy}$ shows a step of size
$4n_te^2/h$ across zero energy.

84 SG stars and 79 MS stars. In spite of the fact that SG and MS span the same
temperature range we find that the equivalent widths of the Li I doublet in SG
stars are systematically larger than those in MS stars, suggesting a higher Li
content among SG stars. This is confirmed by our quantitative analysis. We
derived the effective temperatures, from H$\alpha$ fitting, and NLTE Li
abundances of the stars in our the sample, using 3D and 1D models. We find that
SG stars have a mean Li abundance higher by 0.1dex than MS stars, using both 1D

temperature. These results provide an unambiguous evidence that the Li
abundance changes with evolutionary status. The physical mechanisms responsible
for this behaviour are not yet clear, and none of the existing models seems to
describe accurately these observations. Based on these conclusions, we believe

measurements of the temperature dependence and gate-voltage dependence of the
contact-corrected field-effect conductivity. Several analytical methods to
calculate the trap DOS from the measured data were used to clarify, if the
different methods lead to comparable results. We also used computer simulations
to further test the results from the analytical methods. Most methods predict a
trap DOS close to the valence band edge that can be very well approximated by a
single exponential function with a slope in the range of 50-60 meV and a trap
density at the valence band edge of approx. 2x10E21 eV-1cm-3. Interestingly,
the trap DOS is always slightly steeper than exponential. An important finding
is that the choice of the method to calculate the trap DOS from the measured
data can have a considerable effect on the final result. We identify two
specific simplifying assumptions that lead to significant errors in the trap
DOS. The temperature-dependence of the band mobility should generally not be
neglected. Moreover, the assumption of a constant effective accumulation layer
thickness leads to a significant underestimation of the slope of the trap DOS.

non-Gaussian primordial density fluctuations. Cosmological initial conditions
deviating from Gaussianity have recently attracted much attention in the
literature, especially with respect to their effect on the formation of
non-linear structures and because of the bounds that they can put on the
inflationary epoch. The fully non-linear matter power spectrum was evaluated
with the use of the physically motivated, semi-analytic halo model, where the
mass function and linear halo bias were suitably corrected for non-Gaussian
cosmologies. In agreement with previous work, we found that a level of
non-Gaussianity compatible with CMB bounds and with positive skewness produces
an increase in power of the order of a few percent at intermediate scales. We
then used the matter power spectrum, together with observationally motivated
background source redshift distributions in order to compute the cosmological
weak lensing power spectrum. We found that the degree of deviation from the
power spectrum of the reference Gaussian model is small compared to the
statistical error expected from even future weak lensing surveys. However,
summing the signal over a large range of multipoles can beat down the noise,
bringing to a significant detection of non-Gaussianity at the level of
$|f_\mathrm{NL}| \simeq $ few tens, when all other cosmological parameters are
held fixed. Finally, we have shown that the constraints on the level of
non-Gaussianity can be improved by $\sim 20%$ with the use of weak lensing
tomography.

infrastructure networks, e.g. in metro areas. Nodes in these networks
frequently employ directional antennas to improve spatial throughput. In such
networks, given a source and destination, it is of interest to compute an
optimal path and channel assignment on every link in the path such that the
path bandwidth is the same as that of the link bandwidth and such a path
satisfies the constraint that no two consecutive links on the path are assigned
the same channel, referred to as ""Channel Discontinuity Constraint"" (CDC).
CDC-paths are also quite useful for TDMA system, where preferably every
consecutive links along a path are assigned different time slots.
  This paper contains several contributions. We first present an $O(N^{2})$
distributed algorithm for discovering the shortest CDC-path between given
source and destination. This improves the running time of the $O(N^{3})$
centralized algorithm of Ahuja et al. for finding the minimum-weight CDC-path.
Our second result is a generalized $t$-spanner for CDC-path; For any $\theta>0$

the spanner in a distributed manner using only $O(n\log{n})$ messages. An
important conclusion of this scheme is in the case of directional antennas are
used. In this case, it is enough to consider only the two closest nodes in each

the modal mu-calculus for this problem. First, we analyze the periodic
behaviour of CTL over OCPs and derive a model checking algorithm whose running
time is exponential only in the number of control locations and a syntactic

fixed OCPs against CTL formulas with a fixed leftward until depth is in P. This
generalizes a result of the first author, Mayr, and To for the expression
complexity of CTL's fragment EF. Second, we prove that already over some fixed
OCP, CTL model checking is PSPACE-hard. Third, we show that there already
exists a fixed CTL formula for which model checking of OCPs is PSPACE-hard. For
the latter, we employ two results from complexity theory: (i) Converting a

an age-metallicity relation that also depends on the galactocentric distance,
(ii) the use of an age-metallicity relation obtained for the galactic disk, and
(iii) the determination of ages from the central star masses obtained from the
observed nitrogen abundances. We consider a sample of planetary nebulae in the
galactic disk, most of which ($\sim$ 69%) are located in the solar

CSPN with average uncertainties of 1-2 Gyr, and compare our results with the
expected distribution based both on the observed mass distribution of white
dwarfs and on the age distribution derived from available mass distributions of

that the age distribution is peaked around 2-4 Gyr.

The open cluster M11 has been studied as a part of the RACE-OC project
(Rotation and ACtivity Evolution in Open Clusters), which is aimed at exploring
the evolution of rotation and magnetic activity in the late-type members of
open clusters with different ages. Photometric observations of the open cluster
M11 were carried out in June 2004 using LOAO 1m telescope. The rotation periods
of the cluster members are determined by Fourier analysis of photometric data
time series. We further investigated the relations between the surface
activity, characterized by the light curve amplitude, and rotation. We have
discovered a total of 75 periodic variables in the M11 FoV, of which 38 are
candidate cluster members. Specifically, among cluster members we discovered 6
early-type, 2 eclipsing binaries and 30 bona-fide single periodic late-type
variables. Considering the rotation periods of 16 G-type members of the almost
coeval 200-Myr M34 cluster, we could determine the rotation period distribution

M35 cluster (~150 Myr) and with the older M37 cluster (~550 Myr) shows that G
stars rotate slower than younger M35 stars and faster than older M37 stars. The
measured variation of the median rotation period is consistent with the

becomes more inclined with respect to our line of sight. Newtonian dynamics
without a dark matter halo provide a very poor fit to the rotation curve
derived using the warp model. In the framework of modified Newtonian dynamic
however the 21-cm rotation curve is well fitted by the gravitational potential
traced by the baryonic matter density alone. The inclusion of a dark matter
halo with a density profile as predicted by structure formation in a
hierarchical clustering LambdaCDM cosmology makes the mass model in newtonian
dynamic compatible with the rotation curve data. The dark halo concentration
for the best fit is C=12 and its total mass is 1.2 10^{12} Msun. If a dark halo
model with a constant density core is considered, the core radius has to be
larger than 20 kpc in order for the model to fit to the data. We extrapolate
the best-fit LambdaCDM and constant-density core mass models to very large
galactocentric radii, comparable to the size of the dark matter halo. A
comparison of the predicted mass with the M31 mass determined at such large
radii using other dynamical tracers, confirms the validity of our results. In
particular the LambdaCDM dark halo model which best fits the 21-cm data well
reproduces the M31 mass traced out to 560 kpc. Our estimated total mass of M31

coronal loops is resonant absorption. In this context most of previous studies
neglected the effect of the obvious equilibrium flow along magnetic field
lines. The flows are in general sub-Alfv\'enic and hence comparatively slow.
Here we investigate the effect of an equilibrium flow on the resonant
absorption of linear kink MHD waves in a cylindrical magnetic flux tube with
the aim of determining the changes in the frequency of the forward and backward
propagating waves and in the modification of the damping times due to the flow.
A loop model with both the density and the longitudinal flow changing in the
radial direction is considered. We use the thin tube thin boundary (TTTB)
approximation in order to calculate the damping rates. The full resistive
eigenvalue problem is also solved without assuming the TTTB approximation.
Using the small ratio of flow and Alfv\'en speeds we derive simple analytical
expressions to the damping rate. The analytical expressions are in good
agreement with the resistive eigenmode calculations. Under typical coronal
conditions the effect of the flow on the damped kink oscillations is small when
the characteristic scale of the density layer is similar or smaller than the
characteristic width of the velocity layer. However, in the opposite situation
the damping rates can be significantly altered, specially for the backward
propagating wave which is undamped while the forward wave is overdamped.

host galaxies in May 2005. In this review we summarize our current knowledge of
the galactic and sub-galactic environments of short GRBs, and the implications
for the progenitor population. The most crucial results are: (i) some short
GRBs occur in elliptical galaxies; (ii) the majority of short GRBs occur in
star forming galaxies; (iii) the star forming hosts of short GRBs are distinct
from the host galaxies of long GRBs in terms of star formation rates,
luminosities, and metallicities, and instead appear to be drawn from the
general field galaxy population; (iv) the physical offsets of short GRBs
relative to their host galaxy centers are significantly larger than for long
GRBs; (v) the observed offset distribution agrees well with predictions for the
locations of NS-NS binary mergers; and (vi) unlike long GRBs, which tend to
occur in the brightest regions of their hosts, the environments of short GRBs
generally under-represent the light distribution of their host galaxies. Taken
together, these observations suggest that short GRB progenitors have a wide age
distribution and generally track stellar mass rather than star formation
activity. These results are fully consistent with NS-NS binary mergers, but
partial contribution from prompt or delayed magnetar formation is also
consistent with the data.

correct and that the inclusion of D waves is necessary to obtain a reliable
extraction of the $E_{0+}$ multipole from experimental data. This is due in
large measure to the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in QCD which leads
to very small S-wave contributions. This makes the usual partial wave expansion
less accurate and although D waves are small, their contribution is enhanced
through the interference with P waves, which compromises the S-wave extraction
from data if D waves are not taken into account. In our work we have used Heavy
Baryon Chiral Perturbation Theory to one loop, and up to ${\cal O}(q^4)$, to
account for the S and P waves, while D waves are added in an almost
model-independent way using standard Born terms and vector mesons. We also show

period range (about 1 to 100 days). The CephIIs in the general field of the LMC
follow this relation for periods shorter than about 20 days. At longer period
(the region of the RV Tau stars), the LMC field stars have a significant
scatter and in the mean are more luminous than the PL relation. The OGLEIII
optical data for the LMC field variables show similar trends. Infrared colours
of stars in the RV Tau period range show marked mean differences between three
groupings; the Galactic field, the LMC field, and globular clusters. In the
case of the Galactic field, at least, this may be strongly influenced by
selection effects. In the period range about 4 to 20 days (the W Vir range)
there are stars lying above the PL relation which may be recognized by their
light curves and are all likely to be binaries. The bright Galactic variable,
kappa Pav probably belongs to this group. There is evidence that CephIIs in the
general field (LMC and Galaxy) have a wider range of masses than those in
globular clusters. At present the CephII PL zero-point depends on the pulsation
parallaxes of two stars. Zero-points of RR Lyrae M(V)-[Fe/H] and Ks-log P

case of the optimized X-ray FEL, studied in detail. Applying similarity
techniques to the results of numerical simulations allowed us to find universal
scaling relations for the main characteristics of an X-ray FEL operating in the
saturation regime: efficiency, coherence time and degree of transverse

they are functions of only the ratio of the geometrical emittance of the

sufficient to strip away the H-rich envelope to yield Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars.
The rich transitional population of Westerlund 1 (Wd 1) provides an ideal
laboratory to observe mass-loss processes throughout the transitional phase of
stellar evolution. An analysis of deep radio continuum observations of Wd 1 is
presented. We detect 18 cluster members. The radio properties of the sample are
diverse, with thermal, non-thermal and composite thermal/non-thermal sources
present. Mass-loss rates are ~10^{-5} solar mass/year across all spectral
types, insufficient to form WRs during a massive star lifetime, and the stars
must undergo a period of enhanced mass loss. The sgB[e] star W9 may provide an
example, with a mass-loss rate an order of magnitude higher than the other
cluster members, and an extended nebula of density ~3 times the current wind.
This structure is reminiscent of luminous blue variables, and one with evidence
of two eras of high, possibly eruptive, mass loss. Three OB supergiants are
detected, implying unusually dense winds. They also may have composite spectra,
suggesting binarity. Spatially resolved nebulae are associated with three of
the four RSGs and three of the six YHGs in the cluster, which are due to
quiescent mass loss rather than outbursts. For some of the cool star winds, the
ionizing source may be a companion star though the cluster radiation density is
sufficiently high to provide the necessary ionizing radiation. Five WR stars
are detected with composite spectra, interpreted as arising in colliding-wind
binaries.

verification. First, the Logic for Partial Function (LPF) used by VDM is
extended to specify memory access using pointers and memory layout of composite
types. Then, the concepts of data-retrieve functions (DRF) and memory-scope
functions (MSF) are introduced in this paper. People can define DRFs to
retrieve abstract values from interconnected concrete data objects. The
definition of the corresponding MSF of a DRF can be derived syntactically from
the definition of the DRF. This MSF computes the set of memory units accessed
when the DRF retrieves an abstract value. This memory unit set is called the
memory scope of the abstract value. Finally, the proof rule of assignment
statements in Hoare's logic is modified to deal with pointers. The basic idea
is that a virtual value keeps unmodified as long as no memory unit in its scope
is over-written. Another proof rule is added for memory allocation statements.
The consequence rule and the rules for control-flow statements are slightly
modified. They are essentially same as their original version in Hoare logic.
  An example is presented to show the efficacy of this logic. We also give some
heuristics on how to verify pointer programs.

  Analysis",,,,"math.AP math.CA math.FA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we develop the theory of Schauder estimates for the fractional
harmonic oscillator $H^\sigma=(-\Delta+|x|^2)^\sigma$, $0<\sigma<1$. More
precisely, a new class of smooth functions $C^{k,\alpha}_H$ is defined, in
which we study the action of $H^\sigma$. It turns out that these spaces are the
suited ones for this type of regularity estimates. In order to prove our
results, an analysis of the interaction of the Hermite-Riesz transforms with
the H\""older spaces $C^{k,\alpha}_H$ is needed, that we believe of independent
interest.
  The parallel results for the fractional powers of the Laplacian
$(-\Delta)^\sigma$ were applied by Caffarelli, Salsa and Silvestre to the study
of the regularity of the obstacle problem for the fractional Laplacian.

  Review 51, 661-703 (2009)",,,,"cs.DL cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Computer science is a relatively young discipline combining science,
engineering, and mathematics. The main flavors of computer science research
involve the theoretical development of conceptual models for the different
aspects of computing and the more applicative building of software artifacts
and assessment of their properties. In the computer science publication
culture, conferences are an important vehicle to quickly move ideas, and
journals often publish deeper versions of papers already presented at
conferences. These peculiarities of the discipline make computer science an
original research field within the sciences, and, therefore, the assessment of
classical bibliometric laws is particularly important for this field. In this
paper, we study the skewness of the distribution of citations to papers
published in computer science publication venues (journals and conferences). We
find that the skewness in the distribution of mean citedness of different
venues combines with the asymmetry in citedness of articles in each venue,
resulting in a highly asymmetric citation distribution with a power law tail.
Furthermore, the skewness of conference publications is more pronounced than
the asymmetry of journal papers. Finally, the impact of journal papers, as
measured with bibliometric indicators, largely dominates that of proceeding
papers.

satisfying certain conditions, we construct a Hilbert C*(H)-module E(X)
equipped with a left action of C*(G), which generalises Rieffel's construction
of inducing modules. Considering G to be a semisimple Lie group and H to be the
Levi component L of a parabolic subgroup P=LN, the Hilbert module associated to
X=G/N encodes the P-series representations of G coming from parabolic subgroups
associated to P. We provide several descriptions of this Hilbert module,
corresponding to the classical pictures of P-series. We then characterise the
bounded operators on E(G/N) that commute to the left action of C*(G) as central
multipliers of C*(L) and interpret this result as a globalised generic
irreducibility theorem. Finally, we establish the convergence of intertwining
integrals on a dense subset of E(G/N).

been of interest for many years, and play an essential role in Josephson
junctions, superconducting cables, and microwave electronics. In particular,
the maximum critical current achievable in high-Tc wires and tapes is well
known to be limited by the presence of grain boundaries, regions of mismatch
between crystallites with misoriented crystalline axes. In studies of single,
artificially fabricated grain boundaries the striking observation has been made
that the critical current Jc of a grain boundary junction depends exponentially
on the misorientation angle. Until now microscopic understanding of this
apparently universal behavior has been lacking. We present here the results of
a microscopic evaluation based on a construction of fully 3D YBCO grain
boundaries by molecular dynamics. With these structures, we calculate an
effective tight-binding Hamiltonian for the d-wave superconductor with a grain
boundary. The critical current is then shown to follow an exponential
suppression with grain boundary angle. We identify the buildup of charge
inhomogeneities as the dominant mechanism for the suppression of the
supercurrent.
