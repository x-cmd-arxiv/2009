fields correspond to various cosmological signals such as weak gravitational
lensing of the CMB by large-scale structure, screening from patchy
reionization, rotation of the plane of polarization due to magnetic fields or
parity violating physics. Various instrumental systematics such as gain
fluctuations, pixel rotation, differential gain, pointing, differential
ellipticity are also described by the same distortion model. All these
distortions produce B-mode that contaminate the primordial tensor B-modes
signal. In this paper we show that apart from generating B-modes, each
distortion uniquely couples different modes $(\bfl_1\ne \bfl_2)$ of the CMB
anisotropies, generating $<EB>$ correlations which for the primordial CMB are
zero. We describe and implement unbiased minimum variance quadratic estimators
which using the off diagonal correlations in the CMB can extract the map of
distortions. We perform Monte-Carlo simulations to characterize the estimators
and illustrate the level of distortions that can be detected with current and
future experiments. The estimators can be used to look for cosmological
signals, or to check for any residual systematics in the data. As a specific
example of primordial tensor B-mode diagnostics we compare the level of minimum
detectable distortions using our method with maximum allowed distortion level
for the B-modes detection. We show that for any experiment, the distortions
will be detected at high significance using correlations before they would show
up as spurious B-modes in the power spectrum.

sight, is spatially resolved in X-ray (by Chandra), optical and radio
observations. In 2008, the three main Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope
observatories VERITAS, MAGIC and H.E.S.S. coordinated their observations in a
joint campaign from January to May with a total observation time of approx. 120
hours. In February, strong and rapid day-scale TeV flares were detected. VLBA
monitoring observations during the same period showed that the 43 GHz radio
flux density of the unresolved core began to rise at the time of the TeV flares
and eventually reached levels above any previously seen with VLBI. New jet
components appeared during the flare. The localization accuracy of the TeV
instruments of many arcseconds, even for strong sources, is inadequate to
constrain the origin of the emission in the inner jets of AGNs. For M87, with a
6 billion solar mass black hole and a distance of 16.7 Mpc, the VLBA resolution
instead corresponds to 30 by 60 Schwarzschild radii. This is starting to
resolve the jet collimation region. The temporal coincidence of the TeV and
radio flares indicates that they are related and provides the first direct
evidence that the TeV radiation from this source is produced within a few tens
of RS of the radio core, thought to be coincident to within the VLBA resolution
with the black hole.

three-body, normal collisions between solid particles with a liquid coating

an apparatus inspired by the Newton's cradle desktop toy except with wetted
particles. Unlike previous work on two-body systems, which may either
agglomerate or rebound upon collision, four outcomes are possible in three-body
systems: fully agglomerated, Newton's cradle (striker and target particle it
strikes agglomerate), reverse Newton's cradle (targets agglomerate while
striker separates), and fully separated. Post-collisional velocities are
measured over a range of parameters. For all experiments, as the impact
velocity increases, the progression of outcomes observed is fully agglomerated,
reverse Newton's cradle, and fully separated. Notably, as the viscosity of the
oil increases, experiments reveal a decrease in the critical Stokes number (the
Stokes number that demarcates a transition from agglomeration to separation)
for both sets of adjacent particles. A scaling theory is developed based on
lubrication forces and particle deformation and elasticity. Unlike previous
work for two-particle systems, two pieces of physics are found to be critical
in the prediction of a regime map that is consistent with experiments: (i) an
additional resistance upon rebound of the target particles due to the
pre-existing liquid bridge between them (which has no counterpart in
two-particle collisions), and (ii) the addition of a rebound criterion due to
glass transition of the liquid layer at high pressure between colliding

Javalambre Astrophysical Observatory. The measurements have been obtained from
spectrophotometric, photometric and seeing data obtained with different
monitors and instruments on the site and publicly accessible meteorological
satellite data.
  The night-sky optical spectrum observed in a moonless night shows very little
contamination by the typical pollution lines. Their contribution to the
sky-brightness is ~0.06 mag in B, ~0.09 mag in V and ~0.06 mag in R. In
particular, the comparison of the strengths of the Sodium artificial and
natural lines indicates that the site satisfies the IAU recommendations for a
dark site. The zenith-corrected values of the moonless night-sky surface
brightness are B = 22.8 mag arcsec^-2, V = 22.1 mag arcsec^-2, R = 21.5 mag
arcsec^-2, I = 20.4 mag arcsec^-2, which indicates that the site is very dark.
The extinction has been measured for the summer period, with a typical value of
0.22 mag in the V-Band, with the best measured value of 0.18 mag in a totally
photometric night. The median value of the seeing in the V-band for the last
two years (2008-9) is 0.71"", with a mode of 0.58"". The seeing values present a
seasonal pattern, being smaller in summer (~0.69"") than in winter time (0.77"").
For 68% of the analyzed nights the seeing was better than 0.8"" during the
entire night. The seeing is found to be stable for rather long periods, in
particular for the nights with good seeing values. The typical scale, for
nights with the seeing below 0.8"", is about 5 hours for variations within 20%
of the reference value. The fraction of totally clear nights is ~53%, while the
fraction of nights with at least a 30% of the night clear is ~74%.

low-resolution spectrum obtained using the NIRC instrument on the Keck I

reddened (Av ~ 15-16) brown dwarf whose effective temperature is in the range
1200-1800 K. For an assumed age of 1 Myr, comparison with isochrones further
constrains the temperature to ~ 1400 K and suggests a mass of ~ 2-3 Jupiter
masses. The inferred temperature is suggestive of an early T spectral type,
which is supported by spectral morphology consistent with weak methane
absorption. Based on its inferred distance (~ 100 pc) and the presence of
overlying visual absorption, it is very likely to be a rho Oph cluster member.
In addition, given the estimated spectral type, it may be the youngest and
least massive T dwarf found so far. Its existence suggests that the initial
mass function for the rho Oph star-forming region extends well into the
planetary-mass regime.

select for curvature as small as is observed (relative somewhat larger values),

cascades of lower energy photons and electrons. The collective intensity of a
cosmological population emitting at very-high energies (VHE) will be attenuated
at the highest energies through interactions with the EBL and enhanced at lower
energies by the resulting cascade. We calculate the cascade radiation created

the collective intensity of blazars and the resulting effects on the

enhances the collective intensity from blazars at high energies before turning
over due to attenuation. The prominence of the resulting features depends on
the blazar gamma-ray luminosity function, spectral index distribution, and the
model of the EBL. We additionally calculate the cascade radiation from the
distinct spectral sub-populations of blazars, BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs) and
flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), finding that the collective intensity of
BL Lacs is considerably more enhanced by cascade radiation than that of the
FSRQs due to their harder spectra. As such, studies of the blazar contribution

that, contrary to the standard setup, setups based in 8B and 8Li can be

themselves, due to the stronger matter effects granted by the higher energy of
the neutrinos. On the other hand, the longer baseline required for neutrinos to
oscillate at these higher energies reduces the statistics at the detector and
fluxes around three times larger are required to reach the sensitivity to
theta_{13} and CP violation for the smallest values of sin^2 2theta_{13} that
the standard setup provides. We also studied the required suppression factor of
the atmospheric background. In all the setups studied, we found that a
suppression factor of 10^-4 is equivalent to removing completely the
atmospheric background. Suppression factors of order 10^-3 do not imply a
significant loss in sensitivity while suppressions of 10^-2 still allow good CP
discovery potential if sin^2 2theta_{13} > 10^-2 and the flux is not too low.

components straddle the L dwarf/T dwarf transition. These sources were culled
from a large near-infrared spectral sample of L and T dwarfs observed with the
Infrared Telescope Facility SpeX spectrograph. Candidates were selected on the
basis of spectral ratios which segregate known (resolved) L dwarf/T dwarf pairs
from presumably single sources. Composite templates, constructed by combining
13581 pairs of absolute flux-calibrated spectra, are shown to provide
statistically superior fits to the spectra of our seventeen candidates as
compared to single templates. Ten of these candidates appear to have secondary
components that are significantly brighter than their primaries over the
1.0-1.3 micron band, indicative of rapid condensate depletion at the L dwarf/T
dwarf transition. Our results support prior indications of enhanced
multiplicity amongst early-type T dwarfs; 53+/-7% of the T0-T4 dwarfs in our
spectral sample are found to be either resolved or unresolved (candidate)
pairs, although this is consistent with an intrinsic (volume complete) brown
dwarf binary fraction of only 15%. If verified, this sample of spectral
binaries more than doubles the number of known L dwarf/T dwarf transition
pairs, enabling a broader exploration of this poorly-understood phase of brown
dwarf atmospheric evolution.

stringently test and potentially rule out a cosmological constant. While

remarkable that they are typically within a factor of 2-3 of forecasts for

LambdaCDM predictions by substantially more than 2% would rule out not only a

functions for the isothermal simulations and simulations which include dust
heating are drastically different. In the isothermal simulation, we do not form
any objects with masses above 1 Msun. However, the simulation with dust
heating, while missing some of the low-mass objects, forms high-mass objects
(~20 Msun) which have a distribution similar to the Salpeter IMF. The envelope
density profiles around the stars formed in our simulation match observed
values around isolated, low-mass star-forming cores. We find the accretion
rates to be highly variable and, on average, increasing with final stellar
mass. By including radiative feedback from stars in a cluster-scale simulation,
we have determined that it is a very important effect which drastically affects
the mass function and yields important insights into the formation of massive
stars.

currents the star's cooling is not affected until it reaches 10^9 K; thereafter
the current replaces neutrino emission as the dominant cooling process. A

external to stress the independence of this form of noise from activity driven
by the stimulus. Variability can also be generated internally by the same
network dynamics that generates responses to a stimulus. How can we distinguish
between external and internal sources of response variability? Here we show
that internal sources of variability interact nonlinearly with stimulus-induced
activity, and this interaction yields a suppression of noise in the evoked
state. This provides a theoretical basis and potential mechanism for the
experimental observation that, in many brain areas, stimuli cause significant
suppression of neuronal variability (Werner and Mountcastle, 1963; Fortier,

two-dimensional vortex lattices driven over a disordered medium. In strong
disorder, when topological order is lost, we show that the depinning transition
is analogous to a second order critical transition: the velocity-force response
at the onset of motion is continuous and characterized by critical exponents.
Combining studies at zero and nonzero temperature and using a scaling analysis,
two critical expo- nents are evaluated. We find v\sim (F-F_c)^\beta with
\beta=1.3\pm0.1 at T=0 and F>F_c, and v\sim T^{1/\delta} with
\delta^{-1}=0.75\pm0.1 at F=F_c, where F_c is the critical driving force at
which the lattice goes from a pinned state to a sliding one. Both critical
exponents and the scaling function are found to exhibit universality with
regard to the pinning strength and different disorder realizations.
Furthermore, the dynamics is shown to be chaotic in the whole critical region.

equilibrium assumption, leads to a system of advection-diffusion PDE's coupled
with algebraic equations. When solving this coupled system, the algebraic
equations have to be solved at each grid point for each chemical species and at
each time step. This leads to a coupled non-linear system. In this paper a
global solution approach that enables to keep the software codes for transport
and chemistry distinct is proposed. The method applies the Newton-Krylov
framework to the formulation for reactive transport used in operator splitting.
The method is formulated in terms of total mobile and total fixed
concentrations and uses the chemical solver as a black box, as it only requires
that on be able to solve chemical equilibrium problems (and compute
derivatives), without having to know the solution method. An additional
advantage of the Newton-Krylov method is that the Jacobian is only needed as an
operator in a Jacobian matrix times vector product. The proposed method is
tested on the MoMaS reactive transport benchmark.

sight to the Sgr B molecular cloud complex 85 pc to the east of Sgr A*. The
sightline to the west passes through two dense clouds of unusually high
negative velocities and also appears to sample a portion of the expanding
molecular ring. The spectra toward Sgr B reveal at least ten absorption
components covering over 200 km/s and by far the largest equivalent width ever
observed in an interstellar H3+line; they appear to provide the first
near-infrared view into that hotbed of star formation.

The players have an attitude that ranges from optimism to pessimism in the face
of uncertainty. Given the attitudes, each player forms a belief about the set
of possible strategies of the other player. If these beliefs are consistent,
one says that they form an uncertainty equilibrium. One then considers a
two-phase game where the players first choose their attitude and then play the
resulting game. The paper illustrates these notions with a number of games
where the approach provides a new insight into the plausible strategies of the
players.

component ""Z CMa NW"" embedded in a dust cocoon and a less massive component ""Z
CMa SE"", which is classified as a FU Orionis type star. Recently, the system
showed the largest outburst reported during the almost 90 years of available
observations. During the recent outburst we detect that the Z CMa system is
polarized by 2.6% in the continuum and emission line spectrum, with a position
angle still perpendicular to the jet. From the high level of polarization we
conclude that the outburst is associated with the dust embedded Herbig AeBe NW
component. The main result of our studies is that the bolometric luminosity of
Z CMa remained surprisingly constant during the recent ""outburst"". We conclude
that either the geometry of the cavity through which the light escapes from the
cocoon has opened a new path, or that the screen of dust, which reflects the
light toward the observer became more efficient causing the observed increase
of the visual brightness by about 2.5 magnitudes.

approaches are useful in order to obtain estimators of simple functional
quantities, without being obliged to store all the data. We propose here a
Horvitz--Thompson estimator of the mean trajectory. In the context of a
superpopulation framework, we prove under mild regularity conditions that we
obtain uniformly consistent estimators of the mean function and of its variance
function. With additional assumptions on the sampling design we state a
functional Central Limit Theorem and deduce asymptotic confidence bands.
Stratified sampling is studied in detail, and we also obtain a functional
version of the usual optimal allocation rule considering a mean variance
criterion. These techniques are illustrated by means of a test population of
N=18902 electricity meters for which we have individual electricity consumption
measures every 30 minutes over one week. We show that stratification can
substantially improve both the accuracy of the estimators and reduce the width
of the global confidence bands compared to simple random sampling without
replacement.

  The three-dimensional affine group $Aff(3)$ is proposed as a geometric
interpretation for the matrix defined by the three generations, with the three

lattice space $(Aff(3) \otimes C)(Z^3)$ allows a simple condensed matter

operators based on canonical quantization is given.
  A set of axioms of the gauge action is defined such that the gauge action of
the SM gauge group $SU(3)_c x SU(2)_L x U(1)_{Y}$ is the maximal possible one.
This includes preservation of Euclidean symmetry and the symplectic structure,
anomaly freedom, ground state neutrality, and the possibility of realization on
the lattice. Strong interactions are realized as Wilson-like gauge fields, weak
gauge fields as effective gauge fields describing lattice deformations, and the
EM field as a combination of above types.

is investigated. The proposed methodology uses antibodies labeled with
organically inert metals with a high atomic number. Irradiation using photons
with energies in the kilo--electron volt (keV) range show an increase in dose
due to a combination of an increase in photo-electric interactions and a
pronounced generation of Auger and/or Coster-Kronig (A-CK) electrons.
  Methods: The dependency of the dose deposition on various factors is
investigated using Monte Carlo simulation models. The factors investigated
include: agent concentration, spectral dependency looking at mono--energetic
sources as well as classical bremsstrahlung sources. The optimization of the
energy spectrum is performed in terms of physical dose enhancement as well as
the dose deposited by Auger and/or Coster-Kronig electrons and their biological
effectiveness.
  Results: A quasi-linear dependency on concentration and an exponential
decrease within the target medium is observed. The maximal dose enhancement is
dependent on the position of the target in the beam. Apart from irradiation
with low photon energies (10 - 20 keV) there is no added benefit from the
increase in generation of Auger electrons. Interestingly, a regular 110kVp
bremsstrahlung spectrum shows a comparable enhancement in comparison with the
optimized mono--energetic sources.
  Conclusions: In conclusion we find that the use of nano-particle enhanced
shows promise to be implemented quite easily in regular clinic on a physical
level due to the advantageous properties in classical beams.
