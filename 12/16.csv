Interferometer Space Antenna, are expected to observe black hole coalescences
to high redshift and with large signal-to-noise ratios, rendering their
gravitational waves ideal probes of fundamental physics. The promotion of
Newton's constant to a time-function introduces modifications to the binary's
binding energy and the gravitational wave luminosity, leading to corrections in
the chirping frequency. Such corrections propagate into the response function
and, given a gravitational wave observation, they allow for constraints on the
first time-derivative of Newton's constant at the time of merger. We find that
space-borne detectors could indeed place interesting constraints on this
quantity as a function of sky position and redshift, providing a
{\emph{constraint map}} over the entire range of redshifts where binary black
hole mergers are expected to occur. A LISA observation of an equal-mass
inspiral event with total redshifted mass of 10^5 solar masses for three years
should be able to measure $\dot{G}/G$ at the time of merger to better than
10^(-11)/yr.

explanation for glitches in the angular power spectrum of temperature

as well be artifacts of noise or cosmic variance. Using the effective Delta
chi^2 between the best-fit power-law spectrum and a deconvolved primordial
spectrum as a measure of ""featureness"" of the data, we perform a full
Monte-Carlo analysis to address the question of how significant the recovered
features are. We find that in 26% of the simulated data sets the reconstructed
spectrum yields a greater improvement in the likelihood than for the actually
observed data. While features cannot be categorically ruled out by this
analysis, and the possibility remains that simple theoretical models which
predict some of the observed features might stand up to rigorous statistical
testing, our results suggest that WMAP data are consistent with the assumption
of a featureless power-law primordial spectrum.

product state wave function, or THSR alpha cluster wave function, for the
description of the ground state in 8Be, the Hoyle state in 12C, and analogous
states in heavier nuclei, are elaborated in detail. For instance, the influence
of antisymmetrisation in the Hoyle state on the bosonic character of the alpha
particles is studied carefully. It is shown to be weak, so that bosonic aspects
are predominant. The de Broglie wave length of alpha particles in the Hoyle
state is shown to be much larger than the inter-alpha distance. It is pointed
out that the bosonic features of low density alpha gas states have measurable
consequences, one of which, that is enhanced multi-alpha decay properties,
likely already have been detected. Consistent with experiment, the width of the
proposed analogue to the Hoyle state in 16O at the excitation energy of
E_x=15.1 MeV is estimated to be very small (34 keV), lending credit to the
existence of heavier Hoyle-like states. The intrinsic single boson density
matrix of a self-bound Bose system can, under physically desirable boundary
conditions, be defined unambiguously. One eigenvalue then separates out, being
close to the number of alpha's in the system. Differences between Brink and
THSR alpha cluster wave functions are worked out. No cluster model of the Brink
type can describe the Hoyle state with a single configuration. On the contrary,
many superpositions of the Brink type are necessary, implying delocalisation
towards an alpha product state. It is shown that single alpha particle orbits
in condensates of different nuclei are almost the same. It is thus argued that
alpha particle antisymmetrised product states of the THSR type are a very
promising novel and useful concept in nuclear physics.

separated planets (IWA > 108mas), this second occulter is designed to operate
at a second closer distance where it provides 10^-12 suppression from
700-1000nm. We have also explored occulter/coronagraph hybrid systems, and
found that an AIC coronagraph that exploits the symmetry of the PSF at the
occulter can improve performance; however, it requires very accurate tolerances
on the occulter manufacturing of the telescope/occulter system as the AIC does
not cancel asymmetric terms. Other coronagraphs proved infeasible, primarily
due to the fact that the residual starlight from the occulter is not a plane
wave, and so is poorly suppressed by the coronagraph.

folded RXTE light curves seem to indicate complex changes in the geometry of
the accretion regions on the surface of the neutron star, which may be
indicative of an inhomogeneous density distribution in the circumstellar

response to nonmagnetic perturbations, whereby droplets of spin-density wave
(SDW) order can form around impurities and the cores of vortices. In a simple
picture, whenever SC is suppressed locally, SDW order is nucleated. Within a
mean-field theory of d-wave SC in an applied magnetic field including disorder
and Hubbard correlations, we show in fact that the creation of SDW order is not
simply due to suppression of the SC order parameter, but rather due to a
correlation-induced splitting of the electronic bound state created by the
perturbation. Since the bound state exists because of the sign change of the
order parameter along quasiparticle trajectories, the induced SDW order is a
direct consequence of the d-wave symmetry. Furthermore the formation of
anti-phase domain walls is important for obtaining the correct temperature
dependence of the induced magnetism as measured by neutron diffraction.

the longitudinal and transverse degrees of freedom and work out analytically
the output state under the Born approximation using a Gaussian localized

coherent control of the output channels. The robustness of this approximation
is studied by comparing the stationary scattering theory to numerical

method to determine the longitudinal coherence length of a guided atom laser.
Then, we detail the non-perturbative regime of the interaction of the guided

non-perturbative effects such as the occurrence of confinement-induced

exists a neighborhood $U$ of 0 in $\tau$ such that $U$ fails to be a
neighborhood of zero in any Hausdorff group topology on $G$ which is strictly
coarser than $\tau.$ Examples of locally minimal groups are all subgroups of
Banach-Lie groups, all locally compact groups and all minimal groups.
  Motivated by the fact that locally compact NSS groups are Lie groups, we
study the connection between local minimality and the NSS property,
establishing that under certain conditions, locally minimal NSS groups are
metrizable.
  A symmetric subset of an abelian group containing zero is said to be a GTG
set if it generates a group topology in an analogous way as convex and
symmetric subsets are unit balls for pseudonorms on a vector space. We consider
topological groups which have a neighborhood basis at zero consisting of GTG
sets. Examples of these locally GTG groups are: locally pseudo--convex spaces,
groups uniformly free from small subgroups (UFSS groups) and locally compact
abelian groups. The precise relation between these classes of groups is
obtained: a topological abelian group is UFSS if and only if it is locally
minimal, locally GTG and NSS. We develop a universal construction of GTG sets
in arbitrary non-discrete metric abelian groups, that generates a strictly
finer non-discrete UFSS topology and we characterize the metrizable abelian
groups admitting a strictly finer non-discrete UFSS group topology. We also
prove that a bounded abelian group $G$ admits a non-discrete locally minimal

G/H=Sp(2,2)xSp(4)/SU(2)^4 gauged WZW model deformed by an integrable potential
and coupled to fermions. This theory is UV finite and is conjectured to be
related to the superstring theory also at the quantum level. Expanded near the
trivial vacuum it has the same elementary excitations (8+8 massive bosonic and
fermionic 2-d degrees of freedom) as the AdS_5 x S^5 superstring in the
light-cone gauge or near plane-wave expansion. In contrast to the superstring
case, the interaction terms in the reduced action are manifestly 2-d Lorentz
invariant. Since the theory is integrable, its S-matrix should be effectively
determined by the two-particle scattering. Here we explicitly compute the
tree-level two-particle S-matrix for the elementary excitations of the reduced

affected by the development of the non-linear theory of particle acceleration
at shock waves. Here we discuss the implications of applying such theory to the
calculation of the spectrum of cosmic rays at Earth as accelerated in supernova
remnants and propagating in the Galaxy. The spectrum is calculated taking into
account the dynamical reaction of the accelerated particles on the shock, the
generation of magnetic turbulence which enhances the scattering near the shock,
and the dynamical reaction of the amplified field on the plasma. Most
important, the spectrum of cosmic rays at Earth is calculated taking into
account the flux of particles escaping from upstream during the Sedov-Taylor
phase and the adiabatically decompressed particles confined in the expanding
shell and escaping at later times. We show how the spectrum obtained in this
way is well described by a power law in momentum with spectral index close to
-4, despite the concave shape of the instantaneous spectra of accelerated
particles. On the other hand we also show how the shape of the spectrum is
sensible to details of the acceleration process and environment which are and
will probably remain very poorly known.

~10^{42}-10^{45} erg s^{-1} and are detected up to redshift ~4. We constrain
the overall properties of the broad band continuum, soft excess and X-ray
absorption, along with their dependence on the X-ray luminosity and redshift
and we discuss the implications for models of AGN emission. We constrained the
mean spectral index of the broad band X-ray continuum to <Gamma>=1.96+-0.02
with intrinsic dispersion sigma=0.27_{-0.02}^{+0.01}. The continuum becomes
harder at faint fluxes and at higher redshifts and luminosities. The dependence
of Gamma with flux is likely due to undetected absorption rather than to
spectral variation. We found a strong dependence of the detection efficiency of
objects on the spectral shape which can have a strong impact on the measured
mean continuum shapes of sources at different redshifts and luminosities. We
detected excess absorption in ~3% of our objects, with column densities ~a few
x10^{22} cm^{-2}. The apparent mismatch between the optical classification and
X-ray properties of these objects is a challenge for the standard AGN
unification model. We found that the fraction of objects with detected soft
excess is ~36%. Using a thermal model, we constrained the soft excess mean
temperature and intrinsic dispersion to <kT>~100 eV and sigma~34 eV. The origin
of the soft excess as thermal emission from the accretion disk or Compton
scattered disk emission is ruled out on the basis of the temperatures detected

Poisson equation ($\nabla^{2}\Phi=0$) for an azimuthally symmetric setting,
i.e., for a spinning gravitational system like the Sun. We seek the general
solution of the form $\Phi=\Phi(r,\theta)$. This general solution is
constrained such that in the zeroth order approximation it reduces to Newton's
well known inverse square law of gravitation. For this general solution, it is
seen that it has implications on the orbits of test bodies in the gravitational
field of this spinning body. We show that to second order approximation, this
azimuthally symmetric gravitational field is capable of explaining at least two
things (1) the observed perihelion shift of solar planets (2) that the mean
Earth-Sun distance must be increasing -- this resonates with the observations
of two independent groups of astronomers (Krasinsky & Brumberg 2004; Standish
2005) who have measured that the mean Earth-Sun distance must be increasing at
a rate of about $7.0\pm0.2 m/cy$ (Standish 2005) to $15.0\pm0.3 m/cy$
(Krasinsky & Brumberg 2004). In-principle, we are able to explain this result
as a consequence of loss of orbital angular momentum -- this loss of orbital
angular momentum is a direct prediction of the theory. Further, we show that
the theory is able to explain at a satisfactory level the observed secular
increase Earth Year ($1.70\pm0.05 ms/yr$; Miura et al. 2009}). Furthermore, we
show that the theory makes a significant and testable prediction to the effect
that the period of the solar spin must be decreasing at a rate of at least
$8.00\pm2.00 s/cy$.

corrections to the conductivity despite the small values of the product of the

that the necessary condition for the observation of quantum contributions to
the carrier transport, quantum coherence over times much longer than the
elastic scattering time, is not met in our samples. Above 0.5 K we observe a
temperature and magnetic field dependent resistivity that closely resembles a
Kondo anomaly for $x$ less than that required to form a long range magnetic
state, $x_c$. For $x>x_c$, the resistivity and magnetoresistance resemble that

almost a factor of 2 for samples with $x\sim x_c$ indicating temperature

calculated. Calculations are carried out in the higher-twist scheme, which is
extended to include contributions from multiple transverse scatterings on both
the produced quark and the radiated gluon. The leading length enhanced parts of
these power suppressed contributions are resummed. Various interferences
between such diagrams lead to the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect. We
resum the corrections from an arbitrary number of scatterings and isolate the

network models on the square and triangular lattices, by separating in space
the regions with phase action of magnetic field, where it affects interference
in course of disorder scattering, and the regions with orbital action of
magnetic field, where it bends electron trajectories. In our models, the
disorder mixes counter-propagating channels on the links, while scattering at
the nodes describes the bending of electron trajectories. By introducing a
strong spread in the scattering strengths on the links, we eliminate the
interference and reduce the electron propagation over a network to a
percolation problem. In this limit we establish the form of the disorder vs.
magnetic field phase diagram, which is in agreement with levitation scenario:
energy separating the Anderson and quantum Hall insulating phases floats up to
infinity upon decreasing magnetic field. From numerical study we conclude that
the positions of the weak-field quantum Hall transitions on the phase diagram

inflationary fast roll and then inflationary slow-roll. This evolution is valid
for all regular inflaton potentials. In addition, we find a special (extreme)
slow-roll solution starting at t = -infty in which the fast-roll stages are
absent. At some time t = t_*, the generic evolution backwards in time reaches a
mathematical singu- larity where a(t) vanishes and Hubble becomes singular. We
find the general behaviour near the singularity. The classical inflaton
description is valid for t-t_* > 10 t_{Planck} well before the beginning of
inflation, quantum loop effects are negligible there. The singularity is never
reached in the validity region of the classical treatment and therefore it is
not a real physical phenomenon here. The whole evolution of the fluctuations is
computed. The Bunch-Davies initial conditions (BDic) are generalized for the
present case. The power spectrum gets dynamically modified by the effect of the
fast-roll eras and the BDic choice at a finite time through the transfer
function D(k) of initial conditions. D(0) = 0. D(k) presents a first peak for k
~ 2/eta_0 (eta_0 being the conformal initial time), then oscillates with
decreasing amplitude and vanishes asymptotically for k -> infty. The transfer
function D(k) affects the low CMB multipoles C_l: the change Delta C_l/C_l for

modest variations in the beam shape can be accompanied by large variations in

galaxies (UCDs) are higher than predicted by simple stellar population models
with the canonical stellar initial mass function (IMF). One way to explain this
finding is a top-heavy IMF, so that the unseen mass is provided by additional
remnants of high-mass stars. A possible explanation for why the IMF in UCDs
could be top-heavy while this is not the case in less massive stellar systems
is that encounters between proto-stars and stars become probable in forming
massive systems. However, the required number of additional stellar remnants
proves to be rather high, which raises the question of how their progenitors
would affect the early evolution of a UCD. We have therefore calculated the
first 200 Myr of the evolution of the UCDs, using the particle-mesh code
Superbox. It is assumed that the stellar populations of UCDs were created in an
initial starburst, which implies heavy mass loss during the following
approximately 40 Myr due to primordial gas expulsion and supernova explosions.
We find at the end of the simulations for various initial conditions and
(tabulated) mass-loss histories objects that roughly resemble UCDs. Thus, the
existence of UCDs does not contradict the notion that their stellar populations
formed rapidly and with a top-heavy IMF. We find tentative evidence that the
UCDs may have had densities as high as 10^8 M_sun/pc^3 at birth.

the initial rising phase of the afterglow. We associate the light curve peak at

estimate of the initial Lorentz factor Gamma_0 ~ 200. The red spectral energy
distribution (even in regions not affected by the Lyman-alpha break) provides
secure evidence of a large dust column. However, the inferred extinction curve
shows a prominent flat component between 2000-3000 Angstroms in the rest-frame,
inconsistent with any locally observed template but well-fit by models of dust
formed by supernovae. Time-dependent fits to the extinction profile reveal no
evidence of dust destruction and limit the decrease in the extinction column to
Delta A_3000 < 0.54 mag after t = 50 s in the rest frame. Our observations
provide evidence of a transition in dust properties at z~5, in agreement with

the maps of the photospheric magnetic vector from the inversion of ideal and
noisy Stokes parameters influence the extrapolation of nonlinear force-free
magnetic fields. Methods: We compute nonlinear force-free magnetic fields based
on simulated vector magnetograms, which have been produced by the inversion of
Stokes profiles, computed froma 3-D radiation MHD simulation snapshot. These
extrapolations are compared with extrapolations starting directly from the
field in the MHD simulations, which is our reference. We investigate how line
formation and instrumental effects such as noise, limited spatial resolution
and the effect of employing a filter instrument influence the resulting
magnetic field structure. The comparison is done qualitatively by visual
inspection of the magnetic field distribution and quantitatively by different
metrics. Results: The reconstructed field is most accurate if ideal Stokes data
are inverted and becomes less accurate if instrumental effects and noise are
included. The results demonstrate that the non-linear force-free field
extrapolation method tested here is relatively insensitive to the effects of
noise in measured polarization spectra at levels consistent with present-day
instruments. Conclusions heading: Our results show that we can reconstruct the
coronal magnetic field as a nonlinear force-free field from realistic
photospheric measurements with an accuracy of a few percent, at least in the
absence of sunspots.

the early universe was initially populated by dark matter. Alternative
explanations typically appear exotic compared to the simplicity of thermal
production. However, recent observations and progress from theory suggest that
it may be necessary to be more critical. This is important because ongoing
searches probing the microscopic properties of dark matter typically rely on
the assumption of dark matter as a single, unique, thermal relic. On general
grounds I will argue that non-thermal production of dark matter seems to be a
robust prediction of physics beyond the standard model. However, if such models
are to lead to realistic phenomenology, they must sit in a restrictive
theoretical framework. As we will show, as a consequence of such restrictions,
viable models will result in concrete and testable predictions. Although many
challenges remain, the non-thermal component of such models may offer a new way
to test string theories that are formulated to provide realistic particle
physics near the electroweak scale.

simulations of galaxy formation at z~3. The simulations employ recently
developed recipe for star formation based on the local abundance of molecular
hydrogen, which is tracked self-consistently during the course of simulation.
The phenomenological H2 formation model accounts for the effects of
dissociating UV radiation of stars in each galaxy, as well as self-shielding
and shielding of H2 by dust, and therefore allows us to explore effects of
lower metallicities and higher UV fluxes prevalent in high redshift galaxies on
their star formation. We compare stellar masses, metallicities, and star
formation rates of the simulated galaxies to available observations of the
Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) and find a reasonable agreement. We find that the
Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation exhibited by our simulated galaxies at z~3 is
substantially steeper and has a lower amplitude than the z=0 relation at
Sigma_gas < 100 Msun/pc^2. The predicted relation, however, is consistent with
existing observational constraints for the z~3 Damped Lyman $\alpha$ (DLA) and
LBGs. Our tests show that the main reason for the difference from the local KS
relation is lower metallicity of the ISM in high redshift galaxies. We discuss
several implications of the metallicity-dependence of the KS relation for
galaxy evolution and interpretation of observations.

photometry, from UV-optical, near infrared and mid-infrared (MID-IR).The
detection of signal in the MID-IR Spitzer/IRAC bands 5.8, 8.0 um -- where the
nebular emission contribution is less effective -- suggests the presence of a
Balmer break, signature of an underlying stellar population formed at earlier
epochs. The optical spectrum shows a clear Lya emission line together with
semi-forbidden NIV] 1483.3-1486.5 also in emission. Results: From the SED
fitting and the Lya modelling it turns out that the source seems to have an
evolved component with stellar mass of ~5 x10^(10) Msolar and age ~ 0.4 Gyrs,
and a young component with an age of ~ 0.01 Gyrs and SFR in the range of 30-200
Msolar yr^(-1). The limits on the effective radius derived from the ACS/z850
and VLT/Ks bands indicate that this galaxy is denser than the local ones with
similar mass. A relatively high nebular gas column density is favored from the
Lya line modelling (NHI>=10^(21) cm^(-2)). A vigorous outflow (~ 450 km/s) has
been measured from the optical spectrum,consistent with the Lya modelling. From
ACS observations it turns out that the region emitting Lya photons is spatially
compact and of the same order of the effective radius estimated at the ~1400A
rest-frame wavelength, whose emission is dominated by the stellar continuum
and/or AGN. The gas is blown out from the central region,but given the mass of
the galaxy it is uncertain whether it will pollute the IGM to large distances.
We argue that a burst of star formation in a dense gas environment is active
(possibly containing hot and massive stars and/or a low luminosity AGN),
superimposed to an already formed fraction of stellar mass (abridged).

This is part of an ongoing X-ray/low-frequency radio study of 18 groups,
initially chosen for the availability of good-quality X-ray data and evidence
for AGN/hot gas interaction. At higher frequency (1.4 GHz), the HCG 62 cavity
system shows minimal if any radio emission, but the new GMRT observations at
235 MHz and 610 MHz clearly detect extended low-frequency emission from radio
lobes corresponding to the cavities. By means of the synergy of X-ray and
low-frequency radio observations, we compare and discuss the morphology,
luminosity and pressure of the gas and of the radio source. We find that the
radio source is radiatively inefficient, with a ratio of radio luminosity to
mechanical cavity power of $\sim 10^{-4}$, and that the radio pressure of the
lobes is about one order of magnitude lower than the X-ray pressure of the
surrounding thermal gas. Thanks to the high spatial resolution of the Chandra
surface brightness and temperature profiles, we also identify a shock front
located at 36 kpc to the south-west of the group center, close to the southern
radio lobe, with a Mach number $\sim 1.5$ and a total power which is about one
order of magnitude higher than the cavity power. Such a shock may have heated
the gas in the southern region, as indicated by the temperature map. The shock
may also explain the arc-like region of enriched gas seen in the iron abundance
map, as this may be produced by a non-Maxwellian electron distribution near its
front.

conducted for two different orientations of the single crystals, yielding the

polarizations in-plane and out-of-plane with respect to the basal plane of the

observed upon doping with Co. Increasing pressure to 4 GPa caused a marked
increase of phonon frequencies, with the doped material still stiffer than the
parent compound. Upon cooling, both the doped and undoped samples showed a
stiffening, and the parent compound exhibited a discontinuity across the
magnetic and structural phase transition. These findings are generally
compatible with the changes in volume of the system upon doping, increasing
pressure, or increasing temperature, but an extra softening of high-energy
modes occurs with increasing temperature. First-principles computations of the

explained in terms of a magnetic Grueneisen parameter, causing an extra phonon

the Voyager era, models of evolutionary processes affecting the rings on long
time scales (erosion, viscous spreading, accretion, ballistic transport, etc.)
had suggested that Saturn's rings are not older than 100 My. In addition,
Saturn's large system of diffuse rings has been thought to be the result of
material loss from one or more of Saturn's satellites. In the Cassini era, high
spatial and spectral resolution data have allowed progress to be made on some
of these questions. Discoveries such as the ''propellers'' in the A ring, the
shape of ring-embedded moonlets, the clumps in the F Ring, and Enceladus' plume
provide new constraints on evolutionary processes in Saturn's rings. At the
same time, advances in numerical simulations over the last 20 years have opened
the way to realistic models of the rings's fine scale structure, and progress
in our understanding of the formation of the Solar System provides a
better-defined historical context in which to understand ring formation. All
these elements have important implications for the origin and long-term
evolution of Saturn's rings. They strengthen the idea that Saturn's rings are

4U 1907+09 using the Suzaku observatory. The broadband time-averaged spectrum
allows us to examine the continuum emission of the source and the cyclotron
resonance scattering feature at ~19 keV. Additionally, using the narrow CCD
response of Suzaku near 6 keV allows us to study in detail the Fe K bandpass
and to quantify the Fe K beta line for this source for the first time. The
source is absorbed by fully-covering material along the line of sight with a
column density of NH ~2e22 /cm^2, consistent with a wind accreting geometry,
and a high Fe abundance (~3-4 x solar). Time and phase-resolved analyses allow
us to study variations in the source spectrum. In particular, dips found in the
2006 observation which are consistent with earlier observations occur in the
hard X-ray bandpass, implying a variation of the whole continuum rather than
occultation by intervening material, while a dip near the end of the 2007
observation occurs mainly in the lower energies implying an increase in NH
along the line of sight, perhaps indicating clumpiness in the stellar wind.

nearby molecular dark clouds to show that the ratio of mass to magnetic flux
was smaller in the ~0.1 pc cores than in the ~1 pc envelopes, in contradiction
to the prediction of ambipolar diffusion driven core formation. A crucial
assumption was that the magnetic field direction is nearly the same in the
envelope and core regions of each cloud. Mouschovias and Tassis (2009) have
argued that the data are not consistent with this assumption, and presented a
new analysis that changes the conclusions of the study. Here we show that the
data are in fact consistent with the nearly uniform field direction assumption;
hence, the original study is internally self-consistent and the conclusions are
valid under the assumptions that were made. We also show that the Mouschovias

their own analysis of the data. However, the data do not rule out a more
complex field configuration that future observations may discern.

presented. For more than a century, the Kowalevski 1889 case, attracts full
attention of a wide community as the highlight of the classical theory of
integrable systems. Despite hundreds of papers on the subject, the Kowalevski
integration is still understood as a magic recipe, an unbelievable sequence of
skilful tricks, unexpected identities and smart changes of variables. The
novelty of our present approach is based on our four observations. The first
one is that the so-called fundamental Kowalevski equation is an instance of a
pencil equation of the theory of conics which leads us to a new geometric
interpretation of the Kowalevski variables $w, x_1, x_2$ as the pencil
parameter and the Darboux coordinates, respectively. The second is observation
of the key algebraic property of the pencil equation which is followed by
introduction and study of a new class of {\bf discriminantly separable
polynomials}. All steps of the Kowalevski integration procedure are now derived
as easy and transparent logical consequences of our theory of discriminantly
separable polynomials. The third observation connects the Kowalevski
integration and the pencil equation with the theory of multi-valued groups. The
Kowalevski change of variables is now recognized as an example of a two-valued
group operation and its action. The final observation is surprising equivalence
of the associativity of the two-valued group operation and its action to $n=3$
case of the Great Poncelet Theorem for pencils of conics.

noisy interference regime, i.e., a regime where random coding and treating
interference as noise achieves sum-capacity. Specializing our results to the
Gaussian MIMO many-to-one interference channel, which is a special case of the
class of channels considered, we obtain new capacity results. Firstly, we
extend the noisy interference regime, previously studied for (many-to-one)
interference channels with average power constraints on the inputs, to a more
general class of inputs. This more general class includes the practical
scenario of inputs being restricted to fixed finite-size constellations such as
PSK or QAM. Secondly, we extend noisy interference results previously studied
in SISO interference channels with full channel state information (CSI) at all
nodes, to MIMO and parallel Gaussian many-to-one interference channels, and to
fading Gaussian many-to-one interference channels without CSI at the
transmitters. While the many-to-one interference channel requires interference
alignment, which in turn requires structured codes in general, we argue that in
the noisy interference regime, interference is implicitly aligned by random
coding irrespective of the input distribution. As a byproduct of our study, we
identify a second class of many-to-one interference channels (albeit
deterministic) where random coding is optimal (though interference is not
treated as noise). The optimality of random coding in this second class of
channels is due to an interference resolvability condition which precludes
interference alignment and hence obviates the need of structured codes.

The calibration capability of the Scenario Volatility/Barrier model (SVBAT1P),
when keeping time-constant volatility, appears inferior to the one of AT1P with
time-varying deterministic volatility. The SVBAT1P model, however, maintains
the benefits of time-homogeneity and can lead to satisfactory calibration
results, as we show in a case study where we compare different choices on
scenarios and parameters. Similarly to AT1P, SVBAT1P is suited to pricing
hybrid equity/credit derivatives and to evaluate counterparty risk in equity
payoffs, and more generally to evaluate hybrid credit/equity payoffs. We
consider the equity return swap in Brigo and Tarenghi (2004) and show its

surface brightness (SB) of galaxies at 0.3<z<3, using a deep K-band selected
catalog in the GOODS-North region. The correlation has a nearly constant slope,
independent of redshift and color of galaxies in the rest-z frame. Considering
unresolved compact galaxies, the tight correlation gives a lower boundary of SB
for a given stellar mass; lower SB galaxies are prohibited over the boundary.
The universal slope suggests that the stellar mass in galaxies was build up
over their cosmic histories in a similar manner irrelevant to galaxy mass, as
oppose to the scenario that massive galaxies mainly accumulated their stellar
mass by major merging. In contrast, SB shows a strong dependence on redshift
for a given stellar mass. It evolves as (1+z)^(-2.0~-0.8), in addition to
dimming as (1+z)^4 by the cosmological expansion effect. The brightening
depends on galaxy color and stellar mass. The blue population (rest-frame
U-V<0), which is dominated by young and star-forming galaxies, evolves as
~(1+z)^(-0.8 +-0.3) in the rest-V band. On the other hand, the red population
(U-V>0) and the massive galaxies (M_*>10^(10)M_sun) shows stronger brightening,
(1+z)^(-1.5+-0.1). Based on the comparison with galaxy evolution models, we
find that the phenomena are well explained by the pure luminosity evolution of

maximization problem faced by the principal to a convex program. This is a key
step toward making the principal's problem theoretically and computationally
tractable; in particular, it allows us to derive uniqueness and stability of
the principal's optimum strategy -- and similarly of the strategy maximizing
the expected welfare of the agents when the principal's profitability is

uniform ultraviolet background and find that photoheating strongly reduces the
clumping factor as the increased pressure support smoothes out small-scale
density fluctuations. Even our most conservative estimate for the clumping

employed to determine the capacity of star-forming galaxies to keep the z=6 IGM

a projected distance of 5-10 pc from Westerlund 2 and decreases to as low as 10
K away from the cluster. The high temperature provides robust verification that
the molecular gas is indeed physically associated with the HII region,
supporting Furukawa et al.'s conclusion. The derived temperature is also
roughly consistent with theoretical calculations of photo dissociation regions

databases, we have located 2 galaxies at z~0.5 that have properties similar to
those of the luminous passive compact galaxies found at z~2.5. From Keck
moderate-resolution spectroscopy and laser-guided adaptive-optics imaging of
these galaxies, we can begin to put together a more detailed picture of what
their high-redshift counterparts might be like. Spectral-synthesis models that
fit the u to K photometry also seem to give good fits to the spectral features.
  From these models, we estimate masses in the range of 3-4 10^11 M_sun for
both galaxies. Under the assumption that these are spheroidal galaxies, our
velocity dispersions give estimated masses about a factor of 3 smaller.
However, our high-resolution imaging data indicate that these galaxies are not
normal spheroids, and the interpretation of the kinematic data depends
critically on the actual morphologies and the nature of the stellar orbits.
While recent suggestions that the population of high-redshift compact galaxies
is present locally as the inner regions of local massive elliptical galaxies
are quite plausible, the peak mass surface densities of the two galaxies we
discuss here appear to be up to a factor of 10 higher than those of the highest
density local ellipticals, assuming that our photometric masses are roughly
correct. It thus seems possible that some dynamical ""puffing-up'' of the
high-redshift galaxies might still be required in this scenario.

potential is argued to effectively arise from the integration of massive gauge
bosons and fermions in an underlying fundamental theory. All possible choices
of the vacuum lead only to the remaining invariant subgroups T(2) and HOM(2).
We explore the plane wave solutions of the linearized sector of the model for
an arbitrary vacuum. They present two types of dispersion relations. One
corresponds to the case of the usual Maxwell electrodynamics with the standard
polarization properties of the fields. The other dispersion relation involves
anisotropies determined by the structure of the vacuum. The model is stable in
the small Lorentz invariance violation approximation. We have embedded our
model in the photon sector of the Standard Model Extension in order to set
bounds for our parameters. The one-way anisotropic speed of light is calculated
for a general vacuum and its isotropic component is strongly bounded by
${\tilde \delta c}/c < 2 \times 10^{-32}$. The anisotropic violation
contribution is estimated by introducing an alternative definition for the
difference of the two-way speed of light in perpendicular directions $\Delta
c$, which is also strongly bounded by ${\Delta c}/c < 10^{-32}$. Finally, we
speculate on the relation of the vacuum energy of the model with the
cosmological constant and propose a connection between the vacuum fields and
the intergalactic magnetic fields.

communication. This interest stems from the realization that glia participates
in cognitive functions and information processing and is involved in many brain
disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. An important process in neuron-glia
communications is astrocyte encoding of synaptic information transfer: the
modulation of intracellular calcium dynamics in astrocytes in response to
synaptic activity. Here, we derive and investigate a concise mathematical model
for glutamate-induced astrocytic intracellular Ca2+ dynamics that captures the
essential biochemical features of the regulatory pathway of inositol
1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). Starting from the well-known two-state Li-Rinzel
model for calcium-induced-calcium release, we incorporate the regulation of the
IP3 production and phosphorylation. Doing so we extended it to a three-state
model (referred as the G-ChI model), that could account for Ca2+ oscillations
triggered by endogenous IP3 metabolism as well as by IP3 production by external
glutamate signals. Compared to previous similar models, our three-state models
include a more realistic description of the IP3 production and degradation
pathways, lumping together their essential nonlinearities within a concise
formulation. Using bifurcation analysis and time simulations, we demonstrate
the existence of new putative dynamical features. The cross-couplings between
IP3 and Ca2+ pathways endows the system with self-consistent oscillator
properties and favor mixed frequency-amplitude encoding modes over pure
amplitude modulation ones. These and additional results of our model are in
general agreement with available experimental data and may have important
implications on the role of astrocytes in the synaptic transfer of information.

side of the plasma membrane to targets in their interior. Since virtually all
cells employ a network of biochemical reactions for Ca2+ signalling, much
effort has been devoted to understand the functional role of Ca2+ responses and
to decipher how their complex dynamics is regulated by the biochemical network
of Ca2+-related signal transduction pathways. Experimental observations show
that Ca2+ signals in response to external stimuli encode information via
frequency modulation or alternatively via amplitude modulation. Although
minimal models can capture separately both types of dynamics, they fail to
exhibit different and more advanced encoding modes. By arguments of bifurcation
theory, we propose instead that under some biophysical conditions more complex
modes of information encoding can also be manifested by minimal models. We
consider the minimal model of Li and Rinzel and show that information encoding
can occur by amplitude modulation (AM) of Ca2+ oscillations, by frequency
modulation (FM) or by both modes (AFM). Our work is motivated by calcium
signalling in astrocytes, the predominant type of cortical glial cells that is
nowadays recognized to play a crucial role in the regulation of neuronal
activity and information processing of the brain. We explain that our results
can be crucial for a better understanding of synaptic information transfer.
Furthermore, our results might also be important for better insight on other
examples of physiological processes regulated by Ca2+ signalling.

interestingly, we also study the large deviations rate function associated with

as many as seven phases, and it suggests a two--dimensional generalization of
the notion of BEC (or more generally, a multi--dimensional BEC). While the

finding anti-matter signals in cosmic rays (CRs) from dark matter (DM)
annihilation. Exchange of order 100 GeV radion, an integral part of our setup,
generically results in Sommerfeld enhancement of the annihilation rate for TeV
DM mass. No dark sector is required to obtain boosted annihilation cross
sections. A mild hierarchy between the radion and DM masses can be natural due
to the pseudo-Goldstone boson nature of the radion. Implications of Sommerfeld
enhancement in warped grand unified theory (GUT) models, where proton stability
implies a DM candidate, are studied. We show, via partially unified Pati-Salam
group, how to incorporate a custodial symmetry for Z->b\bar b into the GUT
framework such that a few TeV Kaluza-Klein (KK) mass scale is allowed by
precision tests. The model with smallest fully unified SO(10) representation
allows us to decouple the DM from the electroweak sector. Thus, a correct DM
relic density is obtained and direct detection bounds are satisfied. Looking at
robust CR observables, a possible future signal in the \bar p / p flux ratio is
found. We show how to embed a similar custodial symmetry for the right handed
tau, allowing it to be strongly coupled to KK particles. Such a scenario might
lead to observed signal in CR positrons; however, the DM candidate in this case
can not constitute all of the DM in the universe. Independently of the above,
the strong coupling between KK particles and tau's can lead to striking LHC
signals.

cognitive mobile virtual network operator (C-MVNO) under spectrum supply
uncertainty. Compared with a traditional MVNO who often leases spectrum via
long-term contracts, a C-MVNO can acquire spectrum dynamically in short-term by
both sensing the empty ""spectrum holes"" of licensed bands and dynamically
leasing from the spectrum owner. As a result, a C-MVNO can make flexible
investment and pricing decisions to match the current demands of the secondary
unlicensed users. Compared to dynamic spectrum leasing, spectrum sensing is
typically cheaper, but the obtained useful spectrum amount is random due to
primary licensed users' stochastic traffic. The C-MVNO needs to determine the
optimal amounts of spectrum sensing and leasing by evaluating the trade off
between cost and uncertainty. The C-MVNO also needs to determine the optimal
price to sell the spectrum to the secondary unlicensed users, taking into
account wireless heterogeneity of users such as different maximum transmission
power levels and channel gains. We model and analyze the interactions between
the C-MVNO and secondary unlicensed users as a Stackelberg game. We show
several interesting properties of the network equilibrium, including threshold
structures of the optimal investment and pricing decisions, the independence of
the optimal price on users' wireless characteristics, and guaranteed fair and
predictable QoS among users. We prove that these properties hold for general
SNR regime and general continuous distributions of sensing uncertainty. We show
that spectrum sensing can significantly improve the C-MVNO's expected profit
and users' payoffs.

relationship between slope and supergalactic latitude. The slope near the
supergalactic equator is sub- Euclidean on average pointing to the possibility
of a decreasing average space density of galaxies by ~ 10-15% over scales of ~
250-350 Mpc. On the contrary, the slope at high supergalactic latitudes is
strongly super-Euclidean on average suggesting an increase in the space density
of galaxies as one moves from the voids just above and below the supergalactic
plane out to distances of ~ 250-350 Mpc. These results suggest that local large
scale structure could be responsible for large discrepancies in the measured
slope between different studies in the past. In addition, the local universe

unprecedented survey above 10 keV (a factor ~20 increase in hard X-ray
sensitivity compared to current and prior X-ray missions) of SMBH activity, not
just in space but also in time and over a significant expanded energy range;
this strategy will overcome previous selection biases, will break the

number of AGN detected above 10 keV that are amenable to detailed follow-up
studies (~50000 AGN are expected). We discuss here on few selected AGN science
topics enabled by the unique combination of EXIST's instruments. In particular
EXIST will enable major progress in understanding: i) when and where SMBH are
active in the Universe (by revealing and measuring heavily obscured accretion
in the local - z<0.5 - Universe), ii) the physics of how SMBH accrete (by
studying the broad-band X-ray spectra and variability properties of an unbiased
and significant sample of AGN), and iii) the link between accretion power and
jet/outflow power (by using observations of blazars). Last but not least
EXIST's ability to find powerful, but very rare blazars, enables it to probe
the appearance of the very first SMBH in the Universe allowing us to set strong
constraints on the models of SMBH formation and early growth in the Universe.

metal abundance and a 'normal' He content of Y = 0.25-0.26, marginally
reproduce the components at ages between 1.8 and 2.1 Gyr. All such models are,
however, systematically about 200 K hotter than observed and predict ages for
the more massive component, which are systematically higher than for the less

core overshoot or envelope convection level, or by including rotation in the

the other hand, we find excellent agreement for 2.5-2.8 Gyr Granada models with

the type IIP supernova, SN 2004et. In combination with already published data,
this provides one of the most complete studies of optical and NIR data for any
type IIP SN from just after explosion to +500 days. The contribution of the NIR
flux to the bolometric light curve is estimated to increase from 15% at
explosion to around 50% at the end of the plateau and then declines to 40% at
300 days. SN 2004et is one of the most luminous IIP SNe which has been well
studied, and with a luminosity of log L = 42.3 erg/s, it is 2 times brighter
than SN 1999em. We provide parametrised bolometric corrections as a function of
time for SN 2004et and three other IIP SNe that have extensive optical and NIR
data, which can be used as templates for future events. We compare the physical
parameters of SN 2004et with those of other IIP SNe and find kinetic energies
spanning the range of 10^50-10^51 ergs. We compare the ejected masses
calculated from hydrodynamic models with the progenitor masses and limits
derived from prediscovery images. Some of the ejected mass estimates are
significantly higher than the progenitor mass estimates, with SN 2004et showing
perhaps the most serious mass discrepancy. With current models, it appears
difficult to reconcile 100 day plateau lengths and high expansion velocities
with the low ejected masses of 5-6 Msun implied from 7-8 Msun progenitors. The
nebular phase is studied using very late time HST photometry, along with
optical and NIR spectroscopy. The light curve shows a clear flattening at 600
days in the optical and the NIR, which is likely due to the ejecta impacting on
the CSM. We further show that the [Oi] 6300,6364 Angstrom line strengths of
four type IIP SNe imply ejected oxygen masses of 0.5-1.5 Msun.

which exhibits dynamical compactification. Because of the isometry on S^6,
there are flat directions corresponding to the
  Nambu-Goldstone zero modes in the effective theory on the solution. The zero
modes are absorbed into gauge fields and form massive vector fields as a
consequence of the Higgs-Kibble mechanism. The mass of the vector fields is
proportional to the inverse of the radius of the sphere and larger than the
mass scale set by the radius because of the higher derivative term.

AMR calculations including magnetic field (in the ideal MHD limit) and
radiative transfer, within the Flux Limited Diffusion approximation, of the
collapse of a 1 solar mass dense core. We compare the results with calculations
performed with a barotropic EOS. We show that radiative transfer has an
important impact on the collapse and the fragmentation, through the cooling or
heating of the gas, and is complementary of the magnetic field. A larger field
yields a stronger magnetic braking, increasing the accretion rate and thus the
effect of the radiative feedback. Even for a strongly magnetized core, where
the dynamics of the collapse is dominated by the magnetic field, radiative
transfer is crucial to determine the temperature and optical depth
distributions, two potentially accessible observational diagnostics. A
barotropic EOS cannot account for realistic fragmentation. The diffusivity of
the numerical scheme, however, is found to strongly affect the output of the
collapse, leading eventually to spurious fragmentation. Both radiative transfer
and magnetic field must be included in numerical calculations of star formation
to obtain realistic collapse configurations and observable signatures.
Nevertheless, the numerical resolution and the robustness of the solver are of
prime importance to obtain reliable results. When using an accurate solver, the
fragmentation is found to always remain inhibited by the magnetic field, at
least in the ideal MHD limit, even when radiative transfer is included.

typically achieved by networking with relatively small clusters, our results
suggest that it ought to be possible also to network with peers and larger

of mass differences between survivors and their immediate neighbours, which
show an astonishing universality; they suggest strategies for winning against

solid-like state, known as the jamming transition, occurs in a wide variety of
physical systems, such as colloidal suspensions and molecular fluids, when the
temperature is lowered or the density increased. Shear stress, as temperature,
favors the fluid-like state, and must be also considered to define the system
'jamming phase diagram' [1-4]. Frictionless athermal systems [1], for instance,
can be described by the zero temperature plane of the jamming diagram in the
temperature, density, stress space. Here we consider the jamming of athermal
frictional systems [8-13] such as granular materials, which are important to a
number of applications from geophysics to industry. At constant volume and
applied shear stress[1, 2], we show that while in absence of friction a system
is either fluid-like or jammed, in the presence of friction a new region in the
density shear-stress plane appears, where new dynamical regimes are found. In
this region a system may slip, or even flow with a steady velocity for a long
time in response to an applied stress, but then eventually jams. Jamming in
non-thermal frictional systems is described here by a phase diagram in the
density, shear-stress and friction space.

formation is how Jupiter and Saturn could have formed before the the solar
nebula dispersed. The most popular model of giant planet formation is the
so-called 'core accretion' model. In this model a large planetary embryo formed
first, mainly by two-body accretion. This is then followed by a period of
inflow of nebular gas directly onto the growing planet. The core accretion
model has an Achilles heel, namely the very first step. We have undertaken the
most comprehensive study of this process to date. In this study we numerically
integrate the orbits of a number of planetary embryos embedded in a swarm of
planetesimals. In these experiments we have included: 1) aerodynamic gas drag,
2) collisional damping between planetesimals, 3) enhanced embryo cross-sections
due to their atmospheres, 4) planetesimal fragmentation, and 5) planetesimal
driven migration. We find that the gravitational interaction between the
embryos and the planetesimals lead to the wholesale redistribution of material
- regions are cleared of material and gaps open near the embryos. Indeed, in
90% of our simulations without fragmentation, the region near that embryos is
cleared of planetesimals before much growth can occur. The remaining 10%,
however, the embryos undergo a burst of outward migration that significantly
increases growth. On timescales of ~100,000 years, the outer embryo can migrate
~6 AU and grow to roughly 30 Earth-masses. We also find that the inclusion of
planetesimal fragmentation tends to inhibit growth.

up new models for the turnoff masses and the main sequence down to the hydrogen
burning minimum mass, adopting two versions of an updated equation of state
(EOS) including the OPAL EOS. Models consider different initial helium and CNO
abundances to cover the range of possible variations between the first and
second generation stars. We compare the models with the observational main
sequence. We also make simulations of the theoretical luminosity functions, for
different choices of the mass function and of the mixture of first and second
generation stars, and compare them with the observed luminosity function, by
means of the Kolmogorov Smirnov --KS-- test. The study of the width of the main
sequence at different interval of magnitude is consistent with the hypothesis
that both generations are present in the cluster. If the CNO increase suggested
by spectroscopic observation is taken into account the small helium spread of
the main sequence in NGC 6397 implies a substantial helium uniformity (DY~0.02)
between first and second generation stars. The possible spread in helium
doubles if an even larger increase of CNO is considered. The luminosity

exponentially growing number of Regge states does not preclude the existence of
semi-classical black holes of sub-stringy size. Our analysis indicates that the
effective number of string resonances to which such micro black holes evaporate
is not exponentially large but is bounded by N = 1/g_s^2, which suggests the
interpretation of the well-known relation between the Planck and string scales
as the saturation of the black hole bound on the species number. In addition,

sensitive measure of the absorption feature at 1.6 micron. We use the CH_4

to a regular or chaotic environment. The environment is modelled by a suitably
chosen random matrix ensemble. The exact results exhibit non--perturbative
features as revival of probability and non--ergodicity. The role of background
complexity and of coupling complexity is discussed as well.
