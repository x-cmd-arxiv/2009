orbiting their host star at close proximity. Both theoretical and observational
studies support the hypothesis that such bodies emit significant amounts of
flux relative to the host star, increasing towards infrared wavelengths. For
the dayside of the exoplanet, this phenomenon typically permits detectable
secondary eclipses at such wavelengths, which may be used to infer atmospheric
composition. In this paper, we explore the effects of emission from the
nightside of the exoplanet on the primary transit lightcurve, which is
essentially a self-blend. Allowing for nightside emission, an exoplanet's
transit depth is no longer exclusively a function of the ratio-of-radii. The
nightside of an exoplanet is emitting flux and the contrast to the star's
emission is of the order of ~10^(-3) for hot-Jupiters. Consequently, we show
that the transit depth in the mid-infrared will be attenuated due to flux
contribution from the nightside emission by ~10^(-4). We show how this effect
can be compensated for in the case where exoplanet phase curves have been
measured, in particular for HD 189733b. For other systems, it may be possible
to make a first-order correction by using temperature estimates of the planet.
Unless the effect is accounted for, transmission spectra will also be polluted
by nightside emission and we estimate that a Spitzer broadband spectrum on a
bright target is altered at the 1-sigma level. Using archived Spitzer
measurements, we show that the effect respectively increases the 8.0um and
24.0um transit depths by 1-sigma and 0.5-sigma per transit for HD 189733b.
Consequently, we estimate that this would be 5-10 sigma effect for near-future
JWST observations.

fields reveal a cornucopia of fascinating quantum phenomena such as
fractionally charged quasiparticles, anyonic statistics, topological order, and
many others. Probing these effects in GaAs-based systems, where electron
interactions are relatively weak, requires sub-kelvin temperatures and
record-high electron mobilities, rendering some of the most interesting states
too fragile and difficult to access. This prompted a quest for new
high-mobility systems with stronger electron interactions. Recently,
fractional-quantized Hall effect was observed in suspended graphene (SG), a
free-standing monolayer of carbon, where it was found to persist up to T=10 K.
The best results in those experiments were obtained on micron-size flakes, on
which only two-terminal transport measurements could be performed. Here we pose
and solve the problem of extracting transport coefficients of a fractional
quantum Hall state from the two-terminal conductance. We develop a method,
based on the conformal invariance of two-dimensional magnetotransport, and
illustrate its use by analyzing the measurements on SG. From the temperature
dependence of longitudinal conductivity, extracted from the measured
two-terminal conductance, we estimate the energy gap of quasiparticle
excitations in the fractional-quantized nu=1/3 state. The gap is found to be
significantly larger than in GaAs-based structures, signaling much stronger
electron interactions in suspended graphene. Our approach provides a new tool
for the studies of quantum transport in suspended graphene and other nanoscale
systems.

taking place away from it. We find that a governing differential equation
developed from the Schroedinger equation leads to wave functions which turn out
to exhibit pronounced central localization. The extent of concentration of
probability depends on the mass; objects with small masses tend to behave in a
delocalized manner as ordinary quantum objects do in a static space, while
quantum objects with large masses have wave functions that are largely
concentrated into much smaller regions. This in turn suggests the possibility
that classical behavior is being induced in quantum objects by the presence of
the Hubble expansion. If the size of the localized region of concentrated
probability density is larger than the size of the corresponding extended
object, quantum behavior might be expected; whereas classical behavior might be
expected for cases in which the region of high probability density is smaller
than the size of the object. The resulting quantum-classical boundary due to
Hubble expansion may be expressed in terms of a relationship between the size
and mass of an object, or may be expressed in terms of a threshold moment of
inertia.

manner that is indistinguishable from that of massive, star-forming galaxies.
The close relationship between AGN activity and star formation is further
supported by an increase in the AGN fraction with bluer rest-frame colors

corrugated walls that confinement can be used to impose a controllable
mesoscopic superstructure of predominantly mechanical elastic character. Due to
an interplay of the particle density of the system and the width D of the
confining channel, ""soliton staircases"" can be created along both parallel
confining boundaries, that give rise to standing strain waves in the entire
crystal. The periodicity of these waves is of the same order as D. This
mechanism should be useful for structure formation in the self-assembly of
various nanoscopic materials.

microlensing. The planetary deviation was detected in real-time thanks to the
high cadence of the MOA survey, real-time light curve monitoring and intensive
follow-up observations. A Bayesian analysis returns the stellar mass and
distance at M_l = 0.64_{-0.26}^{+0.21} M_\sun and D_l = 5.9_{-1.4}^{+0.9} kpc,
respectively, so the mass and separation of the planet are M_p = 20_{-8}^{+7}

another cold Neptune-mass planet to the planetary sample discovered by
microlensing, which now comprise four cold Neptune/Super-Earths, five gas giant
planets, and another sub-Saturn mass planet whose nature is unclear. The
discovery of these ten cold exoplanets by the microlensing method implies that
the mass ratio function of cold exoplanets scales as dN_{\rm pl}/d\log q
\propto q^{-0.7 +/- 0.2} with a 95% confidence level upper limit of n < -0.35

current SF contributes more to the fractional growth of low-mass galaxies than
high-mass galaxies. However, we find a lower median SFR (by a factor of ~1.5)
in cluster star-forming galaxies than in the field. The difference is highly
significant when all Spitzer and emission-line galaxies are considered,
regardless of color. It remains significant at z>0.6 after removing red
emission-line (REL) galaxies, to avoid possible AGN contamination. While there
is overlap between the cluster and field SFR-Mass relations, we find a
population of cluster galaxies (10-25%) with reduced SFR for their mass. These
are likely to be in transition from star-forming to passive. Comparing
separately clusters and groups at z>0.6, only cluster trends are significantly

algorithms for several $\ell_1$-norm minimization problems arising from sparse
solution recovery in compressive sensing, including the basis pursuit problem,
the basis-pursuit denoising problems of both unconstrained and constrained
forms, as well as others. We present and investigate two classes of algorithms
derived from either the primal or the dual forms of the $\ell_1$-problems. The
construction of the algorithms consists of two main steps: (1) to reformulate
an $\ell_1$-problem into one having partially separable objective functions by
adding new variables and constraints; and (2) to apply an exact or inexact
alternating direction method to the resulting problem. The derived alternating
direction algorithms can be regarded as first-order primal-dual algorithms
because both primal and dual variables are updated at each and every iteration.
Convergence properties of these algorithms are established or restated when
they already exist. Extensive numerical results in comparison with several
state-of-the-art algorithms are given to demonstrate that the proposed
algorithms are efficient, stable and robust. Moreover, we present numerical
results to emphasize two practically important but perhaps overlooked points.
One point is that algorithm speed should always be evaluated relative to
appropriate solution accuracy; another is that whenever erroneous measurements
possibly exist, the $\ell_1$-norm fidelity should be the fidelity of choice in
compressive sensing.

of the Vega disk ""from the sources"". We assume that dust is maintained by a
""Kuiper belt"" of parent planetesimals at ~ 100 AU and employ our collisional
and radiative transfer codes to consistently model the size and radial
distribution of the disk material and then thermal emission of dust. In doing
so, we vary a broad set of parameters, including the stellar properties, the
exact location, extension, and dynamical excitation of the planetesimal belt,
chemical composition of solids, and the collisional prescription. We are able
to reproduce the spectral energy distribution in the entire wavelength range
from the near-infrared to millimeter, as well as the mid-IR and sub-millimeter
radial brightness profiles of the Vega disk. Thus our results suggest that the
Vega disk observations are compatible with a steady-state collisional dust
production, and we put important constraints on the disk parameters and
physical processes that sustain it. The total disk mass in < 100 km-sized
bodies is estimated to be ~ 10 Earth masses. Provided that collisional cascade
has been operating over much of the Vega age of ~ 350 Myr, the disk must have
lost a few Earth masses of solids during that time. We also demonstrate that
using an intermediate luminosity of the star between the pole and the equator,

remained a notoriously difficult problem even for classical systems due to the
exponentially suppressed (thermal) equilibration in the vicinity of such a
transition. In the absence of efficient update techniques, a common approach to
improve equilibration in Monte Carlo simulations is to broaden the sampled
statistical ensemble beyond the bimodal distribution of the canonical ensemble.
Here we show how a recently developed feedback algorithm can systematically
optimize such broad-histogram ensembles and significantly speed up
equilibration in comparison with other extended ensemble techniques such as
flat-histogram, multicanonical or Wang-Landau sampling. As a prototypical
example of a strong first-order transition we simulate the two-dimensional
Potts model with up to Q=250 different states on large systems. The optimized
histogram develops a distinct multipeak structure, thereby resolving entropic
barriers and their associated phase transitions in the phase coexistence region
such as droplet nucleation and annihilation or droplet-strip transitions for
systems with periodic boundary conditions. We characterize the efficiency of
the optimized histogram sampling by measuring round-trip times tau(N,Q) across
the phase transition for samples of size N spins. While we find power-law
scaling of tau vs. N for small Q \lesssim 50 and N \lesssim 40^2, we observe a
crossover to exponential scaling for larger Q. These results demonstrate that
despite the ensemble optimization broad-histogram simulations cannot fully
eliminate the supercritical slowing down at strongly first-order transitions.

clouds evolve slowly, many of them must be studied in detail to pick up

region, a core with interesting dust properties which have been evidenced with
the PRONAOS balloon-borne telescope. To trace the mass content of L1506C and
its kinematics, we mapped the dust emission, and the line emission of two key
species, C18O and N2H+ (plus 13CO and C17O). This cloud shows peculiar
features: i) a large envelope traced solely by 13CO holding a much smaller core
with a strong C18O depletion in its center despite a low maximum opacity (Av~20
mag), ii) extremely narrow C18O lines indicating a low, non-measurable
turbulence, iii) contraction traced by C18O itself (plus rotation), iv)
unexpectedly, the kinematical signature from the external envelope is opposite
to the core one: the 13CO and C18O velocity gradients have opposite directions
and opposite profiles (C18O blue peaked, 13CO red peaked). The core is large (r
= 3E4 AU) and not very dense (n(H2) ? 5E4 cm-3 or less). This core is therefore
not prestellar yet. All these facts suggest that the core is kinematically
detached from its envelope and in the process of forming a prestellar core.
This is the first time that the dynamical formation of a prestellar core is
witnessed. The extremely low turbulence could be the reason for the strong
depletion of this core despite its relatively low density and opacity in
contrast with undepleted cores such as L1521E which shows a turbulence at least
4 times as high.

Coulomb blockade we introduce a general response theory that probes the
sensitivity of SET to changes in the boundary conditions. This response theory
defines a new set of physical observables and we establish the contact with the
standard results obtained from ordinary linear response theory. The response
parameters generally define the renormalization behavior of the SET in the
entire regime from weak coupling with large values of the tunneling conductance
all the way down to the strong coupling phase where the system displays the
Coulomb blockade. We introduce a general criterion for charge quantization that
is analogous to the Thouless criterion for Anderson localization. We present
the results of detailed computations on the weak coupling side of the theory,
i.e. both perturbative and non-perturbative (instantons). Based on an effective
theory in terms of quantum spins we study the quantum critical behavior of the
AES model on the strong coupling side. Consequently, a unifying scaling diagram
of the SET is obtained. This diagram displays all the super universal

there is no offset between the stars and gas to within our error bars. We also
compare our simulations with recent observational analysis of M51. We compute
the pattern speed versus radius, and like the observations, find no single

considerable structure in the form of short-lived kinks and bifurcations.

fixed pattern speeds, it is more realistic to start from a picture in which the

constrain a decaying-dark-matter origin for the 1--100 GeV Galactic positron
anomaly measured with PAMELA. Inverse-Compton scattering of the microwave
background by the emergent positrons produces a bump in the diffuse 100-200 MeV
gamma-ray background that would protrude from the observed background at these
energies. The positrons are thus constrained to emerge from the decay process
at a typical energy between ~100 GeV and ~250 GeV. By considering only
gamma-ray emission of the excess positrons and electrons, we derive a minimum
diffuse gamma-ray flux that, apart from the positron spectrum assumed, is
independent of the actual decay modes. Any gamma-rays produced directly by the
dark-matter decay leads to an additional signal that make the observational
limits more severe. A similar constraint on the energy of emergent positrons
from annihilation in dark-matter substructures is argued to exist, according to
recent estimates of enhancement in low-mass dark-matter substructures, and
improved simulations of such substructure will further sharpen this constraint.

error is supposed to be independent of $X$. The objective of this work was to
construct a fully data-driven estimation procedure when the error density
$\varphi$ is unknown. We assume that in addition to the i.i.d. sample from $Y$,
we have at our disposal an additional i.i.d. sample drawn independently from
the error distribution. We first develop a minimax theory in terms of both
sample sizes. We propose an orthogonal series estimator attaining the minimax
rates but requiring optimal choice of a dimension parameter depending on
certain characteristics of $f$ and $\varphi$, which are not known in practice.
The main issue addressed in this work is the adaptive choice of this dimension
parameter using a model selection approach. In a first step, we develop a
penalized minimum contrast estimator assuming that the error density is known.
We show that this partially adaptive estimator can attain the lower risk bound
up to a constant in both sample sizes $n$ and $m$. Finally, by randomizing the
penalty and the collection of models, we modify the estimator such that it no
longer requires any previous knowledge of the error distribution. Even when
dispensing with any hypotheses on $\varphi$, this fully data-driven estimator
still preserves minimax optimality in almost the same cases as the partially
adaptive estimator. We illustrate our results by computing minimal rates under
classical smoothness assumptions.

cycle space of $G$ such that the total weight of the cycles in this basis is
minimized. If $G$ is a planar graph with non-negative edge weights, such a
basis can be found in $O(n^2)$ time and space, where $n$ is the size of $G$. We
show that this is optimal if an explicit representation of the basis is
required. We then present an $O(n^{3/2}\log n)$ time and $O(n^{3/2})$ space
algorithm that computes a minimum cycle basis \emph{implicitly}. From this
result, we obtain an output-sensitive algorithm that explicitly computes a
minimum cycle basis in $O(n^{3/2}\log n + C)$ time and $O(n^{3/2} + C)$ space,
where $C$ is the total size (number of edges and vertices) of the cycles in the

respectively, when $G$ is unweighted. We get similar results for the all-pairs
min cut problem since it is dual equivalent to the minimum cycle basis problem

space algorithms for finding, respectively, the weight vector and a Gomory-Hu
tree of $G$. The previous best time and space bound for these two problems was
quadratic. From our Gomory-Hu tree algorithm, we obtain the following result:
with $O(n^{3/2}\log n)$ time and $O(n^{3/2})$ space for preprocessing, the
weight of a min cut between any two given vertices of $G$ can be reported in
constant time. Previously, such an oracle required quadratic time and space for
preprocessing. The oracle can also be extended to report the actual cut in time
proportional to its size.

Using Post Newtonian (PN) accurate equations that include 2.5PN accurate
non-spinning contributions, the leading order general relativistic and
classical spin-orbit terms, the orbit of the binary black hole in OJ287 is
calculated and as expected it depends on the spin of the primary black hole.
Using the orbital solution, the specific times when the orbit of the secondary
crosses the accretion disk of the primary are evaluated such that the record of
observed outbursts from 1913 up to 2007 is reproduced. The timings of the
outbursts are quite sensitive to the spin value. In order to reproduce all the
known outbursts, including a newly discovered one in 1957, the Kerr parameter
of the primary has to be $0.28 \pm 0.08$. The quadrupole-moment contributions
to the equations of motion allow us to constrain the `no-hair' parameter to be
$1.0\:\pm\:0.3$ where 0.3 is the one sigma error. This supports the `black hole
no-hair theorem' within the achievable precision.
  It should be possible to test the present estimate in 2015 when the next
outburst is due. The timing of the 2015 outburst is a strong function of the
spin: if the spin is 0.36 of the maximal value allowed in general relativity,
the outburst begins in early November 2015, while the same event starts in the

uncertainty in the analysis of dense stellar fields observed with adaptive
optics. Program packages have been developed for a spatially variable PSF, but
they require that a sufficient number of bright, isolated stars in the image
are present to adequately sample the PSF. Imaging the Galactic center is
particularly challenging. We present two ways of dealing with spatially
variable PSFs when only one or very few suitable PSF reference stars are
present in the field. Local PSF fitting with the StarFinder algorithm is
applied to the data. Satisfying results can be found in two ways: (a) creating
local PSFs by merging locally extracted PSF cores with the PSF wings estimated
from the brightest star in the field; (b) Wiener deconvolution of the image
with the PSF estimated from the brightest star in the field and subsequent
estimation of local PSFs on the deconvolved image. The methodology is tested on
real, and on artificial images. The method involving Wiener deconvolution of
the image prior to local PSF extraction and fitting gives excellent results. It
limits systematic effects to ~2-5% in point source photometry and ~10% in
diffuse emission on fields-of-view as large as 28"" x 28"" and observed through
the H-band filter. Particular attention is given to how deconvolution changes
the noise properties of the image. It is shown that mean positions and fluxes
of the stars are conserved by the deconvolution. However, the estimated
uncertainties of the PSF fitting algorithm are too small if the presence of
covariances is ignored in the PSF fitting as has been done here. An appropriate
scaling factor can, however, be determined from simulated images or by
comparing measurements on independent data sets.

the effectiveness in producing a collimated magnetically powered outflow
depends on the rotation rate, the strength and the geometry of the field. The
flows produced by uniformly rotating, non-axisymmetric fields are found to
consist mainly of buoyant plumes heated by dissipation of rotational energy.
Collimated magnetically powered flows are formed if the field and the rotating
surface are arranged such that a toroidal magnetic field is produced. This
requires a differential rotation of the arcades' footpoints. Such jets are
well-collimated; we follow their propagation through the stratified atmosphere
over 100 times the source size. The magnetic field is tightly wound and its
propagation is dominated by the development of non-axisymmetric instabilities.
We observe a Poynting flux conversion efficiency of over 75% in the longest

now a common observation with the Hinode satellite. While there is
observational evidence to suggest that the outflows are originating in the
magnetic field surrounding the active regions, there is no conclusive evidence
that reveals how they are driven. Motivated by observations of outflows at the
periphery of a mature active region embedded in a coronal hole, we have used a
three-dimensional simulation to emulate the active region's development in
order to investigate the origin and driver of these outflows. We find outflows
are accelerated from a site in the coronal hole magnetic field immediately
surrounding the active region and are channelled along the coronal hole field
as they rise through the atmosphere. The plasma is accelerated simply as a
result of the active region expanding horizontally as it develops. Many of the
characteristics of the outflows generated in the simulation are consistent with
those of observed outflows: velocities up to 45 km per sec, properties akin to
the coronal hole, proximity to the active region's draining loops, expansion
with height, and projection over monopolar photospheric magnetic
concentrations. Although the horizontal expansion occurs as a consequence of
the active region's development in the simulation, expansion is also a general
feature of established active regions. Hence, it is entirely possible and
plausible that the expansion acceleration mechanism displayed in the simulation
is occurring in active regions on the Sun and, in addition to reconnection, is
driving the outflows observed at their edges.

general treatment of the recovery and loss of immunity terms. We present
oscillation diagrams (amplitude and period) in terms of the parameters of the

previous investigations of these magneto-intersubband (MIS) oscillations in
two-subband systems, we report on both experimental and theoretical studies of

show that the presence of more than two subbands leads to a qualitatively

magnetoresistance of triple-well systems exhibits an interference of MIS
oscillations and microwaveinduced resistance oscillations. The theory
explaining these phenomena is presented in the general form, valid for an

near-infrared broadband filters, to determine the power-law index of the
extinction-law toward the central parsec of the Galaxy, to provide measurements
of the absolute extinction toward the Galactic center, and finally to measure
the spatial variability of extinction on arcsecond scales.We use adaptive
optics observations of the central parsec of the Milky Way. Absolute values for
the extinction in the H, Ks, and L'-bands as well as of the power-law indices
of the H to Ks and Ks to L' extinction-laws are measured based on the
well-known properties of red clump stars. Extinction maps are derived based on
H-Ks and Ks-L' colors. We present Ks-band photometry for ~7700 stars (H and L'
photometry for a subset). From a number of recently published values we compute
a mean distance of the Galactic center of R_0=8.03+-0.15 kpc, which has an
uncertainty of just 2%. Based on this R_0 and on the RC method, we derive
absolute mean extinction values toward the central parsec of the Galaxy of
A_H=4.48+-0.13 mag, A_Ks=2.54+-0.12$ mag, and A_L'=1.27+-0.18 mag. We estimate
values of the power-law indices of the extinction-law of
alpha_{H-Ks}=2.21+-0.24 and alpha_{Ks-L'}=1.34+-0.29. A Ks-band extinction map
for the Galactic center is computed based on this extinction law and on stellar
H-Ks colors. Mean extinction values in a circular region with 0.5"" radius
centered on Sagittarius A* are A_{H, SgrA*}=4.35+-0.12, A_{Ks,
SgrA*}=2.46+-0.03, and A_{L', SgrA*}=1.23+-0.08.

be computed with the Wilson loop technique. This potential, dominated by a
linear potential at moderate distances, is consistent with the confinement with
a flux tube, an extended and scalar system also directly observable in lattice
QCD. Quantized flux tubes have also been observed in another class of
confinement, the magnetic confinement in type II superconductors. On the other
hand the solution of Schwinger Dyson Equations, say with the Landau gauge
fixing and the truncation of the series of Feynman diagrams, already at the
rainbow level for the self energy and at the ladder level for the Bethe
Salpeter equation, provides a signal of a possible inverse quartic potential in
momentum space derived from one gluon and one ghost exchange, consistent with
confinement. Here we address the successes, difficulties and open problems of
the matching of these two different perspectives of confinement, the
Schwinger-Dyson perspective versus the flux tube perspective.

consisted of identical particles should maintain unchanged under interchanging
between two of the particles. The whole wavefunction should be symmetrized or
antisymmetrized. This leads to statistical correlations between particles,
which exhibit observable effects. We design an experiment to directly observe
such effects for bosons. The experiment is performed with two photons. The
effect of statistical correlations is clearly observed when the wavepackets of
two photons are completely overlapped, and this effect varies with the degree
of overlapping. The results of our experiment substantiate the statistical
correlation in a simple way. Experiment reported here can also be regarded as
another kind of two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, occurs in the
polarization degree of freedom of photon.

regime of fast rotation, the Coriolis force dominates the dynamics and acts as
a restoring force for acoustic-drift waves along the condensate. We derive a
nonlinear equation that includes the effects of both the zero-point pressure
and the anharmonicity of the trap. It is shown that such waves have negative
phase speed, propagating in the opposite sense of the rotation. We discuss
different equilibrium configurations and compare with those resulting from the

background subtraction. In high-density oligonucleotide arrays this is
recognized as a crucial step for the global performance of the data analysis
from raw intensities to expression values.
  We propose here an algorithm for background estimation based on a model in
which the cost function is quadratic in a set of fitting parameters such that
minimization can be performed through linear algebra. The model incorporates
two effects: 1) Correlated intensities between neighboring features in the chip
and 2) sequence-dependent affinities for non-specific hybridization fitted by
an extended nearest-neighbor model.
  The algorithm has been tested on 360 GeneChips from publicly available data
of recent expression experiments. The algorithm is fast and accurate. Strong
correlations between the fitted values for different experiments as well as
between the free-energy parameters and their counterparts in aqueous solution
indicate that the model captures a significant part of the underlying physical
chemistry.

number of sites with open and directed boundary conditions. Its partition
function was calculated by Blythe, Evans, Colaiori, and Essler. It is known to
be a generating function of permutation tableaux by the combinatorial
interpretation of Corteel and Williams.
  We prove bijectively two new combinatorial interpretations. The first one is
in terms of weighted Motzkin paths called Laguerre histories and is obtained by
refining a bijection of Foata and Zeilberger. Secondly we show that this
partition function is the generating function of permutations with respect to
right-to-left minima, right-to-left maxima, ascents, and 31-2 patterns, by
refining a bijection of Francon and Viennot.
  Then we give a new formula for the partition function which generalizes the
one of Blythe & al. It is proved in two combinatorial ways. The first proof is
an enumeration of lattice paths which are known to be a solution of the Matrix
Ansatz of Derrida & al. The second proof relies on a previous enumeration of
rook placements, which appear in the combinatorial interpretation of a related
normal ordering problem. We also obtain a closed formula for the moments of
Al-Salam-Chihara polynomials.

carry through the computations for thick locally finite affine buildings of
type $\tilde{A}_2$ to prove a local limit theorem for these buildings. The
technique centres around the representation theory of the associated Hecke
