constructed based on a submatrix of a given check matrix. In the proposed
method, the syndrome-subsequence computed using the remaining submatrix is
utilized as auxiliary information for decoding. Then the ML error path is
correctly decoded using the degenerate error trellis. We also show that the
decoding complexity of the proposed method is basically identical with that of
the conventional one based on the original error trellis. Next, we apply the
method to check matrices with monomial entries proposed by Tanner et al. By
choosing any row of the check matrix as the submatrix for error-trellis
construction, a 1-state error trellis is obtained. Noting the fact that a
likelihood-concentration on the all-zero state and the states with many 0's
occurs in the error trellis, we present a simplified decoding method based on a
1-state error trellis, from which decoding-complexity reduction is realized.

incompressibility of neutron-rich matter. After much confusion on the
interpretation of the experimental data, consistency was finally reached
between different models that predicted both the distribution of isoscalar
monopole strength in finite nuclei and the compression modulus of infinite
matter. However, a very recent experiment on the Tin isotopes at the Research
Center for Nuclear Physics(RCNP) in Japan has again muddled the waters.
Self-consistent models that were successful in reproducing the energy of the
giant monopole resonance (GMR) in nuclei with various nucleon asymmetries (such
as 90Zr, 144Sm, and 208Pb) overestimate the GMR energies in the Tin isotopes.
As important, the discrepancy between theory and experiment appears to grow
with neutron excess. This is particularly problematic as models artificially
tuned to reproduce the rapid softening of the GMR in the Tin isotopes become
inconsistent with the behavior of dilute neutron matter. Thus, we regard the
question of ``why is Tin so soft?'' as an important open problem in nuclear
structure.

parametrization is based on vector meson dominance and a derivative expansion
of nucleon couplings to the electromagnetic fields. At lowest order in the

fit the form factors to within a few percent up to momentum transfers of 600

disjoint discs of radius $1/L$ inside the unit disc. By using linear maps of
smaller disc onto the unit disc we can generate a self-similar Cantor set $G$.
Then $\G=\bigcap_n\G_n$. One may then ask the rate at which the Favard length -
the average over all directions of the length of the orthogonal projection onto
a line in that direction - of these sets $\G_n$ decays to zero as a function of
$n$. The quantitative results for the Favard length problem were obtained by
Peres-Solomyak and Tao; in the latter paper a general way of making a
quantitative statement from the Besicovitch theorem is considered. But being
rather general, this method does not give a good estimate for self-similar
structures such as $\G_n$. Indeed, vastly improved estimates have been proven
in these cases: in the paper of Nazarov-Peres-Volberg, it was shown that for
1/4 corner Cantor set one has $p<1/6$, such that
$Fav(\K_n)\leq\frac{c_p}{n^{p}}$, and in Laba-Zhai and Bond-Volberg the same

tiling property) and for the Sierpinski gasket $S_n$ for some other $p>0$. In
the present work we give an estimate that works for {\it any} Besicovitch set

estimate still appears to be related to a certain regularity property of zeros
of a corresponding linear combination of exponents (we call this property {\it
analytic tiling}).

chemical processes on the atomic and molecular scale. This work presents a
perspective of progress in the field of control over quantum phenomena, tracing
the evolution of theoretical concepts and experimental methods from early
developments to the most recent advances. The current experimental successes
would be impossible without the development of intense femtosecond laser
sources and pulse shapers. The two most critical theoretical insights were (1)
realizing that ultrafast atomic and molecular dynamics can be controlled via
manipulation of quantum interferences and (2) understanding that optimally
shaped ultrafast laser pulses are the most effective means for producing the
desired quantum interference patterns in the controlled system. Finally, these
theoretical and experimental advances were brought together by the crucial
concept of adaptive feedback control, which is a laboratory procedure employing
measurement-driven, closed-loop optimization to identify the best shapes of
femtosecond laser control pulses for steering quantum dynamics towards the
desired objective. Optimization in adaptive feedback control experiments is
guided by a learning algorithm, with stochastic methods proving to be
especially effective. Adaptive feedback control of quantum phenomena has found
numerous applications in many areas of the physical and chemical sciences, and
this paper reviews the extensive experiments. Other subjects discussed include
quantum optimal control theory, quantum control landscapes, the role of
theoretical control designs in experimental realizations, and real-time quantum
feedback control. The paper concludes with a prospective of open research
directions that are likely to attract significant attention in the future.

identical to the field-driven motion and thus, belongs to the same universality
class despite their qualitative differences. Moreover all DW motions driven by

the unification of the two driving mechanisms. The unified law manifests
non-vanishing current efficiency at low current densities down to the practical

correlation method, the same resistor is connected to two amplifiers and a

systematic error in the JNT reading. In order to put an upper limit, or to
achieve a correction, for such error, a careful electrical modelling of the
amplifiers and connections must be performed. Standard numerical simulation
tools are inadequate for such modelling. In literature, evaluations have been
performed by the painstaking solving of analytical modelling. We propose an
evaluation procedure for the JNT error due to residual correlations which
blends analytical and numerical approaches, with the benefits of both: a
rigorous and accurate circuit noise modelling, and a fast and flexible

this quantum phase lasts 10^{7-8} e-foldings. A long period of fluctuation
driven growth of the inflation field can possibly take the inflaton past phi_*,
the value of the field where our current horizon scale crosses the horizon;
alternatively, even if the field does not cross phi_*, the inflaton could have
high kinetic energy at the end of this phase. Therefore we study these issues
in the context of different models of inflation. In scenarios where
cosmological relevant scales leave during the quantum phase we obtain large
curvature perturbations of O(10). We also apply our results to quadratic
curvaton models and to quintessence models. In curvaton models we find that
inflation must last longer than required to solve the horizon problem, that the
curvaton models are incompatible with small field inflation models and that
there may be too large non-gaussianity. A new phase of thermal fluctuation

quantum computation, which is based on the cluster model of encoded qubits. In
this cluster-based architecture, concatenated computation is implemented in a
quite different way from the usual circuit-based architecture where physical
gates are recursively replaced by logical gates with error-correction gadgets.
Instead, some relevant cluster states, say fundamental clusters, are
recursively constructed through verification and postselection in advance for
the higher-level one-way computation, which namely provides error-precorrection
of gate operations. A suitable code such as the Steane seven-qubit code is
adopted for transversal operations. This concatenated construction of verified
fundamental clusters has a simple transversal structure of logical errors, and
achieves a high noise threshold ~ 3 % for computation by using appropriate
verification procedures. Since the postselection is localized within each
fundamental cluster with the help of deterministic bare controlled-Z gates
without verification, divergence of resources is restrained, which reconciles
postselection with scalability.

  For the random motions having an explicit density law, further interesting
probabilistic interpretations emerge if we deal with them varying up a random
time. Essentially, we consider two different type of random times, namely
Bessel and Gamma times, which contain, as particular cases, some important
probability distributions (e.g. Gaussian, Exponential). In particular, for the

opportunity to explore the innermost regions of supermassive black hole
accretion discs. Our goal in this paper is to investigate the central
environment of a Seyfert 1.5 galaxy IRAS 05078+1626. We studied the
time-averaged spectrum obtained with the EPIC and RGS instruments. A power-law
continuum (photon index ~ 1.75) dominates the 2-10 keV energy range. A narrow
iron K alpha spectral line is clearly seen, presumably originating in a distant
torus, but no broad relativistic component was detected. However, the power law
and the iron K alpha line alone do not provide a satisfactory fit in the soft
X-ray band whose spectrum can be explained by the combination of three
components: a) a cold photoelectric absorber with column density ~ 10^(21)
cm^(-2). This gas could be located either in outer parts of the accretion disc,
at the rim of the torus or farther out in the host galaxy; b) a warm absorber
with high ionization parameter (log(xi) ~ 2.2) and column density ~ 10^(24)
cm^(-2); c) an ionized reflection where the reflecting gas could be either in
the inner wall of a warm absorber cone or in an ionized accretion disc. The
first X-ray spectroscopic measurement of IRAS05078+1626 unveils some of the
standard ingredients in Seyfert galaxies, such as a power-law primary
continuum, modified by reflection from the accretion disc and by the effect of
complex, multi-phase obscuration. However, data constrains the accretion disc,
if present, not to extend closer than to 60 gravitational radii from the black
hole.

networks if their nodes possess individual inter-related biologically inspired
genetic codes. The work takes ideas from natural immune systems protecting
organisms from infection. Nodes in the present proposal have individual gene
sets fitting into a self organised phylogenetic tree. Members of this
population are genetically ''relatives''. Outsiders cannot easily copy or
introduce a new node in the network without going through a process of
conception between two nodes in the population. Related nodes can locally
decide to check each other for their genetic relation without directly
revealing their gene sets. A copy/clone of a gene sequence or a random gene set
will appear as alien. Nodes go through a cycle of introduction (conception or
''birth'') with parents in the network and later exit from it (''death'').
Hence the phylogenetic tree is dynamic or possesses a genetic drift. Typical
lifetimes of gene sets and number of offspring from different parents affect
this genetic drift and the level of correlation between gene sets. The
frequency of mutations similarly affects the gene pool. Correlation between
genes of the nodes implies a common secret for cryptographic material for
communication and consistency check facilitating intrusion detection and
tracing of events. A node can by itself (non-specifically) recognise an
adversary if it does not respond properly according to its genes. Nodes can
also collaborate to recognise adversaries by communicating response from
intruders to check for consistency with the whole gene pool (phylogenetic
tree).

Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies toward the position of CrB-H, a very deep and
extended decrement in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), located within the
Corona Borealis supercluster (CrB-SC). It was found in a survey with the Very
Small Array (VSA) interferometer at 33 GHz, with a peak negative brightness
temperature of -230 muK, and deviates 4.4-sigma from the Gaussian CMB
(G\'enova-Santos et al.). Observations with the Millimeter and Infrared Testa
Grigia Observatory (MITO) suggested that 25$^+21_-18% of this decrement may be
caused by the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect (Battistelli et al.).
Here we investigate whether the galaxy distribution could be tracing either a
previously unnoticed galaxy cluster or a Warm/Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM)
filament that could build up this tSZ effect.
  We find that the projected density of galaxies outside Abell clusters and
with redshifts 0.05<z<0.12 at the position of CrB-H is the highest in the area
encompassed by the CrB-SC. Most of these galaxies are located around redshifts
z=0.07 and z=0.11, but no clear connection in the form of a filamentary
structure is appreciable in between. While the galaxy distribution at z=0.07 is
sparse, we find evidence at z=0.11 of a galaxy group or a low-mass galaxy
cluster. We estimate that this structure could produce a tSZ effect of ~ -18
muK. The remaining VSA signal of ~ -212 muK is still a significant 4.1-sigma
deviation from the Gaussian CMB. However, the MITO error bar allows for a
larger tSZ effect, which could be produced by galaxy clusters or superclusters
beyond the sensitivity of the SDSS. Contributions from other possible secondary
anisotropies associated with these structures are also discussed.

physics literature by Amit, Parisi and Peliti in [Amit-Parisi-Peliti (1983)].
In both cases, a random motion in space is pushed towards domains less visited
in the past by a kind of negative gradient of the occupation time measure.
  We investigate the asymptotic behaviour of SRBP in the non-recurrent
dimensions. First, extending 1-dimensional results from [Tarres-Toth-Valko
(2009)], we identify a natural stationary (in time) and ergodic distribution of
the environment (essentially, smeared-out occupation time measure of the
process), as seen from the moving particle. As main result we prove that in
three and more dimensions, in this stationary (and ergodic) regime, the
displacement of the moving particle scales diffusively and its finite
dimensional distributions converge to those of a Wiener process. This result
settles part of the conjectures (based on non-rigorous renormalization group
arguments) in [Amit-Parisi-Peliti (1983)].
  The main tool is the non-reversible version of the Kipnis--Varadhan-type CLT

with the data. Our results suggest that antibody diversity is not limited by
the sequences encoded in the genome, and may reflect rapid adaptation to
antigenic challenges. This approach should be applicable to the study of the
global properties of other protein families.

spatially-resolved X-ray spectral analysis of the ""oxygen-rich"" supernova
remnant (SNR) 0540-69.3 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. We conclusively
establish the nonthermal nature of the ""arcs"" in the east and west boundaries
of the SNR, which confirms the cosmic-ray electron acceleration in the
supernova shock (B ~ 20-140 microG). We report tentative evidence for Fe
overabundance in the southern region close to the outer boundary of the SNR.
While such a detection would be intriguing, the existence of Fe ejecta is not
conclusive with the current data because of poor photon statistics and limited
plasma models. If it is verified using deeper X-ray observations and improved
plasma models, the presence of Fe ejecta, which was produced in the core of the
supernova, near the SNR's outer boundary would provide an intriguing
opportunity to study the explosive nucleosynthesis and the ejecta mixing in
this young core-collapse SNR. There is no evidence of X-ray counterparts for
the optical O-rich ejecta in the central regions of the SNR.

rock-paper-scissors games with mutations. In the mean-field limit, different
behaviors are found: (a) for high mutation rate, there is a stable interior
fixed point with coexistence of all species; (b) for low mutation rates, there
is a region of the parameter space characterized by a limit cycle resulting
from a Hopf bifurcation; (c) in the absence of mutations, there is a region
where heteroclinic cycles yield oscillations of large amplitude (not robust
against noise). After a discussion on the main properties of the mean-field
dynamics, we investigate the stochastic version of the model within an
individual-based formulation. Demographic fluctuations are therefore naturally
accounted and their effects are studied using a diffusion theory complemented
by numerical simulations. It is thus shown that persistent erratic oscillations
(quasi-cycles) of large amplitude emerge from a noise-induced resonance
phenomenon. We also analytically and numerically compute the average escape
time necessary to reach a (quasi-)cycle on which the system oscillates at a
given amplitude.

Schwarzschild solution have only mass parameter. So does its linear
approximation. On the other hand the solutions of linearized Einstein
equations, obtained using graviton propagator, contain mass and its pressure

theoretically investigate phonon-assisted transitions from the exciton to a
cavity photon, where the energy mismatch is compensated by phonon emission or
absorption. By means of a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation we derive an
effective Hamiltonian, which describes the combined effect of exciton-cavity
and exciton-phonon coupling, and compute the scattering rates within a Fermi
golden rule approach. The results of this approach are compared with those of a
recently reported description scheme based on the independent Boson model [U.
Hohenester et al., Phys. Rev. B 80, 201311(R) (2009)], and a numerical density
matrix approach. All description schemes are shown to give very similar
results. We present results for the spontaneous emission lifetime of a quantum
dot initially populated with a single exciton or biexciton, and for the
spectral properties of an optically driven dot-cavity system operating in the
strong coupling regime. Our results demonstrate that phonon-assisted feeding
plays a dominant role for strongly coupled dot-cavity systems, when the
detuning is of the order of a few millielectron volts.

may play an important role in the heating and acceleration of the fast solar
wind. Although such interactions have been studied extensively for ""parallel""
waves, whose wave vectors ${\bf k}$ are aligned with the background magnetic
field ${\bf B}_0$, much less is known about interactions between ions and
oblique A/IC waves, for which the angle $\theta$ between ${\bf k}$ and ${\bf
B}_0$ is nonzero. In this paper, we present new numerical results on resonant
cyclotron interactions between protons and oblique A/IC waves in collisionless
low-beta plasmas such as the solar corona. We find that if some mechanism
generates oblique high-frequency A/IC waves, then these waves initially modify
the proton distribution function in such a way that it becomes unstable to
parallel waves. Parallel waves are then amplified to the point that they
dominate the wave energy at the large parallel wave numbers at which the waves
resonate with the particles. Pitch-angle scattering by these waves then causes
the plasma to evolve towards a state in which the proton distribution is
constant along a particular set of nested ""scattering surfaces"" in velocity
space, whose shapes have been calculated previously. As the distribution
function approaches this state, the imaginary part of the frequency of parallel
A/IC waves drops continuously towards zero, but oblique waves continue to
undergo cyclotron damping while simultaneously causing protons to diffuse
across these kinetic shells to higher energies. We conclude that oblique A/IC
waves can be more effective at heating protons than parallel A/IC waves,
because for oblique waves the plasma does not relax towards a state in which
proton damping of oblique A/IC waves ceases.
