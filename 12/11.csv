astronomy (Stanek 2008), some colleagues expressed an interest in knowing if
any correlation exists between citations and the number of authors on an
astronomical paper. At least naively, one would expect papers with more authors
to be cited more. I test this expectation with the same sample of papers as
analyzed in Stanek (2008), selecting all (~30,000) refereed papers from A&A,
AJ, ApJ and MNRAS published between 2000 and 2004. (...) I find that indeed
papers with more authors are on average cited more, but only weakly so:
roughly, the number of citations doubles with ten-fold increase in the number
of authors. While the median number of citations to a 2 author paper is 17, the
median number of citations to a paper with 10 to 20 authors is 32. I find that
most of the papers are written by a small number of authors, with a mode of 2
authors and a median of 3 authors. I also find that papers with more authors
are not longer than papers with fewer authors, in fact a median number of 8 to
10 pages per paper holds for any number of authors. For the same sample of
papers, a median number of citations per paper grew from 15 in June 2008
(Stanek 2008) to 19 in November 2009. Unlike Stanek (2008), I do not conclude
with any career advice, semi-humorous or otherwise.

the star formation rate (SFR) surface density, Sigma_SFR, and the gas density
Sigma_gas (molecular, atomic, and total). We also explore whether there are
other physical quantities, such as the hydrostatic pressure and dust optical
depth, which establish a good correlation with Sigma_SFR. We use the Ha,
far-ultraviolet (FUV), and bolometric emission maps to infer the SFR locally at
different spatial scales, and in radial bins using azimuthally averaged values.
Most of the local analysis is done using the highest spatial resolution allowed
by gas surveys, 180 pc. The Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) law, Sigma_SFR \propto
(Sigma_gas)^n is analyzed by three statistical methods. At all spatial scales,
with Ha emission as a SFR tracer, the KS indices n are always steeper than
those derived with the FUV and bolometric emissions. We attribute this to the
lack of Ha emission in low luminosity regions where most stars form in small
clusters with an incomplete initial mass function at their high mass end. For
azimuthally averaged values the depletion timescale for the molecular gas is
constant, and the KS index is n_H2 = 1.1 +- 0.1. Locally, at a spatial
resolution of 180 pc, the correlation between Sigma_SFR and Sigma_gas is
generally poor, even though it is tighter with the molecular and total gas than
with the atomic gas alone. Considering only positions where the CO J=1-0 line
is above the 2-sigma detection threshold and taking into account uncertainties
in Sigma_H2 and Sigma_SFR, we obtain a steeper KS index than obtained with
radial averages: n_H2 = 2.22 +- 0.07 (for FUV and bolometric SFR tracers),
flatter than that relative to the total gas (n_Htot = 2.59 +- 0.05). [abridged]

physical constraints on achievable time delays, with emphasis on pure dephasing
of excitonic qubits in quantum dots. Our analysis shows that little advantage
of high-level decoupling schemes based on concatenated or optimal design is to
be expected if operational constraints prevent pulses to be applied
sufficiently fast. In such constrained scenarios, we demonstrate how simple
modifications of repeated periodic echo protocols can offer significantly
improved coherence preservation in realistic parameter regimes.

spectral properties of the \gamma-ray selected blazars of the Fermi LAT Bright
AGN Sample (LBAS). By combining our accurately estimated Fermi gamma-ray
spectra with Swift, radio, infra-red, optical and other hard X-ray/gamma-ray
data, collected within three months of the LBAS data taking period, we were
able to assemble high-quality and quasi-simultaneous Spectral Energy
Distributions (SED) for 48 LBAS blazars.The SED of these gamma-ray sources is
similar to that of blazars discovered at other wavelengths, clearly showing, in
the usual Log $\nu $ - Log $\nu$ F$_\nu$ representation, the typical broad-band
spectral signatures normally attributed to a combination of low-energy
synchrotron radiation followed by inverse Compton emission of one or more
components. We have used these SEDs to characterize the peak intensity of both
the low and the high-energy components. The results have been used to derive
empirical relationships that estimate the position of the two peaks from the
broad-band colors (i.e. the radio to optical and optical to X-ray spectral
slopes) and from the gamma-ray spectral index. Our data show that the
synchrotron peak frequency $\nu_p^S$ is positioned between 10$^{12.5}$ and
10$^{14.5}$ Hz in broad-lined FSRQs and between $10^{13}$ and $10^{17}$ Hz in
featureless BL Lacertae objects.We find that the gamma-ray spectral slope is
strongly correlated with the synchrotron peak energy and with the X-ray
spectral index, as expected at first order in synchrotron - inverse Compton
scenarios. However, simple homogeneous, one-zone, Synchrotron Self Compton
(SSC) models cannot explain most of our SEDs, especially in the case of FSRQs
and low energy peaked (LBL) BL Lacs. (...)

existing models for the jet formation and excitation. The ratios and
luminosities of several important diagnostic lines have been used to derive
physical parameters. [FeII] and H2 Position Velocity Diagrams (PVDs) have been
in addition constructed to study the kinematics. Within 1000-2000 AU from the
source the atomic gas presents a wide range of radial velocities. Only the gas
component at the highest velocity (HVC) survives at large distances. The H2,
shows, close to the source, only a single velocity component at almost zero
velocity, while it reaches higer velocities further downstream. Electron
densities (ne) and mass ejection fluxes (Mjet) have been measured separately
for the HVC and LVC from the [FeII] lines. ne increases with decreasing
velocities, while the opposite occurs for Mjet. The mass flux carried out by
the molecular component, measured from the H2 lines flux, is ~4 10^-9 Msun/yr.
We have estimated that the Fe gas phase abundance is significantly lower than
the solar value, with ~88% of iron still depleted onto dust grains in the
internal jet region. The derived densities and mass flux values are typical of
Class I objects or very active TTauri stars. However, the spatial extent of the
LVC and the velocity dependence of the electron density have been so far
observed only in another Class I jet, the HH34 jet, and are not explained by
the current models of jet launching.

eccentric orbits, some if not all of which may have been produced through
planetary migration. During this process, any planets interior to such an orbit
would therefore have been susceptible to resonance capture, and hence may
exhibit measurable orbital period variations. Here we summarize the results of
our investigation into the possibility of detecting low-mass planets which have
been captured into the strong 2:1 resonance. Using analytical expressions
together with simulated data we showed that it is possible to identify the
existence of a low-mass companion in the internal 2:1 resonance by estimating
the time-dependant orbital period for piecewise sections of radial velocity
data. This works as long as the amplitude of modulation of the orbital period
is greater than its uncertainty, which in practice means that the system should
not be too close to exact resonance. Here we provide simple expressions for the
libration period and the change in the observed orbital period, these being
valid for arbitrary eccentricities and planet masses. They in turn allow one to
constrain the mass and eccentricity of a companion planet if the orbital period
is sufficiently modulated.

the circumbinary disk. Our calculations suggest that an electromagnetic
counterpart may become observable as a rapidly brightening source soon after
the merger, i.e. several years earlier than previously thought. The afterglow
can reach super-Eddington luminosities without violating the local Eddington
flux limit. It is emitted in the soft X-ray by the innermost circumbinary disk,
but it may be partially reprocessed at optical and infrared frequencies. We
also find that the spreading disk becomes increasingly geometrically thick
close to the central object as it evolves, indicating that the innermost flow
could become advective and radiatively inefficient, and generate a powerful
outflow. We conclude that the mergers of massive black holes detected by LISA
offer unique opportunities for monitoring on humanly tractable timescales the
viscous evolution of accretion flows and the emergence of outflows around
massive black holes with precisely known masses, spins and orientations.

  Ground-based photometry reveals that in the U vs. (U-B) color-magnitude

able to correlate with variations in Na and O abundances. In particular the
Na-rich, O-poor stars identified by Carretta et al. (2007) define a sequence on

extrasolar moons. Since 2004 gravitational microlensing has been successfully
applied as a detection method for extrasolar planets. In principle, the method
is sensitive to masses as low as an Earth mass or even a fraction of it. Hence
it seems natural to investigate the microlensing effects of moons around
extrasolar planets. We explore the simplest conceivable triple lens system,
containing one star, one planet and one moon. From a microlensing point of
view, this system can be modelled as a particular triple with hierarchical mass
ratios very different from unity. Since the moon orbits the planet, the
planet-moon separation will be small compared to the distance between planet
and star. Such a configuration can lead to a complex interference of caustics.
We present detectability and detection limits by comparing triple-lens light
curves to best-fit binary light curves as caused by a double-lens system
consisting of host star and planet -- without moon. We simulate magnification
patterns covering a range of mass and separation values using the inverse ray
shooting technique. These patterns are processed by analysing a large number of
light curves and fitting a binary case to each of them. A chi-squared criterion
is used to quantify the detectability of the moon in a number of selected
triple-lens scenarios. The results of our simulations indicate that it is
feasible to discover extrasolar moons via gravitational microlensing through
frequent and highly precise monitoring of anomalous Galactic microlensing
events with dwarf source stars.

using two-flavor heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory. Specifically we
compute chiral corrections to the charge radii, magnetic moments, and magnetic
radii of the spin one-half hyperons, as well as the charge radii, magnetic
moments, magnetic radii, electric quadrupole moments, and quadrupole radii of
the spin three-half hyperons. Results for the nucleon and delta are also
included. Efficacy of the two-flavor theory is investigated by analyzing the
role played by virtual kaons. For the electromagnetic properties of spin
one-half hyperons, kaon loop contributions are shown to be well described by
terms analytic in the pion mass squared. Similarly kaon contributions to the
magnetic moments of spin three-half hyperons are well described in the
two-flavor theory. The remaining electromagnetic properties of spin three-half
resonances can be described in two-flavor chiral perturbation theory, however,
this description fails just beyond the physical pion mass. For the case of
experimentally known hyperon magnetic moments and charge radii, we demonstrate
that chiral corrections are under reasonable control, in contrast to the
behavior of these observables in the three-flavor chiral expansion. The
formulae we derive are ideal for performing the pion mass extrapolation of
lattice QCD data obtained at the physical strange quark mass.

general relativistic, hydrodynamic simulations of merging, equal-mass,
nonspinning BHBH binaries embedded in gas clouds. We evolve the metric using
the BSSN formulation with standard moving puncture gauge conditions and handle
the hydrodynamics via a high-resolution shock-capturing (HRSC) scheme. We

to the ambient gas cloud, as well as ""binary Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion""

to be homogeneous far from the binary and governed by a \Gamma-law equation of
state. We vary \Gamma between 4/3 and 5/3. For each simulation, we compute the
gas flow and accretion rate and estimate the electromagnetic luminosity due to
bremsstrahlung and synchrotron emission. We find evidence for significant
enhancements in both the accretion rate and luminosity over values for a single
black hole of the same mass as the binary. We estimate that this luminosity
enhancement should be detectable by LSST for a 10^6 M_sun binary in a hot gas
cloud of density n~10/cm^3 and temperature T~10^6 K at z=1, reaching a maximum
of L~3x10^43 erg/s, with the emission peaking in the visible band.

requirements for achieving universal quantum computation (QC). For example,
one-way QC requires the preparation of an entangled ""cluster"" state followed by
adaptive measurement on this state, a set of requirements which is different
from the standard quantum circuit model. Here we introduce a model based on
one-way QC but without measurements (except for the final readout), instead
using adiabatic deformation of a Hamiltonian whose initial ground state is the
cluster state. This opens the possibility to use the copious results from
one-way QC to build more feasible adiabatic schemes.

measurement record that is obtained as a sequence of expectation values of a
Hermitian operator evolving under repeated application of a single random
unitary map, U_0. We show that while this single-parameter orbit in operator
space is not informationally complete, it can be used to yield surprisingly
high-fidelity reconstruction. For a d-dimensional Hilbert space with the
initial observable in su(d), the measurement record lacks information about a
matrix subspace of dimension > d-2 out of the total dimension d^2-1. We
determine the conditions on U_0 such that the bound is saturated, and show they
are achieved by almost all pseudorandom unitary matrices. When we further
impose the constraint that the physical density matrix must be positive, we
obtain even higher fidelity than that predicted from the missing subspace. With
prior knowledge that the state is pure, the reconstruction will be perfect (in
the limit of vanishing noise) and for arbitrary mixed states, the fidelity is
over 0.96, even for small d, and reaching F > 0.99 for d > 9. We also study the
implementation of this protocol based on the relationship between random
matrices and quantum chaos. We show that the Floquet operator of the quantum
kicked top provides a means of generating the required type of measurement
record, with implications on the relationship between quantum chaos and
information gain.

with aberrant neurogenesis, though the role of the network-level changes in
development of epilepsy is not well understood. In this paper, we use
computational simulations to investigate the effect of network environment on
structural and functional outcomes of neurogenesis. We find that small-world
networks with external stimulus are able to be augmented by activity-seeking
neurons in a manner that enhances activity at the stimulated sites without
altering the network as a whole. However, when inhibition is decreased or
connectivity patterns are changed, new cells are both less responsive to

motives over a noetherian scheme of finite dimension, extending Voevodsky's
definition of motives over a field. In particular, it is shown that motives
with rational coefficients satisfy the formalism of the six operations of

well as by comparing different presentations of these categories, following and
extending insights and constructions of Deligne, Beilinson, Bloch, Thomason,
Gabber, Levine, Morel, Voevodsky, Ayoub, Spitzweck, R\""ondigs, {\O}stv{\ae}r,
and others. In particular, the relation of motives with $K$-theory is addressed
in full, and we prove the absolute purity theorem with rational coefficients,
using Quillen's localization theorem in algebraic $K$-theory together with a
variation on the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem. Using resolution of
singularities via alterations of de Jong-Gabber, this leads to a version of
Grothendieck-Verdier duality for constructible motivic sheaves with rational
coefficients over rather general base schemes. We also study versions with
integral coefficients, constructed via sheaves with transfers, for which we
obtain partial results. Finally, we associate to any mixed Weil cohomology a
system of categories of coefficients and well behaved realization functors,
establishing a correspondence between mixed Weil cohomologies and suitable
systems of coefficients. The results of this book have already served as ground
reference in many subsequent works on motivic sheaves and their realizations,
and pointers to the most recent developments of the theory are given in the
introduction.

cluster system. The mean of the total sample of 107 metallicities is -1.06 +/-
0.07, higher than either M31 or the Milky Way. We suspect this high mean
metallicity is due to an overrepresentation of metal-rich clusters in our
sample created by the spatial limits of the HST I-band survey. The metallicity
distribution shows marginal evidence for bimodality, with metal-rich and
metal-poor peaks approximately matching those of M31 and the Milky Way. The GC
system as a whole, and the metal-poor GCs alone, show evidence of a radial
metallicity gradient. The M81 globular cluster system as a whole shows strong
evidence of rotation, with V_r(deprojected) = 108 +/- 22 km/s overall. This
result is likely biased toward high rotational velocity due to
overrepresentation of metal-rich, inner clusters. The rotation patterns among
globular cluster subpopulations are roughly similar to those of the Milky Way:
clusters at small projected radii and metal-rich clusters rotate strongly,
while clusters at large projected radii and metal-poor clusters show weaker

define a deformation of the entropy, called {\it scaling entropy}; this is also
a metric invariant of the measure preserving actions of the group, which is
more powerful than the ordinary entropy. To define it, we involve the notion of
the $\epsilon$-entropy of a metric in a measure space, also suggested by A. N.
Kolmogorov slightly earlier. We suggest to replace the techniques of measurable
partitions, conventional in entropy theory, by that of iterations of metrics or
semi-metrics. This leads us to the key idea of this paper which as we hope is
the answer on the old question: what is the natural context in which one should
consider the entropy of measure-preserving actions of groups? the same question
about its generalizations--scaling entropy, and more general problems of
ergodic theory.
  Namely, we propose a certain research program, called {\it asymptotic
dynamics of metrics in a measure space}, in which, for instance, the
generalized entropy is understood as {\it the asymptotic Hausdorff dimension of
a sequence of metric spaces associated with dynamical system.} As may be
supposed, the metric isomorphism problem for dynamical systems as a whole also
gets a new geometric interpretation.

formalism of the halo occupation distribution (HOD). The resulting parameter
constraints describe properties like gas richness verses environment.
Unfortunately, clustering studies based on individual HI galaxies will be
restricted to the local Universe for the foreseeable future, even with the
deepest HI surveys. Here we discuss how clustering studies of the HI HOD could
be extended to moderate redshift, through observations of fluctuations in the
combined 21cm intensity of unresolved galaxies. In particular we make an
analytic estimate for the clustering of HI in the HOD. Our joint goals are to
estimate i) the amplitude of the signal, and ii) the sensitivity of telescopes
like the Australian SKA Pathfinder to HOD parameters. We find that the power
spectrum of redshifted 21cm intensity could be used to study the distribution
of HI within dark matter halos at z>0.5 where individual galaxies cannot be
detected. In addition to the HOD of HI, the amplitude of the 21cm power
spectrum would also yield estimates of the cosmic HI content at epochs between
the local Universe, and redshifts probed by damped Ly-alpha absorbers.

are under debate. Here we improve constraints on the source population(s) and
compositions of UHECRs by accounting for UHECR deflections within existing
Galactic magnetic field models (GMFs). We used Monte Carlo simulations for
UHECRs detected by the Pierre Auger Observatory and AGASA in order to determine
their outside-the-Galaxy arrival directions, and compared these with Galactic
and extragalactic sources. The simulations, which used UHECR compositions from
protons to Iron and seven models of the ordered GMF, include uncertainties in
the GMF and a turbulent magnetic field. The correlation between UHECRs and
nearby extended radiogalaxies (Nagar & Matulich 2008) remains valid, even
strengthened, within several GMF models. Both the nearest radiogalaxy CenA, and
the nearest radio-extended BL Lac, CGCG 413-019, are likely sources of multiple
UHECRs. The correlation appears to be linked to the presence of the extended
radio source rather than a tracer of an underlying population. It is possible,
but unlikely, that all UHECRs originate in the nearby radiogalaxy CenA. For
light UHECRs about a third of UHECRs can be ""matched"" to nearby galaxies with
extended radio jets. The remaining UHECRs could also be explained as
originating in extended radiogalaxies if one has at least one of: a large UHECR
mean free path, a high cluster and/or intergalactic magnetic field, a heavy
composition for two-thirds of the detected UHECRs. Several UHECRs have
trajectories which pass close to Galactic magnetars and/or microquasars.
  If extended radiogalaxies are, or trace, UHECR sources, the most consistent
models for the ordered GMF are the BS-S and BS-A models; the GMF models of Sun
et al. 2008 are acceptable if a dipole component is added.

combine these measurements with the recently published Kepler secondary eclipse
measurement, and generate atmospheric models for the day-side of the planet
that are consistent with both the optical and infrared measurements. The data
are best fit by models with a temperature inversion, as expected from the high
incident flux. The models predict a low optical albedo of ~< 0.13, with
subsolar abundances of Na, K, TiO and VO. We also find that the best fitting
models predict that 10% of the absorbed stellar flux is redistributed to the
night side of the planet, which is qualitatively consistent with the
inefficient day-night redistribution apparent in the Kepler phase curve. Models
without thermal inversions fit the data only at the 1.25 sigma level, and also
require an overabundance of methane, which is not expected in the very hot

range that can guarantee interference safe (also termed hidden-node-free)
transmissions in CSMA networks under the cumulative interference model.
Compared with the safe carrier-sensing range under the commonly assumed but
less realistic pairwise interference model, we show that the safe
carrier-sensing range required under the cumulative interference model is
larger by a constant multiplicative factor. The concept of a safe
carrier-sensing range, although amenable to elegant analytical results, is
inherently not compatible with the conventional power threshold carrier-sensing
mechanism (e.g., that used in IEEE 802.11). Specifically, the absolute power
sensed by a node in the conventional mechanism does not contain enough
information for it to derive its distances from other concurrent transmitter
nodes. We show that, fortunately, a carrier-sensing mechanism called
Incremental-Power Carrier-Sensing (IPCS) can realize the carrier-sensing range
concept in a simple way. Instead of monitoring the absolute detected power, the
IPCS mechanism monitors every increment in the detected power. This means that
IPCS can separate the detected power of every concurrent transmitter, and map
the power profile to the required distance information.

region during the deepest extent of each third dredge-up episode. The protons
are captured by the abundant 12C to form a 13C pocket. The 13C pocket increases
the yields of 19F, 23Na, the neutron-rich Mg and Si isotopes, 60Fe, and 31P.
The increase in 31P is by factors of ~4 to 20, depending on the metallicity.
Any structural changes caused by the addition of the 13C pocket into the
He-intershell are ignored. However, the models considered are of low mass and
any such feedback is likely to be small. Further study is required to test the
accuracy of the yields from the partial-mixing models. For each mass and
metallicity, the yields are presented in a tabular form suitable for use in
galactic chemical evolution studies or for comparison to the composition of
planetary nebulae.

encode quantum information with local encoding circuits. They transmit their
encoded quantum data to a single receiver who then decodes the transmitted

nonlocal information qubits and the local resources are ancillas and local

useful in both the quantum communication scenario described above and in

quantum computation because we can prepare nonlocal resources offline and
exploit local encoding circuits. In particular, we derive an encoding circuit

precisely five distinct classes of topological insulators or superconductors.
Within a given class, the different topological sectors can be distinguished,
depending on the case, by a Z or a Z_2 topological invariant. This is an
exhaustive classification. Here we construct representatives of topological
insulators and superconductors for all five classes and in arbitrary spatial
dimension d, in terms of Dirac Hamiltonians. Using these representatives we
demonstrate how topological insulators (superconductors) in different
dimensions and different classes can be related via dimensional reduction by
compactifying one or more spatial dimensions (in Kaluza-Klein-like fashion).
For Z-topological insulators (superconductors) this proceeds by descending by
one dimension at a time into a different class. The Z_2-topological insulators
(superconductors), on the other hand, are shown to be lower-dimensional
descendants of parent Z-topological insulators in the same class, from which
they inherit their topological properties. The 8-fold periodicity in dimension
d that exists for topological insulators (superconductors) with Hamiltonians
satisfying at least one reality condition (arising from time-reversal or
charge-conjugation/particle-hole symmetries) is a reflection of the 8-fold
periodicity of the spinor representations of the orthogonal groups SO(N) (a
form of Bott periodicity). We derive a relation between the topological
invariant that characterizes topological insulators/superconductors with chiral
symmetry and the Chern-Simons invariant: it relates the invariant to the
electric polarization (d=1), or to the magnetoelectric polarizability (d=3).
Finally, we discuss topological field theories describing the space time theory
of linear responses, and study how the presence of inversion symmetry modifies
the classification.

differences) with the quantum Hall effect for the electric charge. As with the
quantum (electric charge) Hall effect, there exists a correspondence between
bulk and boundary physics that allows to characterize the quantum spin Hall
effect in diverse and complementary ways. In this paper, we derive from the
network model that encodes the quantum spin Hall effect, the so-called Z_2
network model, a Dirac Hamiltonian in two dimensions. In the clean limit of
this Dirac Hamiltonian, we show that the bulk Kane-Mele Z_2 invariant is
nothing but the SU(2) Wilson loop constructed from the SU(2) Berry connection
of the occupied Dirac-Bloch single-particle states. In the presence of
disorder, the non-linear sigma model (NLSM) that is derived from this Dirac
Hamiltonian describes a metal-insulator transition in the standard
two-dimensional symplectic universality class. In particular, we show that the
fermion doubling prevents the presence of a topological term in the NLSM that
would change the universality class of the ordinary two-dimensional symplectic
metal-insulator transition. This analytical result is fully consistent with our
previous numerical studies of the bulk critical exponents at the
metal-insulator transition encoded by the Z_2 network model. Finally, we
improve the quality and extend the numerical study of boundary multifractality
in the Z_2 topological insulator. We show that the hypothesis of
two-dimensional conformal invariance at the metal-insulator transition is
verified within the accuracy of our numerical results.

There are strong anti-correlations between EW (Ka) and two ""optical thickness

these anti-correlations, a set of quantitative criteria, EW (Ka) > 300eV,
L_{2-10keV} < 2L_[O III] and L_{FIR} > 600L_{2-10keV} can be established for

Further we simplify the problem and consider the pure $^{3}P_{2}$ pairing with

because of current conservation we have obtained a large suppression of the
neutrino emissivity in the vector channel. More exactly, the neutrino emission
through the vector channel vanishes in the nonrelativistic limit $V_F=0$. The
axial channel is also found to be moderately suppressed. The total neutrino

time evolution and small scatter of the galaxy SFR sequence -- the tight
correlation between star-formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass (M_star). The
steep decline of SFR from z~2 to the present, at fixed M_star, is a consequence
of the following: First, disk galaxies are in a steady state with the SFR
following the net (i.e., inflow minus outflow) gas accretion rate. The
evolution of the SFR sequence is determined by evolution in the cosmological
specific accretion rates, \propto (1+z)^{2.25}, but is found to be independent
of feedback. Although feedback determines the outflow rates, it shifts galaxies
along the SFR sequence, leaving its zero point invariant. Second, the
conversion of accretion rate to SFR is materialized through gas density, not
gas mass. Although the model SFR is an increasing function of both gas mass
fraction and gas density, only the gas densities are predicted to evolve
significantly with redshift. Third, star formation is fueled by molecular gas.
Since the molecular gas fraction increases monotonically with increasing gas
density, the model predicts strong evolution in the molecular gas fractions,
increasing by an order of magnitude from z=0 to z~2. On the other hand, the
model predicts that the effective surface density of atomic gas is ~10 M_sun
pc^{-2}, independent of redshift, stellar mass or feedback. Our model suggests
that the scatter in the SFR sequence reflects variations in the gas accretion
history, and thus is insensitive to stellar mass, redshift or feedback. The
large scatter in halo spin contributes negligibly, because it scatters galaxies
along the SFR sequence. An observational consequence of this is that the
scatter in the SFR sequence is independent of the size (both stellar and
gaseous) of galaxy disks.

and the dispersed location of nodes, are subject to several unique security
issues. One of the most vexed security threat is node capture. A few solutions
have already been proposed to address this problem; however, those solutions
are either centralized or focused on theoretical mobility models alone. In the
former case the solution does not fit well the distributed nature of the
network while, in the latter case, the quality of the solutions obtained for
realistic mobility models severely differs from the results obtained for
theoretical models. The rationale of this paper is inspired by the observation
that re-encounters of mobile nodes do elicit a form of social ties. Leveraging
these ties, it is possible to design efficient and distributed algorithms that,
with a moderated degree of node cooperation, enforce the emergent property of
node capture detection. In particular, in this paper we provide a proof of
concept proposing a set of algorithms that leverage, to different extent, node
mobility and node cooperation--that is, identifying social ties--to thwart node
capture attack. In particular, we test these algorithms on a realistic mobility
scenario. Extensive simulations show the quality of the proposed solutions and,
more important, the viability of the proposed approach.

This construction generalizes to any finite Coxeter group W. The authors
previously introduced the Hecke group algebra, constructed as the algebra

  In this paper, we consider instead the monoid generated by these operators.
We prove that it has |W| simple and projective modules. In order to construct a

combinatorial module whose support is the interval [1,w] in right weak order.
This module yields an algebra, whose representation theory generalizes that of

  The AGILE gamma-ray satellite detected the remarkable IBL S5 0716+714 (z

gamma-ray energies. Because of its high power and lack of signs for ongoing
accretion or surrounding gas, the source is an ideal candidate to test the
maximal power extractable from a rotating supermassive black hole via the pure

to both cool-core clusters and non-cool core cluster with an isothermal or
non-isothermal temperature structure. We derive an inversion technique through
which the electron distribution function can be extracted from spectroscopic
SZE observations over a wide frequency range. We study the fitting procedure to
extract the cluster temperature from a set of simulated spatially resolved
spectroscopic SZE observations in different bands of the spectrum, from 100 to
450 GHz. The results of our analysis for three different cluster prototypes
(A2199 with a low-temperature cool core, Perseus with a relatively
high-temperature cool core, Ophiuchus with an isothermal temperature
distribution) provide both the required precision of the SZE observations and
the optimal frequency bands for a determination of the cluster temperature
similar or better than that obtainable from X-ray observations. The precision
of SZE-derived temperature is also discussed for the outer regions of clusters.
We also study the possibility to extract, from our method, the parameters
characterizing the non-thermal SZE spectrum of the relativistic plasma

lines ranging from the UV to the infrared. We demonstrate the active frequency
stabilization of a diode laser on several praseodymium lines between 1105 and

observed via laser-induced fluorescence. These signals are strong enough to
lock the diode laser onto most of the lines by using standard laser locking
techniques. In this way, the frequency drifts of the unlocked laser of more

show regions with different conductivity values, probably due to the random
distribution of point defect or inhomogeneous changes of the local Mn3+/4+
ratio to reduce lattice strains of the irradiated areas. The transport and
magnetic properties of these systems are interpreted in this context.
Metal-insulator transition can be described in the frame of a percolative
model. Disorder increases the distance between conducting regions, lowering the
observed TMI. Point defect disorder increases localization of the carriers due
to increased disorder and locally enhanced strain field. Remarkably, even with
the inhomogeneous nature of the samples, no sign of low field magnetoresistance
was found. Point defect disorder decreases the system magnetization but doesn t
seem to change the magnetic transition temperature. As a consequence, an
important decoupling between the magnetic and the metal-insulator transition is
found for ion irradiated films as opposed to the classical double exchange
model scenario.

since it should commute with the supersymmetry condition. We provide a
prescription to properly fix the kappa-symmetry gauge condition to make it
consistent with light-cone gauge. We use fermionic field redefinitions to find
a simpler Lagrangian. To construct the Hamiltonian a Dirac procedure is needed

the energy spectrum and decays. We demonstrate that in our model, which
incorporates a relativistic kinetic energy term, a linear confining term
including its scalar-exchange relativistic corrections, and the complete
one-loop QCD short distance potential, such a consistent description, including
the measured hyperfine splitting, can be obtained by not softening the delta
function terms in the hyperfine potential. We calculate the hyperfine splitting
to be 67.5 MeV.

|N(I_c)| \geq |J| - |N(J)|$, for any independent set $J$. The \textit{critical
independence number} of a graph is the cardinality of a maximum critical
independent set. This number is a lower bound for the independence number and
can be computed in polynomial-time. Any graph can be decomposed into two
subgraphs where the independence number of one subgraph equals its critical
independence number, where the critical independence number of the other
subgraph is zero, and where the sum of the independence numbers of the
subgraphs is the independence number of the graph. A proof of a conjecture of
Graffiti.pc yields a new characterization of K\""{o}nig-Egervary graphs: these
are exactly the graphs whose independence and critical independence numbers are
equal.

eventually breaks down. However this transition occurs before the transition to

the bulk hydrodynamical medium created in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion
collisions. The model is based on perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD)
cross sections for $2\to 2$ processes in which a hard incoming parton is
assumed to interact with a thermal parton from the medium. We model the
interactions of this type in a Monte-Carlo framework to account properly for
exact energy-momentum conservation, non-eikonal parton propagation, parton
conversion reactions and the possibility to create additional hard recoiling
partons from the medium. For the thermodynamical properties of the medium we
use a hydrodynamical evolution model. We do not aim at a full description of
high transverse momentum ($P_T$) observables at this point. Rather, we view the
model as a starting point in obtaining a baseline of what to expect under the
assumptions that the medium is describable by thermal quasifree partons and
that their pQCD interactions with the high-energy partons are independent.
Deviations from this baseline then call for more sophisticated medium
description, as well as inclusion of higher-order processes and coherence
effects in the pQCD scatterings.

ph/cm^2/s detected during a flare in September 2009. Together with the
brightening of the source, a possible hardening of the gamma-ray spectrum is
observed, pointing to a shift of the inverse Compton peak toward higher
energies than the 1-10 MeV range in which 3C 273 inverse Compton emission is
typically observed to peak. During the 15 months of observations the photon
index is measured to vary between 2.4 and 3.3, with an average value of 2.78
+/- 0.03. When compared to the observations at other wavelengths, the
gamma-rays show the largest flux variations and we discuss the possibility that
two different components are responsible for the inverse Compton hump emission
below and above the MeV peak.
