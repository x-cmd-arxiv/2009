interactions that decouple when it is relativistic, is a viable dark matter
candidate provided it has never been in thermal equilibrium with the particles
of the standard model. This hidden hot dark matter may reheat to a lower
temperature and number density than the visible Universe and thus account,
simply with its thermal abundance, for all the dark matter in the Universe
while evading the typical constraints on hot dark matter arising from structure
formation. We find masses ranging from ~3 keV to ~10 TeV. While never in
equilibrium with the standard model, this class of models may have unique
observational signatures in the matter power spectrum or via extra-weak
interactions with standard model particles.

harbour a central supermassive black hole (SMBH). The mass of the SMBH

dispersion, which implies that the bulge and the SMBH of a galaxy have grown
together during the formation process. The spiral galaxy NGC3368 and the S0
galaxy NGC3489 both host a pseudobulge and a much smaller classical bulge
component at the centre. We present high resolution, near-infrared IFU data of
these two galaxies, taken with SINFONI at the VLT, and use axisymmetric orbit
models to determine the masses of the SMBHs. The SMBH mass of NGC3368 is
M_BH=7.5x10^6 M_sun with an error of 1.5x10^6 M_sun, which mostly comes from
the non-axisymmetry in the data. For NGC3489, a solution without black hole
cannot be excluded when modelling the SINFONI data alone, but can be clearly
ruled out when modelling a combination of SINFONI, OASIS and SAURON data, for
which we obtain M_BH=6.00^{+0.56}_{-0.54} (stat) +/- 0.64 (sys) x 10^6 M_sun.
Although both galaxies seem to be consistent with the M_BH-sigma relation, at
face value they do not agree with the relation between bulge magnitude and
black hole mass when the total bulge magnitude (i.e., including both classical
bulge and pseudobulge) is considered; the agreement is better when only the
small classical bulge components are considered. However, taking into account
the ageing of the stellar population could change this conclusion.

function to evaluate variations in integrated cluster properties. We find that
UBVK colors from our simulations are consistent with simple stellar population
(SSP) models, provided the cluster mass is large, Mcluster >= 10^6 M_Sun. Below
this mass, our simulations show two significant effects. First, the mean value
of the distribution of integrated colors moves away from the SSP predictions
and is less red, in the first 10^7 to 10^8 years in UBV colors, and for all
ages in (V - K). Second, the 1\sigma dispersion of observed colors increases
significantly with lower cluster mass. The former we attribute to the reduced
number of red luminous stars in most of the lower mass clusters and the later
we attribute to the increased stochastic effect of a few of these stars on
lower mass clusters. This later point was always assumed to occur, but we now
provide the first public code able to quantify this effect. We are completing a
more extensive database of magnitudes and colors as a function of stellar
cluster age and mass that will allow the determination of the correlation
coefficients among different bands, and improve estimates of cluster age and

multiferroic CuFe1-xAlxO2 with x=0.015, which exhibits the ferroelectric phase

various directions. From the present results, we have established the H-T
magnetic phase diagrams for the three principal directions of magnetic fields;
(i) parallel to the c axis, (ii) parallel to the helical axis, and (iii)
perpendicular to the c and the helical axes. While the previous dielectric

that the magnetic field dependence of the `magnetic domain structure' results
in distinct magnetic field responses of P [S. Seki et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.,

magnetic field dependence of the ferroelectric helimagnetic order `in each

of P in CuFe1-xAxO2 systems (A=Al, Ga).

cataloged counterpart at any wavelengths. Recently, the source G35.6-0.4 was
re-identified as a SNR. The HESS source lies towards the southern border of
this remnant. The purpose of this work is to investigate the interstellar
medium around the mentioned sources in order to look for possible counterparts
of the very-high energy emission. Using the 13CO J=1-0 line from the Galactic
Ring Survey and mid-IR data from GLIMPSE we analyze the environs of HESS
J1858+020 and SNR G35.6-0.4. The 13CO data show the presence of a molecular
cloud towards the southern border of SNR G35.6-0.4 and at the same distance as
the remnant. This cloud is composed by two molecular clumps, one, over the SNR
shell and the other located at the center of HESS J1858+020. We estimate a
molecular mass and a density of ~ 5 X 10^{3} Msun and ~ 500 cm^{-3},
respectively for each clump. Considering the gamma-ray flux observed towards
HESS J1858+020, we estimate that a molecular cloud with a density of at least
150 cm^{-3} could explain the very-high energy emission hadronically. Thus, we
suggest that the gamma-ray emission detected in HESS J1858+020 is due to
hadronic mechanism. Additionally, analyzing mid-IR emission, we find that the
region is active in star formation, which could be considered as an alternative
or complementary possibility to explain the very-high energy emission.

nulling interferometer for the near-to-mid-infrared spectral region. FKSI is
conceived as a mid-sized strategic or Probe class mission. FKSI has been
endorsed by the Exoplanet Community Forum 2008 as such a mission and has been
costed to be within the expected budget. The current design of FKSI is a
two-element nulling interferometer. The two telescopes, separated by 12.5 m,
are precisely pointed (by small steering mirrors) on the target star. The two
path lengths are accurately controlled to be the same to within a few
nanometers. A phase shifter/beam combiner (Mach-Zehnder interferometer)
produces an output beam consisting of the nulled sum of the target planet's
light and the host star's light. When properly oriented, the starlight is
nulled by a factor of 10^-4, and the planet light is undiminished. Accurate
modeling of the signal is used to subtract the residual starlight, permitting
the detection of planets much fainter than the host star. The current version
of FKSI with 0.5-m apertures and waveband 3-8 microns has the following main
capabilities: (1) detect exozodiacal emission levels to that of our own solar
system (1 Solar System Zodi) around nearby F, G, and K, stars; (2) characterize
spectroscopically the atmospheres of a large number of known non-transiting
planets; (3) survey and characterize nearby stars for planets down to 2 Earth
radii from just inside the habitable zone and inward. An enhanced version of
FKSI with 1-m apertures separated by 20 m and cooled to 40 K, with science
waveband 5-15 microns, allows for the detection and characterization of 2
Earth-radius super-Earths and smaller planets in the habitable zone around
stars within about 30 pc.

handful of carbon stars. --Aims: Previous observations of scattered stellar
light in the circumstellar medium around the carbon star U Ant were taken
through filters centred on the resonance lines of K and Na. These observations
could not separate the scattering by dust and atoms. The aim of this paper is
to remedy this situation. --Methods: We have obtained polarization data on
stellar light scattered in the circumstellar medium around U Ant through
filters which contain no strong lines, making it possible to differentiate
between the two scattering agents. Kinematic, as well as spatial, information
on the gas shells were obtained through high-resolution echelle spectrograph
observations of the KI and NaD lines. --Results: We confirm the existence of
two detached shells around U Ant. The inner shell (at a radius of approx 43""
and a width of approx 2"") consists mainly of gas, while the outer shell (at a
radius of approx 50"" and a width of approx 7"") appears to consist exclusively
of dust. Both shells appear to have an over-all spherical geometry. The gas
shell mass is estimated to be 2x10^-3 M(Sun), while the mass of the dust shell
is estimated to be 5x10^-5 M(Sun). The derived expansion velocity, from the KI
and NaD lines, of the gas shell, 19.5 km/s, agrees with that obtained from CO
radio line data. The inferred shell age is 2700 years. There is structure, e.g.
in the form of arcs, inside the gas shell, but it is not clear whether these
are due to additional shells. --Conclusions: Our results support the hypothesis
that the observed geometrically thin, detached shells around carbon stars are
the results of brief periods of intense mass loss, probably associated with
thermal pulses, and subsequent wind-wind interactions.

Current imaging techniques for graphene based sheets rely on the use of special

graphene oxide sheets deposited on arbitrary substrates can now be readily

contaminant sources with similar mid-infrared colours including a large number
of new ultra-compact (UC)HII regions. Aims:To measure the far-infrared (IR)
flux, which lies near the peak of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of
MYSOs and UCHII regions, so that, together with distance information, the
luminosity of these sources can be obtained. Methods:Less than 50% of RMS
sources are associated with IRAS point sources with detections at 60 micron and
100 micron, though the vast majority are visible in Spitzer MIPSGAL or IRAS
Galaxy Atlas (IGA) images. However, standard aperture photometry is not
appropriate for these data due to crowding of sources and strong spatially
variable far-IR background emission in the galactic plane. A new technique
using a 2-dimensional fit to the background in an annulus around each source is
therefore used to obtain far-IR photometry for young RMS sources.
Results:Far-IR fluxes are obtained for a total of 1113 RMS candidates
identified as young sources. Of these 734 have flux measurements using IGA 60
micron and 100 micron images and 724 using MIPSGAL 70 micron images, with 345
having measurements in both data sets.

not depend strongly on the parameters of either SNR or ISM. Analytic expression

quantum critical point is investigated. We derive scaling relations describing
its singular behavior in the quantum critical regime. Unlike it has been found
in previous studies, these relations are solely expressed in terms of
conventional critical exponents. We also describe in detail a quantum Monte
Carlo scheme that allows for the evaluation of the fidelity susceptibility for
a large class of many-body systems and apply it in the study of the quantum
phase transition for the transverse-field Ising model on the square lattice.
Finite size analysis applied to the so obtained numerical results confirm the
validity of our scaling relations. Furthermore, we analyze the properties of a
closely related quantity, the ground-state energy's second derivative, that can
be numerically evaluated in a particularly efficient way. The usefulness of
both quantities as alternative indicators of quantum criticality is examined.

either early (ERM, z_rei>= 7) or late (LRM, z_rei~6). We analyze the
transmitted flux in a sample of 17 quasars spectra at 5.7<z<6.4 and in the
spectrum of the gamma ray burst 050904 at z=6.3, studying the wide dark

of these spectral features with our models, we conclude that current
observational data do not require any sudden change in the ionization state of
the IGM at z~6, favouring indeed a highly ionized Universe at these epochs, as
predicted by the ERM. Moreover, we test the predictions of this model through
Lya emitters observations, finding that the ERM provide a good fit to the

marginal nonparametric learning. Our nonparametric independence screening is
called NIS, a specific member of the sure independence screening. Several
closely related variable screening procedures are proposed. Under the

screening is also explicitly quantified. As a methodological extension, an

enhance the finite sample performance for fitting sparse additive models. The

better than competing methods.

saddles and two nodes. In the latter configuration, which rest points are
connected by profiles depends on the ratio of viscosities, and can involve Lax,
overcompressive, or undercompressive shock profiles. For the monatomic and
diatomic cases $\gamma=5/3$ and $\gamma= 7/5$, with standard viscosity ratio
for a nonmagnetic gas, we find numerically that the the nodes are connected by
a family of overcompressive profiles bounded by Lax profiles connecting saddles
to nodes, with no undercompressive shocks occurring. We carry out a systematic
numerical Evans function analysis indicating that all of these two-dimensional
shock profiles are linearly and nonlinearly stable, both with respect to two-

viscosity ratios, we investigate also cases for which undercompressive shocks

tight binding Hamiltonian that is directly related to the type and strength of

to zero even if a large strain is applied, the band gap of graphene nanoribbon
(GNR) is sensitive to both uniaxial and shears strains. The effect of strain on
the electronic structure of a GNR strongly depends on its edge shape and
structural indices. For an armchair GNR, uniaxial weak strain changes the band
gap in a linear fashion, and for a large strain, it results in periodic
oscillation of the band gap. On the other hand, shear strain always tend to
reduce the band gap. For a zigzag GNR, the effect of strain is to change the
spin polarization at the edges of GNR, thereby modulate the band gap. A simple
analytical model is proposed to interpret the band gap responds to strain in
armchair GNR, which agrees with the numerical results.

strong interaction between the fan flow and shroud that causes quite different
flow structures about the airframe depending on flight conditions. A further
difficulty is related to the ground effect which produces substantial
modifications in the rotor thrust and aerodynamic coefficients. To evaluate
performance and stability, two models have been developed. One determines the
aerodynamic coefficients of the shroud, whereas the other one calculates thrust
and moment of the rotors system. Both models take into account the mutual
interference between fan flow and fuselage and ground effect. Performance and

in which the PPN parameter $\gamma$ was measured with an accuracy
$\sigma_\gamma = 2.3\times 10^{-5}$ and found consistent with the prediction
$\gamma =1$ of general relativity. The Orbit Determination Program (ODP) of
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which was used in the data analysis, is based
on an expression for the gravitational delay which differs from the standard
formula; this difference is of second order in powers of $m$ -- the sun's
gravitational radius -- but in Cassini's case it was much larger than the
expected order of magnitude $m^2/b$, where $b$ is the ray's closest approach
distance. Since the ODP does not account for any other second-order terms, it
is necessary, also in view of future more accurate experiments, to
systematically evaluate higher order corrections and to determine which terms
are significant. Light propagation in a static spacetime is equivalent to a
problem in ordinary geometrical optics; Fermat's action functional at its
minimum is just the light-time between the two end points A and B. A new and
powerful formulation is thus obtained. Asymptotic power series are necessary to
provide a safe and automatic way of selecting which terms to keep at each
order. Higher order approximations to the delay and the deflection are
obtained. We also show that in a close superior conjunction, when $b$ is much
smaller than the distances of A and B from the Sun, of order $R$, say, the
second-order correction has an \emph{enhanced} part of order $m^2R/b^2$, which
corresponds just to the second-order terms introduced in the ODP. Gravitational
deflection of the image of a far away source, observed from a finite distance
from the mass, is obtained to $O(m^2)$.

data for five sources (GX 5-1, GX 349+2, GX 13+1, GX 3+1, GX 9+1) and built
broad-band X-ray spectra from JEM-X1 and IBIS/ISGRI data. For each source,
X-ray spectra from different states were fitted with the recently proposed
model compTB. The spectra have been fit with a two-compTB model. In all cases
the first compTB describes the dominant part of the spectrum that we interpret
as thermal Comptonization of soft seed photons (< 1 keV), likely from the
accretion disk, by a 3-5 keV corona. In all cases, this component does not
evolve much in terms of Comptonization efficiency, with the system converging
to thermal equilibrium for increasing accretion rate. The second compTB varies
more dramatically spanning from bulk plus thermal Comptonization of blackbody
seed photons to the blackbody emission alone. These seed photons (R < 12 km,
kT_s > 1 keV), likely from the neutron star and the innermost part of the
system, the Transition Layer, are Comptonized by matter in a converging flow.
The presence and nature of this second compTB component (be it a pure blackbody
or Comptonized) are related to the inner local accretion rate which can
influence the transient behaviour of the hard tail: high values of accretion
rates correspond to an efficient Bulk Comptonization process (bulk parameter
delta > 0) while even higher values of accretion rates suppress the
Comptonization, resulting in simple blackbody emission (delta=0).

plasmas, also referred to as warm dense matter, is important in astrophysics,
since this thermodynamic regime is encountered for instance in Jovian planets'
interior. One of the most important issues is the need for accurate equations
of state and transport coefficients. The Ziman formula has been widely used for
the computation of the static (DC) electrical resistivity. Usually, the
calculations are based on the continuum wavefunctions computed in the
temperature and density-dependent self-consistent potential of a fictive atom,
representing the average ionization state of the plasma (average-atom model).
We present calculations of the electrical resistivity of a plasma based on the
superconfiguration (SC) formalism. In this modeling, the contributions of all
the electronic configurations are taken into account. It is possible to obtain
all the situations between the two limiting cases: detailed configurations (a
super-orbital is a single orbital) and detailed ions (all orbitals are gathered
in the same super-orbital). The ingredients necessary for the calculation are
computed in a self-consistent manner for each SC, using a density-functional
description of the electrons. Electron exchange-correlation is handled in the
local-density approximation. The momentum transfer cross-sections are
calculated by using the phase shifts of the continuum electron wavefunctions
computed, in the potential of each SC, by the Schroedinger equation with
relativistic corrections (Pauli approximation). Comparisons with experimental
data are also presented.

have {\it hard} continua in the medium-hard X-ray range but {\it soft} continua
in the LAT gamma-ray range (photon indices $\Gamma_X$ \ltsima 2 and $\Gamma_G$

opposite behavior, i.e., {\it soft} X-ray and {\it hard} gamma-ray continua
($\Gamma_X$ \gtsima 2.4 and $\Gamma_G < 2$). The trends are confirmed by
detailed Monte Carlo simulations explicitly taking into account the
observational biases of both instruments. Our results support the so-called
``blazar sequence'' which was originally based on radio samples of blazars and

sets of theories: one where the inflaton has a large cubic self-interaction and
one where the inflaton interacts gravitationally with N massless spectator
scalar fields. We find that there is a logarithmic running but of the form
log(H/mu), where H is the Hubble constant during inflation. We find this result
in three independent ways: by performing the calculation with a sharp cutoff in
frequency-momentum space, in dimensional regularization and by the simple
procedure of making the loop integral dimensionless. For the simplest of our
theories we explicitly renormalize the correlation function proving that the
divergencies can be reabsorbed and that the correlation function for
super-horizon modes does not depend on time (once the tadpole terms have been
properly taken into account). We prove the time-independence of the
super-horizon correlation function in several additional ways: by doing the
calculation of the correlation function at finite time using both the
regularizations and by developing a formalism which expresses loop corrections
directly in terms of renormalized quantities at each time. We find this last
formalism particularly helpful to develop intuition which we then use to
generalize our results to higher loops and different interactions.

corresponds to differentiating between scalars and fermions as heavy mediators

gravitomagnetic sector of the metric to leading order, thus introducing
modifications to the moment of inertia but not to the mass-radius relation. We
show that an observational determination of the moment of inertia to an

investigate fast map-making methods as applied to long duration, massively

B-modes. We focus on two alternative map-making approaches: destriping and TOD
filtering, comparing their performance on simulated multi-detector polarisation
data. We have written an optimised, parallel destriping code, the DEStriping
CARTographer DESCART, that is generalised for massive focal planes, including
the potential effect of cross-correlated TOD 1/f noise. We also determine the
scaling of computing time for destriping as applied to a simulated full-season
data-set for a realistic experiment. We find that destriping can out-perform
filtering in estimating both the large-scale E and B-mode angular power
spectra. In particular, filtering can produce significant spurious B-mode power
via EB mixing. Whilst this can be removed, it contributes to the variance of
B-mode bandpower estimates at scales near the primordial B-mode peak. For the
experimental configuration we simulate, this has an effect on the possible
detection significance for primordial B-modes. Destriping is a viable
alternative fast method to the full M-L approach that does not cause the
problems associated with filtering, and is flexible enough to fit into both M-L

too many passive satellite galaxies in clusters, too few passive central
galaxies with low stellar masses, and too many passive central galaxies with
high masses. We then outline a series of modifications to the model necessary
to solve these problems: a) Instead of instantaneous stripping of the external
gas reservoir after a galaxy becomes a satellite, the gas supply is assumed to
decrease at the same rate that the surrounding halo loses mass due to tidal
stripping, b) The AGN feedback efficiency is lowered to bring the fraction of
massive passive centrals in better agreement with the data. We also allow for
radio mode AGN feedback in satellite galaxies. c) We assume that satellite
galaxies residing in host haloes with masses below 10^12 M_sun do not undergo
any stripping. We highlight the fact that in low mass galaxies, the external
reservoir is composed primarily of gas that has been expelled from the galactic
disk by supernovae driven winds. This gas must remain available as a future
reservoir for star formation, even in satellite galaxies. Finally, we present a
simple recipe for the stripping of gas and dark matter in satellites that can
be used in models where subhalo evolution is not followed in detail.

absorption velocities reside fully to one side of the galaxy systemic velocity
and usually align with one arm of the rotation curve. In all cases, a constant
rotating thick-disk model poorly reproduces the full spread of observed MgII
absorption velocities when reasonably realistic parameters are employed. In
2/10 cases, the galaxy kinematics, star formation surface densities, and
absorption kinematics have a resemblance to those of high redshift galaxies
showing strong outflows. We find that MgII absorption velocity spread and
optical depth distribution may be dependent on galaxy inclination. To further

While intrinsic representations lower the cost of the linear algebra
operations, we observe worse condition numbers. In this paper we describe the
local adaptation of intrinsic coordinates to improve the numerical conditioning
of sampling algebraic sets. Local intrinsic coordinates also lead to a better
stepsize control. We illustrate our results with Maple experiments and
computations with PHCpack on some benchmark polynomial systems.

along the axis of protostellar jets in a wide range of bands. Evidence of
interactions between knots formed in different epochs have been found,
suggesting that jets may result from the ejection of plasma blobs from the
source. We aim at investigating the physical mechanism leading to the irregular
knotty structure observed in jets in different bands and the complex
interactions occurring among blobs of plasma ejected from the stellar source.
We perform 2D axisymmetric HD simulations of a randomly ejected pulsed jet. The
jet consists of a train of blobs which ram with supersonic speed into the
ambient medium. The initial random velocity of each blob follows an exponential
distribution. We explore the ejection rate parameter to derive constraints on
the physical properties of protostellar jets by comparison of model results
with observations. Our model takes into account radiative losses and thermal
conduction. We find that the mutual interactions of blobs ejected at different
epochs and with different speed lead to a variety of plasma components not
described by current models. The main features characterizing the random pulsed
jet scenario are: single high speed knots, showing a measurable proper motion
in nice agreement with observations; irregular chains of knots aligned along
the jet axis and possibly interacting with each other; reverse shocks
interacting with outgoing knots; oblique shocks produced by the reflection of
shocks at the jet cocoon. All these structures concur to determine the
morphology of the jet in different bands. We also find that the thermal
conduction plays a crucial role in damping out HD instabilities that would
develop within the cocoon and that contribute to the jet breaking.

simultaneously subdifferential operators of convex functions and positive

undertaken a study of stellar activity and kinematics for this star over the
past few years. Previous results show a high level of stellar activity, with
the presence of prominence-like structures, spots on the surface and strong
flare events, despite the moderate rotational velocity of the star. In
addition, radial velocity variations with a semi-amplitude of up to 1 km/s were
detected. We investigated the nature of these radial velocity variations, in
order to determine whether they are due to stellar activity or the reflex
motion of the star induced by a companion. We have analysed high-resolution
echelle spectra and also two-band photometry was obtained to produce the light
curve and determine the photometric period. Based upon the analysis of the
bisector velocity span, as well as spectroscopic indices of chromospheric
indicators and taking into account the photometric analysis, we report that the
best explanation for the RV variation is the presence of a sub-stellar
companion. The Keplerian fit of the RV data yields a solution for a close-in
massive planet with an orbital period of 7.78 days. The presence of the
close-in massive planet could also be an interpretation for the high level of
stellar activity detected. Since the RV data are not part of a planet search
program, we can consider our results as a serendipitous evidence of a planetary
companion. To date, this is the youngest main sequence star for which a
planetary candidate has been reported.

conditions and long-term changes in fish populations adds to the need to
understand the effects of stochastic forcing on marine populations. Cohort
resonance is of particular interest because it involves selective sensitivity
to specific time scales of environmental variability, including that of mean
age of reproduction, and, more importantly, very low frequencies (i.e.,
trends). We present an age-structured model for two Pacific salmon species with
environmental variability in survival rate and in individual growth rate, hence
spawning age distribution. We use computed frequency response curves and
analysis of the linearized dynamics to obtain two main results. First, the
frequency response of the population is affected by the life history stage at
which variability affects the population; varying growth rate tends to excite
periodic resonance in age structure, while varying survival tends to excite
low-frequency fluctuation with more effect on total population size. Second,
decreasing adult survival strengthens the cohort resonance effect at all
frequencies, a finding that addresses the question of how fishing and climate
change will interact.

questions, e.g., ""Is there a dead state?"" and ""Can N become negative?"", or as a
starting point for sophisticated investigations expressed in temporal logic.
  Unfortunately, the state space is often so large that ordinary explicit data
structures and sequential algorithms cannot cope, prompting the exploration of
(1) parallel approaches using multiple processors, from simple workstation
networks to shared-memory supercomputers, to satisfy large memory and runtime
requirements and (2) symbolic approaches using decision diagrams to encode the
large structured sets and relations manipulated during state-space generation.
  Both approaches have merits and limitations. Parallel explicit state-space
generation is challenging, but almost linear speedup can be achieved; however,
the analysis is ultimately limited by the memory and processors available.
Symbolic methods are a heuristic that can efficiently encode many, but not all,
functions over a structured and exponentially large domain; here the pitfalls
are subtler: their performance varies widely depending on the class of decision
diagram chosen, the state variable order, and obscure algorithmic parameters.
  As symbolic approaches are often much more efficient than explicit ones for
many practical models, we argue for the need to parallelize symbolic
state-space generation algorithms, so that we can realize the advantage of both
approaches. This is a challenging endeavor, as the most efficient symbolic
algorithm, Saturation, is inherently sequential. We conclude by discussing
challenges, efforts, and promising directions toward this goal.

centre and their spatial distribution is quite similar. Most of the H-alpha
emitters show blue colours, but we find some H-alpha emitters on the red
sequence. The MIR galaxies tend to be systematically redder than the H-alpha
emitters probably due to heavy dust extinction. Interestingly, the red H-alpha
emitters and the red MIR galaxies (i.e. dusty red galaxies) are most commonly
seen in the medium-density environment such as cluster outskirts, groups and
filaments, where optical colours of galaxies change. We also find that A(Ha)
exceeds ~3 in extreme cases and that such very dusty galaxies are also located
in the medium-density environment. These findings suggest that dusty star
formation is triggered in the in-fall region of the cluster, implying a
probable link between galaxy transition and dusty star formation. We finally
calculate the cluster total SFR and find that the cluster total SFR based on
H-alpha alone can be underestimated more than factor ~2 even after 1 mag

declines since z~1 following ~(1+z)^6, although the uncertainty is still large.

classification for connected integrable GL(2)-structures, and an equivalence
between local integrable GL(2)-structures and Hessian hydrodynamic hyperbolic

avoid 'strong' absorption lines accompanied with contaminating emission
components. The same analysis is applied to archive data of Gemini/GMOS taken
at phi=0.84-0.30 by Hillwig & Gies (2008). From the Subaru and Gemini CCF
results, the amplitude of radial velocity curve of the donor star is determined
to be 58.3+/-3.8 km s-1 with a systemic velocity of 59.2+/-2.5 km s-1. Together
with the radial velocity curve of the compact object, we derive the mass of the
donor star and compact object to be M_O=12.4+/-1.9 M_sun and M_X=4.3+/-0.6
M_sun, respectively. We conclude, however, that these values should be taken as
upper limits. From the analysis of the averaged absorption line profiles of
strong lines and weak lines observed with Subaru, we find evidence for heating
effects from the compact object. Using a simple model, we find that the true
radial velocity amplitude of the donor star could be as low as 40+/-5 km s-1 in
order to produce the observed absorption-line profiles. Taking into account the
heating of the donor star may lower the derived masses to M_O=10.4 +2.3/-1.9
M_sun and M_X=2.5 +0.7/-0.6 M_sun. Our final constraint, 1.9 M_sun< M_X <4.9
M_sun, indicates that the compact object in SS 433 is most likely a low mass
black hole, although the possibility of a massive neutron star cannot be firmly
excluded.

imaging data from portions of the NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey and the Deep Lens

Thirty candidates have R <= 23 mags. We conducted spectroscopic followup for 28

faint-end slope -2 < beta < -2.5. In all cases, we consistently find faint-end
slopes that are steeper than expected based on measurements at z ~ 3. We
combine our sample with bright quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to
derive parameters for a double-power-law luminosity function. Our best fit
finds a bright-end slope, alpha = -2.4+/-0.2, and faint-end slope, beta =
-2.3+/-0.2, without a well-constrained break luminosity. This is effectively a
single power-law, with beta = -2.7+/-0.1. We use these results to place limits

possible that Z's are heavy enough to lie beyond the discovery reach expected
at the CERN Large Hadron Collider LHC, in which case only indirect signatures
of Z' exchanges may occur at future colliders, through deviations of the
measured cross sections from the Standard Model predictions. We here discuss in
this context the foreseeable sensitivity to Z's of fermion-pair production
cross sections at an e^+e^- linear collider, especially as regards the
potential of distinguishing different Z' models once such deviations are
observed. Specifically, we assess the discovery and identification reaches on
Z' gauge bosons pertinent to the E_6, LR, ALR and SSM classes of models, that
should be attained at the planned International Linear Collider (ILC). With the
high experimental accuracies expected at the ILC, the discovery and the
identification reaches on the Z' models under consideration could be increased
substantially. In particular, the identification among the different models
could be achieved for values of Z' masses in the discovery (but beyond the
identification) reach of the LHC. An important role in enhancing such reaches
is played by the electron (and possibly the positron) longitudinally polarized
beams. Also, although the purely leptonic processes are experimentally cleaner,
the measurements of c- and b-quark pair production cross sections are found to
carry important, and complementary, information on these searches.

to treat realistic datasets to initialize and calibrate the system. A precise
reproduction of initial states is extremely important to obtain reliable
forecast from the model. Methodology/Principal Findings: This paper proposes an
algorithm to create an artificial population where individuals are described by
their age, and are gathered in households respecting a variety of statistical
constraints (distribution of household types, sizes, age of household head,
difference of age between partners and among parents and children). Such a
population is often the initial state of microsimulation or (agent)
individual-based models. To get a realistic distribution of households is often
very important, because this distribution has an impact on the demographic
evolution. Usual techniques from microsimulation approach cross different
sources of aggregated data for generating individuals. In our case the number
of combinations of different households (types, sizes, age of participants)
makes it computationally difficult to use directly such methods. Hence we
developed a specific algorithm to make the problem more easily tractable.
Conclusions/Significance: We generate the populations of two pilot
municipalities in Auvergne region (France), to illustrate the approach. The
generated populations show a good agreement with the available statistical
datasets (not used for the generation) and are obtained in a reasonable
computational time.

systems yields that the perturbation expansion (Lindstedt series) for
quasi-periodic solutions with Diophantine frequency vector converges. If one
studies the Lindstedt series, one finds that convergence is ultimately related
to the presence of cancellations between contributions of the same perturbation
order. In turn, this is due to symmetries in the problem. Such symmetries are
easily visualised in action-angle coordinates, where KAM theorem is usually
formulated, by exploiting the analogy between Lindstedt series and perturbation
expansions in quantum field theory and, in particular, the possibility of
expressing the solutions in terms of tree graphs, which are the analogue of
Feynman diagrams. If the unperturbed system is isochronous, Moser's modifying
terms theorem ensures that an analytic quasi-periodic solution with the same
Diophantine frequency vector as the unperturbed Hamiltonian exists for the
system obtained by adding a suitable constant (counterterm) to the vector
field. Also in this case, one can follow the alternative approach of studying
the perturbation expansion for both the solution and the counterterm, and again
convergence of the two series is obtained as a consequence of deep
cancellations between contributions of the same order. We revisit Moser's
theorem, by studying the perturbation expansion one obtains by working in
Cartesian coordinates. We investigate the symmetries giving rise to the
cancellations which makes possible the convergence of the series. We find that
the cancellation mechanism works in a completely different way in Cartesian
coordinates. The interpretation of the underlying symmetries in terms of tree
graphs is much more subtle than in the case of action-angle coordinates.

K. In the magnetic ordering state, four hole-like Fermi surface sheets are
observed near $\Gamma$(0,0) and the Fermi surface near M(+/-$\pi$,+/-$\pi$)
shows a tiny electron-like pocket at M surrounded by four Dirac cone-like
strong spots. The unusual Fermi surface topology deviates strongly from the
band structure calculations. The electronic signature of the
magnetic/structural transition shows up in the dramatic change of the
quasiparticle scattering rate. A dispersion kink at $\sim$ 25meV is for the
first time observed in the parent compound of Fe-based superconductors.

technology in recent years because of the rapid proliferation of wireless

dynamically changing network topology and lack of centralized monitoring point.
It is important to search new architecture and mechanisms to protect the
wireless networks and mobile computing application. IDS analyze the network
activities by means of audit data and use patterns of well-known attacks or
normal profile to detect potential attacks. There are two methods to analyze:
misuse detection and anomaly detection. Misuse detection is not effective
against unknown attacks and therefore, anomaly detection method is used. In
this approach, the audit data is collected from each mobile node after
simulating the attack and compared with the normal behavior of the system. If
there is any deviation from normal behavior then the event is considered as an
attack. Some of the features of collected audit data may be redundant or
contribute little to the detection process. So it is essential to select the
important features to increase the detection rate. This paper focuses on
implementing two feature selection methods namely, markov blanket discovery and
genetic algorithm. In genetic algorithm, bayesian network is constructed over
the collected features and fitness function is calculated. Based on the fitness
value the features are selected. Markov blanket discovery also uses bayesian
network and the features are selected depending on the minimum description
length. During the evaluation phase, the performances of both approaches are
compared based on detection rate and false alarm rate.

  Phys",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There are four reasons why our present knowledge and understanding of quantum
mechanics could be regarded as incomplete. Firstly, the principle of linear
superposition has not been experimentally tested for position eigenstates of
objects having more than about a thousand atoms. Secondly, there is no
universally agreed upon explanation for the process of quantum measurement.
Thirdly, there is no universally agreed upon explanation for the observed fact
that macroscopic objects are not found in superposition of position
eigenstates. Fourthly, and perhaps most importantly, the concept of time is
classical and hence external to quantum mechanics : there should exist an
equivalent reformulation of the theory which does not refer to an external
classical time. In this paper we argue that such a reformulation is the
limiting case of a nonlinear quantum theory, with the nonlinearity becoming
important at the Planck mass scale. Such a nonlinearity can provide insights
into the problems mentioned above. We use a physically motivated model for a
nonlinear Schrodinger equation to show that nonlinearity can help in
understanding quantum measurement. We also show that while the principle of
linear superposition holds to a very high accuracy for atomic systems, the
lifetime of a quantum superposition becomes progressively smaller, as one goes
from microscopic to macroscopic objects. This can explain the observed absence
of position superpositions in macroscopic objects [lifetime is too small]. It
also suggests that ongoing laboratory experiments maybe able to detect the
finite superposition lifetime for mesoscopic objects, in the foreseeable
future.

forms a hot-bubble and neutrino-driven wind region of which electron mole
fraction exceeds 0.5 in several seconds after the core collapse. When a higher
resonance of the RSF conversion is located in the innermost region, flavor
change of the neutrinos strongly depends on the sign of 1-2Ye. At an adiabatic
high RSF resonance the flavor conversion of bar{nu}_e -> nu_{mu,tau} occurs in
Ye < 0.5 and normal mass hierarchy or in Ye > 0.5 and inverted mass hierarchy.
In other cases of Ye values and mass hierarchies, the conversion of nu_e ->

of Ye < 0.5 and Ye > 0.5 taking account of the RSF conversion. Based on the
obtained result, time variation of the event number ratios of low bar{nu}_e

enhancement of the event ratio should be seen in the period when the electron
fraction in the innermost region exceeds 0.5. In inverted mass hierarchy, on

site using the ATM transmission code. We find the wet dispersive path delay
becomes a significant fraction (>5 per cent) of the non-dispersive delay for
the high-frequency ALMA bands (>160 GHz, Bands 5 to 10). Additionally, the
variation in dispersive path delay across ALMA's 4-GHz contiguous bandwidth is
not significant except in Bands 9 and 10. The ratio of dispersive path delay to
total column of water vapour does not vary significantly for typical amounts of
water vapour, water vapour scale heights and ground pressures above Chajnantor.
However, the temperature profile and particularly the ground-level temperature
are more important. Given the likely constraints from ALMA's ancillary

well known that the autoparallel trajectories can be obtained from a
variational principle based on a non-holonomic mapping, starting with the
standard world-line action. In a contrast, we explore a world-line action with
a modified metric, thinking about the old idea of contorsion (torsion)
potentials. A fixed-ends variational principle can reproduce autoparallel
trajectories without restrictions on space-time torsion. As an illustration we
have considered a perturbative Weitzenb$\ddot{o}$ck space-time. The
non-perturbative problem is stablished at the end.

neutral hydrogens in the ambient medium. In the precursor of an SNR shock
modified by cosmic rays (CRs), upstream plasmas are pushed by the CR pressure,
but neutral particles are not, so that the relative velocity appears and some
neutral particles become pickup ions by the charge exchange process in the
precursor. We investigate how the pickup ions generated in the precursor affect
the shock structure and the particle acceleration. If the CR pressure is larger
than 20% of the shock ram pressure, the compression of the subshock becomes
smaller than that without pickup ions because of the pressure of the pickup
ions. Moreover, even if the shock is modified by CRs, the total compression
ratio can be smaller than 4. In addition, the pickup ions play an important
role for the injection into the particle acceleration. If the shock is a
quasi-perpendicular shock and if the the multiply reflected ion acceleration
occurs, the CR spectrum can be harder than that of the test particle diffusive
shock acceleration below GeV.

10s of $\mu$J pulse energy. Here we present a numerical study of cascaded
quadratic soliton compression of such pulses in LiNbO$_3$ using a type I phase
matching configuration. We find that because of competing cubic material
nonlinearities compression can only occur in the nonstationary regime, where
group-velocity mismatch induced Raman-like nonlocal effects prevent compression
to below 100 fs. However, the strong group velocity dispersion implies that the
pulses can achieve moderate compression to sub-130 fs duration in available
crystal lengths. Most of the pulse energy is conserved because the compression
is moderate. The effects of diffraction and spatial walk-off is addressed, and
in particular the latter could become an issue when compressing in such long
crystals (around 10 cm long). We finally show that the second harmonic contains
a short pulse locked to the pump and a long multi-ps red-shifted detrimental
component. The latter is caused by the nonlocal effects in the nonstationary
regime, but because it is strongly red-shifted to a position that can be
predicted, we show that it can be removed using a bandpass filter, leaving a
sub-100 fs visible component at $\lambda=515$ nm with excellent pulse quality.

implied by previous proofs that $q^{app}_0$ has to be positive in a smooth LTB

  The observational signatures of smooth LTB matter dominated models are
fundamentally different from the ones of $\Lambda CDM $ models not only because
it is not possible to reproduce a negative apparent central deceleration
$q^{app}_0$, but because of deeper differences in their space-time geometry
which make impossible the inversion problem when more than one observable is
considered, and emerge at any redshift, not only for $z=0$.

bolometric luminosity. The observations are also compared to models with and

irradiated walls of the cavity sculpted by the outflow. The visibilities rule
out the presence of dust disks with total (gas and dust) masses more than 0.01
Msun. However, optically thick accretion disks, interior to the dust
sublimation radius, are allowed to accrete at rates equalling the envelope's
mass infall rate (up to 10^(-3) Msun/yr) without substantially affecting the

name to Newton-Wigner localization) and modular localization which is the
localization underlying QFT, after one separates it from its standard
presentation in terms of field coordinates. The first comes with a probability
notion and projection operators, whereas the latter describes causal
propagation in QFT and leads to thermal aspects of locally reduced finite
energy states. The Born-Newton-Wigner localization in QFT is only applicable
asymptotically and the covariant correlation between asymptotic in and out
localization projectors is the basis of the existence of an invariant
scattering matrix. In this first part of a two part essay the modular

(i) for the directed polymer of length $N$ in a two-dimensional medium, where
many exact results exist (ii) for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin-glass model
of $N$ spins, where various possibilities have been proposed. Here we stress
that, besides the behavior of the disorder-average $E_0^{av}(N)$ and of the
standard deviation $ \Delta E_0(N) \sim N^{\omega_f}$ that defines the
fluctuation exponent $\omega_f$, it is very instructive to study the full
probability distribution $\Pi(u)$ of the rescaled variable $u=
\frac{E_0(N)-E_0^{av}(N)}{\Delta E_0(N)}$ : (a) numerically, the convergence
towards $\Pi(u)$ is usually very rapid, so that data on rather small sizes but
with high statistics allow to measure the two tails exponents $\eta_{\pm}$
defined as $\ln \Pi(u \to \pm \infty) \sim - | u |^{\eta_{\pm}}$. In the
generic case $1< \eta_{\pm} < +\infty$, this leads to explicit non-trivial
terms in the asymptotic behaviors of the moments $\bar{Z_N^n}$ of the partition
function when the combination $[| n | N^{\omega_f}]$ becomes large (b) simple
rare events arguments can usually be found to obtain explicit relations between
$\eta_{\pm}$ and $\omega_f$. These rare events usually correspond to
'anomalous' large deviation properties of the generalized form $R(w_{\pm} =
\frac{E_0(N)-E_0^{av}(N)}{N^{\kappa_{\pm}}}) \sim e^{- N^{\rho_{\pm}} {\cal
R}_{\pm}(w_{\pm})}$ (the 'usual' large deviations formalism corresponds to

interpolated Hamiltonian equation whose exact solution coincides with the
discrete flow at each time step over a long time depending on a non resonance
condition satisfied by the stepsize. We introduce a class of modified splitting
schemes fulfilling this condition at a high order and prove for them that the
numerical flow and the continuous flow remain close over exponentially long
time with respect to the step size. For stan- dard splitting or
implicit-explicit scheme, such a backward error analysis result holds true on a
time depending on a cut-off condition in the high frequencies (CFL condition).
This analysis is valid in the case where the linear operator has a discrete
(bounded domain) or continuous (the whole space) spectrum.

extending this very methodology to the $\Phi-$divergence. Furthermore, we will

almost only depends on the gap but is hardly affected by the departure. While
for the departure large enough, it rapidly enhances the neutrino emissivity.

calculate the energy barriers in tunneling structures, with higher accuracy and
speed. Taking into account the stochastic-like nature of the samples of all the
involved wave functions for many body problems, a statistical optimization is
made by considering the covariance matrix of these samples. An eigenvalues
system is obtained and solved for the optimal basis set and by inspecting the
rapidly decreasing eigenvalues one may seriously reduce the necessary number of
vectors that insures an imposed precision. This leads to a potentially
significant improvement in the speed of the SCF calculations and accuracy, as
the statistical properties of a large number of wave functions in an large
spatial domain may be considered. The eigenvalue problem has to be solved only
few times, so that the amount of time added may be much smaller that the
overall iterating SCF calculations. A simple implementation of the method is
presented for a situation where the analytical solution is known, and the

which consists in dispensing picoliter to nanoliter drops on demand directly in
the liquid-filled channels of a polymer microfluidic chip, at frequencies up to
2.5 kHz and with precise volume control. The technique involves a PDMS chip
with one or several microliter-size chambers driven by piezoelectric actuators.
Individual aqueous microdrops are dispensed from the chamber to a main
transport channel filled with an immiscible fluid, in a process analogous to
atmospheric drop on demand dispensing. In this article, the drop formation
process is characterized with respect to critical dispense parameters such as
the shape and duration of the driving pulse, and the size of both the fluid
chamber and the nozzle. Several features of the in-chip drop on demand
technique with direct relevance to lab on a chip applications are presented and
discussed, such as the precise control of the dispensed volume, the ability to
merge drops of different reagents and the ability to move a drop from the
shooting area of one nozzle to another for multi-step reactions. The
possibility to drive the microfluidic chip with inexpensive audio electronics
instead of research-grade equipment is also examined and verified. Finally, we
show that the same piezoelectric technique can be used to generate a single gas
bubble on demand in a microfluidic chip.

ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX), Holmberg IX X-1. The source luminosity varies
by a factor 3-4, giving rise to corresponding spectral changes which are
significant, but subtle, and not well tracked by a simple hardness ratio.
Instead, we co-add the Swift data in intensity bins and do full spectral
fitting with disc plus thermal Comptonisation models. All the data are
well-fitted by a low temperature, optically thick Comptonising corona, and the
variability can be roughly characterised by decreasing temperature and
increasing optical depth as the source becomes brighter, as expected if the
corona is becoming progressively mass loaded by material blown off the
super-Eddington inner disc. This variability behaviour is seen in other ULX
which have similar spectra, but is opposite to the trend seen in ULX with much
softer spectra. This supports the idea that there are two distinct physical
regimes in ULXs, where the spectra go from being dominated by a disc-corona to
being dominated by a wind.

Ricci flow on a closed manifold M with the harmonic map flow of a map phi from
M to some closed target manifold N with a (possibly time-dependent) positive
coupling constant alpha. This system can be interpreted as the gradient flow of
an energy functional F_alpha which is a modification of Perelman's energy F for
the Ricci flow, including the Dirichlet energy for the map phi. Surprisingly,
the coupled system may be less singular than the Ricci flow or the harmonic map
flow alone. In particular, we can always rule out energy concentration of phi
a-priori - without any assumptions on the curvature of the target manifold N -
by choosing alpha large enough. Moreover, if alpha is bounded away from zero it
suffices to bound the curvature of (M,g(t)) to also obtain control of phi and
all its derivatives - a result which is clearly not true for alpha = 0. Besides
these new phenomena, the flow shares many good properties with the Ricci flow.
In particular, we can derive the monotonicity of an entropy functional W_alpha
similar to Perelman's Ricci flow entropy W and of so-called reduced volume
functionals. We then apply these monotonicity results to rule out non-trivial
breathers and geometric collapsing at finite times.

focused primarily on finding conditions for a degree sequence to be potentially

  We first give a theorem for $\pi$ to be forcibly 1-factor graphical and, more
generally, forcibly graphical with deficiency at most $\beta\ge0$. These
theorems are equal in strength to Chv\'atal's well-known hamiltonian theorem,
i.e., the best monotone degree condition for hamiltonicity. We then give an
equally strong theorem for $\pi$ to be forcibly 2-factor graphical.
Unfortunately, the number of nonredundant conditions that must be checked
increases significantly in moving from $k=1$ to $k=2$, and we conjecture that
the number of nonredundant conditions in a best monotone theorem for a
$k$-factor will increase superpolynomially in $k$.
  This suggests the desirability of finding a theorem for $\pi$ to be forcibly
$k$-factor graphical whose algorithmic complexity grows more slowly. In the
final section, we present such a theorem for any $k\ge2$, based on Tutte's
well-known factor theorem. While this theorem is not best monotone, we show
that it is nevertheless tight in a precise way, and give examples illustrating
this tightness.

II Cepheid variables may be characterized by a common Wesenheit
period-magnitude relation, to first order. Reliable distance estimates to RR
Lyrae variables and Type II Cepheids are ascertained from a single VI-based
reddening-free relation derived recently from OGLE photometry of LMC Type II
Cepheids. Distances are computed to RR Lyrae (d~260 pc), and variables of its
class in the galaxies IC 1613, M33, Fornax dSph, LMC, SMC, and the globular
clusters M3, M15, M54, omega Cen, NGC 6441, and M92. The results are consistent
with literature estimates, and in the particular cases of the SMC, M33, and IC
1613, the distances agree with that inferred from classical Cepheids to within
the uncertainties: no corrections were applied to account for differences in
metallicity. Moreover, no significant correlation was observed between the
distances computed to RR Lyrae variables in omega Cen and their metallicity,
despite a considerable spread in abundance across the sample. In sum, concerns
regarding a sizeable metallicity effect are allayed when employing VI-based
reddening-free Cepheid and RR Lyrae relations.

matroid. For each matroid $M$, weight function
$\omega:E(M)\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$, and positive integer $D$, the following are
equivalent. (1) For all $A\subseteq E(M)$, we have $\sum_{a\in A}\omega(a)\le
D\cdot r(A)$. (2) There is a map $\phi$ that assigns to each element $e$ of
$E(M)$ a set $\phi(e)$ of $\omega(e)$ cyclically consecutive elements in the
cycle $(1,2,...,D)$ so that each set $\{e|i\in\phi(e)\}$, for $i=1,...,D$, is
independent.
  As a first corollary we obtain the following. For each matroid $M$ so that
$|E(M)|$ and $r(M)$ are coprime, the following are equivalent. (1) For all
non-empty $A\subseteq E(M)$, we have $|A|/r(A)\le|E(M)|/r(M)$. (2) There is a
cyclic permutation of $E(M)$ in which all sets of $r(M)$ cyclically consecutive
elements are bases of $M$. A second corollary is that the circular arboricity
of a matroid is equal to its fractional arboricity.
  These results generalise classical results of Edmonds, Nash-Williams and
Tutte on covering and packing matroids by bases and graphs by spanning trees.

is the Gaussian distribution and a novel nontrivial fixed point is a
multifractal distribution that emulates the Feigenbaum attractor, and is
universal in the sense of the latter. The crossover between the two fixed

comparable to the chaotic band merging sequence. We discuss the nature of the
Central Limit Theorem for deterministic variables.

inertial effects and the study of the non-relativistic limit) in Minkowski
space-time, of parametrized Minkowski theories and of the rest-frame instant
form of dynamics for isolated systems admitting a Lagrangian description. The
relevance and gauge equivalence of the clock synchronization conventions for
the identification of the instantaneous 3-spaces (Euclidean only in inertial
frames) are described. Then this formalism is applied to tetrad gravity in
globally hyperbolic, asymptotically Minkowskian space-times without
super-translations, where the equivalence principle implies the absence of
global inertial frames. The recently discovered York canonical basis,
diagonalizing the York-Lichnerowicz approach, allows to identify the gauge
variables (inertial effects in general relativity) and the tidal ones (the
gravitational waves of the linearized theory) and to clarify the meaning of the
Hamilton equations. The role of the gauge variable ${}^3K$, the trace of the
extrinsic curvature of the non-Euclidean 3-space (the York time not existing in
Newton theory), as a source of inertial effects is emphasized. After the
presentation of preliminary results on the linearization of tetrad gravity in
the family of non-harmonic 3-orthogonal gauges with a free value of ${}^3K$, we
define post-Minkowskian gravitational waves (without post-Newtonian
approximations on the matter sources) propagating in a non-Euclidean 3-space,
emphasizing the non-graviton-like aspects of gravity. It is conjectured that
dark matter may be explained as a relativistic inertial effect induced by
${}^3K$: it would simulate the need to choose a privileged gauge connected with
the observational conventions for the description of matter.

practical method to modify nuclear potentials so as to reduce computational
requirements for calculations of observables. The key feature of SRG
transformations that leads to computational benefits is the decoupling of
low-energy nuclear physics from high-energy details of the inter-nucleon
interaction. We examine decoupling quantitatively for two-body observables and
few-body binding energies. The universal nature of this decoupling is
illustrated and errors from suppressing high-momentum modes above the
decoupling scale are shown to be perturbatively small. To explore the SRG
evolution of many-body forces, we use as a laboratory a one-dimensional system
of bosons with short-range repulsion and mid-range attraction, which emulates
realistic nuclear forces. The free-space SRG is implemented for few-body
systems in a symmetrized harmonic oscillator basis using a recursive
construction analogous to no-core shell model implementations. Building on
one-dimensional results we performed the first practical evolution of
three-dimensional many-body forces within the No-Core Shell Model basis.
Results for the 3H binding energy are consistent with previous calculations
involving momentum-space evolution of only two-body forces, and validate
expectations from calculations in the one-dimensional oscillator basis. When
applied to 4He calculations, the two- and three-body oscillator matrix elements
yield rapid convergence of the ground-state energy with a small net
contribution of the induced four-body force. The radius of light nuclei is also
explored in the three-dimensional basis.

Following our previous work (Horak & Karas 2006a,b) we assume that scattering
of ambient light takes place in a cloud that is in radial motion under a
combined influence of black hole gravity and the radiation field. The
retro-lensed photons give rise to peaks in the observed signal that follow with
a characteristic time lag after the direct-image photons. Duration of these
features is very short and the predicted polarization varies abruptly on the
time-scale comparable with the light-crossing time of the system -- a signature
of the photon orbit. We also consider the polarization properties of scattered
light.
