of a factorization theorem based on Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) for
jet shapes in e+e- collisions. We consider measuring jet observables in
exclusive multijet final states defined with cone and k_T-type jet algorithms.
Consistency of the factorization theorem requires that the renormalization
group evolution of hard, jet, and soft functions is such that the physical
cross-section is independent of the factorization scale mu. The anomalous
dimensions of the various factorized pieces, however, depend on the color
representation of jets, choice of jet observable, the number of jets whose
shapes are measured, and the jet algorithm, making it highly nontrivial to
satisfy the consistency condition. We demonstrate the intricate cancellations
between anomalous dimensions that occur at the NLL level, so that, up to power
corrections that we identify, our factorization of the jet shape distributions
is consistent for any number of quark and gluon jets, for any number of jets
whose shapes are measured or unmeasured, for any angular size R of the jets,
and for any of the algorithms we consider. Corrections to these results are
suppressed by the SCET expansion parameter lambda (the ratio of soft to
collinear or collinear to hard scales) and in the jet separation measure 1/t^2
= tan^2(R/2)/tan^2(psi/2), where psi is the angular separation between jets.
Our results can be used to calculate a wide variety of jet observables in
multijet final states to NLL accuracy.

also find that an exact scale-invariant power spectrum is disfavored by the

theoretically-motivated power law spectral index prior. The reconstruction
shows that better data are crucial to justify the adoption of such a strong
theoretical prior observationally. These results can be used to determine the

the four-dimensional (4D) Yukawa-type function $e^{-mr}/r$ with $m \simeq

with the Yukawa-type gluon propagator, we derive analytical expressions for the
zero-spatial-momentum propagator $D_0(t)$, the effective mass $M_{\rm eff}(t)$,

Inverse Problems. Inverse problems are those where a set of measured data is
analysed in order to get as much information as possible on a model which is
assumed to represent a system in the real world. We study two inverse problems
in the fields of classical and quantum physics: QCD condensates from tau-decay
data and the inverse conductivity problem. We use a functional method which
allows us to extract within rather general assumptions phenomenological
parameters of QCD (the condensates) from a comparison of the time-like
experimental data with asymptotic space-like results from theory. The price to
be paid for the generality of assumptions is relatively large errors in the
values of the extracted parameters. Although we do not claim that our method is
superior to other approaches, we hope that our results lend additional
confidence to the numerical results obtained with the help of methods based on
QCD sum rules. In this thesis, also two approaches of EIT image reconstruction
are proposed. The first is based on reformulating the inverse problem in terms
of integral equations. This method uses only a single set of measurements for
the reconstruction. The second approach is an algorithm based on linearisation
which uses more then one set of measurements. A promising result is that one
can qualitatively reconstruct the conductivity inside the cross-section of a
human chest. Even though the human volunteer is neither two-dimensional nor
circular, such reconstructions can be useful in medical applications:
monitoring for lung problems such as accumulating fluid or a collapsed lung and
noninvasive monitoring of heart function and blood flow.

atomic features. NGC 4051 displays a strong excess over a power-law at energies
above 20 keV, some fraction of which also appears to vary with the power-law
continuum. The fast-timescale power spectrum has a shape consistent with
previous determinations, but significant differences are found between the low
and high flux states of the source, demonstrating that the power spectrum is
non-stationary. Frequency-dependent time lags between the hard and soft bands
of up to 970+/-225s are measured. The existence of the observed lags excludes
the possibility that the hard spectral component originates as reflection from
the inner accretion disk. We instead show that the frequency- and
energy-dependent time lags may be explained as reverberation, caused by
reflection from a thick shell of material with maximum lags of about 10,000s.
If the reflecting material surrounds the AGN, it extends to a distance about
1.5x10^14 cm, 600 gravitational radii, from the illuminating source and the
global covering factor is C(g) >~ 0.4, confirming suggestions that type I AGN
have high covering factors of absorbing and reflecting material. Given the
spectral and timing similarities with other type I AGN, we infer that this
structure is common in the type I population. [abridged]

probability densities, radial distribution functions and potentials of mean
force from sampled data in a statistically controlled fashion is presented. The
approach is general and can be applied to any density of a single random
variable. The method outlined here avoids the use of histograms, which require
the specification of a physical parameter (bin size) and tend to give noisy
results. The technique is an extension of the Berg-Harris method [B.A. Berg and
R.C. Harris, Comp. Phys. Comm. 179, 443 (2008)], which is typically inaccurate
for radial distribution functions and potentials of mean force due to a
non-uniform Jacobian factor. In addition, the standard method often requires a
large number of Fourier modes to represent radial distribution functions, which
tends to lead to oscillatory fits. It is shown that the issues of poor sampling
due to a Jacobian factor can be resolved using a biased resampling scheme,
while the requirement of a large number of Fourier modes is mitigated through
an automated piecewise construction approach. The method is demonstrated by
analyzing the radial distribution functions in an energy-discretized water
model. In addition, the fitting procedure is illustrated on three more
applications for which the original Berg-Harris method is not suitable, namely,
a random variable with a discontinuous probability density, a density with long
tails, and the distribution of the first arrival times of a diffusing particle
to a sphere, which has both long tails and short-time structure. In all cases,
the resampled, piecewise analytical fit outperforms the histogram and the
original Berg-Harris method.

critical behavior strongly depend on the choice of couplings, such as the order

for the vector field, $V(A^2)$. In particular it is demonstrated that theories

shown that in this class of models, the cosmological dynamics always dilutes
the vector field. In the case of a nonminimal coupling to gravity, it is
established that theories involving $R f(A^2)$ or $Rf(F^2)$ are generically
pathologic. To finish, we exhibit a model where the vector field is not diluted

Fermi velocity, $v_{F}$, has a value that differs from the one in the

accross different media, there are boundary conditions that must be satisfied,
giving rise to Snell's-like laws. We find that the transmission through a
velocity barrier is highly anisotropic, and that perfect transmission always
occurs at normal incidence. When $v_{F}$ in the barrier is larger that the
velocity outside the barrier, we find that a critical transmission angle
exists, a Brewster-like angle for massless Dirac electrons.

that the cell speed depends only weakly on the adhesive properties of the

make testable predictions. We also extend our model to include a flexible

from the NEWFIRM Medium Band Survey. The sample is selected at a constant
number density of n=2x10^-4 Mpc^-3, so that galaxies at different epochs can be
compared in a meaningful way. We show that the stellar mass of galaxies at this
number density has increased by a factor of ~2 since z=2, following the
relation log(M)=11.45-0.15z. In order to determine at what physical radii this
mass growth occurred we construct very deep stacked rest-frame R-band images at
redshifts z=0.6, 1.1, 1.6, and 2.0. These image stacks of typically 70-80
galaxies enable us to characterize the stellar distribution to surface
brightness limits of ~28.5 mag/arcsec^2. We find that massive galaxies
gradually built up their outer regions over the past 10 Gyr. The mass within a
radius of r=5 kpc is nearly constant with redshift whereas the mass at 5-75 kpc
has increased by a factor of ~4 since z=2. Parameterizing the surface
brightness profiles we find that the effective radius and Sersic n parameter
evolve as r_e~(1+z)^-1.3 and n~(1+z)^-1.0 respectively. The data demonstrate
that massive galaxies have grown mostly inside-out, assembling their extended
stellar halos around compact, dense cores with possibly exponential radial
density distributions. Comparing the observed mass evolution to the average
star formation rates of the galaxies we find that the growth is likely
dominated by mergers, as in-situ star formation can only account for ~20% of
the mass build-up from z=2 to z=0. The main uncertainties in this study are
possible redshift-dependent systematic errors in the total stellar masses and
the conversion from light-weighted to mass-weighted radial profiles.

observationally-constrained prescriptions for galactic outflows. If these
simulated winds accurately represent winds in the real Universe, then material
previously ejected in winds provides the dominant source of gas infall for new
star formation at redshifts z<1. This recycled wind accretion, or wind mode,
provides a third physically distinct accretion channel in addition to the ""hot""
and ""cold"" modes emphasised in recent theoretical studies. Because of the
interaction between outflows and gas in and around halos, the recycling
timescale of wind material (t_rec) is shorter in higher-mass systems, which
reside in denser gaseous environments. In these simulations, this differential
recycling plays a central role in shaping the present-day galaxy stellar mass
function (GSMF). If we remove all particles that were ever ejected in a wind,
then the predicted GSMFs are much steeper than observed; galaxy masses are
suppressed both by the direct removal of gas and by the hydrodynamic heating of
their surroundings, which reduces subsequent infall. With wind recycling
included, the simulation that incorporates our favoured momentum-driven wind
scalings reproduces the observed GSMF for stellar masses 10^9 < M < 5x10^10
Msolar. At higher masses, wind recycling leads to excessive galaxy masses and
excessive star formation rates relative to observations. In these massive
systems, some quenching mechanism must suppress the re-accretion of gas ejected
from star-forming galaxies. In short, as has long been anticipated, the form of
the GSMF is governed by outflows; the unexpected twist here for our simulated
winds is that it is not primarily the ejection of material but how the ejected
material is re-accreted that governs the GSMF.

nonextensivity-induced correlation, by using the multivariate $q$-Gaussian
probability distribution function (PDF) for $N$-unit independent nonextensive
systems. The Tsallis entropy is shown to be expressed by $S_q^{(N)} =
S_{q,FA}^{(N)}+ \Delta S_q^{(N)}$ where $q$ denotes the entropic index,
$S_{q,FA}^{(N)}$ a contribution in the FA, and $\Delta S_q^{(N)}$ a correction
term. It is pointed out that the correction term of $\Delta S_q^{(N)}$ is
considerable for large $| q-1 |$ and/or large $N$ because the multivariate PDF
cannot be expressed by the factorized form which is assumed in the FA. This
implies that the pseudoadditivity of the Tsallis entropy, which is obtained
with PDFs in the FA, does not hold although it is commonly postulated in the
literatures. We have calculated correlations defined by $C_m= < (\delta x_i
\:\delta x_j)^m >_q -< (\delta x_i)^m >_q\: < (\delta x_j)^m >_q$ for $i \neq
j$, where $\delta x_i=x_i -< x_i >_q$ and $<\cdot >_q$ stands for $q$-average
over the escort PDF. It has been shown that $C_1$ expresses the intrinsic
correlation and that $C_m$ with $m \geq 2$ signifies correlation induced by
nonextensivity whose physical origin is elucidated within the superstatistics.
PDFs calculated for the classical ideal gas and harmonic oscillator are

topological levels, from high-energy, generic ones, in the ""entanglement
spectrum"" of Fractional Quantum Hall (FQH) states. By removing the magnetic
length inherent in the FQH problem - a procedure which we call taking the
""conformal limit"", we find that the entanglement spectrum of an incompressible
ground-state of a generic (i.e. Coulomb) lowest Landau Level Hamiltonian
re-arranges into a low-(entanglement) energy part separated by a full gap from
the high energy entanglement levels. As previously observed, the counting of
these levels starts off as the counting of modes of the edge theory of the FQH
state, but quickly develops finite-size effects which we show can also serve as
a fingerprint of the FQH state. As the sphere manifold where the FQH resides
grows, the level spacing of the states at the same angular momentum goes to
zero, suggestive of the presence of relativistic gapless edge-states. By using
the adiabatic continuity of the low entanglement energy levels, we investigate
whether two states are topologically connected.

profile derived from observations of Jupiter is non-Gaussian and indeed
extends, in the W band for example, well beyond its 12.'6 FWHM core out to more
than 1 degree in radius. This means that even though the core width corresponds
to wavenumber l\approx1800, the form of the beam still significantly affects
the WMAP results even at l\approx200 which is the scale of the first acoustic
peak. The difference between the beam convolved C_l and the final C_l is
\approx70% at the scale of the first peak, rising to \approx400% at the scale
of the second.
  New estimates of the Q, V and W-band beam profiles are then presented, based
on a stacking analysis of the WMAP5 radio source catalogue and temperature
maps. The radio sources show a significantly (3-4\sigma) broader beam profile
on scales of 10'-30' than that found by the WMAP team whose beam analysis is
based on measurements of Jupiter. Beyond these scales the beam profiles from
the radio sources are too noisy to give useful information. Furthermore, we
find tentative evidence for a non-linear relation between WMAP and ATCA/IRAM 95
GHz source fluxes. We discuss whether the wide beam profiles could be caused
either by radio source extension or clustering and find that neither
explanation is likely. We also argue against the possibility that Eddington
bias is affecting our results. The reasons for the difference between the radio
source and the Jupiter beam profiles are therefore still unclear. If the radio
source profiles were then used to define the WMAP beam, there could be a
significant change in the amplitude and position of even the first acoustic
peak. It is therefore important to identify the reasons for the differences
between these two beam profile estimates.

These oscillations become stronger as the gap size is decreased, and the stress

curves show shear thickening that retains bulk behavior down to samples as thin

the smaller axis.) The structure of the graph of $c(a)$ is surprisingly rich.
The volume constraint implies that $c(a)$ is always greater than or equal to
the square root of $a$, and it is not hard to see that this is equality for
large $a$. However, for $a$ less than the fourth power $\tau^4$ of the golden
ratio, $c(a)$ is piecewise linear, with graph that alternately lies on a line
through the origin and is horizontal. We prove this by showing that there are
exceptional curves in blow ups of the complex projective plane whose homology
classes are given by the continued fraction expansions of ratios of Fibonacci
numbers. On the interval $[\tau^4,7]$ we find $c(a)=(a+1)/3$. For $a \ge 7$,
the function $c(a)$ coincides with the square root except on a finite number of
intervals where it is again piecewise linear.
  The embedding constraints coming from embedded contact homology give rise to
another capacity function $c_{ECH}$ which may be computed by counting lattice
points in appropriate right angled triangles. According to Hutchings and
Taubes, the functorial properties of embedded contact homology imply that
$c_{ECH}(a) \le c(a)$ for all $a$. We show here that $c_{ECH}(a) \ge c(a)$ for

constraints on theories of quantized spacetime foam at the Planckian level. We
discuss the geometry of foamy spacetime, and the appropriate distance measure

and the constraints they put on spacetime foam models. While time lags from
distant pulsed sources such as GRBs have been posited as a possible test of
spacetime foam models, we demonstrate that the time-lag effect is rather
smaller than has been calculated, due to the equal probability of positive and
negative fluctuations in the speed of light inherent in such models. Thus far,
images of high-redshift quasars from the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (UDF) provide
the most stringent test of spacetime foam theories. While random walk models
($\alpha = 1/2$) have already been ruled out, the holographic ($\alpha=2/3$)
model remains viable. Here $\alpha \sim 1$ parametrizes the different spacetime
foam models according to which the fluctuation of a distance $l$ is given by
$\sim l^{1 - \alpha} l_P^{\alpha}$ with $l_P$ being the Planck length. Indeed,
we see a slight wavelength-dependent blurring in the UDF images selected for

indicate the existence of a bound supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary where
two distinct broad line regions (BLRs) contribute together to the line profile.
An alternative interpretation is a disk emitter origin for the double-peaked
line profile. Using simple BLR models, we calculate the expected broad line
profile for a SMBH binary at different separations. Under reasonable
assumptions that both BLRs are illuminated by the two active SMBHs and that the
ionizing flux at the BLR location is roughly constant, we confirm the emergence
of double-peaked features and radial velocity drifts of the two peaks due to
the binary orbital motion. However, such a clear double-peaked feature only
arises in a particular stage of the binary evolution when the two BHs are close
enough such that the line-of-sight orbital velocity difference is larger than
the FWHM of the individual broad components, while the two BLRs are still
mostly distinct. Prior to this stage, the velocity splitting due to the orbit
motion of the binary is too small to separate the emission from the two BLRs,
leading to asymmetric broad line profiles in general. When the two BHs are even
closer such that the two BLRs can no longer be distinct, the line profile
becomes more complex and the splitting of the peaks does not correspond to the
orbital motion of the binary. In this regime there are no coherent radial
velocity drifts in the peaks with time. Asymmetric line profiles are probably a
far more common signature of binary SMBHs than are double-peaked profiles. We
discuss the temporal variations of the broad line profile for binary SMBHs and
highlight the different behaviors of reverberation mapping in the binary and
disk emitter cases, which may serve as a feasible tool to disentangle these two
scenarios.

of dynamical systems to select the better behaved models, with appropriate
attractors in the past and future. The second class of tools is rather
physical: the use of astrophysical observations to crack the degeneracy of
classes of dark energy models. In this last case the observations related with
structure formation are emphasized both in the linear and non-linear regimes.
We exemplify several studies based on our research, such as quintom and
quinstant dark energy ones. Quintom dark energy paradigm is a hybrid
construction of quintessence and phantom fields, which does not suffer from
fine-tuning problems associated to phantom field and additionally it preserves
the scaling behavior of quintessence. Quintom dark energy is motivated on
theoretical grounds as an explanation for the crossing of the phantom divide,
i.e. the smooth crossing of the dark energy state equation parameter below the
value -1. On the other hand, quinstant dark energy is considered to be formed
by quintessence and a negative cosmological constant, the inclusion of this
later component allows for a viable mechanism to halt acceleration. We comment
that the quinstant dark energy scenario gives good predictions for structure
formation in the linear regime, but fails to do that in the non-linear one, for
redshifts larger than one. We comment that there might still be some degree of
arbitrariness in the selection of the best dark energy models.

galaxy NGC 4051 and present the results of a cross-correlation study using
X-ray and optical light curves spanning more than 12 years. The emission is
highly variable in all wavebands, and the amplitude of the optical variations
is found to be smaller than that of the X-rays, even after correcting for the
contaminating host galaxy flux falling inside the photometric aperture. The
optical power spectrum is best described by an unbroken power law model with
slope $\alpha=1.4^{+0.6}_{-0.2}$ and displays lower variability power than the
2-10 keV X-rays on all time-scales probed. We find the light curves to be
significantly correlated at an optical delay of $1.2^{+1.0}_{-0.3}$ days behind
the X-rays. This time-scale is consistent with the light travel time to the
optical emitting region of the accretion disc, suggesting that the optical
variations are driven by X-ray reprocessing. We show, however, that a model
whereby the optical variations arise from reprocessing by a flat accretion disc
cannot account for all the optical variability. There is also a second
significant peak in the cross-correlation function, at an optical delay of
$39^{+2.7}_{-8.4}$ days. The lag is consistent with the dust sublimation radius
in this source, suggesting that there is a measurable amount of optical flux
coming from the dust torus. We discuss the origin of the additional optical
flux in terms of reprocessing of X-rays and reflection of optical light by the
dust.

hot bipolar bubbles inflated by AGN jets observed in the radio as Perseus A. It
presents a spectacular $H{\alpha}$-emitting nebulosity surrounding NGC1275,
with loops and filaments of gas extending to over 50 kpc. The origin of the
filaments is still unknown, but probably correlates with the mechanism
responsible for the giant buoyant bubbles. We present 2.5 and 3-dimensional MHD
simulations of the central region of the cluster in which turbulent energy,
possibly triggered by star formation and supernovae (SNe) explosions is
introduced. The simulations reveal that the turbulence injected by massive
stars could be responsible for the nearly isotropic distribution of filaments
and loops that drag magnetic fields upward as indicated by recent observations.
Weak shell-like shock fronts propagating into the ICM with velocities of
100-500 km/s are found, also resembling the observations. The isotropic outflow
momentum of the turbulence slows the infall of the intracluster medium, thus
limiting further starburst activity in NGC1275. As the turbulence is subsonic
over most of the simulated volume, the turbulent kinetic energy is not
efficiently converted into heat and additional heating is required to suppress
the cooling flow at the core of the cluster. Simulations combining the MHD
turbulence with the AGN outflow can reproduce the temperature radial profile
observed around NGC1275. While the AGN mechanism is the main heating source,
the supernovae are crucial to isotropize the energy distribution.

of the modular system could additionally be improved using dedicated file

radiation emitted from the AGN central engine: (i) outflows driven from the
innermost part of an accretion disk and (2) outflows driven from a large-scale
inflow that is likely the main supplier of material to the central engine. We
discuss the relevance of both types of outflows to the so-called AGN feedback
problem. However, the AGN feedback should not be considered separately from the
AGN physics. Therefore, we also discuss the issue whether the properties of the
same outflows are consistent with the gas properties in broad- and narrow-line
regions.

formulas that is hard for one of the simplest proof systems, tree resolution,
into formulas that require large rank in any proof system that manipulates
polynomials or polynomial threshold functions of degree at most k (known as
Th(k) proofs). Such systems include Lovasz-Schrijver and Cutting Planes proof
systems as well as their high degree analogues.
  These are based on analyzing two new proof systems, denoted by T^cc(k) and
R^cc(k). The proof lines of T^cc(k) are arbitrary Boolean functions, each of
which can be evaluated by an efficient k-party randomized communication
protocol. They include Th{k-1} proofs as a special case. R^cc(k) proofs are
stronger and only require that each inference be locally checkable by an
efficient k-party randomized communication protocol.
  Our main results are the following:
  (1) When k is O(loglogn), for any unsatisfiable CNF formula F requiring
resolution rank r, there is a related CNF formula G=Lift_k(F) requiring
refutation rank r^Omega(1/k) log^O(1) n in all R^cc(k) systems.
  (2) There are strict hierarchies for T^cc(k) and R^cc(k) systems with respect
to k when k is O(loglogn in that there are unsatisfiable CNF formulas requiring
large rank R^cc(k) refutations but having log^O(1) n rank Th(k) refutations.
  (3) When k is O(loglogn) there are 2^(n^Omega(1/k)) lower bounds on the size
of tree-like T^cc(k) refutations for large classes of lifted CNF formulas.
  (4) A general method for producing integrality gaps for low rank R^cc(2)

(CDM3Y$n$ and M3Y-P$n$) have been probed against the bulk properties of
asymmetric nuclear matter (NM) in the nonrelativistic Hartree Fock (HF)
formalism. The same HF study has also been done with the famous Skyrme (SLy4)
and Gogny (D1S and D1N) interactions which were well tested in the nuclear
structure calculations. Our HF results are compared with those given by other
many-body calculations like the Dirac-Brueckner Hartree-Fock approach or
ab-initio variational calculation using free nucleon-nucleon interaction, and
by both the nonrelativistic and relativistic mean-field studies using different
model parameters. Although the two considered density-dependent versions of the
M3Y interaction were proven to be quite realistic in the nuclear structure or
reaction studies, they give two distinct behaviors of the NM symmetry energy at
high densities, like the Asy-soft and Asy-stiff scenarios found earlier with
other mean-field interactions. As a consequence, we obtain two different
behaviors of the proton fraction in the $\beta$-equilibrium which in turn can
imply two drastically different mechanisms for the neutron star cooling. While
some preference of the Asy-stiff scenario was found based on predictions of the
latest microscopic many-body calculations or empirical NM pressure and isospin
diffusion data deduced from heavy-ion collisions, a consistent mean-field
description of nuclear structure database is more often given by some Asy-soft

interesting challenge to the modern mean-field approaches.

We show via a non-trivial extension of this semigroup approach that the natural

desire to provide an information-theoretic foundation for compound Poisson
approximation and associated limit theorems, analogous to the corresponding
developments for the central limit theorem and for Poisson approximation. Our
results also demonstrate new links between some probabilistic methods and the

confinement effects. Due to the microscopic nature of these effects, a
microscopic theory of absorption and transport is required for their
quantification. Such a theory can be developed in the framework of the
non-equilibrium Green's function approach to semiconductor quantum transport
and quantum optics. In this paper, the theory is used to numerically
investigate the density of states, non-equilibrium occupation and corresponding
excess concentration of both electrons and holes in single quantum well
structures embedded in the intrinsic region of a p-i-n semiconductor diode,
under illumination with monochromatic light of different energies. Escape of
carriers from the quantum well is considered via the inspection of the spectral
photocurrent at a given excitation energy. The investigation shows that escape
from deep levels may be inefficient even at room temperature.

In particular it contains a combinatorial construction of the blowing up of a

that over an algebraically closed base field of zero characteristic the
Semple-Nash modification of a general toric variety is isomorphic to the
blowing up of the sheaf of logarithmic jacobian ideals and that in any

the coefficients, which depend on the density. This new feature may lead to the
loss of hyperbolicity in some regimes. We provide then a general method which
enables us to get asymptotic expansions of these coefficients. These expansions
shows, in some effective situations, that the system is not hyperbolic. This
asymptotic study is also useful to measure the influence of the angle of vision

carries traffic during normal operation is called as primary path. The traffic
is rerouted on a backup path in case of a failure. In this paper we propose to
design a reliable and fault tolerant routing algorithm for establishing primary

load balancing in which link cost metrics are estimated based on the current
load of the links. In backup path setup, the source calculates the blocking
probability through the received feedback from the destination by sending a
small fraction of probe packets along the existing paths. It then selects the
optimal light path with the lowest blocking probability. Based on the
simulation results, we show that the reliable and fault tolerant routing
algorithm reduces the blocking probability and latency while increasing the
throughput and channel utilization.

The resulting global schema provides a uniform interface and high level of

A set of integration operators are defined to integrate local schemas based on

the lens galaxies in these systems are unusually often accompanied by luminous

in excess of background counts, as a function of satellite brightness and
separation from the primary object. We find that the incidence of luminous

satellites of a few tenths of the primary flux, comparable to what is observed
for the wider but shallower SDSS survey. Although the environments of lenses in

the conclusion from previous works that seeders have a significant impact on

availability, (ii) 23.5% of nodes that operate in seedless torrents can finish
their downloads, and (iii) BitTorrent availability is discontinuous, operating
in cycles of temporary unavailability. Due to our new findings, we consider it

approach to model fluids in astrophysical problems, thanks to its geometric

inaccuracies of SPH in the treatment of fluid instabilities. The origin of
these numerical problems can be traced back to spurious surface effects across
contact discontinuities, and to SPH's inherent prevention of mixing at the
particle level. We here investigate a new fluid particle model where the
density estimate is carried out with the help of an auxiliary mesh constructed
as the Voronoi tessellation of the simulation particles instead of an adaptive
smoothing kernel. This Voronoi-based approach improves the ability of the
scheme to represent sharp contact discontinuities. We show that this eliminates
spurious surface tension effects present in SPH and that play a role in
suppressing certain fluid instabilities. We find that the new `Voronoi Particle
Hydrodynamics' described here produces comparable results than SPH in shocks,
and better ones in turbulent regimes of pure hydrodynamical simulations. We
also discuss formulations of the artificial viscosity needed in this scheme and
how judiciously chosen correction forces can be derived in order to maintain a
high degree of particle order and hence a regular Voronoi mesh. This is
especially helpful in simulating self-gravitating fluids with existing gravity

Our method demonstrates a beautiful link between the random convex hull problem

$n$ independent planar Brownian trajectories for which we compute exactly, for

For radii exterior to a kpc, tilted ring orientations lie on an arc on a polar

merger can account for the ring morphology. Three kinks in the ring
orientations are seen on the polar plot, the one at radius of about 1.3 kpc we
suspect corresponds to the location where self-gravity in the disk affects the
ring precession rate. Another at a radius of about 600 pc may be associated
with a gap in the gas distribution. A third kink is seen at a radius of 100 pc.
A constant inclination tilted disk precessing about the jet axis may describe
the disk between 100 and 20 pc but not interior to this. A model with disk
orientation matching the molecular circumnuclear disk at 100 pc that decays at

oscillations in position, and the trajectories of two persons meeting in a
corridor in opposite direction will be far from realistic and somewhat erratic.
This is inpart due to the assumption of instantaneous reaction on the momentary
situation. Obviously, persons react with a small time lag, while on the other
hand they will anticipate changing situations for at least a short time. Thus
basing the repulsive interaction on a (linear) extrapolation over a short time
(e.g. 1 s) eliminates the oscillations at slowing down and smoothes the
patterns of giving way to others to a more realistic behavior. A second problem
is the additive combination of binary interactions. It is shown that combining
only a few relevant interactions gives better model performance.

The evolution of the space velocity field for F and G dwarfs has been traced as
a function of the stellar age. We have managed to confirm the existence of the
recently discovered KFR08 stream. We have found 19 Hipparcos stars, candidates
for membership in the KFR08 stream, and obtained an isochrone age estimate for
the stream, 13 Gyr. The mean stellar ages of the Wolf 630-alpha Ceti and
Hercules streams are shown to be comparable, 4--6 Gyr. No significant
differences in the metallicities of stars belonging to these streams have been
found. This is an argument for the hypothesis that these streams owe their
origin to a common mechanism.

the bosonic case, the cost of simulations depends on the amount of entanglement
in the ground state and not directly on the strength of interactions. The
present formulation of fermionic PEPS leads to a straightforward numerical
implementation that allowed us to recycle much of the code for bosonic PEPS. We
demonstrate that fermionic PEPS are a useful variational ansatz for interacting
fermion systems by computing approximations to the ground state of several
models on an infinite lattice. For a model of interacting spinless fermions,
ground state energies lower than Hartree-Fock results are obtained, shifting
the boundary between the metal and charge-density wave phases. For the t-J

consequences of our method, we have: (1) Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are

into the surrounding star field. The time scale for complete disintegration
depends both on their initial membership and location within the Galaxy. Open
clusters undergoing the terminal phase of cluster disruption or open cluster
remnants (OCRs) are notoriously difficult to identify. From an observational
point, a combination of low number statistics and minimal contrast against the
general stellar field conspire to turn them into very challenging objects. To
make the situation even worst, random samples of field stars often display
features that may induce to classify them erroneously as extremely evolved open
clusters. In this paper, we provide a detailed study of the stellar content and
kinematics of NGC 6863, a compact group of a few stars located in Aquila and
described by the POSS as a non existent cluster. Nonetheless, this object has
been recently classified as OCR. The aim of the present work is to either
confirm or disprove its OCR status by a detailed star-by-star analysis. The
analysis is performed using wide-field photometry in the UBVI pass-band, proper
motions from the UCAC3 catalogue, and high resolution spectroscopy as well as
results from extensive $N$-body calculations. Our results show that the four
brightest stars commonly associated to NGC 6863 form an asterism, a group of
non-physically associated stars projected together, leading to the conclusion
that NGC 6863 is not a real open cluster.

unitarysymplectic rotation symmetry are more complicated to calculate than in
the unitary case. The supersymmetry method and the orthogonal polynomials are
two techniques to tackle this task. Recently, we presented a new method to
average ratios of characteristic polynomials over matrix ensembles invariant
under the unitary group. Here, we extend this approach to ensembles with
orthogonal and unitary-symplectic rotation symmetry. We show that Pfaffian
structures can be derived for a wide class of orthogonal and unitary-symplectic
rotation invariant ensembles in a unifying way. This includes also those for
which this structure was not known previously, as the real Ginibre ensemble and
the Gaussian real chiral ensemble with two independent matrices as well.

behavior of clustering instability in a freely cooling dilute granular gas in
two dimensions. We find that, in circular containers, the homogeneous cooling
state (HCS) of the gas loses its stability via a sub-critical pitchfork
bifurcation. There are no time-independent solutions for the gas density in the
supercritical region, and we present analytical and numerical evidence that the
gas develops thermal collapse unarrested by heat diffusion. To get more
insight, we switch to a simpler geometry of a narrow-sector-shaped container.
Here the HCS loses its stability via a transcritical bifurcation. For some
initial conditions a time-independent inhomogeneous density profile sets in,
qualitatively similar to that previously found in a narrow-channel geometry.
For other initial conditions, however, the dilute gas develops thermal collapse
unarrested by heat diffusion. We determine the dynamic scalings of the flow
close to collapse analytically and verify them in hydrodynamic simulations. The
results of this work imply that, in dimension higher than one, Navier-Stokes
hydrodynamics of a dilute granular gas is prone to finite-time density blowups.
This provides a natural explanation to the formation of densely packed clusters
of particles in a variety of initially dilute granular flows.

the line modelling and reported fast outflows in the circumnuclear gas. Here,
we use the line fluxes to investigate the physical conditions and dominant
ionisation mechanisms of the emission line gas. We find evidence for large
electron densities and high reddening in the nuclear regions, particularly in
the broader, blueshifted components. These results are consistent with the idea
that the young, recently triggered radio sources still reside in dense and
dusty cocoons deposited by the recent activity triggering event. In addition,
we find that the quiescent nuclear and extended narrow components are
consistent with AGN photoionisation. For the nuclear broader and shifted
components the results are less clear. Whilst there are suggestions that the
broader components may be closer to shock plus precursor models on the
diagnostic diagrams (with high electron temperatures and densities), we are
unable to unambiguously distinguish the dominant ionisation mechanism using the
optical emission line ratios. This is surprising given the strong evidence for
jet-cloud interactions (broad emission lines, large outflow velocities and
strong radio-optical alignments), which favours the idea that the warm gas has
been accelerated in shocks driven by the radio lobes expanding through a dense
cocoon of gas deposited during the triggering event.

extended resonant states and the localized ones, as well as an elusive regime
of virtual states. This last appears when the resonance width collapses and
before it becomes a localized state. Contrary to common wisdom, the highest
excitation transfer does not occur when the system has a well defined extended
resonant state but just at the virtual-localized transition, where the main
plasmonic modes have eigenfrequencies at the passband edge. The slow group
velocity at this critical frequency enables the excitation buffering and hence
favors a strong signal inside the chain. A similar situation should appear in
many other physical systems. The extreme sensitivity of this transition to the
waveguide and LE-NP parameters provides new tools for plasmonics.

constant (CC) problem in a class of F(R,G) models of modified gravity. For a CC
of arbitrary size and sign the corresponding cosmological evolution follows an
expansion history which strikingly resembles that of our real universe. The
effects of the large CC are relaxed dynamically and there is no fine-tuning at
any stage. In addition, the relaxation mechanism alleviates the coincidence
problem. The upshot is that a large cosmological constant and the observed
cosmic expansion history coexist peacefully in the Relaxed Universe. This model
universe can be thought of as an interesting preliminary solution of the
cosmological constant problem, in the sense that it provides a successful
dynamical mechanism able to completely avoid the fine-tuning problem (the
toughest aspect of the CC problem). However, since the Relaxed Universe is
formulated within the context of modified gravity, it may still suffer of some
of the known issues associated with these theories, and therefore it can be

2. In this note we compute all the braided monoidal structures on the category
of $k$-vector spaces graded by the Klein group $C_2\times C_2$. Actually, for
the monoidal structures we will compute the explicit form of the 3-cocycles on
$C_2\times C_2$ with coefficients in $k^*$, while for the braided monoidal
structures we will compute the explicit form of the abelian 3-cocycles on
$C_2\times C_2$ with coefficients in $k^*$. In particular, this will allow us
to produce examples of quasi-Hopf algebras and weak braided Hopf algebras, out
of the vector space $k[C_2\times C_2]$.

  Partitions and Exploring Data Graphs Locally","24 pages. Completely rewritten; substance is still the same, but the
  presentation is reworked",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The second eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix and its associated eigenvector
are fundamental features of an undirected graph, and as such they have found
widespread use in scientific computing, machine learning, and data analysis. In
many applications, however, graphs that arise have several \emph{local} regions
of interest, and the second eigenvector will typically fail to provide
information fine-tuned to each local region. In this paper, we introduce a
locally-biased analogue of the second eigenvector, and we demonstrate its
usefulness at highlighting local properties of data graphs in a semi-supervised
manner. To do so, we first view the second eigenvector as the solution to a
constrained optimization problem, and we incorporate the local information as
an additional constraint; we then characterize the optimal solution to this new
problem and show that it can be interpreted as a generalization of a
Personalized PageRank vector; and finally, as a consequence, we show that the
solution can be computed in nearly-linear time. In addition, we show that this
locally-biased vector can be used to compute an approximation to the best
partition \emph{near} an input seed set in a manner analogous to the way in
which the second eigenvector of the Laplacian can be used to obtain an
approximation to the best partition in the entire input graph. Such a primitive
is useful for identifying and refining clusters locally, as it allows us to
focus on a local region of interest in a semi-supervised manner. Finally, we
provide a detailed empirical evaluation of our method by showing how it can
applied to finding locally-biased sparse cuts around an input vertex seed set
in social and information networks.

Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) fields from near-infrared spectra covering the
CaII triplet lines using the VLT + FORS2. The errors of the derived [Fe/H]
values range from 0.09 to 0.35 dex per star, with a mean of 0.17 dex. The
metallicity distribution of the whole sample shows a mean value of [Fe/H] =
-1.00 +- 0.02, with a dispersion of 0.32 +- 0.01, in agreement with global mean
[Fe/H] values found in previous studies. We find no evidence of a metallicity
gradient in the SMC. In fact, on analysing the metallicity distribution of each
field, we derived mean values of [Fe/H] = -0.99 +- 0.08 and [Fe/H] = -1.02 +-
0.07 for fields located closer and farther than 4 deg. from the center of the
galaxy, respectively. In addition, there is a clear tendency for the field
stars to be more metal-poor than the corresponding cluster they surround,
independent of their positions in the galaxy and of the clusters' age. We argue
that this most likely stems from the field stars being somewhat older and
therefore somewhat more metal-poor than most of our clusters.

  sequence",,,,,"cs.DM cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many applications in network analysis require algorithms to sample uniformly
at random from the set of all graphs with a prescribed degree sequence. We
present a Markov chain based approach which converges to the uniform
distribution of all realizations for both the directed and undirected case. It
remains an open challenge whether these Markov chains are rapidly mixing.
  For the case of directed graphs, we also explain in this paper that a popular
switching algorithm fails in general to sample uniformly at random because the
state graph of the Markov chain decomposes into different isomorphic
components. We call degree sequences for which the state graph is strongly
connected arc swap sequences. To handle arbitrary degree sequences, we develop
two different solutions. The first uses an additional operation (a
reorientation of induced directed 3-cycles) which makes the state graph
strongly connected, the second selects randomly one of the isomorphic
components and samples inside it. Our main contribution is a precise
characterization of arc swap sequences, leading to an efficient recognition
algorithm. Finally, we point out some interesting consequences for network
analysis.

quark sector. We study the possibility of detecting signals of heavy
color-octet vector resonances, through the charge asymmetry, in top-antitop+jet
events. Besides contributions with the top-antitop pair in a color-singlet
state, the asymmetry gets also contributions which are proportional to the
color factor f_{abc}^2. This process is particularly interesting for
extra-dimensional models, where the inclusive charge asymmetry generated by
Kaluza-Klein excitations of the gluon vanishes at the tree level. We find that
the statistical significance for the measurement of such an asymmetry is
sizable for different values of the coupling constants and already at low
energies.
