""anthropic"" argument against extraterrestrial life and intelligence. In
contrast to those already considered by Wilson, Livio, and others, the present
approach is based on relaxing hidden uniformitarian assumptions, considering
instead a dynamical succession of evolutionary regimes governed by both global
(Galaxy-wide) and local (planet- or planetary system-limited) regulation
mechanisms. This is in accordance with recent developments in both astrophysics
and evolutionary biology. Notably, our increased understanding of the nature of
supernovae and gamma-ray bursts, as well as of strong coupling between the
Solar System and the Galaxy on one hand, and the theories of ""punctuated
equilibria"" of Eldredge and Gould and ""macroevolutionary regimes"" of Jablonski,
Valentine, et al. on the other, are in full accordance with the regulation-
mechanism picture. The application of this particular strategy highlights the
limits of application of Carter's argument, and indicates that in the real
universe its applicability conditions are not satisfied. We conclude that
drawing far-reaching conclusions about the scarcity of extraterrestrial
intelligence and the prospects of our efforts to detect it on the basis of this
argument is unwarranted.

wind are still the subject of debate. A key obstacle in the way of producing
realistic simulations of the Sun-heliosphere system is the lack of a physically
motivated way of specifying the coronal heating rate. Recent one-dimensional
models have been found to reproduce many observed features of the solar wind by
assuming the energy comes from Alfven waves that are partially reflected, then
dissipated by magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. However, the nonlocal physics of
wave reflection has made it difficult to apply these processes to more
sophisticated (three-dimensional) models. This paper presents a set of robust
approximations to the solutions of the linear Alfven wave reflection equations.
A key ingredient to the turbulent heating rate is the ratio of inward to
outward wave power, and the approximations developed here allow this to be
written explicitly in terms of local plasma properties at any given location.
The coronal heating also depends on the frequency spectrum of Alfven waves in
the open-field corona, which has not yet been measured directly. A model-based
assumption is used here for the spectrum, but the results of future
measurements can be incorporated easily. The resulting expression for the
coronal heating rate is self-contained, computationally efficient, and
applicable directly to global models of the corona and heliosphere. This paper
tests and validates the approximations by comparing the results to exact
solutions of the wave transport equations in several cases relevant to the fast
and slow solar wind.

distributions. These are obtained via a transformation of the margins from a

light-tailed meta distribution the sample clouds, properly scaled, converge
onto a deterministic set. The shape of the limit set gives a good description
of the relation between extreme observations in different directions. This
paper investigates how sensitive the limit shape is to changes in the
underlying heavy-tailed distribution. Copulas fit in well with multivariate
extremes. By Galambos's theorem, existence of directional derivatives in the
upper endpoint of the copula is necessary and sufficient for convergence of the
multivariate extremes provided the marginal maxima converge. The copula of the
max-stable limit distribution does not depend on the margins. So margins seem
to play a subsidiary role in multivariate extremes. The theory and examples
presented in this paper cast a different light on the significance of margins.
For light-tailed meta distributions, the asymptotic behaviour is very sensitive
to perturbations of the underlying heavy-tailed original distribution, it may
change drastically even when the asymptotic behaviour of the heavy-tailed
density is not affected.

  Our main example is virtual knot theory and its simplifaction, {\em free knot
theory}. By using Gauss diagrams, we show the existence of non-trivial free
knots (counterexample to Turaev's conjecture), and construct simple and deep
invariants made out of parity. Some invariants are valued in graph-like objects
and some other are valued in groups.
  We discuss applications of parity to virtual knots and ways of extending
well-known invariants.
  The existence of a non-trivial parity for classical knots remains an open
problem.

Two additional assumptions are made: (i) the orthogonal 6-d space in any point
of the hypersurface is invariant under the orthogonal group SO(6) or one of its
subgroups, (ii) in that space only the invariant, or distinguished, subgroups
of SO(6) can be symmetry groups for the physical states. There are only two
such possibilities, each of them corresponding to one type of particles: (i)
hadrons, experiencing a gauge field associated to a real symmetry group GH(6) ,
isomorphous to SU(3) and identified with the strong interaction, and (ii)
leptons experiencing another gauge field associated with a real symmetry group
GL(6), isomorphous to SU(2)xU(1) but different from the usual electro-weak
coupling. Moreover both hadrons and leptons are subject to weak and
electromagnetic interactions plus a scalar Higgs-type coupling. That
description can be extended so as to include gravitation. Postulating a minimal
Lagrangian in the full 10-dimension space-time leads to introduce one effective
additional vector-type field, which does not act the same way upon hadrons and
leptons, thus provoking an apparent violation of the equivalence principle.

harmonic trap can be described with the lowest Landau-level set of
single-particle states. The condensate wave function psi(x,y) is a Gaussian
exp(-r^2/2), multiplied by an analytic function f(z) of the complex variable z=
x+ i y. The criterion for a quantum phase transition to a non-superfluid
correlated many-body state is usually expressed in terms of the ratio of the
number of particles to the number of vortices. Here, a similar description
applies to a rapidly rotating non-symmetric two-dimensional trap with arbitrary
quadratic anisotropy (omega_x^2 < omega_y^2). The corresponding condensate wave
function psi(x,y) is a complex anisotropic Gaussian with a phase proportional
to xy, multiplied by an analytic function f(z), where z = x + i \beta_- y is a
stretched complex variable and 0< \beta_- <1 is a real parameter that depends
on the trap anisotropy and the rotation frequency. Both in the mean-field
Thomas-Fermi approximation and in the mean-field lowest Landau level
approximation with many visible vortices, an anisotropic parabolic density
profile minimizes the energy. An elongated condensate grows along the soft trap
direction yet ultimately shrinks along the tight trap direction. The criterion
for the quantum phase transition to a correlated state is generalized (1) in
terms of N/L_z, which suggests that a non-symmetric trap should make it easier
to observe this transition or (2) in terms of a ""fragmented"" correlated state,
which suggests that a non-symmetric trap should make it harder to observe this
transition. An alternative scenario involves a crossover to a quasi
one-dimensional condensate without visible vortices, as suggested by Aftalion
et al., Phys. Rev. A 79, 011603(R) (2009).

classification of simple games outlined in the classical monograph of von
Neumann and Morgenstern (1944). One of the most fundamental questions of this
program is what makes a simple game a weighted majority game. The necessary and
sufficient conditions that guarantee weightedness were obtained by Elgot (1961)
and refined by Taylor and Zwicker (1992). If a simple game does not have
weights, then rough weights may serve as a reasonable substitute (see their use
in Taylor and Zwicker, 1992). A simple game is roughly weighted if there exists
a system of weights and a threshold such that all coalitions whose combined
weight is above the threshold are winning and all coalitions whose combined
weight is below the threshold are losing and a tie-breaking is needed to
classify the coalitions whose combined weight is exactly the threshold. Not all
simple games are roughly weighted, and the class of projective games is a prime
example.
  In this paper we give necessary and sufficient conditions for a simple game
to have rough weights. We define two functions f(n) and g(n) that measure the
deviation of a simple game from a weighted majority game and roughly weighted
majority game, respectively. We formulate known results in terms of lower and
upper bounds for these functions and improve those bounds. We also investigate
rough weightedness of simle games with a small number of players.

determined in part by the bare shear viscosity which is defined by the
averaging length lambda. This is in contrast to the usual theory which involves
the renormalized shear viscosity. An increase in gas pressure produces a
decrease in the bare shear viscosity and as a result the fall rate increases.
This behavior is opposite the Millikan Law prediction that an increase in
pressure produces a decrease in fall rate. As a result, the bare shear
viscosity is experimentally measurable by the fallrate. The theory here uses a
convective diffusion equation and a Langevin approach will be presented

$^{39}$Ar production and radiogenic $^{40}$Ar production in situ and from
external sources, we can derive the ratio of $^{39}$Ar to $^{40}$Ar in
underground sources. We show for the first time that the $^{39}$Ar production
underground is dominated by stopping negative muon capture on $^{39}$K and
($\alpha,n)$ induced subsequent $^{39}$K(n,p)$^{39}$Ar reactions. The
production of $^{39}$Ar is shown as a function of depth. We demonstrate that
argon depleted in $^{39}$Ar can be obtained only if the depth of the
underground resources is greater than 500 m.w.e. below the surface. Stopping
negative muon capture on $^{39}$K dominates over radiogenic production at
depths of less than 2000 m.w.e., and that production by muon-induced neutrons
is subdominant at any depth. The depletion factor depends strongly on both
radioactivity level and potassium content in the rock. We measure the
radioactivity concentration and potassium concentration in the rock for a
potential site of an underground argon source in South Dakota. Depending on the
probability of $^{39}$Ar and $^{40}$Ar produced underground being dissolved in
the water, the upper limit of the concentration of $^{39}$Ar in the underground
water at this site is estimated to be in a range of a factor of 1.6 to 155 less

between order and disorder, exhibit a dynamics comprising a scale-free mixture
of order and disorder which is universal, i.e. system-independent (1-5). It
allows systems at criticality to adapt swiftly to environmental changes (i.e.,
high susceptibility) as well as to flexibly process and store information.
These unique properties prompted the conjecture that the brain might operate at
criticality (1), a view supported by the recent description of neuronal
avalanches in cortex in vitro (6-8), in anesthetized rats (9) and awake
primates (10), and in neuronal models (11-16). Despite the attractiveness of
this idea, its validity is hampered by the fact that its theoretical
underpinning relies solely on the replication of sizes and durations of
avalanches, which reflect only a portion of the rich dynamics found at
criticality. Here we show experimentally five fundamental properties of
avalanches consistent with criticality: (1) a separation of time scales, in
which the power law probability density of avalanches sizes s, P(s) and the
lifetime distribution of avalanches are invariant to slow, external driving;
(2) stationary P(s) over time; (3) the avalanche probabilities preceding and
following main avalanches obey Omori law (17, 18) for earthquakes; (4) the
average size of avalanches following a main avalanche decays as a power law;
(5) the spatial spread of avalanches has a fractal dimension and obeys
finite-size scaling. Thus, neuronal avalanches are a robust manifestation of
criticality in the brain.

adoption of single-molecule techniques has been impeded by equipment cost and
the laborious nature of making measurements one molecule at a time. We have
solved these issues with a new approach: massively parallel single-molecule
force measurements using centrifugal force. This approach is realized in a
novel instrument that we call the Centrifuge Force Microscope (CFM), in which
objects in an orbiting sample are subjected to a calibration-free,
macroscopically uniform force-field while their micro-to-nanoscopic motions are
observed. We demonstrate high-throughput single-molecule force spectroscopy
with this technique by performing thousands of rupture experiments in parallel,
characterizing force-dependent unbinding kinetics of an antibody-antigen pair
in minutes rather than days. Additionally, we verify the force accuracy of the
instrument by measuring the well-established DNA overstretching transition at
66 $\pm$ 3 pN. With significant benefits in efficiency, cost, simplicity, and
versatility, ""single-molecule centrifugation"" has the potential to
revolutionize single-molecule experimentation, and open access to a wider range
of researchers and experimental systems.

promising because a kinematical signature can be used to separate the signal

The ensemble of emergent networks yields an exponentially decaying in-degree

coefficient, degree-degree correlation, rich club coefficient and k-core

gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) have been rapidly growing, even approaching the very
early Universe (the record holder currently is z=8.3). The observed high-z LGRB
rate shows significant excess over that estimated from the star formation
history. We investigate what may be responsible for this high productivity of
GRBs at high-z through Monte Carlo simulations, with effective Swif/BAT trigger
and redshift detection probabilities based on current Swift/BAT sample and
CGRO/BATSE LGRB sample. We compare our simulations to the Swift observations
via log N-log P, peak luminosity (L) and redshift distributions. In the case
that LGRB rate is purely proportional to the star formation rate (SFR), our
simulations poorly reproduce the LGRB rate at z>4, although the simulated log
N-log P distribution is in good agreement with the observed one. Assuming that
the excess of high-z GRB rate is due to the cosmic metallicity evolution or
unknown LGRB rate increase parameterized as (1+z)^delta, we find that although
the two scenarios alone can improve the consistency between our simulations and
observations, incorporation of them gives much better consistency. We get
0.2<epsilon<0.6 and delta<0.6, where epsilon is the metallicity threshold for
the production of LGRBs. The best consistency is obtained with a parameter set
(epsilon, delta)=(~0.4, ~0.4), and BAT might trigger a few LGRBs at z~14. With
increasing detections of GRBs at z>4 (~15% of GRBs in current Swift LGRB sample

metrics we show that the best constant is achieved by the induced metric on the

orthogonally and hence is a solution of the free boundary problem for the area

$\sigma_1(\sig)L(\p\Sigma)$ is dominated by that of the critical catenoid with
equality if and only if the annulus is conformally equivalent to the critical
catenoid by a conformal transformation which is an isometry on the boundary. We
prove general upper bounds for conformal metrics on manifolds of any dimension
which can be properly conformally immersed into the unit ball in terms of
certain conformal volume quantities. We show that these bounds are only

ground-state energies within less than 1% of the lowest values published. The
non-iterative nature of this formulation and the fact that spatial symmetries

adapted by protein backbones, and yet, folded proteins show an astounding
diversity in functionality. For structure to have any bearing on function, it
is thus imperative that, apart from the protein backbone, other tunable degrees
of freedom be accountable. Here, we focus on side-chain interactions, which
non-covalently link amino acids in folded proteins to form a network structure.
At a coarse-grained level, we show that the network conforms remarkably well to
realizations of random graphs and displays associated percolation behavior.
Thus, within the rigid framework of the protein backbone that restricts the
structure space, the side-chain interactions exhibit an element of randomness,
which account for the functional flexibility and diversity shown by proteins.
However, at a finer level, the network exhibits deviations from these random
graphs which, as we demonstrate for a few specific examples, reflect the
intrinsic uniqueness in the structure and stability, and perhaps specificity in
the functioning of biological proteins.

pairwise interactions between neurons account for observed higher-order

then construct network ensembles that generalize the network instances observed

time, lookup time, and space consumption. In terms of update time and lookup
time there are known constructions that guarantee constant-time operations in
the worst case with high probability, and in terms of space consumption there
are known constructions that use essentially optimal space. However, although
the first analysis of a dynamic dictionary dates back more than 45 years ago
(when Knuth analyzed linear probing in 1963), the trade-off between these
aspects of performance is still not completely understood. In this paper we
settle two fundamental open problems: - We construct the first dynamic
dictionary that enjoys the best of both worlds: it stores n elements using
(1+epsilon)n memory words, and guarantees constant-time operations in the worst
case with high probability. Specifically, for any epsilon = \Omega((\log\log n
/ \log n)^{1/2} ) and for any sequence of polynomially many operations, with
high probability over the randomness of the initialization phase, all
operations are performed in constant time which is independent of epsilon. The
construction is a two-level variant of cuckoo hashing, augmented with a
""backyard"" that handles a large fraction of the elements, together with a
de-amortized perfect hashing scheme for eliminating the dependency on epsilon.
- We present a variant of the above construction that uses only (1+o(1))B bits,
where B is the information-theoretic lower bound for representing a set of size
n taken from a universe of size u, and guarantees constant-time operations in
the worst case with high probability, as before. This problem was open even in
the amortized setting. One of the main ingredients of our construction is a
permutation-based variant of cuckoo hashing, which significantly improves the
space consumption of cuckoo hashing when dealing with a rather small universe.

PN G135.9+55.9 has frequently been debated in the literature. We wanted to
clarify the situation by making an improved abundance determination based on a
study that includes both new accurate observations and new models. We made
observations using the method of integral field spectroscopy with the PMAS
instrument, and also used ultraviolet observations that were measured with
HST-STIS. In our interpretation of the reduced and calibrated spectrum we used
for the first time, recent radiation hydrodynamic models, which were calculated
with several setups of scaled values of mean Galactic disk planetary nebula
metallicities. For evolved planetary nebulae, such as PN G135.9+55.9, it turns
out that departures from thermal equilibrium can be significant, leading to
much lower electron temperatures, hence weaker emission in collisionally
excited lines. Based on our time-dependent hydrodynamic models and the observed
emission line [OIII]5007, we found a very low oxygen content of about 1/80 of
the mean Galactic disk value. This result is consistent with emission line
measurements in the ultraviolet wavelength range. The C/O and Ne/O ratios are
unusually high and similar to those of another halo object, BoBn-1.

are the basis of several universal lossless compression techniques. These
algorithms are asymmetric regarding encoding/decoding time and memory
requirements, with the former being much more demanding. In the past years,
considerable attention has been devoted to the problem of finding efficient
data structures to support these searches, aiming at optimizing the encoders in
terms of speed and memory. Hash tables, binary search trees and suffix trees
have been widely used for this purpose, as they allow fast search at the
expense of memory. Some recent research has focused on suffix arrays (SA), due
to their low memory requirements and linear construction algorithms. Previous
work has shown how the LZ77 decomposition can be computed using a single SA or
an SA with an auxiliary array with the longest common prefix information. The
SA-based algorithms use less memory than the tree-based encoders, allocating
the strictly necessary amount of memory, regardless of the contents of the text
to search/encode. In this paper, we improve on previous work by proposing
faster SA-based algorithms for LZ77 encoding and sub-string search, keeping
their low memory requirements. For some compression settings, on a large set of
benchmark files, our low-memory SA-based encoders are also faster than
tree-based encoders. This provides time and memory efficient LZ77 encoding,
being a possible replacement for trees on well known encoders like LZMA. Our
algorithm is also suited for text classification, because it provides a compact
way to describe text in a bag-of-words representation, as well as a fast
indexing mechanism that allows to quickly find all the sets of words that start
with a given symbol, over a static dictionary.

necessity for application of the quantum field theoretical formalism). Second
one is definition of the classical dimension of a physical system (that can be

Planck charge, but without any explicit expression for system mass or (reduced)

length corresponds to geometrical mean value between (reduced) Compton

Susskind-Horowitz-Polchinski correspondence between Schwarzschild black hole
and strings. Firstly, similarly to naive, classical mechanical Laplace
determination of the Schwarzschild radius, we suggest a simple, classical
mechanical equation. It determines amplitude of such sufficiently strong
classical elastic force that forbids escape of a Planck mass particle moving by
speed of light from end of corresponding classical elastic spring, simply
called dark spring. Also, by use of a formal identity between given elastic
force and Schwarzschild gravitational ""force"", we introduce phenomenologically
a simple quantization rule. It states that circumference (corresponding to
elastic force amplitude equivalent formally to Schwarzschild radius) holds
natural number of corresponding reduced Compton's wave length. (It is deeply
analogous to Bohr's quantization postulate in Bohr's atomic theory interpreted
by de Broglie relation.) Then, very simply (by simple algebraic equations only)
and surprisingly, we obtain such dark spring characteristics corresponding to
basic thermodynamical characteristics (Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and Hawking
temperature) for corresponding Schwarzschild black hole. Finally, simple
comparison between obtained dark spring characteristics and
Susskind-Horowitz-Polchinski correspondence, a simple correspondence between
strings and dark spring, i.e. classical linear harmonic oscillator follows.
Square root of the elasticity coefficient of the dark spring corresponds to
quotient of one string coupling g and Newtonian gravitational constant, or,
classical elasticity coefficient of the dark spring corresponds to reciprocal
(inverse) value of the square root of a string state excitation level N.

weak-strong coupling approach effectively leads to dressed interactions between
polyvalent counterions and thus directly affects the correlation attraction
mediated by polyvalent counterions between like-charged objects. The general
theory is specifically applied to a system composed of two uniformly charged
plane-parallel surfaces in the presence of salt and polyvalent counterions. In
the strong coupling limit for polyvalent counterions the comparison with
Monte-Carlo simulations shows good agreement for large enough values of the

spatial transformation, with which a physical phenomenon described in an
initial space is transformed to a deformed space, and interpret the mapping by
local affine transformation point-by-point. Further, we postulate that the
transformed material property and field must rebuild the same physical process,
and that the energy must be conserved at each point during the transformation.
These conditions impose the constraint on the transformed relation for material
property and field. By establishing two local Cartesian frames defined uniquely
by the spatial transformation, any physical quantity is shown to first
experience a rigid rotation and then a stretch operation during the
transformation. We show that the constraint conditions are not enough to
determine completely the transformed relation for TA, leaving a possibility to
define them differently as found in the literature. New acoustic
transformations with constant density or modulus are also proposed and verified
by constructing a two-dimensional acoustic cloak. Finally, we show that the
transformed relation is uniquely determined for transformation optics, and
discuss how this method can be extended to other transformation physics.

has been proposed as a way to unify inflation with weak-scale physics, with the
inflaton being identified with the Higgs boson or other weak-scale scalar
article. These models require a large non-minimal coupling xi ~ 10^{4} to have
agreement with the observed density perturbations. However, it has been
suggested that such models are unnatural, due to an apparent breakdown of the
calculation of Higgs-Higgs scattering via graviton exchange in the Jordan
frame. Here we argue that Higgs inflation models are in fact natural and that
the breakdown does not imply new physics due to strong-coupling effects or
unitarity breakdown, but simply a failure of perturbation theory in the Jordan
frame as a calculational method. This can be understood by noting that the
model is completely consistent when analysed in the Einstein frame and that
scattering rates in the two frames are equal by the Equivalence Theorem for
non-linear field redefinitions.

geometrically restricted dissipation on the wave component of the system. It is

lattice with box length a, I obtain a systematic strong coupling expansion of
the Hamiltonian in \lambda\equiv g^{-2/3}, with the free part being the sum of
Hamiltonians of Yang-Mills quantum mechanics of constant fields for each box,

As a first step, the interacting glueball vacuum and the energy spectrum of the
interacting spin-0 glueball are obtained to order \lambda^2. Its relation to
the renormalisation of the coupling constant in the IR is discussed, indicating
the absence of infrared fixed points.

  Second-Order Cone Programming",,,,,"stat.ME math.OC math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Elfving's Theorem is a major result in the theory of optimal experimental
design, which gives a geometrical characterization of $c-$optimality. In this
paper, we extend this theorem to the case of multiresponse experiments, and we
show that when the number of experiments is finite, $c-,A-,T-$ and $D-$optimal
design of multiresponse experiments can be computed by Second-Order Cone
Programming (SOCP). Moreover, our SOCP approach can deal with design problems
in which the variable is subject to several linear constraints.
  We give two proofs of this generalization of Elfving's theorem. One is based
on Lagrangian dualization techniques and relies on the fact that the
semidefinite programming (SDP) formulation of the multiresponse $c-$optimal
design always has a solution which is a matrix of rank $1$. Therefore, the
complexity of this problem fades.
  We also investigate a \emph{model robust} generalization of $c-$optimality,
for which an Elfving-type theorem was established by Dette (1993). We show with
the same Lagrangian approach that these model robust designs can be computed
efficiently by minimizing a geometric mean under some norm constraints.
Moreover, we show that the optimality conditions of this geometric programming
problem yield an extension of Dette's theorem to the case of multiresponse
experiments.
  When the number of unknown parameters is small, or when the number of linear
functions of the parameters to be estimated is small, we show by numerical
examples that our approach can be between 10 and 1000 times faster than the
classic, state-of-the-art algorithms.

enhanced, gaugino masses. This allows us to set up general guidelines for model
building and to identify the hypotheses underlying the phenomenological
predictions. In the context of models based on the ""minimal"" gauge group
SO(10), we show that only two ""pure"" embeddings of the MSSM fields are possible

$m^2_{\bar{5}} = 2 m^2_{10}$ or $m^2_{\bar{5}} = (3/4) m^2_{10}$ (in SU(5)

to make this scheme testable at the LHC. We also discuss three possible

We propose the concept of partial quantiles, which are based on a given partial
order. We establish that partial quantiles are equivariant under
order-preserving transformations of the data, robust to outliers, characterize
the probability distribution if the partial order is sufficiently rich,
generalize the concept of efficient frontier, and can measure dispersion from
the partial order perspective. We also study several statistical aspects of
partial quantiles. We provide estimators, associated rates of convergence, and
asymptotic distributions that hold uniformly over a continuum of quantile
indices. Furthermore, we provide procedures that can restore monotonicity
properties that might have been disturbed by estimation error, establish
computational complexity bounds, and point out a concentration of measure
phenomenon (the latter under independence and the componentwise natural order).
Finally, we illustrate the concepts by discussing several theoretical examples
and simulations. Empirical applications to compare intake nutrients within
diets, to evaluate the performance of investment funds, and to study the impact
of policies on tobacco awareness are also presented to illustrate the concepts
and their use.
