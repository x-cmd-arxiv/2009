n-particle N^(k-2)MHV scattering amplitudes in N=4 SYM and the residues of a
contour integral with a natural measure over the Grassmannian G(k,n). In this
note we show that a simple contour deformation converts the sum of Grassmannian
residues associated with the BCFW expansion of NMHV tree amplitudes to the CSW
expansion of the same amplitude. We propose that for general k the same
deformation yields the (k-2) parameter Risager expansion. We establish this
equivalence for all MHV-bar amplitudes and show that the Risager degrees of
freedom are non-trivially determined by the GL(k-2) ""gauge"" degrees of freedom
in the Grassmannian. The Risager expansion is known to recursively construct
the CSW expansion for all tree amplitudes, and given that the CSW expansion
follows directly from the (super) Yang-Mills Lagrangian in light-cone gauge,
this contour deformation allows us to directly see the emergence of local
space-time physics from the Grassmannian.

conservative hypothesis testing to establish for each of these moving groups
whether it could conceivably consist of a coeval population of stars. We
conclude that they do not: the moving groups are not trivially associated with
their eponymous open clusters nor with any other inhomogeneous star formation
event. Concerning a possible dynamical origin of the moving groups, we test
whether any of the moving groups has a higher or lower metallicity than the
background population of thin disk stars, as would generically be the case if
the moving groups are associated with resonances of the bar or spiral
structure. We find clear evidence that the Hyades moving group has higher than
average metallicity and weak evidence that the Sirius moving group has lower
than average metallicity, which could indicate that these two groups are
related to the inner Lindblad resonance of the spiral structure. Further we
find weak evidence that the Hercules moving group has higher than average
metallicity, as would be the case if it is associated with the bar's outer
Lindblad resonance. The Pleiades moving group shows no clear metallicity
anomaly, arguing against a common dynamical origin for the Hyades and Pleiades
groups. Overall, however, the moving groups are barely distinguishable from the
background population of stars, raising the likelihood that the moving groups
are associated with transient perturbations. [abridged]

rest equivalent width W0 of MgII absorbers and the associated OII luminosity,
an estimator of star formation rate.
  This correlation has interesting implications: using only observable
quantities we show that MgII absorbers trace a substantial fraction of the
global OII luminosity density and recover the overall star formation history of
the Universe derived from classical emission estimators up to z~2. We then show
that the distribution function of MgII rest equivalent widths, dN/dW0 inherits
both its shape and amplitude from the OII luminosity function Phi(L). These
distributions can be naturally connected, without any free parameter.
  Our results imply a high covering factor of cold gas around star forming
galaxies: C>0.5, favoring outflows as the mechanism responsible for MgII
absorption. We then argue that intervening MgII absorbers and blue-shifted MgII
absorption seen in the spectra of star forming galaxies are essentially the
same systems. These results not only shed light on the nature of MgII absorbers
but also provide us with a new probe of star formation, in absorption, i.e. in
a way which does not suffer from dust extinction and with a
redshift-independent sensitivity. As shown in this analysis, such a tool can be
applied in a noise-dominated regime, i.e. using a dataset for which emission
lines are not detected in individual objects. This is of particular interest

thermonuclear (type Ia) or (B) core collapse supernovae (SNe). The requisite
dynamical properties that would account for the observed data are quite
distinct, for cases (A) and (B). We determine these requirements in simple
hidden valley models, where the escape fraction problem is naturally addressed,
due to the long lifetime of the new composite states. A novel feature of
scenario (A) is that the dynamics of type Ia SNe, standard candles for
cosmological measurements, might be affected by our mechanism. In case (A), the
mass of the state mediating between the hidden sector and the SM $\ee$ could be
a few hundred GeV and within the reach of a 500 GeV $\ee$ linear collider. We
also note that kinetic mixing of the photon with a light vector state may
provide an interesting alternate mediation mechanism in this case. Scenarios
based on case (B) are challenged by the need for a mechanism to transport some
of the produced positrons toward the Galactic bulge, due to the inferred
distribution of core collapse sources. The mass of the mediator in case (B) is
typically hundreds of TeV, leading to long-lived particles that could, under
certain circumstances, include a viable dark matter candidate. The appearance
of long-lived particles in typical models leads to cosmological constraints and
we address how a consistent cosmic history may be achieved.

a highly periodic swimming behavior as the fluid viscosity is varied from 1.0
mPa-s to 12 mPa-s. Surprisingly, the nematode's swimming speed (~0.35 mm/s) is
nearly insensitive to the range of fluid viscosities investigated here.
However, the nematode's beating frequency decreases to an asymptotic value

the nematode's Young's modulus and tissue viscosity. Both material properties

transferred from the source to the destination in the given journey. Combining
a stochastic model (conveying all possible journeys) and an analysis of the
durations of the nodes' encounters, we study the properties of journeys that
maximize the space-time information propagation capacity, in bit-meters per
second. More specifically, we provide theoretical lower and upper bounds on the
information propagation speed, as a function of the journey capacity. In the
particular case of random way-point-like models (i.e., when nodes move for a
distance of the order of the network domain size before changing direction), we
show that, for relatively large journey capacities, the information propagation
speed is of the same order as the mobile node speed. This implies that,
surprisingly, in sparse but large-scale mobile DTNs, the space-time information
propagation capacity in bit-meters per second remains proportional to the
mobile node speed and to the size of the transported data bundles, when the
bundles are relatively large. We also verify that all our analytical bounds are

salient and pervasive foamlike pattern in which matter has organized itself on
scales of a few up to more than a hundred Megaparsec. First, we describe the
Delaunay Tessellation Field Estimator (DTFE). The DTFE formalism is shown to
recover the hierarchical nature and the anisotropic morphology of the cosmic
matter distribution. The Multiscale Morphology Filter (MMF) uses the DTFE
density field to extract the diverse morphological elements - filaments, sheets
and clusters - on the basis of a ScaleSpace analysis which searches for these
morphologies over a range of scales. Subsequently, we discuss the Watershed
Voidfinder (WVF), which invokes the discrete watershed transform to identify
voids in the cosmic matter distribution. The WVF is able to determine the
location, size and shape of the voids. The watershed transform is also a key
element in the SpineWeb analysis of the cosmic matter distribution. It allows
the determination of the filamentary spine and connected walls in the cosmic
matter density field through the identification of the singularities and
corresponding separatrices. Finally, we describe the concept of Alphashapes for
assessing the topology of the cosmic matter distribution.

abundances for Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, and Ni. Yonsai-Yale and Granada solar-scaled
evolutionary models for the observed metal abundance reproduce the components
fairly well at an age of approx. 2 Gyr. Perfect agreement is, however, obtained
at an age of 2.3 Gyr for a combination of a) a slight downwards adjustment of
the envelope mixing length parameter for the secondary, as seen for other
active solar-type stars, and b) a slightly lower helium content than prescribed
by the Y-Z relations adopted for the standard model grids. The orbit is
eccentric (e = 0.0758 +/- 0.0020), and apsidal motion with a 62% relativistic
contribution has been detected. The apsidal motion period is U = 16300 +/- 3900
yr, and the inferred mean central density concentration coefficient, log(k_2) =

rotational velocities, 9.0 +/- 0.7 (primary) and 8.8 +/- 0.6 (secondary) km/s,

This approach guarantees Poincare invariance. Using a Feshbach reduction the

given similar conditions (i.e. number of nodes, number of links, degree
distribution and clustering), fewer colors are needed to color disassortative
(high degree nodes tend to connect to low degree nodes and vice versa) than
assortative networks. Fewer colors create fewer independent sets which in turn
imply higher concurrency potential for a network. Since PPI networks tend to be
disassortative, we suggest that in addition to functional specificity and
stability proposed previously by Maslov and Sneppen (Science 296, 2002), the
disassortative nature of PPI networks may promote the ability of cells to
perform multiple, crucial and functionally diverse tasks concurrently. Second,
since graph coloring is closely related to the presence of cliques in a graph,
the significance of node coloring information to the problem of identifying
protein complexes, i.e. dense subgraphs in a PPI network, is investigated. We
find that for PPI networks where 1% to 11% of nodes participate in at least one
identified protein complex, such as H. sapien (DIP20070219, DIP20081014 and
HPRD070609), DSATUR (a well-known complete graph coloring algorithm) node
coloring information can improve the quality (homogeneity and separation) of

case. Using Enhanced LIGO and Advanced LIGO noise curves, we find that the
overlap between the EOB and the numerical (2,2) mode, maximized over the
initial phase and time of arrival, is larger than 0.999 for binaries with total
mass 30-200Ms. In addition to the leading (2,2) mode, we compare four
subleading modes. We find good amplitude and frequency agreements between the
EOB and numerical modes for both spin configurations considered, except for the
(3,2) mode in the spin anti-aligned case. We believe that the larger difference
in the (3,2) mode is due to the lack of knowledge of post-Newtonian spin
effects in the higher modes.

behavior of the outer edge of Saturn's massive B ring is determined only in
part by a static response to the 2:1 inner Lindblad resonance with Mimas. In
Cassini images of this region, we find, in addition to the expected
wavenumber-2 forced distortion, evidence for unforced self-excited
wavenumber-3, wavenumber-2, and wavenumber-1 normal modes. These are the first
observations to suggest substantial wave amplification in Saturn's broad rings.
Moreover, the presence of these free modes strongly implicates viscous
overstability as their underlying cause and, by inference, the cause for most
if not all of the unforced structures throughout the high-mass-density B ring
and in other high-mass-density regions in Saturn's rings. Analysis of each of
the inferred waves reveals a consistent lower bound on the average surface mass
density of ~ 44 g/cm^2 for the outer 250 km of the ring, though the true
surface density could be as high as 100 g/cm^2 or higher. Interference between
the forced and free wavenumber-2 modes yields a total wavenumber-2 pattern that
varies in amplitude and orientation with a characteristic period of ~ 5.5
years. We also find localized disturbances, including 3.5-km-tall vertical
structures, that provide circumstantial evidence for embedded massive bodies in
the Mimas resonance zone. The presence of such bodies is supported by the
presence of a shadow-casting moonlet ~ 0.3 km wide near the ring's edge.

Lagrangian time-correlations of the absolute values of velocity and pressure

collapse of the correlation functions. The data used in this study are sampled

Taylor-scale Reynolds number 433, and supports spatial differentiation and
spatial/temporal interpolation inside the database. The analysis shows that the
temporal evolution of the auto-correlations of the absolute values are
determined not by the local Kolmogorov time-scale but by the local
eddy-turnover time scale. However, considerable scatter remains and appears to
be reduced only after a further (intermittency) correction factor of the form
of $(r/L)^\chi$ is introduced where $L$ is the turbulence integral scale. The
exponent $\chi$ varies for different variables. The collapse of the correlation
functions for absolute values is, however, less satisfactory than the collapse
observed for the more rapidly decaying strain-rate tensor element correlation

galaxies were studied. Each source was rotated so that the symmetry axis of the
source was horizontal, and vertical cross-sectional cuts were taken across the
source at intervals of one beam size. These were used to study the
cross-sectional surface brightness profiles, the width of each slice, radio
emissivity as a function of position across each slice, the first and second
moments, and the average surface brightness, minimum energy magnetic field
strength, and pressure of each slice. A Gaussian provides a good description of
the surface brightness profile of cross-sectional slices. The Gaussian FWHM as
a function of distance from the hot spot first increases and then decreases
with distance from the hot spot. The width as a function of distance from the
hot spot is highly symmetric on each side of the source. The radio emissivity
is often close to flat across a slice, indicating a roughly constant emissivity
and pressure for that slice. Some slices show variations in radio emissivity
that indicate an ``edge-peaked'' pressure profile for that slice; these often
occur in slices near the local maxima of the bridge width. The emissivity does
not exhibit any signature of emission from a jet. The first moment is generally
quite close to zero indicating only small excursions of the ridge line from the
symmetry axis of the source. The second moment indicates the same source shape
as is found using the Gaussian FWHM. The average magnetic field strength and
pressure decrease with increasing distance from the hot spot, reaching a
roughly constant value at a location that is typically just before the location
of a local maximum of the bridge width. These results are interpreted in terms
of a heuristic model for the radio lobes.

lengths which are distributed over the unit (n-1) simplex according to a

determined by the external magnetic field in the Wess-Zumino term, whose

black-hole binaries. As in previous descriptions, we endow the effective
particle not only with a mass m, but also with a spin S*. Thus, the effective
particle interacts with the effective Kerr background (having spin S_Kerr)
through a geodesic-type interaction and an additional spin-dependent
interaction proportional to S*. When expanded in post-Newtonian (PN) orders,
the EOB Hamiltonian reproduces the leading order spin-spin coupling and the
spin-orbit coupling through 2.5PN order, for any mass-ratio. Also, it
reproduces all spin-orbit couplings in the test-particle limit. Similarly to
the test-particle limit case, when we restrict the EOB dynamics to spins
aligned or antialigned with the orbital angular momentum, for which circular
orbits exist, the EOB dynamics has several interesting features, such as the
existence of an innermost stable circular orbit, a photon circular orbit, and a
maximum in the orbital frequency during the plunge subsequent to the inspiral.
These properties are crucial for reproducing the dynamics and
gravitational-wave emission of spinning black-hole binaries, as calculated in
numerical relativity simulations.

high-resolution rotation curves of nine LSB galaxies. We fit these dark matter

While the minimum core size in WDM models is predicted to decrease with halo
mass, we find that the inferred core radii increase with halo mass and also
cannot be explained with a single value of the primordial phase space density.
Moreover, if the core size is set by WDM particle properties, then even the
smallest cores we infer would require primordial phase space density values
that are orders of magnitude smaller than lower limits obtained from the Lyman
alpha forest power spectra. We also find that the dark matter halo core
densities vary by a factor of about 30 from system to system while showing no
systematic trend with the maximum rotation velocity of the galaxy. This
strongly argues against the core size being directly set by large
self-interactions (scattering or annihilation) of dark matter. We therefore
conclude that the inferred cores do not provide motivation to prefer WDM or
SIDM over other dark matter models.

string theory, where the monodromy from wrapped branes extends the range of the
closed string axions to beyond the Planck scale. The superimposed oscillations
in the potential can lead to new signatures in the CMB spectrum and bispectrum.
In particular the bispectrum will have a new distinct shape. We calculate the
power spectrum and bispectrum of curvature perturbations in the model, as well
as make analytic estimates in various limiting cases. From the numerical
analysis we find that for a wide range of allowed parameters the model produces
a feature in the bispectrum with fnl ~ 50 or larger while the power spectrum is
almost featureless. This model is therefore an example of a string-inspired
inflationary model which is testable mainly through its non-Gaussian features.
Finally we provide a simple analytic fitting formula for the bispectrum which
is accurate to approximately 5% in all cases, and easily implementable in codes
designed to provide non-Gaussian templates for CMB analyses.

radiation fields that can influence the post-merger dynamics. Older studies
concentrated on either one or the other of these challenges, but now efforts
are being made to model both relativity and microphysics accurately together.

wave signals of such events and to address their potential for generating

systems is a challenging problem in condensed matter physics. In dimensions
greater than one, interacting electrons can often be understood within
Fermi-liquid theory where low-energy excitations are weakly interacting
quasiparticles. On the contrary, electrons in one dimension are known to form a
strongly-correlated phase of matter called a Luttinger liquid (LL), whose
low-energy excitations are collective density waves, or plasmons, of the
electron gas. Here we show that spectroscopy of locally injected high-energy
electrons can be used to probe energy relaxation in the presence of such strong
correlations. For detection energies near the injection energy, the electron
distribution is described by a power law whose exponent depends in a continuous
way on the Luttinger parameter, and energy relaxation can be attributed to
plasmon emission. For a chiral LL as realized at the edge of a fractional
quantum Hall state, the distribution function grows linearly with the distance
to the injection energy, independent of filling fraction.

concentrate here on the influence of molecular vibrations. Two types of
vibrations are investigated: (i) the breathing internal molecular modes, where
the coupling occurs between the molecular deformation and the charge density,
and (ii) the oscillations of molecule between the contacts, where the
displacement affects the tunneling. The system is described by models which are
solved numerically using Schoenhammer-Gunnarsson's projection operators and
Wilson's numerical renormalization group methods. Case (i) is considered within
the Anderson-Holstein model. Here the influence of the phonons is mainly to
suppress the repulsion between the electrons at the molecular orbital. Case
(ii) is described by a two-channel Anderson model with phonon-assisted
hybridization. In both cases, the coupling to electrons softens the vibrational
mode and in the strong coupling regime makes the displacement unstable to
perturbations that break the symmetry of the confining potential. For instance,
in case (ii) when the frequency of oscillations decreases below the magnitude
of perturbation breaking the left-right symmetry, the molecule will be abruptly
attracted to one of the electrodes. In this regime, the Kondo temperature
increases but the conductance through the molecule is suppressed.

that all of the five metal-poor globular clusters exhibit strong evidence of

from their proper motions, and effects of dynamical interactions with the
Galaxy. Our findings include detections of a tidal bridge-like feature and an

surface density profiles for different angular sections and azimuthal number

large change in spectral index across the sample. Thus, the contribution to the
IR spectrum from the AGN and starburst components can be comparable in
magnitude but the relative contribution also varies widely across the sample.
We find rank correlations between several AGN tracers. We search for
correlations between AGN and Starburst tracers and we conclude that the AGN and
Starburst tracers are not correlated. This is consistent with our conclusion
that the relative strength of the AGN and Starburst components varies widely

Hole Growth and star formation in these galaxies. The distribution of Sil 10
micron and 18 micron strengths is consistent with the clumpy torus models of

the 6.7 micron continuum which may be due to an extended component of hot dust.

doping-induced transition between the two states is first order, or the two
pure phases are separated by an intermediate phase with coexisting SC and SDW
orders. For perfect nesting, the two orders do not coexist, because SDW order,
which comes first, gaps the full Fermi surface leaving no space for SC to
develop. When nesting is not perfect due to either ellipticity of electron
bands or doping-induced difference in chemical potentials for holes and
electrons, SDW order still leaves modified Fermi surfaces for not too strong
SDW magnetism and the SC order may develop. We show that the two orders coexist
only when certain relations between ellipticity and doping are met. In
particular, in a compensated metal, ellipticity alone is not sufficient for
coexistence of the two orders.

couple to the electronic transition, the configurational displacement of the

excited-state absorption spectrum using two totally symmetric vibrational modes
with frequencies 450 (dimer) or 400 cm$^{-1}$ (trimer), and 1666 cm$^{-1}$. The
reorganization energy of the ground-state absorption is rather insensitive to

the Sagittarius-Carina or Perseus spiral arm. Our analysis indicates a higher
B/O ratio in the inner Sagittarius-Carina spiral arm than in the vicinity of
the Sun, which may suggest that B production in the current epoch is dominated
by a secondary process. The average gas-phase B abundance in the warm diffuse
ISM is consistent with the abundances determined for a variety of Galactic disk
stars, but is depleted by 60 percent relative to the solar system value. Our
survey also reveals sight lines with enhanced B abundances that potentially
trace recent production of B-11 either by cosmic-ray or neutrino-induced
spallation. Such sight lines will be key to discerning the relative importance
of the two production routes for B-11 synthesis.

place where magnetic field energy converts into the plasma heat and/or flow

the Y-point of the pulsar magnetosphere in axisymmetric geometry. The
electromagnetic solver is used in the two-dimensional grid points with the
cylindrical coordinate (R, z), while the particle solver operates in the
three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate (x, y, z), where the Buneman-Boris
method is used. The particle motion is treated in special relativity. The inner
boundary conditions are set up to generate rotation of the magnetosphere by use
of the force-free semi-analytic solution given by Uzdensky (2003, ApJ, 598,

  The code has been verified by dispersion relations of all the wave modes in
electron-positron plasmas.
  The initial test run is also presented to demonstrate the Y-shaped structure
at the top of the dead zone on the light cylinder. We suggest that the
structure is variable with quasi-periodicity associated with magnetic
reconnection and that plasma will be accelerated and/or heated. In a

formation associated with the Affleck-Dine (AD) mechanism, taking into account
both of the dilution effect due to Q-ball domination and of finite temperature
effects. The AD mechanism predicts the formation of non-topological solitons,
Q-balls, from which GWs are generated. Q-balls with large conserved charge $Q$
can produce a large amount of GWs. On the other hand, the decay rate of such
Q-balls is so small that they may dominate the energy density of the universe,
which implies that GWs are significantly diluted and that their frequencies are
redshifted during Q-ball dominated era. Thus, the detectability of the GWs
associated with the formation of Q-balls is determined by these two competing
effects. We find that there is a finite but small parameter region where such
GWs may be detected by future detectors such as DECIGO or BBO, only in the case
when the thermal logarithmic potential dominates the potential of the AD field.
Otherwise GWs from Q-balls would not be detectable even by these futuristic
detectors: $\Omega_{\rm GW}^0<10^{-21}$. Unfortunately, for such parameter
region the present baryon asymmetry of the universe can hardly be explained
unless one fine-tunes A-terms in the potential. However the detection of such a
GW background may give us an information about the early universe, for example,
it may suggest that the flat directions with $B-L=0$ are favored.

so-called ``adhesion model'' in cosmology, in a regime where (almost) all the
fluid particles are embedded within point-like massive halos. Following
previous works, we focus our investigations on a ``geometrical'' model, where
the matter evolution within the shock manifold is defined from a geometrical
construction. This hypothesis is at variance with the assumption that the usual
continuity equation holds but, in the inviscid limit, both models agree in the
regular regions. Taking advantage of the formulation of the dynamics of this
``geometrical model'' in terms of Legendre transforms and convex hulls, we
study the evolution with time of the distribution of matter and the associated
partitions of the Lagrangian and Eulerian spaces. We describe how the halo mass
distribution derives from a triangulation in Lagrangian space, while the dual
Voronoi-like tessellation in Eulerian space gives the boundaries of empty
regions with shock nodes at their vertices. We then emphasize that this
dynamics actually leads to halo fragmentations for space dimensions greater or
equal to 2 (for the inviscid limit studied in this article). This is most
easily seen from the properties of the Lagrangian-space triangulation and we
illustrate this process in the two-dimensional (2D) case. In particular, we
explain how point-like halos only merge through three-body collisions while
two-body collisions always give rise to two new massive shock nodes (in 2D).
This generalizes to higher dimensions and we briefly illustrate the
three-dimensional (3D) case. This leads to a specific picture for the
continuous formation of massive halos through successive halo fragmentations
and mergings.

driven by magnetization dynamics. In the limit of smooth magnetization texture,
the dominant spin current induced by the spin pumping effect is shown to be the
diffusive spin current, i.e., the one arising from only a diffusion associated
with spin accumulation. That is to say, there is no effective field that
locally drives the spin current. We also investigate the conversion mechanism
of the pumped spin current into a charge current by spin-orbit interactions,
specifically the inverse spin Hall effect. We show that the spin-charge
conversion does not always occur and that it depends strongly on the type of
spin-orbit interaction. In a Rashba spin-orbit system, the local part of the
charge current is proportional to the spin relaxation torque, and the local
spin current, which does not arise from the spin accumulation, does not play
any role in the conversion. In contrast, the diffusive spin current contributes
to the diffusive charge current. Alternatively, for spin-orbit interactions
arising from random impurities, the local charge current is proportional to the
local spin current that constitutes only a small fraction of the total spin
current. Clearly, the dominant spin current (diffusive spin current) is not
converted into a charge current. Therefore, the nature of the spin current is
fundamentally different depending on its origin and thus the spin transport and
the spin-charge conversion behavior need to be discussed together along with
spin current generation.

possible to measure the GCR electrons + positrons down to roughly 5 GeV.
However, this lower limit in energy is highly dependent on the orbital position

can violate the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality via operationally
local transformations. Operationally local transformations are parameterized
only by local variables, however in order to allow violation of the CHSH
inequality a maximally entangled ancilla was necessary. The use of the
entangled ancilla in this scheme caused the state under test to become
dependent on the measurement choice one uses to calculate the CHSH inequality
thus violating one of the assumptions used in deriving a Bell inequality,
namely the `free will' or `statistical independence' assumption. The novelty in
this scheme however is that the measurement settings can be external free
parameters. In this paper we generalize these operationally local
transformations for multipartite Bell inequalities (with dichotomic
observables) and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for violation
within this scheme. Namely, a violation of a multipartite Bell inequality in
this setting is contingent on whether an ancillary system admits any realistic,
local hidden variable model i.e. whether the ancilla violates the given Bell
inequality. These results indicate that violation of a Bell inequality
performed on a system does not necessarily imply that the system is nonlocal.
In fact the system under test may be completely classical. However, nonlocality
must have resided somewhere, this may have been in the environment, the
physical variables used to manipulate the system or the detectors themselves
provided the measurement settings are external free variables.

Previous studies have addressed the effects of very massive primordial stars on
the collapse of nearby halos into new stars, but the absence of the odd-even
nucleosynthetic signature of pair-instability supernovae in ancient metal-poor
stars suggests that Population III stars may have been less than 100
M$_{\odot}$. We extend our earlier survey of local UV feedback on star
formation to 25 - 80 M$_{\odot}$ stars and include kinetic feedback by
supernovae for 25 - 40 M$_{\odot}$ stars. We find radiative feedback to be
relatively uniform over this mass range, primarily because the larger fluxes of
more massive stars are offset by their shorter lifetimes. Our models
demonstrate that prior to the rise of global UV backgrounds, Lyman-Werner
photons from nearby stars cannot prevent halos from forming new stars. These
calculations also reveal that violent dynamical instabilities can erupt in the
UV radiation front enveloping a primordial halo but that they ultimately have
no effect on the formation of a star. Finally, our simulations suggest that
relic H II regions surrounding partially evaporated halos may expel
Lyman-Werner backgrounds at lower redshifts, allowing stars to form that were
previously suppressed. We provide fits to radiative and kinetic feedback on
star formation for use in both semianalytic models and numerical simulations.

explored in 2011 by NASA's Dawn mission. It is a dry, likely differentiated
body with spectrum suggesting that is has been resurfaced by basaltic lava
flows, not too different from the lunar maria.
  Here we present the first disk-resolved spectroscopic observations of an
asteroid from the ground. We observed (4) Vesta with the ESO-VLT adaptive
optics equipped integral-field near-infrared spectrograph SINFONI, as part of
its science verification campaign. The highest spatial resolution of ~90 km on
Vesta's surface was obtained during excellent seeing conditions (0.5"") in
October 2004.
  We observe spectral variations across Vesta's surface that can be interpreted
as variations of either the pyroxene composition, or the effect of surface
aging. We compare Vesta's 2 micron absorption band to that of
howardite-eucrite-diogenite (HED) meteorites that are thought to originate from
Vesta, and establish particular links between specific regions and HED
subclasses. The overallcomposition is found to be mostly compatible with
howardite meteorites, although a small area around 180 deg. East longitude
could be attributed to a diogenite-rich spot. We finally focus our spectral
analysis on the characteristics of Vesta's bright and dark regions as seen from
Hubble Space Telescope's visible and Keck-II's near-infrared images.

relatively small blue excess measured in our full sample due to that the
observed EGOs are mostly dominated by outflows and at an earlier evolutionary
phase associated with IRDCs and 6.7 GHz methanol masers. The physical
properties of clouds surrounding EGOs derived from CO lines are similar to
those of massive clumps wherein the massive star forming cores associated with

Andrei Suslin that finitely generated projective modules over a polynomial ring
over a field are free. The conjecture of Jonathan Rosenberg which predicts the
homotopy invariance of the negative algebraic K-theory of C(X) follows from the
particular case when M=Z^n. We also give algebraic conditions for a functor
from commutative algebras to abelian groups to be homotopy invariant on

C*-algebras. These criteria have numerous applications. For example, the
vanishing criterion applied to nil-K-theory implies that commutative
C*-algebras are K-regular. As another application, we show that the familiar
formulas of Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg and Loday-Quillen for the algebraic
Hochschild and cyclic homology of the coordinate ring of a smooth algebraic

choice of index differences and bend radius of curvature of the fibers leads to
obtain similaritons. Even for sufficiently small index differences and bend
radii, parabolic pulses are formed at the cost of higher optimum length in

Many of those ideas demand for experimental environments with non-cubic lattice
geometries. In this paper we report on the implementation of a versatile
three-beam lattice allowing for the generation of triangular as well as
hexagonal optical lattices. As an important step the superfluid-Mott insulator
(SF-MI) quantum phase transition has been observed and investigated in detail
in this lattice geometry for the first time. In addition to this we study the
physics of spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) in the presence of the
triangular optical lattice potential, especially spin changing dynamics across
the SF-MI transition. Our results suggest that below the SF-MI phase
transition, a well-established mean-field model describes the observed data
when renormalizing the spin-dependent interaction. Interestingly this opens new
perspectives for a lattice driven tuning of a spin dynamics resonance occurring
through the interplay of quadratic Zeeman effect and spin-dependent
interaction. We finally discuss further lattice configurations which can be
realized with our setup.

theoretically interpreted as kink magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modes. Numerical
simulations by Terradas et al. (2008, ApJ 687, L115) suggest that shear flows
generated at the loop boundary during kink oscillations could give rise to a
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI). Here, we investigate the linear stage of
the KHI in a cylindrical magnetic flux tube in the presence of azimuthal shear
motions. We consider the basic, linearized MHD equations in the beta = 0
approximation, and apply them to a straight and homogeneous cylindrical flux
tube model embedded in a coronal environment. Azimuthal shear flows with a
sharp jump of the velocity at the cylinder boundary are included in the model.
We obtain an analytical expression for the dispersion relation of the unstable
MHD modes supported by the configuration, and compute analytical approximations
of the critical velocity shear and the KHI growth rate in the thin tube limit.
A parametric study of the KHI growth rates is performed by numerically solving
the full dispersion relation. We find that fluting-like modes can develop a KHI
in time-scales comparable to the period of kink oscillations of the flux tube.
The KHI growth rates increase with the value of the azimuthal wavenumber and
decrease with the longitudinal wavenumber. However, the presence of a small
azimuthal component of the magnetic field can suppress the KHI. Azimuthal
motions related to kink oscillations of untwisted coronal loops may trigger a
KHI, but this phenomenon has not been observed to date. We propose that the
azimuthal component of the magnetic field is responsible for suppressing the
KHI in a stable coronal loop. The required twist is small enough to prevent the
development of the pinch instability.

model the flow of information, we introduce in this paper a class of processes

bridge and gamma bridge information processes considered by BHM. An LRB is
defined over a finite time horizon. Conditioned on its terminal value, an LRB
is identical in law to a Levy bridge. We consider in detail the case where the
asset generates a single cash flow $X_T$ occurring at a fixed date $T$. The
flow of market information about $X_T$ is modelled by an LRB terminating at the

paper, the magnetic properties of LaVO$_3$/SrVO$_3$ superlattices, in which the
geometrically confined doping is produced by a one monolayer thick SrVO$_3$

Furthermore, the total magnetization of the superlattice depends on the

parameters of a primitive model (PM) of ionic fluids are studied within the
framework of the statistical field theory based on the collective variables
method. Recently, this approach has enabled us to obtain the correct trends of
the both critical parameters of the equisize charge-asymmetric PM without
assuming ionic association. In this paper we focus on the general case of an
asymmetric PM characterized by the two parameters: hard-sphere diameter-,
$\lambda=\sigma_{+}/\sigma_{-}$ and charge, $z=q_{+}/|q_{-}|$, ratios of the
two ionic species. We derive an explicit expression for the chemical potential
conjugate to the order parameter which includes the effects of correlations up
to the third order. Based on this expression we consider the three versions of
PM: a monovalent size-asymmetric PM ($\lambda\neq 1$, $z=1$), an equisize
charge-asymmetric PM ($\lambda=1$, $z\neq 1$) and a size- and charge-asymmetric
PM ($\lambda\neq 1$, $z=2$). Similar to simulations, our theory predicts that
the critical temperature and the critical density decrease with the increase of
size asymmetry. Regarding the effects of charge asymmetry, we obtain the
correct trend of the critical temperature with $z$, while the trend of the
critical density obtained in this approximation is inconsistent with
simulations, as well as with our previous results found in the higher-order
approximation. We expect that the consideration of the higher-order
correlations will lead to the correct trend of the critical density with charge
asymmetry.

uses scintillating CaWO4 crystals as such a target. The energy deposited by an
interacting particle is primarily converted to phonons which are detected by
transition edge sensors. In addition, a small fraction of the interaction
energy is emitted from the crystals in the form of scintillation light which is
measured in coincidence with the phonon signal by a separate cryogenic light
detector for each target crystal. The ratio of light to phonon energy permits
the discrimination between the nuclear recoils expected from WIMPs and events
from radioactive backgrounds which primarily lead to electron recoils. CRESST
has shown the success of this method in a commissioning run in 2007 and, since
then, further investigated possibilities for an even better suppression of
backgrounds. Here, we report on a new class of background events observed in

oscillate as a function of number of photons N with a period of the order of

shows a double peaked structure at low energies, the secondary pulse decreases
rapidly with increasing energy and above 20keV only the primary pulse is
visible. This evolution is consistent between PCA, HEXTE and ISGRI. We find
that the phase averaged spectrum can be well fitted with a photoabsorbed power
law with a cutoff at high energies and a blackbody component. To investigate
the peculiar pulse profile, we performed phase resolved spectral analysis. We
find that a change in the cutoff energy is required to fit the changing

domain, correlation functions decay on timescales on the order of the mean
Kolmogorov turnover time scale, computed from the globally averaged rate of
dissipation and viscosity. However, when performing the analysis in different
subregions of the flow, turbulence intermittency leads to large spatial
variability in the decay time scales. Remarkably, excellent collapse of the
auto-correlation functions is recovered when using the `local Kolmogorov
time-scale' defined using the locally averaged, rather than the global,

connecting equilibria with octahedral as well as axial symmetry can exist near

concerning CP asymmetries and rare B decays, are discussed in detail. The ""road
map"" towards the precision measurements is presented, including the use of
control channels and other techniques to understand the performance of the
detector with the first data from the LHC.
