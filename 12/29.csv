superconformal QCD, the N=2 super Yang Mills theory with gauge group SU(N_c)
and N_f = 2 N_c fundamental hyper multiplets. The theory admits a Veneziano
expansion of large N_c and large N_f, with N_f/N_c and lambda = g^2 N_c kept
fixed. The topological structure of large N diagrams motivates a general
conjecture: the flavor-singlet sector of a gauge theory in the Veneziano limit
is dual to a closed string theory; single closed string states correspond to
""generalized single-trace"" operators, where adjoint letters and
flavor-contracted fundamental/antifundamental pairs are stringed together in a
closed chain. We look for the string dual of N = 2 superconformal QCD from two
fronts. From the bottom-up, we perform a systematic analysis of the protected
spectrum using superconformal representation theory. We also evaluate the
one-loop dilation operator in the scalar sector, finding a novel spin chain.
  From the top-down, we consider the decoupling limit of known brane
constructions. In both approaches, more insight is gained by viewing the theory
as the degenerate limit of the N = 2 Z_2 orbifold of N = 4 SYM, as one of the
two gauge couplings is tuned to zero. A consistent picture emerges. We conclude
that the string dual is a sub-critical background with seven ""geometric""
dimensions, containing both an AdS_5 and an S^1 factor. The supergravity
approximation is never entirely valid, even for large lambda, indeed the field
theory has an exponential degeneracy of exactly protected states with higher
spin, which must be dual to a sector of light string states.

  (2014) 3591-3599",,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The simplest nonlinear Schrodinger equation that contains the time derivative
of the probability density is investigated. This equation has the same
stationary solutions as its linear counterpart, and these solutions are the
eigenstates of the corresponding linear Hamiltonian. The equation leads to the
usual continuity equation and thus maintains the unitarity of the wave
function. For the non-stationary solutions, numerical calculations are carried
out for the one-dimensional infinite square-well potential and for several
time-dependent potentials that tend to the former as time increases. Results
show that for various initial states, the wave function always evolves into
some eigenstate of the corresponding linear Hamiltonian of the one-dimensional
infinite square-well potential. For a small time-dependent perturbation
potential, solutions present the process similar to the spontaneous transition
between stationary states. For a periodical potential with an appropriate
frequency, solutions present the process similar to the stimulated transition.
This nonlinear Schrodinger equation thus presents the state evolution similar
to the wave-function reduction.

itself electromagnetically, and every b-charge possesses its own elementary EM
field. The EM energy is naturally partitioned as the interaction energy between
pairs of different b-charges. We construct EM theory of b-charges (BEM) based
on a relativistic Lagrangian with the following properties: (i) b-charges
interact only through their elementary EM potentials and fields; (ii) the field
equations for the elementary EM fields are exactly the Maxwell equations with
proper currents; (iii) a free charge moves uniformly preserving up to the
Lorentz contraction its shape; (iv) the Newton equations with the Lorentz
forces hold approximately when charges are well separated and move with
non-relativistic velocities. The BEM theory can be characterized as
neoclassical one which covers the macroscopic as well as the atomic spatial
scales, it describes EM phenomena at atomic scale differently than the
classical EM theory. It yields in macroscopic regimes the Newton equations with
Lorentz forces for centers of well separated charges moving with

the only case where such problem can be treated rigorously analytically, namely
when the cells have spatially confined trajectories, such as the spermatozoa of
some marine invertebrates. We consider two spherical cells swimming, when
isolated, with arbitrary circular trajectories, and derive the long-time
kinematics of their relative locomotion. We show that in the dilute limit where
the cells are much further away than their size, and the size of their circular
motion, a separation of time scale occurs between a fast (intrinsic) swimming
time, and a slow time where hydrodynamic interactions lead to change in the
relative position and orientation of the swimmers. We perform a multiple-scale
analysis and derive the effective dynamical system - of dimension two -
describing the long-time behavior of the pair of cells. We show that the system
displays one type of equilibrium, and two types of rotational equilibrium, all
of which are found to be unstable. A detailed mathematical analysis of the
dynamical systems further allows us to show that only two cell-cell behaviors
are possible in the limit of $t\to\infty$, either the cells are attracted to
each other (possibly monotonically), or they are repelled (possibly
monotonically as well), which we confirm with numerical computations.

6, associated with the six compact dimensions of a bosonic lattice/orbifold
model, we show an additional method for enhancing the standard NAHE gauge group
of SO(10) back to E6. This rotation transforms (SO(10) {\otimes} SO(6)^3)_obs
{\otimes} (E_8)_hid into (E_6 {\otimes} U(1)^5)_obs {\otimes} SO(22)_hid. When
SO(10) is enhanced to E_6 in this manner, the i^{th} MSSM matter generation in
the SO(10) 16_i rep, originating in the twisted basis vector b_i, recombines
with both its associated untwisted MSSM Higgs in a 10_i rep and an untwisted
non-Abelian singlet {\phi}_i, to form a 27_i rep of E_6. Beginning instead with
the E6 model, the inverse transformation of the fermion boundary conditions
corresponds to partial GUT breaking via boundary rotation. Correspondence
between free fermionic models with Z_2 {\otimes} Z_2 twist (especially of the
NAHE class) and orbifold models with a similar twist has received further
attention recently. Our NAHE variation also involves a Z_2 {\otimes} Z_2 twist
and offers additional understanding regarding the free fermion/orbifold
correspondence. Further, models based on this NAHE variation offer some
different phenomenological features compared to NAHE-based models. In
particular, the more compact Z2 {\otimes} Z2 twist of the NAHE variation offers
a range of mirror models not possible from NAHE-based models. Examples of such
models are presented.

multiobject spectrograph at the 8.2-meter VLT/UT1. The strong near-infrared Ca
II triplet (CaT) lines of RGB stars obtained from the high S/N spectra are used
to determine the metallicity and radial velocity of cluster members. We report
for the first time spectroscopically determined metallicity values for four
clusters based on the mean [Fe/H] value of ~10 cluster members each. We found
two concentrations in the distribution of ages of the target clusters. Six have
ages between 0.8-2.2 Gyr and the other two, NGC 1754 and NGC 1786, are very
old. The metallicity of the six intermediate age clusters, with a mean age of
1.5 Gyr, is -0.49 with a scatter of only 0.04. This tight distribution suggests
that a close encounter between the LMC and SMC may have caused not only the
restart of cluster formation in the LMC but the generation of the central bar.
The metallicity for the two old clusters is similar to that of the other old,
metal-poor LMC clusters. We find that the LMC cluster system exhibits disk-like
rotation with no clusters appearing to have halo kinematics and there is no
evidence of a metallicity gradient in the LMC, in contrast with the stellar
population of the MW and M33, where the metallicity decreases as galactocentric
distance increases. The LMC's stellar bar may be the factor responsible for the
dilution of any kind of gradient in the LMC.

ordering vector optimization on the ordered reference state of MSW theory,
which leads to significant improvement of the theory and accounts for quantum
corrections to the classically ordered state. The MSW results at zero
temperature compare favorably to exact diagonalization (ED) and projected
entangled-pair state (PEPS) calculations. The resulting zero-temperature phase
diagram includes a 1D quasi-ordered phase, a 2D Neel ordered phase, and a 2D
spiraling ordered phase. We have strong indications that the various ordered or
quasi-ordered phases are separated by spin-liquid phases with short-range
correlations, in analogy to what has been predicted for the Heisenberg model on
the same lattice. Within MSW theory we also explore the finite-temperature
phase diagram. We find that the zero-temperature long-range-ordered phases turn
into quasi-ordered phases (up to a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless
temperature), while zero-temperature quasi-ordered phases become short-range
correlated at finite temperature. These results show that modified spin-wave
theory is very well suited for describing ordered and quasi-ordered phases of
frustrated XY spins (or, equivalently, of frustrated lattice bosons) both at
zero and finite temperatures. While MSW theory, just as other theoretical
methods, cannot describe spin-liquid phases, its breakdown provides a fast
method for singling out Hamiltonians which may feature these intriguing quantum
phases. We thus suggest a tool for guiding our search for interesting systems

localization of the zero-mode fermions in the extra dimension. In this setup
the Higgs sector is localized near the infrared brane, whereas the Majorana

are almost entirely Majorana particles, whereas the fourth generation neutrino
is mostly a Dirac fermion. We show that it is possible to obtain heavy

Blaine Lawson Jr","Hyperbolic polynomials and the Dirichlet problem","Minor modifications in the exposition have been made.",,,,"math.AP math.CO math.DG math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a simple, self-contained account of Garding's theory of
hyperbolic polynomials, including a recent convexity result of
Bauschke-Guler-Lewis-Sendov and an inequality of Gurvits. This account also
contains new results, such as the existence of a real analytic arrangement of
the eigenvalue functions.
  In a second, independent part of the paper, the relationship of Garding's
theory to the authors' recent work (arXiv:0710.3991) on the Dirichlet problem
for fully nonlinear partial differential equations is investigated. Let p be a
homogeneous polynomial of degree m on S^2(R^n) which is hyperbolic with respect
to the all positive directions A \geq 0. Then p has an associated eigenvalue
map lambda:S^2(R^n) \to R^m, defined modulo the permutation group acting on
R^m. Consequently, each closed symmetric set E of R^m induces a second-order
p.d.e. by requiring, for a C^2-function u in n-variables, that (D^2 u)(x) lie
in the boundary of E for all x. Assume that E + (R_+)^m is contained in E. A
main result is that for smooth domains in R^n whose boundary is suitably
(p,E)-pseudo-convex, the Dirichlet problem has a unique continuous solution for
all continuous boundary data. This applies to a vast collection of examples the
most basic of which are the m distinct branches of the equation p(D^2 u) =0.
  In the authors' recent extension of results from euclidean domains to domains
in riemannian manifolds (arXiv:0907.1981), a new global ingredient, called a
monotonicity subequation, was introduced. It is shown in this paper that for
every polynomial $p$ as above, the associated Garding cone is a monotonicity
cone for all branches of the the equation p(Hess u) = 0 where Hess u denotes
the riemannian Hessian of u.

problem,"" whereby protostars are underluminous compared to the accretion
luminosity expected both from theoretical collapse calculations and arguments
based on the minimum accretion rate necessary to form a star within the
embedded phase duration. Motivated by this luminosity problem, we present a set
of evolutionary models describing the collapse of low-mass, dense cores into
protostars, using the Young & Evans (2005) model as our starting point. We
calculate the radiative transfer of the collapsing cores throughout the full
duration of the collapse in two dimensions. From the resulting spectral energy
distributions, we calculate standard observational signatures to directly
compare to observations. We incorporate several modifications and additions to
the original Young & Evans model in an effort to better match observations with
model predictions. We find that scattering, 2-D geometry, mass-loss, and
outflow cavities all affect the model predictions, as expected, but none
resolve the luminosity problem. A cycle of episodic mass accretion, however,
can resolve this problem and bring the model predictions into better agreement
with observations. Standard assumptions about the interplay between mass
accretion and mass loss in our model give star formation efficiencies
consistent with recent observations that compare the core mass function (CMF)
and stellar initial mass function (IMF). The combination of outflow cavities
and episodic mass accretion reduce the connection between observational Class
and physical Stage to the point where neither of the two common observational
signatures (bolometric temperature and ratio of bolometric to submillimeter
luminosity) can be considered reliable indicators of physical Stage.

used. The authors designed and fabricated a BioMEMS (Biological
MicroElectro-Mechanical System) compatible with microfluidic circulation and
electromagnetic propagation. It is dedicated to the ex vivo detection of nitric
oxide synthase (NOS) activity, which is involved in neurodegenerative
phenomena. MATERIAL/METHODS: The biological model was a leech's central nervous
system. After its injury, the production of NO was observed and measured in the
far-THz spectral domain. The nerve cord was put inside a BioMEMS realized in
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) sealed on a glass wafer. Glass is a good material
for supporting high-frequency integrated waveguides such as coplanar waveguides
(CPWs). Measurements were performed with vectorial network analyser (VNA).
RESULTS: The transmission parameter in the frequency range of 0.14-0.22 THz was
measured through CPWs located just below the microchannel containing the
injured leech nerve cord. The lesion caused a decreased transmission
coefficient due to the NOS activity. L-NAME was injected inside the
microchannel and it was verified that it inhibits this activity. CONCLUSIONS:
It was demonstrated that THz spectroscopy can detect a biochemical event, such
as NOS activity around an injured leech's nerve cord, in real time. Future
studies will be dedicated to quantitative measurements of the reaction products

considerable interest in research fields ranging from sociology to computer
science and application domains such as marketing, finance, human health, and
national security. Of particular interest is the possibility to develop
predictive capabilities for social diffusion, for instance enabling early
identification of diffusion processes which are likely to become ""viral"" and
propagate to a significant fraction of the population. Recently we have shown,
using theoretical analysis, that the dynamics of social diffusion may depend
crucially upon the interactions of social network communities, that is, densely
connected groupings of individuals which have only relatively few links between
groups. This paper presents an empirical investigation of two related
hypotheses which follow from this finding: 1.) inter-community interaction is
predictive of the reach of social diffusion and 2.) dispersion of the diffusion
phenomenon across network communities is a useful early indicator that the
propagation will be ""successful"". We explore these hypotheses with case studies
involving the emergence of the Swedish Social Democratic Party at the turn of
the 20th century, the spread of the SARS virus in 2002-2003, and blogging
dynamics associated with real world protest activity. These empirical studies
demonstrate that network community-based diffusion metrics do indeed possess
predictive power, and in fact can be more useful than standard measures.

galaxy cluster and for 18 spirals in non-cluster environments. Pegasus I is a
spiral-rich cluster with a low density intracluster medium and a low galaxy
velocity dispersion. When combined with neutral hydrogen (HI) data obtained
with the Arecibo 305-m radiotelescope, acquired by Levy et al. (2007) and by
Springob et al. (2005a), we study the star formation rates in disk galaxies as
a function of their HI deficiency. To quantify HI deficiency, we use the usual
logarithmic deficiency parameter, DEF. The specific star formation rate (SSFR)
is quantified by the logarithmic flux ratio of H-alpha flux to R band flux, and
thus roughly characterizes the logarithmic SFR per unit stellar mass. We find a
clear correlation between the global SFR per unit stellar mass and DEF, such
that the SFR is lower in more HI-deficient galaxies. This correlation appears
to extend from the most gas-rich to the most gas-poor galaxies. We also find a
correlation between the central SFR per unit mass relative to the global
values, in the sense that the more HI-deficient galaxies have a higher central
SFR per unit mass relative to their global SFR values than do gas-rich
galaxies. In fact, approximately half of the HI-depleted galaxies have highly
elevated SSFRs in their central regions, indicative of a transient evolutionary
state. In addition, we find a correlation between gas-depletion and the size of
the H-alpha disk (relative to the R band disk); HI-poor galaxies have truncated
disks. Moreover, aside from the elevated central SSFR in many gas-poor spirals,
the SSFR is otherwise lower in the H-alpha disks of gas-poor galaxies than in

There are 73 conjugacy classes of $G$ in $\mathrm{GL}(3,\mathbb{Z})$. By

Yamasaki, 8 conjugacy classes of 2-groups in $\mathrm{GL}(3,\mathbb{Z})$ have

greater-than-atomic but less-than-nuclear densities which are encountered in
white dwarf stars. We focus on the density and temperature regime for which
charged spin-0 nuclei form an interacting charged Bose-Einstein condensate,
while the neutralizing electrons form a degenerate fermi gas. After a brief
introductory review, we summarize distinctive properties of the charged
condensate, such as a mass gap in the bosonic sector as well as gapless
fermionic excitations. Charged impurities placed in the condensate are screened
with great efficiency, greater than in an equivalent uncondensed plasma. We
discuss a generalization of the Friedel potential which takes into account
bosonic collective excitations in addition to the fermionic excitations. We
argue that the charged condensate could exist in helium-core white dwarf stars
and discuss the evolution of these dwarfs. Condensation would lead to a
significantly faster rate of cooling than that of carbon- or oxygen-core dwarfs
with crystallized cores. This prediction can be tested observationally:
signatures of charged condensation may have already been seen in the recently
discovered sequence of helium-core dwarfs in the nearby globular cluster NGC
6397. Sufficiently strong magnetic fields can penetrate the condensate within
Abrikosov-like vortices. We find approximate analytic vortex solutions and
calculate the values of the lower and upper critical magnetic fields at which
vortices are formed and destroyed respectively. The lower critical field is
within the range of fields observed in white dwarfs, but tends toward the
higher end of this interval. This suggests that for a significant fraction of
helium-core dwarfs, magnetic fields are entirely expelled within the core.

separated by over 2000 km/s have been observed recently. These have been
interpreted as being due to massive black hole (MBH) recoil following a black
hole merger, MBH binaries, or chance superpositions of AGN in galaxy clusters.
Moreover, a number of double-peaked AGN with velocity offsets of ~ a few 100
km/s have also been detected and interpreted as being due to the internal
kinematics of the narrow line regions or MBH binary systems. Here we reexamine
the superposition model. Using the Millennium Run we estimate the total number
of detectable AGN pairs as a function of the emission line offset. We show that
AGN pairs with high velocity line separations up to ~2000 km/s are very likely
to be chance superpositions of two AGN in clusters of galaxies for reasonable
assumptions about the relative fraction of AGN. No superimposed AGN pairs are
predicted for velocity offsets in excess of ~3000 km/s as the required AGN
fractions would violate observational constraints. The high velocity AGN pair
numbers predicted here are competitive with those predicted from the models
relying on MBH recoil or MBH binaries. However, the model fails to account for
the largest emission line velocity offsets that require the presence of MBH
binaries.

q is a matrix of formal variables defining the phase space braidings between

the Planck-Boltzmann constants (hbar and k_B) to be introduced back into the
classical formulae. Being applied to statistical physics, this naturally leads
to an idea to go further and to replace the Boltzmann constant with an infinite
collection of generators of the so-called epoch\'e (bracketing) algebra. The
latter is an infinite dimensional noncommutative algebra recently introduced in
our previous work, which can be perceived as an infinite sequence of

genome to discover the frequency of transcripts, miRNAs, DNAase hypersensitive
sites, FAIRE regions, nucleosome occupancy, etc. Since these reads are
typically short (e.g., 36 base pairs) and since many eukaryotic genomes,
including humans, have highly repetitive sequences then many of these reads map
to two or more locations in the genome. Current mapping of these reads, grading
them according to 0, 1 or 2 mismatches wastes a great deal of information.
These short sequences are typically mapped with no account of the accuracy of
the sequence, even in company software when per base error rates are being
reported by another part of the machine. Further, multiply mapping locations
are frequently discarded altogether or allocated with no regard to where other
reads are accumulating. Here we show how to combine probabilistic mapping of
reads with an EM algorithm to iteratively improve the empirical likelihood of
the allocation of short reads. Mapping using LAST takes into account the per
base accuracy of the read, plus insertions and deletions, plus anticipated
occasional errors or SNPs with respect to the parent genome. The probabilistic
EM algorithm iteratively allocates reads based on the proportion of reads
mapping within windows on the previous cycle, along with any prior information
on where the read best maps. The methods are illustrated with FAIRE ENCODE data

near the force-free surface. The particle energy far from the force-free
surface has been found to be determined by the balance between the power of the
forces of an accelerating electric field and the intensity of curvature
radiation. When captured, the particles perform adiabatic oscillations along
the magnetic field lines and simultaneously move along the force-free surface.
We have found the oscillation parameters and trajectories of the captured
particles. We have calculated the characteristic capture times and energy
losses of the particles through the emission of both bremsstrahlung and

nonlinear optical response can be utilized for imaging purposes, with image
contrasts of graphene which are orders of magnitude higher than those obtained
using linear microscopy.

  driven by configurational forces","21 pages",,,,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the present article, we are interested in an initial boundary value
problem for a coupled system of partial differential equations arising in
martensitic phase transition theory of elastically deformable solid materials,
e.g., steel. This model was proposed and investigated in previous work by Alber
and Zhu in which the weak solutions are defined in a standard way, however the
key technique is not applicable to multi-dimensional problem. Intending to
solve this multi-dimensional problem and to investigate the sharp interface
limits of our models, we thus define weak solutions in a different way by using
the notion of viscosity solution, then prove the existence of weak solutions to
this problem in one space dimension, yet the multi-dimensional problem is still
open.

Functional Causality for Explaining Query Answers","18 pages, 15 figures",,,"University of Washington CSE Technical Report 09-12-01","cs.DB cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose causality as a unified framework to explain query
answers and non-answers, thus generalizing and extending several previously
proposed approaches of provenance and missing query result explanations.
  We develop our framework starting from the well-studied definition of actual
causes by Halpern and Pearl. After identifying some undesirable characteristics
of the original definition, we propose functional causes as a refined
definition of causality with several desirable properties. These properties
allow us to apply our notion of causality in a database context and apply it
uniformly to define the causes of query results and their individual
contributions in several ways: (i) we can model both provenance as well as
non-answers, (ii) we can define explanations as either data in the input
relations or relational operations in a query plan, and (iii) we can give
graded degrees of responsibility to individual causes, thus allowing us to rank
causes. In particular, our approach allows us to explain contributions to
relational aggregate functions and to rank causes according to their respective
responsibilities. We give complexity results and describe polynomial algorithms
for evaluating causality in tractable cases. Throughout the paper, we
illustrate the applicability of our framework with several examples.
  Overall, we develop in this paper the theoretical foundations of causality
theory in a database context.

Throughout
this report, we place emphasis on the contribution of lattice results to our
understanding of a number of fundamental physics questions related to, e.g.,
the origin and distribution of the charge, magnetization, momentum and spin of
hadrons. Following an introduction to some of the most important hadron
structure observables, we summarize the methods and techniques employed for
their calculation in lattice QCD. We briefly discuss the status of relevant
chiral perturbation theory calculations needed for controlled extrapolations of
the lattice results to the physical point. In the main part of this report, we
give an overview of lattice calculations on hadron form factors, moments of
(generalized) parton distributions, moments of hadron distribution amplitudes,
and other important hadron structure observables. Whenever applicable, we
compare with results from experiment and phenomenology, taking into account
systematic uncertainties in the lattice computations. Finally, we discuss
promising results based on new approaches, ideas and techniques, and close with
remarks on future perspectives of the field.
