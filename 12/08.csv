four-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime is holographic dual to conformally
invariant composite Dirac fermion metal. By utilizing S-duality map, we show
that thermodynamic and transport properties of the black hole match with those
of composite fermion metal, exhibiting Fermi liquid-like. Built upon
Dirac-Schwinger-Zwanziger quantization condition, we argue that turning on
magnetic charges to electric black hole along the orbit of Gamma(2) subgroup of
SL(2,Z) is equivalent to attaching even unit of statistical flux quanta to
constituent fermions. Being at metallic point, the statistical magnetic flux is
interlocked to the background magnetic field. We find supporting evidences for
proposed holographic duality from study of internal energy of black hole and
probe bulk fermion motion in black hole background. They show good agreement
with ground-state energy of composite fermion metal in Thomas-Fermi
approximation and cyclotron motion of a constituent or composite fermion
excitation near Fermi-point.

light colored SU(2) singlet (Delta_6) and a color octet weak doublet (Delta_1)

400 GeV, while Delta_1 is then constrained to have a mass around the TeV scale

with the same final radial flow. These results provide an alternative picture
of freeze-outs: a thermalized system is produced at partonic phase; the
hadronic scattering at later stage is not enough to maintain the system in
equilibrium and does not increase the radial flow of the copiously produced
light hadrons. The J/psi in Pb+Pb collisions at SPS is consistent with early
decoupling and obtains little radial flow. The J/psi spectra at RHIC are also
inconsistent with the bulk flow profile.

the source in the whole range, for the first time in the radio band at 4.86 and
8.46 GHz and in the mid-IR at 24 um, up to 100 keV. The optically thick

the mid-IR band. The flat jet spectrum breaks in the range (1-4)x10^(13) Hz to
an optically-thin power-law synchrotron spectrum with spectral index ~-0.5.
These observations allow us to estimate a lower limit on the jet radiative
power of ~3x10^(32) erg/s and a total jet power Lj~10^(34) u_(0.05)^(-1)
Ec^(0.53) erg/s (where Ec is the high-energy cutoff of the synchrotron spectrum

multi-color evanescent field surrounding an optical nanofiber. The atoms are
localized in a one-dimensional optical lattice about 200 nm above the nanofiber
surface and can be efficiently interrogated with a resonant light field sent
through the nanofiber. Our technique opens the route towards the direct
integration of laser-cooled atomic ensembles within fiber networks, an
important prerequisite for large scale quantum communication schemes. Moreover,
it is ideally suited to the realization of hybrid quantum systems that combine
atoms with, e.g., solid state quantum devices.

possibility to use stereoscopic methods to reconstruct the 3D solar corona.
Classical stereoscopy works best for solid objects with clear edges.
Consequently an application of classical stereoscopic methods to the faint
structures visible in the optically thin coronal plasma is by no means straight
forward and several problems have to be treated adequately: 1.)First there is
the problem of identifying one dimensional structures -e.g. active region
coronal loops or polar plumes- from the two individual EUV-images observed with
STEREO/EUVI. 2.) As a next step one has the association problem to find
corresponding structures in both images. 3.) Within the reconstruction problem
stereoscopic methods are used to compute the 3D-geometry of the identified
structures. Without any prior assumptions, e.g., regarding the footpoints of
coronal loops, the reconstruction problem has not one unique solution. 4.) One
has to estimate the reconstruction error or accuracy of the reconstructed
3D-structure, which depends on the accuracy of the identified structures in 2D,
the separation angle between the spacecraft, but also on the location, e.g.,
for east-west directed coronal loops the reconstruction error is highest close
to the loop top. 5.) Eventually we are not only interested in the 3D-geometry
of loops or plumes, but also in physical parameters like density, temperature,
plasma flow, magnetic field strength etc. Helpful for treating some of these
problems are coronal magnetic field models extrapolated from photospheric
measurements, because observed EUV-loops outline the magnetic field. This
feature has been used for a new method dubbed 'magnetic stereoscopy'. As
examples we show recent application to active region loops.

remove finite-radius approximations and the need to extrapolate data from the

thus is affected only by numerical error. Various consistency checks reveal
that energy and angular momentum are conserved to high precision and agree very
well with extrapolated data. In addition, we revisit the computation of the
gravitational recoil and find that finite radius extrapolation very well
approximates the result at $\scri$. However, the (non-convergent) systematic
differences to extrapolated data are of the same order of magnitude as the
(convergent) discretisation error of the Cauchy evolution hence highlighting
the need for correct wave-extraction.

always been through indirect measurements: there is not a chance that we may
ever directly check its validity, and therefore, in order to assert its
factuality with increasing level of confidence, it is required that we compare
its predictions not only to observations, but also to as many contenders as
possible. Among other categories of possible models, we wish to put the

temperature distribution, we associate a Riemannian material manifold to the
body, with a metric that explicitly depends on the temperature distribution. A
change of temperature corresponds to a change of the material metric. In this
sense, a temperature change is a concrete example of the so-called referential
evolutions. We also make a concrete connection between our geometric point of
view and the multiplicative decomposition of deformation gradient into thermal
and elastic parts. We study the stress-free temperature distributions of the
finite-deformation theory using curvature tensor of the material manifold. We
find the zero-stress temperature distributions in nonlinear elasticity. Given
an equilibrium configuration, we show that a change of the material manifold,
i.e. a change of the material metric will change the equilibrium configuration.
In the case of a temperature change, this means that given an equilibrium
configuration for a given temperature distribution, a change of temperature
will change the equilibrium configuration. We obtain the explicit form of the
governing partial differential equations for this equilibrium change. We also
show that geometric linearization of the present nonlinear theory leads to
governing equations that are identical to those of the classical linear theory
of thermal stresses.

encounters on the evolution of a Jovian-mass giant planet forming within a
protoplanetary disc. We consider the effect on both the mass accretion and the
migration history as a function of encounter distance. We use a grid-based
hydrodynamics code to perform 2D simulations of a system consisting of a giant
planet embedded within a gaseous disc orbiting around a star, which is
perturbed by a passing star on a prograde, parabolic orbit. The disc model
extends out to 50 AU, and parabolic encounters are considered with impact
parameters ranging from 100 - 250 AU. In agreement with previous work, we find
that the disc is significantly tidally truncated for encounters < 150 AU, and
the removal of angular momentum from the disc by the passing star causes a
substantial inflow of gas through the disc. The gap formed by the embedded
planet becomes flooded with gas, causing the gas accretion rate onto the planet
to increase abruptly. Gas flow through the gap, and into the inner disc, causes
the positive inner disc torques exerted on the planet to increase, resulting in
a sustained period of outward migration. For weaker interactions, corresponding
to an encounter distance of > 250 AU, we find that the planet-disc system
experiences minimal perturbation. Our results indicate that stellar fly-bys in
young clusters may significantly modify the masses and orbital parameters of
giant planets forming within protostellar discs. Planets that undergo such
encounters are expected to be more massive, and to orbit with larger semimajor
axes, than planets in systems which have not experienced parabolic encounters.

This setup is the simplest realistic model system which provides a complete
description of the (interatomic) dipole-dipole interaction for arbitrary
orientation of the interatomic distance vector, and at the same time allows for
intraatomic spontaneously generated coherences. We discuss different methods to
analyze the contribution of the various vacuum-induced coupling constants to
the total resonance fluorescence spectrum. These allow us to find a dressed
state interpretation of the contribution of the different interatomic
dipole-dipole couplings to the total spectrum. We further study the role of the
spontaneously generated coherences, and identify two different contributions to
the single-particle vacuum-induced couplings. We show that they have a
noticeable impact on the total resonance fluorescence spectrum down to small
interatomic distances, even though the dipole-dipole couplings constants then
are much larger in magnitude than the the single-particle coupling constants.
Interestingly, we find that the interatomic couplings can induce an effect of
the intraatomic spontaneously generated coherences on the observed spectra
which is not present in single-atom systems.

  We describe the complete system for acquiring this model. The video is
captured from a helicopter and stabilized by warping the images to match an
orthorectified image of the area. A pixel classifier is applied to the
stabilized images, and the response is segmented to determine car locations and
orientations. The results are fed in to a tracking scheme which tracks cars for
three frames, creating tracklets. This allows the tracker to use a combination
of velocity, direction, appearance, and acceleration cues to keep only tracks
likely to be correct. Each tracklet provides a measurement of the car velocity
at every point along the tracklet's length, and these are then aggregated to
create a histogram of vehicle velocities at every pixel in the image.

be used to infer a variety of information about road lane directions, speed
limits, vehicle speeds and common trajectories, and traffic bottlenecks, as
well as providing a means of describing environmental knowledge about traffic
rules that can be used in tracking.

is sufficiently large for a wide range of $Q$ around the $Z^0$ pole, and even
with the lepton pair's invariant mass integrated from Q=70 GeV to 110 GeV, the
$A_N$ is still close to 10 percent for the central and near forward rapidity
region. We argue that the SSAs of Drell-Yan inclusive dilepton production at
low $Q$ and that near the $Z^0$ pole provide complementary information for
testing the time-reversal modified universality (the sign change) of the Sivers
functions.

equilibrium, and the flux of produced neutrinos is governed by the
sneutrino-proton elastic scattering cross section, which has an upper bound of
$8 \times 10^{-9}$ pb from the $Z^{\prime}$ mass limits in the $B-L$ model.
Despite the absence of any spin-dependent contribution, the muon event rates
predicted by this model can be detected at IceCube since sneutrinos mainly
annihilate into leptonic final states by virtue of the fermion $B-L$ charges.
These subsequently decay to neutrinos with 100% efficiency. The Earth muon
event rates are too small to be detected for the standard halo model
irrespective of an enhanced sneutrino annihilation cross section that can
explain the recent PAMELA data. For modified velocity distributions, the Earth
muon events increase substantially and can be greater than the IceCube
detection threshold of 12 events $\mathrm{km}^{-2}$ $\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$.
However, this only leads to a mild increase of about 30% for the Sun muon
events. The number of muon events from the Sun can be as large as roughly 100
events $\mathrm{km}^{-2}$ $\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ for this model.

  For the general unrelated machine activation problem, our main results are
that if there is a schedule with makespan $T$ and activation cost $A$ then we
can obtain a schedule with makespan $\makespanconstant T$ and activation cost
$\costconstant A$, for any $\epsilon >0$. We also consider assignment costs for

  For the uniformly related parallel machine scheduling problem, we develop a
polynomial time approximation scheme that outputs a schedule with the property
that the activation cost of the subset of machines is at most $A$ and the

resulting problem is constrained to also satisfy a bit error rate requirement

to noise plus interference ratio feedback of both links. The problem is then
cast as a nonlinear discrete optimization problem for which a fast and
efficient suboptimum solution is presented. We also present a scheme with rate
adaptive and constant power cognitive radio. An important characteristic of the

measure the cluster mass profiles. We do so by performing realistic simulations
of lensing and X-ray observations that are subsequently analyzed using
observational techniques. The resulting mass estimates are compared among them
and with the input models. Three clusters obtained from state-of-the-art
hydrodynamical simulations, each of which has been projected along three
independent lines-of-sight, are used for this analysis. We find that strong
lensing models can be trusted over a limited region around the cluster core.
Extrapolating the strong lensing mass models to outside the Einstein ring can
lead to significant biases in the mass estimates, if the BCG is not modeled
properly for example. Weak lensing mass measurements can be largely affected by
substructures, depending on the method implemented to convert the shear into a
mass estimate. Using non-parametric methods which combine weak and strong
lensing data, the projected masses within R200 can be constrained with a
precision of ~10%. De-projection of lensing masses increases the scatter around
the true masses by more than a factor of two due to cluster triaxiality. X-ray
mass measurements have much smaller scatter (about a factor of two smaller than
the lensing masses) but they are generally biased low by 5-20%. This bias is
ascribable to bulk motions in the gas of our simulated clusters. Using the
lensing and the X-ray masses as proxies for the true and the hydrostatic
equilibrium masses of the simulated clusters and averaging over the cluster
sample we are able to measure the lack of hydrostatic equilibrium in the
systems we have investigated.

halos hosting DLAs retain up to 20% of the cosmic baryon fraction in the form
of neutral hydrogen, and that star formation at the centre of the halos is
responsible for the faint Lyalpha emission. The scattering of a significant
fraction of the Lyalpha emission to the observed radii, which can be as large
as 50 kpc or more, requires the amplitude of the bulk motions of the gas at the
centre of the halos to be moderate. The observed space density and size
distribution of the emitters together with the incidence rate of DLAs suggests
that the Lyalpha emission due to star formation has a duty cycle of ~ 25%.

communication systems is discussed from the perspective of communication
theory. I argue that inter-human communication takes place at two levels. At
the first level information is exchanged and provided with meaning and at the
second level meaning can reflexively be communicated. Human language can be
considered as the evolutionary achievement which enables us to use these two
channels of communication simultaneously. Providing meaning from the
perspective of hindsight is a recursive operation: a meaning that makes a
difference can be considered as knowledge. If the production of knowledge is
socially organized, the perspective of hindsight can further be codified. This
adds globalization to the historically stabilized patterns of communications.
Globalization can be expected to transform the communications in an
evolutionary mode. However, the self-organization of a knowledge-based society
remains an expectation with the status of a hypothesis.

anisotropies and heat fluxes that must be calculated from microscopic plasma

pressure anisotropy or the heat fluxes, one finds the macroscale dynamics to be
generically unstable to microscale Alfvenically polarized fluctuations. Two
instabilities are considered in detail: the parallel firehose instability
(including the finite-Larmor-radius effects that determine the fastest growing
mode) and the gyrothermal instability (GTI). The latter is a new result - it is
shown that a parallel ion heat flux destabilizes Alfvenically polarized
fluctuations even in the absence of the negative pressure anisotropy required
for the firehose. The main conclusion is that both pressure anisotropies and
heat fluxes trigger plasma microinstabilities and, therefore, their values will
likely be set by the nonlinear evolution of these instabilities. Ideas for
understanding this nonlinear evolution are discussed. It is argued that cosmic
plasmas will generically be ""three-scale systems,"" comprising global dynamics,
mesoscale turbulence and microscale plasma fluctuations. The astrophysical
example of cool cores of galaxy clusters is considered and it is noted that
observations point to turbulence in clusters being in a marginal state with

dependencies on azimuthal angle $\phi$ and impact parameter $b$ for pion
production at high $p_T$ essentially independent of the hadronization process.
The scaling variable is in terms of a dynamical path length $\xi$ that takes
into account detailed properties of geometry, medium density and probability of
hard scattering. It is shown in the recombination model how the nuclear
modification factor depends on the average $\bar\xi(\phi,b)$. The data for
$\pi^0$ production at $p_T=$ 4-5 and 7-8 GeV/c at RHIC are shown to exhibit the
same scaling behavior as found in the model calculation. Extension to
back-to-back dijet production has been carried out, showing the existence of
$\bar\xi$ scaling also in the away-side yield per trigger. At LHC the
hard-parton density can be high enough to realize the likelihood of
recombination of shower partons arising from neighboring jets. It is shown that
such 2-jet recombination can cause strong violation of $\bar\xi$ scaling.
Furthermore, the large value of $R_{AA}$ that exceeds 1 can become a striking
signature of such a hadronization process at high energy.

coefficient distributions. The Fourier transform (FT) of an image contains a
complete description of the image, and the values of the FT coefficients are
uniquely associated with that image. For an image where the distribution of
pixels is uncorrelated, the FT coefficients are normally distributed and
uncorrelated. Further, the probability distribution for the FT coefficients of
such an image can readily be obtained by Parseval's theorem. We take advantage
of these properties to compute the spatial information in an image by
determining the probability of each coefficient (both real and imaginary parts)
in the FT, then using the Shannon formalism to calculate information. By using
the probability distribution obtained from Parseval's theorem, an effective
distance from the completely uncorrelated or most uncertain case is obtained.
The resulting quantity is an information computed in k-space (kSI). This
approach provides a robust, facile and highly flexible framework for
quantifying spatial information in images and other types of data (of arbitrary
dimensions). The kSI metric is tested on a 2D Ising ferromagnet, and the
temperature-dependent phase transition is accurately determined from the
spatial information in configurations of the system.

public crisis. Understanding its spreading dynamics is of fundamental
importance for both public health and scientific researches. Recent studies
have focused mainly on evaluation and prediction of on-going spreading, which
strongly depends on detailed information about the structure of social
contacts, human traveling patterns and biological activity of virus, etc.
  Methodology/Principal Findings: In this work we analyzed the distributions of
confirmed cases of influenza A (H1N1) in different levels and find the Zipf's
law and Heaps' law. Similar scaling properties were also observed for severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and bird cases of H5N1. We also found a
hierarchical spreading pattern from countries with larger population and GDP to
countries with smaller ones. We proposed a model that considers generic control
effects on both the local growth and transregional transmission, without the
need of the above mentioned detailed information. We studied in detail the
impact of control effects and heterogeneity on the spreading dynamics in the
model and showed that they are responsible for the scaling and hierarchical
spreading properties observed in empirical data.
  Conclusions/Significance: Our analysis and modeling showed that although
strict control measures for interregional travelers could delay the outbreak in
the regions without local cases, the focus should be turned to local prevention
after the outbreak of local cases. Target control on a few regions with the
largest number of active interregional travelers can efficiently prevent the
spreading. This work provided not only a deeper understanding of the generic
mechanisms underlying the spread of infectious diseases, but also some
practical guidelines for decision makers to adopt suitable control strategies.

have something in common, that NEO theory may hold the key to solving some
vexing problems in deterministic optimization: local trapping and proof of
convergence. CFO analogizes Newton's laws to locate the global maxima of a
function. The NEO-CFO nexus is the striking similarity between CFO's Davg and
an NEO's Delta-V curves. Both exhibit oscillatory plateau-like regions
connected by jumps, suggesting that CFO's metaphorical ""gravity"" indeed behaves
like real gravity, thereby connecting NEOs and CFO and being the basis for
speculating that NEO theory may address difficult issues in optimization.

was deemed to be invariant and the kinetic equations were developed with this
assumption. A reason for these developments was the ease in which linear graphs
could be plotted. Here, different methods are discussed that does not require
exact knowledge of initial concentrations and which require elementary
nonlinear analysis and the ensuing results are compared with those derived from
the standard methodology from an actual chemical reaction, with its
experimental determination of the initial concentration with a degree of

by taking into account influence of the external force/torque acting upon the

compliance of manipulator elements by a set of localized six-dimensional
springs separated by rigid links and perfect joints. In contrast to the
conventional formulation, which is valid for the unloaded mode and small
displacements, the proposed approach implicitly assumes that the loading leads
to the non-negligible changes of the manipulator posture and corresponding
amendment of the Jacobian. The developed numerical technique allows computing
the static equilibrium and relevant force/torque reaction of the manipulator
for any given displacement of the end-effector. This enables designer detecting
essentially nonlinear effects in elastic behavior of manipulator, similar to
the buckling of beam elements. It is also proposed the linearization procedure
that is based on the inversion of the dedicated matrix composed of the
stiffness parameters of the virtual springs and the Jacobians/Hessians of the
active and passive joints. The developed technique is illustrated by an
application example that deals with the stiffness analysis of a parallel

potential to greatly reduce drag and enhance mixing phenomena in microfluidic
devices. Recent work has focused on idealized cases of stick-perfect slip
stripes, with limited guidance. Here, we analyze the experimentally relevant
situation of a pressure-driven flow past striped slip-stick surfaces with
arbitrary local slip at the gas sectors. We derive analytical formulas for
maximal (longitudinal) and minimal (transverse) directional effective slip
lengths that can be used for any surface slip fraction (validated by numerical
calculations). By representing eigenvalues of the slip length-tensor, they
allow us to obtain the effective slip for any orientation of stripes with
respect to the mean flow. Our results imply that flow past stripes is
controlled by the ratio of the local slip length to texture size. In case of a
large (compared to the texture period) slip at the gas areas, surface
anisotropy leads to a tensorial effective slip, by attaining the values
predicted earlier for a perfect local slip. Both effective slip lengths and
anisotropy of the flow decrease when local slip becomes of the order of texture
period. In the case of small slip, we predict simple surface-averaged,
isotropic flows (independent of orientation). These results provide a framework
for the rational design of super-hydrophobic surfaces and devices.

in their centres, just like galaxies do. The well-established correlations
between the supermassive black holes and their host galaxies do suggest that,
in extrapolation, globular clusters (GCs) follow the same relations. Most of
the attempts in search of the central black holes (BHs) are not direct and

microlensing of the cluster stars by the central BH. If the core of the cluster
is resolved, the direct determination of the lensing curve and lensing system
parameters are possible; if unresolved, the differential imaging technique can
be applied. We calculate the optical depth to central BH microlensing for a
selected list of Galactic GCs and estimate the average time duration of the
events. We present the observational strategy and discuss the detectability of
microlensing events using a 2-m class telescope.

potential, $\mu$, has a rich phase structure: at low $T$ and low $\mu$, the
Nambu-Goldstone (NG) phase with nearly massless pions is realized by the
dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry through condensation of quark-anti-quark
pairs, while, at low $T$ and high $\mu$, a Fermi liquid of deconfined quarks is
expected to appear as a consequence of asymptotic freedom. Furthermore, in such
a cold quark matter, condensation of quark-quark pairs leads to the color
superconductivity (CSC). At high $T$ for arbitrary $\mu$, all the condensates
melt away and a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is realized. The experimental
exploration of thermal phase transition from the NG phase to QGP is being
actively pursued in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions at RHIC
(Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider), and will be continued in the future at LHC
(Large Hadron Collider). The quantum phase transition from the NG phase to the
CSC at low $T$ is also relevant to heavy-ion collisions at moderate energies,
and is of interest in the interiors of neutron stars and possible quark stars.
In this Chapter, after a brief introduction to the basic properties of QCD, the
current status of the QCD phase structure and associated quantum phase
transitions will be summarized with particular emphasis on the symmetry
realization of each phase. Possible connection between the physics of QCD and
that of ultracold atoms is also discussed.

Lesser Eruption (LE) at the end of the 19th century occurred when the system
was very close to periastron passage, suggesting that the secondary triggered
the LE. We assume that the 1838-1858 Great Eruption (GE) was triggered by a
periastron passage as well. We also assume that mass transferred from the
primary to the secondary star accounts for the extra energy of the GE. With
these assumptions we constrain the total mass of the binary system to be
M=M_1+M_2>~250 solar masses. These higher than commonly used masses better
match the observed luminosity with stellar evolutionary tracks. Including mass
loss by the two stars and mass transfer from the primary to the secondary we
obtain a good match of periastron passages to the two peaks in the light curve
of the GE. Based on these finding and a similar behavior of P Cygni, we
speculate that major LBV eruptions are triggered by stellar companions, and
that in extreme cases a short duration event with a huge mass transfer rate can
lead to a bright transient event on time scales of weeks to months (a
``supernova impostor'').

distant galaxy distribution due to the aberration effect. However, the
amplitude and angular direction of the effect is not necessarily the same as
those of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole anisotropy due to the
growth of cosmic structures. In other words exploring the aberration effect may
give us a clue to the horizon-scale physics perhaps related to the cosmic
acceleration. In this paper we develop a method to explore the dipole angular
modulation from the pixelized galaxy data on the sky properly taking into
account the covariances due to the shot noise and the intrinsic galaxy
clustering contamination as well as the partial sky coverage. We applied the
method to the galaxy catalogs constructed from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) Data Release 6 data. After constructing the four galaxy catalogs that
are different in the ranges of magnitudes and photometric redshifts to study
possible systematics, we found that the most robust sample against systematics
indicates no dipole anisotropy in the galaxy distribution. This finding is
consistent with the expectation from the concordance Lambda-dominated cold dark
matter model. Finally we argue that an almost full-sky galaxy survey such as
LSST may allow for a significant detection of the aberration effect of the CMB
dipole having the precision of constraining the angular direction to ~ 20
degrees in radius. Assuming a hypothetical LSST galaxy survey, we find that
this method can confirm or reject the result implied from a stacked analysis of
the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect of X-ray luminous clusters in Kashlinsky
et al. (2008,2009) if the implied cosmic bulk flow is not extended out to the
horizon.

structures in nearby galaxies and to test the cosmological evolution of their
large- and small-scale magnetic fields with the SKA and its precursors. We
estimate the required density of the background polarized sources detected with
the SKA for reliable reconstruction and reconstruction of magnetic field
structures in nearby spiral galaxies. The dynamo theory is applied to distant
galaxies to explore the evolution of magnetic fields in distant galaxies in the
context of a hierarchical dark matter cosmology. Under favorite conditions, a
\emph{recognition} of large-scale magnetic structures in local star-forming
disk galaxies (at a distance $\la 100$ Mpc) is possible from $\ga 10$ RMs
towards background polarized sources. Galaxies with strong turbulence or small
inclination need more polarized sources for a statistically reliable
recognition. A reliable \emph{reconstruction} of the field structure without
precognition needs at least 20 RM values on a cut along the projected minor
axis which translates to $\approx1200$ sources towards the galaxy. We
demonstrate that early regular fields are already in place at $z \sim 4$
(approximately 1.5 Gyr after the disk formation) in massive gas-rich galaxies
($>10^9$ M$_{\sun}$) which then evolve to Milky-Way type galaxies. Major and

two-dimensional (2D) discrete model, which includes the on-site nonlinearity
and cubic long-range (DD) interactions between sites of the lattice. We
consider two such models, that differ by the form of the on-site nonlinearity,
represented by the usual cubic term, or more accurate nonpolynomial one,
derived from the underlying 3D Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Similar results are
obtained for both models. The analysis is focused on effects of the DD
interaction on fundamental localized modes in the lattice (2D discrete
solitons). The repulsive isotropic DD nonlinearity extends the existence and
stability regions of the fundamental solitons. New families of on-site,
inter-site and hybrid solitons, built on top of a finite background, are found
as a result of the interplay of the isotropic repulsive DD interaction and
attractive contact nonlinearity. By themselves, these solutions are unstable,
but they evolve into robust breathers which exist on an oscillating background.
In the presence of the repulsive contact interactions, fundamental localized
modes exist if the DD interaction (attractive isotropic or anisotropic) is
strong enough. They are stable in narrow regions close to the anticontinuum
limit, while unstable solitons evolve into breathers. In the latter case, the
presence of the background is immaterial.

conditions for the source's evolution during the original jet propagation
through the unperturbed IGM, as well as those when the restarted new jet
propagates inside the outer cocoon formed by the old jet material that passed
through the jet terminal shock. The dynamical age estimate of the outer and the
inner lobes is 132+/-28 Myr and ~9+/-4 Myr, respectively. The synchrotron age
in the outer lobes systematically rises from ~25 Myr in the vicinity of the
lobes' edges to about 65-75 Myr in the centre of the old cocoon. These ages
imply an average expansion speed along the jets' axis: (0.012+/-0.003)c in the
outer lobes and (0.058+/-0.025)c in the inner lobes, but the latter speed would
be ~0.25c when they were of age less than 1 Myr. We find that the jet power
during the restarted activity is about ten-fold fainter than that of the

magnetic field strengths in the old cocoon and those in the inner lobes. This
disproportion can be effectively reduced by assuming the same equations of
state for the emitting particles and the magnetic fields within the old and the

low-temperature states of matter are fundamentally dependent on the
dimensionality of physical systems. Generally, highly ordered states are more
robust in higher dimensions, while thermal and quantum fluctuations, which
favour disordered states, play a more important role in lower dimensions. The
case of a two-dimensional (2d) Bose fluid is particularly fascinating because
of its ""marginal"" behaviour. In an infinite uniform 2d fluid thermal
fluctuations at any non-zero temperature are strong enough to destroy the fully
ordered state associated with Bose--Einstein condensation, but are not strong
enough to suppress superfluidity in an interacting system at low, but non-zero
temperatures. Further, the presence of residual ""quasi-long-range"" order at low
temperatures leads to an interesting interplay between superfluidity and
condensation in all experimentally relevant finite-size systems. In these notes
we give an introduction to the physics of 2d Bose fluids from an atomic physics
perspective. Our goal is to summarize the recent progress in theoretical
understanding and experimental investigation of ultra-cold atomic gases

formed by the shadowing mechanism are shown to have rather different velocity

flash, which takes place at the tip of the red giant branch (RGB) and is
followed by a series of secondary flashes before the star settles into the
zero-age horizontal branch (ZAHB). Yet, no stars have been positively
identified in this key evolutionary phase, mainly for two reasons: first, this
pre-ZAHB phase is very short compared to other major evolutionary phases in the
life of a star; and second, these pre-ZAHB stars are expected to overlap the
loci occupied by asymptotic giant branch (AGB), HB and RGB stars observed in
the color-magnitude diagram (CMD). We investigate the possibility of detecting
these stars through stellar pulsations, since some of them are expected to
rapidly cross the Cepheid/RR Lyrae instability strip in their route from the
RGB tip to the ZAHB, thus becoming pulsating stars along the way. As a
consequence of their very high evolutionary speed, some of these stars may
present anomalously large period change rates. We constructed an extensive grid
of stellar models and produced pre-ZAHB Monte Carlo simulations appropriate for
the case of the Galactic globular cluster M3 (NGC 5272), where a number of RR
Lyrae stars with high period change rates are found. Our results suggest that
some -- but certainly not all -- of the RR Lyrae stars in M3 with large period
change rates are in fact pre-ZAHB pulsators.

expoiting the representation theory of semi-simple Lie algebras. Let $M$ be a
finite dimensional representation of a semi-simple Lie algebra and let $B$ be
the associated Kashiwara crystal. For $r\ge 0$, the triple $(X,c,P)$ which
exhibits the cyclic sieving phenomenon is constructed as follows: the set $X$
is the set of isolated vertices in the crystal $\otimes^rB$; the map $c\colon
X\rightarrow X$ is a generalisation of promotion acting on standard tableaux of
rectangular shape and the polynomial $P$ is the fake degree of the Frobenius
character of a representation of $\mathfrak{S}_r$ related to the natural action
of $\mathfrak{S}_r$ on the subspace of invariant tensors in $\otimes^rM$.
Taking $M$ to be the defining representation of $\mathrm{SL}(n)$ gives the
cyclic sieving phenomenon for rectangular tableaux.

understanding the structure of the solar corona. We compute the field in the
higher layers of the solar atmosphere from the measured photospheric field
under the assumption that the corona is force-free. Aims: Here we develop a
method for nonlinear force-free coronal magnetic field medelling and
preprocessing of photospheric vector magnetograms in spherical geometry using
the optimization procedure. Methods: We describe a newly developed code for the
extrapolation of nonlinear force-free coronal magnetic fields in spherical
coordinates over a restricted area of the Sun. The program uses measured vector
magnetograms on the solar photosphere as input and solves the force-free
equations in the solar corona. We develop a preprocessing procedure in
spherical geometry to drive the observed non-force-free data towards suitable
boundary conditions for a force-free extrapolation. Results: We test the code
with the help of a semi-analytic solution and assess the quality of our
reconstruction qualitatively by magnetic field line plots and quantitatively
with a number of comparison metrics for different boundary conditions. The
reconstructed fields from the lower boundary data with the weighting function
are in good agreement with the original reference fields. We added artificial
noise to the boundary conditions and tested the code with and without
preprocessing. The preprocessing recovered all main structures of the
magnetogram and removed small-scale noise. The main test was to extrapolate
from the noisy photospheric vector magnetogram with and without preprocessing.
The preprocessing was found to significantly improve the agreement between the
extrapolated and the exact field.

the response to a point particle source, and discuss in what sense the
solutions of Hermitian Gravity reduce to the Newtonian potentials. In a rather
intriguing way, the Hermitian Gravity solutions exhibit a generalized
reciprocity symmetry originally proposed by Born in the 1930s. Finally, we
consider the trajectories of massive and massless particles under the influence
of a potential. The theory correctly reproduces the Newtonian limit in three
dimensions and the nonrelativistic acceleration equation. However, it differs
from the light deflection calculated in linearized generalrelativity by 25%.
While the specific complexification of general relativity by extension to
Hermitian spaces performed here does not agree with experiment, it does possess
useful properties for quantization and is well-behaved around singularities.
Another form of complex general relativity may very well agree with

is achieved through two innovations: first, optical squeezed states are
utilized instead of coherent states. Secondly, the amplitudes of the bright

is a strategy reminiscent of classical repeaters and would be impossible in
single-photon-based schemes.
