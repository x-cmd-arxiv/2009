wormhole spacetimes. These spacetimes have multiple asymptotic regions which
are separated from each other by horizons. Each such region is isometric to the
BTZ black hole and there is non-trivial spacetime topology hidden behind the
horizons. We show that application of the real-time gauge/gravity duality

state capturing the non-trivial topology behind the horizons. We also show that
these spacetimes are in correspondence with trivalent graphs and provide an

effective model are significantly different; in the (Polyakov-loop coupled)
Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model we find that the critical mass is about one
order of magnitude smaller than the value reported in the Lattice QCD case. It
is known in the Lattice QCD study that the critical mass goes smaller in the
continuum limit along the temporal direction. To investigate the temporal
UV-cutoff effects quantitatively we consider the (P)NJL model with only finite
$N_\tau$ Matsubara frequencies taken in the summation. We confirm that the
critical mass in such a UV-tamed NJL model becomes larger with decreasing
$N_\tau$, which demonstrates a correct tendency to explain the difference
between the Lattice QCD and chiral model results.

originate from cosmologically-common 5:1 encounters between initially-thin
primary disk galaxies and infalling satellites. The growing thin disks are
modeled as static gravitational potentials and we explore a variety of
growing-disk parameters that are likely to influence the response of thick
disks. We find that the final thick-disk properties depend strongly on the
total mass and radial scale-length of the growing thin disk, and much less
sensitively on its growth timescale and vertical scale-height as well as the
initial sense of thick-disk rotation. Overall, the growth of an embedded thin
disk can cause a substantial contraction in both the radial and vertical
direction, resulting in a significant decrease in the scale-lengths and
scale-heights of thick disks. Kinematically, a growing thin disk can induce a
notable increase in the mean rotation and velocity dispersions of thick-disk
stars. We conclude that the reformation of a thin disk via gas accretion may
play a significant role in setting the structure and kinematics of thick disks,
and thus it is an important ingredient in models of thick-disk formation.

exactly-flat FLRW model is theoretically improbable. Here, in order to obtain a
probability space on the set F of compact, comoving, 3-spatial sections of FLRW
models, a physically motivated hypothesis is proposed, using the density
parameter Omega as a derived rather than fundamental parameter. We assume that
the processes that select the 3-manifold also select a global mass-energy and a
Hubble parameter. The inferred range in Omega consists of a single real value
for any 3-manifold. Thus, the obvious measure over F is the discrete measure.
Hence, if the global mass-energy and Hubble parameter are a function of
3-manifold choice among compact FLRW models, then probability spaces
parametrised by Omega do not, in general, give a zero probability of a flat
model. Alternatively, parametrisation by the injectivity radius r_inj (""size"")
suggests the Lebesgue measure. In this case, the probability space over the
injectivity radius implies that flat models occur almost surely (a.s.), in the
sense of probability theory, and non-flat models a.s. do not occur.

star, as shown in this study. Methods: Our dense photometric coverage of the
overall light curve and a proper microlensing modelling allow us to derive
measurements of the OGLE 2004-BLG-482 source star's linear limb-darkening
coefficients in three bands, including standard Johnson-Cousins I and R, as
well as in a broad clear filter. In particular, we discuss in detail the
problems of multi-band and multi-site modelling on the expected precision of
our results. We also obtained high-resolution UVES spectra as part of a ToO
programme at ESO VLT from which we derive the source star's precise fundamental
parameters. Results: From the high-resolution UVES spectra, we find that OGLE
2004-BLG-482's source star is a red giant of MK type a bit later than M3, with
Teff = 3667 +/- 150 K, log g = 2.1 +/- 1.0 and an assumed solar metallicity.

obtain from a detailed microlensing modelling of the light curve linear
limb-darkening coefficients that we compare to model-atmosphere predictions
available in the literature, and find a very good agreement for the I and R
bands. In addition, we perform a similar analysis using an alternative

irradiation of the close-in gas giant exoplanets -- the hot Jupiters. This
time-dependent surface heating gives rise to fluid motions which propagate
throughout the planet. We investigate the ability of this ""thermal tide"" to
produce a quadrupole moment which can couple to the stellar gravitational tidal
force. While previous investigations discussed planets with solid surfaces,
here we focus on entirely fluid planets in order to understand gas giants with
small cores. The Coriolis force, thermal diffusion and self-gravity of the
perturbations are ignored for simplicity. First, we examine the response to
thermal forcing through analytic solutions of the fluid equations which treat
the forcing frequency as a small parameter. In the ""equilibrium tide"" limit of
zero frequency, fluid motion is present but does not induce a quadrupole
moment. In the next approximation, finite frequency corrections to the
equilibrium tide do lead to a nonzero quadrupole moment, the sign of which
torques the planet {\it away} from synchronous spin. We then numerically solve
the boundary value problem for the thermally forced, linear response of a
planet with neutrally stratified interior and stably stratified envelope. The
numerical results find quadrupole moments in agreement with the analytic
non-resonant result at sufficiently long forcing period. Surprisingly, in the
range of forcing periods of 1-30 days, the induced quadrupole moments can be
far larger than the analytic result due to response of internal gravity waves
which propagate in the radiative envelope. We discuss the relevance of our
results for the spin, eccentricity and thermal evolution of hot Jupiters.

be low, unless this correlation is avoided in specific models. We explore such
a low-scale inflationary scenario in a racetrack model with a single modulus in
type IIB string theory. Inflation occurs near a point of inflection in the
K\""ahler modulus potential. Obtaining acceptable cosmological density
perturbations leads to the introduction of magnetized D7-branes sourcing

around 30 TeV, so that gravitinos that are produced in the inflaton decay do
not affect big-bang nucleosynthesis. Supersymmetry is communicated to the

decided mainly by anomaly contribution. This happens as a result of the low

solar LW spectra and density- and temperature-insensitive line intensity
ratios. The first step in this procedure is to use the coordinated, cospatial
EUNIS and SOHO/CDS spectra to carry out an intensity calibration update for the
CDS NIS-1 waveband, which shows that its efficiency has decreased by a factor
about 1.7 compared to that of the previously implemented calibration. Then,
theoretical insensitive line ratios obtained from CHIANTI allow us to determine
absolute intensities of emission lines within the EUNIS SW bandpass from those
of cospatial CDS/NIS-1 spectra after the EUNIS LW calibration correction. A
total of 12 ratios derived from intensities of 5 CDS and 12 SW emission lines
from Fe Fe X - Fe XIII yield an instrumental response curve for the EUNIS-06 SW
channel that matches well to a relative calibration which relied on combining
measurements of individual optical components. Taking into account all

equations in which the EM fields are chosen with astrophysically consistent
strengths. We consider binaries with spins aligned or anti-aligned with the
orbital angular momentum and study the dependence of gravitational and EM
signals with these spin configurations. Overall we find that the EM radiation
in the lowest l=2, m=2 multipole accurately reflects the gravitational one,
with identical phase evolutions and amplitudes that differ only by a scaling
factor. We also compute the efficiency of the energy emission in EM waves and
find that it is given by E^rad_EM/M ~ 10^-15 (M/10^8 M_Sun)^2 (B/10^4 G)^2,
hence 13 orders of magnitude smaller than the gravitational energy for
realistic magnetic fields. The corresponding luminosity is much smaller than
the accretion luminosity if the system is accreting at near the Eddington rate.
Most importantly, this EM emission is at frequencies of 10^-4 (10^8 M_Sun/M)
Hz, well outside those accessible to astronomical radio observations. As a
result, it is unlikely that the EM emission discussed here can be detected
directly and simultaneously with the gravitational-wave one. However, indirect
processes, driven by changes in the EM fields behavior could yield observable
events. In particular if the accretion rate of the circumbinary disc is small
and sufficiently stable over the timescale of the final inspiral, then the EM
emission may be observable indirectly as it will alter the accretion rate
through the magnetic torques exerted by the distorted magnetic field lines.

that flux level. We detect 141 synchrotron-dominated sources and 47
dust-dominated sources at S/N > 4.5 in at least one band. All of the most
significantly detected members of the synchrotron-dominated population are
associated with sources in previously published radio catalogs. Some of the
dust-dominated sources are associated with nearby (z << 1) galaxies whose dust
emission is also detected by the Infrared Astronomy Satellite (IRAS). However,
most of the bright, dust-dominated sources have no counterparts in any existing
catalogs. We argue that these sources represent the rarest and brightest
members of the population commonly referred to as sub-millimeter galaxies

typical SMG surveys, they are expected to have a higher mean redshift

from sky maps in the presence of noise and a source population in which number
counts are a steeply falling function of flux. The method is an extension of a
standard Bayesian procedure in the millimeter/submillimeter literature. As in
the standard method, the prior applied to source flux measurements is derived
from an estimate of the source counts as a function of flux, dN/dS. The key
feature of the new method is that it enables reliable extraction of properties
of individual sources, which previous methods in the literature do not. We
first present the method for extracting individual source fluxes from data in a
single observing band, then we extend the method to multiple bands, including
prior information about the spectral behavior of the source population(s). The
multi-band estimation technique is particularly relevant for classifying
individual sources into populations according to their spectral behavior. We
find that proper treatment of the correlated prior information between
observing bands is key to avoiding significant biases in estimations of
multi-band fluxes and spectral behavior, biases which lead to significant
numbers of misclassified sources. We test the single- and multi-band versions
of the method using simulated observations with observing parameters similar to
that of the South Pole Telescope data used in Vieira, et al. (2010).

lead to super-Eddington accretion during this secular phase if the rate is not
very far below Eddington prior to decoupling. Our model, though highly

in direct detection experiments, especially for dark matter models in which the
scattering is sensitive to the high velocity tail of the distribution, such as
inelastic dark matter (iDM) or light (few GeV) dark matter (LDM), and for
experiments that require high energy recoil events, such as many directionally
sensitive experiments. Here we determine the velocity distribution functions
from two of the highest resolution numerical simulations of Galactic dark

Maxwell-Boltzmann increase the contrast of the signal and change the typical
direction of incoming DM particles. For iDM, the expected signals at direct
detection experiments are changed dramatically: the annual modulation can be
enhanced by more than a factor two, and the relative rates of DAMA compared to
CDMS can change by an order of magnitude, while those compared to CRESST can
change by a factor of two. The spectrum of the signal can also change
dramatically, with many features arising due to substructure. For LDM the

presented for 12 967 sunspot umbrae detected on the NASA/NSO
spectromagnetograms between 1993 and 2004 to study umbral structure and
strength during the solar cycle. The umbrae are selected using an automated
thresholding technique. Measured umbral intensities are first corrected for a
confirming observation of umbral limb-darkening. Log-normal fits to the
observed size distribution confirm that the size spectrum shape does not vary
with time. The intensity-magnetic flux relationship is found to be steady over
the solar cycle. The dependence of umbral size on the magnetic flux and minimum
intensity are also independent of cycle phase and give linear and quadratic
relations, respectively. While the large sample size does show a low amplitude
oscillation in the mean minimum intensity and maximum magnetic flux correlated
with the solar cycle, this can be explained in terms of variations in the mean
umbral size. These size variations, however, are small and do not substantiate
a meaningful change in the size spectrum of the umbrae generated by the Sun.
Thus, in contrast to previous reports, the observations suggest the equilibrium
structure, as testified by the invariant size-magnetic field relationship, as
well as the mean size (i.e. strength) of sunspot umbrae do not significantly

  In the {\sc Subgraph Isomorphism} problem we are given two graphs $F$ and $G$
on $k$ and $n$ vertices respectively as an input, and the question is whether
there exists a subgraph of $G$ isomorphic to $F$. We show that if the treewidth
of $F$ is at most $t$, then there is a randomized algorithm for the {\sc
Subgraph Isomorphism} problem running in time $\cO^*(2^k n^{2t})$. To do so, we
associate a new multivariate {Homomorphism polynomial} of degree at most $k$
with the {\sc Subgraph Isomorphism} problem and construct an arithmetic circuit
of size at most $n^{\cO(t)}$ for this polynomial. Using this polynomial, we
also give a deterministic algorithm to count the number of homomorphisms from
$F$ to $G$ that takes $n^{\cO(t)}$ time and uses polynomial space. For the
counting version of the {\sc Subgraph Isomorphism} problem, where the objective
is to count the number of distinct subgraphs of $G$ that are isomorphic to $F$,
we give a deterministic algorithm running in time and space $\cO^*({n \choose

running in time $\cO^{*}(2^{k}{n \choose k/2}n^{5p})$ and taking space

(FeAs), has led to a resurgence of interest in superconductivity. Several
important traits of these materials are now apparent, for example, layers of
iron tetrahedrally coordinated by arsenic are crucial structural ingredients.
It is also now well established that the parent non-superconducting phases are
itinerant magnets, and that superconductivity can be induced by either chemical
substitution or application of pressure, in sharp contrast to the cuprate
family of materials. The structure and properties of chemically substituted
samples are known to be intimately linked, however, remarkably little is known
about this relationship when high pressure is used to induce superconductivity
in undoped compounds. Here we show that the key structural features in
BaFe2As2, namely suppression of the tetragonal to orthorhombic phase transition
and reduction in the As-Fe-As bond angle and Fe-Fe distance, show the same
behavior under pressure as found in chemically substituted samples. Using
experimentally derived structural data, we show that the electronic structure
evolves similarly in both cases. These results suggest that modification of the
Fermi surface by structural distortions is more important than charge doping
for inducing superconductivity in BaFe2As2.

possess a polymeric microstructure, we address here synchronization in a

we show that the presence of polymeric stresses removes the geometrical

from the receiver back to the transmitter. In cellular systems, the performance
of limited feedback will be degraded in the presence of other cell
interference, when the base stations have limited or no coordination. This
paper establishes the degradation in sum rate of users in a cellular system,
due to uncoordinated other cell interference and delay on the feedback channel.
A goodput metric is defined as the rate when the bits are successfully received
at the mobile station, and used to derive an upper bound on the performance of
limited feedback systems with delay. This paper shows that the goodput gained
from having delayed limited feedback decreases doubly exponentially as the
delay increases. The analysis is extended to precoded spatial multiplexing
systems where it is shown that the same upper bound can be used to evaluate the
decay in the achievable sum rate. To reduce the effects of interference, zero
forcing interference cancellation is applied at the receiver, where it is shown
that the effect of the interference on the achievable sum rate can be
suppressed by nulling out the interferer. Numerical results show that the decay
rate of the goodput decreases when the codebook quantization size increases and
when the doppler shift in the channel decreases.

million independent spectra, became possible with the installation of the
7-beam Arecibo L-Band Feed Array (ALFA) receiver in 2004. ALFA's 3.4 arcmin
resolution and tremendous sensitivity offer a great opportunity to observe the
fine details of HI in the Galaxy. The I-GALFA survey began in 2008 May and will
be completed in 2009 September. The data will be made publicly available when
the calibrated and gridded cubes are completed. Further information on the

succinct dynamic covering (SDC), arising in many modern-day web applications,
including ad-serving and online recommendation systems in eBay and Netflix.
Roughly speaking, SDC applies two restrictions to the well-studied Max-Coverage
problem: Given an integer k, X={1,2,...,n} and I={S_1, ..., S_m}, S_i a subset
of X, find a subset J of I, such that |J| <= k and the union of S in J is as
large as possible. The two restrictions applied by SDC are: (1) Dynamic: At
query-time, we are given a query Q, a subset of X, and our goal is to find J
such that the intersection of Q with the union of S in J is as large as
possible; (2) Space-constrained: We don't have enough space to store (and
process) the entire input; specifically, we have o(mn), and maybe as little as
O((m+n)polylog(mn)) space. The goal of SDC is to maintain a small data
structure so as to answer most dynamic queries with high accuracy. We call such
a scheme a Coverage Oracle.
  We present algorithms and complexity results for coverage oracles. We present
deterministic and probabilistic near-tight upper and lower bounds on the
approximation ratio of SDC as a function of the amount of space available to
the oracle. Our lower bound results show that to obtain constant-factor
approximations we need Omega(mn) space. Fortunately, our upper bounds present
an explicit tradeoff between space and approximation ratio, allowing us to
determine the amount of space needed to guarantee certain accuracy.

The Chandrasekhar formula is a well-known analytical estimation of the effect.
However, current astrophysicists have realized that the formula is not correct
in some cases because of several approximations dared in the formulation and/or
complex non-linearities in the real universe. For example, it has been
indicated that the dynamical friction doesn't work in cored density profiles
(constant density in the central region) despite that the Chandrasekhar formula
predicts drag force even in the constant densities. In the former half of this
paper, I discuss by N-body simulations that many-body interactions are also
important in actual dynamical friction though derivation of the Chandrasekhar
formula is based on the assumption of two-body interaction. In the simulation,
the many-body interactions are caused by a very small number of field particles
co-rotating with a perturber. However, the contribution from the many-body
interactions accounts for a non-negligible fraction of the actual dynamical
friction. In the latter half, I discuss why the cored profiles suppress the
dynamical friction. One possible explanation is that corrective effect of the
many-body interactions drive orbital motion of the perturber. The cessation of
dynamical friction by this corrective effect would be feasible even in shallow
cusp density profiles although the shallow cusp may evolve into a constant
density.

(MVAR) model, (b) the demixing is estimated jointly with the source MVAR
parameters, (c) overfitting is avoided by using the Group Lasso penalty. This
approach allows to extract the appropriate level cross-talk between the
extracted sources and in this manner we obtain a sparse data-driven model of
functional connectivity. We demonstrate the usefulness of SCSA with simulated
data, and compare to a number of existing algorithms with excellent results.

exhaustive, and is then amenable for inclusion in nature inspired algorithms

the incorporation of local entropy into the fitness function of the

well-known cluster synchronization schemes: self-organization and driving, by
whether the edges of communication paths lie at inter or intra-cluster. By this
way, we classify clusters according to whether the set of edges inter- or
intra-cluster edges are removable if wanting to keep the communication between
pairs of vertices in the same cluster. Also, we propose adaptive feedback
algorithms on the weights of the underlying graph, which can synchronize any
bi-directed networks satisfying the two conditions above. We also give several

behavior of the acceptor and donor doped samples. Hard materials exhibit a
steep increase of the complex permittivity with decreasing frequency. The onset

energy relaxation in two-phase flows. We begin our exposition by considering
the so-called six equations two-phase model [Ishii1975, Rovarch2006]. This
model assumes each phase to possess its own velocity and energy variables.
Despite recent advances, the six equations model remains computationally
expensive for many practical applications. Moreover, its advection operator may
be non-hyperbolic which poses additional theoretical difficulties to construct
robust numerical schemes |Ghidaglia et al, 2001]. In order to simplify this
system, we complete momentum and energy conservation equations by relaxation
terms. When relaxation characteristic time tends to zero, velocities and
energies are constrained to tend to common values for both phases. As a result,
we obtain a simple two-phase model which was recently proposed for simulation
of violent aerated flows [Dias et al, 2010]. The preservation of invariant
regions and incompressible limit of the simplified model are also discussed.
Finally, several numerical results are presented.

which has the remarkable property that the total mass can be written as a
conserved, positive definite, integral on the spacelike slices. The mass
integral provides a nonlinear control of the variables along the whole
evolution. In this gauge, Einstein equations reduce to a coupled
hyperbolic-elliptic system which is formally singular at the axis. As a first
step in analyzing this system of equations we study linear perturbations on
flat background. We prove that the linear equations reduce to a very simple
system of equations which provide, thought the mass formula, useful insight
into the structure of the full system. However, the singular behavior of the
coefficients at the axis makes the study of this linear system difficult from
the analytical point of view. In order to understand the behavior of the
solutions, we study the numerical evolution of them. We provide strong
numerical evidence that the system is well-posed and that its solutions have
the expected behavior. Finally, this linear system allows us to formulate a
model problem which is physically interesting by itself, since it is connected
with the linear stability of black holes solutions in axial symmetry. This
model can contribute significantly to solve the nonlinear problem and at the
same time it appears to be tractable.

different boundary conditions using this model; one set in the upper transition
region (the Radiative Energy Balance model), as well as a uniform chromospheric

observation synthesis from model results and the subsequent comparison to full

find that a relative simple empirical heating model is adequate in reproducing
