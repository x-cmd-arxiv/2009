line profiles in coadded spectra of 468 galaxies at 0.7 < z < 1.5. The galaxy
sample, drawn from the Team Keck Treasury Redshift Survey of the GOODS-N field,
has a range in stellar mass (M_*) comparable to that of the sample at z~1.4
analyzed in a similar manner by Weiner et al. (2009; W09), but extends to lower
redshifts and has specific star formation rates which are lower by ~0.6 dex. We
identify outflows of cool gas from the Doppler shift of the MgII absorption
lines and find that the equivalent width (EW) of absorption due to outflowing
gas increases on average with M_* and star formation rate (SFR). We attribute
the large EWs measured in spectra of the more massive, higher-SFR galaxies to
optically thick absorbing clouds having large velocity widths. The outflows
have hydrogen column densities N(H) > 10^19.3 cm^-2, and extend to velocities
of ~500 km/s. While galaxies with SFR > 10 Msun/yr host strong outflows in both
this and the W09 sample, we do not detect outflows in lower-SFR (i.e., log
M_*/Msun < 10.5) galaxies at lower redshifts. Using a simple galaxy evolution
model which assumes exponentially declining SFRs, we infer that strong outflows
persist in galaxies with log M_*/Msun > 10.5 as they age between z=1.4 and z~1,
presumably because of their high absolute SFRs. Finally, using high resolution
HST/ACS imaging in tandem with our spectral analysis, we find evidence for a
weak trend (at 1 sigma significance) of increasing outflow absorption strength
with increasing galaxy SFR surface density.

with depth; the proportionality approaches zero linearly as the upflow of gas

high rotation rates the torque exhibits quadratic rate- dependence and scales

probability distribution of a given random vector where each vertex represents
each of the different components of the random vector and where the absence of
an edge between any pair of variables implies marginal independence between
these two variables. Covariance graph models have recently received much
attention in the literature and constitute a sub-family of graphical models.
Though they are conceptually simple to understand, they are considerably more
difficult to analyze. Under some suitable assumption on the probability
distribution, covariance graph models can also be used to represent more
complex conditional independence relationships between subsets of variables.
When the covariance graph captures or reflects all the conditional independence
statements present in the probability distribution the latter is said to be
faithful to its covariance graph - though no such prior guarantee exists.
Despite the increasingly widespread use of these two types of graphical models,
to date no deep probabilistic analysis of this class of models, in terms of the
faithfulness assumption, is available. Such an analysis is crucial in
understanding the ability of the graph, a discrete object, to fully capture the
salient features of the probability distribution it aims to describe. In this
paper we demonstrate that multivariate Gaussian distributions that have trees
as covariance graphs are necessarily faithful. The method of proof is original
as it uses an entirely new approach and in the process yields a technique that
is novel to the field of graphical models.

expected to cause extensive genetic interactions or epistasis affecting the
heritability of complex traits and the distribution of genotypes in
populations. However, the inference of epistasis from the observed
phenotype-genotype correlation is impeded by statistical difficulties, while
the theoretical understanding of the effects of epistasis remains limited, in
turn limiting our ability to interpret data. Of particular interest is the
biologically relevant situation of numerous interacting genetic loci with small
individual contributions to fitness. Here, we present a computational model of
selection dynamics involving many epistatic loci in a recombining population.
We demonstrate that a large number of polymorphic interacting loci can, despite
frequent recombination, exhibit cooperative behavior that locks alleles into
favorable genotypes leading to a population consisting of a set of competing
clones. When the recombination rate exceeds a certain critical value that
depends on the strength of epistasis, this ""genotype selection"" regime
disappears in an abrupt transition, giving way to ""allele selection""-the regime
where different loci are only weakly correlated as expected in sexually
reproducing populations. We show that large populations attain highest fitness
at a recombination rate just below critical. Clustering of interacting sets of
genes on a chromosome leads to the emergence of an intermediate regime, where
blocks of cooperating alleles lock into genetic modules. These haplotype blocks
disappear in a second transition to pure allele selection. Our results
demonstrate that the collective effect of many weak epistatic interactions can
have dramatic effects on the population structure.

driven by the host immune response and by selective pressures exerted through
drug treatment. To understand and model the evolution of HIV quantitatively,
the parameters governing genetic diversification and the strength of selection
need to be known. While mutation rates can be measured in single replication
cycles, the relevant effective recombination rate depends on the probability of
coinfection of a cell with more than one virus and can only be inferred from
population data. However, most population genetic estimators for recombination
rates assume absence of selection and are hence of limited applicability to
HIV, since positive and purifying selection are important in HIV evolution.
Here, we estimate the rate of recombination and the distribution of selection
coefficients from time-resolved sequence data tracking the evolution of HIV
within single patients. By examining temporal changes in the genetic
composition of the population, we estimate the effective recombination to be
r=1.4e-5 recombinations per site and generation. Furthermore, we provide
evidence that selection coefficients of at least 15% of the observed
non-synonymous polymorphisms exceed 0.8% per generation. These results provide
a basis for a more detailed understanding of the evolution of HIV. A
particularly interesting case is evolution in response to drug treatment, where
recombination can facilitate the rapid acquisition of multiple resistance
mutations. With the methods developed here, more precise and more detailed
studies will be possible, as soon as data with higher time resolution and
greater sample sizes is available.

networks against behavioral properties expressed in temporal logic terms. Exact
probabilistic verification approaches such as, for example, CSL/PCTL model
checking, are undermined by a huge computational demand which rule them out for
most real case studies. Less demanding approaches, such as statistical model
checking, estimate the likelihood that a property is satisfied by sampling
executions out of the stochastic model. We propose a methodology for
efficiently estimating the likelihood that a LTL property P holds of a
stochastic model of a biochemical network. As with other statistical
verification techniques, the methodology we propose uses a stochastic
simulation algorithm for generating execution samples, however there are three
key aspects that improve the efficiency: first, the sample generation is driven
by on-the-fly verification of P which results in optimal overall simulation
time. Second, the confidence interval estimation for the probability of P to
hold is based on an efficient variant of the Wilson method which ensures a
faster convergence. Third, the whole methodology is designed according to a
parallel fashion and a prototype software tool has been implemented that
performs the sampling/verification process in parallel over an HPC
architecture.

(BMC) for shared memory environments as well as for clusters of workstations.
We present a generic framework for parallelized BMC named Tarmo. Our framework
can be used with any incremental SAT encoding for BMC but for the results in
this paper we use only the current state-of-the-art encoding for full PLTL.
Using this encoding allows us to check both safety and liveness properties,
contrary to an earlier work on distributing BMC that is limited to safety
properties only.
  Despite our focus on BMC after it has been translated to SAT, existing
distributed SAT solvers are not well suited for our application. This is
because solving a BMC problem is not solving a set of independent SAT instances
but rather involves solving multiple related SAT instances, encoded
incrementally, where the satisfiability of each instance corresponds to the
existence of a counterexample of a specific length. Our framework includes a
generic architecture for a shared clause database that allows easy clause
sharing between SAT solver threads solving various such instances.
  We present extensive experimental results obtained with multiple variants of
our Tarmo implementation. Our shared memory variants have a significantly
better performance than conventional single threaded approaches, which is a
result that many users can benefit from as multi-core and multi-processor
technology is widely available. Furthermore we demonstrate that our framework
can be deployed in a typical cluster of workstations, where several multi-core
machines are connected by a network.

attracting increasing attention from both the model checking community and the
real-time community. Explicit-time description methods verify real-time systems
using general model constructs found in standard un-timed model checkers.
Lamport proposed an explicit-time description method using a clock-ticking
process (Tick) to simulate the passage of time together with a group of global
variables to model time requirements. Two methods, the Sync-based Explicit-time
Description Method using rendezvous synchronization steps and the
Semaphore-based Explicit-time Description Method using only one global variable
were proposed; they both achieve better modularity than Lamport's method in
modeling the real-time systems. In contrast to timed automata based model
checkers like UPPAAL, explicit-time description methods can access and store
the current time instant for future calculations necessary for many real-time
systems, especially those with pre-emptive scheduling. However, the Tick
process in the above three methods increments the time by one unit in each
tick; the state spaces therefore grow relatively fast as the time parameters
increase, a problem when the system's time period is relatively long. In this
paper, we propose a more efficient method which enables the Tick process to
leap multiple time units in one tick. Preliminary experimental results in a
high performance computing environment show that this new method significantly
reduces the state space and improves both the time and memory efficiency.

deadlock states, from where the program has no outgoing transitions. Of these,
the former closely resembles with model checking and, hence, techniques for
efficient verification are directly applicable to it. Hence, we focus on
expediting the latter with the use of multi-core technology.
  We present two approaches for parallelization by considering different design
choices. The first approach is based on the computation of equivalence classes
of program transitions (called group computation) that are needed due to the
issue of distribution (i.e., inability of processes to atomically read and
write all program variables). We show that in most cases the speedup of this
approach is close to the ideal speedup and in some cases it is superlinear. The
second approach uses traditional technique of partitioning deadlock states
among multiple threads. However, our experiments show that the speedup for this
approach is small. Consequently, our analysis demonstrates that a simple
approach of parallelizing the group computation is likely to be the effective
method for using multi-core computing in the context of deadlock resolution.

in the centrifugal force makes it contract. This perturbs each fluid element,
raising the local pressure and originating deviations from beta equilibrium
that enhance the neutrino emissivity and produce thermal energy. This mechanism
is named rotochemical heating and has previously been studied for neutron stars
of nonsuperfluid matter, finding that they reach a quasi-steady configuration
in which the rate at which the spin-down modifies the equilibrium
concentrations is the same at which neutrino reactions restore the equilibrium.
Aims: We describe the thermal effects of Cooper pairing with spatially uniform
energy gaps of neutrons \Delta_n and protons \Delta_p on the rotochemical
heating in millisecond pulsars (MSPs) when only modified Urca reactions are
allowed. By this, we may determine the amplitude of the superfluid energy gaps
for the neutron and protons needed to produce different thermal evolution of
MSPs. Results: We find that the chemical imbalances in the star grow up to the
threshold value \Delta_{thr}= min(\Delta_n+ 3\Delta_p, 3\Delta_n+\Delta_p),
which is higher than the quasi-steady state achieved in absence of
superfluidity. Therefore, the superfluid MSPs will take longer to reach the
quasi-steady state than their nonsuperfluid counterparts, and they will have a
higher a luminosity in this state, given by L_\gamma ~ (1-4)
10^{32}\Delta_{thr}/MeV \dot{P}_{-20}/P_{ms}^3 erg s^-1. We can explain the UV
emission of the PSR J0437-4715 for 0.05 MeV<\Delta_{thr}<0.45 MeV.

and soft factors have extra scales to characterize the double log's. Using the
evolutions of the extra scales and the relation we can do the resummation of
the double log's perturbatively in sense that LCWF's are the only
nonpertubative objects in the resumed formula. Our results with some models of
LCWF show that there is a significant difference between numerical predictions
with or without the resummation.

not achieve speed up by using multiple geographical sites of a computational
grid. Because such operations are the building blocks of most scientific
applications, conventional supercomputers are still strongly predominant in
high-performance computing and the use of grids for speeding up large-scale
scientific problems is limited to applications exhibiting parallelism at a
higher level. We have identified two performance bottlenecks in the distributed
memory algorithms implemented in ScaLAPACK, a state-of-the-art dense linear
algebra library. First, because ScaLAPACK assumes a homogeneous communication
network, the implementations of ScaLAPACK algorithms lack locality in their
communication pattern. Second, the number of messages sent in the ScaLAPACK
algorithms is significantly greater than other algorithms that trade flops for
communication. In this paper, we present a new approach for computing a QR
factorization -- one of the main dense linear algebra kernels -- of tall and
skinny matrices in a grid computing environment that overcomes these two
bottlenecks. Our contribution is to articulate a recently proposed algorithm
(Communication Avoiding QR) with a topology-aware middleware (QCG-OMPI) in
order to confine intensive communications (ScaLAPACK calls) within the
different geographical sites. An experimental study conducted on the Grid'5000
platform shows that the resulting performance increases linearly with the
number of geographical sites on large-scale problems (and is in particular
consistently higher than ScaLAPACK's).

angular separation from a foreground galaxy ($z_{gal}$ = 0.03321) of 2.5"" (1.7

on-going star formation (0.004 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$) and a
metallicity of $-0.27 \pm 0.05$ dex. We detect 21cm absorption from the galaxy
with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), the Very Large Array (VLA), and the Very
Long Baseline Array (VLBA). The absorption appears to be quiescent disk gas
corotating with the galaxy and we do not find any evidence for outflowing cold
neutral gas. The width of the main absorption line indicates that the gas is
cold, $T_{k} < 283$ K, and the HI column is surprisingly low given the impact
parameter of 1.7 kpc; we find that N(HI) $\leq 9.6 \times 10^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$

resolves the continuum source and the absorber, and a lower limit of 27.1
$\times$ 13.9 pc is derived for the size of the absorbing cloud. In turn, this
indicates a low density for a cold cloud, n(HI) $<$ 3.5 cm$^{-3}$. We
hypothesize that this galaxy, which is relatively isolated, is becoming
depleted in HI because it is converting its interstellar matter into stars
without a replenishing source of gas, and we suggest future observations to
probe this and similar galaxies.

evolutionary events as site insertions and deletions (known as indels). Instead
tree building algorithms and ancestral state inference procedures typically
rely on substitution-only models of sequence evolution. In practice these
methods are extended beyond this simplified setting with the use of heuristics
that produce global alignments of the input sequences--an important problem
which has no rigorous model-based solution. In this paper we consider a new
version of the multiple sequence alignment in the context of stochastic indel
models. More precisely, we introduce the following {\em trace reconstruction
problem on a tree} (TRPT): a binary sequence is broadcast through a tree
channel where we allow substitutions, deletions, and insertions; we seek to
reconstruct the original sequence from the sequences received at the leaves of
the tree. We give a recursive procedure for this problem with strong
reconstruction guarantees at low mutation rates, providing also an alignment of
the sequences at the leaves of the tree. The TRPT problem without indels has
been studied in previous work (Mossel 2004, Daskalakis et al. 2006) as a
bootstrapping step towards obtaining optimal phylogenetic reconstruction

separation of ~4"". Together with the measurements from the Spitzer and MSX at
mid-IR, we determined the SED of W3-SE and fit it with a thermal dust emission

temperatures. The emission at mm/submm wavelengths is dominated by a major cold
(~41 K) with a mass of ~65 Msun. In addition, there is a weaker hot component
(~400 K) which accounts for emission in the mid-IR, suggesting that a small
fraction of dust has been heated by newly formed stars. We also imaged the
molecular core in the HCO+(1-0) line using CARMA at an angular resolution ~6"".
With the CARMA observations, we have verified the presence of a blue-dominated
double peak profile toward this core. The line profile cannot be explained by
infall alone. The broad velocity wings of the line profile suggest that other
kinematics such as outflows within the central 6"" of the core likely dominate
the resulting spectrum. The kinematics of the sub-structures of this core
suggest that the molecular gas outside the main component appears to be
dominated by the bipolar outflow originated from the dust core with a dynamical
age of >30000 yr. Our analysis, based on the observations at wavelengths from

bearing in mind the application to the collapsar models of gamma-ray bursts

perform a ray-tracing calculation in the framework of special relativity. The
numerical accuracy of the developed code is certificated by several tests, in
which we show comparisons with the corresponding analytical solutions. Using
hydrodynamical data in our collapsar simulation, we estimate the annihilation
rates in a post-processing manner. We show that the neutrino energy deposition
and momentum transfers are strongest near the inner edge of the accretion disk.
The beaming effects of special relativity are found to change the annihilation
rates by several factors in the polar funnel region. After the accretion disk
settles into a stationary state (typically later than
  $\sim 9$ s from the onset of gravitational collapse), we find that the
neutrino-heating timescale in the vicinity of the polar funnel ($\lesssim 80$
km) can become shorter than the hydrodynamical timescale, indicating that the
neutrino-heated outflows can be launched there. We point out that the momentum
transfer can play as important role as the energy deposition for the efficient
acceleration of neutrino-driven outflows.
  Our results suggest that the neutrino pair annihilation has a potential
importance equal to the conventional magnetohydrodynamic mechanism for igniting
the GRB fireballs.

cadence time shorter than the plasma cooling time, and the pulse energy is
below a certain threshold. A condensation does not produce observable
signatures in the global DEM structure. Conversely, the DEM coronal peak is
found sensitive to the pulse cadence time. Our simulations can also give an

polar angle $\theta$. Reflection rate becomes larger with increasing $\theta$,
and the $\theta$ dependence of adsorption rate is also found. The $\theta$

  We do not know any works that adopted the interference contributions for
inelastic processes. This is due to the generally adopted assumption that the
main contribution to the integrals expressing the cross section makes
multi-Regge domains with its characteristic strong ordering of secondary
particles by rapidity. However, in this work, we find what kind of space
domains makes a major contribution to the integral and these space domains are
not multi-Regge. We demonstrated that because these interference contributions
are significant, so they cannot be limited by a small part of them. With the
help of the approximate replacement the sum of a huge number of these
contributions by the integral were calculated partial cross sections for such
numbers of secondary particles for which direct calculation would be
impossible.
  The offered model qualitative agrees with experimental dependence of total
scattering cross-section on energy {\sqrt s} with a characteristic minimum in
the range {\sqrt s \approx 10} GeV.
  However, quantitative agreement was not achieved; we assume that due to the

the inner two planets may have evolved into an eccentricity fixed-point

102 research structures, 18,500 research products and 6,661 peer reviewers
(1,465 from abroad); it had a direct cost of 3.55 millions Euros and a time
length spanning over 18 months. The introduction of ratings based on ex post
quality of output and not on ex ante respect for parameters and compliance is
an important leap forward of the national research evaluation system toward
meritocracy. From the bibliometric perspective, the national assessment offered
the unprecedented opportunity to perform a large-scale comparison of peer
review and bibliometric indicators for an important share of the Italian
research production. The present investigation takes full advantage of this
opportunity to test whether peer review judgements and (article and journal)
bibliometric indicators are independent variables and, in the negative case, to
measure the sign and strength of the association. Outcomes allow us to advocate
the use of bibliometric evaluation, suitably integrated with expert review, for
the forthcoming national assessment exercises, with the goal of shifting from
the assessment of research excellence to the evaluation of average research
performance without significant increase of expenses.

motions of mechanical oscillators thereby realizing a linear quantum
opto-mechanical coupling. When performing a precise measurement of the position
of an oscillator, this coupling results in quantum radiation pressure noise. Up
to now this effect has not been observed yet. Generally speaking, the strength
of radiation pressure noise increases when the effective mass of the oscillator
is decreased or when the power of the reflected light is increased. Recently,
extremely light SiN membranes with high mechanical Q-values at room temperature
have attracted attention as low thermal noise mechanical oscillators. However,
the power reflectance of these membranes is much lower than unity which makes
the use of advanced interferometer recycling techniques to amplify the
radiation pressure noise in a standard Michelson interferometer inefficient.
Here, we propose and theoretically analyze a Michelson-Sagnac interferometer
that includes the membrane as a common end mirror for the Michelson
interferometer part. In this new topology, both, power- and signal-recycling
can be used even if the reflectance of the membrane is much lower than unity.
In particular, signal-recycling is a useful tool because it does not involve a
power increase at the membrane. We derive the formulas for the quantum
radiation pressure noise and the shot-noise of an oscillator position
measurement and compare them with theoretical models of the thermal noise of a
SiN membrane with a fundamental resonant frequency of 75 kHz and an effective
mass of 125 ng. We find that quantum radiation pressure noise should be
observable with a power of 1 W at the central beam splitter of the
interferometer and a membrane temperature of 1 K.

transformation. For a beam bender, since the three principal stretches at each
point induced by the spatial transformation are independent to each other,
there are many possibilities to simplify the transformed material parameters of
the bender by adjusting the stretches independently. With the DTO method, we
show that the reported reduced parameters of the bender obtained by equivalent
dispersion relation can be derived as a special case. An isotropic bender is
also proposed according to this method, and it is fabricated by stacking
dielectric materials in layered form. Experiments validate the function of the
designed isotropic bender for a TE wave; it is also shown that the isotropic
bender has a broadband with low loss, compared with the metamaterial bender.
The isotropic bender has much easier design and fabrication procedures than the

magneto-optical materials, this effect is very weak. One way to enhance it is
to incorporate the magnetic material into a high-Q optical resonator. One
problem with magneto-optical resonators is that along with Faraday rotation,
the absorption and linear birefringence can also increase dramatically,
compromising the device performance. Another problem is strong ellipticity of
the output light. We discuss how the above problems can be addressed in the
cases of optical microcavities and a slow wave resonators. We show that a slow
wave resonator has a fundamental advantage when it comes to Faraday rotation
enhancement in lossy magnetic materials.

  de l'Ecole Polytechnique, France",,,,"physics.plasm-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The goal of magnetic fusion research is to extract the power released by
fusion reactions and carried by the product of these reactions, liberated at
energies of the order of a few MeV. The feasibility of fusion energy production
relies on our ability to confine these energetic particles, while keeping the
thermonuclear plasma in safe operating conditions. For that purpose, it is
necessary to understand and find ways to control the interaction between
energetic particles and the thermonuclear plasma. Reaching these two goals is
the general motivation for the work conducted during the PhD. More
specifically, our focus is on one type of instability, the Beta Alfven
Eigenmode (BAE), which can be driven by energetic particles and impact on the
confinement of both energetic and thermal particles. In this work, we study the
characteristics of BAEs analytically and derive its dispersion relation and
structure. Next, we analyze the linear stability of the mode in the presence of
energetic particles. First, a purely linear description is used, which makes
possible to get an analytical linear criterion for BAE destabilization in the
presence of energetic particles. This criterion is compared with experiments
conducted in the Tore-Supra tokamak during the PhD. Secondly, because the
linear analysis reveals some features of the BAE stability which are subject to
a strong nonlinear modification, the question is raised of the possibility of a
sub-critical activity of the mode. We propose a simple scenario which makes
possible the existence of meta-stable modes, verified analytically and
numerically. Such a scenario is found to be relevant to the physics and scales
characterizing BAEs.

with Ulam's reconstruction conjecture, and then, more generally, the age
algebras of relational structures. This raises in return structural and
algorithmic problems in the invariant theory of permutation groups.
  In part two, the leitmotiv is the quest for simple yet rich combinatorial
models to describe algebraic structures and their representations. This
includes the Hecke group algebras of Coxeter groups which I introduced and
which relate to the affine Hecke algebras, but also some finite dimensional Kac
algebras in relation with inclusions of factors, and the rational Steenrod
algebras. Beside being concrete and constructive, such combinatorial models
shed light on certain algebraic phenomena and can lead to elegant and
elementary proofs.
  My favorite tool is computer exploration, and the algorithmic and effective
aspects play a major role in this manuscript. In particular, I describe the
international open source project *-Combinat which I founded back in 2000, and
whose mission is to provide an extensible toolbox for computer exploration in
algebraic combinatorics and to foster code sharing among researchers in this

formation prescription are used to study the minor merger process between a
giant galaxy (host) and a less massive spiral galaxy (satellite) with
reasonable assumptions for the ages and metallicities of the merger
progenitors. We find that the evolution of the star formation rate is extended
over several dynamical times and shows peaks which correspond to pericentre
passages of the satellite. The newly formed stars are mainly located in the
central part of the satellite remnant while the older stars of the initial disk
are deposited at larger radii in shell-like structures. After the final plunge
of the satellite, star formation in the central part of the remnant can
continue for several Gyrs depending on the star formation efficiency. Although
the mass fraction in new stars is small, we find that the half-mass radius
differs from the half-light radius in the V and H bands. Moreover synthetic 2D
images in J, H, NUV, Hb and V bands, using the characteristic filters of the
Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), reveal that
residual star formation induced by gas-rich minor mergers can be clearly
observed during and after the final plunge, especially in the NUV band, for
interacting systems at (z<0.023) over moderate numbers of orbits (~2 orbits
correspond to typical exposure times of ~3600 sec). This suggests that WFC3 has
the potential to resolve these substructures, characterize plausible past

active transmitters per unit area, given an outage constraint at each receiver
for a fixed rate of transmission. Assuming that the transmitter locations are
distributed as a Poisson point process, this paper derives upper and lower
bounds on the transmission capacity of an ad-hoc network when each node is
equipped with multiple antennas. The transmitter either uses eigen multi-mode
beamforming or a subset of its antennas to transmit multiple data streams,
while the receiver uses partial zero forcing to cancel certain interferers
using some of its spatial receive degrees of freedom (SRDOF). The receiver
either cancels the nearest interferers or those interferers that maximize the
post-cancelation signal-to-interference ratio. Using the obtained bounds, the
optimal number of data streams to transmit, and the optimal SRDOF to use for
interference cancelation are derived that provide the best scaling of the
transmission capacity with the number of antennas. With beamforming, single
data stream transmission together with using all but one SRDOF for interference
cancelation is optimal, while without beamforming, single data stream
transmission together with using a fraction of the total SRDOF for interference
cancelation is optimal.

  quantum mechanics",,,,"hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While Hermiticity of a time-independent Hamiltonian leads to unitary time
evolution, in and of itself, the requirement of Hermiticity is only sufficient
for unitary time evolution. In this paper we provide conditions that are both
necessary and sufficient. We show that $PT$ symmetry of a time-independent
Hamiltonian, or equivalently, reality of the secular equation that determines
its eigenvalues, is both necessary and sufficient for unitary time evolution.
For any $PT$-symmetric Hamiltonian $H$ there always exists an operator $V$ that
relates $H$ to its Hermitian adjoint according to $VHV^{-1}=H^{\dagger}$. When
the energy spectrum of $H$ is complete, Hilbert space norms $<\psi_1|V|\psi_2>$
constructed with this $V$ are always preserved in time. With the energy
eigenvalues of a real secular equation being either real or appearing in
complex conjugate pairs, we thus establish the unitarity of time evolution in
both cases. We also establish the unitarity of time evolution for Hamiltonians
whose energy spectra are not complete. We show that when the energy eigenvalues
of a Hamiltonian are real and complete the operator $V$ is a positive Hermitian
operator, which has an associated square root operator that can be used to
bring the Hamiltonian to a Hermitian form. We show that systems with
$PT$-symmetric Hamiltonians obey causality. We note that Hermitian theories are
ordinarily associated with a path integral quantization prescription in which
the path integral measure is real, while in contrast non-Hermitian but
$PT$-symmetric theories are ordinarily associated with path integrals in which
the measure needs to be complex, but in which the Euclidean time continuation
of the path integral is nonetheless real. We show that through $PT$ symmetry
the fourth-order derivative Pais-Uhlenbeck theory can be stabilized against
transitions to states negative frequency.

Amplitude (XVA) and Black Hole (BH) mass. The correlation for 21
reverberation-mapped Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) appears very tight, with an
intrinsic dispersion of 0.20 dex. The intrinsic dispersion of 0.27 dex can be
obtained if BH masses are estimated from the stellar velocity dispersions. We
further test the uncertainties of mass estimates from XVAs for objects which
have been observed multiple times with good enough data quality. The results
show that the XVAs derived from multiple observations change by a factor of 3.
This means that BH mass uncertainty from a single observation is slightly worse
than either reverberation-mapping or stellar velocity dispersion measurements;
however BH mass estimates with X-ray data only can be more accurate if the mean
XVA value from more observations is used. Applying this relation, the BH mass
of RE J1034+396 is found to be $4^{+3}_{-2} \times 10^6$ $M_{\odot}$. The high
end of the mass range follows the relationship between the 2$f_0$ frequencies
of high-frequency QPO and the BH masses derived from the Galactic X-ray
binaries. We also calculate the high-frequency constant $C= 2.37 M_\odot$
Hz$^{-1}$ from 21 reverberation-mapped AGN. As suggested by Gierli\'nski et
al., $M_{\rm BH}=C/C_{\rm M}$, where $C_{\rm M}$ is the high-frequency
variability derived from XVA. Given the similar shape of power-law dominated
X-ray spectra in ULXs and AGN, this can be applied to BH mass estimates of
ULXs. We discuss the observed QPO frequencies and BH mass estimates in the
Ultra-Luminous X-ray source M82 X-1 and NGC 5408 X-1 and favor ULXs as

scale-magnetic-field energy. Aims. The size distribution of MBPs is derived for
G-band images acquired by the Hinode/SOT instrument. Methods. For
identification purposes, a new automated segmentation and identification
algorithm was developed. Results. For a sampling of 0.108 arcsec/pixel, we
derived a mean diameter of (218 +- 48) km for the MBPs. For the full resolved
data set with a sampling of 0.054 arcsec/pixel, the size distribution shifted
to a mean diameter of (166 +- 31) km. The determined diameters are consistent
with earlier published values. The shift is most probably due to the different
spatial sampling. Conclusions. We conclude that the smallest magnetic elements

influence of discretisation effects (sampling) has also not yet been

three-dimensional shapes and the physical parameters of both dark matter (DM)
and intra-cluster medium (ICM) in a triaxial galaxy cluster. While most
previous studies rely on the standard spherical modeling, our approach allows
to infer the properties of the non-spherical intra-cluster gas distribution
sitting in hydrostatic equilibrium within triaxial DM halos by combining X-ray,
weak and strong lensing observations. We present an application of our method
to the galaxy cluster MACS J1423.8+2404. This source is an example of a well
relaxed object with a unimodal mass distribution and we infer shape and
physical properties of the ICM and the DM for this source. We found that this
is a triaxial galaxy cluster with DM halo axial ratios 1.53+/-0.15 and
1.44+/-0.07 on the plane of the sky and along the line of sight, respectively.
We show that accounting for the three-dimensional geometry allows to solve the
long-standing discrepancy between galaxy cluster masses determined from X-ray
and gravitational lensing observations. We focus also on the determination of
the inner slope of the DM density profile alpha, since the cuspiness of
dark-matter density profiles is one of the critical tests of the cold dark
matter (CDM) paradigm for structure formation: we measure alpha=0.94+/-0.09 by
accounting explicitly for the 3D structure for this cluster, a value which is
close to the CDM predictions, while the standard spherical modeling leads to
the biased value alpha=1.24+/-0.07. Our findings provide further evidences that

  transformation optics","10 pages, LaTex",,,,"physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Negative index of refraction has become an accepted part of transformation
optics, which is encountered in transformations that change the orientation of
the manifold. Based on this concept, various designs of perfect lenses have
been proposed, which all rely on a folding of space or spacetime, where the
maps from electromagnetic space to laboratory space are multi-valued. Recently,
a new concept for perfect imaging has been proposed by Leonhardt and Philbin,
which also uses multi-valued maps, but does neither include negative index of
refraction nor an amplification of evanescent modes. In this context it was
speculated that multi-valued maps should be seen as the basis of perfect
imaging rather than amplification of evanescent modes. It might be useful to
review the standard lens based on negative index of refraction from this point
of view. In this paper we show that a negative index of refraction is not an
inherent characteristic of transformation optics, but rather appears as a
specific choice of a sign ambiguity. Furthermore, we point out that the
transformation designed lens does not amplify evanescent modes, in contrast to
the Pendry-Veselago lens. Instead, evanescent modes at the image point are
produced by a duplicated source and thus no imaging of the near field takes
place.

chosen combination of lines. We use the automatic code ARES to measure the
equivalent width of several spectral lines, and use these to calibrate with the
precise effective temperature derived from spectroscopy presented in a previous

namely the class of languages that can be decided by a Turing machine in
polynomial time given access to an oracle with the power to compute a function
in the counting complexity class $#\mathbf{P}$. This result, which illustrates
the power of counting is considered to be a seminal result in computational
complexity theory. An analogous result (with a compactness hypothesis) in the
complexity theory over the reals (in the sense of Blum-Shub-Smale real machines
\cite{BSS89}) was proved in \cite{BZ09}. Unlike Toda's proof in the discrete
case, which relied on sophisticated combinatorial arguments, the proof in
\cite{BZ09} is topological in nature in which the properties of the topological
join is used in a fundamental way. However, the constructions used in
\cite{BZ09} were semi-algebraic -- they used real inequalities in an essential
way and as such do not extend to the complex case. In this paper, we extend the
techniques developed in \cite{BZ09} to the complex projective case. A key role
is played by the complex join of quasi-projective complex varieties. As a
consequence we obtain a complex analogue of Toda's theorem. The results
contained in this paper, taken together with those contained in \cite{BZ09},
illustrate the central role of the Poincar\'e polynomial in algorithmic
algebraic geometry, as well as, in computational complexity theory over the
complex and real numbers -- namely, the ability to compute it efficiently
enables one to decide in polynomial time all languages in the (compact)
polynomial hierarchy over the appropriate field.

associated with molecular gas and dust structures with radii of typically 0.5
pc, masses of ~5x10^3 Msun, column densities of ~5x10^{23} cm^{-2}, molecular
hydrogen densities of typically ~2x10^5 cm^{-3} and dust temperatures of ~40 K.
The 1.2 mm dust continuum observations further indicate that the cores are
centrally condensed, having radial density profiles with power-law indices in
the range 1.6-1.9. We find that under these conditions dynamical friction by
the gas plays an important role in the migration of high-mass stars towards the
central core region, providing an explanation for the observed stellar mass
segregation within the cores.

small-scale Hall instability conjectured to exist from the linear stability
analysis of Rheinhardt and Geppert. Identical linear stability analyses are
performed to find a suitable background field to model Rheinhardt and Geppert's
ideas. The nonlinear evolution of this field is then modelled using a
three-dimensional pseudospectral numerical MHD code. Combined with the
background field, energy was injected at the ten specific eigenmodes with the
greatest positive eigenvalues as inferred by the linear stability analysis.
Energy is transferred to different scales in the system, but not into small
scales to any extent that could be interpreted as a Hall instability. Any
instabilities are overwhelmed by a late-onset turbulent Hall cascade, initially
avoided by the choice of background field, but soon generated by nonlinear
interactions between the growing eigenmodes. The Hall cascade is shown here,
