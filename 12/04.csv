are now preferred over the Harrison-Zel'dovich model (n_s = 1, tensor-to-scalar

we derive constraints on the parameters (n_s, r) and compare our results with
the predictions of simple inflationary models. The marginalised credible
intervals read n_s = 0.962^{+0.028}_{-0.026} and r < 0.17 (at 95% confidence
level). Interestingly, the 68% c.l. contours favour mainly models with a convex
potential in the observable region, but the quadratic potential model remains
inside the 95% c.l. contours. We demonstrate that these results are robust to
changes in the datasets considered and in the theoretical assumptions made. We
then consider a non-vanishing running of the spectral indices by employing
different methods, non-parametric but approximate, or parametric but exact.
With our combination of CMB and LSS data, running models are preferred over
power-law models only by a Delta chi^2 ~ 5.8, allowing inflationary stages
producing a sizable negative running -0.063^{+0.061}_{-0.049} and larger
tensor-scalar ratio r < 0.33 at the 95% c.l. This requires large values of the
third derivative of the inflaton potential within the observable range. We
derive bounds on this derivative under the assumption that the inflaton
potential can be approximated as a third order polynomial within the observable

to their kinematic threshold. If these particles have strong enough attractive
interactions they may form bound states. Consequently, the bound states may
decay through annihilation back into the standard model. Such annihilation
decays have the potential to provide much information about the bound
particles, such as their mass, spin, or charges, in a manner completely
complementary to standard single particle cascade decays. Many of the
signatures, such as dijet resonances, will be challenging to find, but may be
extremely helpful in unraveling the nature of the new physics. In the standard
model, the only novel annihilation decays would be for toponium; these will be
hard to see because of the relatively large width of the top quark itself. In
models with supersymmetry, marginally visible annihilation decays may occur for
example, from bound states of gluinos to dijets or tops. If new particles are
bound through forces stronger than QCD, annihilation decays may even be the
discovery mode for new physics. This paper presents various theoretical results
about bound states and then addresses the practical question of whether any of
their annihilation decays can be seen at the LHC.

given as integrals over the moduli of connected, nodal curves in twistor space
whose degree and genus matches expectations from twistor-string theory. We
propose that a twistor-string theory for pure N=4 super Yang-Mills, if it
exists, is determined by the condition that these leading singularity formulae
arise as residues when an unphysical contour for the path integral is used, by
analogy with the momentum space leading singularity conjecture. We go on to
show that the genus g twistor-string moduli space for g-loop N^{k-2}MHV

singularity, the image of this map is a 2(n-2)-dimensional subcycle of G(k,n)
of exactly the type found from the Grassmannian residue formula of
Arkani-Hamed, Cachazo, Cheung and Kaplan. Based on this correspondence and the
Grassmannian conjecture, we deduce restrictions on the possible leading
singularities of multi-loop N^pMHV amplitudes. In particular, we argue that no
new leading singularities can arise beyond 3p loops.

the effect of a clumpy interstellar medium. We show that this scenario fits
reasonably well both the UV luminosity functions and the UV-continuum slopes

younger than 25 Myr from the gas clouds where they should be embedded at their

Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes on the Euclidean lattice. The simulations are
performed in quenched SU(2) QCD with the plaquette gauge action at $\beta =
2.45$ and the Wilson quark action. We concentrate on S-wave scattering states
of two scalar diquarks. Evaluating different flavor combinations with various
quark masses, we try to find out the ingredients in hadronic interactions.
Between two scalar diquarks ($u C\gamma_5 d$, the lightest baryon in SU(2)
system), we observe repulsion in short-range region, even though present quark
masses are not very light. We define and evaluate the ""quark-exchange part"" in
the interaction, which is induced by adding quark-exchange diagrams, or
equivalently, by introducing Pauli blocking among some of quarks. The repulsive
force in short-distance region arises only from the ""quark-exchange part"", and
disappears when quark-exchange diagrams are omitted. We find that the strength
of repulsion grows in light quark-mass regime and its quark-mass dependence is
similar to or slightly stronger than that of the color-magnetic interaction by
one-gluon-exchange (OGE) processes. It is qualitatively consistent with the
constituent-quark model picture that a color-magnetic interaction among quarks
is the origin of repulsion. We also find a universal long-range attractive
force, which enters in any flavor channels of two scalar diquarks and whose
interaction range and strength are quark-mass independent. The weak quark-mass
dependence of interaction ranges in each component implies that meson-exchange
contributions are small and subdominant, and the other contributions, {\it ex.}
flavor exchange processes, color-Coulomb or color-magnetic interactions, are
considered to be predominant, in the quark-mass range we evaluated.

parameter suggested elsewhere to be a marker for origin in that high values of

symmetric piece-wise meromorphic functions invariant with respect to a
symmetric Schottky group. The solution to this problem is derived in terms of
two analogues of the Cauchy kernel, quasiautomorphic and quasimultiplicative
kernels. The former kernel is known for any symmetry Schottky group. We prove
the existence theorem for the second, quasimultiplicative, kernel for any
Schottky group (its series representation is known for the first class groups
only). We also show that the use of an automorphic kernel requires the solution
to the associated real analogue of the Jacobi inversion problem which can be
bypassed if we employ the quasiautomorphic and quasimultiplicative kernels. We
apply this theory to a model steady-state problem on the motion of charged

which galaxies exhibit a clear bimodality.
  We find that the early-type fraction, f_ET, rises with cosmic time, with a
corresponding decrease in the late-type fraction, f_LT, in both luminosity- and
mass-selected samples. However, the evolution of the comoving number density is
very different: the decrease in the total number density of M_B <= -20 galaxies
since z = 1 is due to the decrease in the late-type population, which accounts
for ~75% of the total star-formation rate in the range under study, while the
increase in the total number density of M_star >= 10^10 M_Sun galaxies in the
same redshift range is due to the evolution of early types. This suggests that
we need a structural transformation between late-type galaxies that form stars
actively and early-type galaxies in which the stellar mass is located.

GOODS-S, we infer that only ~20% of the new early-type galaxies with M_star >=

suggesting that minor mergers and secular processes may be the driving
mechanisms of the structural evolution of intermediate-mass (M_star ~ 4x10^10

derive analytical solutions, taking into account the major neutral-neutral
reactions for gases at T>100 K. The chemical network is dominated by
photodissociation and neutral-neutral reactions. Despite the high gas
temperature, deuterium fractionation occurs because of the difference in
activation energy between deuteration enrichment and the back reactions. The
analytical solutions were confirmed by the time-dependent chemical results in a
1E-3 MSun disc around a typical TTauri star using the photochemical code
ProDiMo. The ProDiMo code includes frequency-dependent 2D dust-continuum
radiative transfer, detailed non-LTE gas heating and cooling, and hydrostatic

predict high [HDO]/[H2O] ratios in the terrestrial planet forming region (< 3

unique criterion to discriminate between the different origins of water on

broken power law with a break at L* = 10^52.5{+-0.2}[erg/sec] and with indices
alpha = 0.2^{+0.2-0.1} and beta = 1.4^{+0.3-0.6}. The recently detected GRB
090423, with redshift ~8, fits nicely into the model's prediction, verifying
that we are allowed to extend our results to high redshifts. While there is a
possible agreement with the star formation rate (SFR) for z<3, the high
redshift slope is shallower than the steep decline in the SFR for 4<z. However
we cannot rule out a GRB rate that follows one of the recent SFR models.

tidal stresses near the saddle points of the Newtonian gravitational potential.
An analytical examination of the saddle between two bodies revealed a linear
and a non-linear solution, valid for the outer and inner regions. Here we
present a numerical algorithm for solving the MOND equations. We check the code
against the two-body analytical solutions and explore the region transitioning
between them. We then develop a a realistic model for the MONDian effects on
the saddles of the Sun-Earth-Moon system (including further sources is
straightforward). For the Sun-Earth saddle we find that the two-body results
are almost unchanged, with corrections increasing from full to new Moon. In
contrast, the Moon saddle is an intrinsically three-body problem, but we
numerically find a recipe for adapting the two-body solution to this case, by
means of a suitable re-scaling and axis re-orientation. We explore possible
experimental scenarios for LISA Pathfinder, and the prospect of a visit to the
saddle(s) at the end of the mission. Given the chaotic nature of the orbits,
awareness of the full range of the possibilities is crucial for a realistic
prediction. We conclude that even with very conservative assumptions on the
impact parameter, the accelerometers are abundantly sensitive to vindicate or
rule out the theory.

from critical points. This implies that the likelihoods of spatial steady state
profiles of physical observables are nonlocal functionals. In this letter, it
is shown that these properties are essential to a successful analysis of a
functional level inverse problem, in which a macroscopic non-equilibrium
fluctuation field is estimated from limited but spatially scattered
information. To exemplify this, we dilute an out-of-equilibrium fluid flowing
through random media with a marker, which can be observed in an experiment. We
see that the hidden variables describing the random environment result in
spatial long-range correlations in the marker signal. Two types of statistical
estimators for the structure of the underlying media are then constructed: a
linear estimator provides unbiased and asymptotically precise information on
the particle density profiles, but yields negative estimates for the effective
resistances of the media in some cases. A nonlinear, maximum likelihood
estimator, on the other hand, results in a faithful media structure, but has a
small bias. These two approaches complement each other. Finally, estimation of
non-equilibrium fluctuation fields evolving in time is discussed.

After the unsupervised pre-training, neurons arise that form approximate

really discovers structure in these data. Pre-training can be done on a
completely different dataset (we use Corel dataset) and we find that the
supervised phase performs just as good (on the 15 Scenes dataset). This leads
us to conjecture that one can pre-train the system once (e.g. in a factory) and
subsequently apply it to many supervised problems which then learn much faster.
The best performance is obtained with single hidden layer system suggesting
that the histogram of sift features doesn't have much high level structure. The
overall performance is almost equal, but slightly worse then that of the

new capabilities to study the structural components of galaxies and other
astronomical objects in digital images. Our technique improves on previous 2-D
fitting algorithms by allowing for irregular, curved, logarithmic and power-law
spirals, ring and truncated shapes in otherwise traditional parametric
functions like the Sersic, Moffat, King, Ferrer, etc., profiles. One can mix
and match these new shape features freely, with or without constraints, apply
them to an arbitrary number of model components and of numerous profile types,
so as to produce realistic-looking galaxy model images. Yet, despite the
potential for extreme complexity, the meaning of the key parameters like the
Sersic index, effective radius or luminosity remain intuitive and essentially
unchanged. The new features have an interesting potential for use to quantify
the degree of asymmetry of galaxies, to quantify low surface brightness tidal
features beneath and beyond luminous galaxies, to allow more realistic
decompositions of galaxy subcomponents in the presence of strong rings and
spiral arms, and to enable ways to gauge the uncertainties when decomposing
galaxy subcomponents. We illustrate these new features by way of several case
studies that display various levels of complexity.

sulfur features, which are a signature of carbon/oxygen burning, have always

at redshift z=0.143. Using HST public images in two different filters, the
presence of two background sources lensed into an Einstein ring and a double
system is ascertained. Our new spectroscopic observations, performed at the
NOT, reveal that the two sources are located at the same redshift z=0.531. We
investigate the total mass distribution of the lens between 1 and 4 kpc from
the galaxy center by means of parametric and non-parametric lensing codes that
describe the multiple images as point-like objects. Several disparate lensing
models agree on: (1) reproducing accurately the observed image positions; (2)
predicting a nearly axisymmetric total mass distribution, centered and oriented
as the light distribution; (3) measuring a value of 8.11 x 10^{10} M_{Sun} for
the total mass projected within the Einstein radius of 2.5 kpc; (4) estimating
a total mass density profile slightly steeper than an isothermal one. A fit of
the SDSS multicolor photometry with CSP models provides a value of 20 x 10^{10}
M_{Sun} for the total stellar mass of the galaxy and of 0.9 for the fraction of
projected luminous over total mass enclosed inside the Einstein radius. By
combining lensing and photometric mass measurements, we differentiate the lens
mass content in terms of luminous and dark matter components. This
two-component modeling, which is viable only in extraordinary systems like SDSS
J1538+5817, leads to a description of the global properties of the galaxy dark
matter halo. Extending these results to a larger number of lenses would improve
considerably our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution processes in

out that due to a phenomenon similar to Anderson localization, exponentially

values of Q have coupled statistical states, a larger entropy metric, and a
maximum coupled-entropy distribution of compact-support coupled-Gaussians.
Negative values of Q have decoupled statistical states and for -2 < Q < 0 a
maximum coupled-entropy distribution of heavy-tail coupled-Gaussians. The
conjugate transformation between the heavy-tail and compact-support domains is
shown to be -2Q/(2+Q) for coupled-Gaussian distributions. This conjugate
relationship has been used to extend the generalized Fourier transform to the
compact-support domain and to define a scale-invariant correlation structure
with heavy-tail limit distribution. In the present paper, we show that the
conjugate is a mapping between the source of nonlinearity in non-stationary
stochastic processes and the nonlinear coupling which defines the
coupled-Gaussian limit distribution. The effects of additive and multiplicative
noise are shown to be separable into the coupled-variance and the coupling
parameter Q, providing further evidence of the importance of the generalized

quadrature noise spectrum of the field after propagating through the medium in
the case where the field has a general (but small) noise spectrum and the atoms
are in a coherent population trapping state and show electromagnetically
induced transparency (EIT). Although the mean values of the field remain
unaltered as the field propagates, there is an oscillatory interchange of noise
properties between the probe and pump fields. Also, as the field propagates,
there is an oscillatory creation and annihilation of correlations between the
probe and pump quadratures. We further study the field propagation of squeezed
states when there is two-photon resonance, but the field has a detuning
$\delta$ from atomic resonance. We show that the field propagation is very
sensitive to $\delta$. The propagation in this case can be explained as a
combination of a frequency dependent rotation of maximum squeezed quadrature
with an interchange of noise properties between pump and probe fields. It is

out with the Arecibo Observatory (AO) and the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope
(GMRT), respectively. Both stars exhibit two stable emission modes. We report
the discovery in B0943+10 of a highly linearly polarized precursor component
that occurs primarily in only one mode. This emission feature closely resembles
B1822-09's precursor which also occurs brightly in only one mode. B0943+10's
other mode is well known for its highly regular drifting subpulses that are
apparently produced by a rotating carousel system of 20 beamlets. Similary,
B1822-09 exhibits subpulse-modulation behavior only in the mode where its
precursor is absent. We survey our 18 hours of B0943+10 observations and find
that the sideband-modulation features, from which the carousel-rotation time
can be directly determined, occur rarely--less than 5% of the time--but always
indicating 20 beamlets. We present an analysis of B1822-09's modal modulation
characteristics at 325-MHz and compare them in detail with B0943+10. The pulsar
never seems to null, and we find a 43-rotation-period feature in the star's Q
mode that modulates the interpulse as well as the conal features in the main
pulse. We conclude that B1822-09 must have a nearly orthogonal geometry and
that its carousel circulation time is long compared to the modal sub-sequences
available in our observations, and the mainpulse/interpulse separation is
almost exactly 180 degrees. We conclude the precursors for both stars are
incompatible with core-cone emission. We assess the interesting suggestion by
Dyks et al. that downward-going radiation produces B1822-09's precursor

envelopes of low-metallicity asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. We have
evolved models of 1, 1.5 and 2 solar masses from the pre-main sequence to the
end of the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch with thermohaline mixing
applied throughout the simulations. In agreement with other authors, we find
that thermohaline mixing substantially reduces the abundance of helium-3 on the
upper part of the red giant branch in our lowest mass model. However, the small
amount of helium-3 that remains is enough to drive thermohaline mixing on the
AGB. We find that thermohaline mixing is most efficient in the early thermal
pulses and its efficiency drops from pulse to pulse. Nitrogen is not
substantially affected by the process, but we do see substantial changes in
carbon-13. The carbon-12 to carbon-13 ratio is substantially lowered during the
early thermal pulses but the efficacy of the process is seen to diminish
rapidly. As the process stops after a few pulses, the carbon-12 to carbon-13
ratio is still able to reach values of 10^3-10^4, which is inconsistent with
the values measured in carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars. We also note a
surprising increase in the lithium-7 abundance, with log epsilon(Li-7) reaching
values of over 2.5 in the 1.5 solar mass model. It is thus possible to get
stars which are both C- and Li-rich at the same time. We compare our models to
measurements of carbon and lithium in carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars which
have not yet reached the giant branch. These models can simultaneously
reproduced the observed C and Li abundances of carbon-enhanced metal-poor
turn-off stars that are Li-rich, but the observed nitrogen abundances still
cannot be matched.

green modulation [1], in a proactive Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) over
Rayleigh flat-fading channels with path-loss. We describe the proactive system
model according to a pre-determined time-based process utilized in practical
sensor nodes. The present analysis is based on realistic parameters including
the effect of channel bandwidth used in the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, and the
active mode duration. A comprehensive analysis, supported by some simulation
studies on the probability mass function of the LT code rate and coding gain,
shows that among uncoded NC-MFSK and various classical channel coding schemes,
the optimized LT coded NC-MFSK is the most energy-efficient scheme for distance
$d$ greater than the pre-determined threshold level $d_T$, where the
optimization is performed over coding and modulation parameters. In addition,
although uncoded NC-MFSK outperforms coded schemes for $d < d_T$, the energy
gap between LT coded and uncoded NC-MFSK is negligible for $d < d_T$ compared
to the other coded schemes. These results come from the flexibility of the LT
code to adjust its rate to suit instantaneous channel conditions, and suggest
that LT codes are beneficial in practical low-power WSNs with dynamic position
sensor nodes.

method to train a strong binary classifier constructed as a thresholded sum
over weak classifiers. Our motivation was to cast the training of a classifier
into a format amenable to solution by the quantum adiabatic algorithm. Applying
adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) promises to yield solutions that are superior
to those which can be achieved with classical heuristic solvers. Interestingly
we found that by using heuristic solvers to obtain approximate solutions we
could already gain an advantage over the standard method AdaBoost. In this
communication we generalize the baseline method to large scale classifier
training. By large scale we mean that either the cardinality of the dictionary
of candidate weak classifiers or the number of weak learners used in the strong
classifier exceed the number of variables that can be handled effectively in a
single global optimization. For such situations we propose an iterative and
piecewise approach in which a subset of weak classifiers is selected in each
iteration via global optimization. The strong classifier is then constructed by
concatenating the subsets of weak classifiers. We show in numerical studies
that the generalized method again successfully competes with AdaBoost. We also
provide theoretical arguments as to why the proposed optimization method, which
does not only minimize the empirical loss but also adds L0-norm regularization,
is superior to versions of boosting that only minimize the empirical loss. By
conducting a Quantum Monte Carlo simulation we gather evidence that the quantum
adiabatic algorithm is able to handle a generic training problem efficiently.

test brane when crossing the trapped brane. The slowing down effect is either
due to a parametric resonance when the interaction time is small compared to
the Hubble time or a tachyonic resonance when the interaction time is large. In
both cases the motion of the inflationary brane after the interaction is
governed by a chameleonic potential,which tends to slow it down. We find that a

When quantum effects are significant, the future shows all the signs of quantum

of time, after the time-irreversible process of state-vector reduction has
taken place, the past emerges, with the previous quantum uncertainty replaced
by the classical certainty of definite particle identities and states. The
present time is where this transition largely takes place, but the process does
not take place uniformly: Evidence from delayed choice and related experiments
shows that isolated patches of quantum indeterminacy remain, and that their
transition from probability to certainty only takes place later. Thus, when
quantum effects are significant, the picture of a classical Evolving Block
Universe (`EBU') cedes place to one of a Crystallizing Block Universe (`CBU'),
which reflects this quantum transition from indeterminacy to certainty, while
nevertheless resembling the EBU on large enough scales.

reconstruction using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy
(STS). The orientation of the graphene lattice changes from one island to the
other. In the STM images, this rotational disorder gives rise to various
superlattices with periods in the nm range. We show that those superlattices
are moir\'e patterns (MPs) and we correlate their apparent height with the
stacking at the graphene/SiC(3x3) interface. The contrast of the MP in STM
images corresponds to a small topographic modulation of the graphene layer.
  From STS measurements we find that the substrate surface presents a 1,5 eV
wide bandgap encompassing the Fermi level. This substrate surface bandgap
subsists below the graphene plane. The tunneling spectra are spatially
homogeneous on the islands within the substrate surface gap, which shows that
the MPs do not impact the low energy electronic structure of graphene. We
conclude that the SiC(3 x 3) reconstruction efficiently passivates the
substrate surface and that the properties of the graphene layer which grows on
top of it should be similar to those of the ideal material.

diffusivity, the heat that is carried by the vertical vortices spreads out in

meaning and averages on all the items of a given list. Decisions about the
number of items in the input lists for language comparison have been debated
since the beginning of glottochronology. The point is that words associated to
some of the meanings have a rapid lexical evolution. Therefore, a large
vocabulary comparison is only apparently more accurate then a smaller one since
many of the words do not carry any useful information. In principle, one should
find the optimal length of the input lists studying the stability of the
different items. In this paper we tackle the problem with an automated
methodology only based on our normalized Levenshtein distance. With this
approach, the program of an automated reconstruction of languages relationships
is completed.

This method is based on the difference in magnitude between the main sequence
turn-off (MSTO) and a well defined knee located along the lower main sequence
(MSK). This feature is caused by the collisionally induced absorption of
molecular hydrogen and it can be easily identified in near-infrared (NIR) and
in optical-NIR color-magnitude diagrams of stellar systems. We took advantage
of deep and accurate NIR images collected with the Multi-Conjugate Adaptive
Optics Demonstrator temporarily available on the Very Large Telescope and of
optical images collected with the Advanced Camera for Surveys Wide Field Camera
on the Hubble Space Telescope and with ground-based telescopes to estimate the
absolute age of the globular NGC3201 using both the MSTO and the
Delta(MSTO-MSK). We have adopted a new set of cluster isochrones and we found
that the absolute ages based on the two methods agree to within one sigma.
However, the errors of the ages based on the Delta(MSTO-MSK) method are
potentially more than a factor of two smaller, since they are not affected by
uncertainties in cluster distance or reddening.Current isochrones appear to
predict slightly bluer (~0.05mag) NIR and optical-NIR colors than observed for
magnitudes fainter than the MSK.

star formation rate tracers at different wavelengths is required. The
calibration has to consistently take into account the effects of extinction,
star formation regime (short or long-lived) and evolutionary state to avoid
biases at different redshift ranges. We use evolutionary synthesis models
optimized for intense episodes of star formation in order to compute a
consistent calibration of the most usual star formation rate tracers at
different energy ranges, from X-ray to radio luminosities. Nearly-instantaneous
and continuous star formation regimes, and the effect of interstellar
extinction are considered, as well as the effect of metallicity on the
calibration of the different estimators. A consistent calibration of a complete

interstellar extinction and initial mass function. We discuss the validity of
the different tracers in different star formation scenarios and compare our
predictions with previous calibrations of general use. Nearly-instantaneous and
continuous star formation regimes must be distinguished. While the Star
Formation Strength (\msun) should be used for the former, the more common Star
Formation Rate (\msun yr$^{-1}$) is only valid for episodes forming stars at a
constant rate during extended periods for time. Moreover, even for the latter,
the evolutionary state should be taken into account, since most SFR tracers
stabilize only after 100 Myr of evolution.

progenitor star the external pressure support may drop and the jet may enter
the regime of ballistic expansion during which its magnetic acceleration
becomes highly ineffective. However, recent numerical simulations suggested
that the transition to this regime is accompanied by a sudden ""burst"" of
acceleration. We confirm this finding and attribute the acceleration to the
sideways expansion of the jet - the magnetic energy is converted into the
kinetic one in the strong magnetosonic rarefaction wave, which is launched when
the jet loses its external support. This type of acceleration, the rarefaction
acceleration, is specific to relativistic jets because their energy budget can
still be dominated by magnetic energy even in highly super-fast magnetosonic
regime. Just like the collimation acceleration of externally confined
magnetized jets, it is connected with the geometry of magnetic flux sufaces. In
both cases, in the acceleration zone the poloidal field lines diverge faster
than in the monopolar configuration. On the other hand, whereas the collimation
acceleration keeps the product of jet opening angle and Lorentz factor somewhat
below unity, the rarefaction acceleration allows to make it significantly
larger, in agreement with the standard model of jet breaks in afterglow light
curves.

of several nearby, young, dust depleted ""transitional"" disks. Our observations
target five of the six clearest cases of transitional disks in the
Taurus/Auriga star-forming region (DM Tau, GM Aur, LkCa 15, UX Tau A, and RY
Tau) to explore the possibility that the depletion of optically thick dust from
the inner disks is caused by stellar companions rather than the more typical
planet-formation hypothesis. At the 99.7% confidence level, the observed
visibilities exclude binaries with flux ratios of at least 0.05 and separations
ranging from 2.5 to 30 mas (0.35 - 4 AU) over >= 94% of the area covered by our
measurements. All targets but DM Tau show near-infrared excess in their SED
higher than our companion flux ratio detection limits. While a companion has
previously been detected in the candidate transitional disk system CoKu Tau/4,
we can exclude similar mass companions as the typical origin for the clearing
of inner dust in transitional disks and of the near-infrared excess emission.
Unlike CoKu Tau/4, all our targets show some evidence of accretion. We find
that all but one of the targets are clearly spatially resolved, and UX Tau A is
marginally resolved. Our data is consistent with hot material on small scales
(0.1 AU) inside of and separated from the cooler outer disk, consistent with
the recent SED modeling. These observations support the notion that some
transitional disks have radial gaps in their optically thick material, which
could be an indication for planet formation in the habitable zone (~ a few AU)
of a protoplanetary disk.

a simple but accurate approximation for the random close packing density of

show a general (but weak) dependence of the final (essentially hard sphere)

eliminated by choosing a specific relation between mass and particle size,

past each other in a cylindrical tube has a continuum of possibilities due to
the arbitrariness of the interface between the fluids. By invoking the presence
of surface tension to at least restrict the shape of any interface to that of a
circular arc or full circle, we consider the following question: which flow
will maximise the exchange when there is only one dividing interface Gamma?
Surprisingly, the answer differs fundamentally from the better-known
co-directional two-phase flow situation where an axisymmetric (concentric)
core-annular solution always optimises the flux. Instead, the maximal flux
state is invariably asymmetric either being a `side-by-side' configuration
where Gamma starts and finishes at the tube wall or an eccentric core-annular
flow where Gamma is an off-centre full circle in which the more viscous fluid
is surrounded by the less viscous fluid. The side-by-side solution is the most
efficient exchanger for a small viscosity ratio beta less than or equal to 4.60
with an eccentric core-annular solution optimal otherwise. At large beta, this
eccentric solution provides 51% more flux than the axisymmetric core-annular
flow which is always a local minimiser of the flux.

results suggest that the fraction of the linking number absorbed as twist and
writhe is nontrivially dependent on chain length and excess linking number.
Beyond the supercoiling transition, chains of the order of one persistence
length carry equal amounts of twist and writhe. For longer chains, an
increasing fraction of the linking number is absorbed by the writhe.

functional on the set of all probability measures, qualitative robustness is
proven by showing that this functional is continuous with respect to the
topology generated by weak convergence of probability measures. Combined with
the existence and uniqueness of support vector machines, our results show that
support vector machines are the solutions of a well-posed mathematical problem

composition is obtained. We reveal the dependence of the steady-state
composition on the solubility laws of the bubble components. Besides, the
universal, independent from the solubility laws, expressions for the

supersymmetry at the LHC will go a long way towards establishing the nature of
dark matter. I present arguments why mainly axion cold dark matter is a better
fit for supersymmetric models than neutralinos. I also argue that
Yukawa-unified SUSY GUT theories based on SO(10) with mixed axion/axino cold
dark matter are extremely compelling, and present distinctive signatures for
gluino pair production at the LHC.

the work of the French explorer Dumont D'Urville \cite{Urv}. He collected
comparative words lists of various languages during his voyages aboard the
Astrolabe from 1826 to 1829 and, in his work about the geographical division of
the Pacific, he proposed a method to measure the degree of relation among
languages. The method used by modern glottochronology, developed by Morris
Swadesh in the 1950s, measures distances from the percentage of shared
cognates, which are words with a common historical origin. Recently, we
proposed a new automated method which uses normalized Levenshtein distance
among words with the same meaning and averages on the words contained in a
list. Recently another group of scholars \cite{Bak, Hol} proposed a refined of
our definition including a second normalization. In this paper we compare the
information content of our definition with the refined version in order to
decide which of the two can be applied with greater success to resolve
relationships among languages.
