cascading gravity brane-world model, and use this to study cosmological
solutions. We obtain this effective action through the 6D decoupling limit, in
which an additional scalar degree mode, \pi, called the brane-bending mode,
determines the bulk-brane gravitational interaction. The 5D action obtained
this way inherits from the sixth dimension an extra \pi self-interaction
kinetic term. We compute appropriate boundary terms, to supplement the 5D
action, and hence derive fully covariant junction conditions and the 5D
Einstein field equations. Using these, we derive the cosmological evolution
induced on a 3-brane moving in a static bulk. We study the strong- and
weak-coupling regimes analytically in this static ansatz, and perform a
complete numerical analysis of our solution. Although the cascading model can
generate an accelerating solution in which the \pi field comes to dominate at
late times, the presence of a critical singularity prevents the \pi field from
dominating entirely. Our results open up the interesting possibility that a
more general treatment of degravitation in a time-dependent bulk, or taking
into account finite brane-thickness effects, may lead to an accelerating
universe without a cosmological constant.

partially fill up the gap by calculating the difference of the rates of the two
non-leptonic weak processes in four transverse spin-one color superconducting
phases of quark matter (slightly) out of $\beta$-equilibrium. The four phases
studied are the color-spin locked phase, the polar phase, the planar phase and
the {\em A}-phase. In the limit of vanishing color superconducting gap, we
reproduce the known results in the normal phase. In the general case, the rates
are suppressed relative to the normal phase. The degree of the suppression is
determined by the structure of the gap function in momentum space, which in
turn is determined by the pairing pattern of quarks. At low temperatures, the
rate is dominated by the ungapped modes. In this limit, the strongest
suppression of the rate occurs in the color-spin-locked phase, and the weakest

deteriorating since its launch in 2002 because of radiation damage caused by
passing through the Earth's radiation belts. To restore its former sensitivity,
the spectrometer underwent an annealing procedure in November 2007. It,
however, changed the RHESSI response and affected gamma-ray burst measurements,
e.g., the hardness ratios and the spectral capabilities bellow approximately
100 keV.

of data mining concepts are used in the educational field for the purpose of
extracting useful information on the behaviors of students in the learning
process. In this EDM, feature selection is to be made for the generation of
subset of candidate variables. As the feature selection influences the
predictive accuracy of any performance model, it is essential to study
elaborately the effectiveness of student performance model in connection with
feature selection techniques. In this connection, the present study is devoted
not only to investigate the most relevant subset features with minimum
cardinality for achieving high predictive performance by adopting various
filtered feature selection techniques in data mining but also to evaluate the
goodness of subsets with different cardinalities and the quality of six
filtered feature selection algorithms in terms of F-measure value and Receiver
Operating Characteristics (ROC) value, generated by the NaiveBayes algorithm as
base-line classifier method. The comparative study carried out by us on six
filter feature section algorithms reveals the best method, as well as optimal
dimensionality of the feature subset. Benchmarking of filter feature selection
method is subsequently carried out by deploying different classifier models.
The result of the present study effectively supports the well known fact of
increase in the predictive accuracy with the existence of minimum number of
features. The expected outcomes show a reduction in computational time and
constructional cost in both training and classification phases of the student
performance model.

also introduce a way to treat the divergence relation of the magnetic field

to a spectral index between 1.55 and 2.05. The extrapolated magnetic field

dark matter abundance are environmentally selected in a multiverse. An
underlying supersymmetric theory containing the states of the MSSM and
singlets, with supersymmetry and R symmetry broken at unified scales, has just
two realistic low energy effective theories. One theory, (SM + \tilde{w}), is
the Standard Model augmented only by the wino, having a mass near 3 TeV, and
has a Higgs boson mass in the range of (127 - 142) GeV. The other theory, (SM +
\tilde{h}/\tilde{s}), has Higgsinos and a singlino added to the Standard Model.
The Higgs boson mass depends on the single new Yukawa coupling of the theory,
y, and is near 141 GeV for small y but grows to be as large as 210 GeV as this
new coupling approaches strong coupling at high energies. Much of the parameter
space of this theory will be probed by direct detection searches for dark
matter that push two orders of magnitude below the present bounds; furthermore,
the dark matter mass and cross section on nucleons are correlated with the
Higgs boson mass. The indirect detection signal of monochromatic photons from
the galactic center is computed, and the range of parameters that may be
accessible to LHC searches for trilepton events is explored. Taking a broader
view, allowing the possibility of R symmetry protection to the TeV scale or
axion dark matter, we find four more theories: (SM + axion), two versions of
Split Supersymmetry, and the E-MSSM, where a little supersymmetric hierarchy is
predicted. The special Higgs mass value of (141 \pm 2) GeV appears in symmetry
limits of three of the six theories, (SM + axion), (SM + \tilde{w}) and (SM +

Lyutikov (2007) of GP emission, we are carrying out a campaign of simultaneous
observations of the Crab pulsar between gamma-rays (Fermi) and radio
wavelengths. The correlation between times of arrival of radio GPs and
high-energy photons, whether it exists or not, will allow us to choose between
different origins of GP emission and further constrain the emission physics.
Our foremost goal was testing whether radio GPs are due to changes in the
coherence of the radio emission mechanism, variations in the pair creation rate
in the pulsar magnetosphere, or changes in the beaming direction. Accomplishing
this goal requires an enormous number of simultaneous radio GPs and
gamma-photons. Thus, we organized a radio observations campaign using the 42-ft
telescope at the Jodrell Bank Observatory (UK), the 140-ft telescope, and the
100-m Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) at the Green Bank Observatory
(WV). While the observations with the two first ones are ongoing, here we
present the preliminary results of 20 hrs of observations with the GBT at the
high frequency of 8.9 GHz. These particular observations were aimed to probe
the model of GP emission by Lyutikov (2007) which predicts that GPs at
frequencies > 4 GHz should be accompanied by gamma-ray photons of energies of
1-100 GeV.

reduce the stiffness of the actuator. A position sensor measures the
deflection, and the force output is accurately calculated using Hooke's Law

transmission time and error. The progressive transmission is based on the
process that the input image is decomposed into many subblocks each to be
coded, compressed, and transmitted individually. Therefore, firstly the image
is segmented into a number of subblocks and then the discrete wavelet transform
decomposes each subblock into different time-frequency components. Finally the
components are coded for error control and transmitted. The complete system is
coded in VHDL. In the proposed system, we choose a 3-level Haar wavelet
transform to perform the wavelet transform for each subblock. It is simple,

error of MMNF in weak EMG signal with very high noise, 0 dB SNR, is about 5-10

the setup of multi-antenna wireless networks. The concept of Random Sequential
(RS) relaying is previously introduced in the literature and showed that it
achieves the maximum diversity gain in a general multi-antenna network. Here,
we show that random unitary matrix multiplication at the relay nodes empowers
the RS scheme to achieve a better Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff (DMT) as
compared to the traditional AF relaying. First, we study the case of a
multi-antenna full-duplex single-relay two-hop network, for which we show that
the RS achieves the optimum DMT. Applying this result, we derive a new
achievable DMT for the case of multi-antenna half-duplex parallel relay
network. Interestingly, it turns out that the DMT of the RS scheme is optimum
for the case of multi-antenna two parallel non-interfering half-duplex relays.
Next, we show that random unitary matrix multiplication also improves the DMT
of the Non-Orthogonal AF relaying scheme in the case of a multi-antenna single
relay channel. Finally, we study the general case of multi-antenna full-duplex
relay networks and derive a new lower-bound on its DMT using the RS scheme.

problem in a background independent manner we first rewrite the worldsheet
theory in a language where it describes a single particle moving in an
infinite-dimensional curved spacetime. This language is developed at a formal
level without regularizing the infinite-dimensional traces. Then we adopt
DeWitt's (Phys.Rev.85:653-661,1952) coordinate independent formulation of
quantum mechanics in the present context. Given the expressions for the
classical Virasoro generators, this procedure enables us to define the
coordinate invariant quantum analogues which we call DeWitt-Virasoro
generators. This framework also enables us to calculate the invariant matrix
elements of an arbitrary operator constructed out of the DeWitt-Virasoro
generators between two arbitrary scalar states. Using these tools we further
calculate the DeWitt-Virasoro algebra in spin-zero representation. The result
is given by the Witt algebra with additional anomalous terms that vanish for
Ricci-flat backgrounds. Further analysis need to be performed in order to
precisely relate this with the beta function computation of Friedan and others.

conformal invariance for certain pp-wave that has been recently discussed using

extensively studied over the years, culminating with Lagrangian and Hamiltonian
descriptions of fluid dynamics where the configuration space is defined as the
volume-preserving diffeomorphisms, and Kelvin's circulation theorem is viewed
as a consequence of Noether's theorem associated with the particle relabeling
symmetry of fluid mechanics. However computational approaches to fluid
mechanics have been largely derived from a numerical-analytic point of view,
and are rarely designed with structure preservation in mind, and often suffer
from spurious numerical artifacts such as energy and circulation drift. In
contrast, this paper geometrically derives discrete equations of motion for
fluid dynamics from first principles in a purely Eulerian form. Our approach
approximates the group of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms using a finite
dimensional Lie group, and associated discrete Euler equations are derived from
a variational principle with non-holonomic constraints. The resulting discrete
equations of motion yield a structure-preserving time integrator with good
long-term energy behavior and for which an exact discrete Kelvin's circulation
theorem holds.

for the decreasing time interval between the observed peaks in the visual light

particular, much attention has been drawn by states containing N photons in a
superposition of all being in one of two designated modes. These maximally path
entangled states, known as 'NOON' states, exhibit enhanced phase sensitivity
and allow reaching the fundamental quantum limit of precision measurement. Such
states could also be used for obtaining 'super-resolution' in quantum
lithography. Creation of NOON states in the lab, has been limited to N=3.
Surpassing this has proven a formidable experimental challenge. Here, we
realize a scheme for generation of high fidelity NOON states with arbitrarily
large N. We demonstrate the versatility of the scheme by measuring up to N=5 in
a single setup, this is in contrast to previous experiments which were
custom-designed for a specific N. The scheme is based on high order
interference between 'quantum' down-converted light and 'classical' coherent
light in the photon number basis. Our results verify the high degree of path

that may be realized through convenient manipulation of Bose-Einstein
condensates. The procedure is based on the modulation of breathers through an
analytical study of the one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which is
known to offer a good theoretical model to describe quasi-one-dimensional
cigar-shaped condensates. Using a specific Ansatz, we transform the
nonautonomous nonlinear equation into an autonomous one, which engenders
composed states corresponding to solutions localized in space, with an
oscillating behavior in time. Numerical simulations confirm stability of the
breathers against random perturbation on the input profile of the solutions.

density. We use a non-supersymmetric gravity dual to a confining guage theory
which exhibits a running dilaton. The interaction of mesons with the finite
density medium is encoded in the dual theory by a force balancing between
flavor D7-branes and a baryon vertex provided by a wrapped D5-brane. When the
current quark mass m_q is sufficiently large, the meson mass reduces,
exhibiting an interesting spectral flow as we increase the baryon density while
it has a more complicated behaviour for very small m_q.

circular arcs structure of the correlated electron momentum spectra reveals a
resonant double ionization process in which the two electrons transit from
doubly excited states into continuum states by simultaneously absorbing and
sharing excess energy in integer units of the photon energy. Coulomb repulsion
between the two electrons in continuum states is responsible for the dominant
back-to-back electron emission and two intensity-independent cutoffs in the
two-electron energy spectra.

cluster states with photons. This approach involves unitary transformations
performed on atoms coupled to optical cavities. Its operation cost scales
linearly with the number of qubits in the cluster state, and photon qubits are
encoded such that single-qubit operations can be easily implemented by using
linear optics. Robust optical one-way quantum computation can be performed
since cluster states can be stored in atoms and then transferred to photons
that can be easily operated and measured. Therefore, this proposal could help
performing robust large-scale optical one-way quantum computation.

resonances in $(4,1)$-branes constructed with one scalar field coupled with
gravity in deformed models. Such models give solutions for the scalar field
that is the usual kink solution in the extra dimension for a parameter $p=1$
and deformations with a two-kink profile for odd $p>1$. Gravity is localized
and resonant modes are found for small values of $p$. The coupling between the
scalar field and spinors is a necessary condition for fermions to be localized
on such branes. After performing a chiral decomposition of the five-dimensional
spinor we found resonances with both chiralities for all odd $p$'s. The
correspondence between the spectra for left and right chirality is guaranteed
and Dirac fermions are realized on the brane. The increasing of $p$
characterizes the formation of branes with internal structure that turns the
gravitational interaction more effective for fermions aside the brane,
increasing their lifetime. The influence of the internal structure of the
branes and the presence of resonances for gravity and fermionic modes is
addressed.

structures, due to Nielsen, Plotkin and Winskel, is extended to arbitrary nets
without self-loops, under the collective token interpretation. To this end we
propose a more general form of event structure, matching the expressive power
of such nets. These new event structures and nets are connected by relating
both notions with configuration structures, which can be regarded as
representations of either event structures or nets that capture their behaviour
in terms of action occurrences and the causal relationships between them, but
abstract from any auxiliary structure.
  A configuration structure can also be considered logically, as a class of
propositional models, or - equivalently - as a propositional theory in
disjunctive normal from. Converting this theory to conjunctive normal form is
the key idea in the translation of such a structure into a net.
  For a variety of classes of event structures we characterise the associated
classes of configuration structures in terms of their closure properties, as
well as in terms of the axiomatisability of the associated propositional
theories by formulae of simple prescribed forms, and in terms of structural
properties of the associated Petri nets.
