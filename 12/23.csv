is usually associated with that configuration's stability against small
perturbations, and with the sub-luminality of these. Here, we exhibit an
effective field theory that allows for stable NEC-violating solutions with
exactly luminal excitations only. The model is the recently introduced
`galileon', or more precisely its conformally invariant version. We show that
the theory's low-energy S-matrix obeys standard positivity as implied by
dispersion relations. However we also show that if the relevant NEC-violating
solution is inside the effective theory, then other (generic) solutions allow
for superluminal signal propagation. While the usual association between
sub-luminality and positivity is not obeyed by our example, that between NEC
and sub-luminality is, albeit in a less direct way than usual.

remarkable accuracy, be scaled to represent the growth of large-scale structure
in a cosmology with parameters similar to but different from those originally
assumed. Our algorithm involves three steps: a reassignment of length, mass and
velocity units, a relabelling of the time axis, and a rescaling of the
amplitudes of individual large-scale fluctuation modes. We test it using two
matched pairs of simulations. Within each pair, one simulation assumes
parameters consistent with analyses of the first-year WMAP data. The other has
lower matter and baryon densities and a 15% lower fluctuation amplitude,
consistent with analyses of the three-year WMAP data. The pairs differ by a
factor of a thousand in mass resolution, enabling performance tests on both
linear and nonlinear scales. Our scaling reproduces the mass power spectra of
the target cosmology to better than 0.5% on large scales (k < 0.1 h/Mpc) both
in real and in redshift space. In particular, the BAO features of the original
cosmology are removed and are correctly replaced by those of the target
cosmology. Errors are still below 3% for k < 1 h/Mpc. Power spectra of the dark
halo distribution are even more precisely reproduced, with errors below 1% on
all scales tested. A halo-by-halo comparison shows that centre-of-mass
positions and velocities are reproduced to better than 90 kpc/h and 5%,
respectively. Halo masses, concentrations and spins are also reproduced at
about the 10% level, although with small biases. Halo assembly histories are
accurately reproduced, leading to central galaxy magnitudes with errors of
about 0.25 magnitudes and a bias of about 0.13 magnitudes for a representative
semi-analytic model.

the first 100 sq. deg. field observed by the South Pole Telescope (SPT) at 150
and 220 GHz. On angular scales where the primary CMB anisotropy is dominant,
ell ~< 3000, the SPT power spectrum is consistent with the standard LambdaCDM
cosmology. On smaller scales, we see strong evidence for a point source
contribution, consistent with a population of dusty, star-forming galaxies.
After we mask bright point sources, anisotropy power on angular scales of 3000
< ell < 9500 is detected with a signal-to-noise > 50 at both frequencies. We
combine the 150 and 220 GHz data to remove the majority of the point source
power, and use the point source subtracted spectrum to detect
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) power at 2.6 sigma. At ell=3000, the SZ power in the
subtracted bandpowers is 4.2 +/- 1.5 uK^2, which is significantly lower than
the power predicted by a fiducial model using WMAP5 cosmological parameters.
This discrepancy may suggest that contemporary galaxy cluster models
overestimate the thermal pressure of intracluster gas. Alternatively, this
result can be interpreted as evidence for lower values of sigma8. When combined
with an estimate of the kinetic SZ contribution, the measured SZ amplitude
shifts sigma8 from the primary CMB anisotropy derived constraint of 0.794 +/-
0.028 down to 0.773 +/- 0.025. The uncertainty in the constraint on sigma8 from
this analysis is dominated by uncertainties in the theoretical modeling
required to predict the amplitude of the SZ power spectrum for a given set of
cosmological parameters.

(QIAWs) is studied in a quantum electron-ion plasma. By using a 2D quantum
hydrodynamic model and the method of multiple scales, a new set of coupled
nonlinear partial differential equations is derived which governs the slow
modulation of the 2D QIAW packets. The oblique modulational instability (MI) is
then studied by means of a corresponding nonlinear Schroedinger equation
derived from the coupled nonlinear partial differential equations. It is shown
that the quantum parameter H (proportional to $\hbar$), associated with the
Bohm potential, shifts the MI domains around the $k\theta$-plane, where $k$ is
the carrier wave number and $\theta$ is the angle of modulation. In particular,
the ion-acoustic wave (IAW), previously known to be stable under parallel
modulation in classical plasmas, is shown to be unstable in quantum plasmas.
The growth rate of the MI is found to be quenched by the obliqueness of
modulation. The modulation of 2D QIAW packets along $\mathbf{k}$ is shown to be
described by a set of Davey-Stewartson-like equations. The latter can be
studied for the 2D wave collapse in dense plasmas. The predicted results, which
could be important to look for stable wave propagation in laboratory
experiments as well as in dense astrophysical plasmas, thus generalize the
theory of MI of IAW propagations both in classical and quantum electron-ion
plasmas.

others from just looking. Traditionally, the designers of big telescopes
invariably did not predict what the telescopes would ultimately be known for.

unexpected new phenomena, new theories, and new ideas which will emerge from
these discoveries. It is important that those who are in a position to filter

investigations which explore new areas without having predefined the result
they are looking for. Progress must also allow for new discoveries, as well as

other layer is highly ionised and does not show any correlation with the flux
of the source. The spectra can also be interpreted assuming reflection by an
ionised accretion disk seen behind a warm absorber. The warm absorber
ionisation is consistent with being correlated with the flux of the source,
which provides an additional degree of self-consistency with the overall
reflection-based model. We explain the spectral variability with light bending
according to the models of Miniutti and Fabian and constrain the black hole
spin to be a/M > 0.86. Both scenarios also assume that a distant cold reflector
is responsible for the Fe K \alpha emission line.
  Light bending provides an attractive explanation of the different states of
PG 2112+059 and may also describe the physical cause of the observed properties
of other X-ray weak quasars.

determined by a combination of direct phase diffusion and the effect of
amplitude fluctuations which affect the phase because the resonator frequency

similar theory for symmetric signatures, analytic diagrams (a notion introduced

coalescent process, which models ancestry of gene copies within populations, is
often used to model the probability distribution of gene trees given a fixed
species tree. This multispecies coalescent model provides a framework for
phylogeneticists to infer species trees from gene trees using maximum
likelihood or Bayesian approaches. Because the coalescent models a branching
process over time, all trees are typically assumed to be rooted in this

methods are unrooted.
  We investigate probabilities of unrooted gene trees under the multispecies

reveal the structures are isotropic and have short-range order on length scales
comparable to optical wavelengths. We performed angle-resolved reflection and
scattering spectrometry to fully characterize the colors under directional and
omni-directional illumination of white light. Under directional lighting, the
colors change with the angle between the directions of illumination and
observation. The angular dispersion of the primary peaks in the
scattering/reflection spectra can be well explained by constructive
interference of light that is scattered only once in the quasi-ordered
structures. Using the Fourier power spectra of structure from the SAXS data we
calculated optical scattering spectra and explained why light scattering peak
is the highest in the backscattering direction. Under omni-directional
lighting, colors from the quasi-ordered structures are invariant with the
viewing angle. The non-iridescent coloration results from isotropic nature of
structures instead of strong backscattering. By comparing the data to those of
an periodic structure, we demonstrated the difference in structural coloration
between the quasi-ordered structures and ordered structures.

different degrees of smoothing. Data-driven choice of localization degree in
this case can be understood as the problem of selection from this family. This
task can be performed by a suggested in Katkovnik and Spokoiny (2008) FLL
technique based on Lepski's method. An important issue with this type of
procedures - the choice of certain tuning parameters - was addressed in
Spokoiny and Vial (2009). The authors called their approach to the parameter
calibration ""propagation"". In the present paper the propagation approach is
developed and justified for the heteroscedastic case in presence of the noise
misspecification. Our analysis shows that the adaptive procedure allows a
misspecification of the covariance matrix with a relative error of order
1/log(n), where n is the sample size.

explain the tests performed to ensure its accuracy, and discuss how the central

There is a huge quantity of normal modes with very different frequencies and a
complex structure of the associated magnetic pressure perturbation and velocity
field. The modes can be classified as bottom, middle, and top according to
their frequencies and spatial structure. Second, the temporal evolution of the
velocity and magnetic pressure perturbation after an initial disturbance are
analyzed. We find complex motions of the strands. The frequency analysis
reveals that these motions are a combination of low and high frequency modes.
The complexity of the strand motions produces a strong modulation of the whole

influences its transverse oscillations and so its transverse dynamics cannot be
properly described by those of an equivalent monolithic loop.

one-dimensional systems. For two body collisions excitations of transverse
modes are the prerequisite for energy exchange and thermalzation. At very low
temperatures excitations of transverse modes are exponentially suppressed,
thermalization by two body collisions stops and the system should become
integrable. In quantum mechanics virtual excitations of higher radial modes are
possible. These virtually excited radial modes give rise to effective
three-body velocity-changing collisions which lead to thermalization. We show
that these three-body elastic interactions are suppressed by pairwise quantum
correlations when approaching the strongly correlated regime. If the relative
momentum $k$ is small compared to the two-body coupling constant $c$ the
three-particle scattering state is suppressed by a factor of $(k/c)^{12}$,
which is proportional to $\gamma ^{12}$, that is to the square of the
three-body correlation function at zero distance in the limit of the
Lieb-Liniger parameter $\gamma \gg 1$. This demonstrates that in one
dimensional quantum systems it is not the freeze-out of two body collisions but
the strong quantum correlations which ensures absence of thermalization on

-> 2 process, namely g+g -> J/psi+g as expected from LO pQCD. We have shown
that the rapidity distribution of the nuclear modification factor R_dAu, and
particularly its anti-shadowing peak, is systematically shifted toward larger
rapidities in the 2 -> 2 kinematics, irrespective of which shadowing
parametrisation is used. In turn, we have noted differences in the effective
final-state nuclear absorption necessary to fit the PHENIX d+Au data. Taking
advantage of our implementation of a 2 -> 2 kinematics, we have also computed
the transverse momentum dependence of the latter nuclear modification factor,
which cannot be predicted with the usual simplified kinematics. All the
corresponding observables have been computed for Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions and
compared to the PHENIX and STAR data. Finally, we have extracted the effective
nuclear absorption from the recent measurements of R_CP in d+Au by the PHENIX
collaboration.

of this paper is providing a simple and universal method to constraint dark

functions contain all the astrophysical inputs such as the electron propagation
in the galaxy, the dark matter profile, the gamma-ray fluxes of known origin,

matter decay models that can well fit the positron and electron fluxes observed
by PAMELA and Fermi LAT. To this end we also take into account prompt radiation
from the dark matter decay. We find that with the available data decaying dark

explained in terms of quantum confinement of phonons in silicon nanostructures

luminescence at $\sim$ 1.9 eV at room temperature, which confirms the presence
of silicon nanostructures. Raman studies on P$^+$ implanted samples were also
done as a function of ion energy. The Raman results show an amorphous top SOS

force fields employed for the ions. To resolve the fine differences between
ions of the same valence and roughly similar size and in particular to
correctly describe ion-specific effects, it is clear that accurate force fields
are necessary. In the past, optimization strategies for ionic force fields
either considered single-ion properties (such as the solvation free energy at
infinite dilution or the ion-water structure) or ion-pair properties (in the
form of ion-ion distribution functions). In this paper we investigate
strategies to optimize ionic force fields based on single-ion and ion-pair
properties simultaneously. To that end, we simulate five different salt
solutions, namely CsCl, KCl, NaI, KF, and CsI, at finite ion concentration. The
force fields of these ions are systematically varied under the constraint that
the single-ion solvation free energy matches the experimental value, which
reduces the two-dimensional $\{\sigma,\epsilon\}$ parameter space of the
Lennard Jones interaction to a one dimensional line for each ion. From the
finite-concentration simulations, the pair-potential is extracted and the
osmotic coefficient is calculated, which is compared to experimental data. We
find a strong dependence of the osmotic coefficient on the force field, which
is remarkable as the single-ion solvation free energy and the ion-water
structure remain invariant under the parameter variation. Optimization of the
force field is achieved for the cations Cs$^+$ and K$^+$, while for the anions
I$^-$ and F$^-$ the experimental osmotic coefficient cannot be reached. This
suggests that in the long run, additional parameters might have to be
introduced into the modeling, for example by modified mixing rules.

extended over a linear size of ~20,000AU flattened in the direction
perpendicular to the outflow. This N2H+ feature coincides with the outer
envelope seen in the 8 micron extinction by Looney et al. Meanwhile, the dust
continuum traces the compact, nearly spherical structure of the inner envelope,
where N2H+ becomes depleted. This highly flattened N2H+ envelope also shows
dynamical signatures consistent with gravitational infall in the inner region,
but a slow, solid-body rotation at large scales. This flattened structure is
not a rotationally supported circumstellar disk; instead, it resembles a
prestellar core both morphologically and kinematically, representing the early

interpret both the dust continuum and N2H+ emission and suggest a possible

interiors with a novel semi-analytic spectral technique, using an eigenfunction
series expansion, that can be used to derive benchmark solutions in
hydromagnetic regimes with very high Reynolds number (10^7 - 10^8). The error
arising from the truncation of the series is evaluated analytically. The main
simplifying assumptions are the neglect of meridional circulation and of
non-axisymmetric magnetic fields. The advantages of our approach are shown by
applying it to a spin-down model for a 1 M_sun main-sequence star. The
evolution of the coupling between core and envelope is investigated for
different values of the viscosity and different geometries and values of the
poloidal field. We confirm that a viscosity enhancement by 10^4 with respect to
the molecular value is required to attain a rigid rotation in the core of the
Sun within its present age. We suggest that a quadrupolar poloidal field may
explain the short coupling time-scale needed to model the observed rotational
evolution of fast rotators on the ZAMS, while a dipolar geometry is indicated
in the case of slow rotators. Our novel semi-analytic spectral method provides
a conceptually simple and rigorous treatment of a classic MHD problem and
allows us to explore the influence of various parameters on the rotational
history of radiative interiors.

upward truncated variation and downward truncated variation. The defined

redshift range of 0.05 to 0.095, with optical (griz) photometry and
spectroscopy from SDSS-DR6 and Near-Infrared (YJHK) photometry from UKIDSS-LAS

structural parameters) are derived using grizYJHK wavebands. We find no
systematic steepening of the CM relation when probing the baseline from g-r to
g-K, implying that internal color gradients drive most of the mass-metallicity
relation in ETGs. As far as structural parameters are concerned we find that
the mean effective radius of ETGs smoothly decreases, by ~30%, from g through
K, while no significant dependence on waveband is detected for the axis ratio,
Sersic index, and a4 parameters. Also, velocity dispersions are re-measured for
all the ETGs using STARLIGHT and compared to those obtained by SDSS. We compare
our (2DPHOT) measurements of total magnitude, effective radius, and mean
surface brightness with those obtained as part of the SDSS pipeline (Photo).
Significant differences are found and reported, including comparisons with a
third and independent part. A full characterization of the sample completeness

data. Its shape depends on the shape of $X$ and a skewness parameter $\gamma$.
In particular, for symmetric $X$ and nonzero $\gamma$ the output $Y$ is skewed.
Its distribution and density function are particular variants of their input
counterparts. Maximum likelihood and method of moments estimators are
presented, and simulations show that in the symmetric case additional
estimation of $\gamma$ does not affect the quality of other parameter
estimates. Applications in finance and biomedicine show the relevance of this
class of distributions, which is particularly useful for slightly skewed data.

high-diversity code embedded within them. These diversity embedded codes were
investigated for flat fading channels both from an information theoretic
viewpoint [5] and from a coding theory viewpoint in [2]. In this paper we
explore the use of diversity embedded codes for inter-symbol interference
channels. In particular the main result of this paper is that the diversity
multiplexing trade-off for fading MISO/SIMO/SISO ISI channels is indeed
successively refinable. This implies that for fading ISI channels with a single
degree of freedom one can embed a high diversity code within a high rate code
without any performance loss (asymptotically). This is related to a
deterministic structural observation about the asymptotic behavior of frequency
response of channel with respect to fading strength of time domain taps as well

selection effects and bias due to correlated errors on r_e and mue as key
factors in obtaining meaningful FP coefficients. Studying the Kormendy relation
we find that its slope varies from g (3.44+-0.04) to K (3.80+-0.02) implying
that smaller size ETGs have a larger ratio of optical/NIR radii than galaxies
with larger re. We also examine the Faber-Jackson relation and find that its
slope is similar for all wavebands, within the uncertainties, with a mean value
of 0.198+-0.007. The variation of the FP coefficients for the magnitude
selected sample from g through K amounts to 11%, negligible, and 10%,

and dynamical differences of galaxian properties. We also show that the current
semi-analytical models of galaxy formation reproduce very well the variation of

suppressing or enhancing the electron tunneling. A presented single-level
impurity leads to the appearance of Fano lineshapes in the conductance spectra
in the absence of magnetic flux, with the positions of Fano antiresonances
determined by both the impurity-QD couplings and the QD levels separated from
the Fermi level, whereas when a magnetic flux is introduced with the the phase
factor $\phi=\pi$ the impurity-driven Breit-Wigner lineshapes appear in the
conductance curves. Besides, the nonlocal impurities alter the period of
conductance change \emph{vs} the magnetic flux. The multi-level impurities
indeed complicate the electron transport, but for the cases of two identical
local impurities coupled to the respective QDs with uniform couplings or a
nonlocal impurity coupled to both QDs uniformly, the antiresonances are only
relevant to the impurity levels. When many-body effect is managed within the

calibration of inertial frames. In a universe dominated by voids of the size
observed in large-scale structure surveys, the density contrasts of expanding
regions are strong enough that a relative deceleration of the background
between voids and the environment of galaxies, typically of order 10^{-10}
m/s^2, must be accounted for. As a result one finds a universe whose present
age varies by billions of years according to the position of the observer: a
timescape. This model universe is observationally viable: it passes three
critical independent tests, and makes additional predictions. Dark energy is
revealed as a mis-identification of gravitational energy gradients and the
resulting variance in clock rates. Understanding the biggest mystery in
cosmology therefore involves a paradigm shift, but in an unexpected direction:
the conceptual understanding of time and energy in Einstein's own theory is
incomplete.

varies with the exchange energy $E_{ex}$. For $E_{ex}<E_F$ (Fermi energy), the

the amplitude of oscillation increases with $E_{ex}$, where
$E_{ex}^{c}=2E_{F}+U_{0}$ ($U_{0}$ is the applied electrostatic potential on

be a steep drop in the albedo (by a factor of ~2) for wavelengths shorter than
~300 nm. Nevertheless, the far ultraviolet albedo of Lutetia (~10%) is
considerably larger than that of typical C-chondrite material (~4%). The
geometric albedo at 550 nm is 16.5 +/- 1%. Lutetia's reflectivity is not
consistent with a metal-dominated surface at infrared or radar wavelengths, and
its albedo at all wavelengths (UV-visibile-IR-radar) is larger than observed

simulations the bodies are connected by an elastic skin. The skin responds to
the movement of the bodies and the pressure of the fluid and alters the flow
around the bodies. In particular it prevents fluid moving between them. The
system of bodies and skin is similar in appearance to a swimming leech or
tadpole depending on the relative size of the bodies. We simulate the system
using SPH, with three types of particles: liquid particles, boundary force
particles determining the surface of the rigid bodies, and skin particles
defining the elastic skin. The latter interact with each other, and with the
boundary force particles to which they are anchored, by linear spring forces.
The boundary force particles and the skin particles interact with the fluid
particles by pair forces which are similar to the forces used in the Immersed
Boundary method. The algorithm is based on a Lagrangian, and the equations of
motion conserve linear momentum exactly and angular momentum very accurately.
We compare the motion of rigid bodies with and without skin keeping the total
mass of the bodies plus skin fixed. When the ellipses are identical, and the
forward gait is used, the bodies swim ~13% faster when they are connected by
skin, and they require less energy. When the ellipses have different sizes,
with the front ellipse largest, they travel ~39% faster and use less energy.
The algorithm is simple and robust and can be applied to bodies of arbitrary
shape and in domains which include free surfaces and stratified fluids.

Jupiters. They interact with their stars affecting their angular momentum.
Recent observations provide suggestive evidence of excess angular momentum in
stars with hot Jupiters in comparison to stars with distant and less massive
planets. This has been attributed to tidal interaction, but needs to be
investigated in more detail considering also other possible explanations
because in several cases the tidal synchronization time scales are much longer
than the ages of the stars. We select stars harbouring transiting hot Jupiters
to study their rotation and find that those with an effective temperature
greater than 6000 K and a rotation period shorter than 10 days are synchronized
with the orbital motion of their planets or have a rotation period
approximately twice that of the planetary orbital period. Stars with an
effective temperature lower than 6000 K and a rotation period longer than 10
days show a general trend toward synchronization with increasing effective
temperature or decreasing orbital period. We propose a model for the angular
momentum evolution of stars with hot Jupiters to interpret these observations.
It is based on the hypothesis that a close-in giant planet affects the coronal
field of its host star leading to a topology with predominantly closed field
lines. Our model can be tested observationally and has relevant consequences
for the relationship between stellar rotation and close-in giant planets as
well as for the application of gyrochronology to estimate the age of
planet-hosting stars.

convincingly confirmed by the numerical density matrix renormalization group

in opposite directions and are able to change lanes. The focus is on the steady
state behavior in situations where a positive current is constrained to an
extended subsystem (either by appropriate boundary conditions or by the
embedding environment) where, in the absence of the constraint, the current
would be negative. We have found two qualitatively different types of steady
states and formulated the conditions of them in terms of the transition rates.
In the first type of steady state, a localized cluster of particles forms with
an anti-shock located in the subsystem and the current vanishes exponentially
with the extension of the subsystem. This behavior is analogous to that of the
one-lane partially asymmetric simple exclusion process, and can be realized
e.g. when the local drive is induced by making the jump rates in two lanes
unequal. In the second type of steady state, which is realized e.g. if the
local drive is induced purely by the bias in the lane change rates, and which
has thus no counterpart in the one-lane model, a delocalized cluster of
particles forms which performs a diffusive motion as a whole and, as a
consequence, the current vanishes inversely proportionally to the extension of
the subsystem. The model is also studied in the presence of quenched
disordered, where, in case of delocalization, phenomenological considerations
predict anomalously slow, logarithmic decay of the current with the system size
in contrast with the usual power-law.

possess a known topology, it is possible to define an acyclic structure to
route packets between a group of Autonomous Systems. The adoption of complete
orders also allows easy identification and avoidance of persistent route
oscillations, eliminates the possibility of developing transient loops in
paths, and provides a structure that facilitates the implementation of traffic
engineering. Moreover, by combining Chain Routing with other mechanisms that
implement complete orders in time, we suggest that it is possible to design a
new routing protocol which could be more reliable and stable than BGP's current
implementation. Although Chain Routing will require an increase of the message

concentrated on stars of one solar mass. Our knowledge on the frequency of
giant planets and brown dwarf companions to more massive stars is thus rather
limited. In the case of solar-like stars, the frequency of short-period brown
dwarf companions and very massive planets seems to be low. AIMS: Here we
present evidence for a substellar companion to 30 Ari B, an F-star of 1.16
$\pm$ 0.04 $\rm M_\odot$ that is a member of a hierarchical triple system.
METHODS: The companion was detected by means of precise radial velocity
measurements using the 2-m Alfred-Jensch telescope and its 'echelle
spectrograph. An iodine absorption cell provided the wavelength reference for
precise stellar radial velocity measurements. RESULTS: We analyzed our radial
velocity measurements and derived an orbit to the companion with period, P=
335.1+/-2.5 days, eccentricity e = 0.289+/-0.092, and mass function f(m) =
(6.1+/-1.7)*10E-7 Modot. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the radial velocity
variations of 30 Ari B are due to a companion with $m$ sin $i$ of $9.88\pm0.94$
$\rm M_{Jup}$ that is either a massive planet or a brown dwarf. {The object
thus belongs to the rare class of massive planets and brown dwarfs orbiting
main- sequence stars.

spatially diffuse interfaces in multi-phase-field models of polycrystalline
materials. During late-stage solidification, crystal-melt interfaces may
attract or repel each other depending on the degree of misorientation between
impinging grains, temperature, composition, and stress. To characterize this
interaction, we map the multi-phase-field equations for stationary interfaces
to a multi-dimensional classical mechanical scattering problem. From the
solution of this problem, we derive asymptotic forms for short-range forces
between interfaces for distances larger than the interface thickness. The
results show that forces are always attractive for traditional models where
each phase-field represents the phase fraction of a given grain. Those
predictions are validated by numerical computations of forces for all
distances. Based on insights from the scattering problem, we propose a new
multi-phase-field formulation that can describe both attractive and repulsive
forces in real systems. This model is then used to investigate the influence of
solute addition and a uniaxial stress perpendicular to the interface. Solute
addition leads to bistability of different interfacial equilibrium states, with
the temperature range of bistability increasing with strength of partitioning.
Stress in turn, is shown to be equivalent to a temperature change through a
standard Clausius-Clapeyron relation. The implications of those results for

basic idea is inspired by the DGP braneworld, but one can construct a

the Galileon model can mimic the background evolution of standard $\Lambda$CDM

there exists a super-horizon growing mode in the metric and Galileon
perturbations at early times, suggesting that the background is unstable. A
fine-tuning of the initial condition for the Galileon fluctuation is thus
required in order to promote a desirable evolution of perturbations at early
times. Assuming the safe initial condition, we then compute the late-time
evolution of perturbations and discuss observational implications in Galileon

the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect and large scale structure, similar to the

They serve as low-energy input and reduce the parameter space of such theories.
In this paper Minimal supersymmetric extension of the SM is considered and
two-loop relations between known SM values of fermion masses and running
parameters of the MSSM are studied within the effective theory approach. Both
b-quark and tau-lepton have the same quantum numbers with respect to SU(2)
groupand in the MSSM acquire their masses due to interactions with the same
Higgs doublet. As a consequence, for large values of tan beta parameter
corresponding Yukawa couplings also become large and together with tan beta can
significantly enhance radiative corrections. In the case of b-quark two-loop
O(alpha_s^2) contribution to the relation between running bottom-quark mass in
QCD and MSSM is known in literature. This paper is devoted to calculation of
the NNLO corrections proportional to Yukawa couplings. For the tau-lepton
obtained contribution can be considered as a good approximation to the full

that only the sum of strong and Yukawa corrections can play such a role.

The seven planets with very accurate parameters widen the range of known planet

metallicity, rapidly rotating and active, spotted stars. CoRoT-3 populated the
brown dwarf desert and closed the gap of measured physical properties between
standard giant planets and very low mass stars. CoRoT extended the known range
of planet masses down to 5 Earth masses and up to 21 Jupiter masses, the radii
to less than 2 Earth radii and up to the most inflated hot Jupiter found so
far, and the periods of planets discovered by transits to 9 days. Two CoRoT
planets have host stars with the lowest content of heavy elements known to show
a transit hinting towards a different planet-host-star-metallicity relation

of the CoRoT-7b prove that terrestrial planets with a density close to Earth
exist outside the Solar System. The detection of the secondary transit of
CoRoT-1 at the $10^{-5}$-level and the very clear detection of the 1.7 Earth

of early start of the vaccination campaign, since ten days delay may increase
the attack rate by up to 6%. Taking into account the delay between developing
immunity and vaccination is a key factor in evaluating the impact of
vaccination campaigns. We provide a general framework which will be useful for
the next pandemic waves as well.

equations, written for amplitudes of the right-and left-traveling waves,
combine basic features of the Gross-Pitaevskii and complex Ginzburg-Landau
models. They include localized source terms, to represent the microwave
magnon-pumping field. With the source represented by the $\delta $-functions,
we find analytical solutions for symmetric localized states of the magnon
condensates. We also predict the existence of asymmetric states with unequal
amplitudes of the two components. Numerical simulations demonstrate that all
analytically found solutions are stable. With the $\delta $-function terms
replaced by broader sources, the simulations reveal a transition from the
single-peak stationary symmetric states to multi-peak ones, generated by the
modulational instability of extended nonlinear-wave patterns. In the
simulations, symmetric initial conditions always converge to symmetric
stationary patterns. On the other hand, asymmetric inputs may generate
nonstationary asymmetric localized solutions, in the form of traveling or
standing waves. Comparison with experimental results demonstrates that the
phenomenological equations provide for a reasonably good model for the
description of the spatiotemporal dynamics of magnon condensates.

evolution. Particularly in the very thin inert envelopes of subdwarf B stars,
diffusive movements will considerably change the envelope structure and the
surface abundances on a short timescale. Also, the subdwarfs will inherit the
effects of diffusion in their direct progenitors, namely giants near the tip of
the red giant branch. This will influence the global evolution and the
pulsational properties of subdwarf B stars. We investigate the impact of
gravitational settling, thermal diffusion and concentration diffusion on the
evolution and pulsations of subdwarf B stars. Our diffusive stellar models are
compared with models evolved without diffusion. We constructed subdwarf B
models with a mass of 0.465 Msun from a 1 and 3 Msun ZAMS progenitor. The low
mass star ignited helium in an energetic flash, while the intermediate mass
star started helium fusion gently. For each progenitor type we computed series
with and without atomic diffusion. Atomic diffusion in red giants causes the
helium core mass at the onset of helium ignition to be larger. We find an
increase of 0.0015 Msun for the 1 Msun model and 0.0036 Msun for the 3 Msun
model. The effects on the red giant surface abundances are small after the
first dredge up. The evolutionary tracks of the diffusive subdwarf B models are
shifted to lower surface gravities and effective temperatures due to outward
diffusion of hydrogen. This affects both the frequencies of the excited modes
and the overall frequency spectrum. Especially the structure and pulsations of
the post-non-degenerate sdB star are drastically altered, proving that atomic
diffusion cannot be ignored in these stars.

projection effects, finding that the uncertainties of the parameters can be
quite substantial. Thus while the quantification of the dynamical state of
individual clusters with these parameters should be treated with extreme
caution, these substructure measures provide powerful statistical tools to
characterise trends of properties in large cluster samples. The centre shift
parameter, w, is found to be more sensitive in general. For the REXCESS sample
neither the occurence of substructure nor the presence of cool cores depends on
cluster mass. There is a significant anti-correlation between the existence of
substantial substructure and cool cores. The simulated clusters show on average
larger substructure parameters than the observed clusters, a trend that is
traced to the fact that cool regions are more pronounced in the simulated
clusters, leading to stronger substructure measures in merging clusters and
clusters with offset cores. Moreover, the frequency of cool regions is higher
in the simulations than in the observations, implying that the description of
the physical processes shaping cluster formation in the simulations requires
further improvement.
