expansion of the quantum effective action for brane induced gravity models in

parameter, leading to the cutoff scale which is given by the geometric average
of the mass of the quantum field in the bulk and DGP scale. This cutoff is much
higher than the analogous strong coupling scale of the DGP model treated by
weak field expansion in the tree-level approximation. The lowest orders of this
curvature expansion are calculated for the case of the scalar field in the
$(d+1)$-dimensional bulk with the brane carrying the $d$-dimensional kinetic
term of this field. The ultraviolet divergences in this model are obtained for
a particular case of $d=4$.

the Very Large Array over 20 years are re-examined to determine the location
and character of the previously detected variable radio emission. The radio
emission from the system consists of a primary component that is associated
with the binary, and a non-thermal source (NE) that has been ascribed to a
wind-collision region (WCR) between the stellar winds of the binary and that of
a B-type star (Star D) to the NE. NE shows no evidence of variation in 23
epochs where it is resolved separately from the primary radio component,
demonstrating that the variable emission arises in the primary. Since NE is
non-variable, the radio flux from the primary can now be well determined for
the first time, most especially in observations that do not resolve both the
primary and NE components. The variable radio emission from the primary has a
period of 6.7+/-0.3 years which is described by a simple model of a non-thermal
source orbiting within the stellar wind envelope of the binary. Such a model
implies the presence of a third, unresolved stellar companion (Star C) orbiting
the 6.6-day binary with a period of 6.7 years. The variable non-thermal
emission arises from either a WCR between Star C and the binary system, or
possibly from Star C directly. The model gives a mass-loss rate of 3.4 x
10^{-5} solar mass/yr for Cyg OB2 #5, unusually high for an Of supergiant and
comparable to that of WR stars, and consistent with an unusually strong He I
1.083-micron emission line, also redolent of WR stars. An examination of radial
velocity observations suggests reflex motion of the binary due to Star C. The
natures of NE and Star D are also examined. (abridged)

both of which originate from the open-shell 2p electrons of O$_{2}^{-}$
molecules. The structural transition is accompanied by the coherent tilting of
O$_{2}^{-}$ molecular axes. The interplay among the spin-orbital-lattice
degrees of freedom in KO2 is investigated by employing the first-principles
electronic structure theory and the kinetic-exchange interaction scheme. We
have shown that the insulating nature of the high symmetry phase of KO2 at high
temperature (T) arises from the combined effect of the spin-orbit coupling and
the strong Coulomb correlation of O 2p electrons. In contrast, for the low
symmetry phase of KO2 at low T with the tilted O$_{2}^{-}$ molecular axes, the
band gap and the orbital ordering are driven by the combined effects of the
crystal-field and the strong Coulomb correlation. We have verified that the
emergence of the O 2p ferro-orbital ordering is essential to achieve the

possibility of studying a dwarf galaxy merging event while still in progress.
Due to its low distance (25 kpc), the main body of Sgr dSph covers a vast area
in the sky (roughly 15 x 7 degrees). Available photometric and spectroscopic
studies have concentrated either on the central part of the galaxy or on the
stellar stream, but the overwhelming majority of the galaxy body has never been
probed. The aim of the present study is twofold. On the one hand, to produce
color magnitude diagrams across the extension of Sgr dSph to study its stellar
populations, searching for age and/or composition gradients (or lack thereof).
On the other hand, to derive spectroscopic low-resolution radial velocities for
a subsample of stars to determine membership to Sgr dSph for the purpose of
high resolution spectroscopic follow-up. We used VIMOS-VLT to produce V and I
photometry and spectroscopy on 7 fields across the Sgr dSph minor and major
axis, plus 3 more centered on the associated globular clusters Terzan 7, Terzan
8 and Arp 2. A last field has been centered on M 54, lying in the center of Sgr
dSph. We present photometry for 320,000 stars across the main body of Sgr dSph,
one of the richest, and safely the most wide-angle sampling ever produced for
this fundamental object. We also provide robust memberships for more than one
hundred stars, whose high resolution spectroscopic analysis will be the object
of forthcoming papers. Sgr dSph appears remarkably uniform among the observed
fields. We confirm the presence of a main Sgr dSph population characterized
roughly by the same metallicity of 47 Tuc, but we also found the presence of
multiple populations on the peripheral fields of the galaxy, with a metallicity
spanning from [Fe/H]=-2.3 to a nearly solar value.

was performed on a $16^3\times 4$ lattice. Keeping the strange quark mass at
its physical value, we reduced the masses of the up and down quarks until,
under an increase of temperature, the system underwent a second-order phase
transition to a quark-gluon plasma. Then we measured the response of this
system to an increase in the quark density. We find that the transition is
smoothened rather than sharpened. If confirmed on a finer lattice, this finding
makes it unlikely for ongoing experimental searches to find a QCD critical

dark matter. Slowed down in the terrestrial matter, OHe is elusive for direct
methods of underground Dark matter detection like those used in CDMS

energy release in the interval of energy 2-6 keV in DAMA/NaI and DAMA/LIBRA

spherically symmetrical potential well, formed by the Yukawa tail of nuclear
scalar isoscalar attraction potential, acting on He beyond the nucleus, and
dipole Coulomb repulsion between the nucleus and OHe at distances from the
nuclear surface, smaller than the size of OHe. The window of parameters of this
potential is found, at which the sodium and/or iodine nuclei have a few keV
binding energy with OHe. At nuclear parameters, reproducing DAMA results, the
energy release predicted for detectors with chemical content other than NaI
differ in the most cases from the one in DAMA detector. In particular, it is

using pre-industrial and SRESA1B scenarios. Relatively large biases are present
for most CMs when global energy budgets and when the atmospheric, oceanic, and
land budgets are considered. Apparently, the biases do not result from
transient effects, but depend on the imperfect closure of the energy cycle in
the fluid components and on inconsistencies over land. Therefore, the planetary
emission temperature is underestimated. This may explain the CMs' cold bias. In
the pre-industrial scenario, CMs agree on the location in the mid-latitudes of
the peaks of the meridional atmospheric enthalpy transport, while large
discrepancies exist on the intensity. Disagreements on the location and
intensity of the oceanic transport peaks are serious. With increased $CO_2$
concentration, a small poleward shift of the peak and an increase in the
intensity of the atmospheric transport of up to 10% are detected in both
hemispheres. Instead, most CMs feature a decrease in the oceanic transport
intensity in the northern hemisphere and an equatorward shift of the peak in
both hemispheres. The Bjerkens compensation mechanism is active both on
climatological and interannual time scales. The peak of the total meridional
transport is typically around $35^\circ$ in both hemispheres and scenarios,
whereas disagreements on the intensity are relevant. With increased $CO_2$
concentration, the total transport increases by up to 10%, thus contributing to
polar amplification. Advances in the representation of physical processes are
definitely needed for providing a self-consistent representation of climate as
a non-equilibrium thermodynamical system.

field stars tend to be erroneously assigned as cluster members. From real data
of two open clusters (NGC 2323 and NGC 2311) we obtain that the number of

is a threshold Rs value above which the identified cluster members are severely
contaminated by field stars and the effectiveness of membership determination
is relatively small. This optimal sampling radius is \sim 14 arcmin for NGC
2323 and \sim 13 arcmin for NGC 2311. We discuss the reasons for such behavior
and the relationship between cluster radius and optimal sampling radius. We
suggest that, independently of the method used to estimate membership
probabilities, several tests using different sampling radius should be
performed in order to evaluate the existence of possible biases.

anything that can cause the identifying characteristics of the colors to
disappear can create problems in the source selection process. Quasar spectra
contain strong emission lines that can seriously affect the colors in
photometric systems in which the transmission characteristics vary abruptly and
significantly with redshift. When a strong line crosses a gap between two
filter passbands the color effects induced by the line change abruptly, and
there is also a dimming in apparent brightness compared to those redshifts
where the strong line is inside a filter passband where the transmission is
high. The strong emission lines in quasars, combined with the varying
detectability introduced by the transmission pattern of the five filters, will
result in a filter-gap footprint being imprinted on the N(z) distribution, with
more quasars being missed when a strong line falls in a filter gap. It is shown
here that a periodicity of Delta(z)~0.6 is imprinted on the redshift-number
distribution by this selection effect. Because this effect cannot be rigorously
corrected for, astronomers need to be aware of it in any investigation that
uses the SDSS N(z) distribution. Its presence also means that the SDSS quasar
data cannot be used either to confirm or to rule out the Delta(z)~0.6 redshift
period reported previously in other, unrelated quasar data.

  SVM Learning","21 pages, 1 figure",,,,"cs.LG cs.CR cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Several recent studies in privacy-preserving learning have considered the
trade-off between utility or risk and the level of differential privacy
guaranteed by mechanisms for statistical query processing. In this paper we
study this trade-off in private Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning. We
present two efficient mechanisms, one for the case of finite-dimensional
feature mappings and one for potentially infinite-dimensional feature mappings
with translation-invariant kernels. For the case of translation-invariant
kernels, the proposed mechanism minimizes regularized empirical risk in a
random Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space whose kernel uniformly approximates the
desired kernel with high probability. This technique, borrowed from large-scale
learning, allows the mechanism to respond with a finite encoding of the
classifier, even when the function class is of infinite VC dimension.
Differential privacy is established using a proof technique from algorithmic
stability. Utility--the mechanism's response function is pointwise
epsilon-close to non-private SVM with probability 1-delta--is proven by
appealing to the smoothness of regularized empirical risk minimization with
respect to small perturbations to the feature mapping. We conclude with a lower
bound on the optimal differential privacy of the SVM. This negative result
states that for any delta, no mechanism can be simultaneously
(epsilon,delta)-useful and beta-differentially private for small epsilon and
small beta.

the compact manifold is taken to be a Calabi-Yau five-fold. The resulting
effective theory is a one-dimensional N=2 super-mechanics model that exhibits
peculiar features of one-dimensional supersymmetry, such as the appearance of
fermion-only super-multiplets. The latter necessitates reducing also the
fermionic sector of M-theory, which is not normally included in the
compactification literature and is thus presented, together with the required
technology, in detail. The one-dimensional effective theory is most elegantly
described in superspace and therefore, a detailed account of one-dimensional
flat and curved N=2 superspace is provided. This includes developing the theory
of fermionic multiplets and the study of cross-couplings between 2a and 2b
multiplets. Another important aspect is the inclusion of flux. We study its
consistency conditions, its relation to supersymmetry and the way it gives rise
to a potential in the one-dimensional effective action. It is also explained
how the supersymmetry-preserving part of the potential can be obtained from a
Gukov-type superpotential. The main motivation of this compactification
scenario is rooted in the realm of cosmology. Its virtue is a democratic
treatment of spatial dimensions. As opposed to the artificial 3+7 split in most
string compactifications, the early universe starts out with all spatial
dimensions compact and small in our approach. One then seeks for dynamical ways
in which three dimensions grow large at late times. Possible realisations of
this idea are discussed both at the classical and at the quantum level.
Finally, preliminary work on Calabi-Yau five-fold compactifications of F-theory
and the resulting two-dimensional string-like actions is presented.

quantifying the gravitational wave luminosity of black hole mergers, very
little is known about the electromagnetic luminosity that might occur in
immediate conjunction with these events. We show that whenever the heat
deposited in the gas near a pair of merging black holes is proportional to its
total mass, and the surface density of the gas in the immediate vicinity is
greater than the (quite small) amount necessary to make it optically thick, the
characteristic scale of the luminosity emitted in direct association with the
merger is the Eddington luminosity independent of the gas mass. The duration of
the photon signal is proportional to the gas mass, and is generally rather
longer than the merger event. At somewhat larger distances, dissipation
associated with realigning the gas orbits to the new spin orientation of the
black hole can supplement dissipation of the energy gained from orbital
adjustment to the mass lost in gravitational radiation; these two heat sources
can combine to augment the electromagnetic radiation over longer timescales.

the most extreme blazars can be found more efficiently in hard X-rays, rather

velocities were measured from high-resolution near-infrared spectra obtained
using the CRIRES instrument on the VLT with an ammonia gas cell. The typical
internal precision of the measurements is 10 m/s. These data do not exhibit
significant variability and are essentially constant at a level consistent with
the measurement uncertainties. Therefore, we do not detect the radial velocity
variations of VB10 expected due to the presence of an orbiting giant planet
similar to that recently proposed by Pravdo and Shaklan based on apparent
astrometric perturbations. In addition, we do not confirm the ~1 km/s radial
velocity variability of the star tentatively detected by Zapatero Osorio and

regular intervals of ~12 yr during the last ~40 yr. We analyse optical
photopolarimetric monitoring data from 2005-2009, during which the latest
double-peaked outburst occurred. The aim of this study is twofold: firstly, we
aim to analyse variability patterns and statistical properties of the optical
polarization light-curve. We find a strong preferred position angle in optical
polarization. The preferred position angle can be explained by separating the
jet emission into two components: an optical polarization core and chaotic jet
emission. The optical polarization core is stable on time scales of years and
can be explained as emission from an underlying quiescent jet component. The
chaotic jet emission sometimes exhibits a circular movement in the Stokes
plane. We interpret these events as a shock front moving forwards and backwards
in the jet, swiping through a helical magnetic field. Secondly, we use our data
to assess different binary black hole models proposed to explain the regularly
appearing double-peaked bursts in OJ287. We compose a list of requirements a
model has to fulfil. The list includes not only characteristics of the
light-curve but also other properties of OJ287, such as the black hole mass and
restrictions on accretion flow properties. We rate all existing models using
this list and conclude that none of the models is able to explain all
observations. We discuss possible new explanations and propose a new approach
to understanding OJ287. We suggest that both the double-peaked bursts and the
evolution of the optical polarization position angle could be explained as a
sign of resonant accretion of magnetic field lines, a 'magnetic breathing' of
the disc.

subject to large uncertainties, the nominal derived merger rate is ~5 x 10^-4
per yr in the Milky Way, just ~3-6 and ~20-40 times less than the Type Ia and
core-collapse supernova (SN) rates, respectively. This implies that the merger
rate is ~0.5-1 x 10^4 per Gpc^3 per yr in the local universe, ~5000-10000 times
more than the observed (beaming-uncorrected) long-duration gamma-ray burst

greater than 3*10^10 Msun. This is difficult to reproduce in pure passive
evolution models, which generically predict older galaxies to be much more
compact than younger ones of the same stellar mass. However, this aspect of our
measurements is well reproduced by hierarchical models of galaxy formation.
Whereas the models predict more compact galaxies at high redshifts, subsequent
minor, dry mergers increase the sizes of the more massive objects, resulting in
a flat size-age relation at the present time. At lower masses, the models
predict that mergers are less frequent, so that the expected anti-correlation
between age and size is not completely erased. This is in good agreement with
our data: below 3*10^10 Msun, the effective radius R_e is a factor of ~2 lower

systems based on the Millennium--II Simulation. Satellite halos are defined as
sub--halos within the virial radius of a host halo. The satellite sample is
restricted to those sub--halos which showed a maximum circular velocity above
30 km/s at the time of accretion. Host halo masses range from 10^11 to 10^14
Msol/h. We compute the satellites' average accretion redshift, z_acc, velocity
dispersion, sigma, and velocity anisotropy parameter, beta, utilising stacked
satellite samples of equal mass hosts at similar background densities. The main
results are: (1) On average satellites within hosts in high density
environments are accreted earlier (Delta z~ 0.1$) compared to their
counterparts at low densities. For host masses above 5 times10^13 Msol/h this
trend weakens and may reverse for higher host masses; (2) The velocity
dispersion of satellites in low density environments follows that of the host,
i.e. no velocity bias is observed for host halos at low densities independent
of host mass. However, for low mass hosts in high density environments the
velocity dispersion of the satellites can be up to ~30% larger than that of the
host halo, i.e. the satellites are dynamically hotter than their host halos.
(3) The anisotropy parameter depends on host mass and environment. Satellites
of massive hosts show more radially biased velocity distributions. Moreover in
low density environments satellites have more radially biased velocities (Delta
beta > 0.1) compared to their counterparts in high density environments. We
believe that our approach allows to predict a similar behaviour for observed
satellite galaxy systems.

ray electrons is essential in reproducing the observed linear relationship.
Observed radio spectra, however, are shallower than what is expected of cooled

is presented to explain how relatively shallow observed spectra might arise
even in the presence of rapid synchrotron cooling by accounting for ionization
losses and other cooling mechanisms. During the commissioning of the 42-element

continuous radio spectra of these sources. We combine our observations with
high-frequency data from the literature to separate the spectra into thermal
and nonthermal components. The nonthermal components all steepen in the cm-wave
regime and cannot be well-modeled as simple power laws. The model of Thompson
et al. is consistent with our M82 results when plausible parameters are chosen,
and our results in fact significantly shrink the space of allowed model

emission lines from the hot intercluster medium (ICM). The polarization
naturally arises from resonant scattering of emission lines owing to a
quadrupole component in the radiation field produced by a centrally peaked gas
density distribution. If differential gas motions are present then a photon
emitted in one region of the cluster will be scattered in another region only
if their relative velocities are small enough and the Doppler shift of the
photon energy does not exceed the line width. This affects both the degree and
the direction of polarization. The changes in the polarization signal are in
particular sensitive to the gas motions perpendicular to the line of sight. We
calculate the expected degree of polarization for several patterns of gas
motions, including a slow inflow expected in a simple cooling flow model and a
fast outflow in an expanding spherical shock wave. In both cases, the effect of
non-zero gas velocities is found to be minor. We also calculate the
polarization signal for a set of clusters, taken from large-scale structure
simulations and evaluate the impact of the gas bulk motions on the polarization
signal. We argue that the expected degree of polarization is within reach of
the next generation of space X-ray polarimeters.

particles to coalesce when they collide. Arratia noted that the value of this

finite set almost surely if the initial value is compact: the key to both of
these facts is the observation that, because of the topology of the real line
and the continuity of Brownian sample paths, at the time when two particles
collide one or the other of them must have already collided with each particle
that was initially between them. We investigate whether such instantaneous
coalescence still occurs for coalescing systems of particles where either the
state space of the individual particles is not locally homeomorphic to an

applicable for spherical pressure-supported stellar systems spanning over ten
orders of magnitude in luminosity, as a tool to test galaxy formation theories.
We show that all of the Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies (MW dSphs) are
consistent with having formed within a halo of mass approximately 3 x 10^9 Msun
in LCDM cosmology. The faintest MW dSphs seem to have formed in dark matter
halos that are at least as massive as those of the brightest MW dSphs, despite
the almost five orders of magnitude spread in luminosity. We expand our
analysis to the full range of observed pressure-supported stellar systems and
examine their half-light I-band mass-to-light ratios. The M/L vs. half-light
mass M_1/2 relation for pressure-supported galaxies follows a U-shape, with a
broad minimum near M/L ~ 3 that spans dwarf elliptical galaxies to normal
ellipticals, a steep rise to M/L ~ 3,200 for ultra-faint dSphs, and a more
shallow rise to M/L ~ 800 for galaxy cluster spheroids.

More generally, this is true of algebras over a general commutative ring k,
with ""finite-dimensional"" replaced by ""of finite length as a k-module"".
  These results are obtained by considering the multiplication algebra M(A) of
an algebra A (the associative algebra of k-linear maps A -> A generated by left
and right multiplications by elements of A), and its behavior with respect to
nilpotence, inverse limits, and homomorphic images.
  As a corollary, it is shown that a finite-dimensional homomorphic image of an
inverse limit of finite-dimensional solvable Lie algebras over a field of
characteristic 0 is solvable.
  Examples are given showing that infinite-dimensional homomorphic images of
inverse limits of nilpotent algebras can have properties far from those of
nilpotent algebras; in particular, properties that imply that they are not
residually nilpotent.
  Several open questions and directions for further investigation are noted.

recently been treated by Bongioanni and Torrea by using a straightforward
approach of kernel estimates. Here these results are applied in certain
Laguerre settings. The procedure is fairly direct for Laguerre function

involved. The case of Laguerre function expansions of convolution type is less
straightforward. For half-integer type indices $\alpha$ we transfer the desired
results from the Hermite setting and then apply an interpolation argument based
on a device we call the {\sl convexity principle} to cover the continuous range
of $\alpha\in[-1/2,\infty)^d$. Finally, we investigate negative powers of the
Dunkl harmonic oscillator in the context of a finite reflection group acting on

It pervades
cultural markets, and manifests itself in the adoption of scientific and
technical innovations as well as the spread of social practices. Prior
empirical work on the diffusion of innovations in spatial regions or social
networks has largely focused on the spread of one particular technology among a
subset of all potential adopters. It has also been difficult to determine
whether the observed collective behaviour is driven by natural influence
processes, or whether it follows external signals such as media or marketing
campaigns. Here, we choose an online context that allows us to study social
influence processes by tracking the popularity of a complete set of
applications installed by the user population of a social networking site, thus
capturing the behaviour of all individuals who can influence each other in this
context. By extending standard fluctuation scaling methods, we analyse the
collective behaviour induced by 100 million application installations, and show
that two distinct regimes of behaviour emerge in the system. Once applications
cross a particular threshold of popularity, social influence processes induce
highly correlated adoption behaviour among the users, which propels some of the
applications to extraordinary levels of popularity. Below this threshold, the
collective effect of social influence appears to vanish almost entirely in a
manner that has not been observed in the offline world. Our results demonstrate
that even when external signals are absent, social influence can spontaneously
assume an on-off nature in a digital environment. It remains to be seen whether
a similar outcome could be observed in the offline world if equivalent
experimental conditions could be replicated.

of the Cramer Rao Lower bounds (CRLB) as a mean to approximate the errors for
large signal to noise ratios. We show here how the variance and the bias of a
MLE estimate can be expressed instead in inverse powers of the signal to noise
ratios where the first order in the variance expansion is the CRLB. As an
application we compute the second order of the variance and bias for MLE of
physical parameters from the inspiral phase of binary mergers and for noises of
gravitational wave interferometers . We also compare the improved error
estimate with existing numerical estimates. The value of the second order of
the variance expansions allows to get error predictions closer to what is
observed in numerical simulations. It also predicts correctly the necessary SNR
to approximate the error with the CRLB and provides new insight on the
relationship between waveform properties SNR and estimation errors. For example
the timing match filtering becomes optimal only if the SNR is larger than the

then the generation of a bubble universe is possible. Second, the author will
observe that a sufficient violation of the null energy condition may be

investigate the spin-1/2 XXZ model with nearest neighbor interactions on a
periodic depleted square lattice. In particular, we present results for 1/4
depleted lattice in an applied magnetic field and investigate the effect of
depletion on the ground state. The ground state phase diagram is found to
include an antiferromagnetic (AF) phase of magnetization $m_{z}=\pm 1/6$ and an
in-plane ferromagnetic (FM) phase with finite spin stiffness. The agreement
between the QMC simulations and the mean field theory based on resonating
trimers suggests the AF phase and in-plane FM phase can be interpreted as a
Mott insulator and superfluid of trimer states respectively. While the thermal
transitions of the in-plane FM phase are well described by the
Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, the quantum phase transition from the AF phase
to in-plane FM phase undergo a direct second order insulator-superfluid
transition upon increasing magnetic field.

privacy-preserving approximations of classifiers learned via (regularized)
empirical risk minimization (ERM). These algorithms are private under the

apply the output perturbation ideas of Dwork et al. (2006), to ERM
classification. Then we propose a new method, objective perturbation, for
privacy-preserving machine learning algorithm design. This method entails
perturbing the objective function before optimizing over classifiers. If the
loss and regularizer satisfy certain convexity and differentiability criteria,
we prove theoretical results showing that our algorithms preserve privacy, and
provide generalization bounds for linear and nonlinear kernels. We further
present a privacy-preserving technique for tuning the parameters in general
machine learning algorithms, thereby providing end-to-end privacy guarantees
for the training process. We apply these results to produce privacy-preserving
analogues of regularized logistic regression and support vector machines. We
obtain encouraging results from evaluating their performance on real
demographic and benchmark data sets. Our results show that both theoretically

state-of-the-art, output perturbation, in managing the inherent tradeoff

a H_2 mass of approximately 4*10^7 solar masses extending 20 kpc from a cluster
spiral galaxy, ESO 137-001, in Abell 3627. At least half of this gas is lost
permanently to the intracluster medium, as the tail extends beyond the tidal
radius of the galaxy. We also detect a hot (400-550 K) component in the tail
that is approximately 1% of the mass. The large H_2 line to IR continuum
luminosity ratio in the tail indicates that star formation is not a major
excitation source and that the gas is possibly shock-heated. This discovery
confirms that the galaxy is currently undergoing ram-pressure stripping, as
also indicated by its X-ray and Halpha tails found previously. We estimate the
galaxy is losing its warm H_2 gas at a rate of ~ 2-3 solar masses per year. The
true mass loss rate is likely higher if we account for cold molecular gas and
atomic gas. We predict that the galaxy will lose most of its gas in a single
pass through the core and place a strong upper limit on the ram-pressure
timescale of 1 Gyr. We also study the star-forming properties of the galaxy and
its tail. We identify most of the previously discovered external Halpha sources
within the tail in our 8 um data but not in our 3.6 um data; IRS spectroscopy
of the region containing these Halpha sources also reveals aromatic features
typically associated with star formation. From the positions of these HII
regions, it appears that star formation is not occurring throughout the
molecular hydrogen tail but only immediately downstream of the galaxy. Some of
these HII regions lie outside the tidal radius of the galaxy, indicating that
ram-pressure stripping can be a source of intracluster stars.

result is that the Eliashberg function $\alpha^2F(\theta,\omega)$ collapse for
all $\theta$ onto a single function of $\omega$ up to the upper cut-off energy
despite the $\theta$ dependence of the self-energy. The in-plane momentum
anisotropy is therefore predominantly due to the anisotropic band dispersion
effects. The obtained Eliashberg function has a small peak at
$\omega\approx0.05$ eV and flattens out above 0.1 eV up to the angle-dependent

bottom of the band with respect to the Fermi energy in the direction $\theta$,

is consistent only with the fluctuation spectra which have the short

that the antiferromagnetic fluctuations may not be underlying physics of the

characterize the reaction of the dressed qubit to an incident probe field. We

This system will turn the WSRT into an effective survey telescope with
scientific applications such as deep imaging surveys of the northern sky of HI
and OH emission, of the polarised continuum and efficient searches for pulsars
and transients. Such surveys will detect the HI in more than 100,000 galaxies

The measured abundances of the different types of grains are highly variable

we find a clear pattern of decreasing abundance of presolar silicate grains

their peculiar histories. Scales quantifying the intensity of aqueous
alteration and shock metamorphism in chondrites could correlate with the

degree of destruction or homogenization of presolar grains in the matrices of
primitive meteorites. To get an unbiased picture of the relative abundance of

electron-ion plasma along a homogeneous magnetic field is investigated with
2.5D high-resolution particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. The studies test
predictions of a strong amplification of short-wavelength modes of magnetic
turbulence upstream of nonrelativistic and relativistic parallel shocks
associated with supernova remnants, jets of active galactic nuclei, and
gamma-ray bursts. We find good agreement in the properties of the turbulence
observed in our simulations compared with the dispersion relation calculated
for linear waves with arbitrary orientation of ${\vec k}$. Depending on the
parameters, the backreaction on the ion beam leads to filamentation of the
ambient plasma and the beam, which in turn influences the properties of the
magnetic turbulence. For mildly- and ultra-relativistic beams, the instability
saturates at field amplitudes a few times larger than the homogeneous magnetic
field strength. This result matches our recent studies of nonrelativistically
drifting, hot cosmic-ray particles upstream of supernova-remnant shocks which
indicated only a moderate magnetic-field amplification by nonresonant
instabilities. We also demonstrate that the aperiodic turbulence generated by
the beam can provide efficient particle scattering with a rate compatible with
Bohm diffusion. Representing the ion beam as a constant external current, i.e.
excluding a backreaction of the magnetic turbulence on the beam, we observe
non-resonant parallel modes with wavelength and growth rate as predicted by
analytic calculations. In this unrealistic setup the magnetic field is
amplified to amplitudes far exceeding the homogeneous field, as observed in
recent MHD and PIC simulations.

in an effective acoustic geometry and exhibit a tiny anisotropy that could be
measurable in the present ether-drift experiments. By accepting this view of
the vacuum, one should also consider the possibility of sizeable random
fluctuations of the signal that reflect the stochastic nature of the underlying
`quantum ether' and could be erroneously interpreted as instrumental noise. To
test the present interpretation, we have extracted the mean amplitude of the
signal from various experiments with different systematics, operating both at
room temperature and in the cryogenic regime. They all give the same consistent
value < A > = O (10^{-15}) which is precisely the magnitude expected in an

a microscopic model for the interface scattering matrix. Our model includes
both spin-filtering and spin-mixing and is non-perturbative in both
transmission and spin polarization. We emphasize the importance of spin-mixing
caused by interface scattering, which has been shown to be crucial for the
creation of exotic pairing correlations in such structures. We provide
estimates for the possible magnitude of this effect in different scenarios and
discuss its dependence on various physical parameters. Our main finding is that
the shape of the interface potential has a tremendous impact on the magnitude
of the spin-mixing effect. Thus, all previous calculations, being based on
delta-function or box-shaped interface potentials, underestimate this effect
gravely. As a consequence, we find that with realistic interface potentials the
spin-mixing effect can easily be large enough to cause spin-polarized sub-gap
Andreev bound states in SC/sFM point contacts. In addition, we show that our
theory generalizes earlier models based on the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk

  We construct a galactic model as a superposition of axially symmetric stellar
components and a dust disc to analyse the intrinsic absorption efects. Dust
column density is assumed to be proportional to the far-infrared flux of the
galaxy. Along each line of sight, the observed far-infrared spectral energy
distribution is approximated with modified black body functions considering
dust components with different temperatures, allowing to determine the
temperatures and relative column densities of the dust components.
  We apply the model to the nearby galaxy M31 using the Spitzer Space Telescope
far-infrared observations for mapping dust distribution and temperature. A warm
and a cold dust component are distinguished. The temperature of the warm dust
in M31 varies between 56 and 60 K and is highest in the spiral arms; the
temperature of the cold component is mostly 15-19 K and rises up to about 25 K
at the centre of the galaxy. The intensity-weighted mean temperature of the
dust decreases from T ~32 K at the centre to T ~20 K at R ~7 kpc and outwards.
We also calculate the intrinsic UBVRIL surface brightness distributions and the
spatial luminosity distribution. The intrinsic dust extinction in the V-colour
rises from 0.25 mag at the centre to 0.4-0.5 mag at R = 6-13 kpc and decreases
smoothly thereafter. The calculated total extinction-corrected luminosity of
M31 is L_B = (3.64 pm 0.15) 10^10L_sun, corresponding to an absolute luminosity

including the determination of the response of interferometric gravitational

identification of the corresponding gauge invariant part of the metric

the determination and the use of the TT part is much more complicated and, in
turn, much less rewarding when sources are involved. It is shown here that
likewise the transverse part of the electric current in the Coulomb gauge

perturbations become non-local. This, in practice, invokes the necessity of the
use of more adequate projection operators then the ones applied, e.g, in the
weak field limit, and in many post-Newtonian considerations. It is also pointed
out that, whenever nonlinear effects are taken into account, some of the

the X-ray emission of 25 Black Hole X-ray Binaries. All publicly available
observations of the black hole binaries in the RXTE archive were analysed.
Three different types of model were fitted to investigate the spectral changes
occurring during an outburst. For the population, as well as each binary and
each outburst from each binary, we construct two diagnostic diagrams. The
Hardness Intensity/Luminosity Diagram (HID/HLD) is most useful when studying a
single binary. However, to compare between different binary systems, the Disc
Fraction Luminosity diagram (DFLD) is more useful. We discuss the limitations
of both diagnostic diagrams for the study of the X-ray binary outbursts, and we
clearly illustrate how the two diagrams map onto each other for real outburst
data. We extract the peak luminosities in a single outburst, as well as the
luminosities at the transitions away from- and returning to the powerlaw
dominated state for each outburst. The distribution of the luminosities at the
transition from the powerlaw to the disc dominated state peaks at around
0.3L_Edd, the same as the peak of the distribution of the peak luminosities in
an outburst. Using the disc fraction to calculate the transition luminosities
shows that the distributions of the luminosities for the transitions away from-
and return to the powerlaw dominated state are both broad and appear to
overlap. Finally we compare the measured X-ray luminosities with a small number
of contemporaneous radio measurements. Overall this is the most comprehensive
and uniform global study of black hole X-ray binaries to date.

production in this region. For this purpose, a series of measurements of
neutron-capture cross sections have been performed on medium-mass nuclei at the
3.7-MV Van de Graaff accelerator at FZK using the activation method. Also,
neutron captures on abundant light elements with A<56 play an important role

properties (as well as temperature for thermal emission). We present new
Spitzer data of L183 in bands that are sensitive and insensitive to PAHs. The
visual extinction AV map derived in a former paper was fitted by a series of 3D
Gaussian distributions. For different dust models, we calculate the scattered
MIR radiation images of structures that agree agree with the AV map and compare
them to the Spitzer data. The Spitzer data of L183 show emission in the 3.6 and
4.5 micron bands, while the 5.8 micron band shows slight absorption. The
emission layer of stochastically heated particles should coincide with the
layer of strongest scattering of optical interstellar radiation, which is seen
as an outer surface on I band images different from the emission region seen in
the Spitzer images. Moreover, PAH emission is expected to strongly increase
from 4.5 to 5.8 micron, which is not seen. Hence, we interpret this emission to
be MIR cloudshine. Scattered light modeling when assuming interstellar medium
dust grains without growth does not reproduce flux measurable by Spitzer. In
contrast, models with grains growing with density yield images with a flux and
pattern comparable to the Spitzer images in the bands 3.6, 4.5, and 8.0 micron.

encompass the demands of the emergency service. Cognitive Radio enhanced ad-hoc
architecture has been put forward as a candidate to enable such networks.
Spectrum sensing, the cornerstone of the Cognitive Radio paradigm, has been the
focus of intensive research, from which the main conclusion was that its
performance can be greatly enhanced through the use of cooperative sensing
schemes. To apply the Cognitive Radio paradigm to Ad-hoc disaster relief
networks, the design of effective cooperative spectrum sensing schemes is
essential. In this paper we propose a cluster based orchestration cooperative
sensing scheme, which adapts to the cluster nodes surrounding radio environment
state as well as to the degree of correlation observed between those nodes. The
proposed scheme is given both in a centralized as well as in a decentralized
approach. In the centralized approach, the cluster head controls and adapts the
distribution of the cluster sensing nodes according to the monitored spectrum
state. While in the decentralized approach, each of the cluster nodes decides
which spectrum it should monitor, according to the past local sensing decisions
of the cluster nodes. The centralized and decentralized schemes can be combined
to achieve a more robust cooperative spectrum sensing scheme. The proposed
scheme performance is evaluated through a framework, which allows measuring the
accuracy of the spectrum sensing cooperative scheme by measuring the error in
the estimation of the monitored spectrum state. Through this evaluation it is
shown that the proposed scheme outperforms the case where the choice of which
spectrum to sense is done without using the knowledge obtained in previous
sensing iterations, i.e. a implementation of a blind Round Robin scheme.

magnetic field experiencing dephasing due to external degrees of freedom. In
the absence of dephasing the model can display, depending on parameter values,
the whole range of possible transport regimes: ideal ballistic conduction,
diffusive, or ideal insulating behavior. We show that the presence of dephasing
induces normal diffusive transport in a wide range of parameters. We also
analyze the dependence of spin conductivity on the dephasing strength. In
addition, by analyzing the decay of spin-spin correlation function we discover
a presence of long-range order for finite chain sizes. All our results for a
one-dimensional spin chain at infinite temperature can be equivalently
rephrased for strongly-interacting disordered spinless fermions.

tunneling processes in a deformed microcavity. From the steady-state solution
of the coupled differential equations of chaotic modes and a high-Q regular
mode, pumping efficiency is obtained as a function of pump detuning, coupling
constants and decay rates of the involved modes. We show that the pump-excited
chaotic modes as a whole can be regarded as a single pump mode with an
effective decay rate and an effective coupling constant with the regular mode.
We also show that the decay rate of the regular mode is enhanced by dynamical
tunneling into all chaotic modes. Analysis method to obtain the effective
coupling constant from the pumping efficiencies is presented for a
two-dimensional deformed microcavity.

the discovery of pre-main sequence candidates and young embedded stellar
objects in N11 located in the Large Magellanic Cloud to cast light on the star
formation scenario. We would like to remind that this comparison is complicated
by the presence of a large age dispersion detected in the fields. Deep archive
HST/ACS photometry is used to derive color-magnitude diagrams of the
associations in N~11 and of the foreground field population. These data are
complemented by archive IR Spitzer data which allow the detection of young
embedded stellar objects. The spatial distribution of the pre-main sequence
candidates and young embedded stellar objects is compared with literature data
observed at different wavelengths, such as H$_{\alpha}$ and CO maps, and with
the distribution of OB and Herbig Ae/Be stars. The degree of clustering is
derived using the Minimal Spanning Tree method and the two point correlation
function to get insights about the formation process. A large population of
pre-main sequence candidates is found in N11. Their masses are in the range of
1.3-2 MSun for ages from 2 to 10 Myr. Young embedded stellar objects having
ages of 0.1-1 Myr are found to be intermixed with the candidate pre-main
sequence stars. The spatial distribution of the stars shows that this region is
the product of clustered star formation. No significant difference is found in
the clustering degree of young blue main sequence stars and faint pre-main
sequence candidates, suggesting that they might be part of the same formation
process. The data suggest that the star formation in the region is a
long-lasting process where stars from 0.1 to 10 Myr are widely distributed.

symmetric functions sending the first power-sum to zero and leaving the other
ones invariant. As a transformation of alphabets, this is the (1-E)-transform,
where E is the exponential alphabet, whose elementary symmetric functions are
e_n=1/n!. In the case of noncommutative symmetric functions, we recover
Schocker's idempotents for derangement numbers [Discr. Math. 269 (2003), 239].
  From these idempotents, we construct subalgebras of the descent algebras
analogous to the peak algebras and study their representation theory. The case
of WQSym leads to similar subalgebras of the Solomon-Tits algebras. In FQSym,
the study of the transformation boils down to a simple solution of the Tsetlin
library in the uniform case.

  equations","76 pages",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper is concerned with solutions to a one dimensional linear diffusion
equation and their relation to some problems in stochastic control theory. A
stochastic variational formula is obtained for the logarithm of the solution to
the diffusion equation, with terminal data which is the characteristic function
of a set. In this case the terminal data for the control problem is singular,
and hence standard theory does not apply. The variational formula is used to
prove convergence in the zero noise limit of the cost function for the
stochastic control problem and its first derivatives, to the corresponding
quantities for a classical control problem.

framework of the MIMAC detector project, which aims at directional detection of

low energy (a few keV) tracks with a gaseous \muTPC. The development of this
front end ASIC is a key point of the project, allowing the 3D track
reconstruction. Each ASIC monitors 16 strips of pixels with charge
preamplifiers and their time over threshold is provided in real time by current
discriminators via two serializing LVDS links working at 320 MHz. The charge is
summed over the 16 strips and provided via a shaper. These specifications have
been chosen in order to build an auto triggered electronics. An acquisition
board and the related software were developed in order to validate this
methodology on a prototype chamber. The prototype detector presents an anode
where 2 x 96 strips of pixels are monitored.

the leading quantum corrections to the semiclassical dynamics of the Josephson
model, describing interacting bosons able to tunnel between two localized
states. The semiclassical dynamics is known to divide between regular
oscillations and self-trapped oscillations where the sign of the imbalance
remains fixed. In both cases, the WKB wave functions are matched to Airy
functions, yielding a modified Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition. At the
critical energy dividing normal and self-trapped oscillations, the WKB wave
functions should instead be matched to parabolic cylinder functions, leading to
a quantization formula that is not just the Bohr-Sommerfeld formula, and
recovering the known logarithmic quantum break times at this energy. This work
thus provides another illustration of the usefulness of the WKB approach in
certain many-body problems.

first process dominates at higher energies and small pion-pion invariant masses
while the second becomes important at lower energies and higher pion-pion
invariant masses. The amplitude(s) is(are) calculated in the Regge approach. We
compare our results with measured cross sections for the ISR experiments at
CERN. We make predictions for future experiments at PANDA, RHIC, Tevatron and
LHC energies. Differential distributions in effective two-pion mass, pion
rapidities and transverse momenta of pions are presented. The two-dimensional
distribution in $(y_{\pi^+}, y_{\pi^-})$ is particularly interesting. The
higher the incident energy, the higher preference for the same-hemisphere

to the total nucleon-nucleon cross section as well as to pion inclusive cross
section.

have witnessed the entire history of our Galaxy, the Milky Way. Although recent
results suggest that their formation may have been more complex than previously
thought, they still are the best approximation to a stellar population formed
over a relatively short time scale (less than 1 Gyr) and with virtually no
dispersion in the iron content. Indeed, only one cluster-like system (omega
Centauri) in the Galactic halo is known to have multiple stellar populations
with a significant spread in iron abundance and age4,5. Similar findings in the
Galactic bulge have been hampered by the obscuration arising from thick and
varying layers of interstellar dust. Here we report that Terzan 5, a
globular-cluster-like system in the Galactic bulge, has two stellar populations
with different iron content and ages. Terzan 5 could be the surviving remnant
of one of the primordial building blocks that are thought to merge and form
galaxy bulges.
