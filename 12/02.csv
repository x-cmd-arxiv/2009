cosmological simulation. Using positions of haloes above a given mass as node
tracers, we look for filaments between them using the positions and masses of
all the remaining dark-matter haloes. In order to detect a filament, the first
step consists in the construction of a backbone linking two nodes, which is
given by a skeleton-like path connecting the highest local dark matter (DM)
density traced by non-node haloes. The filament quality is defined by a density
and gap parameters characterising its skeleton, and filament members are
selected by their binding energy in the plane perpendicular to the filament.
This membership condition is associated to characteristic orbital times;
however if one assumes a fixed orbital timescale for all the filaments, the
resulting filament properties show only marginal changes, indicating that the
use of dynamical information is not critical for the method. We test the method
in the simulation using massive haloes($M>10^{14}$h$^{-1}M_{\odot}$) as
filament nodes. The main properties of the resulting high-quality filaments
(which corresponds to $\simeq33%$ of the detected filaments) are, i) their
lengths cover a wide range of values of up to $150 $h$^{-1}$Mpc, but are mostly
concentrated below 50h$^{-1}$Mpc; ii) their distribution of thickness peaks at
$d=3.0$h$^{-1}$Mpc and increases slightly with the filament length; iii) their
nodes are connected on average to $1.87\pm0.18$ filaments for $\simeq
10^{14.1}M_{\odot}$ nodes; this number increases with the node mass to $\simeq
2.49\pm0.28$ filaments for $\simeq 10^{14.9}M_{\odot}$ nodes.

we investigate junction conditions across the surfaces of stars and obtain the

pressure of a star does not necessarily vanish on its surface even without the

$k$-means algorithm; $k$-means is difficult to analyze mathematically, and few
theoretical guarantees are known about it, particularly when the data is {\em
well-clustered}. In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap in the literature
by analyzing the behavior of $k$-means on well-clustered data. In particular,
we study the case when each cluster is distributed as a different Gaussian --
or, in other words, when the input comes from a mixture of Gaussians.
  We analyze three aspects of the $k$-means algorithm under this assumption.
First, we show that when the input comes from a mixture of two spherical
Gaussians, a variant of the 2-means algorithm successfully isolates the
subspace containing the means of the mixture components. Second, we show an
exact expression for the convergence of our variant of the 2-means algorithm,
when the input is a very large number of samples from a mixture of spherical
Gaussians. Our analysis does not require any lower bound on the separation
between the mixture components.
  Finally, we study the sample requirement of $k$-means; for a mixture of 2
spherical Gaussians, we show an upper bound on the number of samples required
by a variant of 2-means to get close to the true solution. The sample
requirement grows with increasing dimensionality of the data, and decreasing
separation between the means of the Gaussians. To match our upper bound, we
show an information-theoretic lower bound on any algorithm that learns mixtures
of two spherical Gaussians; our lower bound indicates that in the case when the
overlap between the probability masses of the two distributions is small, the
sample requirement of $k$-means is {\em near-optimal}.

cosmological evolution and accretion processes associated with these gargantuan
compact objects. More generally, the observations will enable testing general
relativity in the strong, nonlinear regime and will provide independent
cosmological measurements to high precision. Understanding the conditions under
which coincidences of EM and GW signatures arise during supermassive black hole
mergers is therefore of paramount importance. As an essential step towards this
goal, we present results from the first fully general relativistic,
hydrodynamical study of the late inspiral and merger of equal-mass, spinning
supermassive black hole binaries in a gas cloud. We find that variable EM
signatures correlated with GWs can arise in merging systems as a consequence of
shocks and accretion combined with the effect of relativistic beaming. The most
striking EM variability is observed for systems where spins are aligned with
the orbital axis and where orbiting black holes form a stable set of density
wakes, but all systems exhibit some characteristic signatures that can be
utilized in searches for EM counterparts. In the case of the most massive
binaries observable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, calculated
luminosities imply that they may be identified by EM searches to z = 1, while
lower mass systems and binaries immersed in low density ambient gas can only be

exotic pairing mechanism (FFLO) where magnetism is accommodated by formation of

analogous to electrons in 1D wires. At finite spin imbalance, the system phase
separates with an inverted phase profile in comparison to the three-dimensional

either a completely paired BCS superfluid or a fully polarized Fermi gas,
depending on the degree of polarization. Our observations are in quantitative
agreement with theoretical calculations in which the partially polarized phase
is found to be a 1D analogue of the FFLO state. This study demonstrates how

pre-defined causal order. The simplest example of such a transformation is the
classical switch of black boxes, where two input black boxes are arranged in
two different orders conditionally on the value of a classical bit. The quantum
version of this transformation-the quantum switch-produces an output circuit
where the order of the connections is controlled by a quantum bit, which
becomes entangled with the circuit structure. Simulating these transformations
in a circuit with fixed causal structure requires either postselection, or an
extra query to the input black boxes.

experimentally controlled with an as yet unmatched degree of precision. Due to
the control of the motion and the internal degrees of freedom, these quantum
systems can be adequately described by a well known Hamiltonian. In this
colloquium, we present powerful numerical tools for the optimization of the
external control of the motional and internal states of trapped neutral atoms,
explicitly applied to the case of trapped laser-cooled ions in a segmented
ion-trap. We then delve into solving inverse problems, when optimizing trapping
potentials for ions. Our presentation is complemented by a quantum mechanical
treatment of the wavepacket dynamics of a trapped ion. Efficient numerical
solvers for both time-independent and time-dependent problems are provided.
Shaping the motional wavefunctions and optimizing a quantum gate is realized by
the application of quantum optimal control techniques. The numerical methods
presented can also be used to gain an intuitive understanding of quantum
experiments with trapped ions by performing virtual simulated experiments on a

opportunities of the next decade. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST)
will have an effective aperture of 6.7 meters and an imaging camera with field

20,000 deg^2 south of +15 deg. Each pointing will be imaged 2000 times with
fifteen second exposures in six broad bands from 0.35 to 1.1 microns, to a
total point-source depth of r~27.5. The LSST Science Book describes the basic
parameters of the LSST hardware, software, and observing plans. The book
discusses educational and outreach opportunities, then goes on to describe a
broad range of science that LSST will revolutionize: mapping the inner and
outer Solar System, stellar populations in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies,
the structure of the Milky Way disk and halo and other objects in the Local
Volume, transient and variable objects both at low and high redshift, and the
properties of normal and active galaxies at low and high redshift. It then
turns to far-field cosmological topics, exploring properties of supernovae to
z~1, strong and weak lensing, the large-scale distribution of galaxies and
baryon oscillations, and how these different probes may be combined to
constrain cosmological models and the physics of dark energy.

often too faint for parametric spectral modeling using well-established methods
such as fitting with XSPEC. We discuss the estimation of apparent and intrinsic
broad-band X-ray fluxes and soft X-ray absorption from gas along the line of
sight to these sources, using nonparametric methods. Apparent flux is estimated
from the ratio of the source count rate to the instrumental effective area
averaged over the chosen band. Absorption, intrinsic flux, and errors on these
quantities are estimated from comparison of source photometric quantities with
those of high S/N spectra that were simulated using spectral models
characteristic of the class of astrophysical sources under study. The concept
of this method is similar to the long-standing use of color-magnitude diagrams
in optical and infrared astronomy, with X-ray median energy replacing color
index and X-ray source counts replacing magnitude. Our nonparametric method is
tested against the apparent spectra of 2000 faint sources in the Chandra
observation of the rich young stellar cluster in the M17 HII region. We show
that the intrinsic X-ray properties can be determined with little bias and
reasonable accuracy using these observable photometric quantities without
employing often uncertain and time-consuming methods of non-linear parametric
spectral modeling. Our method is calibrated for thermal spectra characteristic
of stars in young stellar clusters, but recalibration should be possible for
some other classes of faint X-ray sources such as extragalactic AGN.

probability. However, those ones which do so provide a very general and rich
mathematical structure, including classical probabilities, quantum mechanics as
well as Jordan algebras. This structure exhibits some similarities with Alfsen
and Shultz's non-commutative spectral theory, but these two mathematical
approaches are not identical. Barnum, Emerson and Ududec adapted the concept of
higher-order interference, introduced by Sorkin in 1994, into a general
probabilistic framework. Their adaption is used here to reveal a close link
between the existence of the Jordan product and the non-existence of
interference of third or higher order in those quantum logics which entail a
reasonable calculus of conditional probability. The complete characterization
of the Jordan algebraic structure requires the following three further
postulates: a Hahn-Jordan decomposition property for the states, a polynomial
functional calculus for the observables, and the positivity of the square of an
observable. While classical probabilities are characterized by the absence of
any kind of interference, the absence of interference of third (and higher)
order thus characterizes a probability calculus which comes close to quantum
mechanics, but still includes the exceptional Jordan algebras.

that this is indeed the case and assuming that there are no intermediate energy

the mass of the Higgs boson $m_H$ can be predicted. For a positive gravity
induced anomalous dimension $A_\lambda>0$ the running of the quartic scalar
self interaction $\lambda$ at scales beyond the Planck mass is determined by a
fixed point at zero. This results in $m_H=m_{\rm min}=126$ GeV, with only a few
GeV uncertainty. This prediction is independent of the details of the short
distance running and holds for a wide class of extensions of the SM as well.
For $A_\lambda <0$ one finds $m_H$ in the interval $m_{\rm min}< m_H < m_{\rm

short distance running. The case $A_\lambda>0$ is favored by explicit

A simple algorithm is developed to convert the measured $\gamma$-ray rates into

show that our theory can account for the Invar effects in iron-nickel alloys,
the anomalies being driven by the magnetic contributions to the average free
energies. Second, we present evidence indicating that the relationship between
thermal expansion and magnetism is essentially the same in all the studied
alloys, including those which display the Invar effect and those which do not.
Hence we propose that magnetism plays a crucial role in determining whether a

The crucial determining factor is the rate at which the relative orientation of
the local magnetic moments of nearest-neighbor iron atoms fluctuates as the

length by averaging the graininess of the quantum manifold in the flat space
case. As a result we obtain that, for large diffusion times, the quantum
spacetime behaves like a smooth differential manifold of discrete dimension. On
the other hand, for smaller diffusion times, the spacetime looks like a fractal
surface with a reduced effective dimension. For the specific case in which the
diffusion time has the size of the minimal length, the spacetime turns out to
have a spectral dimension equal to 2, suggesting a possible renormalizable
character of gravity in this regime. For smaller diffusion times, the spectral
dimension approaches zero, making any physical interpretation less reliable in
this extreme regime. We extend our result to the presence of a background field
and curvature. We show that in this case the spectral dimension has a more
complicated relation with the diffusion time, and conclusions about the
renormalizable character of gravity become less straightforward with respect to
what we found with the flat space analysis.

driven by various noises. Appropriate sample spaces are needed in order to
facilitate a random dynamical systems approach for stochastic differential
equations. The noise could be white or colored, Gaussian or non-Gaussian,
Markov or non-Markov, and semimartingale or non-semimartingale. Typical noises
are defined in terms of Brownian motion, Levy motion and fractional Brownian
motion. In each of these cases, a canonical sample space with an appropriate
metric (or topology that gives convergence concept) is introduced. Basic
properties of canonical sample spaces, such as separability and completeness,
are then discussed.
  Moreover, a flow defined by shifts, is introduced on these canonical sample
spaces. This flow has an invariant measure which is the probability
distribution for Brownian motion, or Levy motion or fractional Brownian motion.
Thus canonical sample spaces are much richer in mathematical structures than
the usual sample spaces in probability theory, as they have metric or
topological structures, together with a shift flow (or driving flow) defined on
it. This facilitates dynamical systems approaches for studying stochastic
differential equations.

the star moves. These moving hot spots can be produced both during stable
accretion, where matter falls near the magnetic poles of the star, and unstable
accretion, characterized by the presence of several tongues of matter which
fall on the star near the equator, due to Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities.
Precise modeling with Monte Carlo simulations shows that those movements could
be observed as high frequency Quasi Periodic Oscillations. We performed a
number of new simulation runs with a much wider set of parameters, focusing on
neutron stars with a small misalignment angle. In most cases we observe
oscillations whose frequency is correlated with the mass accretion rate

surface brightness and temperature, known as ""cold fronts"". In relaxed clusters
with cool cores, these commonly observed edges have been interpreted as
evidence for the ""sloshing"" of the core gas in the cluster's gravitational
potential. Such sloshing may provide a source of heat to the cluster core by
mixing hot gas from the cluster outskirts with the cool core gas. Using
high-resolution $N$-body/Eulerian hydrodynamics simulations, we model gas
sloshing in galaxy clusters initiated by mergers with subclusters. The
simulations include merger scenarios with gas-filled and gasless subclusters.
The effect of changing the viscosity of the intracluster medium is also
explored. We find that sloshing can facilitate heat inflow to the cluster core,
provided that there is a strong enough disturbance. In adiabatic simulations,
we find that sloshing can raise the entropy floor of the cluster core by nearly
an order of magnitude in the strongest cases. If the ICM is viscous, the mixing
of gases with different entropies is decreased and consequently the heat flux
to the core is diminished. In simulations where radiative cooling is included,
we find that though eventually a cooling flow develops, sloshing can prevent
the significant buildup of cool gas in the core for times on the order of a Gyr
for small disturbances and a few Gyr for large ones. If repeated encounters
with merging subclusters sustain the sloshing of the central core gas as is
observed, this process can provide a relatively steady source of heat to the
core, which can help to prevent a significant cooling flow.

techniques that apply the theory of linear maps (in particular, eigenvalues and
eigenvectors) to matrices that do not represent geometric transformations, but
rather some kind of relationship between entities. Albeit recently made famous
by the ample press coverage of Google's PageRank algorithm, spectral ranking
was devised more than a century ago, and has been studied in tournament
ranking, psychology, social sciences, bibliometrics, economy and choice theory.
We describe the contribution given by previous scholars in precise and modern
mathematical terms: along the way, we show how to express in a general way
damped rankings, such as Katz's index, as dominant eigenvectors of perturbed
matrices, and then use results on the Drazin inverse to go back to the dominant
eigenvectors by a limit process. The result suggests a regularized definition
of spectral ranking that yields for a general matrix a unique vector depending

high p_T (1<p_T<5 GeV/c) an enhanced e^+e^- pair yield is observed that is

infer the yield of real direct photons. In central Au+Au collisions, the excess
of the direct photon yield over the p+p is exponential in p_T, with inverse

that pairwise entanglement fails in the characterization of the infinite-order

setting: point sets in {0,1}^d under the Hamming distance. Recall that here H
is said to be an (r, cr, p, q)-sensitive hash family if all pairs x, y in
{0,1}^d with dist(x,y) at most r have probability at least p of collision under
a randomly chosen h in H, whereas all pairs x, y in {0,1}^d with dist(x,y) at
least cr have probability at most q of collision. Typically, one considers d
tending to infinity, with c fixed and q bounded away from 0.
  For its applications to approximate nearest neighbor search in high
dimensions, the quality of an LSH family H is governed by how small its ""rho
parameter"" rho = ln(1/p)/ln(1/q) is as a function of the parameter c. The
seminal paper of Indyk and Motwani showed that for each c, the extremely simple
family H = {x -> x_i : i in d} achieves rho at most 1/c. The only known lower
bound, due to Motwani, Naor, and Panigrahy, is that rho must be at least .46/c
(minus o_d(1)).
  In this paper we show an optimal lower bound: rho must be at least 1/c (minus
o_d(1)). This lower bound for Hamming space yields a lower bound of 1/c^2 for
Euclidean space (or the unit sphere) and 1/c for the Jaccard distance on sets;
both of these match known upper bounds. Our proof is simple; the essence is
that the noise stability of a boolean function at e^{-t} is a log-convex

August/September 2005, which reached a maximum X-ray flux of 400mCrab in the
5-100keV range. The outburst was observed by INTEGRAL and RXTE. The energy of
the fundamental cyclotron line has been measured with INTEGRAL and RXTE at
~45keV. Flaring activity was observed during the rise to the peak of the
outburst. RXTE observations during one of these flares found the energy of the
fundamental cyclotron line shifted to a significantly higher position than
during the rest of the outburst, where it remains constant. Also, the
energy-dependent pulse profiles during the flare differ significantly from the
rest of the outburst. These differences have been interpreted with the presence
of magnetospheric instabilities at the onset of the accretion.
  A decomposition method is applied to A 0535+26 pulse profiles. Basic
assumptions of the method are that the asymmetry observed in the pulse profiles
is caused by a distorted magnetic dipole field, and that the emission regions
have axisymmetric beam patterns. Using pulse profiles obtained from RXTE
observations, the contribution of the two emission regions has been
disentangled. Constraints on geometry of the pulsar and a possible solution of
the beam pattern are given. First results of the comparison of the
reconstructed beam pattern with a geometrical model that includes relativistic
light deflection are presented.

galaxies morphologically selected by visual inspection from the SDSS in the
redshift range 0.05<z<0.06. We find that the distribution of ages is bimodal
with a strong peak at old ages and a secondary peak at young ages around ~
2.5Gyr containing about 10 per cent of the objects. This is analogue to 'red
sequence' and 'blue cloud' identified in galaxy populations usually containing
both early and late type galaxies. The fraction of the young, rejuvenated
galaxies increases with both decreasing galaxy mass and decreasing
environmental density up to about 45 per cent. The rejuvenated galaxies have
lower alpha/Fe ratios than the average and most of them show signs of ongoing
star formation through their emission line spectra. All objects that host AGN
in their centres without star formation are part of the red sequence
population. We confirm and statistically strengthen earlier results that
luminosity weighted ages, metallicities, and alpha/Fe element ratios of the red
sequence population correlate well with velocity dispersion and galaxy mass.
Most interestingly, however, these scaling relations are not sensitive to
environmental densities and are only driven by galaxy mass. We infer that
early-type galaxy formation has undergone a phase transition a few billion
years ago around z~0.2. A self-regulated formation phase without environmental
dependence has recently been superseded by a rejuvenation phase, in which the
environment plays a decisive role possibly through galaxy interactions.

signal of clusters detected in weak-lensing maps into virial masses. However,
this step is not necessary for constraining cosmology with the shear-peak
abundance, if we are able to predict its amplitude. We generate a large
ensemble of N-body simulations spanning four cosmological models, with total
volume V~1 (Gpc/h)^3 per model. Variations to the matter density parameter and
amplitude of fluctuations are considered. We measure the abundance of peaks in
the mass density projected in ~100 Mpc/h slabs to determine the impact of
structures spatially correlated with the simulation clusters, identified by the
3D friends-of-friends algorithm. The halo model shows that the choice of the
smoothing filter for the density field is important in reducing the
contribution of correlated projections to individual halo masses. Such
contributions are less than 2% in the case of the optimal, compensated filter
used throughout this analysis. We measure the change in the mass of peaks when
projected in slabs of various thicknesses. Peaks in slabs of 26 Mpc/h and 102
Mpc/h suffer an average mass change of less than 2% compared to their mass in
slabs of 51 Mpc/h. We then explore the cosmology dependence of the
projected-peak mass function, and find that, for a wide range of slab
thicknesses (<500 Mpc/h), it scales with cosmology in exactly the same way as
the 3D friends-of-friends mass function and the Sheth-Tormen formula. This
extends the earlier result of Marian et al. (2009). Finally, we show that for
all cosmological models considered, the low and intermediate mass bins of the
peak abundance can be described using a modified Sheth-Tormen functional form
to within 10%-20% accuracy.

lacks a prominent second maximum in the i band as do low-luminosity SNe Ia. Its
spectra are similar to those of low-luminosity SNe Ia, containing features that
are only present in cool SN photospheres. Light-curve fitting methods suggest
that SN 2006bt is reddened by a significant amount of dust; however, it
occurred in the outskirts of its early-type host galaxy and has no strong Na D
absorption in any of its spectra, suggesting a negligible amount of host-galaxy
dust absorption. C II is possibly detected in our pre-maximum spectra, but at a
much lower velocity than other elements. The progenitor was likely very old,
being a member of the halo population of a galaxy that shows no signs of recent
star formation. SNe Ia have been very successfully modeled as a one-parameter
family, and this is fundamental to their use as cosmological distance
indicators. SN 2006bt is a challenge to that picture, yet its relatively normal
light curves allowed SN 2006bt to be included in cosmological analyses. We
generate mock SN Ia datasets which indicate that contamination by similar
objects will both increase the scatter of a SN Ia Hubble diagram and
systematically bias measurements of cosmological parameters. However, spectra
and rest-frame i-band light curves should provide a definitive way to identify
and eliminate such objects.

using the CMB data is crucial not only to discriminate inflationary models but
also to test alternative scenarios. Non-Gaussianity offers, therefore, a
powerful probe of the physics of the primordial universe. The extraction of
primordial non-Gaussianity is a difficult enterprise since several effects of
non-primordial nature can produce non-Gaussianity. Most of the Gaussianity
analyses of CMB data have been performed by using part-sky frequency, where
masks are used to deal with the galactic diffuse foreground emission. However,
full-sky map seems to be potentially more appropriate to test for Gaussianity
of the CMB data. On the other hand, masks can induce bias in some
non-Gaussianity analyses. Here we use two recent large-angle non-Gaussianity
indicators, based on skewness and kurtosis of large-angle patches of CMB maps,
to examine the question of non-Gaussianity in the available full-sky five-year
and seven-year WMAP maps. We show that these full-sky foreground-reduced maps
present a significant deviation from Gaussianity of different levels, which
vary with the foreground-reducing procedures. We also make a Gaussianity
analysis of the foreground-reduced five-year and seven-year WMAP maps with a
KQ75 mask, and compare with the similar analysis performed with the full-sky
foreground-reduced maps. This comparison shows a significant reduction in the
levels of non-Gaussianity when the mask is employed, which provides indications
on the suitability of the foreground-reduced maps as Gaussian reconstructions
of the full-sky CMB.

of a line source radiating in the Maxwell fisheye and the Veselago-Pendry slab
lens. The former optical medium is deduced from the stereographic projection of
a virtual sphere and displays a heterogeneous refractive index n(r) which is
proportional to the inverse of 1+r^2. The latter is described by a homogeneous,
but negative, refractive index. It has been suggested that the fisheye makes a
perfect lens without negative refraction [Leonhardt, Philbin
arxiv:0805.4778v2]. However, we point out that the definition of
super-resolution in such a heterogeneous medium should be computed with respect
to the wavelength in a homogenized medium, and it is perhaps more adequate to
talk about a conjugate image rather than a perfect image (the former does not
necessarily contains the evanescent components of the source). We numerically
find that both the Maxwell fisheye and a thick silver slab lens lead to a
resolution close to lambda/3 in transverse magnetic polarization (electric
field pointing orthogonal to the plane). We note a shift of the image plane in
the latter lens. We also observe that two sources lead to multiple secondary
images in the former lens, as confirmed from light rays travelling along
geodesics of the virtual sphere. We further observe resolutions ranging from
lambda/2 to nearly lambda/4 for magnetic dipoles of varying orientations of
dipole moments within the fisheye in transverse electric polarization (magnetic
field pointing orthogonal to the plane). Finally, we analyse the Eaton lens for
which the source and its image are either located within a unit disc of air, or
within a corona 1<r<2 with refractive index $n(r)=\sqrt{2/r-1}$. In both cases,
the image resolution is about lambda/2.

Symmetries of this type, which assign charges to H_u and H_d that forbid a tree
level \mu term, play an important role in scenarios for neutrino physics and
gauge mediation that have been proposed in local F-theory model building. As
demonstrated in arXiv:0906.4672, the presence of such a symmetry implies the
existence of non-GUT exotics in the spectrum, when hypercharge flux is used to
break the GUT group and to give rise to doublet-triplet splitting. These
exotics are of precisely the right type to solve the unification problem in
such F-theory models and might also comprise a non-standard messenger sector
for gauge mediation. We present a detailed description of models with U(1)_PQ
in the semi-local regime, which does not depend on details of any specific
Calabi-Yau four-fold, and then specialize to the geometry of arXiv:0904.3932 to
construct three-generation examples with the minimal allowed number of non-GUT
exotics. Among these, we find a handful of models in which the D3-tadpole
constraint can be satisfied without requiring the introduction of
anti-D3-branes. Finally, because SU(5) singlets that carry U(1)_PQ charge may
serve as candidate right-handed neutrinos or can be used to lift the exotics,
we study their origin in compact models and motivate a conjecture for how to
count their zero modes in a semi-local setting.

$\xi=E_0/E_0^{free}$ where $E_0$ is the true ground-state energy of the system,
and $E_0^{free}$ is that for the non-interacting system. In the limit of
$a_s\to \pm \infty$, often referred to as the unitary limit, this ratio is
expected to approach a universal constant, namely $\xi\sim 0.44(1)$. In the
present work we calculate this ratio $\xi$ using a family of hard-core
square-well potentials whose $a_s$ can be exactly obtained, thus enabling us to
have many potentials of different ranges and strengths, all with infinite
$a_s$. We have also calculated $\xi$ using a unitarity CDBonn potential
obtained by slightly scaling its meson parameters. The ratios $\xi$ given by
these different unitarity potentials are all close to each other and also
remarkably close to 0.44, suggesting that the above ratio $\xi$ is indifferent
to the details of the underlying interactions as long as they have infinite

low-momentum interaction in neutron matter at the unitary limit is discussed.

early-type, red sequence galaxies with Spitzer/IRAC imaging in order to
investigate the presence of trace star formation in these systems. With the
Spitzer data, we identify galaxies hosting low-level star formation, as traced
by PAH emission, with measured star formation rates that compare well to those
estimated from other tracers. This star formation proceeds according to
established scaling relations with molecular gas content, in surface density
regimes characteristic of disk galaxies and circumnuclear starbursts. We find
that star formation in early-type galaxies happens exclusively in fast-rotating
systems and occurs in two distinct modes. In the first, star formation is a
diffuse process, corresponding to widespread young stellar populations and high
molecular gas content. The equal presence of co- and counter-rotating
components in these systems strongly implies an external origin for the
star-forming gas, and we argue that these star formation events may be the
final stages of (mostly minor) mergers that build up the bulges of red sequence
lenticulars. In the second mode of star formation, the process is concentrated
into well-defined disk or ring morphologies, outside of which the host galaxies
exhibit uniformly evolved stellar populations. This implies that these star
formation events represent rejuvenations within previously quiescent stellar
systems. Evidence for earlier star formation events similar to these in all
fast rotating early-type galaxies suggests that this mode of star formation may
be common to all such galaxies, with a duty cycle of roughly 1/10, and likely
contributes to the embedded, co-rotating inner stellar disks ubiquitous in this
population.

information on the gas kinematics, stellar populations and galactic potential
from the SAURON data, and use the SAURON-specific diagnostic diagram
juxtaposing the [OIII]/Hb and [NI]/Hb line ratios. We find a tight correlation
between the stellar surface brightness and the flux of the Hb recombination
line across our sample, which points to a diffuse and old stellar source as the
main contributor of ionising photons in early-type galaxies, with
post-asymptotic giant branch (pAGB) stars being still the best candidate based
on ionising-balance arguments. Other ionising sources such as a central AGN,
OB-stars, shocks or the interaction between the hot and warm phases of the
interestellar medium are found to play only a limited or localised role in
powering the diffuse nebular emission observed in our sample galaxies. These
results lead us to investigate the relative importance of stellar and AGN
photoionisation in explaining the ionised-gas emission observed in early-type
galaxies by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). By simulating how our sample
galaxies would appear if placed at further distance and targeted by the SDSS,
we conclude that only in very few, if any, of the SDSS early-type galaxies that
display modest values for the equivalent width of the [OIII] line (less than
~2.4\AA) and LINER-like [OIII]/Hb values, the nebular emission is truly powered

of 40 quasars at redshifts 5.74 < z < 6.42. Our binned luminosity function
shows a slightly lower normalisation and flatter slope than found in previous
work. The binned data also suggest a break in the luminosity function at M_1450
approx -25. A double power law maximum likelihood fit to the data is consistent
with the binned results. The luminosity function is strongly constrained (1
sigma uncertainty < 0.1 dex) over the range -27.5 < M_1450 < -24.7. The
best-fit parameters are Phi(M_1450^*) = 1.14 x 10^-8 Mpc^-3 mag^-1, break
magnitude M_1450^* = -25.13 and bright end slope beta = -2.81. However the

find -3.8 < beta < -2.3 at 95% confidence. We calculate the z = 6 quasar

known shock structures. In the main shock region alone we find 5.0
$\times10^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$ of warm H$_2$ spread over $\sim$ 480 kpc$^2$ and
additionally report the discovery of a second major shock-excited H$_2$
feature. This brings the total H$_2$ line luminosity of the group in excess of
10$^42$ erg/s. In the main shock, the H$_2$ line luminosity exceeds, by a
factor of three, the X-ray luminosity from the hot shocked gas, confirming that
the H$_2$-cooling pathway dominates over the X-ray. [Si II]34.82$\mu$m
emission, detected at a luminosity of 1/10th of that of the H$_2$, appears to
trace the group-wide shock closely and in addition, we detect weak
[FeII]25.99$\mu$m emission from the most X-ray luminous part of the shock.
Comparison with shock models reveals that this emission is consistent with
regions of fast shocks (100 < $V_{s}$ < 300 km/s) experiencing depletion of
iron and silicon onto dust grains. Star formation in the shock (as traced via
ionic lines, PAH and dust emission) appears in the intruder galaxy, but most
strikingly at either end of the radio shock. The shock ridge itself shows
little star formation, consistent with a model in which the tremendous H$_{2}$
power is driven by turbulent energy transfer from motions in a post-shocked
layer. The significance of the molecular hydrogen lines over other measured
sources of cooling in fast galaxy-scale shocks may have crucial implications
for the cooling of gas in the assembly of the first galaxies.

keys. A hash table can be constructed successfully if each key can be placed

systems. Their origin, however, is still poorly understood. When cosmic
structures form, they grow in mass via accretion from the surrounding
environment. We propose that this accretion is able to drive internal turbulent
motions in a wide range of astrophysical objects and study this process in the
case of galaxies, molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks. We use a
combination of numerical simulations and analytical arguments to predict the
level of turbulence as a function of the accretion rate, the dissipation scale,
and the density contrast, and compare with observational data. We find that in
Milky Way type galaxies the observed level of turbulence in the interstellar
medium can be explained by accretion, provided that the galaxies gain mass at a
rate comparable to the rate at which they form stars. This process is
particularly relevant in the extended outer disks beyond the star-forming
radius. We also calculate the rate at which molecular clouds grow in mass when
they build up from the atomic component of the galactic gas and find that their
internal turbulence is likely to be driven by accretion as well. It is the very
process of cloud formation that excites turbulent motions on small scales by
establishing the turbulent cascade. In the case of T Tauri disks, we show that
accretion can drive subsonic turbulence at the observed level if the rate at
which gas falls onto the disk is comparable to the rate at which disk material
accretes onto the central star. This also explains the observed relation of
accretion rate and stellar mass, dM/dt ~ M^1.8. The efficiency required to
convert infall motion into turbulence is of the order of a few percent in all
three cases. We conclude that accretion-driven turbulence is a universal
concept with far-reaching implications for a wide range of astrophysical
objects.

X-ray pulsar 1E 1547.0-5408 in January 2009, during which about 200 bursts were
detected by INTEGRAL. The major activity episode happened when the source was
outside the field of view of all the INTEGRAL instruments. But we were still
able to study the properties of 84 bursts detected simultaneously by the
anti-coincidence shield of the spectrometer SPI and by the detector of the
imager ISGRI. We find that the luminosity of the 22 January 2009 bursts of 1E
1547.0-5408 was > 1e42 erg/s. This luminosity is comparable to that of the
bursts of soft gamma repeaters (SGR) and is at least two orders of magnitude
larger than the luminosity of the previously reported bursts from AXPs.
Similarly to the SGR bursts, the brightest bursts of 1E 1547.0-5408 consist of
a short spike of ~100 ms duration with a hard spectrum, followed by a softer
extended tail of 1-10 s duration, which occasionally exhibits pulsations with
the source spin period of ~2 s. The observation of AXP bursts with luminosities
comparable to the one of SGR bursts strengthens the conjecture that AXPs and
SGRs are different representatives of one and the same source type.

starting sample of 2473 quasars with zem=3.6-4.4, we analyze 469 spectra
meeting strict seletion criteria for a total redshift path Dz=93.8 and identify
192 intervening systems at z>3.3. The incidence of tau>=2 LLSs per unit
redshift, l(z), is well described by a single-power law at these redshifts:
l(z) = C_LLS [(1+z)/(1+z_*)]^gamma, with z_*=3.7, C_LLS = 1.9+/-0.2, and gamma
= 5.2+/-1.5 (68% c.l.). These values are systematically lower than previous
estimates (especially at z<4) but are consistent with recent measurements of
the mean free path to ionizing radiation. Extrapolations of this power-law to
z=0 are inconsistent with previous estimations of l(z) at z<1 and suggest a
break at z~2, similar to that observed for the Lya forest. Our results also
indicate that the systems giving rise to LLS absorption decrease by ~50% in
comoving number density and/or physical size from z=4 to 3.3, perhaps due to an
enhanced extragalactic ultraviolet background. The observations place an
integral constraint on the HI frequency distribution f(N_HI,X) and indicate
that the power-law slope beta= dln[f(N,X)]/dln[N] is likely shallower than beta
= -1 at N_HI=10^18 cm^-2. Including other constraints on f(N_HI,X) from the
literature, we infer that beta is steeper than beta = -1.7 at N_HI~10^15 cm^-2,
implying at least two inflections in f(N_HI,X). We also perform a survey for
proximate LLSs (PLLSs) and find that l(z)_PLLS is systematically lower ~25%
than intervening systems. Finally, we estimate that systematic effects impose
an uncertainty of 10-20% in the l(z) measurements; these effects may limit the
precision of all future surveys.

LLS (N_HI = 10^[18.0 +/- 0.25] cm^{-2} for b_HI >= 20 km/s) and also the N_HI
values of the velocity subsystems comprising the absorber. We measure ionic
column densities for metal-line transitions associated with the subsystems and
use these values to constrain the ionization state (>90% ionized) and relative
abundances of the gas. We find an order of magnitude dispersion in the
metallicities of the subsystems, marking the first detailed analysis of
metallicity variations in an optically thick absorber. The results indicate
that metals are not well mixed within the gas surrounding high $z$ galaxies.
Assuming a single-phase photoionization model, we also derive an N_H-weighted
metallicity, <[Si/H]> = -1.66 +/- 0.25, which matches the mean metallicity in
the neutral ISM in high z damped Lya systems (DLAs). Because the line density
of LLSs is ~10 times higher than the DLAs, we propose that the former dominate
the metal mass-density at z~3 and that these metals reside in the galaxy/IGM
interface. Considerations of a multi-phase model do not qualitatively change
these conclusions. Finally, we comment on an anomalously large O^0/Si^+ ratio
in the LLS that suggests an ionizing radiation field dominated by soft UV
sources (e.g. a starburst galaxy). Additional abundance analysis is performed

significantly larger than previous single-dish measurements. Consequently, the
HI-deficiencies for these HCGs have been reduced, although not completely
eliminated. Spectral comparison of the GBT data with complementary Very Large
Array (VLA) data shows significant HI excess in the GBT spectra. The observed
excess is primarily due to the high surface brightness sensitivity of the GBT
detecting diffuse, low column density HI in these groups. The excess gas forms
a faint diffused neutral medium which is an intermediate stage in the evolution
of high-surface brightness HI tidal debris in the intra-group medium (IGM)
before it is fully ionized. The excess gas mass fraction (ratio of excess HI to
total HI) for our complete sample varies from 5% to 81% with an average of 36%
(median=30%). The excess gas mass fraction is highest in slightly HI deficient
groups where the tidal debris has had enough time to evolve. We also find the
excess gas content increases with the evolutionary phase of the group described
in Verdes-Montenegro et al. 2001. Theoretical calculations indicate that an HI
cloud of radius >200 pc would survive in an IGM of 2 million Kelvin for more
than the typical dynamical lifetime of a group. However, smaller clouds get
evaporated and assimilated into the hot IGM in a much shorter timescale.

can extend from the star surface to the light cylinder along near the last open
field lines, the extension of the gaps along the azimuthal direction is limited

roughly coincides with the epoch of dynamical encounters of two galaxies, NGC

star clusters also shows two peaks at about 100 Myr and 250 Myr ago. The star
cluster mass ranges from 10^3 to 10^6 M_{\odot} and the mass function can be

algorithmic results exhibit a common structure. Namely, the function is
extended to a continuous, usually non-linear, function on a convex domain.
Then, this relaxation is solved, and the fractional solution rounded to yield

gauge-gravity duality, which suggested a new approach to superstring theory and
quantum space-time. In this context it is important to study supersymmetric
large-N gauge theories in the strongly coupled regime. I will summarize the
results and insights obtained so far by non-lattice simulations. A simple
example of the gauge-gravity duality is the one between 1d U(N) gauge theory
with 16 supercharges and the so-called black 0-brane solution in type IIA
supergravity. In order for this duality to be valid, one has to take the 't
Hooft large-N limit and to take the strong coupling limit on the gauge theory
side. The gauge theory can be regularized by fixing the gauge completely thanks
to one dimension, and by introducing a Fourier mode cutoff. One can then use
the standard RHMC algorithm to simulate the system. The energy calculated as a
function of the temperature was compared with the results obtained from the
gravity side based on the black hole thermodynamics. This confirmed the
gauge-gravity duality with high accuracy and provided the microscopic origin of
the black hole thermodynamics. From the calculation of the Wilson loop, one
obtains the Schwarzschild radius of the dual geometry. One can actually use the
present 1d model with supersymmetric mass deformation to study \mathcal{N}=4
super Yang-Mills theory on R \times S^3 based on a novel large-N reduction,
which generalizes the original idea of Eguchi and Kawai. It is remarkable that
we can now simulate the 4d superconformal field theory, which appears in the
most typical case of the gauge-gravity duality known as the AdS/CFT
correspondence. In particular, no fine-tuning is required unlike previous
proposals based on the lattice regularization.

sense, then the distributions of the processes on the two paths are
conditionally independent, given their values at the common endpoint of the two
paths. Conditions on graphs that support such processes (e.g., hexagonal
lattice) are established. Next we analyze a particularly suitable family of
Markov processes, called harnesses, which includes Brownian motion and other
L\'{e}vy processes, on such time-like graphs. Finally we investigate continuum
limits of harnesses on a sequence of time-like graphs that admits a limit in a
suitable sense.

constituents of the outer stellar halo in the Milky Way. Almost all of the
sample stars have an orbit reaching a maximum vertical distance (Z_max) of >5
kpc above and below the Galactic plane. High-resolution, high signal-to-noise
spectra for the sample stars obtained with Subaru/HDS are used to derive
chemical abundances of Na, Mg, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Zn, Y and Ba with an LTE
abundance analysis code. The resulting abundance data are combined with those
presented in literature that mostly targeted at smaller Z_max stars, and both
data are used to investigate any systematic trends in detailed abundance
patterns depending on their kinematics. It is shown that, in the metallicity
range of -2<[Fe/H]<-1, the [Mg/Fe] ratios for the stars with Z_max>5 kpc are
systematically lower (~0.1 dex) than those with smaller Z_max. This result of
the lower [alpha/Fe] for the assumed outer halo stars is consistent with
previous studies that found a signature of lower [alpha/Fe] ratios for stars
with extreme kinematics. A distribution of the [Mg/Fe] ratios for the outer
halo stars partly overlaps with that for stars belonging to the Milky Way dwarf
satellites in the metallicity interval of -2<[Fe/H]<-1 and spans a range
intermediate between the distributions for the inner halo stars and the stars
belonging to the satellites. Our results confirm inhomogeneous nature of
chemical abundances within the Milky Way stellar halo depending on kinematic
properties of constituent stars as suggested by earlier studies. Possible
implications for the formation of the Milky Way halo and its relevance to the
suggested dual nature of the halo are discussed.

light- and heavy-hole states of the ""one-particle system"". For 2D packets we
obtained the analytical solution for the components of wave function and
analyzed the space-time dependence of probability densities as well as angular
momentum densities. Depending on the value of the parameter $a=k_0d$ ($k_0$ is
the average momentum vector and $d$ is the packet width) two scenarios of
evolution are realized. For $a>>1$ the initial wave packet splits into two
parts and the coordinates of packet center experience the transient
oscillations or {\it Zitterbewegung} (ZB) as for other two-band systems. In the
case when $a<<1$ the distribution of probability density at $t>0$ remains
almost cylindrically symmetric and the ripples arise at the circumference of
wave packet. The ZB in this case is absent. We evaluated and visualized for
different values of parameter $a$ the space-time dependence of angular momentum
densities, which have the multipole structure. It was shown that the average
momentum components can precess in the absence of external or effective

Random Fields), combinatorial optimization on graphs, economic team theory and

conditions to guarantee average-case polynomiality of the underlying
optimization problem. We construct a new decentralized algorithm called Cavity
Expansion and establish its theoretical performance for a variety of models.
Specifically, for certain classes of models we prove that our algorithm is able
to find near optimal solutions with high probability in a decentralized way.
The success of the algorithm is based on the network exhibiting a correlation
decay (long-range independence) property. Our results have the following
surprising implications in the area of average case complexity of algorithms.
Finding the largest independent (stable) set of a graph is a well known NP-hard
optimization problem for which no polynomial time approximation scheme is
possible even for graphs with largest connectivity equal to three, unless P=NP.
We show that the closely related maximum weighted independent set problem for
the same class of graphs admits a PTAS when the weights are i.i.d. with the
exponential distribution. Namely, randomization of the reward function turns an

molecular hydrogen emission that may have been caused by shock waves from the

from the spectral energy distributions, the mass, age and luminosity of all the

out by varying the Sr and Ag contents simultaneously to achieve large
temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) as well as low field
magneto-resistance (MR) at room temperature. Sharpest paramagnetic
(PM)-ferromagnetic (FM) and insulator-metal (IM) transition is observed in the
vicinity of the room temperature (TC=300 K=TIM) for the composition
La0.70Ca0.20Sr00.10MnO3:Ag0.20. Partial substitution of larger Sr2+ ions at the
Ca2+ ions sites controls the magnitude of the FM and IM transition
temperatures, while the Ag induces the desired sharpness in these transitions.
For the optimized composition, maximum TCR and MR are tuned to room temperature
(300 K) with the former being as high as 9% and the later being 20 and 30
percent at 5 and 10 kOe magnetic fields respectively. Such sharp single peak
(TCR= 9 percent) at room temperature can be used for the bolometric and
infrared detector applications. The achievement of large TCR and low field MR
at T~300K in polycrystalline samples is encouraging and we believe that further
improvements can be achieved in thin films, which, by virtue of their low
conduction noise, are more suitable for device applications.

nonlinear effects in both Eulerian and Lagrangian frameworks, also corresponds
to the Burgers equation of hydrodynamics. Focusing on the one-dimensional case
with power-law initial conditions, we obtain exact results for Eulerian and
Lagrangian propagators. We find that Eulerian propagators can be expressed in
terms of the one-point velocity probability distribution and show a strong
decay at late times and high wavenumbers, interpreted as a ""sweeping effect""
but not a genuine damping of small-scale structures. By contrast, Lagrangian
propagators can be written in terms of the shock mass function -- which would
correspond to the halo mass function in cosmology -- and saturate to a constant
value at late times. Moreover, they show a power-law dependence on scale or
wavenumber which depends on the initial power-spectrum index and is directly
related to the low-mass tail of the shock mass function. These results strongly
suggest that Lagrangian propagators are much more sensitive probes of nonlinear
structures in the underlying density field and of relaxation processes than
their Eulerian counterparts.

parameters. When both refractive index and layer thickness of a mixed stack are
random, the transmission length in the long-wave range of the localized regime
exhibits a quadratic power wavelength dependence with the coefficients
different for mixed and homogeneous stacks. Moreover, the transmission length
of a mixed stack differs from reciprocal of the Lyapunov exponent of the
corresponding infinite stack. In both the ballistic regime of a mixed stack and
in the near long-wave region of a homogeneous stack, the transmission length of
a realization is a strongly fluctuating quantity. In the far long-wave part of
the ballistic region, the homogeneous stack becomes effectively uniform and the
transmission length fluctuations are weaker. The crossover region from the
localization to the ballistic regime is relatively narrow for both mixed and
homogeneous stacks. In mixed stacks with only refractive-index disorder,
Anderson localization at long wavelengths is substantially suppressed, with the
localization length growing with the wavelength much faster than for

clusters is extracted from the ESO Nearby Abell Cluster Survey (ENACS) catalog.
The sample of high-redshift (z ~ 0.4-0.8) clusters is mostly made of clusters
from the ESO Distant Cluster Survey (EDisCS). We determine the average
mass-profiles for these two cluster samples by solving the Jeans equation for
hydrostatic equilibrium, using galaxies as tracers. By using two cluster galaxy
populations, characterized by the presence and, respectively, absence of
emission-lines in their spectra ('ELGs' and 'nELGs' hereafter), we are able to
partially break the mass-profile orbital-anisotropy degeneracy. We find that
the mass-profiles of both the nearby and the distant clusters are reasonably
well fitted by a Navarro, Frenk and White (NFW) model. The best-fit values of
the NFW concentration parameter are as predicted by cosmological numerical
simulations; cluster mass-density profiles become more concentrated with time.
The evolution of the number-density profile of nELGs proceeds in the opposite
sense, becoming less concentrated with time. In our analysis we also recover
the orbital anisotropy of nELGs and ELGs . We find that in low-z clusters nELGs
follow almost isotropic orbits and ELGs have more radially-elongated orbits. In
high-z clusters both nELGs and ELGs follow radially-elongated orbits. We
discuss these results in terms of the predicted secular mass growth of galaxy
clusters and the transformation of ELGs into nELGs.

symmetry of the Cooper pairs, random distribution of potential drops, dirty

terms act respectively by modulating the global resistance and by changing the
Josephson coupling of the mixed superconductive-normal states. First, the
approach is applied to simulate the transition in disordered granular
superconductors with the weak-links characterized by nonsinusoidal
current-phase relation. In granular superconductors, the emergence of
higher-order harmonics affects the slope of the transition. Then, arrays of
intrinsic Josephson junctions, naturally formed by the CuO$_2$ planes in
cuprates, are considered. The critical temperature suppression, observed at
values of hole doping close to $p=1/8$, is investigated. Such suppression,
related to the sign change and modulation of the Josephson coupling across the
array, is quantified in terms of the intensities of the first and second
sinusoids of the current-phase relation. Applications are envisaged for the
design and control of quantum devices based on stacks of intrinsic Josephson

light flavours, to the third order in perturbative QCD. The two-loop results
are employed to construct the next-to-next-to-leading order physical evolution
kernels for the system (F_2 F_phi) of flavour-singlet structure functions. The
practical relevance of these kernels as an alternative to MSbar factorization
is bedevilled by artificial double logarithms at small values of the scaling
variable x, where the large top-mass limit ceases to be appropriate. However,
they show an only single-logarithmic enhancement at large x. Conjecturing that
this feature persists to the next order also in the present singlet case, the
three-loop coefficient functions facilitate exact predictions (backed up by
their particular colour structure) of the double-logarithmic contributions to
the fourth-order singlet splitting functions, i.e., of the terms (1-x)^a
ln^k(1-x) with k = 4, 5, 6 and k = 3, 4, 5, respectively, for the off-diagonal

a model allows us to compute reliably the number of high redshift objects as a
function of luminosity, and yields galaxies whose UV luminosities closely match

is remarkably good considering our admittedly still simple modelling of the
interstellar medium (ISM) physics. The luminosity functions (LF) of virtual UV
luminous galaxies coincide with the existing data over the whole redshift range

for O-type stars (as shown by a comparison with the O9 star HD155889 in the

putative dense equatorial regions at the origin of the Oe classification.

random scattering by a 2D mesoscopic open ballistic structure. A new mechanism
of decoherence is proposed. The temperature of the environment is supposed to
be zero whereas the energy of the incoming particle $E_{in}$ can be close to or
somewhat above the Fermi surface in the environment. The single-particle
doorway resonance states excited in the structure via external channels are
damped not only because of escape through such channels but also due to the
ulterior population of the long-lived environmental states. Transmission of an
electron with a given incoming $E_{in}$ through the structure turns out to be
an incoherent sum of the flow formed by the interfering damped doorway
resonances and the retarded flow of the particles re-emitted into the structure
by the environment. Though the number of the particles is conserved in each
individual event of transmission, there exists a probability that some part of
the electron's energy can be absorbed due to environmental many-body effects.
In such a case the electron can disappear from the resonance energy interval
and elude observation at the fixed transmission energy $E_{in}$ thus resulting
in seeming loss of particles, violation of the time reversal symmetry and, as a
consequence, suppression of the weak localization. The both decoherence and
absorption phenomena are treated within the framework of a unit microscopic
model based on the general theory of the resonance scattering. All the effects
discussed are controlled by the only parameter: the spreading width of the
doorway resonances, that uniquely determines the decoherence rate

sources instead of the expected 0.61 sources at a significance of 2 sigma or

to be 3.8 x 10^-6. If the excess distribution observed by the Tibet-III array
has a density gradient toward the Galactic plane, the expected number of
sources may be enhanced in chance association. Then, the chance probability
rises slightly, to 1.2 x 10^-5, based on a simple Monte Carlo simulation. These
low chance probabilities clearly show that the Fermi bright Galactic sources
have statistically significant correlations with TeV gamma-ray excesses. We
also find that all 7 sources are associated with pulsars, and 6 of them are
coincident with sources detected by the Milagro experiment at a significance of
3 sigma or more at the representative energy of 35 TeV. The significance maps
observed by the Tibet-III air shower array around the Fermi sources, which are

10^{-9} and 10^{-6}, respectively. The inflaton is unstable with the lifetime
10^{-9}--10^{-10} s. The inflaton decays can be searched for in a beam-target

several tenths of millions inflatons can be produced per year with modern

Tc and the largest anisotropy and Fe1+y(Te1-x,Sex), with the largest Hc2, the
lowest Tc and the lowest anisotropy. In the case of the SmFeAs(O1-xFx) series,
we find that a single band description allows to extract an approximated
estimation of band parameters such as carrier density and mobility from
experimental data, although the behaviour of Seebeck effect as a function of
doping demonstrates that a multiband description would be more appropriate. On
the contrary, experimental data of the Fe1+y(Te1-x,Sex) series exhibit a
strongly compensated behaviour, which can be described only within a multiband
model. In the Fe1+y(Te1-x,Sex) series, the role of the excess Fe, tuned by Se
stoichiometry, is found to be twofold: it dopes electrons in the system and it
introduces localized magnetic moments, responsible for Kondo like scattering
and likely pair-breaking of Cooper pairs. Hence, excess Fe plays a crucial role
also in determining superconducting properties such as the Tc and the upper
critical field Bc2. The huge Bc2 values of the Fe1+y(Te1-x,Sex) samples are
described by a dirty limit law, opposed to the clean limit behaviour of the
SmFeAs(O1-xFx) samples. Hence, magnetic scattering by excess Fe seems to drive
the system in the dirty regime, but its detrimental pairbreaking role seems not
to be as severe as predicted by theory. This issue has yet to be clarified,
addressing the more fundamental issue of the interplay between magnetism and
superconductivity.

acceleration region dominates the impulsive phase and the thin-target emission
from the acceleration region dominates the low-energy thermal component in the
gradual phase, as observed in early impulsive flares. Quantitative details
depend on properties of the thermal background, which leads to variations in
the correlation between HXR flux and spectral index. For lower temperature
and/or higher density of the background electrons, the HXRs both rise and decay
more quickly with a plateau near the peak. The plateau is less prominent at
higher energies. Given the complexity of transport of mass, momentum, and
energy along loops in the impulsive phase, we propose a strategy to apply this
single-zone energy release and electron acceleration model to observations of
flares associated with single loops so that the energy release, electron
acceleration, and evaporation processes may be studied quantitatively.

test a suite of publicly available evolutionary synthesis models using
integrated optical spectra in the blue-near-UV range of 27 well studied star
clusters from the work of Leonardi & Rose (2003) spanning a wide range of ages
and metallicities. Most (23) of the clusters are from the Magellanic clouds.
This paper concentrates on methodological aspects of spectral fitting. The data
are fitted with SSP spectral models from Vazdekis and collaborators, based on
the MILES library. Best-fit and Bayesian estimates of age, metallicity and
extinction are presented, and degeneracies between these parameters are mapped.
We find that these models can match the observed spectra very well in most
cases, with small formal uncertainties in t, Z and A_V. In some cases, the
spectral fits indicate that the models lack a blue old population, probably
associated with the horizontal branch. This methodology, which is mostly based
on the publicly available code STARLIGHT, is extended to other sets of models

data (color-magnitude diagrams) is presented. The global aim of these two
papers is to provide guidance to users of evolutionary synthesis models and
empirical feedback to model makers.

treatment of multi-scalar fields for which (as in a nonlinear sigma model) the

Their application is extended from ordinary harmonic models to a more general
category of ""harmonious"" field models, with emphasis on cases in which the
field is confined to a string or higher brane worldsheet, and for which the
relevant internal symmetry group is non Abelian, so that the conditions for
conservation of the corresponding charge currents become rather delicate,
particularly when the symmetry is gauged. Attention is also given to the
conditions for conservation of currents of a different kind -- representing
surface fluxes of generalised momentum or energy -- associated with symmetries
not of the internal target space but of the underlying spacetime background
structure, including the metric and any relevant gauge field. For the
corresponding current to be conserved the latter need not be manifestly
invariant: preservation modulo a gauge adjustment will suffice. The simplest
case is that of ""strong"" symmetry, meaning invariance under the action of an
effective Lie derivative (an appropriately gauge adjusted modification of an
ordinary Lie derivative). When the effective symmetry is of the more general
""weak"" kind, the kinetic part of the current is not conserved by itself but
only after being supplemented by a suitable contribution from the background.

traveling-wave tube), and the introducing of the second delayed feedback is a
natural measure for dealing with stray effects brought about by the inherent
one. Specifically, for the Lorenz system we show that two incommensurable delay

with weak Josephson coupling. Analytical expressions of atom-number squeezing
and bipartite entanglement are presented for atom-atom repulsive interactions.
For attractive interactions, there is no number squeezing; however, the
squeezing parameter is still useful to recognize the appearance of
Schr\""{o}dinger's cat state.

derived from the Bagger-Lambert model. It is a 6 dimensional supersymmetric
self-dual gauge theory describing an M5-brane in a large constant $C$-field
background. The non-Abelian gauge symmetry corresponds to diffeomorphisms
preserving an exact 3-form on the worldvolume, which defines a Nambu-Poisson
bracket. Various interesting geometric and algebraic properties of the theory
are discussed.

"0912.0446","Marc Manera","Marc Manera and Enrique Gaztanaga","The Local Bias Model in the Large Scale Halo Distribution","Accepted in MNRAS. Compared to first version, the paper has been
  completely reorganised. New figures and content added",,"10.1111/j.1365-2966.2011.18705.x",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We explore the biasing in the clustering statistics of halos as compared to
dark matter (DM) in simulations. We look at the second and third order
statistics at large scales of the (intermediate) MICEL1536 simulation and also
measure directly the local bias relation h = f({\delta}) between DM
fluctuations, {\delta}, smoothed over a top-hat radius Rs at a point in the
simulation and its corresponding tracer h (i.e. halos) at the same point. This
local relation can be Taylor expanded to define a linear (b1) and non-linear
(b2) bias parameters. The values of b1 and b2 in the simulation vary with Rs
approaching a constant value around Rs > 30 - 60 Mpc/h. We use the local
relation to predict the clustering of the tracer in terms of the one of DM.
This prediction works very well (about percent level) for the halo 2-point
correlation {\xi}(r_12) for r_12 > 15 Mpc/h, but only when we use the biasing
values that we found at very large smoothing radius Rs > 30 - 60 Mpc/h. We find
no effect from stochastic or next to leading order terms in the f({\delta})
expansion. But we do find some discrepancies in the 3-point function that needs
further understanding. We also look at the clustering of the smoothed moments,
the variance and skewness which are volume average correlations and therefore
include clustering from smaller scales. In this case, we find that both next to
leading order and discreetness corrections (to the local model) are needed at
the 10 - 20% level. Shot-noise can be corrected with a term {\sigma}e^2/n where
{\sigma}e^2 < 1, i.e., always smaller than the Poisson correction. We also
compare these results with the peak-background split predictions from the
measured halo mass function. We find 5-10% systematic (and similar statistical)
errors in the mass estimation when we use the halo model biasing predictions to
calibrate the mass.

harmonic maps from a Riemannian manifold into a Euclidean sphere under the
assumption that the image avoids some neighborhood of a half-equator. The
proofs combine constructions of strictly convex functions and the regularity
theory of quasi-linear elliptic systems.
  We apply these results to the spherical and Euclidean Bernstein problems for
minimal hypersurfaces, obtaining new conditions under which compact minimal
hypersurfaces in spheres or complete minimal hypersurfaces in Euclidean spaces
are trivial.

a game, an idea that has been successively applied to several classes of games.
