described in the cryptographically fashionable term of ""factoring with hints"":
we show that, given the knowledge of the factorisations of
$O(N^{1/3+\epsilon})$ terms surrounding $N=pq$ product of two large primes, we
can recover deterministically $p$ and $q$ in $O(N^{1/3+\epsilon})$ bit
operations. Although this is slower than the current best factoring algorithms,
this method shows that the factorisations of close integers are related and
that consequently one can expect more results along this line of thought.

translocating polymer of length $N$ in two dimensions, in the absence of
external forces on the polymer (i.e., unbiased translocation) and hydrodynamic
interactions (i.e., the polymer is a Rouse polymer), through a narrow pore.
Earlier studies using the BFM concluded that the pore-blockade time scales with
polymer length as $\tau_d \sim N^\beta$, with $\beta=1+2\nu$, whereas some
recent studies with different polymer models produce results consistent with
$\beta=2+\nu$, originally predicted by us. Here $\nu$ is the Flory exponent of
the polymer; $\nu=0.75$ in 2D. In this paper we show that for the BFM if the
simulations are extended to longer polymers, the purported scaling $\tau_d \sim
N^{1+2\nu}$ ceases to hold. We characterize the finite-size effects, and study
the mobility of individual monomers in the BFM. In particular, we find that in
the BFM, in the vicinity of the pore the individual monomeric mobilities are
heavily suppressed in the direction perpendicular to the membrane. After a
modification of the BFM which counters this suppression (but possibly
introduces other artifacts in the dynamics), the apparent exponent $\beta$
increases significantly. Our conclusion is that BFM simulations do not rule out
our theoretical prediction for unbiased translocation, namely $\beta=2+\nu$.

outperforms optimal linear deconvolution (Wiener filtering) on both simulated

inference can be performed on the set of all observed traces faster than
real-time. Performing optimal spatial filtering on the images further refines
the estimates. Importantly, all the parameters required to perform the

smaller than the data. In the S2 scenario, although the central value for the

branching fractions from the hadronic input parameters. The CP asymmetry in the

accurate data in near future from the various $B$ factories, these predictions
will be under stringent tests.

poles that produce a large enhancement of the growth rate. Alternatively, we
match the functions at a single point and show that, despite the uncertainty in

which a lepton asymmetry is established in the out-of-equilibrium decays of the
next-to-lightest right-handed neutrino. We apply the full classical Boltzmann
equations without the assumption of kinetic equilibrium and including all
quantum statistical factors to calculate the wash-out of the lepton asymmetry
by interactions of the lightest right-handed state. We include scattering
processes with top quarks in our analysis. This is of particular interest since
the wash-out is enhanced by scatterings and the use of mode equations with
quantum statistical distribution functions. In this way we provide a
restriction on the parameter space for this scenarios.

out using red early type galaxies. For a given luminosity, $\mu_R$ of field
galaxies is bluer and $\sigma_R$ is larger than their group and cluster
counterparts irrespective of mass and position within the systems. Among
systems of galaxies, high mass groups and clusters have the reddest $\mu_R$ and
the smallest $\sigma_R$. These differences almost disappear when red early type
galaxies alone are considered. Galaxies in the core and in the outskirts of
groups have similar $\mu_R$, whereas galaxies in clusters show a strong
dependence on cluster centric distance. Red early type galaxies in the

galaxies in the inner regions of clusters have lower values. We find that
bright red early type galaxies have reached nearly the same evolutionary stage

necessary to populate the RS. We propose a scenario in which the RS in massive
systems is populated by two different star formation history galaxies: red
early type galaxies that formed the bulk of their stars during the early stages

inhabiting poor groups or the field and fell into massive systems at lower

considering the case of beta >= 1 in the post-shock region. In these cases the
1D approximation is not valid and a multi-dimensional MHD approach is
necessary.
  METHODS. We model an accretion stream propagating through the atmosphere of a
CTTS and impacting onto its chromosphere, by performing 2D axisymmetric MHD
simulations. The model takes into account the stellar magnetic field, the
gravity, the radiative cooling, and the thermal conduction (including the
effects of heat flux saturation).
  RESULTS. The dynamics and stability of the accretion shock strongly depends
on the plasma beta. In the case of shocks with beta > 10, violent outflows of
shock-heated material (and possibly MHD waves) are generated at the base of the
accretion column and strongly perturb the surrounding stellar atmosphere and
the accretion column itself (modifying, therefore, the dynamics of the shock).
In shocks with beta ~ 1, the post-shock region is efficiently confined by the
magnetic field. The shock oscillations induced by cooling instability are
strongly influenced by beta: for beta > 10, the oscillations may be rapidly
dumped by the magnetic field, approaching a quasi-stationary state, or may be
chaotic with no obvious periodicity due to perturbation of the stream induced
by the post-shock plasma itself; for beta ~ 1 the oscillations are
quasi-periodic, although their amplitude is smaller and the frequency higher
than those predicted by 1D models.

for the elimination of degeneracy are found and the issue of influence of
relaxation time of constant external field to the target state are addressed
through the fidelity. Another approach is to control the degenerate system by a
single control field directly. It is found that the system with two-fold

Fe-peak elements. We have compiled from the literature a database of carefully
determined solar neighborhood stellar abundances of seven iron-peak elements,
Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni and then plotted [X/Fe] versus [Fe/H] to study
the trends as functions of metallicity. Chemical evolution models were then
employed to force a fit to the observed trends by adjusting the input massive
star metallicity-sensitive yields of Kobayashi et al. Our results suggest that
yields of Ti, V, and Co are generally larger as well as anticorrelated with
metallicity, in contrast to the Kobayashi et al. predictions. We also find the
yields of Cr and Mn to be generally smaller and directly correlated with
metallicity compared to the theoretical results. Our results for Ni are
consistent with theory, although our model suggests that all Ni yields should
be scaled up slightly. The outcome of this exercise is the computation of a set
of integrated yields, i.e., stellar yields weighted by a slightly flattened
time-independent Salpeter initial mass function and integrated over stellar
mass, for each of the above elements at several metallicity points spanned by
the broad range of observations. These results are designed to be used as
empirical constraints on future iron-peak yield predictions by stellar
evolution modelers. Special attention is paid to the interesting behavior of
[Cr/Co] with metallicity -- these two elements have opposite slopes -- as well
as the indirect correlation of [Ti/Fe] with [Fe/H]. These particular trends, as
well as those exhibited by the inferred integrated yields of all iron-peak
elements with metallicity, are discussed in terms of both supernova
nucleosynthesis and atomic physics.

a clear geometric interpretation and are a first step towards obtaining

order dynamics into account the symmetries of the action are broken. This
results in consistency conditions on the background gauge parameters arising
from the lowest non--linear equations of motion. In the canonical framework the
constraints to quadratic order turn out to depend on the background gauge
parameters and are therefore pseudo constraints. These considerations are
important for connecting path integral and canonical quantizations of gravity,

that a special class of states exists where the viscous heating and the

differing from the Navier--Stokes one. In addition, a heat flux component

90"" x 90"" region around l = 34.69, b = -0.65, using the Atacama Submillimeter
Telescope Experiment (ASTE) in the 12CO J=3-2, 13CO J=3-2, HCO+ J=4-3 and CS
J=7-6 lines with an angular resolution of 22"". The infrared emission in the
area has been analyzed using 2MASS and Spitzer public data. From the molecular
analysis, we find self-absorbed 12CO J=3-2 profiles, which are typical in star
forming regions, but we do not find any evidence of outflow activity. Moreover,
we do not detect either HCO+ J=4-3 or CS J=7-6 in the region, which are species
normally enhanced in molecular outflows and high density envelopes. The 12CO
J=3-2 emission profile suggests the presence of expanding gas in the region.
The Spitzer images reveal that the infrared source has a conspicuous extended
emission bright at 8 um with an evident shell-like morphology of ~ 1.5 arcmin
in size (~ 1.4 pc at the proposed distance of 3 kpc) that encircles the 24 um
emission. The non-detection of ionized gas related to IRAS 18544+0112, together
with the fact that it is still embedded in a molecular clump suggest that IRAS
18544+0112, has not reached the UCHII region stage yet. Based on near infrared
photometry we search for YSO candidates in the region and propos that 2MASS
18565878+0116233 is the infrared point source associated with IRAS 18544+0112.
Finally, we suggest that the expansion of a larger nearby HII region,
G034.8-0.7, might be related to the formation of IRAS 18544+0112.

study of coherent imaging systems, such as synthetic aperture radar and sonar,
and ultrasound and laser imaging. These models introduce two additional layers
of difficulties with respect to the standard Gaussian additive noise scenario:
(1) the noise is multiplied by (rather than added to) the original image; (2)
the noise is not Gaussian, with Rayleigh and Gamma being commonly used
densities. These two features of multiplicative noise models preclude the
direct application of most state-of-the-art algorithms, which are designed for
solving unconstrained optimization problems where the objective has two terms:
a quadratic data term (log-likelihood), reflecting the additive and Gaussian
nature of the noise, plus a convex (possibly nonsmooth) regularizer (e.g., a
total variation or wavelet-based regularizer/prior). In this paper, we address
these difficulties by: (1) converting the multiplicative model into an additive
one by taking logarithms, as proposed by some other authors; (2) using variable
splitting to obtain an equivalent constrained problem; and (3) dealing with
this optimization problem using the augmented Lagrangian framework. A set of
experiments shows that the proposed method, which we name MIDAL (multiplicative
image denoising by augmented Lagrangian), yields state-of-the-art results both

by orders of magnitude despite inter-atomic repulsion. Crucially, the focusing
dynamics are insensitive to quantum fluctuations of the atom cloud and largely
preserve the condensates' coherence, suggesting applications in passive
atom-optical elements, for example zone plate lenses that focus atomic matter
waves and light at the same point to strengthen their interaction. We explore
transmission zone-plate focusing of alkali atoms as a route to erasable and
scalable lithography of quantum electronic components in two-dimensional
electron gases embedded in semiconductor nanostructures. To do this, we
calculate the density profile of a two-dimensional electron gas immediately
below a patch of alkali atoms deposited on the surface of the nanostructure by
zone-plate focusing. Our results reveal that surface-induced polarization of
only a few thousand adsorbed atoms can locally deplete the electron gas. We
show that, as a result, the focused deposition of alkali atoms by existing zone
plates can create quantum electronic components on the 50 nm scale, comparable
to that attainable by ion beam implantation but with minimal damage to either

simulations including magnetic fields, anisotropic thermal conduction, and
radiative cooling. The imposed ""stirring"" crudely approximates the effects of
galactic wakes, waves generated by galaxies moving through the intracluster
medium (ICM), and/or turbulence produced by a central active galactic nucleus.
The simulated clusters exhibit a strong bimodality. Modest levels of
turbulence, ~100 km/s (~10% of the sound speed), suppress the heat-flux-driven
buoyancy instability (HBI), resulting in an isotropically tangled magnetic
field and a quasi-stable, high entropy, thermal equilibrium with no cooling
catastrophe. Thermal conduction dominates the heating of the cluster core, but
turbulent mixing is critical because it suppresses the HBI and (to a lesser
extent) the thermal instability. Lower levels of turbulent mixing
(approximately less than 100 km/s) are insufficient to suppress the HBI,
rapidly leading to a thermal runaway and a cool-core cluster. Remarkably, then,
small fluctuations in the level of turbulence in galaxy cluster cores can
initiate transitions between cool-core (low entropy) and non cool-core (high
entropy) states.

mass. We find that satellites are older and metal-richer than centrals of the
same stellar mass. In addition, the slopes of the age-stellar mass and
metallicity-stellar mass relations are found to become shallower in denser
environments. This is due to the fact that the average age and metallicity of
low mass satellite galaxies increase with the mass of the halo in which they
reside. A comparison with the semi-analytical model of Wang et al. (2008) shows
that it succesfully reproduces the fact that satellites are older than centrals
of the same stellar mass and that the age difference increases with the halo
mass of the satellite. This is a consequence of strangulation, which leaves the
stellar populations of satellites to evolve passively, while the prolonged star
formation activity of centrals keeps their average ages younger. The resulting
age offset is larger in more massive environments because their satellites were
accreted earlier. The model fails, however, in reproducing the halo mass
dependence of the metallicities of low mass satellites, yields
metallicity-stellar mass and age-stellar mass relations that are too shallow,
and predicts that satellite galaxies have the same metallicities as centrals of
the same stellar mass, in disagreement with the data. We argue that these
discrepancies are likely to indicate the need to (i) modify the recipes of both
supernova feedback and AGN feedback, (ii) use a more realistic description of

efficiencies, we present a very simple model for star-forming galaxies (SFGs)
that accounts for the mass and redshift dependencies of the SFR-Mass and
Tully-Fisher relations from z=2 to the present. The time evolution follows from
the fact that each modelled galaxy approaches a steady state where the SFR
follows the (net) cold gas accretion rate. The key feature of the model is a
halo mass floor M_{min}~10^{11} below which accretion is quenched in order to
simultaneously account for the observed slopes of the SFR-Mass and
Tully-Fischer relations. The same successes cannot be achieved via a
star-formation threshold (or delay) nor by varying the SF efficiency or the
feedback efficiency. Combined with the mass ceiling for cold accretion due to
virial shock heating, the mass floor M_{min} explains galaxy ""downsizing"",
where more massive galaxies formed earlier and over a shorter period of time.
It turns out that the model also accounts for the observed galactic baryon and
gas fractions as a function of mass and time, and the cosmic SFR density from
z~6 to z=0, which are all resulting from the mass floor M_{min}. The model
helps to understand that it is the cosmological decline of accretion rate that
drives the decrease of cosmic SFR density between z~2 and z=0 and the rise of
the cosmic SFR density allows us to put a constraint on our main parameter
M_{min}~10^{11} solar masses. Among the physical mechanisms that could be
responsible for the mass floor, we view that photo-ionization feedback (from
first in-situ hot stars) lowering the cooling efficiency is likely to play a
large role.

quadratic or even cubic correlation between the X-ray and gamma-ray emission. A
standard model of the synchrotron self-Compton emission of a compact source
inside a jet is not able to explain such a correlation. Therefore, we propose
an alternative scenario where the emission of at least two independent compact
components is observed at the same time.
  We compare two different models. The first model assumes the injection of
relativistic particles into a downstream region of a shock wave inside a jet
that creates the emitting source. The model precisely describes the evolution
of the particle energy spectrum inside the source and takes into account a
light-crossing time effect for the produced radiation. The second model assumes
an intrinsically constant emission of a homogeneous source that travels inside
the jet along a curved trajectory, where the activity is produced simply by
different values of the source's Doppler factor. To verify the two models we
use recentlu published observations of Mrk 421.
  Our simulations show that simultaneous radiation of at least two independent
sources, where the first source dominates the emission in the X-ray range and
the second source radiates strongly in the gamma-ray range, can explain the
observed correlations. However, the injection model provides inadequate results
because it gives different values for the correlation of the rise and decay of
a flare. This problem is negligible in the scenario that uses the Doppler
boosting effect. Therefore, this approach yields much better results.

In the absence of radiation, quantum effects near the horizon do not change the
classical conclusions for an infalling observer, meaning that the horizon is
not an obstacle for him/her. The most interesting quantum mechanical effect
comes in when investigating near the origin. First, quantum effects are able to
remove the classical singularity at the origin, since the wave function is
non-singular at the origin. Second, the Schr\""odinger equation describing the
behavior near the origin displays non-local effects, which depend on the energy
density of the domain wall. This is manifest in that derivatives of the
wavefunction at one point are related to the value of the wavefunction at some

enough to have escaped detection in star-count surveys. The overall count of
stealth galaxies is sensitive to the presence (or lack) of a low-mass threshold
in galaxy formation. These systems have luminosities and stellar velocity
dispersions that are similar to those of known ultrafaint dwarf galaxies but
they have more extended stellar distributions (half light radii greater than
about 100 pc) because they inhabit dark subhalos that are slightly less massive
than their higher surface brightness counterparts. As a result, the typical
peak surface brightness is fainter than 30 mag per square arcsec. One
implication is that the inferred common mass scale for Milky Way dwarfs may be
an artifact of selection bias. If there is no sharp threshold in galaxy
formation at low halo mass, then ultrafaint galaxies like Segue 1 represent the
high-mass, early forming tail of a much larger population of objects that could

if we impose a low-mass threshold in galaxy formation in order to explain the
unexpectedly high densities of the ultrafaint dwarfs, then we expect only a

called {\it systems of Hess--Appel'rot type} that generalizes the classical

interesting combination of both integrable and non-integrable properties.
Further, following integrable line, we study partial reductions and systems
having what we call the {\it Zhukovskii property}: these are Hamiltonian
systems with invariant relations, such that partially reduced systems are
completely integrable. We prove that the Zhukovskii property is a quite general
characteristic of systems of Hess-Appel'rote type. The partial reduction
neglects the most interesting and challenging part of the dynamics of the
systems of Hess-Appel'rot type - the non-integrable part, some analysis of
which may be seen as a reconstruction problem. We show that an integrable
system, the magnetic pendulum on the oriented Grassmannian $Gr^+(4,2)$ has
natural interpretation within Zhukovskii property and it is equivalent to a
partial reduction of certain system of Hess-Appel'rot type. We perform a
classical and an algebro-geometric integration of the system, as an example of
an isoholomorphic system. The paper presents a lot of examples of systems of
Hess-Appel'rot type, giving an additional argument in favor of further study of
this class of systems.

baryonic outflow. The possible outflow acceleration in the transparent stage,
which lowers thermal radiation efficiency, has been taken into account. In the
standard internal shock model for the prompt emission, the fast shells should
move with a typical Lorentz factor $\gtrsim 5 \Gamma_{\rm i}$ otherwise the GRB
efficiency will be in disagreement with the observations, where $\Gamma_{\rm
i}$ is the bulk Lorentz factor of the shocked/emitting region. The photosphere
radius of these fast shells is small and the thermal radiation is too strong to
be effectively outshone by the internal shock emission. This is particularly
the case for some extremely bright events having $\Gamma_{\rm i} \sim 10^{3}$,
like GRBs 080319B and 080916C. The absence of a distinct thermal component in
the spectrum of most GRBs challenges the standard internal shock model and may
suggest a non-baryonic (magnetic) outflow component. Though the magnetic
outflow model seems favored by more and more data, it can hardly reproduce the
typical GRB spectrum. In the photosphere-gradual magnetic dissipation scenario,
the spectrum cuts off at $\sim 1$ GeV, too low to account for the observations
of GRBs 080916C. In the sudden magnetic energy dissipation model, the low
energy spectrum is expected to be $F_\nu \propto \nu^{-1/2}$, too soft to be
consistent with the data $F_\nu \propto \nu^{0}$. We speculate that the low
energy spectrum puzzle could be unveiled by the mechanism that particles, in
the magnetic dissipation process, are repeatedly accelerated.

phase curves to be adequately described by a linear model, for slopes of
0.04-0.09 mag/deg with average uncertainty less than 0.02 mag/deg. (The one
exception, 51378 (2001 AT33), has a formally negative slope of -0.02 +- 0.01
mag/deg.) These slopes are too steep for the opposition surge mechanism to be
shadow hiding (SH), so we conclude that the dominant surge mechanism must be
coherent backscattering (CB). In a detailed comparison of surface properties
(including surge slope, B-R color, and albedo), we find that the Trojans have
surface properties similar to the P and C class asteroids prominent in the
outer main belt, yet they have significantly different surge properties (at a
confidence level of 99.90%). This provides an imperfect argument against the
traditional idea that the Trojans were formed around Jupiter's orbit. We also
find no overlap in Trojan properties with either the main belt asteroids or
with the small icy bodies in the outer Solar System. Importantly, we find that
the Trojans are indistinguishable from other small bodies in the outer Solar
System that have lost their surface ices (such as the gray Centaurs, gray
Scattered Disk Objects, and dead comets). Thus, we find strong support for the
idea that the Trojans originally formed as icy bodies in the outer Solar
System, were captured into their current orbits during the migration of the gas
giant planets, and subsequently lost all their surface ices.

our Galaxy, using the method of Galactic parallax suggested by Eyre & Binney
(2009). We find that the uncertainty in Galactic parallax is dependent upon the
specific geometry of the problem in question. In the case of the tidal stream
GD-1, the problem geometry indicates that available proper motion data, with
individual accuracy ~4 mas/yr, should allow estimation of its distance with
about 50 percent uncertainty. Proper motions accurate to ~1 mas/yr, which are
expected from the forthcoming Pan-STARRS PS-1 survey, will allow estimation of
its distance to about 10 percent uncertainty. Proper motions from the future
LSST and Gaia projects will be more accurate still, and will allow the parallax
for a stream 30 kpc distant to be measured with ~14 percent uncertainty.
  We demonstrate the feasibility of the method and show that our uncertainty
estimates are accurate by computing Galactic parallax using simulated data for
the GD-1 stream. We also apply the method to actual data for the GD-1 stream,
published by Koposov et al. (2009). With the exception of one datum, the
distances estimated using Galactic parallax match photometric estimates with
less than 1 kpc discrepancy. The scatter in the distances recovered using
Galactic parallax is very low, suggesting that the proper motion uncertainty
reported by Koposov et al. (2009) is in fact over-estimated.
  We conclude that the GD-1 stream is (8 +/- 1) kpc distant, on a retrograde
orbit inclined 37 deg to the plane, and that the visible portion of the stream
is likely to be near pericentre.

generating functions for a variety of graphical enumeration problems. The main
results are to prove that these generating functions are in fact specific
rational functions of a distinguished irrational (algebraic) function of the
generating function parameters. This distinguished function is itself the
generating function for the Catalan numbers (or generalized Catalan numbers,
depending on the choice of parameter). It is also a solution of the inviscid
Burgers equation for certain initial data. The shock formation, or caustic, of
the Burgers characteristic solution is directly related to the poles of the
rational forms of the generating functions.
  These results in turn provide new information about the asymptotics of
recurrence coefficients for orthogonal polynomials with respect to exponential
weights. One gains new insights into the relation between certain derivatives
of the genus expansion and the asymptotic expansion of the first Painleve
transcendent, related to the double-scaling limit. This work provides a precise
expression of the Painleve asymptotic coefficients directly in terms of the
coefficients of the partial fractions expansion of the rational form of the
generating functions established here. Moreover, these insights point toward a
more general program relating the first Painleve hierarchy and the higher order
structure of the double-scaling limit to the specific rational structure of
generating functions.

nonzero eccentricities at short heliocentric periods, can generate internal
heating far in excess of the conditions observed in our own solar system.
Secular perturbations or a notional 2:1 resonance between a Hot Earth and Hot
Jupiter can be used as a baseline to consider the thermal evolution of
convecting bodies subject to strong viscoelastic tidal heating. We compare
results first from simple models using a fixed Quality factor and Love number,
and then for three different viscoelastic rheologies: the Maxwell body, the
Standard Anelastic Solid, and the Burgers body. The SAS and Burgers models are
shown to alter the potential for extreme tidal heating by introducing the
possibility of new equilibria and multiple response peaks. We find that tidal
heating tends to exceed radionuclide heating at periods below 10-30 days, and
exceed insolation only below 1-2 days. Extreme cases produce enough tidal heat
to initiate global-scale partial melting, and an analysis of tidal limiting
mechanisms such as advective cooling for earthlike planets is discussed. To
explore long term behaviors, we map equilibria points between convective heat
loss and tidal heat input as functions of eccentricity. For the periods and
magnitudes discussed, we show that tidal heating, if significant, is generally
detrimental to the width of habitable zones.

Y-Codes are used to improve the diversity gain by pairing the subchannels,
prior to SVD precoding. In particular, the subchannels with good diversity are
paired with those having low diversity gains. Hence, a pair of channels is
jointly encoded using a $2 \times 2$ real matrix, which is fixed {\em a priori}
and does not change with each channel realization. For X-Codes these matrices
are 2-dimensional rotation matrices parameterized by a single angle, while for
Y-Codes, these matrices are 2-dimensional upper left triangular matrices. The
complexity of the maximum likelihood decoding (MLD) for both X- and Y-Codes is
low. Specifically, the decoding complexity of Y-Codes is the same as that of a
scalar channel. Moreover, we propose X-, Y-Precoders with the same structure as
X-, Y-Codes, but the encoding matrices adapt to each channel realization. The
optimal encoding matrices for X-, Y-Codes/Precoders are derived analytically.
Finally, it is observed that X-Codes/Precoders perform better for
well-conditioned channels, while Y-Codes/Precoders perform better for
ill-conditioned channels, when compared to other precoding schemes in the
literature.

by the local density inhomogeneities is different from the special relativity
kinematic quadrupole. If the observer inhabits a strong inhomogeneous region,
the local quadrupole should not be neglected. We calculate such local

The quantity S, which is used to estimate the alignment between the quadrupole

stays almost constant up to 13 microns, and a more extended one that is
over-resolved even with the shortest baselines. Using the radiative transfer

robust traits in complex systems that requires two basic conditions to be
satisfied: 1) agents are versatile enough to perform more than one single
functional role within a system and 2) agents are degenerate, i.e. there exists
partial overlap in the functional capabilities of agents. Given these
prerequisites, degenerate systems can readily produce a distributed systemic
response to local perturbations. Reciprocally, excess resources related to a
single function can indirectly support multiple unrelated functions within a
degenerate system. In models of genome:proteome mappings for which distributed
decision-making and modularity of genetic functions are assumed, we verify that
such distributed compensatory effects cause enhanced robustness of system
traits. The conditions needed to achieve the networked buffering behavior are
not demanding or rare, leading us to conjecture that degeneracy may
fundamentally underpin distributed robustness within several biological
systems. We further argue that degenerate forms of distributed robustness may
readily arise in other disciplines. For instance, it may allow for new insights
into systems engineering and planning activities that occur under high
uncertainty. We also speculate that the proposed hypothesis helps to explain
recent developments in understanding the origins of resilience within complex
ecosystems.

extension of the standard geometric Brownian motion as a test equation and
consider a scalar linear test equation with several multiplicative noise terms.
This test equation allows to begin investigating the influence of
multi-dimensional noise on the stability behaviour of the methods while the
analysis is still tractable. Our findings include: (i) the stability condition
for the Theta-Milstein method and thus, for some choices of Theta, the
conditions on the step-size, are much more restrictive than those for the
Theta-Maruyama method; (ii) the precise stability region of the Theta-Milstein
method explicitly depends on the noise terms. Further, we investigate the
effect of introducing partially implicitness in the diffusion approximation
terms of Milstein-type methods, thus obtaining the possibility to control the
stability properties of these methods with a further method parameter Sigma.
Numerical examples illustrate the results and provide a comparison of the
stability behaviour of the different methods.

development of nonhydrostatic ocean models on unstructured meshes. We introduce
a new multigrid preconditioner for the Poisson problem which can be used with
finite element discretisations on general unstructured meshes; this
preconditioner is motivated by the fact that the Poisson problem has a
condition number which is independent of aspect ratio when Dirichlet boundary
conditions are imposed on the top surface of the domain. This leads to the
first level in an algebraic multigrid solver (which can be extended by further
conventional algebraic multigrid stages), and an additive smoother. We
illustrate the method with numerical tests on unstructured meshes, which show
that the preconditioner makes a dramatic improvement on a more standard
multigrid preconditioner approach, and also show that the additive smoother
produces better results than standard SOR smoothing. This new solver method
makes it feasible to run nonhydrostatic unstructured mesh ocean models in small

Jordan-Wigner transformations, which map it in a non-interacting fermion
system. The partition function can be determined in closed form at arbitrary
temperature and for arbitrary multiplicity of the multiple spin interaction.
  From this result all relevant thermodynamic functions are obtained and, due
to the long-range interactions, the model can present classical and quantum
transitions of first- and second-order. The study of its critical behavior is
restricted for the quantum transitions, which are induced by the transverse
field at $T=0.$ The phase diagram is explicitly obtained for multiplicities
$p=2,3,4$ and $\infty ,$ as a function of the interaction parameters, and, in
these cases, the critical behavior of the model is studied\textbf{\}in detail.
Explicit results are also presented for the induced magnetization and
isothermal susceptibility $\chi_{T}^{zz}$, and a detailed analysis is also
carried out for the static longitudinal $<S_{j}^{z}S_{l}^{z}>$ and transversal
$<S_{j}^{x}S_{l}^{x}>$ correlation functions. The different phases presented by
the model can be characterized by the spatial decay of the these correlations,
and from these results some of these can be classified as quantum spin liquid

contrast, while the standard SPH shows the absence of the instability across a
density gradient (Agertz et al. 2007). The interaction of a dense blob with a
hot ambient medium has been performed also. The Godunov SPH describes the
formation and evolution of the fingers due to the combinations of
Rayleigh-Taylor, Richtmyer-Meshkov, and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. The
blob test result coincides well with the results of the grid-based codes. An
inaccurate handling of a density gradient in the standard SPH has been pointed
out as the direct reason of the absence of the instabilities. An unphysical
force happens at the density gradient even in a pressure equilibrium, and
repulses particles from the initial density discontinuity. Therefore, the
initial perturbation damps, and a gap forms at the discontinuity. The
unphysical force has been studied in terms of the consistency of a numerical
scheme. Contrary to the standard SPH, the momentum equation of the Godunov SPH
doesnt use the particle approximation, and has been derived from the kernel
convolution or a new Lagrangian function. The new Lagrangian function used in
the Godunov SPH is more analogous to the real Lagrangian function for
continuum. The momentum equation of the Godunov SPH has much better linear
consistency, so the unphysical force is greatly reduced compared to the
standard SPH in a high density contrast.

the inertial range scales with the wave number $k$ as $k^{-5/3}$ and extends up
to a dissipation wave number $k_\nu$, which is given in terms of the energy
dissipation rate $\epsilon$ and viscosity $\nu$ by
$k_\nu\propto(\epsilon/\nu^3)^{1/4}$. This result leads to Landau's heuristic
estimate for the number of degrees of freedom that scales as $\Re^{9/4}$, where
$\Re$ is the Reynolds number. Here we consider the possibility of establishing
a quantitative basis for these results from first principles. In particular, we
examine the extent to which they can be derived from the three-dimensional
Navier--Stokes system, making use of Kolmogorov's hypothesis of finite and
viscosity-independent energy dissipation only. It is found that the Taylor
microscale wave number $k_T$ (a close cousin of $k_\nu$) can be expressed in
the form $k_T \le CU/\nu = (CU/\norm{\u})^{1/2}(\epsilon/\nu^3)^{1/4}$. Here
$U$ and $\norm{\u}$ are, respectively, a ``microscale'' velocity and the root
mean square velocity, and $C\le1$ is a dynamical parameter. This result can be
seen to be in line with Kolmogorov's prediction for $k_\nu$. Furthermore, it is
shown that the minimum number of greatest Lyapunov exponents whose sum becomes
negative does not exceed $\Re^{9/4}$, where $\Re$ is defined in terms of an
average energy dissipation rate, the system length scale, and $\nu$. This
result is in a remarkable agreement with the Landau estimate, up to a
presumably slight discrepancy between the conventional and the present energy
dissipation rates used in the definition of $\Re$.

the $T$-linear resistivity extends over a very wide doping range, in marked
contrast to expectations from conventional quantum critical scenarios. The
coefficient of this $T$-linear resistivity scales with the superconducting
transition temperature $T_c$, implying that the interaction causing this
anomalous scattering is also associated with the superconducting pairing
mechanism. At high temperatures, the coefficient of the $T$-linear resistivity
is essentially doping independent beyond a critical doping $p_{\rm crit}$ =
0.19 at which the ratio of the two coefficients is maximal. Taking our cue from
earlier thermodynamic and photoemission measurements, we conclude that the
opening of the normal state pseudogap at $p_{\rm crit}$ is driven by the loss
of coherence of anti-nodal quasiparticles at low temperatures.

governed by a family of model equations, in which the active scalar
$\theta=(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}\psi$ is advected by the incompressible flow
$\u=(-\psi_y,\psi_x)$. The dynamics of this family are characterized by the
material conservation of $\theta$, whose variance $<\theta^2>$ is
preferentially transferred to high wave numbers. As this transfer proceeds to
ever-smaller scales, the gradient $\nabla\theta$ grows without bound. This
growth is due to the stretching term $(\nabla\theta\cdot\nabla)\u$ whose
``effective degree of nonlinearity'' differs from one member of the family to
another. This degree depends on the relation between the advecting flow $\u$
and the active scalar $\theta$ and is wide ranging, from approximately linear
to highly superlinear. Linear dynamics are realized when $\nabla\u$ is a
quantity of no smaller scales than $\theta$, so that it is insensitive to the
direct transfer of the variance of $\theta$, which is nearly passively
advected. This case corresponds to $\alpha\ge2$, for which the growth of
$\nabla\theta$ is approximately exponential in time and non-accelerated. For
$\alpha<2$, superlinear dynamics are realized as the direct transfer of
$<\theta^2>$ entails a growth in $\nabla\u$, thereby enhancing the production
of $\nabla\theta$. This superlinearity reaches the familiar quadratic
nonlinearity of three-dimensional turbulence at $\alpha=1$ and surpasses that
for $\alpha<1$. The usual vorticity equation ($\alpha=2$) is the border line,
where $\nabla\u$ and $\theta$ are of the same scale, separating the linear and
nonlinear regimes of the small-scale dynamics. We discuss these regimes in
detail, with an emphasis on the locality of the direct transfer.

implies that the energy spectrum remains no steeper than $k^{-2}$ in that

$\epsilon\le\sqrt{3}k_0\norm{u_0}_\infty\norm{u_0}^2$, where $k_0$ marks the
lower end of the inertial range and $u_0=u(x,0)$. This implies
$N\le\sqrt{3}L\norm{u_0}_\infty/\nu$, where $L$ is the domain size, which is
shown to coincide with a rigorous estimate for the number of degrees of freedom

group of isometries acting on a Banach space, which extends the spectral theory
of Arveson. The concept of continuous Arveson spectrum is introduced and the
corresponding spectral subspace is defined. The absolutely continuous and
singular-continuous parts of this spectrum are specified. Conditions are given,
in terms of the transposed action of the group of isometries, which guarantee
that the pure-point and continuous subspaces span the entire Banach space. In
the case of a unitarily implemented group of automorphisms, acting on a
$C^*$-algebra, relations between the continuous spectrum of the automorphisms
and the spectrum of the implementing group of unitaries are found. The group of
spacetime translation automorphisms in quantum field theory is analyzed in
detail. In particular, it is shown that the structure of its continuous
spectrum is relevant to the problem of existence of (infra-)particles in a
given theory.

characterized by the motif rank patterns observed in the nearest-neighbor

superfamily classification are unclear. We attack this problem by studying the
influence of linear temporal correlations and multifractality using fractional
Brownian motions (FBMs) and multifractal random walks (MRWs). Numerical
investigations unveil that the classification of superfamily phenomenon is
uniquely determined by the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) scaling
exponent $\alpha$ of the time series. Only four motif patterns are observed in
the simulated data, which are delimited by three DFA scaling exponents $\alpha
\simeq 0.25$, $\alpha \simeq 0.35$ and $\alpha \simeq 0.45$. The validity of
the result is confirmed by stock market indexes and turbulence velocity

advances in our understanding of the planet and its moons, it has left us with
puzzling questions: What is the bulk composition of the planet? Does it have a
helium core? Is it enriched in noble gases like Jupiter? What powers and
controls its gigantic storms? We have learned that we can measure an outer
magnetic field that is filtered from its non-axisymmetric components, but what
is Saturn's inner magnetic field? What are the rings made of and when were they
formed? These questions are crucial in several ways: a detailed comparison of
the compositions of Jupiter and Saturn is necessary to understand processes at
work during the formation of these two planets and of the Solar System. This
calls for the continued exploration of the second largest planet in our Solar
System, with a variety of means including remote observations and space
missions. Measurements of gravity and magnetic fields very close to the
planet's cloud tops would be extremely valuable. Very high spatial resolution
images of the rings would provide details on their structure and the material
that form them. Last but not least, one or several probes sent into the
atmosphere of the planet would provide the critical measurements that would
allow a detailed comparison with the same measurements at Jupiter. [abridged

The main feature of the spatial large-scale galaxy distribution is
an intricate network of galaxy filaments. Although many attempts have been made
to quantify this network, there is no unique and satisfactory recipe for that
yet. Aims. The present paper compares the filaments in the real data and in the
numerical models, to see if our best models reproduce statistically the
filamentary network of galaxies. Methods. We apply an object point process with
interactions (the Bisous process) to trace and describe the filamentary network
both in the observed samples (the 2dFGRS catalogue) and in the numerical models
that have been prepared to mimic the data.We compare the networks. Results. We
find that the properties of filaments in numerical models (mock samples) have a
large variance. A few mock samples display filaments that resemble the observed
filaments, but usually the model filaments are much shorter and do not form an
extended network. Conclusions. We conclude that although we can build numerical
models that are similar to observations in many respects, they may fail yet to
explain the filamentary structure seen in the data. The Bisous-built filaments
are a good test for such a structure.

The presented analytical model accurately describes the complete emission

modes evolve as they become increasingly more bound, i.e. plasmonic. The
results illustrate why efficient antennas should not be too plasmonic, and how
subradiant even modes can evolve into weakly-interacting dark modes. Our

is thus widely applicable.

estimation by information projection in order to warrants that the solution is
a nonnegative function. The spectral density of the process is estimated by
projecting the wavelet thresholding expansion of the periodogram onto a family
of exponential functions. This ensures that the spectral density estimator is a
strictly positive function. Then, by Bochner's theorem, the corresponding
estimator of the covariance function is semidefinite positive. The theoretical
behavior of the estimator is established in terms of rate of convergence of the
Kullback-Leibler discrepancy over Besov classes. We also show the excellent
practical performance of the estimator in some numerical experiments.
