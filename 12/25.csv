Evidence of such modifications has been recently obtained with the Chandra and

semi-analytical kinetic model of shock acceleration with a 3D hydrodynamic code
(by means of an effective adiabatic index). This enables us to study the
time-dependent compression of the region between the forward and reverse shocks
due to the back reaction of accelerated particles, concomitantly with the
development of the Rayleigh-Taylor hydrodynamic instability at the contact
discontinuity. Density profiles depend critically on the injection level eta of
particles: for eta up to about 10^-4 modifications are weak and progressive,
for eta of the order of 10^-3 modifications are strong and immediate.
Nevertheless, the extension of the Rayleigh-Taylor unstable region does not
depend on the injection rate. A first comparison of our simulations with
observations of Tycho's remnant strengthens the case for efficient acceleration
of protons at the forward shock.

within the last decade and have become enabling tools for atomic clocks, gas
sensing and astrophysical spectrometer calibration. The rapidly increasing
number of applications has heightened interest in more compact comb generators.
Optical microresonator based comb generators bear promise in this regard.
Critical to their future use as 'frequency markers', is however the absolute
frequency stabilization of the optical comb spectrum. A powerful technique for
this stabilization is self-referencing, which requires a spectrum that spans a
full octave, i.e. a factor of two in frequency. In the case of mode locked
lasers, overcoming the limited bandwidth has become possible only with the
advent of photonic crystal fibres for supercontinuum generation. Here, we
report for the first time the generation of an octave-spanning frequency comb
directly from a toroidal microresonator on a silicon chip. The comb spectrum
covers the wavelength range from 990 nm to 2170 nm and is retrieved from a
continuous wave laser interacting with the modes of an ultra high Q
microresonator, without relying on external broadening. Full tunability of the
generated frequency comb over a bandwidth exceeding an entire free spectral
range is demonstrated. This allows positioning of a frequency comb mode to any
desired frequency within the comb bandwidth. The ability to derive octave
spanning spectra from microresonator comb generators represents a key step
towards achieving a radio-frequency to optical link on a chip, which could
unify the fields of metrology with micro- and nano-photonics and enable
entirely new devices that bring frequency metrology into a chip scale setting
for compact applications such as space based optical clocks.

the vacuum with zero $\theta$, like $\eta\to \pi\pi$. We evaluate their rates
for such decays near hadronic freezeout. These rates, as well as charge
asymmetries already observed, are proportional to square of the CP-violating
parameter $<\theta^2>$ averaged over the fireball and events. With such input,
we found that the forbidden decay rates are likely to be orders of magnitude
larger than CP-allowed ones. We further estimated that up to about one per mill
of $\eta$ mesons produced in heavy ion collisions should decay in this way. We
further discuss how those can be observed. We argue using STAR data on charge
asymmetries for AuAu and CuCu collisions that the size of CP-odd spots at
freezeout is as large as Cu nuclei: this fortunate fact (not explained so far
by itself) suggests that the two-pion invariant mass is modified by only about
a percent, which is comparable to experimental resolution. If so, we think
experimental observation of these decays is within the reach of current
dataset. If those decays are found, it would confirm that CP-odd interpretation
of charge asyymetry is correct, even without complication related to geometry,
impact parameter or magnetic field induced on the fireball.

in phase space before returning to the stable state and trigger pulses and wave
trains. The voltage bias constraint causes new waves to be nucleated when old

are studied for ensembles of economic agents. The principle of entropy
maximization for partitioning of a limited resource gives exponential
distributions for the investigated variables. A non-equilibrium difference of
money temperatures between different systems generates net fluxes of money and
population. To describe income distribution, a stochastic process with additive
and multiplicative components is introduced. The resultant distribution
interpolates between exponential at the low end and power law at the high end,
in agreement with the empirical data for USA. We show that the increase of
income inequality in USA originates primarily from the increase of the income
fraction going to the upper tail, which now exceeds 20% of the total income.
Analyzing the data from the World Resources Institute, we find that the
distribution of energy consumption per capita around the world can be
approximately described by the exponential function. Comparing the data for
1990, 2000, and 2005, we discuss the effect of globalization on the inequality
of energy consumption.

and rather big amount (5-14 percents) of oxygen (bonded simultaneously with Mg
and B) can be present in the structure even if X-ray pattern contains only
reflexes of well crystallized MgB2 with traces of MgO. Materials with such a
rather high oxygen content demonstrated high superconducting characteristics.
At present it is established that nanosized MgB12 grains provide effective
pinning in polycrystalline material. Besides, additions can introduce the MgB2
structure inducing disorder in lattice sites (for example, C substitution for
B). The disorder increases the normal state resistivity, magnetic penetration
depth, and the upper critical field, but reduces the transition temperature and
anisotropy. It is highly probable that the additives (Ti, Ta, Zr, SiC) together
with synthesis or sintering temperature can affect the distribution of oxygen
and hydrogen in the material structure as well as the formation of grains of
higher borides, thus influencing superconducting properties. The
superconductivity of materials with matrix close to MgB12 in stoichiometry
(Tc=37 K) has been defined.

residue classes. The general phenomenon is that if $a$ is a nonsquare\mod q and
$b$ is a square\mod q, then there tend to be more primes congruent to $a\mod q$
than $b\mod q$ in initial intervals of the positive integers; more succinctly,
there is a tendency for $\pi(x;q,a)$ to exceed $\pi(x;q,b)$. Rubinstein and
Sarnak defined $\delta(q;a,b)$ to be the logarithmic density of the set of
positive real numbers $x$ for which this inequality holds; intuitively,
$\delta(q;a,b)$ is the ""probability"" that $\pi(x;q,a) > \pi(x;q,b)$ when $x$ is
""chosen randomly"". In this paper, we establish an asymptotic series for
$\delta(q;a,b)$ that can be instantiated with an error term smaller than any
negative power of $q$. This asymptotic formula is written in terms of a
variance $V(q;a,b)$ that is originally defined as an infinite sum over all
nontrivial zeros of Dirichlet $L$-functions corresponding to characters\mod q;
we show how $V(q;a,b)$ can be evaluated exactly as a finite expression. In
addition to providing the exact rate at which $\delta(q;a,b)$ converges to
$\frac12$ as $q$ grows, these evaluations allow us to compare the various
density values $\delta(q;a,b)$ as $a$ and $b$ vary modulo $q$; by analyzing the
resulting formulas, we can explain and predict which of these densities will be
larger or smaller, based on arithmetic properties of the residue classes $a$
and $b\mod q$. For example, we show that if $a$ is a prime power and $a'$ is
not, then $\delta(q;a,1) < \delta(q;a',1)$ for all but finitely many moduli $q$
for which both $a$ and $a'$ are nonsquares. Finally, we establish rigorous
numerical bounds for these densities $\delta(q;a,b)$ and report on extensive

Recovery (MSR) is an optimization problem proposed by Zheng, Zhu, and Sankoff
for reliably recovering syntenic blocks from genomic maps in the midst of noise
and ambiguities. Given $d$ genomic maps as sequences of gene markers, the
objective of \msr{d} is to find $d$ subsequences, one subsequence of each
genomic map, such that the total length of syntenic blocks in these
subsequences is maximized. For any constant $d \ge 2$, a polynomial-time
2d-approximation for \msr{d} was previously known. In this paper, we show that
for any $d \ge 2$, \msr{d} is APX-hard, even for the most basic version of the
problem in which all gene markers are distinct and appear in positive
orientation in each genomic map. Moreover, we provide the first explicit lower
bounds on approximating \msr{d} for all $d \ge 2$. In particular, we show that
\msr{d} is NP-hard to approximate within $\Omega(d/\log d)$. From the other
direction, we show that the previous 2d-approximation for \msr{d} can be
optimized into a polynomial-time algorithm even if $d$ is not a constant but is
part of the input. We then extend our inapproximability results to several
