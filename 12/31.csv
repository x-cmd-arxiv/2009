N^(k-2)MHV scattering amplitudes in N=4 SYM to a simple contour integral over
the Grassmannian G(k,n) makes all the symmetries of the theory manifest. Every
residue is individually Yangian invariant, but does not have a local space-time
interpretation--only a special sum over residues gives physical amplitudes. In
this paper we show that the sum over residues giving tree amplitudes can be
unified into a single algebraic variety, which we explicitly construct for all
NMHV and N^2MHV amplitudes. Remarkably, this allows the contour integral to
have a ""particle interpretation"" in the Grassmannian, where higher-point
amplitudes can be constructed from lower-point ones by adding one particle at a
time, with soft limits manifest. We move on to show that the connected
prescription for tree amplitudes in Witten's twistor string theory also admits
a Grassmannian particle interpretation, where the integral over the
Grassmannian localizes over the Veronese map from G(2,n) to G(k,n). These
apparently very different theories are related by a natural deformation with a
parameter t that smoothly interpolates between them. For NMHV amplitudes, we
use a simple residue theorem to prove t-independence of the result, thus
establishing a novel kind of duality between these theories.

of entanglement are equal for all of our numerical simulations, but a proof of
their general equality for this setting evades us for now. Also, some of our
simulations demonstrate that the relative entropy of entanglement without the
single-excitation restriction is much lower than the quantum discord. The first
picosecond of dynamics is the relevant timescale for the transfer of the
excitation, according to some sources in the literature. Our simulation results
indicate that quantum correlations contribute a significant fraction of the
total correlation during this first picosecond in many cases, at both cryogenic

its stability against quantum fluctuations. The corresponding orbital order
consisting of two inequivalent orbital chains is consistent with the
experimentally observed tetragonal symmetry. A periodic modulation of electron
density function along orbital chains is shown to arise from the staggering of
local trigonal axes. In the presence of orbital order, single-ion spin
anisotropy arising from relativistic spin-orbit interaction stabilizes the

deuterium as an isothermal transition of Rydberg matter into a high density
phase by quantum mechanical exchange forces. It is conjectured that the
transition is made possible by the formation of vortices in a Cooper pair
electron fluid, separating the electrons from the deuterons, with the deuterons
undergoing Bose-Einstein condensation in the core of the vortices. If such a
state of deuterium should exist at the reported density of about 100,000 g/cm3,
it would greatly facility the ignition of a thermonuclear detonation wave in
pure deuterium, by placing the deuterium in a thin disc, to be ignited by a
pulsed ultrafast laser or particle beam of modest energy.

ability to fold to their native states without any additional external forces
invoked. A mechanism is suggested for folding of these proteins, such as YibK
and YbeA, which involves an intermediate configuration with a slipknot. It
elucidates the role of topological barriers and backtracking during the folding
event. It also illustrates that native contacts are sufficient to guarantee
folding in around 1-2% of the simulations, and how slipknot intermediates are
needed to reduce the topological bottlenecks. As expected, simulations of
proteins with similar structure but with knot removed fold much more
efficiently, clearly demonstrating the origin of these topological barriers.
Although these studies are based on a simple coarse-grained model, they are
already able to extract some of the underlying principles governing folding in

formation in particles collisions. The current paradigm suggests that BH/WH
formation in particles collisions will happen when center of mass energies of
colliding particles is sufficiently above the Planck scale (the transplanckian
region). To estimate the BH/WH production we use the classical geometrical
cross section. We confirm the classical geometrical cross section of the BH
production reconsidering the process of two transplanckian particles collision
in the rest frame of one of incident particles. This consideration permits to
use the standard Thorne's hoop conjecture for a matter compressed into a region
to prove a variant of the conjecture dealing with a total amount of compressed
energy in the case of colliding particles. We calculate geometrical cross
sections for different processes and for different background, in particular,
for (A)dS. We show that results are in agreement with closed trapped surface
(CTS) estimations though there are no general theorems providing that the BH
formation follows from CTS's formation. We show that the process of BH
formation is catalyzed by the negative cosmological constant and by a
particular scalar matter, namely dilaton, while it is relaxed by the positive
cosmological constant and at a critical value just turns off. Also we note that
the cross section is sensible to the compactification of extra dimensions and
to the particular brane model.

computation does not satisfy the requirement. At the fundamental physical
level, it is a network of two body interactions, each the input-output
transformation of a universal Boolean gate. Thus, it cannot process together at
the same time more than the three bit input of this gate - many such gates in
parallel do not count since the information is not processed together. Quantum
computation satisfies the requirement. At the light of our recent explanation
of the speed up, quantum measurement of the solution of the problem is
analogous to a many body interaction between the parts of a perfect classical
machine, whose mechanical constraints represent the problem to be solved. The
many body interaction satisfies all the constraints together at the same time,
producing the solution in one shot. This shades light on the physical
computation level of the theories that place consciousness in quantum
measurement and explains how informations coming from disparate sensorial
channels come together in the unity of subjective experience. The fact that the
fundamental mechanism of consciousness is the same of the quantum speed up,
gives quantum consciousness a potentially enormous evolutionary advantage.

expansion that slightly deviates from the orthodox doctrine, in that the
matching coefficients are not truly of ``short-distance"" nature, but explicitly
depend upon physical kinematic variables rather than partonic ones. Our
matching method, with validity guaranteed by the Gremm-Kapustin relation, is
particularly suited for the inclusive quarkonium production and decay processes
with involved kinematics, exemplified by the process $e^+e^-\to J/\psi+gg$
considered in this work. Despite some intrinsic ambiguity affiliated with the
order-$v^2$ NRQCD matrix element, if we choose its value as what has been
extracted from a recent Cornell-potential-model-based analysis, including the
relative order-$v^2$ effect is found to increase the lowest-order prediction
for the integrated $J/\psi$ cross section by about 30\%, and exert a modest
impact on $J/\psi$ energy, angular and polarization distributions except near
the very upper end of the $J/\psi$ energy. The order-$v^2$ contribution to the
energy spectrum becomes logarithmically divergent at the maximum of $J/\psi$
energy. A consistent analysis may require that these large end-point logarithms
be resummed to all orders in $\alpha_s$.

logic programming, our formal techniques are analogous to those of
distance-based belief revision in propositional logic. In developing our
results, we build upon the model theory of logic programs furnished by SE
models. Since SE models provide a formal, monotonic characterisation of logic
programs, we can adapt techniques from the area of belief revision to belief
change in logic programs. We introduce methods for revising and merging logic
programs, respectively. For the former, we study both subset-based revision as
well as cardinality-based revision, and we show that they satisfy the majority
of the AGM postulates for revision. For merging, we consider operators
following arbitration merging and IC merging, respectively. We also present
encodings for computing the revision as well as the merging of logic programs
within the same logic programming framework, giving rise to a direct
implementation of our approach in terms of off-the-shelf answer set solvers.
These encodings reflect in turn the fact that our change operators do not
increase the complexity of the base formalism.

which can be applied to general non-separable primordial and CMB bispectra. The
method exploits bispectrum mode decompositions on the domain of allowed
wavenumber or multipole values. Concrete mode examples constructed from
symmetrised tetrahedral polynomials are given, demonstrating rapid convergence
for known bispectra. We use these modes to generate simulated CMB maps of high
resolution (l > 2000) given an arbitrary primordial power spectrum and
bispectrum or an arbitrary late-time CMB angular power spectrum and bispectrum.
By extracting coefficients for the same separable basis functions from an
observational map, we are able to present an efficient and general f_NL
estimator for a given theoretical model. The estimator has two versions
comparing theoretical and observed coefficients at either primordial or late
times, thus encompassing a wider range of models, including secondary
anisotropies, lensing and cosmic strings. We provide examples and validation of
both f_NL estimation methods by direct comparison with simulations in a
WMAP-realistic context. In addition, we show how the full bispectrum can be
extracted from observational maps using these mode expansions, irrespective of
the theoretical model under study. We also propose a universal definition of
the bispectrum parameter F_NL for more consistent comparison between
theoretical models. We obtain WMAP5 estimates of f_NL for the equilateral model
from both our primordial and late-time estimators which are consistent with
each other, as well as with results already published in the literature. These
general bispectrum estimation methods should prove useful for the analysis of
nonGaussianity in the Planck satellite data, as well as in other contexts.

infinite game is defined as a play consisting of a fixed number of players
whose sequence of moves is repeated, or iterated ad infinitum. Each sequence
corresponds to a single iteration of the play, where there are an infinite
amount of iterations. There are two distinct concepts within this broad
definition which encompass all infinite games: the strong infinite game and the
weak infinite game. Both differ in terms of imputations. The strong infinite
game has a uniqueness qualification in that all moves must differ to the extent
that no imputation (these occur at the end of any given iteration) may ever be
the same. Conversely, there is no such qualification in a weak infinite game,
any payout may equal another.
  Another property shared by strong and weak infinite games (apart from their
fulfilling the criterion of an infinite game) is the fact that both consist of
a countably infinite amount of moves. Therefore all infinite games have a
countably infinite number of turns; the set of all infinite games is composed
of each strong and weak infinite game. This result has a very important
consequence: the ordinality of turns. That is, the moves of an infinite game
have an order or structure which they adhere to. It is this structure which
provides any future development or game theoretical analysis of these sorts of
games with the necessary foundation.

theory. Stated informally, these require that systems appear completely
classical as restricted to a single measurement, that different measurements,
and likewise different pure states, be equivalent (up to the action of a
compact group of symmetries), and that every state be the marginal of a
bipartite non-signaling state perfectly correlating two measurements.
  This much yields a mathematical representation of measurements and states
that is already very suggestive of quantum mechanics. In particular, in any
theory satisfying these axioms, measurements can be represented by orthonormal
subsets of, and states, by vectors in, an ordered real Hilbert space -- in the
quantum case, the space of Hermitian operators, with its usual tracial inner
product. One final postulate (a simple minimization principle, still in need of
a clear interpretation) forces the positive cone of this space to be
homogeneous and self-dual and hence, to be the the state space of a formally
real Jordan algebra. From here, the route to the standard framework of
finite-dimensional quantum mechanics is quite short.

b_i of B, there exists an observable a_i on A such that the states of B

perhaps not canonically isomorphic, to their dual spaces), the assumption that
every state of a system A is steered by some bipartite state of a composite AA
consisting of two copies of A, amounts to the homogeneity of the state cone. If
the state space is actually self-dual, and not just weakly so, this implies
(via the Koecher-Vinberg Theorem) that it is the self-adjoint part of a

However, it turned out to be difficult to establish a sound constraint calculus

investigation into dipole constraint calculi which uses algebraic methods to

  In contrast to the points that are normally used, dipoles are extended and
have an intrinsic direction. Both features are important properties of natural

quantum) channel is used to simulate a noiseless one, reverse Shannon theorems
concern the use of noiseless channels to simulate noisy ones, and more
generally the use of one noisy channel to simulate another. For channels of
nonzero capacity, this simulation is always possible, but for it to be
efficient, auxiliary resources of the proper kind and amount are generally
required. In the classical case, shared randomness between sender and receiver
is a sufficient auxiliary resource, regardless of the nature of the source, but
in the quantum case the requisite auxiliary resources for efficient simulation
depend on both the channel being simulated, and the source from which the
channel inputs are coming. For tensor power sources (the quantum generalization
of classical IID sources), entanglement in the form of standard ebits
(maximally entangled pairs of qubits) is sufficient, but for general sources,
which may be arbitrarily correlated or entangled across channel inputs,
additional resources, such as entanglement-embezzling states or backward
communication, are generally needed. Combining existing and new results, we
establish the amounts of communication and auxiliary resources needed in both
the classical and quantum cases, the tradeoffs among them, and the loss of
simulation efficiency when auxiliary resources are absent or insufficient. In
particular we find a new single-letter expression for the excess forward
communication cost of coherent feedback simulations of quantum channels (i.e.
simulations in which the sender retains what would escape into the environment
in an ordinary simulation), on non-tensor-power sources in the presence of
unlimited ebits but no other auxiliary resource. Our results on tensor power
sources establish a strong converse to the entanglement-assisted capacity
theorem.

regarded as a basis for the Lie algebra gl(d,C). In this paper we examine the
resulting structure constants, which are calculated from the traces of the
triple products of the SIC-POVM elements and which, it turns out, characterize
the SIC-POVM up to unitary equivalence. We show that the structure constants
have numerous remarkable properties. In particular we show that the existence
of a SIC-POVM in dimension d is equivalent to the existence of a certain
structure in the adjoint representation of gl(d,C). We hope that transforming
the problem in this way, from a question about quantum state space to a
question about Lie algebras, may help to make the existence problem tractable.

smaller L^* and a steeper faint-end slope than that of the field. Confirming
this trend, we also found that faint-end slopes of the cluster LFs becomes
flatter and flatter with decreasing local galaxy density. These changes in LFs
cannot be explained by a simple infall of field galaxy population into a
cluster. Physics that can preferentially suppress IR luminous galaxies in high
density regions is required to explain the observed results.

are strongly correlated with their SZE signals (at the 99% confidence level

used as a measure of virial mass. Simulations predict a powerlaw scaling of
$Y_{SZ}\propto M_{200}^\alpha$ with $\alpha\approx$1.6. Observationally, we
find $\alpha$=1.11$\pm$0.16, significantly shallower (given the formal

of our sample is unknown and a bias against less massive clusters cannot be
excluded (such a selection bias could artificially flatten the slope).
Moreover, our sample indicates that the relation between velocity dispersion

comparable to the range of our current sample. More detailed studies of scaling
relations are therefore needed to derive a robust determination of the relation
between cluster mass and SZE.

statistical analysis of the albedo and redistribution efficiency for 24

each planet, we show how to calculate a sub-stellar equilibrium temperature,
T_0, and associated uncertainty. We then use a simple model-independent
technique to estimate a planet's effective temperature from planet/star flux
ratios. We use thermal secondary eclipse measurements -those obtained at
lambda>0.8 micron- to estimate day-side effective temperatures, T_d, and
thermal phase variations -when available- to estimate night-side effective
temperature. We strongly rule out the ""null hypothesis"" of a single A_B and
epsilon for all 24 planets. If we allow each planet to have different
parameters, we find that low Bond albedos are favored (A_B<0.35 at 1 sigma
confidence), which is an independent confirmation of the low albedos inferred
from non-detection of reflected light. Our sample exhibits a wide variety of
redistribution efficiencies. When normalized by T_0, the day-side effective
temperatures of the 24 planets describe a uni-modal distribution. The
dimensionless quantity T_d/T_0 exhibits no trend with the presence or absence
of stratospheric inversions. There is also no clear trend between T_d/T_0 and
T_0. That said, the 6 planets with the greatest sub-stellar equilibrium

asymptotic behavior with well-known exponential growth of Wilson loop in N=4
super Yang-Mills theory. For theory with gauge group SU(N) coupled to 2N
fundamental hypermultiplets, we find that Wilson loop exhibits non-exponential
growth -- at most, it can grow a power of `t Hooft coupling. For theory with
gauge group SU(N) x SU(N) and bifundamental hypermultiplets, there are two
Wilson loops associated with two gauge groups. We find Wilson loop in untwisted
sector grows exponentially large as in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. We then
find Wilson loop in twisted sector exhibits non-analytic behavior with respect
to difference of two `t Hooft coupling constants. By letting one gauge coupling
constant hierarchically larger/smaller than the other, we show that Wilson
loops in the second type theory interpolate to Wilson loop in the first type
theory. We infer implications of these findings from holographic dual
description in terms of minimal surface of dual string worldsheet. We suggest
intuitive interpretation that in both type theories holographic dual background
must involve string scale geometry even at planar and large `t Hooft coupling
limit and that new results found in the gauge theory side are attributable to
worldsheet instantons and infinite resummation therein. Our interpretation also
indicate that holographic dual of these gauge theories is provided by certain

mobile devices obtain their own location with the help of Global Navigation
Satellite Systems (GNSS), integrating, for example, a Global Positioning System
(GPS) receiver. Nonetheless, an adversary can compromise location-aware
applications by attacking the GNSS-based positioning: It can forge navigation
messages and mislead the receiver into calculating a fake location. In this
paper, we analyze this vulnerability and propose and evaluate the effectiveness
of countermeasures. First, we consider replay attacks, which can be effective
even in the presence of future cryptographic GNSS protection mechanisms. Then,
we propose and analyze methods that allow GNSS receivers to detect the
reception of signals generated by an adversary, and then reject fake locations
calculated because of the attack. We consider three diverse defense mechanisms,
all based on knowledge, in particular, own location, time, and Doppler shift,
receivers can obtain prior to the onset of an attack. We find that inertial
mechanisms that estimate location can be defeated relatively easy. This is
equally true for the mechanism that relies on clock readings from off-the-shelf
devices; as a result, highly stable clocks could be needed. On the other hand,
our Doppler Shift Test can be effective without any specialized hardware, and
it can be applied to existing devices.

field equations and those for static axially symmetric self-dual SU(2) gauge
fields can both be reduced to the same (Ernst) equation. In this paper we use
this result as point of departure to prove the existence of the mass gap for
quantum source-free Yang-Mills (Y-M) fields. The proof is facilitated by
results of our recently published paper, JGP 59 (2009) 600-619. Since both pure
gravity, the Einstein-Maxwell and pure Y-M fields are described for axially
symmetric configurations by the Ernst equation classically, their quantum
descriptions are likely to be interrelated. Correctness of this conjecture is
successfully checked by reproducing (by different methods) results of Korotkin
and Nicolai, Nucl.Phys.B475 (1996) 397-439, on dimensionally reduced quantum
gravity. Consequently, numerous new results supporting the Faddeev-Skyrme (F-S)
-type models are obtained. We found that the F-S-like model is best suited for
description of electroweak interactions while strong interactions require
extension of Witten's results to the SU(3) gauge group. Such an extension is
nontrivial. It is linked with the symmetry group SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1) of the
Standard Model. This result is quite rigid and should be taken into account in
development of all grand unified theories. Also, the alternative (to the
F-S-like) model emerges as by-product of such an extension. Both models are
related to each other via known symmetry transformation. Both models possess
gap in their excitation spectrum and are capable of producing knotted/linked
configurations of gauge/gravity fields. In addition, the paper discusses
relevance of the obtained results to heterotic strings and to scattering
processes involving topology change. It ends with discussion about usefulness

ongoing study of the young (150 Myr) open cluster M35 (NGC 2168). We have
observed M35 since 1997, using the Hydra Multi-Object Spectrograph on the WIYN
3.5m telescope. Our stellar sample covers main-sequence stars over a magnitude
range of 13.0<V<16.5 (1.6 - 0.8 Msun) and extends spatially to a radius of 30
arcminutes (7 pc in projection at a distance of 805 pc or 4 core radii). Due to
its youth, M35 provides a sample of late-type stars with a range of rotation
periods. Therefore, we analyze the radial-velocity measurement precision as a
function of the projected rotational velocity. For narrow-lined stars (v sin i
< 10 km/s), the radial velocities have a precision of 0.5 km/s, which degrades
to 1.0 km/s for stars with v sin i = 50 km/s. The radial-velocity distribution
shows a well-defined cluster peak with a central velocity of -8.16 +/- 0.05
km/s, permitting a clean separation of the cluster and field stars. For stars
with >=3 measurements, we derive radial-velocity membership probabilities and
identify radial-velocity variables, finding 360 cluster members, 55 of which
show significant radial- velocity variability. Using these cluster members, we
construct a color-magnitude diagram for our stellar sample cleaned of field
star contamination. We also compare the spatial distribution of the single and
binary cluster members, finding no evidence for mass segregation in our stellar
sample. Accounting for measurement precision, we place an upper limit on the
radial-velocity dispersion of the cluster of 0.81 +/- 0.08 km/s. After
correcting for undetected binaries, we derive a true radial-velocity dispersion
of 0.65 +/- 0.10 km/s.

a practical method, grounded in the information-theoretic analysis of
prediction, for inferring a minimal representation of that structure and for
characterizing its complexity. Starting from spike trains, our approach finds
their causal state models (CSMs), the minimal hidden Markov models or
stochastic automata capable of generating statistically identical time series.
We then use these CSMs to objectively quantify both the generalizable structure
and the idiosyncratic randomness of the spike train. Specifically, we show that
the expected algorithmic information content (the information needed to
describe the spike train exactly) can be split into three parts describing (1)
the time-invariant structure (complexity) of the minimal spike-generating
process, which describes the spike train statistically; (2) the randomness
(internal entropy rate) of the minimal spike-generating process; and (3) a
residual pure noise term not described by the minimal spike-generating process.
We use CSMs to approximate each of these quantities. The CSMs are inferred
nonparametrically from the data, making only mild regularity assumptions, via
the causal state splitting reconstruction algorithm. The methods presented here
complement more traditional spike train analyses by describing not only spiking
probability and spike train entropy, but also the complexity of a spike train's
structure. We demonstrate our approach using both simulated spike trains and
experimental data recorded in rat barrel cortex during vibrissa stimulation.

and geometric structures that naturally arise on manifolds equipped with a
closed nondegenerate (n+1)-form. The case relevant to classical string theory
is when n=2 and is called ""2-plectic geometry"". Just as the Poisson bracket
makes the smooth functions on a symplectic manifold into a Lie algebra, there
is a Lie 2-algebra of observables associated to any 2-plectic manifold. String
theory, closed 3-forms and Lie 2-algebras also play important roles in the
theory of Courant algebroids. Courant algebroids are vector bundles which
generalize the structures found in tangent bundles and quadratic Lie algebras.
It is known that a particular kind of Courant algebroid (called an exact
Courant algebroid) naturally arises in string theory, and that such an
algebroid is classified up to isomorphism by a closed 3-form on the base space,
which then induces a Lie 2-algebra structure on the space of global sections.
In this paper we begin to establish precise connections between 2-plectic
manifolds and Courant algebroids. We prove that any manifold M equipped with a
2-plectic form omega gives an exact Courant algebroid E_omega over M with
Severa class [omega], and we construct an embedding of the Lie 2-algebra of
observables into the Lie 2-algebra of sections of E_omega. We then show that
this embedding identifies the observables as particular infinitesimal
symmetries of E_omega which preserve the 2-plectic structure on M.

cryptography. Generally speaking, there are two aspects to this partnership.
First there is the application of game theory to cryptography. Yet, the purpose
of this paper is to focus on the second aspect, the converse of the first, the
application of cryptography to game theory. Chiefly, there exist a branch of
non-cooperative games which have a correlated equilibrium as their solution.
These equilibria tend to be superior to the conventional Nash equilibria. The
primary condition for a correlated equilibrium is the presence of a mediator
within the game. This is simply a neutral and mutually trusted entity. It is
the role of the mediator to make recommendations in terms of strategy profiles
to all players, who then act (supposedly) on this advice. Each party privately
provides the mediator with the necessary information, and the referee responds
privately with their optimized strategy set. However, there seem to be a
multitude of situations in which no mediator could exist. Thus, games modeling
these sorts of cases could not use these entities as tools for analysis. Yet,
if these equilibria are in the best interest of players, it would be rational
to construct a machine, or protocol, to calculate them. Of course, this machine
would need to satisfy some standard for secure transmission between a player
and itself. The requirement that no third party could detect either the input
or strategy profile would need to be satisfied by this scheme. Here is the
synthesis of cryptography into game theory; analyzing the ability of the
players to construct a protocol which can be used successfully in the place of
a mediator.

errors. Significantly, this remains to be so even in the extreme case when
synchronization is not performed at all. Moving beyond a 3-node network, we
propose and investigate a synchronization scheme for PNC in a general chain
network. At last, numerical simulation verifies that PNC is robust to
synchronization errors. In particular, for the mutual information performance,
there is about 0.5dB loss without time synchronization and there is at most 2dB
loss without phase synchronization.

a semi-definite programming (SDP) based node localization algorithm in NLOS

magnetic moment (persistent current) of such a structure has been calculated
numerically and (approximately) analytically. It is shown that the current in
the N layer corresponding to the free-energy minimum is always diamagnetic. As
the field increases, the magnetic moment (current) exhibits jumps at certain
values of the trapped magnetic flux and the NS structure changes to a state
with smaller absolute value of the diamagnetic moment. This occurs when the
persistent current is unable to screen the external field. The magnetic moment
increase stepwise and the system changes into a new stable state. The magnetic
field penetrates into a larger volume of the N layer. The state has smaller
absolute value of the diamagnetic moment. Experimentally, this is interpreted
as the presence of a paramagnetic addition in the system (paramagnetic
reentrant effect). The results obtained are in qualitative agreement with the
experiments conducted by P. Visani et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 65, 1514 (1990)].

subsonic velocity of ~700 km/s toward west on the sky plane. We exclude the
possibility that this cool clump was formed by local inhomogeneous radiative
cooling in the intra-cluster medium, due to the effectiveness of the thermal
conduction on the time-scale of $\sim 0.3$ Gyr. Since no evidence for central
AGN activity has been found in Abell 3158, and this cool clump bears many
similarities to the off-centre cool gas clumps detected in other merging
clusters in terms of their mass, size, location, and thermal properties (e.g.
lower temperature and higher abundance as compared with the environment), we
speculate that the cool clump in Abell 3158 was caused by a merger event, and
is the remnant of the original central cool-core of the main cluster or the
infalling sub-cluster. This idea is supported not only by the study of
line-of-sight velocity distribution of the cluster member galaxies, but also by
the study of gas entropy-temperature correlation. This example shows that the
appearance of such massive, off-centre cool gas clumps can be used to diagnose
the dynamical state of a cluster, especially when prominent shocks and cold
fronts are absent.

the DAMA NaI experiments. We show that the two events seen in the CDMSII/Ge
experiment are consistent with the interactions of the anticipated heavy $\sim
Fe'$ component. This interpretation of the CDMSII/Ge events is a natural one
given that a) mirror dark matter predicts an event rate which is sharply
falling with respect to recoil energy and b) that the two observed events are
in the low energy region near threshold. Importantly this interpretation of the
CDMSII events can be checked by on-going and future experiments, and we hereby

superfluids after the two superfluids have been decoupled. We find that on
short time scales the relative phase shows ""light cone"" like dynamics and
creates a metastable superfluid state, which can be supercritical. We also
demonstrate similar light cone dynamics for the transverse field Ising model.
On longer time scales the supercritical state relaxes to a disordered state due
to dynamical vortex unbinding. This scenario of dynamically suppressed vortex
proliferation constitutes a reverse-Kibble-Zurek effect. We study this effect
both numerically using truncated Wigner approximation and analytically within a
newly suggested time dependent renormalization group approach (RG). In
particular, within RG we show that there are two possible fixed points for the
real time evolution corresponding to the superfluid and normal steady states.
So depending on the initial conditions and the microscopic parameters of the
Hamiltonian the system undergoes a non-equilibrium phase transition of the
Kosterlitz-Thouless type. The time scales for the vortex unbinding near the
critical point are exponentially divergent, similar to the equilibrium case.

total energy calculations based on the projector augmented wave (PAW) method to
investigate the initial growth patterns of pentacene (Pn) on Ag(111) surface.
In its bulk phase, pentacene crystallizes with a triclinic symmetry while a
thin film phase having an orthorhombic unit cell is energetically less
favorable by 0.12 eV/cell. Pentacene prefers to stay planar on Ag(111) surface
and aligns perfectly along silver rows without any molecular deformation at a
height of 3.9 {\AA}. At one monolayer (ML) coverage the separation between the
molecular layer and the surface plane extends to 4.1 {\AA} due to
intermolecular interactions weakening surface--pentacene attraction. While the
first ML remains flat, the molecules on a second full pentacene layer deposited
on the surface rearrange so that they become skewed with respect to each other.
This adsorption mode is energetically more preferable than the one for which
the molecules form a flat pentacene layer by an energy difference similar to
that obtained for bulk and thin film phases. Moreover, as new layers added,
pentacenes assemble to maintain this tilting for 3 and 4 ML similar to its bulk
phase while the contact layer always remains planar. Therefore, our
calculations indicate bulk-like initial stages for the growth pattern.

debated. Currently, the favoured model involves the accumulation of meter-sized
objects within a turbulent disc, followed by a phase of gravitational
instability. At best one can simulate a few million particles numerically as
opposed to the several trillion meter-sized particles expected in a real
protoplanetary disc. Therefore, single particles are often used as
super-particles to represent a distribution of many smaller particles. It is
assumed that small scale phenomena do not play a role and particle collisions
are not modeled. The super-particle approximation can only be valid in a
collisionless or strongly collisional system, however, in many recent numerical
simulations this is not the case.
  In this work we present new results from numerical simulations of
planetesimal formation via gravitational instability. A scaled system is
studied that does not require the use of super-particles. We find that the
scaled particles can be used to model the initial phases of clumping if the
properties of the scaled particles are chosen such that all important
timescales in the system are equivalent to what is expected in a real
protoplanetary disc. Constraints are given for the number of particles needed
in order to achieve numerical convergence.
  We compare this new method to the standard super-particle approach. We find
that the super-particle approach produces unreliable results that depend on
artifacts such as the gravitational softening in both the requirement for
gravitational collapse and the resulting clump statistics. Our results show
that short range interactions (collisions) have to be modelled properly.

be constructed by taking a quotient of a stationary black hole that has a
bifurcate Killing horizon. We discuss the geometric properties of these geon
black holes and the Hawking-Unruh effect on them. We in particular show how
correlations in the Hawking-Unruh effect reveal to an exterior observer

terminals, and with nonnegative integer capacities $c(v)$ and costs $a(v)$ of
nodes $v\in VG$. A path in $G$ is a \emph{$T$-path} if its ends are distinct
terminals. By a \emph{multiflow} we mean a function $F$ assigning to each
$T$-path $P$ a nonnegative rational \emph{weight} $F(P)$, and a multiflow is
called \emph{feasible} if the sum of weights of $T$-paths through each node $v$
does not exceed $c(v)$. The \emph{value} of $F$ is the sum of weights $F(P)$,
and the \emph{cost} of $F$ is the sum of $F(P)$ times the cost of $P$ w.r.t.
$a$, over all $T$-paths $P$.
  Generalizing known results on edge-capacitated multiflows, we show that the
problem of finding a minimum cost multiflow among the feasible multiflows of
maximum possible value admits \emph{half-integer} optimal primal and dual
solutions. Moreover, we devise a strongly polynomial algorithm for finding such
optimal solutions.

obtained with Gemini NIFS at a spatial resolution of 35 pc. This high spatial
resolution allowed us to observe, for the first time in this galaxy, an
unresolved dust concentration with mass 0.014 M_Sun, which may be part of the
dusty torus. The emission-line fluxes are elongated in PA=135/315deg in
agreement with the [OIII] and radio images and, except for the H lines, are
brighter to the north-west than to the south-east. The H emission is stronger
to the south-east, where we find a large region of star-formation. The strong
correlation between the radio emission and the highest emission-line fluxes
indicates that the radio jet plays a fundamental role at these intensity
levels. The H2 flux is more uniformly distributed and has an excitation
temperature of 2100 K. Its origin appears to be circumnuclear gas heated by
X-rays from the AGN. The [FeII] emission also is consistent with X-ray heating,
but with additional emission due to excitation by shocks in the radio jet. The
coronal-line emission of [CaVIII] and [SIX] are unresolved by our observations
indicating a distribution within 18pc from the nucleus. The reddening ranges
from E(B-V) ~ 0 to E(B-V) ~ 1.7 with the highest values defining a S-shaped
structure along PA ~ 135/315deg. The emission-line ratios are Seyfert-like
within the ionization cone indicating that the line emission is powered by the
central active nucleus in these locations. Low ionization regions are observed
away from the ionization cone, and may be powered by the diffuse radiation
field which filters through the ionization cone walls. Two regions at 0.5
arcsec south-east and at 1 arcsec north-west of the nucleus show starburst-like
line ratios, attributed to additional emission from star forming regions.

young star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We apply our recently
developed effective radius method for the assessment of stellar stratification
on imaging data obtained with the Advanced Camera for Surveys of three young
LMC clusters to characterize the phenomenon and develop a comparative scheme
for its assessment in such clusters. The clusters of our sample, NGC 1983, NGC
2002 and NGC 2010, are selected on the basis of their youthfulness, and their
variety in appearance, structure, stellar content, and surrounding stellar
ambient. Our photometry is complete for magnitudes down to m_814 ~ 23 mag,
allowing the calculation of the structural parameters of the clusters, the
estimation of their ages and the determination of their stellar content. Our
study shows that each cluster in our sample demonstrates stellar stratification
in a quite different manner and at different degree from the others.
Specifically, NGC 1983 shows to be partially segregated only for the faintest
stars of the cluster, NGC 2002 shows evidence of strong stellar stratification
for both bright and faint stars, and NGC 2010 is found not to be segregated.
For the parametrization of the phenomenon of stellar stratification and its
quantitative comparison among these clusters, we propose the slope derived from
the change in the effective radius over the corresponding magnitude range as
indicative parameter of the degree of stratification in the clusters. A
positive value of this slope indicates mass segregation in the cluster, while a
negative or zero value signifies the lack of the phenomenon.

excellent time series precisions are nearly Poisson limited at 11th magnitude
