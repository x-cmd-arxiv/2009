extends to an endomorphism of the structure.
  In this paper we consider finite homomorphism-homogeneous relational systems
with one reflexive binary relation. We show that for a large part of such
relational systems (bidirectionally connected digraphs; a digraph is
bidirectionally connected if each of its connected components can be traversed
by $\rightleftarrows$-paths) the problem of deciding whether the system is
homomorphism-homogeneous is coNP-complete. Consequently, for this class of

disconnected digraphs we present the full characterization. Our main result
states that if a digraph is bidirectionally disconnected, then it is
homomorphism-homogeneous if and only if it is either a finite
homomorphism-homogeneous quasiorder, or an inflation of a
homomorphism-homogeneous digraph with involution (a peculiar class of digraphs
introduced later in the paper), or an inflation of a digraph whose only

subsurface structure is not trivial. There are two main hypotheses for the
subsurface structure of sunspots: the monolithic model and the cluster model.
Local helioseismology is the only means by which we can investigate
subphotospheric structure. However, as current linear inversion techniques do
not yet allow helioseismology to probe the internal structure with sufficient
confidence to distinguish between the monolith and cluster models, the
development of physically realistic sunspot models are a priority for
helioseismologists. This is because they are not only important indicators of
the variety of physical effects that may influence helioseismic inferences in
active regions, but they also enable detailed assessments of the validity of
helioseismic interpretations through numerical forward modeling. In this paper,
we provide a critical review of the existing sunspot models and an overview of
numerical methods employed to model wave propagation through model sunspots. We
then carry out an helioseismic analysis of the sunspot in Active Region 9787
and address the serious inconsistencies uncovered by
\citeauthor{gizonetal2009}~(\citeyear{gizonetal2009,gizonetal2009a}). We find
that this sunspot is most probably associated with a shallow, positive
wave-speed perturbation (unlike the traditional two-layer model) and that
travel-time measurements are consistent with a horizontal outflow in the
surrounding moat.

rich new signal representation methods that use collections of subspaces
instead of vectors to represent signals. This work combines these exciting
fields to introduce a new sparsity model for fusion frames. Signals that are
sparse under the new model can be compressively sampled and uniquely
reconstructed in ways similar to sparse signals using standard CS. The
combination provides a promising new set of mathematical tools and signal
models useful in a variety of applications. With the new model, a sparse signal
has energy in very few of the subspaces of the fusion frame, although it does
not need to be sparse within each of the subspaces it occupies. This sparsity
model is captured using a mixed l1/l2 norm for fusion frames.
  A signal sparse in a fusion frame can be sampled using very few random
projections and exactly reconstructed using a convex optimization that
minimizes this mixed l1/l2 norm. The provided sampling conditions generalize
coherence and RIP conditions used in standard CS theory. It is demonstrated
that they are sufficient to guarantee sparse recovery of any signal sparse in

model on the sparse signal that shows that under very mild conditions the
probability of recovery failure decays exponentially with increasing dimension

namely an inversion center disappears in surface normal direction and only axes

piezomagnetic, piezoelectric and magnetoelectric effects in nanosystems, while
the effects can be absent in a bulk material. All these phenomena are inherent
to nanos made of materials belonging to all ninety bulk magnetic classes.
Therefore the new linear magnetoelectrics should appear among nanomaterials,
nonpiezomagnetic and nonpiezoelectric in the bulk. To demonstrate this we
consider the typical cases of ultra-thin films, nanowires and nanospheres.
Coupled with a surface stress for nanoparticles and a mismatch strains for thin
films on substrates the surface piezomagnetic and piezoelectric effects lead to
the appearance of built-in magnetic and electric fields respectively. The
built-in fields play an important role in the appearance of self-magnetization
and self-polarization in the nanosystems paramagnetic and paraelectric in the
bulk and can lead to the appearance of some other interesting properties absent
in the bulk. We obtained analytical dependencies on sizes for the built-in
fields and magnetoelectric coupling coefficients. The values of the built-in
fields increase with the decrease of film thickness h or nanoparticles radii R
as ~1/h or 1/R2 respectively, while the magnetoelectric coupling is inversely
proportional to the sizes in both cases. This shows the strong influence of
sizes on the considered properties of nanos and so opens the ways to govern the
properties by the choice of the sizes and to create new multifunctional
nanomaterials.

in terms of spatial correlation functions, neglecting the rich information
encoded in their temporal behavior. In this paper we show, using a Hamiltonian
classical-field formalism, that temporal correlations can be used to
characterize familiar properties of a finite-temperature degenerate Bose gas.
The temporal coherence of a Bose-Einstein condensate is limited only by the
slow diffusion of its phase, and thus the presence of a condensate is indicated
by a sharp feature in the temporal power spectrum of the field. We show that
the condensate mode can be obtained by averaging the field for a short time in
an appropriate phase-rotating frame, and that for a wide range of temperatures,
the condensate obtained in this approach agrees well with that defined by the
Penrose-Onsager criterion based on one-body (spatial) correlations. For time
periods long compared to the phase diffusion time, the field will average to
zero, as we would expect from the overall U(1) symmetry of the Hamiltonian. We
identify the emergence of the first moment on short time scales with the
concept of U(1) symmetry breaking that is central to traditional mean-field
theories of Bose condensation. We demonstrate that the short-time averaging
procedure constitutes a general analog of the 'anomalous' averaging operation
of symmetry-broken theories by calculating the anomalous thermal density of the
field, which we find to have form and temperature dependence consistent with
the results of mean-field theories.

enhancing the intertube Josephson tunneling. We also found that T$_c$ is

nanospheres (with radius of few tens nm) is formulated within
random-phase-approximation semiclassical scheme. Spectrum of plasmons is
determined including both surface and volume type excitations. It is
demonstrated that only surface plasmons of dipole type can be excited by
homogeneous dynamical electric field. The Lorentz friction due to irradiation
of electro-magnetic wave by plasmon oscillations is analyzed with respect to
the sphere dimension. The resulting shift of resonance frequency turns out to
be strongly sensitive to the sphere radius. The form of e-m response of the
system of metallic nanospheres embedded in the dielectric medium is found. The
theoretical predictions are verified by a measurement of extinction of light
due to plasmon excitations in nanosphere colloidal water solutions, for Au and
Ag metallic components with radius from 10 to 75 nm. Theoretical predictions
and experiments clearly agree in the positions of surface plasmon resonances
and in an emergence of the first volume plasmon resonance in the e-m response
of the system for limiting big nanosphere radii, when dipole approximation is
not exact.

combinatorial counting of the number of pairs. We also discuss implications for
the production of Monte Carlo configuration for the simulation of nuclear
reactions involving complex nuclei.

plasmon excitations in large metallic nanospheres, with radius range 10-60 nm,
is formulated in an all-analytical version. The spectrum of plasmons is
determined including both surface and volume type excitations and their mutual
connections. The various channels for damping of surface plasmons are evaluated
and the relevant resonance shifts are compared with the experimental data for
metallic nanoparticles of different size located in dielectric medium or on the
semiconductor substrate. The strong enhancement of energy transfer from the
surface plasmon oscillations to the substrate semiconductor is explained in the
regime of a near-field coupling in agreement with recent experimental
observations for metallically nanomodified photo-diode systems.
