accounted for in the context of hidden sectors. Feng, Rajaraman and Tu have
suggested that large (pb to nb) multi-photon or multi-lepton sugnals could be
generated at the LHC through the three-point functions of a
conformally-invariant hidden sector (an ""unparticle"" sector.) Because of the
conformal invariance, the kinematic distributions are calculable. However, the
cross-sections for many such processes grow rapidly with energy, and at some
high scale, to preserve unitarity, conformal invariance must break down.
Requiring that conformal invariance not be broken, and that no signals be
already observed at the Tevatron, we obtain a strong unitarity bound on
multi-photon events at the (10 TeV) LHC. For the model of Feng et al., even
with extremely conservative assumptions, cross-sections must be below 25 fb,
and for operator dimension near 2, well below 1 fb. In more general models,
four-photon signals could still reach cross-sections of a few pb, though bounds
below 200 fb are more typical. Our methods apply to a wide variety of other
processes and settings.

into account the unique characteristics of BSNs in contrast to conventional

prediction-based data transmission approach suitable for BSNs is presented,
which combines a dual prediction framework and a low-complexity prediction

built on the premise that a viable theory must provide a consistent picture of
the dynamics and statics, which are manifested by large increase in shear
viscosity and thermodynamic anamolies respectively. For the static and dynamic
description to be consistent we discovered, using a density functional
description without explicit inclusion of quenched random interactions and a
mean-field theory, that there be an exponentially large number of metastable
states at temperatures less than a critical transition temperature, $T_A$. At a
lower temperature ($T_K < T_A$), which can be associated with the Kauzmann
temperature, the number of glassy states is non-extensive. Based on this theory
we formulated an entropic droplet picture to describe transport in finite
dimensions in the temperature range $T_K < T < T_A$. From the finding that
glasses are trapped in one of many metastable states below $T_A$ we argue that
during the SGT law of large numbers is violated. As a consequence in glasses
there are sub sample to sub sample fluctuations provided the system is observed
for times longer than the typical relaxation time in a liquid. These
considerations, which find support in computer simulations and experiments,
also link the notion of dynamic heterogeneity to the violation of law of large
numbers. Thus, the finding that there is an extensive number of metastable
states in the range $T_K < T < T_A$ offers a coherent explanation of many of
the universal features of glass forming materials.

flow velocities are parallel propagated along the Riemannian space dynamo
action is obtained. Turbulent diffusivity ${\beta}$ is coupled with the Ricci
magnetic curvature, as in Marklund and Clarkson [MNRAS (2005)], GR-MHD dynamo
equation. Mean electric field possesses an extra term due to Ricci tensor
coupling with magnetic vector potential in Ohm's law. Goedel universe induces a
mean field dynamo growth rate ${\gamma}=2{\omega}^{2}{\beta}$. In this frame
kinetic helicity vanishes. By considering a universe vorticity,
${\omega}\approx{10^{-16}s^{-1}}$ for galactic dynamos, thus
${\gamma}=2.10^{-32}{\beta}$, and since ${\beta}\approx{10^{26}cm^{2}s^{-1}}$,
the growth rate ${\gamma}\approx{10^{-6}s^{-1}}$. In non-comoving the magnetic
field is expressed as
$B\approx{\sqrt{\frac{2{\beta}}{\gamma}}{\times}10^{-6}G}\approx{10^{10}G}$ a
magnetic field found in the nucleosynthesis era. The Ricci scalar turbulence
spectrum of the cosmic dynamos is computed from the GR-MHD dynamo equation. By
analyzing the Fourier modes of the Ricci scalar, one shows that the energy
spectrum of the curvature turbulent dynamo is similar to the Kolmogorov

obtained by Brandenburg et al [Phys Rev D (1997)].

present evidence for high degrees of asphericity in the inner cores of three
recent SNe IIP (SNe 2006my, 2006ov, and 2007aa), as revealed by late-time
optical spectropolarimetry. The three objects were all selected to have very
low interstellar polarization (ISP), which minimizes the uncertainties in ISP
removal and allows us to use the continuum polarization as a tracer of
asphericity. The three objects have intrinsic continuum polarizations in the
range of 0.83-1.56% in observations taken after the end of the photometric
plateau, with the polarization dropping to almost zero at the wavelengths of
strong emission lines. Our observations of SN 2007aa at earlier times, taken on
the photometric plateau, show contrastingly smaller continuum polarizations
(~0.1%). The late-time H-alpha and [O I] line profiles of SN 2006ov provide
further evidence for asphericities in the inner ejecta. Such high core
polarizations in very ordinary core-collapse supernovae provide further
evidence that essentially all core-collapse supernova explosions are highly
aspherical, even if the outer parts of the ejecta show only small deviations
from spherical symmetry.

hot spots and 45 knots in the jets of 35 active galactic nuclei are complied
from literature and modeled with single-zone lepton models. It is found that
the observed luminosities at 5 GHz (L_5GHz) and at 1 keV (L_1keV) are tightly
correlated, and the two kinds of sources can be roughly separated with a
division of L_1keV=L_5GHz. Our SED fits show that the mechanisms of the X-rays
are diverse. Considering the sources at rest, the synchrotron-self-Compton
(SSC) scattering would dominate the IC process. This model can interpret the
X-rays of some hot spots with a magnetic field strength (B_ssc^delta=1) being
consistent with the equipartition magnetic field (B_eq^delta=1) in one order of
magnitude, but an unreasonably low B_ssc^delta=1 is required to model the
X-rays for all knots. The ratio R_B=B_eq^delta=1/B_ssc^delta=1 is greater than
1 and it is tightly anti-correlated with ratio R_L= L_1keV/L_5GHz for both the
knots and the hot spots. We propose that the deviation may be due to the
neglect of the relativistic bulk motion for these sources. Considering this
effect, we show that the IC/CMB model well explains the X-ray emission for most
sources. Both B_eq' and delta are tentatively correlated with R_L. Corrected by
the beaming effect, the L'_5GHz-L'_1keV relations for the two kinds of sources
are even tighter than the observed ones. These facts suggest that, under the
equipartition condition, the observational differences of the X-rays from the
knots and hot spots may be mainly due the differences on the Doppler boosting
effect and the co-moving magnetic field of the two kinds of sources. Our IC
scattering models predict a prominent GeV-TeV component in the SEDs for some
sources, which are detectable with H.E.S.S. and Fermi/LAT.

GCs in both their disk and halo components. We find that the GCS formed during
major merging can show strongly rotational kinematics with the maximum
rotational velocities of 140 - 170 km/s for a certain range of orbital
parameters of merging. We also find that a rotating stellar bar, which can be
morphologically identified as a boxy bulge if seen edge-on, can be formed in
models for which the GCSs show strongly rotational kinematics. We thus suggest
that the observed rotational kinematics of GCs with different metallicities in

wellposedness result enables us to show that the solution map is discontinuous
at the origin with respect to the $H^{s} $-topology as soon as $s<-1$. Making

  Review and Suggested Future Directions","26 pages, no figures",,,,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The concept of the Circumstellar Habitable Zone has served the scientific
community well for some decades. It slips easily off the tongue, and it would
be hard to replace. Recently, however, several workers have postulated types of
habitable bodies which might exist outside the classic circumstellar habitable
zone (HZ). These include not only bodies which orbit at substantial distances
from their parent stars, but also snowball worlds with geothermally-maintained
internal oceans and even densely-atmosphered worlds with
geothermally-maintained surface oceans, which have been ejected from unstable
planetary systems into interstellar space. If habitability is not a unique and
diagnostic property of the HZ, then the value of the term has been compromised
in a fundamental way. At the same time, it has become evident that multiple
environmental states, differing in important ways in their habitability, are
possible even for geophysically similar planets subject to similar levels of
insolation, within the classic HZ. We discuss an approach to investigations of
planetary habitability which focuses on planetary-scale ecosystems, which are
here termed - ecospheres. This is following a usage popular amongst ecologists,
such as Huggett (1999), rather than that of authors such as Strughold (1953)
and Dole (1964), who used it as a term for the HZ. This approach emphasizes
ecodynamic perspectives, which explore the dynamic interactions between the
biotic and abiotic factors which together comprise ecosystems.

dark matter (DM) annihilation products. In this work we investigate the
possible effects of such a DM annihilation scenario during the evolution
history of the Universe. We first calculate the extragalactic $\gamma$-ray
background (EGRB), which is produced through the final state radiation of DM
annihilation to charged leptons and the inverse Compton scattering between
electrons/positrons and the cosmic microwave background. The DM halo profile
and the minimal halo mass, which are not yet well determined from the current
N-body simulations, are constrained by the EGRB data from EGRET and Fermi
telescopes. Then we discuss the impact of such leptonic DM models on cosmic
evolution, such as the reionization and heating of intergalactic medium,
neutral Hydrogen 21 cm signal and suppression of structure formation. We show
that the impact on the Hydrogen 21 cm signal might show interesting signatures
of DM annihilation, but the influence on star formation is not remarkable.
Future observations of the 21 cm signals could be used to place new constraints
on the properties of DM.

classifying space of the cobordism category with objects (d-1)-dimensional
manifolds embedded in R^\infty. In this paper we apply the techniques of spaces
of manifolds, as developed by the author and Galatius, to identify the homotopy
type of the cobordism category with objects (d-1)-dimensional submanifolds of a
fixed background manifold M.
  There is a description in terms of a space of sections of a bundle over M
associated to its tangent bundle. This can be interpreted as a form of Poincare
duality, relating a space of submanifolds of M to a space of functions on M.

+26d22', cz ~ 21000 km/s), which exhibits a bimodal distribution of radial
velocities of the containing galaxies. The difference of the subcluster radial
velocities is \Delta V\approx 2900 km/s. We use the results of our photometric
observations made with the 1-m telescope of the Special Astrophysical
Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the spectroscopic and
photometric data from the SDSS DR6 catalog to determine independent distances
to the subclusters via three different methods: the Kormendy relation,
photometric plane, and fundamental plane. We find that the A1775 cluster
consists of two independent clusters, A1775A (cz=19664 km/s) and A1775B
(cz=22576 km/s), each located at its own Hubble distance and having small
peculiar velocities. Given the velocity dispersions of 324 km/s and 581 km/s
and the dynamic masses within the R_200 radius equal to 0.6 10^14 and 3.3 10^14
M_sun, the A1775A and A1775B clusters have the K-band luminosity-to-mass ratios
of 29 and 61, respectively. A radio galaxy with an extended tail belongs to the
A1775B cluster.
