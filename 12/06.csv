used to show how to recover the outcomes found for the alignments of the axes
of these halos in simulations. We also explore the orientation of the angular
momentum of the halos, both with respect to the halo axes and with respect to
the large scale structure. We present an expression which describes well
numerical results for the alignment of the angular momentum of the halo with
respect to the halo axes for randomly chosen halos. We also propose a model
that relates the orientation of the angular momentum with the halos axes
accounting for the orientation of the halo axes with the large scale structure.
This model is shown to recover accurately the observed PDF of the halo angular
momentum with respect to the void radial direction. In addition, we give an
expression for determining the degradation of the angular momentum intrinsic
alignment when observational errors are accounted. This expression is also used
to determine the departure of the observed value of the alignment from the
initial expectation (as provided by the tidal torque theory) due to the
rotation of the angular momentum of the halo with respect to the initial
torque. For voids, we find that the strength of the alignment is reduced to
half the original value. We discuss how to adapt the void results to other
cosmic large scale structures (i.e. filaments, walls, etc).

consistent with thermal emission from plasma having temperatures in the range
of kT=1-8 keV or non-thermal emission having power-law indices in the range of
-1<gamma<3, and X-ray luminosities in the range of Lx~1e32-1e34 erg/s. Several
sources have exhibited X-ray variability of several factors between separate
observations. The X-ray properties are not a ubiquitous feature of single
massive stars but are typical of massive binaries, in which the high-energy
emission is generated by the collision of supersonic winds, or by accretion
onto a compact companion. However, the possibility of intrinsic hard X-ray
generation from single stars cannot be completely ruled out. The spectral
energy distributions of these sources exhibit significant infrared excess,
attributable to free-free emission from ionized stellar winds, supplemented by
hot dust emission in the case of the WC stars. With the exception of one object
located near the outer regions of the Quintuplet cluster, most of the new stars
appear isolated or in loose associations. Seven hydrogen-rich WN and O stars
are concentrated near the Sagittarius B HII region, while other similar stars
and more highly evolved hydrogen-poor WN and WC stars lie scattered within ~50
pc, in projection, of Sagitarrius A West. We discuss various mechanisms capable

~350 open clusters. The final product will be a deep near-IR atlas in five

maps, the VVV variable star survey will enable the construction of a 3-D map of
the surveyed region using well-understood distance indicators such as RR Lyrae
stars, and Cepheids. It will yield important information on the ages of the
populations. The observations will be combined with data from MACHO, OGLE,
EROS, VST, Spitzer, HST, Chandra, INTEGRAL, WISE, Fermi LAT, XMM-Newton, GAIA
and ALMA for a complete understanding of the variable sources in the inner
Milky Way. This public survey will provide data available to the whole
community and therefore will enable further studies of the history of the Milky
Way, its globular cluster evolution, and the population census of the Galactic
Bulge and center, as well as the investigations of the star forming regions in

small wireless network. By applying compressive sensing (CS) at the receive
nodes, the MIMO radar super-resolution can be achieved with far fewer
observations than conventional approaches. This previous work considered the
estimation of direction of arrival and Doppler. Since the targets are sparse in
the angle-velocity space, target information can be extracted by solving an l1
minimization problem. In this paper, the range information is exploited by
introducing step frequency to MIMO radar with CS. The proposed approach is able
to achieve high range resolution and also improve the ambiguous velocity.
However, joint angle-Doppler-range estimation requires discretization of the
angle-Doppler-range space which causes a sharp rise in the computational burden
of the l1 minimization problem. To maintain an acceptable complexity, a
technique is proposed to successively estimate angle, Doppler and range in a
decoupled fashion. The proposed approach can significantly reduce the
complexity without sacrificing performance.

them unexpected, are: (1) The high-excitation fluxes varied systematically and
non-trivially throughout eta Car's 5.5-year spectroscopic cycle. Instead of
rising to a plateau after the 1998 ""event,"" they changed continuously with a
maximum in mid-cycle. (2) At one significant location a brief, strong secondary
maximum occurred just before the 2003.5 spectroscopic event. (3) These emission
lines are strongly concentrated at the ""Weigelt knots"" several hundred AU
northwest of the star. With less certainty, [Ne III] appears to be somewhat
more concentrated than [Fe III]. (4) A faster, blue-shifted component of each
feature appears concentrated near the star and elongated perpendicular to the
system's bipolar axis. This structure may be related to the equatorial outflow
and/or to dense material known to exist along our line of sight to the star.
(5) Using the photoionization program Cloudy, we estimated the range of
parameters for the hot secondary star that would give satisfactory
high-excitation line ratios in the ejecta. Teff = 39000 K and L = 400000 Lsun,
for example, would be satisfactory. The allowed region in parameter space is

mirrored by a coincident rise in the number of galaxies with spheroidal
morphologies. In this paper, however, we show that in detail the correspondence
between galaxy morphology and color is not perfect, providing insight into the
physical origin of this evolution. Using the COSMOS survey, we study a
significant population of red sequence galaxies with disk-like morphologies.
These passive disks typically have Sa-Sb morphological types with large bulges,
but they are not confined to dense environments. They represent nearly one-half
of all red-sequence galaxies and dominate at lower masses (log Mstar < 10)
where they are increasingly disk-dominated. As a function of time, the
abundance of passive disks with log Mstar < 11 increases, but not as fast as
red-sequence spheroidals in the same mass range. At higher mass, the passive
disk population has declined since z~1, likely because they transform into
spheroidals. We estimate that as much as 60% of galaxies transitioning onto the
red sequence evolve through a passive disk phase. The origin of passive disks
therefore has broad implications for understanding how star formation shuts
down. Because passive disks tend to be more bulge-dominated than their
star-forming counterparts, a simple fading of blue disks does not fully explain
their origin. We explore several more sophisticated explanations, including
environmental effects, internal stabilization, and disk regrowth during
gas-rich mergers. While previous work has sought to explain color and
morphological transformations with a single process, these observations open
the way to new insight by highlighting the fact that galaxy evolution may
actually proceed through several separate stages.

the main dc resonance splits into two, and the separation between them is
determined by the coupling strength of the two levels.

theory with many different approaches (Liouville equation based approaches,
nonequilibrium Green's functions techniques, etc.). The collision integrals
turn out to be formally different, but coincide in textbook examples as well as
for systems where the spin-orbit coupling is only a small part of the kinetic
energy like in related studies on the spin Hall effect. In Dirac cone physics
(graphene, surface states of topological insulators like Bi_{1-x}Sb_x, Bi_2Te_3
etc.), where this coupling constitutes the entire kinetic energy, the
difference manifests itself in the precise value of the electron-hole coherence
originated quantum correction to the Drude conductivity $\sim e^2/h * \ell
k_F$. The leading correction is derived analytically for single and multilayer
graphene with general scalar impurities. The often neglected principal value
terms in the collision integral are important. Neglecting them yields a leading
correction of order $(\ell k_F)^{-1}$, whereas including them can give a
correction of order $(\ell k_F)^0$. The latter opens up a counterintuitive
scenario with finite electron-hole coherent effects at Fermi energies
arbitrarily far above the neutrality point regime, for example in the form of a
shift $\sim e^2/h$ that only depends on the dielectric constant. This residual
conductivity, possibly related to the one observed in recent experiments,
depends crucially on the approach and could offer a setting for experimentally
singling out one of the candidates. Concerning the different formalisms we
notice that the discrepancy between a density matrix approach and a Green's
function approach is removed if the Generalized Kadanoff-Baym Ansatz in the
latter is replaced by an anti-ordered version.

$C_p$ defined over $F$. Thus if $V$ is any finite dimensional
$C_p$-representation there are non-negative integers $0\leq n_1,n_2,..., n_k
\leq p-1$ such that $V \cong \oplus_{i=1}^k V_{n_i+1}$. It is also well-known
there is a unique (up to equivalence) $d+1$ dimensional irreducible complex
representation of $\SL_2(\C)$ given by its action on the space $R_d$ of $d$
forms. Here we prove a conjecture, made by R.J. Shank, which reduces the
computation of the ring of $C_p$-invariants $F[ \oplus_{i=1}^k
V_{n_i+1}]^{C_p}$ to the computation of the classical ring of invariants (or
covariants) $\C[R_1 \oplus (\oplus_{i=1}^k R_{n_i})]^{\SL_2(\C)}$. This shows
that the problem of computing modular $C_p$ invariants is equivalent to the
problem of computing classical $\SL_2(\C)$ invariants.
  This allows us to compute for the first time the ring of invariants for many
representations of $C_p$. In particular, we easily obtain from this generators
for the rings of vector invariants $F[m V_2]^{C_p}$, $F[m V_3]^{C_p}$ and $F[m
V_4]^{C_p}$for all $m \in \N$. This is the first computation of the latter two
families of rings of invariants.

Accepted by EPL on the 4th December, 2009","Europhys.Lett.89:19001,2010","10.1209/0295-5075/89/19001",,"astro-ph.CO physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Tajmar effect is an unexplained acceleration observed by accelerometers
and laser gyroscopes close to rotating supercooled rings. The observed ratio
between the gyroscope and ring accelerations was 3+/-1.2x10^-8. Here, a new
model for inertia which has been tested quite successfully on the Pioneer and
flyby anomalies is applied to this problem. The model assumes that the inertia
of the gyroscope is caused by Unruh radiation that appears as the ring and the
fixed stars accelerate relative to it, and that this radiation is subject to a
Hubble-scale Casimir effect. The model predicts that the sudden acceleration of
the nearby ring causes a slight increase in the inertial mass of the gyroscope,
and, to conserve momentum in the reference frame of the spinning Earth, the
gyroscope rotates clockwise with an acceleration ratio of 1.8+/-0.25x10^-8 in
agreement with the observed ratio. However, this model does not explain the
parity violation seen in some of the gyroscope data. To test these ideas the
Tajmar experiment (setup B) could be exactly reproduced in the southern
hemisphere, since the model predicts that the anomalous acceleration should
then be anticlockwise.

efficient, the range of use cases for these technologies widens daily. One
promising area is the integration of XML and data warehouses, where an
XML-native database stores multidimensional data and processes OLAP queries
written in the XQuery interrogation language. This paper explores issues
arising in the implementation of such a data warehouse. We first compare
approaches for multidimensional data modelling in XML, then describe how
typical OLAP queries on these models can be expressed in XQuery. We then show
how, regardless of the model, the grouping features of XQuery 1.1 improve
performance and readability of these queries. Finally, we evaluate the
performance of query evaluation in each modelling choice using the eXist
database, which we extended with a grouping clause implementation.

piecewise flat manifold consisting of this 4-tetrahedron and of the one else
4-tetrahedron identical up to reflection to the present one (call it bisimplex
built on the given 4-simplex, or two-sided 4-simplex). We consider arbitrary
piecewise flat manifold. Gravity action for it can be expressed in terms of sum
of the actions for the bisimplices built on the 4-simplices constituting this
manifold. We use representation of each bisimplex action in terms of rotation
matrices (connections) and area tensors. This gives some representation of any
piecewise flat gravity action in terms of connections. The action is a sum of
terms each depending on the connection variables referring to a single
4-tetrahedron. Application of this representation to the path integral
formalism is considered. Integrations over connections in the path integral
reduce to independent integrations over finite sets of connections on separate
4-simplices. One of the consequences is exponential suppression of the result
at large areas or lengths (compared to Plank scale). It is important for the
consistency of the simplicial description of spacetime.
