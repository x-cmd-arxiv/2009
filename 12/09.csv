from deep near-infrared imaging with the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on board
the Hubble Space Telescope. Accounting for the photometric scatter using
simulations, galaxies at z ~ 7 have bluer UV colors compared to typical local
starburst galaxies at > 4 sigma confidence. Although these colors necessitate
young ages (<100 Myr), low or zero dust attenuation, and low metallicities,
these are explicable by normal (albeit unreddened) stellar populations, with no
evidence for near-zero metallicities and/or top-heavy initial mass functions.
The age of the Universe at these redshifts limits the amount of stellar mass in
late-type populations, and the WFC3 photometry implies galaxy stellar masses ~
10^8 - 10^9 Msol for Salpeter initial mass functions to a limiting magnitude of
M_1500 ~ -18. The masses of ``characteristic'' (L*) z > 7 galaxies are smaller
than those of L* Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at lower redshifts, and are
comparable to less evolved galaxies selected on the basis of their Lyman alpha
emission at 3 < z < 6, implying that the 6.3 < z < 8.6 galaxies are the
progenitors of more evolved galaxies at lower redshifts. We estimate that Lyman
alpha emission is able to contribute to the observed WFC3 colors of galaxies at
these redshifts, with an estimated typical line flux of ~ 10^-18 erg s^-1
cm^-2, roughly a factor of four below currently planned surveys. The integrated
UV specific luminosity for the detected galaxies at z ~ 7 and z ~ 8 is within
factors of a few of that required to reionize the IGM assuming low clumping
factors, implying that in order to reionize the Universe galaxies at these
redshifts have a high ( ~ 50%) escape fraction of Lyman continuum photons,
possibly substantiated by the very blue colors of this population.

conservation law is broken by some non-standard interactions, electron
neutrinos are converted to muon and tau-neutrinos, and electrons - to muons.
This affects the supernova dynamics and the supernova neutrino signal. We
consider lepton flavor violating interactions mediated by scalar bileptons,
i.e. heavy scalars with lepton number 2. It is shown that in case of TeV-mass
bileptons the electron fermi gas is equilibrated with non-electron species
inside the inner supernova core at a time-scale of order of (1-100) ms. In

(1180-1710)A to bring new insight to the composition and energetic processes in
play in the gas nebula around the transiting planetary companion. In that
frame, we consider up-to-date atmospheric models of the giant exoplanet where
we implement non-thermal line broadening to simulate the impact on the transit
absorption of superthermal atoms (HI, OI, and CII) populating the upper layers
of the nebula. Our sensitivity study shows that for all existing models, a
significant line broadening is required for OI and probably for CII lines in
order to fit the observed transit absorptions. In that frame, we show that OI
and CII are preferentially heated compared to the background gas with effective
temperatures as large as T_{OI}/T_B~10 for OI and T_{CII}/T_B~5 for CII. By
contrast, the situation is much less clear for HI because several models could
fit the Lyman-a observations including either thermal HI in an atmosphere that
has a dayside vertical column [HI]~1.05x10^{21} cm^{-2}, or a less extended
thermal atmosphere but with hot HI atoms populating the upper layers of the
nebula. If the energetic HI atoms are either of stellar origin or populations
lost from the planet and energized in the outer layers of the nebula, our
finding is that most models should converge toward one hot population that has
an HI vertical column in the range [HI]_{hot}(2-4)x10^{13} cm^{-2} and an

uncertain, this material most likely accreted from GD 40's circumstellar dust
disk whose existence is demonstrated by excess infrared emission. The data are
best explained by accretion of rocky planetary material, in which heavy

relatively low hydrogen abundance sets an upper limit of 10% water by mass in
the inferred parent body, and the relatively high abundances of refractory

circumstellar disk (''Be phase'') to a state in which all observational
evidence for the presence of these disks disappears (''normal B-star phase'').
We present one of the most comprehensive spectropolarimetric views to date of
such a transition for two Be stars, pi Aquarii and 60 Cygni. 60 Cyg's disk loss
episode was characterized by a monotonic decrease in emission strength over a
time-scale of 1000 days, consistent with the viscous time-scale of the disk,
assuming alpha is 0.14. pi Aqr's disk loss was episodic in nature and occurred
over a time-scale of 2440 days. An observed time lag between the behavior of
the polarization and H-alpha in both stars indicates the disk clearing
proceeded in an ''inside-out'' manner. We determine the position angle of the
intrinsic polarization to be 166.7 +/- 0.1 degrees for pi Aqr and 107.7 +/- 0.4
degrees for 60 Cyg, and model the observed polarization during the quiescent
diskless phase of each star to determine the interstellar polarization along
the line of sight. Minor outbursts observed during the quiescent phase of each
star shared similar lifetimes as those previously reported for mu Cen,
suggesting that the outbursts represent the injection and subsequent viscous
dissipation of individual blobs of material into the inner circumstellar
environments of these stars. We also observe deviations from the mean intrinsic
polarization position angle during polarization outbursts in each star,
indicating deviations from axisymmetry. We propose that these deviations might
be indicative of the injection (and subsequent circularization) of new blobs
into the inner disk, either in the plane of the bulk of the disk material or in
a slightly inclined (non-coplanar) orbit.

physiological processes. A key component of extrinsically activated apoptosis
is the death receptor Fas, which, on binding to its cognate ligand FasL,
oligomerize to form the death-inducing signaling complex. Motivated by recent
experimental data, we propose a mathematical model of death ligand-receptor
dynamics where FasL acts as a clustering agent for Fas, which form locally
stable signaling platforms through proximity-induced receptor interactions.
Significantly, the model exhibits hysteresis, providing an upstream mechanism
for bistability and robustness. At low receptor concentrations, the bistability
is contingent on the trimerism of FasL. Moreover, irreversible bistability,
representing a committed cell death decision, emerges at high concentrations,
which may be achieved through receptor pre-association or localization onto
membrane lipid rafts. Thus, our model provides a novel theory for these
observed biological phenomena within the unified context of bistability.
Importantly, as Fas interactions initiate the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, our
model also suggests a mechanism by which cells may function as bistable
life/death switches independently of any such dynamics in their downstream
components. Our results highlight the role of death receptors in deciding cell
fate and add to the signal processing capabilities attributed to receptor
clustering.

model of the wave type. For example, ""electron"" is described by electronic
field. In contrast to QM, this field is a real physical field and not a field
of probabilities. An important point is that the prequantum field of e.g.
electron contains the irreducible contribution of the background field, vacuum
fluctuations. In principle, the traditional QM-formalism can be considered as a
special regularization procedure: subtraction of averages with respect to
vacuum fluctuations. In this paper we derive a classical analog of the
Heisenberg-Robertson inequality for dispersions of functionals of classical
(prequantum) fields. PCSFT Robertson-like inequality provides a restriction on
the product of classical dispersions. However, this restriction is not so rigid
as in QM. The quantum dispersion corresponds to the difference between e.g. the
electron field dispersion and the dispersion of vacuum fluctuations. Classical
Robertson-like inequality contains these differences. Hence, it does not imply
such a rigid estimate from below for dispersions as it was done in QM.

study evolution of Alfvenic modes in partially ionized astrophysical and space
plasmas. The partially ionized plasma consists mainly of electrons, ions and
significant neutral atoms. The nonlinear interactions amongst these species
take place predominantly through direct collision or charge exchange processes.
Our model uniquely describe the interaction processes between two distinctly
evolving fluids. In our model, the electrons and ions are described by a single
fluid compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model and are coupled
self-consistently to the neutral fluid via compressible hydrodynamic equations.
Both plasma and neutral fluids are treated with different energy equations that
adequately enable us to monitor non adiabatic and thermal energy exchange
processes between these two distinct fluids. Based on our self-consistent
model, we find that the propagation speed of Alfvenic modes in space and
astrophysical plasma is slowed down because these waves are damped
predominantly due to direct collisions with the neutral atoms. Consequently,
energy transfer takes place between plasma and neutral fluids. We describe the
mode coupling processes that lead to the energy transfer between the plasma and

simulate respectively all the other alkali (R+=Li+, Rb+, Cs+) and
alkaline-earth (R'2+=Sr2+, Ba2+) cations present in the complex glass
composition. Moreover, neodymium or lanthanum are used here to simulate all the
rare-earths and actinides occurring in waste solutions. In order to study the
impact of the nature of R+ and R'2+ cations on both glass structure and melt
crystallization tendency during cooling, two glass series were prepared by
replacing either Na+ or Ca2+ cations in the simplified glass by respectively
(Li+, K+, Rb+, Cs+) or (Mg2+, Sr2+, Ba2+) cations. From these substitutions, it
was established that alkali ions are preferentially involved in the charge
compensation of (AlO4)- entities in the glass network comparatively to
alkaline-earth ions. The glass compositions containing calcium give way to the
crystallization of an apatite silicate phase bearing calcium and rare-earth
ions. The melt crystallization tendency during cooling strongly varies with the
nature of the alkaline-earth.

alternative lies in seeking adaptive solutions. This adaptation can be achieved
with self-organization. In a self-organizing transportation system, the

this, when the problem changes the system can adapt by itself to the new

proven to improve traffic flow considerably over traditional methods. In public

mergers. We simulate a series of unequal-mass moderate gas-fraction disc galaxy
mergers. With the resulting g-band images, we determine how the time-scale for
identifying galaxy mergers via projected separation and quantitative morphology
(the Gini coefficient G, asymmetry A, and the second-order moment of the
brightest 20% of the light M20) depends on the merger mass ratio, relative
orientations and orbital parameters. We find that G-M20 is as sensitive to 9:1
baryonic mass ratio mergers as 1:1 mergers, with observability time-scales ~
0.2-0.4 Gyr. In contrast, asymmetry finds mergers with baryonic mass ratios
between 4:1 and 1:1 (assuming local disc galaxy gas-fractions). Asymmetry
time-scales for moderate gas-fraction major disc mergers are ~ 0.2-0.4 Gyr, and
less than 0.06 Gyr for moderate gas-fraction minor mergers. The relative
orientations and orbits have little effect on the time-scales for morphological
disturbances. Observational studies of close pairs often select major mergers
by choosing paired galaxies with similar luminosities and/or stellar masses.
Therefore, the various ways of finding galaxy mergers (G-M20, A, close pairs)
are sensitive to galaxy mergers of different mass ratios. By comparing the
frequency of mergers selected by different techniques, one may place empirical
constraints on the major and minor galaxy merger rates.

Together these new data provide fundamental insights into the mass and
distribution of stars, gas and dust within this archetypal SMG. The CO J=1-0
emission, with its minimal excitation and density requirements, traces the bulk
of the metal-rich molecular gas, and reveals a mass of ~10^11 M(sun), extending
over ~5"" (~25 kpc in the source plane), although there is tentative evidence
that it may be significantly larger. Our data suggest that three or more
distinct structures are encompassed by this molecular gas reservoir, including
the BAL quasar from which the redshift of the SMG was initially determined. In
particular, the new rest-frame near-IR observations identify a massive,
obscured, starburst coincident with a previously known Ly-alpha cloud. This
starburst dominates the far-IR emission from the system and requires a
re-assessment of previous claims that the gas reservoir resides in a massive,
extended disk around the BAL QSO. Instead it appears that SMM J02399-0136
comprises a merger between a far-IR-luminous, but highly obscured starburst,
the BAL QSO host and a faint third component. Our findings suggest that this
SMG and its immediate environment mark a vast and complex galactic nursery and
that detailed studies of other SMGs are likely to uncover a similarly rich
diversity of properties.

evolution with redshift observed in the fraction of asymmetric galaxies may
reflect evolution in the gas properties of galaxies rather than the global

the interstellar medium. However, the effects of their immersion in a hot
(post-shock) gas have never before been fully investigated. Aims: We study the
effects of energetic ion and electron collisions on PAHs in the hot post-shock
gas behind interstellar shock waves. Methods: We calculate the ion-PAH and
electron-PAH nuclear and electronic interactions, above the carbon atom loss
threshold, in H II regions and in the hot post-shock gas, for temperatures
ranging from 10^3 to 10^8 K. Results: PAH destruction is dominated by He
collisions at low temperatures (T < 3x10^4 K), and by electron collisions at
higher temperatures. Smaller PAHs are destroyed faster for T < 10^6 K, but the
destruction rates are roughly the same for all PAHs at higher temperatures. The
PAH lifetime in a tenuous hot gas (n_H ~ 0.01 cm^-3, T ~ 10^7 K), typical of
the coronal gas in galactic outflows, is found to be about thousand years,
orders of magnitude shorter than the typical lifetime of such objects.
Conclusions: In a hot gas, PAHs are principally destroyed by electron
collisions and not by the absorption of X-ray photons from the hot gas. The
resulting erosion of PAHs occurs via C_2 loss from the periphery of the
molecule, thus preserving the aromatic structure. The observation of PAH
emission from a million degree, or more, gas is only possible if the emitting
PAHs are ablated from dense, entrained clumps that have not yet been exposed to
the full effect of the hot gas.

proper motion, ensuring that the neighboring bodies lie at the same distance,
rather than relying on the statistical improbability that two objects in close

galaxies have been ro- bustly detected in CO rotational transitions, either
12CO(J=4-3) or 12CO(J=3-2), allowing their sizes and gas masses to be
accurately constrained. These are the highest spatial resolution observations
observed to date (by a factor of ~2) for intermediate-excitation CO emission in
z~2 ULIRGs. The galaxies appear extended over several resolution elements,
having a mean radius of 3.7 kpc. High-resolution (0.3"") combined MERLIN-VLA
observations of their radio continua allow an analysis of the star formation
behaviour of these galaxies, on comparable spatial scales to that of the CO
observations. This 'matched beam' approach sheds light on the spatial
distribution of both molecular gas and star formation, and we can therefore
calculate accurate star formation rates and gas surface densities: this allows
us to place the three systems in the context of a Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS)-style
star formation law. We find a difference in size between the CO and radio
emission regions, and as such we suggest that using the spatial extent of the
CO emission region to estimate the surface density of star formation may lead
to error. This size difference also causes the star formation efficiencies
within systems to vary by up to a factor of 5. We also find, with our new
accurate sizes, that SMGs lie significantly above the KS relation, indicating
that stars are formed more efficiently in these extreme systems than in other
high-z star forming galaxies.

that is gathering high quality HI-line spectra using the Arecibo radio
telescope for an unbiased sample of ~1000 galaxies with stellar masses greater
than 10^10 Msun and redshifts 0.025<z<0.05, selected from the SDSS
spectroscopic and GALEX imaging surveys. The galaxies are observed until
detected or until a low gas mass fraction limit (1.5-5%) is reached. This paper
presents the first Data Release, consisting of ~20% of the final GASS sample.
We use this data set to explore the main scaling relations of HI gas fraction
with galaxy structure and NUV-r colour. A large fraction (~60%) of the galaxies
in our sample are detected in HI. We find that the atomic gas fraction
decreases strongly with stellar mass, stellar surface mass density and NUV-r
colour, but is only weakly correlated with galaxy bulge-to-disk ratio (as
measured by the concentration index of the r-band light). We also find that the
fraction of galaxies with significant (more than a few percent) HI decreases
sharply above a characteristic stellar surface mass density of 10^8.5 Msun
kpc^-2. The fraction of gas-rich galaxies decreases much more smoothly with
stellar mass. One of the key goals of GASS is to identify and quantify the
incidence of galaxies that are transitioning between the blue, star-forming
cloud and the red sequence of passively-evolving galaxies. Likely transition
candidates can be identified as outliers from the mean scaling relations
between gas fraction and other galaxy properties. [abridged]

lenses with high transverse velocities. Furthermore, for any given lens mass
and speed, events of short duration are preferentially caused by nearby lenses
(mesolenses) that can be studied in detail, or else by lenses so close to the
source star that finite-source-size effects may be detected, yielding
information about both the Einstein ring radius and the surface of the lensed
star. Planets causing short-duration events may be in orbits with any
orientation, and may have semimajor axes smaller than an AU, or they may reach
the outer limits of their planetary systems, in the region corresponding to the
Solar System's Oort Cloud. They can have masses larger than Jupiter's or
smaller than Pluto's. Lensing therefore has a unique potential to expand our
understanding of planetary systems. A particular advantage of lensing is that
it can provide precision measurements of system parameters, including the
masses of and projected separation between star and planet. We demonstrate how
the parameters can be extracted and show that a great deal can be learned. For
example, it is remarkable that the gravitational mass of nearby free-floating
planet-mass lenses can be measured by complementing observations of a
photometric event with deep images that detect the planet itself. A fraction of
short events may be caused by high-velocity stars located within a kpc. Many
high-velocity lenses are likely to be neutron stars that received large natal
kicks. Other high-speed stars may be members of the halo population. Still
others may be hypervelocity stars that have been ejected from the Galactic
Center, or runaway stars escaped from close binaries, possibly including the
progenitor binaries of Type Ia supernovae.

flat LambdaCDM paradigm. Dark-energy and curvature scenarios, and primordial
perturbation models are considered. To that end, we calculate the Bayesian
evidence in favour of each model using Population Monte Carlo (PMC), a new
adaptive sampling technique which was recently applied in a cosmological
context. The Bayesian evidence is immediately available from the PMC sample
used for parameter estimation without further computational effort, and it
comes with an associated error evaluation. Besides, it provides an unbiased
estimator of the evidence after any fixed number of iterations and it is
naturally parallelizable, in contrast with MCMC and nested sampling methods. By
comparison with analytical predictions for simulated data, we show that our
results obtained with PMC are reliable and robust. The variability in the
evidence evaluation and the stability for various cases are estimated both from
simulations and from data. For the cases we consider, the log-evidence is
calculated with a precision of better than 0.08.
  Using a combined set of recent CMB, SNIa and BAO data, we find inconclusive
evidence between flat LambdaCDM and simple dark-energy models. A curved
Universe is moderately to strongly disfavoured with respect to a flat
cosmology. Using physically well-motivated priors within the slow-roll
approximation of inflation, we find a weak preference for a running spectral
index. A Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum is weakly disfavoured. With the current
data, tensor modes are not detected; the large prior volume on the
tensor-to-scalar ratio r results in moderate evidence in favour of r=0.

stochastic backgrounds of gravitational waves. We estimate the amplitude of
this signal for the primordial inflationary background, gravitational waves
generated during preheating, and for gravitational waves produced by
self-ordering scalar fields following a global phase transition. To assess
detectability, we describe how to extract the 3-pt signal from an idealized
interferometric experiment and compute the signal to noise ratio as a function
of integration time. The 3-pt signal for the stochastic gravitational wave
background generated by inflation is unsurprisingly tiny. For gravitational
radiation generated by purely causal, classical mechanisms we find that, no
matter how non-linear the process is, the 3-pt correlations produced vanish in
direct detection experiments. On the other hand, we show that in scenarios
where the B-mode of the CMB is sourced by gravitational waves generated by a
global phase transition, a strong 3-pt signal among the polarization modes
could also be produced. This may provide another method of distinguishing
inflationary B-modes. To carry out this computation, we have developed a
diagrammatic approach to the calculation of stochastic gravitational waves
sourced by scalar fluids, which has applications beyond the present scenario.

of Kaluza-Klein (KK) gluons and photons, the W^+- and Z^0 bosons and their KK

potential new-physics effects in neutral-meson mixing and in rare decays of
kaons and B mesons, including both inclusive and exclusive processes. We find
that while the predictions for \Delta(F)=2 observables are rather
model-independent, \Delta(F)=1 processes depend sensitively on the exact
realizations of the electroweak gauge and the fermionic sector. In this
context, we emphasize that the localization of the right-handed top quark in

distribution is expected from (1) the angular correlation function when applied
to our survey and ~2500 colour-selected LBGs from the literature and (2) an
analysis of a carefully matched high-resolution hybrid numerical and analytical
cosmological simulation. Because the spectroscopic slitlets have random
orientations with respect to the close pairs on the sky, the serendipitous
pairs provide an unbiased sampling of the underlying close pair fraction.
Finally, we discover two Ly-a emitters (LAEs) in our slitlets and find that
they reside within 50 projected h^-1 kpc of LBGs. In this work, we uncover a
strong relationship between Ly-a emission and pair separation. All confirmed
and all candidate LBG pairs with separations of < 15 projected h^-1 kpc exhibit
Ly-a in emission and we find an overabundance of Ly-a emission in pairs with <
50 projected h^-1 kpc separations. This relationship suggests a picture in
which a measurable fraction of the Ly-a emission of LBGs, and potentially LAEs,
is generated via interaction mechanisms. As a result, serendipitous

high-redshift galaxy interactions using conventional ground-based optical data.

whereas for a HSB gas with hard sphere diameter $a_{h.s.}=x_{node}$, the HSB
wave function vanishes when all $|x_{12}|<a_{h.s.}$. Arguments are given
suggesting that the same theorem holds also for $N>2$. The sTG and HSB wave
functions for N=2 are given exactly in terms of a parabolic cylinder function,
and for $N\ge 2$, $x_{node}$ is given accurately by a simple parabola. The
metastability of the sTG phase generated by a sudden change of the coupling

transiting-planet host stars is to match theoretical models to observations of
the stellar mean density rho_*, the effective temperature T_eff, and the
composition parameter [Z]. This explicitly model-dependent approach is based on
readily-available observations, and results in small formal errors. Here I use
two calibration samples of stars (eclipsing binaries and stars for which
asteroseismic analyses are available) having well-determined masses and radii
to estimate the accuracy and systematic errors inherent in the rho_* method.
When matching to the Yonsei-Yale stellar evolution models, I find the most
important systematic error results from selection bias favoring
rapidly-rotating (hence probably magnetically active) stars among the eclipsing
binary sample. If unaccounted for, this bias leads to a mass-dependent
underestimate of stellar radii by as much as 4% for stars of 0.4 M_sun,
decreasing to zero for masses above about 1.4 M_sun. The asteroseismic sample
suggests (albeit with significant uncertainty) that systematic errors are small
for slowly-rotating, inactive stars. Systematic errors arising from failings of
the Yonsei-Yale models of inactive stars probably exist, but are difficult to
assess because of the small number of well-characterized comparison stars
having low mass and slow rotation. Poor information about [Z] is an important
source of random error, and may be a minor source of systematic error as well.
With suitable corrections for rotation, it is likely that systematic errors in
the rho_* method can be comparable to or smaller than the random errors,
yielding radii that are accurate to about 2% for most stars.

developed in \cite{Avsar:2009xf} to find an explicit expression for the
scattered field, we are able to show that the scattered field can be written in
terms of time-like and space-like vacuum states where the time-like states are
identified with the outgoing particles. To support this picture, we calculate
the contribution of the time-like modes to the energy-momentum tensor of the
scattered field and show that the energy flow in the fifth dimension is
directly related to the imaginary part of the action. The energy flow in the
fifth dimension is also compared to the incoming energy flow to determine which
fraction of the initial energy goes to the produced particles. The last two
sections are devoted to localize the energy flow in momentum and coordinate
space, first by finding the virtualities that contribute the most to the total
flow, and second by finding an approximate trajectory in coordinate space.

usual divisory lines between Star Forming (SF) and AGN hosts, and between
Seyferts and LINERs to diagrams that are more economical in terms of line
quality requirements. By doing this, we rescue from the classification limbo a
substantial number of sources and modify the global census of ELGs. More
specifically: (1) We use the SDSS DR7 to constitute a suitable sample of 280k
ELGs, 1/3 of which are WLGs. (2) Galaxies with strong emission lines are
classified using the widely applied criteria of Kewley et al (2001), Kauffmann
et al (2003), Stasinska et al (2006) and Kewley et al (2006). (3) We transpose
these classification schemes to alternative diagrams keeping [NII]/Ha as a
horizontal axis, but replacing Hb by a stronger line (Ha or [OII]), or
substituting [OIII]/Hb ratio with the equivalent width of Ha. Optimized
equations for the transposed divisory lines are provided. (4) We show that
nothing significant is lost in the translation, but that the new diagrams allow
one to classify up to 50% more ELGs. (5) Introducing WLGs in the census of

multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) channel into parallel
single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO) channels with zero inter-user interference (IUI). In
this paper, we combine the BD technique with two deterministic vector
perturbation (VP) algorithms that reduce the transmit power in MU-MIMO systems
with linear precoding. These techniques are the fixed-complexity sphere encoder
(FSE) and the QR-decomposition with M-algorithm encoder (QRDM-E). In contrast
to the conventional BD VP technique, which is based on the sphere encoder (SE),
the proposed techniques have fixed complexity and a tradeoff between
performance and complexity can be achieved by controlling the size of the set
of candidates for the perturbation vector. Simulation results and analysis
demonstrate the properness of the proposed techniques for the next generation
mobile communications systems which are latency and computational complexity
limited. In MU-MIMO system with 4 users each equipped with 2 receive antennas,
simulation results show that the proposed BD-FSE and BD-QRDM-E outperforms the
conventional BD-THP (Tomlinson Harashima precoding) by 5.5 and 7.4dB,

conditioned on a continuous time random walk Y on Z^d with jump rate \rho>0,

random walk X with jump rate 1 is Gibbs transformed with weight e^{\beta
L_t(X,Y)}, where L_t(X,Y) is the collision local time between X and Y up to
time t. As the inverse temperature \beta varies, the model undergoes a
localization-delocalization transition at some critical \beta_c>=0. A natural
question is whether or not there is disorder relevance, namely whether or not
\beta_c differs from the critical point \beta_c^{ann} for the annealed model.
In Birkner and Sun [BS09], it was shown that there is disorder irrelevance in
dimensions d=1 and 2, and disorder relevance in d>=4. For d>=5, disorder
relevance was first proved by Birkner, Greven and den Hollander [BGdH08]. In
this paper, we prove that if X and Y have the same jump probability kernel,
which is irreducible and symmetric with finite second moments, then there is
also disorder relevance in the critical dimension d=3, and
\beta_c-\beta^{ann}_c is at least of the order e^{-C(\zeta)\rho^{-\zeta}},
C(\zeta)>0, for any \zeta>2. Our proof employs coarse graining and fractional
moment techniques, which have recently been applied by Lacoin [L09] to the
directed polymer model in random environment, and by Giacomin, Lacoin and
Toninelli [GLT09] to establish disorder relevance for the random pinning model

disk-magnetosphere interaction is small, and the time-scale of spin evolution,
2 x10^7-10^9 years is longer than the 2x10^6 years age of V2129 Oph. The
external magnetic flux of the star is strongly influenced by the disk: the
field lines connecting the disk and the star inflate and form magnetic towers
above and below the disk. The potential (vacuum) approximation is still valid
inside the Alfv\'en (magnetospheric) surface where the magnetic stress
dominates over the matter stress.

  Semiconductor transport characteristics",,,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Electron transfer processes at molecule-semiconductor interfaces involve a
complex mixture of thermionic, tunneling and hopping events. Traditionally
these processes have been modeled in a piece-meal fashion, relying on
phenomenological treatments such as Simmons and Richardson equations that are
not vetted in atomistic systems and do not flow seamlessly into each other. We
present a unified modeling approach, based on the Non-equilibrium Greens
function (NEGF) formalism that allows us to integrate diverse transport regimes
and establish a comprehensive quantitative theory. By comparing our simulations
with experiments on a metal-molecule-semiconductor junction (varying molecular
lengths ~1-3nm), we identify the role of molecular monolayers in tuning the
semiconductor band-bending, and thereby overall device conductivity. We find
that the principal role of molecules is to act as a voltage divider, altering
the Schottky barriers, thereby modulating current levels, voltage-asymmetries
and crossover from Schottky to tunneling transport. While this provides an
appealingly simple explanation for our observed experimental trends, the
calculated shifts in crossover voltages are insufficient to explain the
experiments quantitatively. Quantitative correspondence with experiments
requires invocation of an additional voltage divider arising from molecular
dipoles that further tunes semiconductor band-bending. The extracted dipole
moments are rationalized using ab-initio calculations for each molecule,
along-with a dilution of packing fraction for the shortest molecular lengths.
The methodology described herein can be used to better understand and predict
transport characteristics of such junctions.

background and are supported against collapse by a conical singularity in the
form of a disk. An interesting feature of these solutions is that the
Gauss-Bonnet term reduces the conical excess of the static black rings.
Analogous to the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet black strings, for a given mass the
static black rings exist up to a maximal value of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling
constant $\alpha'$. Moreover, in the limit of large ring radius, the suitably

kinematics of the GC system. The NGC 4636 GC system shows weak overall
rotation, which is dominated by the red GCs. However, both the blue GCs and red
GCs show some rotation in the inner region at R<4.3'. The velocity dispersion
for all the GCs is derived to be sigma_p = 225{+12-9} km/s. The velocity
dispersion for the blue GCs (sig=251 km/s) is slightly larger than that for the
red GCs (sig=205 km/s). The velocity dispersions for the blue GCs about the
mean velocity and about the best fit rotation curve have a significant
variation depending on the galactocentric radius. Comparison of observed
stellar and GC velocity dispersion profiles with the velocity dispersion
profiles calculated from the stellar mass profile shows that the mass-to-light
ratio should increase as the galactocentric distance increases, indicating the
existence of an extended dark matter halo. From the comparison of the observed
GC velocity dispersion profiles and the velocity dispersion profiles calculated
for the X-ray mass profiles in the literature, we find that the orbit of the GC
system is tangential, and that the orbit of the red GCs is slightly more
tangential than that of the blue GCs. We compare the GC kinematics of NGC 4636

are diverse among gEs. We find several correlations between the kinematics of

the Supergiant Fast X-ray Transient (SFXT) IGR J18483-0311 in quiescence. The
18-60 keV hard X-ray behaviour of the source is presented here for the first
time, it is characterized by a spectral shape ($\Gamma$ about 2.5) similar to
that during outburst activity and the lowest measured luminosity level is about
10^34 erg s^-1. The 0.5-10 keV luminosity state, measured by XMM-Newton during
the apastron passage, is about one order of magnitude lower and it is
reasonably fitted by an absorbed black body model yielding parameters
consistent with previous measurements. In addition, we find evidence (about 3.5
sigma significance) of an emission-like feature at about 3.3 keV in the
quiescent 0.5-10 keV source spectrum. The absence of any known or found
systematic effects, which could artificially introduce the observed feature,
give us confidence about its non-instrumental nature. We show that its physical
explanation in terms of atomic emission line appears unlikely and conversely we
attempt to ascribe it to an electron cyclotron emission line which would imply
a neutron star magnetic field of the order of about 3x10^11 G. Importantly,
such direct estimation is in very good agreement with that independently
inferred by us in the framework of accretion from a spherically symmetric
stellar wind. If firmly confirmed by future longer X-ray observations, this
would be the first detection ever of a cyclotron feature in the X-ray spectrum
of a SFXT, with important implications on theoretical models.

elongation of droplets, for destabilization of interfaces between two liquids,

star clusters or non-clusters (basically, nebular complexes and their stellar
associations). The radius distribution functions follow power-laws
($dN/dR\propto R^{-\alpha}$) with slopes and maximum radius ($R_{max}$) that
depend on object class (and age). Non-clusters are characterised by
$\alpha\approx1.9$ and $R_{max}\la472$ pc, while young clusters (age $\la10$
Myr) have $\alpha\approx3.6$ and $R_{max}\la15$ pc, and old ones (age $\ga600$
Myr) have $\alpha\approx2.5$ and $R_{max}\la40$ pc. Young clusters present a
high degree of spatial self-correlation and, especially, correlate with
star-forming structures, which does not occur with the old ones. This is
consistent with the old clusters having been heavily mixed up, since their ages
correspond to several LMC and SMC crossing times. On the other hand, with ages
corresponding to fractions of the respective crossing times, the young clusters
still trace most of their birthplace structural pattern. Also, small clusters
($R<10$ pc), as well as small non-clusters ($R<100$ pc), are spatially
self-correlated, while their large counterparts of both classes are not. The

surface diffusion, hence this is the asymptotic behavior of the
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation as conjectured by field theory in two dimensions,

added to a KPZ process we observe smooth surfaces with logarithmic growth,

compression can be used to adjust potential energy for transverse displacements
from harmonic to double well regime. As compressional strain is increased to
the buckling instability, the frequency of fundamental vibrational mode drops
continuously to zero (first buckling instability). As one tunes the separation
between ends of a rod, the system remains stable beyond the instability and
develops a double well potential for transverse motion. The two minima in
potential energy curve describe two possible buckled states at a particular
strain. From one buckled state it can go over to the other by thermal
fluctuations or quantum tunnelling. Using a continuum approach and transition
state theory (TST) one can calculate the rate of conversion from one state to
other. Saddle point for the change from one state to other is the straight rod
configuration. The rate, however, diverges at the second buckling instability.
At this point, the straight rod configuration, which was a saddle till then,
becomes hill top and two new saddles are generated. The new saddles have bent
configurations and as rod goes through further instabilities, they remain
stable and the rate calculated according to harmonic approximation around
saddle point remains finite. In our earlier paper classical rate calculation
including friction has been carried out [J. Comput. Theor. Nanosci. {\bf 4}
(2007) {\it 1}], by assuming that each segment of the rod is coupled to its own
collection of harmonic oscillators - our rate expression is well behaved
through the second buckling instability. In this paper we have extended our
method to calculate quantum rate using the same system plus reservoir model. We
find that friction lowers the rate of conversion.

correlation between the density \rho(r) and the velocity dispersion
\sigma^2_r(r) expressed by the powerlaw behavior of the DM `entropy' K=
\sigma_r^2/\rho^{2/3} ~ r^\alpha with \alpha ~ 1.25-1.3. Indicated (among
others) by several recent N-body simulations, this correlation is privileged by
the form of the radial pressure term in the Jeans equation, and yields a main
body profile consistent with the classic self-similar development of DM halos.
In addition, we require the Jeans solutions to satisfy regular boundary
conditions both at the center (finite pressure, round gravitational potential)
and in the outskirts (finite overall mass). With these building blocks we
derive physical solutions, dubbed `\alpha-profiles'. We find the one with
\alpha=1.25, suitable for the Galaxy halo, to be intrinsically flatter at the
center relative to the empirical NFW formula, yet steeper than the empirical
Einasto profile. So on scales of 10^{-1} deg it yields annihilation fluxes
lower by a factor 5 than the former yet higher by a factor 10 than the latter;
such fluxes will eventually fall within the reach of the Fermi satellite. We
show the effectiveness of the \alpha-profile in relieving the astrophysical
uncertainties related to the macroscopic DM distribution, and discuss its
expected performance as a tool instrumental to interpret the upcoming gamma-ray
data in terms of DM annihilation.

  This research aims to increase understanding of why people tag and how
effective they find it for searching, using as the focus. Open-ended
questionnaires were sent out to members of the photo-sharing website Flickr,
with the opportunity to post comments to an online discussion space. There is
also a systematic comparison between a tag-based system and a more traditional
controlled vocabulary, to test out the claims made regarding the suitability of
tagging for searching and browsing. For this purpose Flickr has been compared

  The small number of people who replied to the questionnaire gave detailed
answers that confirmed several assertions made about tags: they are accepted
despite their flaws (sloppiness and potential for inaccuracy) because they
serve their purpose to a satisfactory level. Some answers challenged the
assumption that tagging is only done for personal benefit. The search
comparison found that while Getty allows highly specific queries and logical
semantic links, Flickr is more flexible and better placed to deal with subtle
concepts. The overall conclusion is that tags achieve most when used in

replacement for words to allow the deaf to communicate. Previous work has shown
that although it takes longer to make signs than to say the equivalent words,
on average sentences can be completed in about the same time. This leaves
unresolved, however, precisely why that should be the case. This paper reports
a determination of the empirical entropy and redundancy in the set of
handshapes of ASL. In this context, the entropy refers to the average
information content in a unit of data. It is found that the handshapes, as
fundamental units of ASL, are less redundant than phonemes, the equivalent
fundamental units of spoken English, and that their entropy is much closer to
the maximum possible information content. This explains why the slower signs
can produce sentences in the same time as speaking; the low redundancy
compensates for the slow rate of sign production. In addition to this precise
quantification, this work is also novel in its approach towards quantifying an
aspect of the ASL alphabet. Unlike spoken and written languages, frequency
analysis of ASL is difficult due to the fact that every sign is composed of
phonemes that are created through a combination of manual and a relatively
large and imprecise set of bodily features. Focusing on handshapes as the
ubiquitous and universal feature of all sign languages permits a precise
quantitative analysis. As interest in visual electronic communication explodes
within the deaf community, this work also paves the way for more precise

  The correlation functions correspond to steady-state solutions of the von
Karman-Howarth equation under the self-similarity hypothesis introduced by von
Karman. These solutions are numerically determined with the statistics of
velocity difference. The obtained results adequately describe the several
properties of the fully developed isotropic turbulence.

magnetic dipoles. All dipoles are randomly placed on a fraction x of all L^3
sites of a simple cubic lattice, and point along a given crystalline axis. For
x_c< x<=1, where x_c = 0.65, we find an antiferromagnetic phase below a
temperature which vanishes as x tends to x_c from above. At lower values of x,
we find an equilibrium spin-glass (SG) phase below a temperature given by k_B
T_{sg} = x e_d, where e_d is a nearest neighbor dipole-dipole interaction
energy. We study (a) the relative mean square deviation D_q^2 of |q|, where q
is the SG overlap parameter, and (b) xi_L/L, where xi_L is a correlation
length. From their variation with temperature and system size, we determine
T_{sg}. In the SG phase, we find (i) the mean values <|q|> and <q^2> decrease
algebraically with L as L increases, (ii) double peaked, but wide,
distributions of q/<|q|> appear to be independent of L, and (iii) xi_L/L rises
with L at constant T, but extrapolations to 1/L -> 0 give finite values. All of
this is consistent with quasi-long-range order in the SG phase.

simulations of astrophysical objects, which is based in the damping of fluid
oscillations. We apply the method to general relativistic hydrodynamic
simulations using a spherical coordinates. We perform 1D-spherical and 2D-
axisymmetric simulations of radial oscillations in spherical systems. We
calibrate first the method with simulations with added bulk viscosity and study
the differences between different numerical schemes. We apply the method to
radial oscillations of neutron stars and we conclude that the main source of
numerical viscosity in this case is the surface of the star. We expect that
this method could be useful to compute the resolution requirements and
limitations of the numerical simulations in different astrophysical scenarios
in the future.

computation and computational complexity. However, proving lower bounds and
necessary conditions remains hard in most of the cases. In this article, we
introduce necessary conditions for a cellular automaton to be ""universal"",
according to a precise notion of simulation, related both to the dynamics of
cellular automata and to their computational power. This notion of simulation
relies on simple operations of space-time rescaling and it is intrinsic to the
model of cellular automata. Intrinsinc universality, the derived notion, is
stronger than Turing universality, but more uniform, and easier to define and
study. Our approach builds upon the notion of communication complexity, which
was primarily designed to study parallel programs, and thus is, as we show in
this article, particulary well suited to the study of cellular automata: it
allowed to show, by studying natural problems on the dynamics of cellular
automata, that several classes of cellular automata, as well as many natural
(elementary) examples, could not be intrinsically universal.

Furthermore, we introduce a residue-type generating function for the weight
