Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) at an estimated photometric distance of ~85kpc.
We measure radial velocities for 8 RR Lyrae stars within Pisces. We find that 5
of the 8 stars have heliocentric radial velocities within a narrow range of -87
km/s < v < -67 km/s, suggesting that the photometric overdensity is mainly due
to a physically associated system, probably a dwarf galaxy or a disrupted
galaxy. Two of the remaining 3 stars differ from one another by only 9 km/s,
but it would be premature to identify them as a second system.

bound state of two different particles is used to elucidate relativistic
aspects of electromagnetic form factors. The model form factor is computed
using an exact covariant calculation of the lowest-order triangle diagram and
shown to be the same as that obtained using light-front techniques. The meaning
of transverse density is explained using coordinate space variables, allowing
us to identify a true mean-square transverse size directly related to the form
factor. We show that the rest-frame charge distribution is generally not
observable because of the failure to uphold current conservation. Neutral
systems of two charged constituents are shown to obey the lore that the heavier
one is generally closer to the transverse origin than the lighter one. It is
argued that the negative central charge density of the neutron arises, in
pion-cloud models, from pions of high longitudinal momentum. The
non-relativistic limit is defined precisely and the ratio of the binding energy
to that of the mass of the lightest constituent is shown to govern the
influence of relativistic effects. The exact relativistic formula for the form
factor reduces to the familiar one of the three-dimensional Fourier transform
of a square of a wave function for a very limited range of parameters. For
masses that mimic the quark-di-quark model of the nucleon we find substantial
relativistic corrections for any value of $Q^2$. A schematic model of the
lowest s-states of nuclei is used to find that relativistic effects decrease
the form factor for light nuclei but increase the form factor for heavy nuclei.
Furthermore, these states are strongly influenced by relativity.

continuum, which interact via an action principle as previously considered in a
discrete space-time. The model is defined by specifying the vacuum as a sum of
Dirac seas corresponding to several generations of elementary particles. The
only free parameters entering the model are the fermion masses. We find
dynamical field equations if and only if the number of generations equals
three. In this case, the dynamics is described by a massive axial potential
coupled to the Dirac spinors. The coupling constant and the rest mass of the
axial field depend on the regularization; for a given regularization method
they can be computed as functions of the fermion masses. The bosonic mass term
arises as a consequence of a symmetry breaking effect, giving an alternative to
the Higgs mechanism. In addition to the standard loop corrections of quantum
field theory, we find new types of correction terms to the field equations
which violate causality. These non-causal corrections are too small for giving
obvious contradictions to physical observations, but they might open the
possibility to test the approach in future experiments.

perturbative quantum field theory is concerned, whether a parity anomaly owing

renormalization method independent of any regularization scheme. Such a problem
has been investigated in the framework of BPHZL renormalization method, by
adopting the Lowenstein-Zimmermann subtraction scheme. The 1-loop parity-odd
contribution to the vacuum-polarization tensor is explicitly computed in the
framework of the BPHZL renormalization method. It is shown that a Chern-Simons
term is generated at that order induced through the infrared subtractions --
which violate parity. We show then that, what is called parity anomaly, is in

eccentric orbits that typically result from scattering interactions. It will
thus be important to determine more precisely the current orbital eccentricity
by further high-precision radial velocity measurements or by timing the

Investment funds use what is perhaps the most basic financial strategy, called
""value investing"", i.e. systematically attempting to buy underpriced assets.
When funds do not borrow, the price fluctuations of the asset are normally
distributed and uncorrelated across time. All this changes when the funds are
allowed to leverage, i.e. borrow from a bank, to purchase more assets than
their wealth would otherwise permit. During good times competition drives
investors to funds that use more leverage, because they have higher profits. As
leverage increases price fluctuations become heavy tailed and display clustered
volatility, similar to what is observed in real markets. Previous explanations
of fat tails and clustered volatility depended on ""irrational behavior"", such
as trend following. Here instead this comes from the fact that leverage limits
cause funds to sell into a falling market: A prudent bank makes itself locally
safer by putting a limit to leverage, so when a fund exceeds its leverage
limit, it must partially repay its loan by selling the asset. Unfortunately
this sometimes happens to all the funds simultaneously when the price is
already falling. The resulting nonlinear feedback amplifies large downward
price movements. At the extreme this causes crashes, but the effect is seen at
every time scale, producing a power law of price disturbances. A standard
(supposedly more sophisticated) risk control policy in which individual banks
base leverage limits on volatility causes leverage to rise during periods of
low volatility, and to contract more quickly when volatility gets high, making
these extreme fluctuations even worse.

We show that dust-dust collisional charging becomes an important process in
determining the charge state of dust and gas, if there is dust enhancement
and/or dust is fluffy, so that dust surface area per disc volume is locally
increased.
  We solve the charge equilibrium equations for various disc environments and
dust number density $\eta$, using general purpose graphic processors (GPGPU)
and {\sc cuda} programming language. We found that as dust number density
$\eta$ increases, the charge distribution experience four phases. In one of
these phases the electrostatic field $E$ caused by dust motion increases as $E
\propto \eta^4$. As a result, macroscopic electric discharge takes place, for
example at $\eta = 70$ (in units of minimum-mass solar nebula (MMSN) values,
considering two groups of fluffy dust with radii $10^{-2}\unit{cm}$,
$10^{2}\unit{cm}$). We present a model that describes the charge exchange
processes in the discs as an electric circuit. We derive analytical formulae of
critical dust number density for lightning, as functions of dust parameters.
  We estimate the total energy, intensity and event ratio of such discharges
(`lightning'). We discuss the possibility of observing lightning and sprite
discharges in protoplanetary discs by Astronomically Low Frequency ({\em ALF})
waves, {\em IR} images, {\em UV} lines, and high energy gamma rays. We also
discuss the effects of lightning on chondrule heating, planetesimal growth and
magnetorotational instability of the disc.

radiative transfer calculations post-processed on outputs from cosmological
hydrodynamic simulations. In our simulations, reionization begins in overdense
regions and then ""leaks"" directly into voids, with filaments reionizing last
owing to their combination of high recombination rate and low emissivity. This
result depends on the uniquely-biased emissivity field predicted by our
prescriptions for star formation and feedback, which have previously been shown
to account for a wide array of measurements of the post-reionization Universe.
It is qualitatively robust to our choice of simulation volume, ionizing escape
fraction, and spatial resolution (in fact it grows stronger at higher spatial
resolution) even though the exact overlap redshift is sensitive to each of
these. However, it weakens slightly as the escape fraction is increased owing
to the reduced density contrast at higher redshift. We also explore whether our
results are sensitive to commonly-employed approximations such as using
optically-thin Eddington tensors or substantially altering the speed of light.
Such approximations do not qualitatively change the topology of reionization.
However, they can systematically shift the overlap redshift by up to $\Delta
z\sim 0.5$, indicating that accurate radiative transfer is essential for
computing reionization. Our model cannot simultaneously reproduce the observed
optical depth to Thomson scattering and ionization rate per hydrogen atom at
$z=6$, which could owe to numerical effects and/or missing early sources of
ionization.

As the energy, when present helicity cascades to smaller scales where it
dissipates. However, the role played by helicity in the energy cascade is still
unclear. In non-helical flows, the velocity and the vorticity tend to align
locally creating patches with opposite signs of helicity. Also in helical flows
helicity changes sign rapidly in space. Not being a positive definite quantity,
global studies considering its spectral scaling in the inertial range are
inconclusive, except for cases where one sign of helicity is dominant. We use
the cancellation exponent to characterize the scaling laws followed by helicity
fluctuations in numerical simulations of helical and non-helical turbulent
flows, with different forcing functions and spanning a range of Reynolds
numbers from approximately 670 to 6200. The exponent is a measure of
sign-singularity and can be related to the fractal dimension as well as to the
first order helicity scaling exponent. The results are consistent with the
geometry of helical structures being filamentary. Further analysis indicates
that statistical properties of helicity fluctuations do not depend on the

combined effect of turbulent advection and plasma resistivity is to carry
infinitely many field lines to each space point, with the resultant magnetic
field at that point given by the average over all the individual line vectors.
As a consequence of the roughness of the advecting velocity, this remains true
even in the limit of zero resistivity. We show that the presence of dynamo
effect requires sufficient angular correlation of the passive line-vectors that
arrive simultaneously at the SAME space point. We demonstrate this in detail
for the Kazantsev-Kraichnan model of kinematic dynamo with a Gaussian advecting
velocity that is spatially rough and white-noise in time. In the regime where
dynamo action fails, we also obtain the precise rate of decay of the magnetic
energy. These exact results for the model are obtained by a generalization of
the ``slow-mode expansion'' of Bernard, Gawedzki and Kupiainen to non-Hermitian

is that the implementation of higher dimensional qudits is relatively easy. As
we have recently shown, the quantum states of these spatial qudits can be
analyzed by scanning a single interference pattern. This method of single scan
tomography can also be applied at higher dimensions, but the reconstruction
becomes more sensitive to smaller details of the scanned patterns as the
dimensions increase. In this paper, we investigate the effect of finite
measurement resolution on the single scan tomography of spatial qutrits.
Realistic measurement operators describing the spatial resolution of the
measurement are introduced and the corresponding pattern functions for quantum
state reconstruction are derived. We use the pattern functions to analyze
experimental results for entangled pairs of spatial qutrits generated by
spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). It is shown that a reliable

approximately five orders of magnitude. At 100 K, the relative resistance
fluctuation, SR/R2, in the low resistance state displayed a power law
dependence on the resistance R with exponent w = 1.6. This behavior can be
explained by percolation theory; however, at higher temperatures or near the
switching voltage, SR/R2 becomes enhanced further. This large 1/f noise can be
therefore an important problem in the development of resistance random access
memory devices.

small planetesimals approaching the protoplanets lose their energy by gas drag
from the atmospheres, which leads them to be captured within the Hill sphere of
the protoplanets. As a result, growth rates of the protoplanets are enhanced.
In order to study the effect of an atmosphere on planetary growth rates, we
performed numerical integration of orbits of planetesimals for a wide range of
orbital elements and obtained the effective accretion rates of planetesimals
onto planets that have atmospheres. Numerical results are obtained as a
function of planetesimals' eccentricity, inclination, planet's radius, and
non-dimensional gas-drag parameters which can be expressed by several physical
quantities such as the radius of planetesimals and the mass of the protoplanet.
Assuming that the radial distribution of the gas density near the surface can
be approximated by a power-law, we performed analytic calculation for the loss
of planetesimals' kinetic energy due to gas drag, and confirmed agreement with
numerical results. We confirmed that the above approximation of the power-law
density distribution is reasonable for accretion rate of protoplanets with one
to ten Earth-masses, unless the size of planetesimals is too small. We also
calculated the accretion rates of planetesimals averaged over a Rayleigh
distribution of eccentricities and inclinations, and derived a semi-analytical
formula of accretion rates, which reproduces the numerical results very well.
Using the obtained expression of the accretion rate, we examined the growth of
protoplanets in nebular gas. We found that the effect of atmospheric gas drag
can enhance the growth rate significantly, depending on the size of

showed an unexpected decrease in its integrated apparent brightness, an
apparent reversal of its long-term brightening. Subsequent HST/WFPC2 photometry
of the central star in the near-UV showed that this was not a simple reversal.
This multi-wavelength photometry did not support increased extinction by dust
as the explanation for the decrease in brightness. A spectrum obtained with
GMOS on the Gemini-South telescope, revealed subtle changes mid-way in $\eta$
Car's 5.5 yr spectroscopic cycle 0when compared with HST/STIS spectra at the
same phase in the cycle. At mid-cycle the secondary star is 20--30 AU from the
primary. We suggest that the spectroscopic changes are consistent with
fluctuations in the density and velocity of the primary star's wind, unrelated
to the 5.5 yr cycle but possibly related to its latitude-dependent morphology.
We also discuss subtle effects that must be taken into account when comparing
ground-based and HST/STIS spectra.

allows to split the condensate. To avoid in the ensuing phase-accumulation
stage of the interferometer dephasing due to the nonlinear atom-atom

sufficiently low. We show that low number fluctuations (high number squeezing)
can be obtained by optimized splitting protocols. Two types of solutions are
found: in the Josephson regime we find an oscillatory tunnel control and a
parametric amplification of number squeezing, while in the Fock regime
squeezing is obtained solely due to the nonlinear coupling, which is
transformed to number squeezing by peaked tunnel pulses. We study splitting and
squeezing within the frameworks of a generic two-mode model, which allows us to
study the basic physical mechanisms, and the multi-configurational time
dependent Hartree for bosons method, which allows for a microscopic modeling of
the splitting dynamics in realistic experiments. Both models give similar
results, thus highlighting the general nature of these two solution schemes. We
finally analyze our results in the context of atom interferometry.

gravity in distributed systems can produce the stunning variety of structures
we see. At the same time, measures across the spectrum have made it clear that
galaxy interactions are linked to star formation, albeit with the physical
mechanisms much less clear. Improved data sets, including HST imaging, deep IR
data, and large samples with well-defined selection criteria, have started to
reveal correlations with dynamical parameters pointing to detailed histories of
starbirth during collisions. The merger hypothesis for elliptical galaxies has
broadened into seeing interactions and mergers as important parts of the
overall evolution of galaxies. The connection becomes more important as we look
to higher redshift, where more frequent interactions can drive the evolution of
galaxies in multiple ways. Links between the properties of central black holes
and surrounding galaxies makes it important likewise to understand the
connections between AGN and interactions, which has remained more ambiguous due
to the strong role of sample selection. Finally, contemporary data reach deep
enough to show that most galaxies have interacted in the observable past; we

one set of points to another set of points in the cheapest way - is a very old
problem going back several hundreds of years. In recent years the solution of
the problem has found applications in the analysis of digital images when
searching for similarities and discrepancies between images. The main drawback,
however, is the long computation time for finding the solution.
  In this paper we present some new results by which the time for solving the
transportation problem in the plane can be reduced substantially. As
cost-function we choose a distance-function between points in the plane. We
consider both the case when the distance-function is equal to the ordinary
Euclidean distance, as well as the case when the distance-function is equal to
the square of the Euclidean distance. This latter distance-function has the
advantage that it is integer-valued if the coordinates of the points in the
plane are integers.

difference when comparing the CMD of clusters to derive relative ages. We
compare NGC 1851 with NGC 6121 (M4), a cluster of very similar [Fe/H]. We find
that, with a suitable shift of the CMDs that brings the two red horizontal
branches at the same magnitude level, the unevolved main sequence and red giant
branch match, but the SGB of NGC 6121 and its red giant branch ""bump"" are
fainter than in NGC 1851. In particular, the SGB of NGC 6121 is even slightly
fainter than the the faint SGB in NGC 1851. Both these features can be
explained if the total CNO in NGC 6121 is larger than that in NGC 1851, even if
the two clusters are coeval. We conclude by warning that different initial
C+N+O abundances between two clusters, otherwise similar in metallicity and

source of secondary fluctuations at small angular scales (l > 1000). We
investigate the effects of the SZ modelling in the determination of the

computation by comparing three increasingly complex modelling, from a fixed

cosmological parameter dependency. We also examine the dependency of the
cosmological parameter estimation on the intra-cluster gas description used to
calculate the SZ spectrum. We show that methods assuming an SZ template bias
the cosmological parameters (by up to 2 sigmas on sigma_8) when the cosmology
used in the template deviates from the reference one. A joint CMB-SZ analysis
with a full cosmological dependency of the SZ spectrum does not suffer from
such biases and moreover improves the confidence intervals of sigma_8 and
Omega_{dm}h^2 (2.5 and 2 times respectively) with respect to a pure CMB
analysis. However, the latter method is quite sensitive to the intra-cluster

frequencies with matched uv-plane coverage is made, in order to search for any
anomalous excess emission which can be attributed to spinning dust. Possible
emission from spinning dust is identified as a source within a 2' radius of the
Scuba position of the Lynds dark nebula, exhibiting an excess with respect to
lower frequency radio emission. We find five sources which show a possible
spinning dust component in their spectra. These sources have rising spectral
indices in the frequency range 14.2--17.9 GHz. Of these five one has already
been reported, L1111, we report one new definite detection, L675, and three new
probable detections (L944, L1103 and L1246). The relative certainty of these
detections is assessed on the basis of three criteria: the extent of the
emission, the coincidence of the emission with the Scuba position and the
likelihood of alternative explanations for the excess. Extended microwave
emission makes the likelihood of the anomalous emission arising as a
consequence of a radio counterpart to a protostar or a proto-planetary disk
unlikely. We use a 2' radius in order to be consistent with the IRAS

group-theoretical model of correlated systems, Cooper pairs are stabilized by a
nonadiabatic mechanism of constraining forces effective in narrow

is mediated by the energetically lowest boson excitations in the considered
material that carry the crystal spin-angular momentum 1 x h-bar. These
crystal-spin-1 bosons are proposed to determine whether the material is a

the electron-phonon mechanism that enters the BCS theory in conventional

summary of recent advances in the theory of gravitational self-interaction in
curved spacetime, and proceed to survey some of the ideas and computational
strategies devised for implementing this theory in the case of a particle
orbiting a Kerr black hole. We review in detail two of these methods: (i) the
standard mode-sum method, in which the metric perturbation is regularized
mode-by-mode in a multipole decomposition, and (ii) $m$-mode regularization,
whereby individual azimuthal modes of the metric perturbation are regularized

the choice of gauge, the numerical representation of the particle singularity,
and how high-frequency contributions near the particle are dealt with in
frequency-domain calculations. As an example of a full end-to-end

a direct integration of the Lorenz-gauge perturbation equations in the time

carried out therefore allowing access to large systems. The small truncation
error which results does not change with time and consequently the method
grants access to a controlled description of the long time behavior which is a

generation of star depend on the Wouthuysen-Field (W-F) coupling, which relates
the spin temperature with the kinetic temperature of hydrogen gas via the
resonant scattering between Lyman alpha photons and neutral hydrogen. Although
the center object generally is a strong source of these photons, the transfer
of these photons in the 21 cm region is inefficient, as the optical depth of
the photons is large. Consequently, these photons from the source may not be
able to transfer to the entire 21 cm region timely to provide the W-F coupling.
This problem is important because the lifetime of first stars generally is
short. The problem is investigated with numerical solution of the
integro-differential equation, which describes the kinetics of these resonant
photons in both physical and frequency spaces. We show that the photon transfer
process in the physical space is actually coupled to that in the frequency
space. Firstly diffusion in the frequency space provides a shortcut for the
diffusion in the physical space. It makes the mean time for the escape of the
resonant photon in optical depth \tau media roughly proportional to the optical
depth \tau, not \tau^2. Secondly the resonant scattering is effective in
bouncing photons with a frequency which is not equal to initial frequency back
to the initial frequency. This process can restore initial frequency photons
and establish the local Boltzmann distribution of the photon spectrum around
the initial frequency. Therefore, the mechanism of 'escape via shortcut' plus
'bounce back' enables W-F coupling to be properly realized in the 21 cm region
around first stars. This mechanism also works for photons injected into the 21
cm region by redshift.

perturbations of the primordial gravitational potential, characterized by the
non-linearity parameter $g_{NL}$. The maps are used to study the characteristic
nature of the resulting non-Gaussian temperature fluctuations. We measure the
genus and investigate how it deviates from Gaussian shape as a function of
$g_{NL}$ and smoothing scale. We find that the deviation of the non-Gaussian
genus curve from the Gaussian one has an antisymmetric, sine function like
shape, implying more hot and more cold spots for $g_{NL}>0$ and less of both
for $g_{NL}<0$. The deviation increases linearly with $g_{NL}$ and also
exhibits mild increase as the smoothing scale increases. We further study other
statistics derived from the genus, namely, the number of hot spots, the number
of cold spots, combined number of hot and cold spots and the slope of the genus
curve at mean temperature fluctuation. We find that these observables carry
signatures of $g_{NL}$ that are clearly distinct from the quadratic order
perturbations, encoded in the parameter $f_{NL}$. Hence they can be very useful
tools for distinguishing not only between non-Gaussian temperature fluctuations
and Gaussian ones but also between $g_{NL}$ and $f_{NL}$ type
non-Gaussianities.

X-ray grating spectroscopy. A 118 ks Chandra grating (HETG) observation of 3C
382 has revealed the presence of several high ionization absorption lines in
the soft X-ray band, from Fe, Ne, Mg and Si. The absorption lines are
blue-shifted with respect to the systemic velocity of 3C 382 by -840\pm60 km/s
and are resolved by Chandra with a velocity width of 340\pm70 km/s. The outflow
appears to originate from a single zone of gas of column density $N_{\rm H} =
1.3 \times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ and ionization parameter $\log \xi = 2.45$. From
the above measurements we calculate that the outflow is observed on parsec

low-mass star formation, and they determined the physical conditions under
which this suppression may or may not occur. In this work, we explore the
sensitivity of the chemistry of interstellar gas under a wide range of
conditions. We use these results to predict the relative velocity-integrated
antenna temperatures of the CO rotational spectrum for several models of high
redshift active galaxies which may produce both top-heavy and unbiased IMFs. We
find that while active galaxies with solar metallicity (and top-heavy IMFs)
produce higher antenna temperatures than those with sub-solar metallicity (and
unbiased IMFs) the actual rotational distribution is similar. The high-J to
peak CO ratio however may be used to roughly infer the metallicity of a galaxy
provided we know whether it is active or quiescent. The metallicity strongly
influences the shape of the IMF. High order CO transitions are also found to
provide a good diagnostic for high far-UV intensity and low metallicity
counterparts of Milky Way type systems both of which show some evidence for
having top-heavy IMFs. We also compute the relative abundances of molecules
known to be effective tracers of high density gas in these galaxy models. We
find that the molecules CO and CS may be used to distinguish between solar and
sub-solar metallicity in active galaxies at high redshift whereas HCN, HNC and
CN are found to be relatively insensitive to the IMF shape at the large visual
magnitudes typically associated with extragalactic sources.

as they significantly contribute to the interstellar FUV field and,
consequently, play an important role in the energy balance of the ISM. Despite
their importance, very little is known about their formation process and only a
few studies have been devoted to characterize the first phases in the evolution
of intermediate mass protostars. Here we consider in great detail the case of
the brightest and closest known young IM protostar: FIR4 in the OMC2 component
of the Orion molecular cloud complex. Methods. We analyzed the available
continuum emission (maps and SED) through one-dimensional dust radiative
transfer calculations. We ran large grids of models to find the envelope model
that best fits the data. The derived dust density and temperature profiles have
been then used to compute the gas temperature profile, equating gas cooling and
heating terms across the envelope. Last, we computed the water line spectrum
for various possible values of water abundance. Results. The luminosity of FIR4
has been reevaluated to 1000 Lo, making FIR4 definitively an Intermediate Mass
protostar. The envelope surrounding FIR4 has a relatively shallow density power
law index, ~ 0.6. The most surprising result is that the gas and dust are
thermally decoupled in the interior of the envelope, where the dust ices
sublimate at 100 K. This has important consequences in the interpretation of
the line data. We provide the predictions for the water spectrum, and discuss
in detail the lines which will be observed by the Herschel Space Observatory .

expected violation of the boundary law. I discuss this negative result in the
context of attempts to find highly entangled states of quantum matter.

product of three operators, has recently drawn much attention as an interesting
structure generalising the commutator. The ternutator satisfies cubic
identities analogous to the quadratic Jacobi identity for the commutator. We
present various forms of these identities and discuss the possibility of using
them to define ternary algebras.

developed. Behaviour of cars is defined by conditional probability of car
velocity depending on the distance and velocity of the car ahead. A system
consisting of different cars is modelled by a system of two types of cars
differing in maximal velocity or efficiency of brakes. Starting from
conditional probabilities and using principle of maximum entropy, probability
densities of car velocities and headways are calculated. It is shown that the
first-order phase transition between free flow and congested traffic may be
driven by number of fast cars in a system of slow cars, and, as a rule,
admixture of cars of superior qualities does not increase but decreases the
total flow. In the system of cars with poor brakes platoons of cars of the same
velocity are formed. They are dissolved by a small addition of cars with good
brakes. Application of principle of maximum entropy was justified by comparing
the results with steady state properties of an equivalent kinetic model.
