spaces of the form R x SU(3)/H, with H equals either SU(2) x U(1) or U(1) x
U(1). For the corresponding quiver gauge theory we derive the equations of
motion and construct some specific solutions for the Higgs fields using
different gauge groups. Specifically we choose the gauge groups U(6) and U(8)
for the space R x CP^2 as well as the gauge group U(3) for the space R x
SU(3)/U(1)xU(1), and derive Yang-Mills equations for the latter one using a
spin connection endowed with a non-vanishing torsion. We find that a specific
value for the torsion is necessary in order to obtain non-trivial solutions of
Yang-Mills equations. Finally, we take the space R x CP^1 x CP^2 and derive the
equations of motion for the Higgs sector for a U(3m+3) gauge theory.

between a massless O(2) symmetric regime, a massive O(3) symmetric phase and
another massive phase with a spontaneously broken Z_2 symmetry. The first two
phases are separated by a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. When \theta = \pi the
O(3) symmetric phase flows to an interacting fixed point; sigma model kinks and
their dyonic partners become degenerate, mirroring the behaviour of monopoles

of both a model polymer system and a binary mixture were performed by varying
the temperature, the density $\rho$, the potential and the polymer length to

sub-Riemannian structure on a corank 1 distribution having an additional
transversal infinitesimal symmetry. After the factorization by the integral
foliation of this symmetry, such sub-Riemannian structure can be reduced to a

incorporate the chiral constraints from QCD. Nevertheless, for systems
involving one baryon, the power counting which dictates the chiral order of
observables is not as simple and consensual as in the purely mesonic case. The
heavy baryon approach, which relies on a non-relativistic expansion around the
limit of infinitely heavy baryon, recovers the usual power counting but
destroys some analytic properties of the scattering amplitude. Some years ago,
Becher and Leutwyler proposed a Lorentz-invariant formulation of chiral
perturbation theory that maintains the required analytic properties, but at the
expense of a less intuitive power counting.
  Aware of the shortcomings of the heavy baryon formalism, the S\~ao Paulo
group derived the two-pion exchange component of the nucleon-nucleon potential
in line with the works of Becher and Leutwyler. A striking result was that the
long distance properties of the potential is determined by the specific low

expansion fails. In this talk I will discuss the origin of such failure and how
it reflects in the asymptotics of the nucleon-nucleon interaction. Some results

Paterson and John Conway. The game starts with p spots, lasts at most 3p-1
moves, and the player who makes the last move wins. In the misere version of
Sprouts, on the contrary, the player who makes the last move loses. Sprouts is
a very intricate game, and the first computer analysis in 1991 reached only
p=11. New results were made possible in 2007 up to p=32 by using combinatorial
game theory: when a position is a sum of independant games, it is possible to
replace some of these games by a natural number, called the nimber, without
changing the winning or losing outcome of the complete position. However, this
reduction does not apply to the misere version, making the analysis of Sprouts
(and more generally of any game) more difficult in the misere version. In 1991,
only p=9 was reached in misere Sprouts, and we describe in this paper how we
obtained up to p=17. First, we describe a theoretical tool, the reduced
canonical tree, which plays a role similar to the nimber in the normal version.
Then, we describe the way we have implemented it in our program, and detail the
results it allowed us to obtain on misere Sprouts.

most modern humans. When, with the agricultural revolution, societies became
larger and more complex, the collective nature of the monitoring and punishment
of norm violators was no longer effective. This led to the emergence of new
institutions of governance and social hierarchies. Likely, the smooth
acceptance of the new institutions was possible only because, in the majority
of the population, the reciprocator trait had become an internalized norm.
However the new ruling class has its own dynamics which in turn may lead to new

Through the release

processes that shape the global circulation of the atmosphere and thus climate.
Here we present an overview of how latent heat release affects atmosphere
dynamics in a broad range of climates, ranging from extremely cold to extremely
warm. Contrary to widely held beliefs, atmospheric circulation statistics can
change non-monotonically with global-mean surface temperature, in part because
of dynamic effects of water vapor. For example, the strengths of the tropical
Hadley circulation and of zonally asymmetric tropical circulations, as well as
the kinetic energy of extratropical baroclinic eddies, can be lower than they
presently are both in much warmer climates and in much colder climates. We
discuss how latent heat release is implicated in such circulation changes,
particularly through its effect on the atmospheric static stability, and we
illustrate the circulation changes through simulations with an idealized
general circulation model. This allows us to explore a continuum of climates,
constrain macroscopic laws governing this climatic continuum, and place past
and possible future climate changes in a broader context.

calculation is a critical component of the online planning process that is
required for plan optimization of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).
Computer graphics processing units (GPUs) are well-suited to provide the
requisite fast performance for the data-parallel nature of dose calculation. In
this work, we develop a dose calculation engine based on a finite-size pencil
beam (FSPB) algorithm and a GPU parallel computing framework. The developed
framework can accommodate any FSPB model. We test our implementation on a case
of a water phantom and a case of a prostate cancer patient with varying beamlet

times when using a NVIDIA Tesla C1060 card in comparison with a 2.27GHz Intel
Xeon CPU. The computational time for calculating dose deposition coefficients
for a 9-field prostate IMRT plan with this new framework is less than 1 second.

conflicting estimates. We show here that the quiet periods in which the signals
goes down below the instrumental thresholds, put strong upper limits on the
values of $\Gamma_0$. According to the standard internal-external shocks model
an external shock should develop during the prompt stage. This external shock
radiates in the hard X-rays to soft gamma-rays bands and this emission should
be seen as a smooth background signal. The observed deep minima indicate that
this contribution is negligible. This limits, in turn, $\Gamma_0$. We obtain
upper limits on $\Gamma_0$ for several bursts with typical values around
hundreds. We compare these values with those obtained by the other methods,
which typically yield lower limits. The results are marginally consistent
leaving only a narrow range of allowed values for $\Gamma_0$.

nodes that have limited power, memory, and bandwidth. Each node is capable of
both sensing and storing data. Such sensor nodes might disappear from the
network due to failures or battery depletion. Hence it is desired to design
efficient schemes to collect data from these $n$ nodes. We propose two
distributed storage algorithms (DSA's) that utilize network flooding to solve
this problem. In the first algorithm, DSA-I, we assume that every node utilizes
network flooding to disseminate its data throughout the network using a mixing
time of approximately O(n). We show that this algorithm is efficient in terms
of the encoding and decoding operations. In the second algorithm, DSA-II, we
assume that the total number of nodes is not known to every sensor; hence
dissemination of the data does not depend on $n$. The encoding operations in
this case take $O(C\mu^2)$, where $\mu$ is the mean degree of the network graph
and $C$ is a system parameter. We evaluate the performance of the proposed
algorithms through analysis and simulation, and show that their performance
matches the derived theoretical results.

computing for comparison purpose. A prostate IMRT case with various beamlet and
voxel sizes was used to evaluate our implementation. On an NVIDIA Tesla C1060

the conceptual first-class objects represented in the containers. Further,
generic algorithms acting on this arrow container are systematically used to
provide natural geometric operations on the topology and also, through duality,
on the data. Finally, coverings and duality are used to encode not only
individual meshes, but all types of hierarchies underlying PDE data structures,
including multigrid and mesh partitions.
  In order to demonstrate the usefulness of the framework, we show how the mesh

several benefits in terms of code reuse, simplicity, and extensibility. We

  arXiv:0908.4428",,,,"cond-mat.supr-con","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A major impediment to solving the problem of high-$T_c$ superconductivity is
the ongoing confusion about the magnitude, structure and doping dependence of
the superconducting gap, $\Delta_0$, and of the mysterious pseudogap found in
underdoped samples\cite{TallonLoram}. The pseudogap opens around the ($\pi$,0)
antinodes below a temperature $T^*$ leaving Fermi arcs across the remnant Fermi
surface\cite{Kanigel} on which the superconducting gap forms at $T_c$. One
thing that seems agreed is that the ratio $2\Delta_0/k_BT_c$ well exceeds the
BCS value and grows with underdoping\cite{Miyakawa1,Miyakawa2}, suggesting
unconventional, non-BCS superconductivity. Here we re-examine data from many
spectroscopies, especially Raman $B_{1g}$ and $B_{2g}$
scattering\cite{Sacuto,Guyard}, and reconcile them all within a two-gap
scenario showing that the points of disagreement are an artefact of
spectral-weight loss arising from the pseudogap. Crucially, we find that
$\Delta_0(p)$, or more generally the order parameter, now scales with the
mean-field $T_c$ value, adopting the weak-coupling BCS ratio across the entire

enables in-situ alignment of single-crystal samples containing low-symmetry
magnetic species such as single-molecule magnets (SMMs). This cavity-based
method involves recording spectra at fixed frequency and field, while sweeping
the field orientation. The method is applied to the study of a low-symmetry
Jahn-Teller variant of the spin S = 10 Mn12 SMMs (e.g. Mn12-acetate). The
low-symmetry complex is also an SMM, but with a significantly reduced barrier
to magnetization reversal (Ueff ~ 43 K) and, hence, faster relaxation at low
temperature in comparison with the high-symmetry species. Mn12 complexes that
crystallize in lower symmetry structures exhibit a tendency for one or more of
the Mn(III) Jahn-Teller axes to be abnormally oriented, which is believed to be
the cause of the faster relaxation. An extensive HFEPR study of
[Mn12O12(O2CCH2But)16(H2O)4].CH2Cl2.MeNO2 is presented in order to examine the
influence of the abnormally oriented Jahn-Teller axis on the effective barrier.
The reduction in the axial anisotropy, D, is found to be insufficient to
account for the nearly 40% reduction in Ueff. However, the reduced symmetry of
the Mn12 core gives rise to a very significant 2nd order transverse anisotropy,
E ~ D/6. This, in turn, causes a significant mixing of spin projection states
well below the top of the classical barrier. Thus, magnetic quantum tunneling
is the dominant factor contributing to the barrier reduction in fast relaxing
Mn12 SMMs.

width constraints yields the Gaussian distribution. Also, the basic solutions
of the standard Fokker-Planck (FP) equation (related to the Langevin equation
with additive noise), as well as the Central Limit Theorem attractors, are
Gaussians. The simplest stochastic model with such features is N to infinity
independent binary random variables, as first proved by de Moivre and Laplace.
What happens for strongly correlated random variables? Such correlations are
often present in physical situations as e.g. systems with long range
interactions or memory. Frequently q-Gaussians become observed. This is
typically so if the Langevin equation includes multiplicative noise, or the FP
equation to be nonlinear. Scale-invariance, i.e. exchangeable binary stochastic
processes, allow a systematical analysis of the relation between correlations
and non-Gaussian distributions. In particular, a generalized stochastic model
yielding q-Gaussians for all q (including q>1) was missing. This is achieved
here by using the Laplace-de Finetti representation theorem, which embodies
strict scale-invariance of interchangeable random variables. We demonstrate
that strict scale invariance together with q-Gaussianity mandates the
associated extensive entropy to be BG.

Density-functional results have been unsatisfactory. Even the generally much

be controlled systematically and driven to zero. In both structural phases we
were able to benchmark the error of the phaseless constraint by carrying out
exact unconstrained AFQMC calculations for small supercells. Comparison between
the two shows that the systematic error in the absolute total energies due to
the phaseless constraint is well within 0.5 mHa/atom. Consistent with these
internal benchmarks, the transition pressure obtained by the phaseless AFQMC
from large supercells is in very good agreement with experiment.

where observed data can be sparsely represented. This under-complete dictionary
learning task can be formulated as a blind separation problem of sparse sources
linearly mixed with an unknown orthogonal mixing matrix. This issue is
formulated in a Bayesian framework. First, the unknown sparse sources are
modeled as Bernoulli-Gaussian processes. To promote sparsity, a weighted
mixture of an atom at zero and a Gaussian distribution is proposed as prior
distribution for the unobserved sources. A non-informative prior distribution
defined on an appropriate Stiefel manifold is elected for the mixing matrix.
The Bayesian inference on the unknown parameters is conducted using a Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. A partially collapsed Gibbs sampler is
designed to generate samples asymptotically distributed according to the joint
posterior distribution of the unknown model parameters and hyperparameters.
These samples are then used to approximate the joint maximum a posteriori
estimator of the sources and mixing matrix. Simulations conducted on synthetic
data are reported to illustrate the performance of the method for recovering
sparse representations. An application to sparse coding on under-complete
dictionary is finally investigated.

showed that the more complex the learner the higher the possibility that his

an empirical investigation of this problem. We investigate two characteristics
of randomness, the stochastic and algorithmic complexity of the binary sequence
of mistakes. A learner with a Markov model of order $k$ is trained on a finite
binary sequence produced by a Markov source of order $k^{*}$ and is tested on a
different random sequence. As a measure of learner's complexity we define a
quantity called the \emph{sysRatio}, denoted by $\rho$, which is the ratio
between the compressed and uncompressed lengths of the binary string whose
$i^{th}$ bit represents the maximum \emph{a posteriori} decision made at state
$i$ of the learner's model. The quantity $\rho$ is a measure of information
density. The main result of the paper shows that this ratio is crucial in
answering the above posed question. The result indicates that there is a
critical threshold $\rho^{*}$ such that when $\rho\leq\rho^{*}$ the sequence of
mistakes possesses the following features: (1)\emph{}low divergence $\Delta$
from a random sequence, (2) low variance in algorithmic complexity. When
$\rho>\rho^{*}$, the characteristics of the mistake sequence changes sharply
towards a\emph{}high\emph{$\Delta$} and high variance in algorithmic
complexity.

X-ray and optical variability and to characterise the spectral and timing
properties of the bright and faint states. We have found a correlation between
the spectral and temporal parameters that fit the energy and power spectra.
Softer energy spectra correspond to softer power spectra. That is to say, when
the energy spectrum is soft the power at high frequencies is suppressed. We
also present the results of our monitoring of the Halpha line of the optical
counterpart since its discovery in 2003. There is a correlation between the
strength and shape of the Halpha line, originated in the circumstellar envelope
of the massive companion and the X-ray emission from the vicinity of the
neutron star. Halpha emission, indicative of an equatorial disc around the
B-type star, is detected whenever the source is bright in X-rays. When the disc

protein-protein interaction networks (interactomes) in aging. Hubs and

healthy aging promising candidates for the prevention and treatment of

high Lorentz factor part when the latter is decelerated by the surrounding

long-lasting weak reverse shock until the whole ejecta are shocked. Meanwhile,
the forward shocked materials are gradually supplied with energy from the
ejecta that are catching-up, and thus the temporal decay of the forward shock
emission will be slower than that without an energy supply. However, the
reverse shock may be strong. Here, we extend the standard reverse-forward shock
model to the case of radially nonuniform ejecta. We show that this process can
be classified into two cases: the thick shell case and the thin shell case. In
the thin shell case, the reverse shock is weak and the temporal scaling law of
the afterglow is the same as that in Sari & Mesz (2000). However, in the thick

by high-frequency limits of Wigner distributions associated to solutions to the
Schroedinger equation on the standard d-dimensional torus T^{d}. From the point
of view of semiclassical analysis, our setting corresponds to performing the
semiclassical limit at times of order 1/h, as the characteristic wave-length h
of the initial data tends to zero. It turns out that, in spite that for fixed h
every Wigner distribution satisfies a Liouville equation, their limits are no
longer uniquely determined by those of the Wigner distributions of the initial
data. We characterize them in terms of a new object, the resonant Wigner
distribution, which describes high-frequency effects associated to the fraction
of the energy of the sequence of initial data that concentrates around the set
of resonant frequencies in phase-space T^{*}T^{d}. This construction is related
to that of the so-called two-microlocal semiclassical measures. We prove that
any limit \mu of the Wigner distributions corresponding to solutions to the
Schroedinger equation on the torus is completely determined by the limits of
both the Wigner distribution and the resonant Wigner distribution of the
initial data; moreover, \mu follows a propagation law described by a family of
density-matrix Schroedinger equations on the periodic geodesics of T^{d}.
Finally, we present some connections with the study of the dispersive behavior
of the Schroedinger flow (in particular, with Strichartz estimates). Among
these, we show that the limits of sequences of position densities of solutions
to the Schroedinger equation on T^2 are absolutely continuous with respect to
the Lebesgue measure.

results. When generalized to periodically repeated impurities, a geometry so
commonly used in most DFT-calculations, this criterion shows that the energy
balance involved in such calculations contains unavoidable contributions from
the long-ranged pairwise magnetic interactions between all impurities. This
proves the fundamental inadequacy of the DFT-assumption of independent unit
cells in the case of magnetically doped low-dimensional graphene-based
materials. We show that this can be circumvented if more than one impurity per
unit cell is considered, in which case the DFT results agree perfectly well
with the criterion-based predictions for the onset of localized magnetic
moments in graphene. Furthermore, the existence of such a criterion determining
whether or not a magnetic moment is likely to arise within graphene will be
instrumental for predicting the ideal materials for future carbon-based

accuracy of high-order lattice Boltzmann (LB) models for capturing
non-equilibrium effects in rarefied gas flows. In the incompressible limit, the
LB equation is proved to be equivalent to the linearized Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook
(BGK) equation. Therefore, when the same Gauss-Hermite quadrature is used, LB
method closely assembles the discrete velocity method (DVM). In addition, the
order of Hermite expansion for the equilibrium distribution function is found
not to be correlated with the approximation order in terms of the Knudsen
number to the BGK equation, which was previously suggested by
\cite{2006JFM...550..413S}. Furthermore, we have numerically evaluated the LB
models for a standing-shear-wave problem, which is designed specifically for
assessing model accuracy by excluding the influence of gas molecule/surface
interactions at wall boundaries. The numerical simulation results confirm that
the high-order terms in the discrete equilibrium distribution function play a
negligible role. Meanwhile, appropriate Gauss-Hermite quadrature has the most
significant effect on whether LB models can describe the essential flow physics
of rarefied gas accurately. For the same order of the Gauss-Hermite quadrature,
the exact abscissae will also modestly influence numerical accuracy. Using the
same Gauss-Hermite quadrature, the numerical results of both LB and DVM methods
are in excellent agreement for flows across a broad range of the Knudsen
numbers, which confirms that the LB simulation is similar to the DVM process.
Therefore, LB method can offer flexible models suitable for simulating
continuum flows at Navier Stokes level and rarefied gas flows at the linearized
Boltzmann equation level.

around early-type main-sequence stars, we present the results obtained on the
early F-type star Theta Cygni. Elodie and Sophie at OHP were used to obtain the
spectra. Our dedicated radial-velocity measurement method was used to monitor
the star's radial velocities over five years. We also use complementary, high
angular resolution and high-contrast images taken with PUEO at CFHT. We show
that Theta Cygni radial velocities are quasi-periodically variable, with a
~150-day period. These variations are not due to the ~0.35-Msun stellar
companion that we detected in imaging at more than 46 AU from the star. The
absence of correlation between the bisector velocity span variations and the
radial velocity variations for this 7 km/s vsini star, as well as other
criteria indicate that the observed radial velocity variations are not due to
stellar spots. The observed amplitude of the bisector velocity span variations
also seems to rule out stellar pulsations. However, we observe a peak in the
bisector velocity span periodogram at the same period as the one found in the
radial velocity periodogram, which indicates a probable link between these
radial velocity variations and the low amplitude lineshape variations which are
of stellar origin. Long-period variations are not expected from this type of
star to our knowledge. If a stellar origin (hence of new type) was to be
confirmed for these long-period radial velocity variations, this would have
several consequences on the search for planets around main-sequence stars, both
in terms of observational strategy and data analysis. An alternative
explanation for these variable radial velocities is the presence of at least
one planet of a few Jupiter masses orbiting at less than 1 AU. (abridged)

cores injected in the clump evolve under the effect of gas accretion. Accretion
onto the cores follows a time-dependent accretion rate that describes accretion
in a turbulent medium. Once the accretion timescales of cores exceed their
contraction timescales, they are turned into stars. We include the effect of
feedback by the newly formed massive stars through their stellar winds. A
fraction of the wind's energy is assumed to counter gravity and disperse the
gas from the protocluster and as a consequence, quench further star formation.
The latter effect sets the final IMF of the cluster. We apply our model to a
clump that is expected to resemble the progenitor clump of the Orion Nebula
Cluster (ONC). Our model is able to reproduce both the shape and normalization
of the ONC's IMF and the mass function of dense cores in Orion. The complex
features of the ONC's IMF,i.e., a shallow slope in the mass range ~0.3-2.5
Msol,a steeper slope in the mass range ~2.5-12 Msol, and a nearly flat tail at
the high mass end are reproduced. The model predicts a 'rapid' star formation
process with an age spread for the stars of 2.3 10^5 yr which is consistent
with the fact that 80% of the ONC's stars have ages of <=0.3 Myr. The model
predicts a primordial mass segregation with the most massive stars being born
in the region between 2-4 times the core radius of the cluster. In parallel,
the model also reproduces, simultaneously, the mass function of dense cores in
Orion. We study the effects of varying the model parameters on the resulting
IMF and show that the IMF of stellar clusters is expected to show significant
variations, provided variations in the clumps and cores properties exist.

in other astrophysical environments. Their structure and evolution involves a
complex nonlinear physics that can be approached by numerical studies only.
Still, owing to a number of challenging computational aspects, only a few
numerical investigations have been undertaken so far. In this paper, we present
high-resolution three dimensional numerical simulations of relativistic
magnetized jets carrying an initially toroidal magnetic field. The presence of
a substantial toroidal component of the field is nowadays commonly invoked and
held responsible for the process of jet acceleration and collimation. We find
that the typical nose cone structures, commonly observed in axisymmetric
two-dimensional simulations, are not produced in the 3D case. Rather, the
toroidal field gives rise to strong current driven kink instabilities leading
to jet wiggling. However, it appears to be able to maintain an highly
relativistic spine along its full length. By comparing low and high resolution
simulations, we emphasize the impact of resolution on the jet dynamical
properties.

the work function change of Au, Ag, Al, Mg and Ca surfaces upon adsorption of a
monolayer of PTCDA (3,4,9,10-perylene-tetra-carboxylic-di-anhydride), perylene

for a range of metal substrates. It gives interface dipoles that compensate for
the difference in the clean metal work functions, leading to a nearly constant
work function. In contrast, adsorption of benzene always results in a decrease
of the work function, which is relatively constant for all metal substrates.
Both effects are found in perylene, where adsorption on low work function
metals gives work function pinning, whereas adsorption on high work function
metals gives work function lowering. The work function changes upon adsorption
are analyzed and interpreted in terms of two competing effects. If the molecule
and substrate interact weakly, the molecule pushes electrons into the surface,
which lowers the work function. If the metal work function is sufficiently low
with respect to the unoccupied states of the molecule, electrons are donated
into these states, which increases the binding and the work function.

adiabatic pumping, we consider an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) interferometer with a
quantum dot embedded either in one or in both arms. We employ a real-time
formalism and we perform an expansion both in the tunnel-coupling strengths
between dot and leads and in the pumping frequency, taking into account the
Coulomb interaction non perturbatively. We find that pumping in a single-dot AB
interferometer has a peristaltic but phase-coherent character. In a double-dot
AB interferometer, we find a pumping mechanism that relies purely on quantum
mechanical interference and has no classical counterpart.

of Super Soft X-ray Sources (SSS) has been observed a few weeks to months after
outburst. Novae are powered by explosive nuclear burning on the surface of a
white dwarf, and enough energy is produced to power a radiatively driven wind.
Owing to the evolution of the opacity of the ejecta, the observable spectrum
gradually shifts from optical to soft X-rays (SSS phase). It has sometimes been
assumed that at the beginning of the SSS phase no more mass loss occurs.
However, high-resolution X-ray spectra of some novae have shown highly
blue-shifted absorption lines, indicating a significant expansion. In this
paper, I show that all novae that have been observed with X-ray gratings during
their SSS phase show significant blue shifts. I argue that all models that
attempt to explain the X-ray bright SSS phase have to accommodate the continued
expansion of the ejecta.

fluxgate magnetometers, intended to measure with high precision the magnetic
field at their respective positions. However, their readouts do not provide a
direct measurement of the magnetic field at the positions of the test masses,
and hence an interpolation method must be designed and implemented to obtain
the values of the magnetic field at these positions. However, such
interpolation process faces serious difficulties. Indeed, the size of the
interpolation region is excessive for a linear interpolation to be reliable
while, on the other hand, the number of magnetometer channels does not provide
sufficient data to go beyond the linear approximation. We describe an
alternative method to address this issue, by means of neural network
algorithms. The key point in this approach is the ability of neural networks to
learn from suitable training data representing the behavior of the magnetic
field. Despite the relatively large distance between the test masses and the
magnetometers, and the insufficient number of data channels, we find that our
artificial neural network algorithm is able to reduce the estimation errors of
the field and gradient down to levels below 10%, a quite satisfactory result.
Learning efficiency can be best improved by making use of data obtained in
on-ground measurements prior to mission launch in all relevant satellite
locations and in real operation conditions. Reliable information on that

additional odd (anticommuting) directions, admits a transitive super action of
a certain super Lie group G . First we define the spaces of super automorphic
and cusp forms on the super upper half plane for an ordinary lattice in G and
give an asymptotic formula for their dimensions for high weight. For involving
also the odd directions of G we introduce local super deformation of lattices
in G and show that for high weight the spaces of super automorphic and cusp
forms are stable under such local super deformations.
