interaction for molecular dynamics and similar applications. The model consists
of atoms with prescribed geometric arrangement of active orbitals, represented
by arms of the length of half of the relevant bond lengths. The interactions
have a repulsive part between the atomic centers and an attraction between the
arm ends of different atoms. For each atom pair only the closest pair of arms
interacts attempting to form the bond. This is a picture of sigma bonds, the pi
bonds are modeled by alignment of additional internal vectors which might
characterize a given atom. Also these are primarily pair interactions. Thus
there are only pair interactions of several types present. The intrinsic
arrangement of the model elements, arms and internal vectors can be switched
depending on the environment. Thus the complexity of the many-body potentials
is replaced by pair interactions between atoms with complex internal behaviour.
The proposed model thus allows formation of new geometries, establishing new
and breaking existing bonds with the use of only pair interactions and
environment scanning. We discuss in some detail the carbon case and shortly
also hydrogen, silicon and sulfur.

that a combination of this asymmetry and an internal voltage source arising
from the motion of the C-terminal tails causes a net current to be pumped
across the microtubule wall and propagate down the microtubule through the

source, and could be significant in amplifying low-intensity endogenous

the Galaxy on their ages and metallicities are analyzed based on the new
version of the Geneva-Copenhagen Catalog. The age dependences of the major,
middle, and minor axes of the ellipsoids, and also of the dispersion of the
total residual veltocity, obey power laws with indices 0.25,0.29,0.32, and 0.27
(with uncertainties \pm 0.02). Due to the presence of thick-disk objects, the
analogous indices for all nearby stars are about a factor of 1.5 larger.
Attempts to explain such values are usually based on modeling relaxation
processes in the Galactic disk. With increasing age, the velocity ellipsoid
increases in size and becomes appreciably more spherical, turns toward the
direction of the Galactic center, and loses angular momentum. The shape of the
velocity ellipsoid remains far from equilibrium. With increasing metallicity,
the velocity ellipsoid for stars of mixed age increases in size, displays a
weak tendency to become more spherical, and turns toward the direction of the
Galactic center (with these changes occurring substantially more rapidly in the
transition through the metallicity [Fe/H]= -0.25). Thus, the ellipsoid changes
similarly to the way it does with age; however, with decreasing metallicity,
the rotational velocity about the Galactic center monotonically increases,
rather than decreases(!). Moreover, the power-law indices for the age
dependences of the axes depend on the metallicity, and display a maximum near
[Fe/H]=-0.1. The age dependences of all the velocity-ellipsoid parameters for
stars with equal metallicity are roughly the same. It is proposed that the
appearance of a metallicity dependence of the velocity ellipsoids for thin-disk
stars is most likely due to the radial migration of stars.

with the spectrum of the radiation generated by an extended polarization
current whose distribution pattern rotates faster than light {\it in vacuo}. It
is shown that by inferring the values of two free parameters from observational
data (values that are consistent with those of plasma frequency and electron
cyclotron frequency in a conventional pulsar magnetosphere), and by adjusting
the spectral indices of the power laws describing the source spectrum in
various frequency bands, one can account {\em quantitatively} for the entire
spectrum of each pulsar in terms of a single emission process. This emission
process (a generalization of the synchrotron-\'Cerenkov process to a
volume-distributed source in vacuum) gives rise to an oscillatory radiation
spectrum. Thus, the bell-shaped peaks of pulsar spectra in the ultraviolet or
$X$-ray bands (the features that are normally interpreted as manifestations of
thermal radiation) appear in the present model as higher-frequency maxima of
the same oscillations that constitute the emission bands observed in the radio
spectrum of the Crab pulsar. Likewise, the sudden steepening of the gradient of
the spectrum by -1, which occurs around $10^{18}-10^{21}$ Hz, appears as a
universal feature of the pulsar emission: a feature that reflects the transit
of the position of the observer across the frequency-dependent Rayleigh
distance. Inferred values of the free parameters of the present model suggest,
moreover, that the lower the rotation frequency of a pulsar, the more weighted
towards higher frequencies will be its observed spectral intensity.

Lorenz condition, the boundary contribution to the retarded solution of the

with distance faster than the contribution of the source density in the far

travels faster than light {\em in vacuo}, as realized in recent experiments,
the boundary term in the retarded solution governing the field is by a factor
of the order of $R^{1/2}$ {\em larger} than the source term of this solution in

infinity. This result is consistent with the prediction of the retarded
potential that part of the radiation field generated by a rotating superluminal
source decays as $R^{-1/2}$, instead of $R^{-1}$, a prediction that is
confirmed experimentally. More importantly, it pinpoints the reason why an

expression, is common among microbes, and may be important in coping with
changing environments. We use a theoretical model to assess whether such
switching is a good strategy for growth in environments with occasional
catastrophic events. We find that switching can be advantageous, but only when
the environment is responsive to the microbial population. In our model,
microbes switch randomly between two phenotypic states, with different growth
rates. The environment undergoes sudden ""catastrophes"", the probability of
which depends on the composition of the population. We derive a simple
analytical result for the population growth rate. For a responsive environment,
two alternative strategies emerge. In the ""no switching"" strategy, the
population maximises its instantaneous growth rate, regardless of catastrophes.
In the ""switching"" strategy, the microbial switching rate is tuned to minimise
the environmental response. Which of these strategies is most favourable
depends on the parameters of the model. Previous studies have shown that
microbial switching can be favourable when the environment changes in an
unresponsive fashion between several states. Here, we demonstrate an
alternative role for phase variation in allowing microbes to maximise their
growth in catastrophic responsive environments.

  Model [Dissertation]","119 pages, 7 figures",,,,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Two-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) is a model of low-energy particle
interactions that is identical to the Standard Model except for the addition of
an extra Higgs doublet. This extended Higgs sector would appear in experiments
as the presence of multiple Higgs particles, both neutral and charged. The
neutral states may either be eigenstates of CP (in the CP-conserving 2HDM), or
be mixtures of CP eigenstates (in the CP-violating 2HDM). In order to
understand how to measure the couplings of these new particles, this document
presents the theory of the CP-violating 2HDM in a basis-independent formalism
and explicitly identifies the physical parameters of the model, including a
discussion of tan(beta)-like parameters. The CP-conserving limit, decoupling
limit, and the custodial limit of the model are presented.
  In addition, phenomenological constraints from the oblique parameters (S, T,
and U) are discussed. A survey of the parameter space of this model shows that
the 2HDM is consistent with a large range of possible values for T. Our results
also suggest that the 2HDM favors a slightly positive value of S and a value of
U within .02 of zero, which is consistent with present data within the
statistical error. In a scenario in which the heaviest scalar particle is the
charged Higgs boson, we find that the measured value of T puts an upper limit
on the mass difference between the charged Higgs boson and the heaviest neutral
Higgs boson.

argue that because of the observed localised nature of bradyons, tachyons
should always be pervasive or global in character and thus, there can be no

matter physics, materials science and biology. Statistical descriptors such as
the $n$-body distribution function $g_n$ is usually employed to characterize
the point configurations, among which the most extensively used is the pair
distribution function $g_2$. An intriguing inverse problem of practical
importance that has been receiving considerable attention is the degree to
which a point configuration can be reconstructed from the pair distribution
function of a target configuration. Although it is known that the pair-distance
information contained in $g_2$ is in general insufficient to uniquely determine
a point configuration, this concept does not seem to be widely appreciated and
general claims of uniqueness of the reconstructions using pair information have
been made based on numerical studies. In this paper, we introduce the idea of
the distance space, called the $\mathbb{D}$ space. The pair distances of a
specific point configuration are then represented by a single point in the
$\mathbb{D}$ space. We derive the conditions on the pair distances that can be
associated with a point configuration, which are equivalent to the
realizability conditions of the pair distribution function $g_2$. Moreover, we
derive the conditions on the pair distances that can be assembled into distinct
configurations. These conditions define a bounded region in the $\mathbb{D}$
space. By explicitly constructing a variety of degenerate point configurations
using the $\mathbb{D}$ space, we show that pair information is indeed
insufficient to uniquely determine the configuration in general. We also
discuss several important problems in statistical physics based on the

stochastic phase-field models for phase transformations by coarse-graining
molecular dynamics. The studied phase transformations occur between a solid
crystal and a liquid. Nucleation and growth, sometimes dendritic, of crystal
grains in a sub-cooled liquid is determined by diffusion and convection of
heat, on the macroscopic level, and by interface effects, where the width of
the solid-liquid interface is on an atomic length-scale. Phase-field methods
are widely used in the study of the continuum level time evolution of the phase
transformations; they introduce an order parameter to distinguish between the
phases. The dynamics of the order parameter is modelled by an Allen--Cahn
equation and coupled to an energy equation, where the latent heat at the phase
transition enters as a source term. Stochastic fluctuations are sometimes added
in the coupled system of partial differential equations to introduce nucleation
and to get qualitatively correct behaviour of dendritic side-branching. In this
report the possibility of computing some of the Allen-Cahn model functions from
a microscale model is investigated. The microscopic model description of the
material by stochastic, Smoluchowski, dynamics is considered given. A local
average of contributions to the potential energy in the micro model is used to
determine the local phase, and a stochastic phase-field model is computed by
coarse-graining the molecular dynamics. Molecular dynamics simulations on a two
phase system at the melting point are used to compute a double-well reaction
term in the Allen--Cahn equation and a diffusion matrix describing the noise in

considered in the model with the Skyrme effective interaction (SLy4, SLy7

it is shown that a thermodynamically stable branch of solutions for the spin
polarization parameter as a function of density corresponds to the negative
spin polarization when the majority of neutron spins are oriented oppositely to
the direction of the magnetic field. Besides, beginning from some threshold
density being dependent on the magnetic field strength the self-consistent
equations have also two other branches (upper and lower) of solutions for the
spin polarization parameter with the positive spin polarization.
  The free energy corresponding to the upper branch turns out to be very close
to the free energy corresponding to the thermodynamically preferable branch
with the negative spin polarization. As a consequence, at a strong magnetic
field, the state with the positive spin polarization can be realized as a
metastable state at the high density region in neutron matter which under
decreasing density at some threshold density changes into a thermodynamically
stable state with the negative spin polarization. The calculations of the
neutron spin polarization parameter and energy per neutron as functions of the

small at the field strengths up to $10^{17}$ G.

both better than analogous coherent light (due to frequency entanglement) and
highly dependent on the optical setup. We show that the poor production rates

$J_2/J_1$ around 0.5. We present evidence of symmetry breaking by considering
the ket- and bra-state correlation coefficients as a function of $J_2/J_1$. We
then consider the Shastry-Sutherland model and demonstrate that the CCM can
span the correct ground states in both the N\'eel and the dimerized phases.
Finally, we consider a spin-half system with nearest-neighbor bonds for an

We find that the sSFR increases with redshift for all masses. The logarithmic
increase of the sSFR with redshift is nearly independent of mass, but this
cannot yet be verified at the lowest-mass bins at z > 0.8, due to
incompleteness. We convert the sSFRs to a dimensionless growth rate to
facilitate a comparison with a semi-analytic galaxy formation model that was
implemented on the Millennium Simulation. The model predicts that the growth
rates and sSFRs increase similarly with redshift for all masses, consistent
with the observations. However, we find that for all masses, the inferred
observed growth rates increase more rapidly with redshift than the model
predictions. We discuss several possible causes for this discrepancy, ranging
from field-to-field variance, conversions to SFR, and shape of the IMF. We find
that none of these can solve the discrepancy completely. We conclude that the
models need to be adapted to produce the steep increase in growth rate between

field magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in these disks shows that magnetic effects

explores the ramifications of these predicted disk properties for the migration
of extrasolar planets. Subkeplerian flow in gaseous disks drives a new
migration mechanism for embedded planets and modifies the gap opening processes
for larger planets. This subkeplerian migration mechanism dominates over Type I
migration for sufficiently small planets (m_P < 1 M_\earth) and/or close orbits
(r < 1 AU). Although the inclusion of subkeplerian torques shortens the total
migration time by only a moderate amount, the mass accreted by migrating
planetary cores is significantly reduced. Truncation of the inner disk edge
(for typical system parameters) naturally explains final planetary orbits with
periods P=4 days. Planets with shorter periods P=2 days can be explained by
migration during FU-Ori outbursts, when the mass accretion rate is high and the
disk edge moves inward. Finally, the midplane density is greatly increased at
the inner truncation point of the disk (the X-point); this enhancement, in
conjunction with continuing flow of gas and solids through the region, supports
the in situ formation of giant planets.

objective tidal interaction parameter for all galaxies and find that 73% of
them show tidal disturbance signatures in their stellar bodies. This is the
first time that such an analysis is done on a statistically complete sample and
it confirms that tidal features in ellipticals are common even in the local
Universe. From the dynamical time of the sample galaxies at the innermost
radius where tidal features are detected we estimate the mass assembly rate of
nearby ellipticals to be dM/M 0.2 per Gyr with large uncertainty. We explore
the relation between gravitational interaction signatures and the galaxy
environment and find that galaxies in clusters are less disturbed than group
and field galaxies. We also study how these interactions affect the broadband
colors of ellipticals and find a moderate correlation, suggesting that the
mergers are not accompanied by significant star-formation. Lastly, we find no
correlation between AGN activity, as measured by 6cm radio emission, and large
scale tidal distortions. This implies that gravitational interactions are not
the only, and perhaps not the most important, trigger of nuclear activity. In

tunneling spectroscopy in a N$|s_\pm$-wave junction, crossed Andreev reflection

insensitive to the superconducting phase in the absence of interband coupling,
the Josephson effect is intrinsically phase-dependent, and is moreover shown to
be relatively insensitive to the strength of the interband coupling. Focusing
on the Josephson current, we find a 0-$\pi$ transition as a function of the
ratio of effective barrier transparency for the two bands, as well as a similar
phase-shift effect as a function of temperature. An essential feature of this
$s_\pm$-wave model is non-sinusoidality of the current-phase relation, and we
compute the dependence of the critical current on an external magnetic field,

than declining as in the field, and the mass ratio distribution is more biased
toward similar-mass companions than the IMF or the field G dwarf distribution.
The maximum separation also shows no evidence of a limit at <5000 AU until the
abrupt cessation of any wide binary formation at system masses of ~0.3 Msun. We
attribute this result to the post-natal dynamical sculpting that occurs for

gaseous medium of adiabatic sound speed a_0. We model the perturber as a
Plummer potential with softening radius r_s, and run various models with
differing A=GM_p/(a_0^2 r_s) and M=V_p/a_0 by imposing cylindrical symmetry
with respect to the line of perturber motion. For supersonic cases, a massive
perturber quickly develops nonlinear flows that produce a detached bow shock
and a vortex ring, which is unlike in the linear cases where Mach cones are
bounded by low-amplitude Mach waves. The flows behind the shock are initially
non-steady, displaying quasi-periodic, overstable oscillations of the vortex
ring and the shock. The vortex ring is eventually shed downstream and the flows
evolve toward a quasi-steady state where the density wake near the perturber is
in near hydrostatic equilibrium. We find that the detached shock distance
$\delta$ and the nonlinear drag force F depend solely on \eta=A/(M^2-1) such
that \delta/r_s=\eta and F/F_{lin}=(\eta/2)^{-0.45} for \eta>2, where F_{lin}
is the linear drag force of Ostriker (1999). The reduction of F compared with
F_{lin} is caused by front-back symmetry in the nonlinear density wakes. In
subsonic cases, the flows without involving a shock do not readily reach a
steady state. Nevertheless, the subsonic density wake near a perturber is close
to being hydrostatic, resulting in the drag force similar to the linear case.
Our results suggest that dynamical friction of a very massive object as in a

models, using large volume N-body simulations. We consider a range of
quintessence models which feature both rapidly and slowly varying dark energy
equations of state, and compare the growth of structure to that in a universe
with a cosmological constant. The adoption of a quintessence model changes the
expansion history of the universe, the form of the linear theory power spectrum
and can alter key observables, such as the horizon scale and the distance to
last scattering. We incorporate these effects into our simulations in stages to
isolate the impact of each on the growth of structure. The difference in
structure formation can be explained to first order by the difference in growth
factor at a given epoch; this scaling also accounts for the nonlinear growth at
the 15% level. We find that quintessence models that are different from
$\Lambda$CDM both today and at high redshifts $(z \sim 1000)$ and which feature
late $(z<2)$, rapid transitions in the equation of state, can have identical
baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) peak positions to those in $\Lambda$CDM. We
find that these models have higher abundances of dark matter haloes at $z>0$
compared to $\Lambda$CDM and so measurements of the mass function should allow
us to distinguish these quintessence models from a cosmological constant.
However, we find that a second class of quintessence models, whose equation of
state makes an early $(z>2)$ rapid transition to $w=-1$, cannot be
distinguished from $\Lambda$CDM using measurements of the mass function or the
BAO, even if these models have non-negligible amounts of dark energy at early
times.

evolves with redshift is a challenging problem facing modellers of galaxy
formation. We investigate the predictions of four currently favoured
semi-analytical galaxy formation models applied to the Millennium simulation
for the mass function of cold neutral gas (atomic and molecular) in galaxies as
a function of redshift, and we use these predictions to construct number counts
for the next generation of all-sky neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) surveys.
Despite the different implementations of the physical ingredients of galaxy
formation, we find that the model predictions are broadly consistent with one
another; the key differences reflect how the models treat AGN feedback and how
the timescale for star formation evolves with redshift. The models produce mass
functions of cold gas in galaxies that are generally in good agreement with HI
surveys at $z$=0. Interestingly we find that these mass functions do not evolve
significantly with redshift. Adopting a simple conversion factor for cold gas
mass to HI mass that we apply to all galaxies at all redshifts, we derive mass
functions of HI in galaxies from the predicted mass functions of cold gas,
which we use to predict the number counts of sources likely to be detected by
HI surveys on next generation radio telescopes such as the Square Kilometre
Array and its pathfinders. We show also how adopting a conversion factor for
cold gas mass to HI mass that varies from galaxy to galaxy impacts on number
counts. In addition, we examine how the typical angular sizes of galaxies vary
with redshift. Taken together, these results make clear that forthcoming HI
surveys will provide important and powerful tests of theoretical galaxy
formation models.

for e.g. a population of protoplanetary cores in the end of the oligarchic

scattering has an anisotropic character and strongly differs from scattering in
thick ($i ~ e$) disks. We derive analytical expressions for the planetesimal

significant discrepancies in the inclination scattering coefficients obtained
by the two approaches and ascribe this difference to the effects not accounted

satellites outside the Hill sphere) and distant interaction of planetesimals
prior to their close encounter. Our calculations show that the inclination of a

oscillator cooled near its ground state of vibrational motion. This is an
extension of the nonlinear atomic homodyning technique scheme first developed
to measure the intracavity field in a micromaser. It involves the use of a
detector-atom that is simultaneously coupled to the cantilever via a magnetic
interaction and to (classical) optical fields via a Raman transition. We show
that the probability for the atom to be found in the excited state is a direct
measure of the Wigner characteristic function of the nanomechanical oscillator.
We also investigate the backaction effect of this destructive measurement on
the state of the cantilever.

star formation history (SFH) of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), based on the
application of our StarFISH analysis software to the multiband photometry of
twenty million of its stars from the Magellanic Clouds Photometric Survey. The
general outlines of our results are consistent with previously published
results: following an initial burst of star formation, there was a quiescent
epoch from approximately 12 to 5 Gyr ago. Star formation then resumed and has
proceeded until the current time at an average rate of roughly 0.2 solar
masses/yr, with temporal variations at the factor-of-two level. The re-ignition
of star formation about 5 Gyr ago, in both the LMC and SMC, is suggestive of a
dramatic event at that time in the Magellanic system. Among the global
variations in the recent star formation rate are peaks at roughly 2 Gyr, 500
Myr, 100 Myr and 12 Myr. The peaks at 500 Myr and 2 Gyr are nearly coincident
with similar peaks in the SFH of the Small Magellanic Cloud, suggesting a joint
history for these galaxies extending back at least several Gyr. The chemical
enrichment history recovered from our StarFISH analysis is in broad agreement
with that inferred from the LMC's star cluster population, although our
constraints on the ancient chemical enrichment history are weak. We conclude
from the concordance between the star formation and chemical enrichment
histories of the field and cluster populations that the field and cluster star
formation modes are tightly coupled.

atmospheric neutrino experiment. These results have been presented for a 22.5kT
water fiducial mass on an exposure of 1489 days, and the events are divided
into sub-GeV, multi-GeV and PC events. We present a study of nuclear medium
effects in the sub-GeV energy region of atmospheric neutrino events for the
quasielastic scattering, incoherent and coherent pion production processes, as
they give the most dominant contribution to the lepton events in this energy
region. We have used the atmospheric neutrino flux given by Honda et al. These
calculations have been done in the local density approximation. We take into
account the effect of Pauli blocking, Fermi motion, Coulomb effect,
renormalization of weak transition strengths in the nuclear medium in the case
of the quasielastic reactions. The inelastic reactions leading to production of
leptons along with pions is calculated in a $\Delta $- dominance model by
taking into account the renormalization of $\Delta$ properties in the nuclear
medium and the final state interaction effects of the outgoing pions with the
residual nucleus. We present the results for the lepton events obtained in our
model with and without nuclear medium effects, and compare them with the Monte
Carlo predictions used in the simulation and the experimentally observed events
reported by the Super-Kamiokande collaboration.

obstructions to the existence of closed conformal and nonparallel vector fields

theorem of T. K. Pan. Then we explain why it is so difficult to find examples,
other than trivial ones, of spaces having at least two closed, conformal and

generalizing a theorem of J. Simons on cones with parallel mean curvature to

prove general Bernstein-type theorems for certain complete, not necessarily

One good data preprocessing technique for accelerating BPN classification is
dimension reduction technique but it has problem of missing data. In this
paper, we study current pre-training techniques and new preprocessing technique
called Potential Weight Linear Analysis (PWLA) which combines normalization,
dimension reduction input values and pre-training. In PWLA, the first data
preprocessing is performed for generating normalized input values and then
applying them by pre-training technique in order to obtain the potential
weights. After these phases, dimension of input values matrix will be reduced
by using real potential weights. For experiment results XOR problem and three
datasets, which are SPECT Heart, SPECTF Heart and Liver disorders (BUPA) will
be evaluated. Our results, however, will show that the new technique of PWLA
will change BPN to new Supervised Multi Layer Feed Forward Neural Network

PWLA will be able to have power of non linear supervised and unsupervised

Methods : A limited survey of X-ray sources, consisting of all public XMM
observations (2XMMi) and slew survey data (XMMSL1), is now available. The X-ray
counterparts to hot, massive stars have been searched for in these catalogs.
Results : About 300 OB stars were detected with XMM. Half of them were bright
enough for a spectral analysis to be possible, and we make available the
detailed spectral properties that were derived. The X-ray spectra of O stars
are represented well by low (<1keV) temperature components and seem to indicate
that an absorption column is present in addition to the interstellar

with a scatter comparable to that of the RASS studies and thus larger than
found previously with XMM for some individual clusters. These results contrast
with those of B stars that exhibit a large scatter in the L_X-L_BOL relation,
no additional absorption being found, and the fits indicate a plasma at higher
temperatures. Variability (either within one exposure or between multiple
exposures) was also investigated whenever possible: short-term variations are
far more rare than long-term ones (the former affects a few percent of the
sample, while the latter concerns between one third and two thirds of the

operators requires factoring a general smooth map through maps of a very simple
type: zero sections of vector bundles, open embeddings, and vector bundle
projections. Roughly speaking, a normally non-singular map is a map together
with such a factorisation. These factorisations are models for the topological
index map. Under some assumptions concerning the existence of equivariant
vector bundles, any smooth map admits a normal factorisation, and two such
factorisations are unique up to a certain notion of equivalence. To prove this,
we generalise the Mostow Embedding Theorem to spaces equipped with proper
groupoid actions. We also discuss orientations of normally non-singular maps
with respect to a cohomology theory and show that oriented normally
non-singular maps induce wrong-way maps on the chosen cohomology theory. For
K-oriented normally non-singular maps, we also get a functor to Kasparov's
equivariant KK-theory. We interpret this functor as a topological index map.

systematically the dimensionless compressibility $g$ of the solution in order
to investigate the influence of density fluctuations in dense polymer melts on

are probed ($s \ll g$) the chains are swollen acc ording to the classical
Fixman expansion where, e.g., $P(s) \sim g^{-1}s^{-1/2}$. More importantly, the

than two grains interact through a single liquid cluster. In our model, the
cohesive force acts between the grains connected by a liquid-gas interface. As

(ELTs) is that the beam size is required to scale with telescope aperture if
all other parameters are held constant, leading to enormous size and implied
cost. This is a particular problem for image sizes much larger than the
diffraction limit, as is likely to be the case if Adaptive Optics systems are
not initially able to deliver highly corrected images over the full field of
the instrument or if signal/noise considerations require large spatial samples.
In this case, there is a potential advantage in image slicing to reduce the
effective slitwidth and hence the beam size. However, this implies larger
detectors and oversizing of the optics which may cancel out the advantage. By
the means of a toy model of a spectrograph whose dimensions are calibrated
using existing instruments, the size and relative cost of spectrographs for
ELTs have been estimated. Using a range of scaling laws derived from the
reference instruments, it is possible to estimate the uncertainties in the
predictions and to explore the consequences of different design strategies. The
model predicts major cost savings (2 - 100x) by slicing with factors of 5-20
depending on the type of spectrograph. The predictions suggest that it is
better to accommodate the multiplicity of slices within a single spectrograph
rather than distribute them among smaller, cheaper replicas in a parallel
architecture, but the replication option provides an attractive upgrade path to
integral field spectroscopy (IFS) as the input image quality is improved...

the quantum single-atom wavefunctions studied the square-root in time expansion
presents important advantages: asymptotically it leads to zero average energy
whereas any linear in time (constant box-wall velocity) expansion leaves a
non-zero residual energy, except in the limit of an infinitely slow expansion.
For finite final times and box lengths we set a number of bounds and cooling
principles which again confirm the superior performance of the square-root in

s-matter and v-matter which are symmetric and whose gravitational masses are
opposite to each other, although both masses are positive. Therefore, there are
two sorts of symmetry breaking called V-breaking and S-breaking. In the
S-breaking, s-particles get their masses and form s-galaxies etc., while
v-fermions and v-gauge bosons are still massless and form v-SU(5) singlets.
There is no interaction among the v-SU(5) color-single states except
gravitation so that they distribute loosely in space, cannot be observed and
cause space to expand with an acceleration. When temperature increases to the
critical temperature because space contracts, masses of all particles are zero
so that s-particles and v-particles transform from one to another and the
gravitational mass density becomes negative. Consequently, space stop to
contract and inflation must occur. After reheating, space first expands with a
deceleration and then expands with an acceleration up to now. There is no
space-time singularity. There are the critical temperature, the highest
temperature and the least scale in the universe. A formula describing
distance-redshift is obtained. A huge void is not empty, and is equivalent to a
huge concave lens. The densities of hydrogen in the huge voids must be much
less than that predicted by the conventional theory. The gravitation between
two galaxies with distance long enough will be less than that predicted by the
conventional theory. A black hole with its mass and density big enough will
transform into a white hole. Primordial nucleosynthesis and CMB are explained.
It is possible that the universe is composed of infinite cosmic islands. The
problem of energy conservation is discussed.

simultaneously regions of significant deviations between p and q. The
construction is built from randomized nearest-neighbor statistics. It does not
require any preliminary information about the multivariate densities such as
compact support, strict positivity or smoothness and shape properties. The
properly adjusted multiple testing procedure is shown to be sharp-optimal for
typical arrangements of the observation values which appear with probability
close to one. The proof relies on a new coupling Bernstein type exponential
inequality, reflecting the non-subgaussian tail behavior of a combinatorial
process. For power investigation of the proposed method a reparametrized
minimax set-up is introduced, reducing the composite hypothesis ""p=q"" to a
simple one with the multivariate mixed density (m/n)p+(1-m/n)q as infinite
dimensional nuisance parameter. Within this framework, the test is shown to be
spatially and sharply asymptotically adaptive with respect to uniform loss on
isotropic H\""older classes. The exact minimax risk asymptotics are obtained in

asymptotically (and with high probability), the performance of the best source
code in the set, uniformly over all source sequences. The scheme uses the same
rate and has zero delay. We then present an efficient algorithm for
implementing our on-line coding scheme in the case of a relatively small set of
encoders. We also present an efficient algorithm for the case of a larger set
of encoders with a structure, using the method of the weighted graph and the
Weight Pushing Algorithm (WPA). In the second part of this article, we extend
our results to the case of variable-rate coding. A set of variable-rate scalar
source codes is presented. We generalize the randomized on-line coding scheme,
to our case. This time, the performance is measured by the Lagrangian Cost
(LC), which is defined as a weighted sum of the distortion and the length of
the encoded sequence. We present an efficient algorithm for implementing our
on-line variable-rate coding scheme in the case of a relatively small set of

An on-line scheme which use Huffman codes is presented. We show that this

efficient algorithm for structured set of variable-rate encoders. The
complexity of all the algorithms is no more than linear in the sequence length.

field theory from mathematically well-defined ensembles of random objects. In
the present paper, based on results of the first part, we identify the
stress-energy tensor in the dilute regime of CLE. This is done by deriving both
its conformal Ward identities for single insertion in CLE probability
functions, and its properties under conformal transformations involving the
Schwarzian derivative. We also give the one-point function of the stress-energy
tensor in terms of a notion of partition function, and we show that this agrees
with standard CFT arguments. The construction is in the same spirit as that
found in the context of SLE(8/3) by the author, Riva and Cardy (2006), which
had to do with the case of zero central charge. The present construction
generalises this to all central charges between 0 and 1, including all minimal
models. This generalisation is non-trivial: the application of these ideas to
the CLE context requires the introduction of a renormalised probability, and
the derivation of the transformation properties and of the one-point function
do not have counterparts in the SLE context.

forecasting, too, suffers from measurement errors and partial model information
and may thus gain significantly from data assimilation. We present perhaps the
first fully implementable data assimilation method for earthquake forecasts
generated by a point-process model of seismicity. We test the method on a
synthetic and pedagogical example of a renewal process observed in noise, which
is relevant to the seismic gap hypothesis, models of characteristic earthquakes
and to recurrence statistics of large quakes inferred from paleoseismic data
records. To address the non-Gaussian statistics of earthquakes, we use
sequential Monte Carlo methods, a set of flexible simulation-based methods for
recursively estimating arbitrary posterior distributions. We perform extensive
numerical simulations to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of
forecasting earthquakes based on data assimilation. In particular, we show that
the forecasts based on the Optimal Sampling Importance Resampling (OSIR)
particle filter are significantly better than those of a benchmark forecast
that ignores uncertainties in the observed event times. We use the marginal
data likelihood, a measure of the explanatory power of a model in the presence

bulk nonradiative traps as well, but the annealing process reduces the density
of these bulk traps while simultaneously creating a high density of
green-emitting defects near the particle surface. The data are discussed in the

critical behavior of the one-dimensional Ising magnet, with algebraically
decaying long-range interactions of the form $\frac{1}{r^{d+\sigma}}$, with
$\sigma=0.75$. The critical temperature, as well as the critical exponents, is
evaluated from the power-law behavior of suitable physical observables when the
system is quenched from uncorrelated states, corresponding to infinite
temperature, to the critical point. These results are compared with those
obtained from the dynamic evolution of the system when it is suddenly annealed
at the critical point from the ordered state. Also, the critical temperature in
the infinite interaction limit is obtained by means of a finite-range scaling
analysis of data measured with different cutoffs of the interaction range. All
the estimated static critical exponents ($\gamma /\nu $, $\beta /\nu $, and
$1/\nu $) are in good agreement with Renormalization Group (RG) predictions and
previously reported numerical data obtained under equilibrium conditions. It is
found that the dynamic exponent $z$ is different for quenching and annealing
experiments, most likely due to the influence of the Kosterlitz-Thouless
transition occurring at relatively similar algebraic decay of the interactions
with $\sigma =1$. However, for annealing experiments the measured exponent $z$
is close to the RG predictions. On the other hand, the relevant exponents of
the dynamic behavior ($z$ and $\theta$) are slightly different than the RG
predictions, most likely due to the fact that they may depend on the especific
dynamics used (Metropolis in the present paper).

parameters. The cataclysmic variable secondary star period-mass relation
calibrated by Knigge in 2007 sets the secondary component mass. A mean white
dwarf (WD) mass from the same study, that is consistent with an
observationally-determined mass ratio, sets the adopted WD mass of
$0.7M_{\odot}$, and the WD radius follows from standard theoretical models. The
adopted inclination, $i=65{\arcdeg}$, is a literature consensus, and is
subsequently supported by $\widetilde{\chi}^2$ analysis. The mass transfer rate
is the remaining parameter to set the accretion disk $T_{\rm eff}$ profile, and
the $Hipparcos$ parallax constrains that parameter to
$\dot{M}=5.0{\pm}2.0{\times}10^{-9} M_{\odot} {\rm yr}^{-1}$ by a comparison

precession, and recoil, taking into account all 24 sodium hyperfine states and
on the order of 100 velocity groups.
