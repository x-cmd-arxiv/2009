Apart from
LSND, current data favors three flavors of light stable neutrinos and
antineutrinos, with both halves of the spectrum having one smaller mass
splitting and one larger mass splitting. Oscillation data for the smaller
splitting is consistent with CPT. For the larger splitting, current data favor
an antineutrino mass-squared splitting that is an order of magnitude larger
than the corresponding neutrino splitting, with the corresponding mixing angle
less-than-maximal. This CPT-violating spectrum is driven by recent results from
MINOS, but is consistent with other experiments if we ignore LSND. We describe
an analysis technique which, together with MINOS running optimized for muon
antineutrinos, should be able to conclusively confirm the CPT-violating
spectrum proposed here, with as little as three times the current data set. If
confirmed, the CPT-violating neutrino mass-squared difference would be an order
of magnitude less than the current most-stringent upper bound on CPT violation
for quarks and charged leptons.

and demonstrate its validity by analyzing resolved line-of-sight velocity data
for globular clusters, dwarf galaxies, and elliptical galaxies. Specifically,
by manipulating the spherical Jeans equation we show that the dynamical mass
enclosed within the 3D deprojected half-light radius r_1/2 can be determined
with only mild assumptions about the spatial variation of the stellar velocity
dispersion anisotropy. We find M_1/2 = 3 \sigma_los^2 r_1/2 / G ~ 4
\sigma_los^2 R_eff / G, where \sigma_los^2 is the luminosity-weighted square of
the line-of-sight velocity dispersion and R_eff is the 2D projected half-light
radius. While deceptively familiar in form, this formula is not the virial
theorem, which cannot be used to determine accurate masses unless the radial
profile of the total mass is known a priori. We utilize this finding to show
that all of the Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies (MW dSphs) are consistent
with having formed within a halo of mass approximately 3 x 10^9 M_sun in Lambda
CDM cosmology. The faintest MW dSphs seem to have formed in dark matter halos
that are at least as massive as those of the brightest MW dSphs, despite the
almost five orders of magnitude spread in luminosity. We expand our analysis to
the full range of observed dispersion-supported stellar systems and examine
their I-band mass-to-light ratios (M/L). The M/L vs. M_1/2 relation for
dispersion-supported galaxies follows a U-shape, with a broad minimum near M/L
~ 3 that spans dwarf elliptical galaxies to normal ellipticals, a steep rise to
M/L ~ 3,200 for ultra-faint dSphs, and a more shallow rise to M/L ~ 800 for

can be described in terms of their relative phase, treated as a random unknown
variable. This phase can be understood, either as emerging from the
measurements, or preexisting to them; in the latter case, the originating
states could be phase states with unknown phases, so that an average over all
their possible values is taken. Both points of view lead to a description of
probabilities of results of experiments in terms of a phase angle, which plays
the role of a classical variable. Nevertheless, in some situations, this
description is not sufficient: another variable, which we call the ""quantum
angle"", emerges from the theory. This article studies various manifestations of
the quantum angle. We first introduce the quantum angle by expressing two Fock
states crossing a beam splitter in terms of phase states, and relate the
quantum angle to off-diagonal matrix elements in the phase representation. Then
we consider an experiment with two beam splitters, where two experimenters make
dichotomic measurements with two interferometers and detectors that are far
apart; the results lead to violations of the Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt
inequality (valid for local-realistic theories, including classical
descriptions of the phase). Finally, we discuss an experiment where particles
from each of two sources are either deviated via a beam splitter to a side
collector or proceed to the point of interference. For a given interference
result, we find ""population oscillations"" in the distributions of the deviated
particles, which are entirely controlled by the quantum angle. Various versions
of population oscillation experiments are discussed, with two or three
independent condensates.

Especially major mergers are of particular importance, because they can change
the morphological type of galaxies. They have an impact on the mass function of
galaxies and they trigger star formation - the main driver of the Galactic
Matter Cycle. Therefore, we conducted a study of major mergers by means of a
multi-phase ISM code. This code is based on a TREE-SPH-code combined with a
sticky particle method allowing for star formation controlled by the properties
of a multi-phase ISM. This is in contrast to the usually implemented Schmidt
law depending mainly on the gas density. Previously, this code was used on
isolated galaxies. Since our star formation recipe is not restricted to a
special type of galaxy, it is interesting to apply it to interacting galaxies,
too. Our study on major mergers includes a research of global properties of the
interacting system, namely the star formation rate and the star formation
efficiency, the evaporation and condensation rates, as well as the mass
exchange of distinct components, namely stars, diffuse ISM, and clouds.
Investigating these properties provides insight to interrelations between
various physical processes. The results indicate that the star formation
efficiency as well as the evaporation and condensation rates are influenced by
the interaction.

confirmed to be cluster members above these limits. 75% of these are detected
within 500 kpc of the cluster center. This result is inconsistent with a random
selection from bright, red sequence ellipticals at the > 99.999% level. All but
one of the XPSs are hosted by luminous ellipticals which otherwise show no
other evidence for AGN activity. These objects are unlikely to be highly
obscured AGN since there is no evidence for large amounts of X-ray or optical
absorption. The most viable model for these sources are low luminosity BL Lac
Objects. The expected numbers of lower luminosity FR 1 radio galaxies and BL
Lacs in our sample converge to suggest that very deep radio and X-ray images of
rich clusters will detect AGN in a large fraction of bright elliptical galaxies
in the inner 500 kpc. Because both the radio galaxies and the XPSs possess
relativistic jets, they can inject heat into the ICM. Using the most recent
scalings of P_jet ~ L_radio^{0.5} from Birzan et al. (2008), radio sources
weaker than our luminosity limit probably contribute the majority of the heat
to the ICM. If a majority of ICM heating is due to large numbers of low power
radio sources, triggered into activity by the increasing ICM density as they
move inward, this may be the feedback mechanism necessary to stabilize cooling
in cluster cores.

described in terms of inequality systems, in terms of vertex coordinates as

constituents. The wedge product construction can be described as an iterated
``subdirect product'' as introduced by McMullen (1976); it is dual to the
``wreath product'' construction of Joswig and Lutz (2005).
  One particular instance of the wedge product construction turns out to be
especially interesting: The wedge products of polygons with simplices contain
certain combinatorially regular polyhedral surfaces as subcomplexes. These
generalize known classes of surfaces ``of unusually large genus'' that first
appeared in works by Coxeter (1937), Ringel (1956), and McMullen, Schulz, and
Wills (1983). Via ``projections of deformed wedge products'' we obtain
realizations of some of the surfaces in the boundary complexes of 4-polytopes,
and thus in R^3. As additional benefits our construction also yields polyhedral
subdivisions for the interior and the exterior, as well as a great number of
local deformations (``moduli'') for the surfaces in R^3. In order to prove that
there are many moduli, we introduce the concept of ``affine support sets'' in
simple polytopes. Finally, we explain how duality theory for 4-dimensional
polytopes can be exploited in order to also realize combinatorially dual

cuprates, we consider a phenomenological model of a d-wave superconductor with
coexisting charge, spin or pair density wave order of various form and wave
vector. We study the evolution of the nodal structure of the quasiparticle
energy spectrum as a function of the amplitude of the coexisting order and
perform diagrammatic linear response calculations of the low-temperature
(universal-limit) thermal conductivity. The work described herein expands upon
our past studies, which focused on a particular unit-cell-doubling charge
density wave, generalizing our techniques to a wider class of coexisting order.
We find that the question of whether the nodes of the d-wave superconductor
survive amidst a reasonable level of coexisting order is sensitive to the form
and wave vector of the order. However, in cases where the nodes do become
gapped, we identify a signature of the approach to this nodal transition, in
the low-temperature thermal conductivity, that appears to be quite general. The
amplitude of this signature is found to be disorder-dependent, which suggests a
connection between the presence of coexisting order in the underdoped cuprates
and recent observations of deviations from universal (disorder-independent)
thermal conductivity in the underdoped regime.

from behavioral experiments. From a physical perspective, the entropy of the RT
distribution provides a model-free estimate of the amount of processing
performed by the cognitive system. In this way, the focus is shifted from the
conventional interpretation of individual RTs being either long or short, into
their distribution being more or less complex in terms of entropy. The new
approach enables the estimation of the cognitive processing load without
reference to the informational content of the stimuli themselves, thus
providing a more appropriate estimate of the cognitive impact of different
sources of information that are carried by experimental stimuli or tasks. The
paper introduces the formulation of the theory, followed by an empirical
validation using a database of human RTs in lexical tasks (visual lexical
decision and word naming). The results show that this new interpretation of RTs
is more powerful than the traditional one. The method provides theoretical
estimates of the processing loads elicited by individual stimuli. These loads
sharply distinguish the responses from different tasks. In addition, it
provides upper-bound estimates for the speed at which the system processes
information. Finally, I argue that the theoretical proposal, and the associated
empirical evidence, provide strong arguments for an adaptive system that
systematically adjusts its operational processing speed to the particular
demands of each stimulus. This finding is in contradiction with Hick's law,
which posits a relatively constant processing speed within an experimental
context.

Constraining the phase space distribution of NSs may help to characterize the

simulations of NS orbits, under different assumptions concerning the Galactic
potential and the distribution of progenitors and birth velocities. We study
the resulting phase space distributions, focusing on the statistical properties
of the NS populations in the disk and in the solar neighbourhood. Results. It
is shown that $\sim 80$ percent of NSs are in bound orbits. The fraction of NSs
located in a disk of radius 20 kpc and width 0.4 kpc is $\lesssim 20$ percent.
Therefore the majority of NSs populate the halo. Fits for the surface density

Specifically, we propose that a quantum Hall bilayer with nu = 1/2 per layer at

by exciton condensation of composite fermions. This phase has a number of
remarkable properties: the presence of `bonding' and `antibonding' composite
Fermi seas, compressible behavior with respect to symmetric currents, and
fractional quantum Hall behavior in the counterflow channel. Quantum

\Sigma$ to admit a maximal slice is that the Cauchy slice $\Sigma$ admit a
metric with nonnegative scalar curvature, $R\ge 0$. In this paper, the two
cases considered are the closed spatial manifold and the asymptotically flat
spatial manifold. Although most results here will apply in four or more
spacetime dimensions, this work will mainly consider 4-dimensional spacetimes.
For $\Sigma$ closed or asymptotically flat, all topologies are allowed by the
field equations. Since all $\Sigma$ occur as Cauchy slices of solutions to the
Einstein equations and most $\Sigma$ do not admit metrics with $R\ge 0$, it
follows that most globally hyperbolic spacetimes never admit a maximal slice,
i.e. a slice with zero mean extrinsic curvature. In particular, asymptotically
flat globally hyperbolic spacetimes which admit maximal slices are the
exception rather than the rule. The reason for this is due to topological
obstructions to constructing such slices. In the asymptotically flat case, this
will be shown by smooth compactification of the manifold in order to use the
results for spatially closed manifolds.

systems with uncertainties, including unknown parameters, internal and external
perturbations. Lyapunov stability theory is applied to prove that under some
conditions the drive-response systems can achieve synchronization with uniform
ultimate bound even though the bounds of uncertainties are not known exactly in
advance. The designed controllers contain only feedback terms and partial
nonlinear terms of the systems, and they are easy to implement in practice. The
Lorenz system and Chen system are chosen as the illustrative example to verify
the validity of the proposed method. Simulation results also show that the
present control has good robustness against different kinds of disturbances.

  Journal of Modern Physics B",,,,"nlin.CD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we investigate a master-slave synchronization scheme of two
n-dimensional non-autonomous chaotic systems coupled by sinusoidal state error
feedback control, where parameter mismatch exists between the external harmonic
excitation of master system and that of slave one. A concept of synchronization
with error bound is introduced due to parameter mismatch, and then the bounds
of synchronization error are estimated analytically. Some synchronization
criteria are firstly obtained in the form of matrix inequalities by the
Lyapunov direct method, and then simplified into some algebraic inequalities by
the Gerschgorin disc theorem. The relationship between the estimated
synchronization error bound and system parameters reveals that the
synchronization error can be controlled as small as possible by increasing the
coupling strength or decreasing the magnitude of mismatch. A three-dimensional
gyrostat system is chosen as an example to verify the effectiveness of these
criteria, and the estimated synchronization error bounds are compared with the
numerical error bounds. Both the theoretical and numerical results show that
the present sinusoidal state error feedback control is effective for the
synchronization. Numerical examples verify that the present control is robust
against amplitude or phase mismatch.

where nodes collaborate to relay messages to a common data collecting unit
(sink node). The study problem is, in the sense of graph theory, to find a
shortest path tree spanning a weighted graph. This is a well-studied problem
where for example Dijkstra's algorithm provides a solution for non-negative
edge weights. The present contribution shows by simulation examples that simple
modifications of known distributed approaches here can provide significant
improvements in performance. Phase transition phenomena, which are known to
take place in networks close to percolation thresholds, may explain these
observations. An initial method, which here serves as reference, assumes the
sink node starts organisation of the network (tree) by transmitting a control
message advertising its availability for its neighbours. These neighbours then
advertise their current cost estimate for routing a message to the sink. A node
which in this way receives a message implying an improved route to the sink,
advertises its new finding and remembers which neighbouring node the message
came from. This activity proceeds until there are no more improvements to
advertise to neighbours. The result is a tree network for cost effective
transmission of messages to the sink (root). This distributed approach has
potential for simple improvements which are of interest when minimisation of
storage and communication of network information are a concern. Fast
organisation of the network takes place when the number $k$ of connections for
each node ({\em degree}) is close above its critical value for global network
percolation and at the same time there is a threshold for the nodes to decide
to advertise network route updates.

accurate modeling of the traffic is often too complex and/or infeasible. The
goal is thus to design codes that perform close to the capacity of any network
(with arbitrary traffic) efficiently. In this context, random linear network
codes are known to be capacity-achieving while requiring a decoding complexity
quadratic in the message length. Chunked Codes (CC) were proposed by Maymounkov
et al. to improve the computational efficiency of random codes by partitioning
the message into a number of non-overlapping chunks. CC can also be
capacity-achieving but have a lower encoding/decoding complexity at the expense
of slower convergence to the capacity. In this paper, we propose and analyze a
generalized version of CC called Overlapped Chunked Codes (OCC) in which chunks
are allowed to overlap. Our theoretical analysis and simulation results show
that compared to CC, OCC can achieve the capacity with a faster speed while
maintaining almost the same advantage in computational efficiency.

we deal with special subfamily of T-nomial coefficients.
  The main aim of this note is to develop the theory of T-nomial coefficients
with the help of generating functions. The binomial-like theorem for T-nomials
is delivered here and some consequences of it are drawn. A new combinatorial
interpretation of T-nomial coefficients is provided and compared with the
Konvalina way of objects' selections from weighted boxes. A brief summary of

describe how the main observation models used in the SR literature deal with
motion, and we explain why they are not suited for non isometric motion. Then,
we propose an extension of the observation model by Elad and Feuer adapted to
affine motion. This model is based on a decomposition of affine transforms into
successive shear transforms, each one efficiently implemented by row-by-row or
column-by-column 1-D affine transforms.
  We demonstrate on synthetic and real sequences that our observation model
incorporated in a SR reconstruction technique leads to better results in the
case of variable scale motions and it provides equivalent results in the case
of isometric motions.

major issue in dynamic imaging. Reducing the acquisition time can be achieved
by using non-Cartesian and sparse acquisitions. The reconstruction of MR images
from these measurements is generally carried out using gridding that
interpolates the missing data to obtain a dense Cartesian k-space filling. The
MR image is then reconstructed using a conventional Fast Fourier Transform. The
estimation of the missing data unavoidably introduces artifacts in the image
that remain difficult to quantify.
  A general reconstruction method is proposed to take into account these
limitations. It can be applied to any sampling trajectory in k-space, Cartesian
or not, and specifically takes into account the exact location of the measured
data, without making any interpolation of the missing data in k-space.
Information about the expected characteristics of the imaged object is
introduced to preserve the spatial resolution and improve the signal to noise
ratio in a regularization framework. The reconstructed image is obtained by
minimizing a non-quadratic convex objective function. An original rewriting of
this criterion is shown to strongly improve the reconstruction efficiency.
Results on simulated data and on a real spiral acquisition are presented and
discussed.

arrives in its neighborhood and kills it. Several killing schemes are
considered. The arriving locations of positive and negative particles are

Doppler imaging where its specificity is twofold. First, only short noisy data
records are available (typically four sample long) and experimental constraints
may cause spectral aliasing so that measurements provide unreliable, ambiguous
information. Second, the frequency sequence is smooth. Here, this information
is accounted for by a Markov model and application of the Bayes rule yields the
a posteriori density. The maximum a postariori is computed by a combination of
Viterbi and descent procedures. One of the major features of the method is that
it is entirely unsupervised. Adjusting the hyperparameters that balance
data-based and prior-based information is done automatically by ML using an
EM-based gradient algorithm. We compared the proposed estimate to a reference
one and found that it performed better: variance was greatly reduced and
tracking was correct, even beyond the Nyquist frequency.

deals with spectral smoothness, in the regularization framework, while the
second one is devoted to time continuity, in the Kalman formalism. The present
paper proposes an original synthesis of the two contributions: a new
regularized criterion is introduced that takes both information into account.
The criterion is efficiently optimized by a Kalman smoother. One of the major
features of the method is that it is entirely unsupervised: the problem of
automatically adjusting the hyperparameters that balance data-based versus
prior-based information is solved by maximum likelihood. The improvement is
quantified in the field of meteorological radar.
