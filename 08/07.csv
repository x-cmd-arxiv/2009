sequence of spiral galaxies including grand design and barred spirals. Special
shapes such as ring galaxies with inward and outward arms are also described by
the analytic continuation of the same formula. The formula is r(phi) = A/log[B
tan(phi/2N)]. This function intrinsically generates a bar in a continuous,
fixed relationship relative to an arm of arbitrary winding sweep. A is simply a
scale parameter while B, together with N, determine the spiral pitch. Roughly,
greater N results in tighter winding. Greater B results in greater arm sweep
and smaller bar/bulge while smaller B fits larger bar/bulge with a sharper
bar/arm junction. Thus B controls the ""bar/bulge-to-arm"" size, while N controls
the tightness much like the Hubble scheme. The formula can be recast in a form
dependent only on a unique point of turnover angle of pitch - essentially a
1-parameter fit, aside from a scale factor. The recast formula is remarkable
and unique in that a single parameter can define a spiral shape with either
constant or variable pitch capable of tightly fitting Hubble types from grand
design spirals to late type large-barred galaxies. We compare the correlation
of our pitch parameter to Hubble type with that of the traditional logarithmic
spiral for 21 well-shaped galaxies. The pitch parameter of our formula produces
a very tight correlation with ideal Hubble type suggesting it is a good
discriminator compared to logarithmic pitch, which shows poor correlation here
similar to previous works. Representative examples of fitted galaxies are
shown.

wireless networks. First, a path loss model is considered, where the legitimate

processes with intensities $\lambda$ and $\lambda_e$, respectively. It is shown
that, as long as $\lambda_e/\lambda=o((\log n)^{-2})$, almost all of the nodes
achieve a perfectly secure rate of $\Omega(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}})$ for the
extended and dense network models. Therefore, under these assumptions, securing
the network does not entail a loss in the per-node throughput. The
achievability argument is based on a novel multi-hop forwarding scheme where
randomization is added in every hop to ensure maximal ambiguity at the
eavesdropper(s). Secondly, an ergodic fading model with $n$ source-destination
pairs and $n_e$ eavesdroppers is considered. Employing the ergodic interference
alignment scheme with an appropriate secrecy pre-coding, each user is shown to
achieve a constant positive secret rate for sufficiently large $n$. Remarkably,
the scheme does not require eavesdropper CSI (only the statistical knowledge is
assumed) and the secure throughput per node increases as we add more legitimate
users to the network in this setting. Finally, the effect of eavesdropper
collusion on the performance of the proposed schemes is characterized.

Experimentally available examples of such a system are single wall carbon

systems the hyperfine interaction between the nuclear spin and the conduction
electron spin is very weak, yet it triggers a strong feedback reaction that
results in an ordered phase consisting of a nuclear helimagnet that is
inseparably bound to an electronic density wave combining charge and spin
degrees of freedom. This effect can be interpreted as a strong renormalization
of the nuclear Overhauser field and is a unique signature of Luttinger liquid
physics. Through the feedback the order persists up into the millikelvin range.
A particular signature is the reduction of the electric conductance by the
universal factor 2.

functions at high redshift. I assume a simple power-law relationship between
galaxy mass and BH mass, as implied by BH mass measurements at low redshift,
and consider only evolution in the zero-point of the relation. I argue that one
can obtain a lower limit on the zero-point evolution by assuming that every
galaxy hosts a BH, shining at its Eddington rate. One can obtain an upper limit
by requiring that the number of massive BH at high redshift does not exceed
that observed locally. I find that, under these assumptions, and neglecting
scatter in the BH-galaxy mass relation, BH must have been a factor of about 2
times larger at z=1 and 5 to 6 times more massive relative to their host
galaxies at z=2. However, accounting for intrinsic scatter in the BH-galaxy
mass relationship considerably relaxes these constraints. With a logarithmic
scatter of 0.3 to 0.5 dex in black hole mass at fixed galaxy mass, similar to
estimates of the intrinsic scatter in the observed relation today, there are
enough massive BH to produce the observed population of luminous QSOs at z=2
even in the absence of any zero-point evolution. Adopting more realistic
estimates for the fraction of galaxies that host active BH and the Eddington
ratios of the associated quasars, I find that the zero-point of the BH-galaxy
mass relation at z=2 cannot be much more than a factor of two times larger than
the present-day value, as the number of luminous quasars predicted would exceed
the observed population.

their robustness for various sample sizes. We then apply these tests to a

use this statistic to classify a sample of the CNOC2 groups and find that 34 of
106 groups are inconsistent with an underlying Gaussian velocity distribution,
and thus do not appear relaxed. In addition, we compute velocity dispersion

i,J,H,K observations starting 2.3 hr after the burst with K=19.59+/-0.16 mag
and i=23.79+/-0.07 mag, but is absent in images obtained 1.3 years later.
Fading is also detected in the K-band between 2.8 and 3.7 hr at a 4-sigma
significance level. The optical/near-IR spectral index, beta_{O,NIR}=-2, is
much redder than expected in the standard afterglow model, pointing to either
significant dust extinction, A_{V,host}~2 mag, or a non-afterglow origin for
the near-IR emission. The case for extinction is supported by a shallow optical
to X-ray spectral index, consistent with the definition for ``dark bursts'',
and a normal near-IR to X-ray spectral index. Moreover, a comparison to the
optical discovery magnitudes of all short GRBs with optical afterglows
indicates that the near-IR counterpart of GRB070724A is one of the brightest to
date, while its observed optical emission is one of the faintest. In the
context of a non-afterglow origin, the near-IR emission may be dominated by a
mini-supernova, leading to an estimated ejected mass of M~10^-4 Msun and a
radioactive energy release efficiency of f~0.005 (for v~0.3c). However, the
mini-SN model predicts a spectral peak in the UV rather than near-IR,
suggesting that this is either not the correct interpretation or that the
mini-SN models need to be revised. Finally, the afterglow coincides with a star
forming galaxy at z=0.457, previously identified as the host based on its
coincidence with the X-ray afterglow position (~2"" radius). Our discovery of
the optical/near-IR afterglow makes this association secure.

the bright optical transient in NGC300, with the aim of getting independent
information on the explosion mechanism, the progenitor star and its
circumstellar environment.
  METHODS: Using VLT-FORS1 we have obtained low-resolution optical linear
spectropolarimetry of NGC300 OT2008-1 on two epochs, 48 and 55 days after the
discovery, covering the spectral range 3600--9330A.
  RESULTS: The data show a continuum polarization at a very significant level.
At least two separate components are identified. The first is characterized by
a strong wavelength dependency and a constant position angle (68.6+/-0.3
degrees), which is parallel to the local spiral arm of the host galaxy. The
second shows a completely different position angle (151.3+/-0.4) and displays a
mild but statistically significant evolution between the two epochs. While the
former is identified as arising in the interstellar dust associated with
NGC300, the latter is most likely due to continuum polarization by dust
scattering in the circumstellar environment. No line depolarization is detected
in correspondence of the most intense emission lines, disfavoring electron
scattering as the source of intrinsic polarization. This implies a very small
deviation from symmetry in the continuum-forming region. Given the observed
level of intrinsic polarization, the transient must be surrounded by a
significant amount of dust (>4x10^-5 Msun), asymmetrically distributed within a
few thousand AU. This most likely implies that one or more asymmetric outflow
episodes took place during the past history of the progenitor.

presented at the launch of the Challenge and five additional groups submitted
results during the 6 month competition. Participants analyzed 30 million
simulated galaxies with a range in signal to noise ratio, point-spread function
ellipticity, galaxy size, and galaxy type. The large quantity of simulations
allowed shear measurement methods to be assessed at a level of accuracy
suitable for currently planned future cosmic shear observations for the first
time. Different methods perform well in different parts of simulation parameter
space and come close to the target level of accuracy in several of these. A
number of fresh ideas have emerged as a result of the Challenge including a
re-examination of the process of combining information from different galaxies,
which reduces the dependence on realistic galaxy modelling. The image
simulations will become increasingly sophisticated in future GREAT challenges,
meanwhile the GREAT08 simulations remain as a benchmark for additional
developments in shear measurement algorithms.

significant error in stellar population synthesis (SPS) models, caused by
systematic uncertainties associated with the three fundamental stellar
atmospheric parameters; effective temperature T_eff, surface gravity g, and
iron abundance [Fe/H]. All SPS models rely on calibrations of T_eff, logg and
[Fe/H] scales, which are implicit in stellar models, isochrones and synthetic
spectra, and are explicitly adopted for empirical spectral libraries. We assess
the effect of a mismatch in scales between isochrones and spectral libraries
(the two key components of SPS models) and quantify the effects on 23 commonly
used diagnostic line indices. We find that typical systematic offsets of 100K
in T_eff, 0.15 dex in [Fe/H] and/or 0.25 dex in logg significantly alter
inferred absolute ages of simple stellar populations (SSPs) and that in some
circumstances, relative ages also change. Offsets in T_eff, logg and [Fe/H]
scales for a scaled-solar SSP produce deviations from the model which can mimic
the effects of altering abundance ratios to non-scaled-solar chemical
compositions, and could also be spuriously interpreted as evidence for a more
complex population, especially when multiple-index or full-SED fitting methods
are used. We stress that the behavior we find can potentially affect any SPS
models, whether using full integrated spectra or fitting functions to determine
line strengths. We present measured offsets in 23 diagnostic line indices and
urge caution in the over-interpretation of line-index data for stellar

at both low- and high-redshift, indicating a star-formation origin for the
features. Based on the ratio of aromatic to star-formation IR (SFIR)
luminosities for normal star-forming galaxies at z~1, we have constructed the
SFIR luminosity function (LF) of z~1 quasars. As we found earlier for
low-redshift PG quasars, these z~1 quasars show a flatter SFIR LF than do z~1
field galaxies, implying the quasar host galaxy population has on average a
higher SFR than the field galaxies do. As measured from their SFIR LF,
individual quasar hosts have on average LIRG-level SFRs, which mainly arise in
the circumnuclear regions. By comparing with similar measurements of
low-redshift PG quasars, we find that the comoving SFIR luminosity density in
quasar hosts shows a much larger increase with redshift than that in field
galaxies. The behavior is consistent with pure density evolution since the
average SFR and the average SFR/BH-accretion-rate in quasar hosts show little
evolution with redshift. For individual quasars, we have found a correlation
between the aromatic-based SFR and the luminosity of the nuclear radiation,
consistent with predictions of some theoretical models. We propose that type 1

states in PhLPPP:PCBM are more localized with a triplet character. An
absorption peak at 1.65 eV is observed in PhLPPP:PCBM blend in the PIA, which
may be converted to weakly-bound polaron-pairs, contributing to the enhancement

of a bound point mass HT, while incorporating the effects due to the
quadrupolar interactions between the binary orbits and dominant contributions
to the general relativistic periastron precession in the inner binary, reveals
that, at the present epoch, the orbital eccentricity of the binary MSP should
decrease for reasonable ranges in the HT parameters. The estimated decrements
in the orbital eccentricity of the inner binary are few parts in $10^{5}$,
substantially higher than the reported accuracies in the estimation of the

relativistic timing models for isolated binary pulsars. For wide ranges in the
allowed orbital parameters, the estimated rate of change in the eccentricity of

is located at a fixed site. We obtain analytically or numerically the mean
first-passage time (MFPT) for the trapping issue. In the limit of large network
order (number of nodes), for the whole class of networks, the MFPT increases
asymptotically as a power-law function of network order with the exponent
obviously different for different parameter $q$, which suggests that power-law
degree distribution itself is not sufficient to characterize the scaling
behavior of MFPT for random walks, at least trapping problem, performed on
scale-free networks.

under uniaxial and isotropic strains, respectively. The semi-metallic nature is
shown to persist up to a very large uniaxial strain of 30% except a very narrow
strain range where a tiny energy gap opens. As the uniaxial strain increases
along a certain direction, the Fermi velocity parallel to it decreases quickly
and vanishes eventually, whereas the Fermi velocity perpendicular to it
increases by as much as 25%. Thus, the low energy properties with small
uniaxial strains can be described by the generalized Weyl's equation while
massless and massive electrons coexist with large ones. The work function is
also predicted to increase substantially as both the uniaxial and isotropic
strain increases. Hence, the homogeneous strain in graphene can be regarded as
the effective electronic scalar potential.

Three self-similar dynamic inside-out core collapse models -- the conventional
polytropic model, the empirical hybrid model and the isothermal model -- for
star-forming molecular clouds are examined and compared. The isothermal model
cannot produce observed asymmetric double-peak molecular line profiles. The
conventional polytropic model, which gives flow velocity, mass density and
temperature profiles self-consistently, can produce asymmetric double-peak line
profiles for a core collapsing cloud. In particular, the blue peak is stronger
than the red peak, consistent with a broad class of molecular line profile
observations. The relative strengths of the blue and red peaks within a
molecular line profile are determined by the cloud temperature gradient. The
conventional polytropic model can be utilized to produce molecular line-profile
templates, for extracting dynamical information from line spectra of molecular
globules undergoing a gravitational core collapse. We show a sample fit using
the 140 GHz H$_2$CO emission line from the central region of the molecular
globule B335 by our model with $\gamma=1.2$. The calculation of line profiles

of all active nodes. However, supporting a MANET is a cost-intensive activity
for a mobile node. From a single mobile node perspective, the detection of
routes as well as forwarding packets consume local CPU time, memory,
network-bandwidth, and last but not least energy. We believe that this is one
of the main factors that strongly motivate a mobile node to deny packet
forwarding for others, while at the same time use their services to deliver its
own data. This behavior of an independent mobile node is commonly known as
misbehaving or selfishness. A vast amount of research has already been done for
minimizing malicious behavior of mobile nodes. However, most of them focused on
the methods/techniques/algorithms to remove such nodes from the MANET. We
believe that the frequent elimination of such miss-behaving nodes never allowed
a free and faster growth of MANET. This paper provides a critical analysis of
the recent research wok and its impact on the overall performance of a MANET.
In this paper, we clarify some of the misconceptions in the understating of
selfishness and miss-behavior of nodes. Moreover, we propose a mathematical
model that based on the time division technique to minimize the malicious
behavior of mobile nodes by avoiding unnecessary elimination of bad nodes. Our
proposed approach not only improves the resource sharing but also creates a
consistent trust and cooperation (CTC) environment among the mobile nodes. The
simulation results demonstrate the success of the proposed approach that
significantly minimizes the malicious nodes and consequently maximizes the
overall throughput of MANET than other well known schemes.

The galaxy sample is complete for galaxies with cold hydrogen masses above 10^8

evolution of galaxies in a Lambda-cold dark matter (LCDM) cosmology. The
evolving CDM-distribution was adopted from the Millennium Simulation, an N-body
CDM-simulation in a cubic box with a side length of 500/h Mpc. This side length
limits the coherence scale of our sky simulation: it is long enough to allow
the extraction of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) in the galaxy power
spectrum, yet the position and amplitude of the first acoustic peak will be
imperfectly defined. This sky simulation is a tangible aid to the design and
operation of future telescopes, such the SKA, the LMT, and ALMA. The results
presented in this paper have been restricted to a graphical representation of
the simulated sky and fundamental dN/dz-analyzes for peak flux density limited

be harder to detect at redshifts z>2 than predicted by a no-evolution model.

winds in short-period O+O-star binaries is investigated (potential non-thermal
emission is presently ignored). The calculations are based on three-dimensional
hydrodynamical models which incorporate gravity, the driving of the winds,
orbital motion of the stars, and radiative cooling of the shocked plasma. The
thermal emission arises from the stellar winds and the region where they
collide. We investigate the flux and spectrum from a variety of models as a
function of orbital phase and orientation of the observer, and compare to the
single star case. The emission from the wind-wind collision region (WCR) is
strongly dependent on its density and temperature, being optically thick in
radiative systems, and optically thin in adiabatic systems. The flux from
systems where the WCR is highly radiative, as investigated for the first time
in this work, can be over an order of magnitude greater than the combined flux
from identically typed single stars. This excess occurs over a broad range of
wavelengths from cm to sub-mm. In contrast, when the WCR is largely adiabatic,
a significant excess in the thermal flux occurs only below 100 GHz. Eccentric
systems may show order of magnitude or greater flux variability, especially if
the plasma in the WCR transitions from an adiabatic to a radiative state and
vice-versa - in such cases the flux can display significant hysteresis with
stellar separation. We further demonstrate that clumping can affect the
variability of radio lightcurves. We investigate the spectral index of the
emission, and often find indices steeper than +0.6. Our predictions are of
interest to future observations with the next generation of radio and sub-mm
telescopes (abridged).

optimal asymptotic average throughput as the existing designs (such as regular

Since then more than 750 nights of observation have been devoted to this
project. A sample of 30 RRab stars was extensively observed, and light-curve
modulation was detected in 14 cases. The 47% occurrence rate of the modulation
is much larger than any previous estimate. The significant increase of the
detected incidence rate is mostly due to the discovery of small-amplitude
modulation. Half of the Blazhko variables in our sample show modulation with so
small amplitude that definitely have been missed in the previous surveys. We
have found that the modulation can be very unstable in some cases, e.g. RY Com
showed regular modulation only during one part of the observations while during
two seasons it had stable light curve with abrupt, small changes in the
pulsation amplitude. This type of light-curve variability is also hard to
detect in other Survey's data. The larger frequency of the light-curve
modulation of RRab stars makes it even more important to find the still lacking
explanation of the Blazhko phenomenon. The validity of the [Fe/H](P,phi_{31})
relation using the mean light curves of Blazhko variables is checked in our
sample. We have found that the formula gives accurate result for
small-modulation-amplitude Blazhko stars, and this is also the case for
large-modulation-amplitude stars if the light curve has complete phase
coverage. However, if the data of large-modulation-amplitude Blazhko stars are
not extended enough (e.g. < 500 data points from < 15 nights), the formula may
give false result due to the distorted shape of the mean light curve used.

fully-developed turbulent gas flow from a thin layer of laminar liquid. Unlike
previous work, the turbulent base state velocity profile proposed here requires
only a specification of a flowrate or pressure drop, and no a posteriori choice
of parameters. Moreover, the base state contains sufficient detail such that it
allows for instability due to a viscosity-contrast mechanism (which turns out
to be dominant) as well as instability due to a critical-layer-type mechanism,
and it is validated against the experimental and numerical data available in
the literature. Furthermore, the effect of perturbations in the turbulent
stress distributions is investigated, and demonstrated, for the first time, to
be small for cases wherein the liquid layer is thin. The detailed modelling of
the liquid layer elicits two unstable modes, and mode competition can occur,
although in most cases the instability is due to the viscosity-contrast
mechanism. In particular, there is the possibility that surface roughness can
reduce the growth rate of the interfacial mode, and promote a liquid-layer
instability to the status of most dangerous mode. Our base-state model
facilitates a new definition of `slow' and `fast' waves. We use our linear
stability analysis to determine the factors that affect the wave speed and
demonstrate that the waves are `slow' according to the definition proposed
here. Finally, we compare our results with experimental data, and good

orbiting the hot subdwarf HD 149382 in 2.391 days at a distance of only about
five solar radii. Obviously the companion must have survived engulfment in the
red-giant envelope. Moreover, the substellar companion has triggered envelope
ejection and enabled the sdB star to form. Hot subdwarf stars have been
identified as the sources of the unexpected ultravoilet emission in elliptical
galaxies, but the formation of these stars is not fully understood. Being the
brightest star of its class, HD 149382 offers the best conditions to detect the
substellar companion. Hence, undisclosed substellar companions offer a natural
solution for the long-standing formation problem of apparently single hot

systems subject to decoherent interactions with the reservoir relax towards
their ground state in the weak coupling limit. Within the framework of quantum
master equations, this is formalized by the Born-Markov-secular (BMS)
approximation, where one obtains the system Gibbs state with the reservoir
temperature as a stationary state. When the solution to some problem is encoded
in the (isolated) ground state of a system Hamiltonian, decoherence can
therefore be exploited for computation. The computational complexity is then
given by the scaling of the relaxation time with the system size $n$.
  We study the relaxation behavior for local and non-local Hamiltonians that
are coupled dissipatively with local and non-local operators to a bosonic bath
in thermal equilibrium. We find that relaxation is generally more efficient
when coherences of the density matrix in the system energy eigenbasis are taken
into account. In addition, the relaxation speed strongly depends on the matrix
elements of the coupling operators between initial state and ground state.
  We show that Dicke superradiance is a special case of our relaxation models
and can thus be understood as a coherence-assisted relaxation speedup.

indicate spin relaxation times that are significantly shorter than the
theoretical predictions. We investigate experimentally whether these short spin
relaxation times are due to extrinsic factors, such as spin relaxation caused
by low impedance contacts, enhanced spin flip processes at the device edges or
the presence of an aluminium oxide layer on top of graphene in some samples.
Lateral spin valve devices using a field effect transistor geometry allowed for
the investigation of the spin relaxation as a function of the charge density,
going continuously from metallic hole to electron conduction (charge densities
of $n\sim 10^{12}$cm$^{-2}$) via the Dirac charge neutrality point ($n \sim
0$). The results are quantitatively described by a one dimensional spin
diffusion model where the spin relaxation via the contacts is taken into
account. Spin valve experiments for various injector/detector separations and
spin precession experiments reveal that the longitudinal (T$_1$) and the
transversal (T$_2$) relaxation times are similar. The anisotropy of the spin
relaxation times $\tau_\parallel$ and $\tau_\perp$, when the spins are injected
parallel or perpendicular to the graphene plane, indicates that the effective
spin orbit fields do not lie exclusively in the two dimensional graphene plane.
Furthermore, the proportionality between the spin relaxation time and the
momentum relaxation time indicates that the spin relaxation mechanism is of the
Elliott-Yafet type. For carrier mobilities of 2-5$\times 10^3$ cm$2^$/Vs and
for graphene flakes of 0.1-2 $\mu$m in width, we found spin relaxation times of
the order of 50-200 ps, times which appear not to be determined by the
extrinsic factors mentioned above.

Their impact rates frequently exceeded 10 min^-1. Surprisingly large impact
rates up to 100 min^-1 occurred in Aug/Sep 2000 when Galileo was at about 280

achieve this, we extend the puncture method to allow the construction of

starting from the formally exact path integral expression for the reduced

treatment in the inverse friction strength so that higher order quantum
corrections to the original quantum Smoluchowski equation [PRL 87, 086802

widely-spaced antennas. Such antenna configuration facilitates capturing the
inherent diversity gain due to independent signal dispersion by the target
scatterers. We consider a new MIMO radar framework for detecting a target that
lies in an unknown location. This is in contrast with conventional MIMO radars
which break the space into small cells and aim at detecting the presence of a
target in a specified cell. We treat this problem through offering a novel
composite hypothesis testing framework for target detection when (i) one or
more parameters of the target are unknown and we are interested in estimating
them, and (ii) only a finite number of observations are available. The test
offered optimizes a metric which accounts for both detection and estimation
accuracies. In this paper as the parameter of interest we focus on the vector
of time-delays that the waveforms undergo from being emitted by the transmit
antennas until being observed by the receive antennas. The analytical and
empirical results establish that for the proposed joint target detection and
time-delay estimation framework, MIMO radars exhibit significant gains over
phased-array radars for extended targets which consist of multiple independent
scatterers. For point targets modeled as single scatterers, however, the
detection/estimation accuracies of MIMO and phased-array radars for this
specific setup (joint target detection and time-delay estimation) are
comparable.

journal[J. Chem. Phys. 128,154510 (2008)], whether the residual entropy is real
or fictional. It is shown that the residual entropy loss conjecture (ELC) at
the glass transition, which results in a discontinuous entropy violates many
fundamental principles of classical thermodynamics, and also contradicts some
experimental facts. Assuming, as is common in the field, that glasses are in
internal equilibrium, we show that the continuity of enthalpy and volume at the
glass transition require the continuity of the Gibbs free energy and the
entropy, which contradicts ELC. It is then argued that ELC is founded on an
incorrect understanding of what it means for a glass to be kinetically trapped
in a basin and of the concept of probability and entropy. Once this
misunderstanding is corrected in our approach by the proper identification of
entropy as the ensemble entropy, which is in accordance with the principle of
reproducibility (see Sect. II), it follows immediately that the residual
entropy does not disappear in a kinetically frozen glassy state and all the
violations of thermodynamics disappear. We show that the temporal definition of
entropy over finite times does not make sense for glasses as it is not unique.
There is no loss of ergodicity and causality, contrary to some recent claims.

the decoding method deployed by the secondary receivers, we consider three

receiver decodes only its designated transmitter while suppressing the rest as
Gaussian interferers (single-user decoding). In the second case each secondary
receiver employs the maximum likelihood decoder (MLD) to jointly decode all
secondary transmissions, and in the third one each secondary receiver uses the
unconstrained group decoder (UGD). By deploying the UGD, each secondary user is
allowed to decode any arbitrary subset of users (which contains its designated
user) after suppressing or canceling the remaining users.

symmetry to protect the Zbb coupling from large corrections. This
""doublet-extended standard model"" adds a weak doublet of fermions (including a
heavy partner of the top quark) to the particle content of the standard model
in order to implement an O(4) x U(1)_X = SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R x P_{LR} x U(1)_X
symmetry that protects the Zbb coupling. This symmetry is softly broken to the
gauged SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y electroweak symmetry by a Dirac mass M for the new
doublet; adjusting the value of M allows us to explore the range of
possibilities between the O(4)-symmetric (M to 0) and standard-model-like (M to
infinity) limits. In this simple model, we find that the experimental limits on
the Zbb coupling favor smaller M while the presence of a potentially sizable
negative contribution to T strongly favors large M. A fit to all precision
electroweak data shows that the heavy partner of the top quark must be heavier
than about 3.4 TeV, making it difficult to search for at LHC. This result
demonstrates that electroweak data strongly limits the amount by which the
custodial symmetry of the top-quark mass generating sector can be enhanced
relative to the standard model. Using an effective field theory calculation, we
illustrate how the leading contributions to alpha T, alpha S and the Zbb
coupling in this model arise from an effective operator coupling right-handed
top-quarks to the Z-boson, and how the effects on these observables are
correlated. We contrast this toy model with extra-dimensional models in which
the extended custodial symmetry is invoked to control the size of additional
contributions to alpha T and the Zbb coupling, while leaving the standard model
contributions essentially unchanged.

magnetic fields, a variable {\em non-zero spin polarization} can be obtained by
controlling the asymmetric shape of the confinement potential. These results
suggest a new approach to produce spin polarized electron sources and we study
the dependence of this phenomenon on structural parameters and applied magnetic

explanation of our recent observations of a 0.5 conductance plateau (in units
of $2e^2/h$) in quantum point contacts made on InAs quantum-well structures.
