topological superconducting phases characterized by a non-zero Chern number.
More specifically, we consider a generic one-band Hamiltonian of spinless
fermions that is invariant under both time-reversal, $\mathbb{T}$, and a group
of rotations and reflections, $\mathbb{G}$, which is either the dihedral
point-symmetry group of an underlying lattice, $\mathbb{G}=D_n$, or the
orthogonal group of rotations in continuum, $\mathbb{G}={\rm O}(2)$. Pairing
symmetries are classified according to the irreducible representations of $
\mathbb{T} \otimes \mathbb{G}$. We prove a theorem that for any two-dimensional
representation of this group, a time-reversal symmetry breaking paired state is
energetically favorable. This implies that the ground state of any spinless
fermion Hamiltonian in continuum or on a square lattice with a singly-connected
Fermi surface is always a topological superconductor in the presence of
attraction in at least one channel. Motivated by this discovery, we examine
phase diagrams of two specific lattice models with nearest-neighbor hopping and
attraction on a square lattice and a triangular lattice. In accordance with the
general theorem, the former model exhibits only a topological $(p + ip)$-wave
state, while the latter shows a doping-tuned quantum phase transition from such
state to a non-topological, but still exotic $f$-wave superconductor.

membranes embedded into a spherically symmetric black hole spacetime with
arbitrary number of dimensions. Since the next to leading order corrections in
the effective brane action are quadratic in the brane thickness l, we adopt a
linear perturbation approach in l^2. The perturbations are general in the sense
that they are not restricted to the Rindler zone nor to the near-critical
solutions of the unperturbed system. As a result, an unexpected asymmetry in
the perturbed system is found. In configurations, where the brane does not
cross the black hole horizon, the perturbative approach does not lead to
regular solutions if the number of the brane's spacetime dimensions D>3. This
condition, however, does not hold for the horizon crossing solutions.
Consequently we argue that the presented perturbative approach breaks down for
subcritical type solutions near the axis of the system for D>3. Nevertheless,
we can discuss topology-changing phase transitions in cases when D=2 or 3, i.e.
when the brane is a 1-dimensional string or a 2-dimensional sheet,
respectively. For the general case, a different, non-perturbative approach
should be sought. Based on the energy properties of those branes that are
quasi-statically evolved from the equatorial configuration, we illustrate the
results of the phase transition in the case of a D=3 brane. It is found that
small thickness perturbations do not modify the order of the transition, i.e.
it remains first order just as in the case of vanishing thickness.

business. During the off-working hours, the computational capacities of these
networked computers are underused or unused. In order to utilize this
computational capacity an application has to be recoded to exploit concurrency
inherent in a computation which is clearly not possible for legacy applications
without any source code. This thesis presents the design an implementation of a
distributed middleware which can automatically execute a legacy application on
multiple networked computers by parallelizing it. This middleware runs multiple
copies of the binary executable code in parallel on different hosts in the
network. It wraps up the binary executable code of the legacy application in
order to capture the kernel level data access system calls and perform them
distributively over multiple computers in a safe and conflict free manner. The
middleware also incorporates a dynamic scheduling technique to execute the
target application in minimum time by scavenging the available CPU cycles of
the hosts in the network. This dynamic scheduling also supports the CPU
availability of the hosts to change over time and properly reschedule the
replicas performing the computation to minimize the execution time. A prototype
implementation of this middleware has been developed as a proof of concept of
the design. This implementation has been evaluated with a few typical case
studies and the test results confirm that the middleware works as expected.

neutron nearly at rest. The s-11 scaling of the cross section, as predicted by
the constituent counting rule for two nucleon photodisintegration, was observed
for the first time. The onset of the scaling is at a higher energy and the
cross section is significantly lower than for deuteron (pn pair)
photodisintegration. For photon energies below the scaling region, the scaled
cross section was found to present a strong energy-dependent structure not
observed in deuteron photodisintegration.

quasi-classical trajectories is proposed, which effectively avoids any binning

classical states are started in terms of angle-action variables to closely
match the quantum experimental conditions and later transformed into Cartesian
coordinates, following an algorithm very recently published [J. Chem. Phys.
130, 114103 (2009)]. Trajectories are then propagated using the 'association'
picture, i.e. an inverse dynamics simulation in the spirit of the exit-channel
corrected phase space theory of Hamilton and Brumer [J. Chem. Phys. 82, 595
(1985)], which is shown to be particularly convenient. Finally, an approximate
quasi-classical formula is provided which under general conditions can be used
to add possible rotational structures into the vibrationally-resolved
quasi-classical distributions. To introduce the method and illustrate its
capabilities, correlated translational energy distributions from recent
experiments in the photo-dissociation of ketene at 308 nm [J. Chem. Phys. 124,

algorithm reduces the total number of trajectories to integrate and allows for
fully theoretical predictions of experiments on polyatomics.

a power law function. For clusters in a wide range of galactic environments
this has resulted in fit indices near -2, but on average slightly steeper. A
fundamental property of the -2 power law function is that the luminosity of the
brightest object (L_max) scales linearly with the total number of clusters,
which is close to what is observed. This suggests that the formation of Young
Massive Clusters (YMCs) is a result of the size of the sample, i.e. when the
SFR is high it is statistically more likely to form YMCs, but no particular
physical conditions are required. In this contribution we provide evidence that
the LF of young clusters is not a -2 power law, but instead is curved, showing
a systematic decrease of the (logarithmic) slope from roughly -1.8 at low
luminosities to roughly -2.8 at high luminosities. The empirical LFs can be
reproduced by model LFs using an underlying cluster IMF with a Schechter type
truncation around M*=2x10^5 M_sun. This value of M* can not be universal since
YMCs well in excess of this M* are known in merging galaxies and merger
remnants. Therefore, forming super massive clusters (>10^6 M_sun) probably
requires conditions different from those in (quiescent) spiral galaxies and
hence is not only the result of a size-of-sample effect. From the vertical
offset a cluster formation efficiency of ~10% is derived. We find indications
for this efficiency to be higher when the SFR is higher.

cone angles less then 2{\pi} plays an important role in many problems in low
dimensional topology and in the geometrization of 3-manifolds. Furthermore,
various old conjectures dating back to Stoker about the moduli of convex
hyperbolic and Euclidean polyhedra can be reduced to the study of deformations
of cone-manifolds by doubling a polyhedron across its faces. This deformation
theory has been understood by Hodgson and Kerckhoff when the singular set has
no vertices, and by Wei{\ss} when the cone angles are less than {\pi}. We prove
here an infinitesimal rigidity result valid for cone angles less than 2{\pi},
stating that infinitesimal deformations which leave the dihedral angles fixed
are trivial in the hyperbolic case, and reduce to some simple deformations in
the Euclidean case. The method is to treat this as a problem concerning the
deformation theory of singular Einstein metrics, and to apply analytic methods
about elliptic operators on stratified spaces. This work is an important
ingredient in the local deformation theory of cone-manifolds by the second
author, see also the concurrent work by Wei{\ss}.

manner. A data collector (DC) should be able to reconstruct the entire data by
connecting to any k out of the n nodes and downloading all the data stored in

nodes. In a recent paper, Wu et al. have obtained an information theoretic
lower bound for the repair bandwidth. Also, there has been additional interest
in storing data in systematic form as no post processing is required when DC
connects to k systematic nodes. Because of their preferred status there is a
need to regenerate back any systematic node quickly and exactly. Replacement of
a failed node by an exact replica is termed Exact Regeneration.In this paper,
we consider the problem of minimizing the repair bandwidth for exact
regeneration of the systematic nodes. The file to be stored is of size B and
each node can store alpha = B/k units of data. A failed systematic node is
regenerated by downloading beta units of data each from d existing nodes. We
give a lower bound for the repair bandwidth for exact regeneration of the
systematic nodes which matches with the bound given by Wu et al. For d >= 2k-1
we give an explicit code construction which minimizes the repair bandwidth when
the existing k-1 systematic nodes participate in the regeneration. We show the
existence and construction of codes that achieve the bound for d >= 2k-3. Here
we also establish the necessity of interference alignment. We prove that the
bound is not achievable for d <= 2k-4 when beta=1. We also give a coding scheme
which can be used for any d and k, which is optimal for d >= 2k-1.

field follows the lobes seen in Halpha and soft X-ray emission. Dynamo action
and a disk wind can explain the X-shaped halo field. The nuclear
starburst-driven superwind may further amplify and align the halo field by
compression of the lobes of the expanding superbubbles. The disk wind is a
promising candidate for the origin of the gas in the halo and for the expulsion
of small-scale helical fields as requested for efficient dynamo action.

populations depend on velocity dispersion, luminosity and stellar mass. The
sample spans a large range in velocity dispersion (sigma from 30-300 km/s) and
in luminosity (M_R from -18.7 to -23.2). Estimates of age, total metallicity
(Z/H) and alpha-element abundance ratio (a/Fe) were derived from
absorption-line analysis, using single-burst models. Age, Z/H and a/Fe are all
correlated positively with velocity dispersion, but we also find significant
residual trends with luminosity: at given sigma, the brighter galaxies are
younger, less alpha-enriched, and have higher Z/H. At face value, these results
might suggest that the stellar populations depend on stellar mass as well as on
velocity dispersion. However, we show that the observed trends can be
reproduced by models in which the stellar populations depend systematically
only on sigma, and are independent of stellar mass Mstel. For age, the observed
luminosity correlation arises because young galaxies are brighter, at fixed
Mstel. For metallicity, the observed luminosity dependence arises because
metal-rich galaxies, at fixed mass, tend also to be younger, and hence
brighter. We find a good match to the observed luminosity correlations with Age
~ sigma^0.40, Z/H ~ sigma^0.35, a/Fe ~ sigma^0.20, where the slopes are close
to those found when fitting traditional scaling relations. We conclude that the
star formation and enrichment histories of galaxies are determined primarily by
the depth of their gravitational potential wells. The observed residual
correlations with luminosity do not imply a corresponding dependence on stellar
mass.

field are detected, corresponding to gradients in RM profiles transverse to the
jet. However, in many objects these profiles also display marked asymmetries
which are difficult to explain in simple helical jet models. Furthermore, in
some cases the RM profiles are strongly frequency and/or time dependent. Here
we show that these features may be naturally accounted for by including
relativistic helical motion in the jet model. In particular, we are able to
reproduce bent RM profiles observed in a variety of jets, frequency dependent
RM profile morphologies and even the time dependence of the RM profiles of
knots in 3C 273. Finally, we predict that some sources may show reversals in
their RM profiles at sufficiently high frequencies, depending upon the the
ratio of the components of jet sheath velocity transverse and parallel to the
jet. Thus, multi-frequency RM maps promise a novel way in which to probe the
velocity structure of relativistic outflows.

characteristic ways. Strong lens flux ratios have been used to constrain the
amount of dark matter substructure in lens galaxies, and various other
observables have been considered as additional probes of substructure. We study
the general theory of lensing with stochastic substructure in order to
understand how lensing observables depend on the mass function and spatial
distribution of clumps. We find that magnification perturbations are mainly
sensitive to the total mass in substructure projected near the lensed images;
when the source is small, flux ratios are not very sensitive to the shape of
the clump mass function. Position perturbations are mainly sensitive to a
characteristic clump mass scale, namely m_eff = <m^2>/<m>, with some mild
dependence on other mass moments when the spatial distribution is not uniform.
They have contributions from both ""local"" and ""global"" populations of clumps
(i.e., those projected near the images, and those farther away). Time delay
perturbations are sensitive to the same characteristic mass, m_eff, and mainly
driven by the global population of clumps. While there is significant scatter
in all lensing quantities, there are some non-trivial correlations that may
contain further information about the clump population. Our results indicate
that a joint analysis of multiple lens observables will offer qualitatively new
constraints on the mass function and spatial distribution of dark matter
substructure in distant galaxies.

of axisymmetric collapse is adequate, in the absence of nonaxisymmetric
instabilities, to illustrate the final state of the collapse. We also find that
quasi-periodic gravitational waves continue to be emitted after the quasinormal
mode frequency has decayed. We furthermore have found that when the newly
formed BH is almost extreme Kerr, the amplitude of the quasi-periodic
oscillation is enhanced during the late stages of the evolution. Geometrical
features, shock waves, and instabilities of the fluid are suggested as a cause
of this amplification behaviour. This alternative scenario for the collapse of

Butcher-Oemler effect, measuring the fraction of massive infrared-luminous
galaxies (K<K*+1.5, L_IR>5x10^10L_sun) within r_200, finding a steady increase
in the fraction with redshift from ~3% at z=0.02 to ~10% by z=0.30, and an rms
cluster-to-cluster scatter about this trend of 0.03. The best-fit redshift
evolution model is of the form f_SF ~ (1+z)^5.7, which is stronger redshift
evolution than that of L*_IR in both clusters and the field. We find that,
statistically, this excess is associated with galaxies found at large
cluster-centric radii, implying that the MIR Butcher-Oemler effect can be
explained by a combination of both the global decline in star-formation in the
universe since z~1 and enhanced star formation in the infall regions of
clusters at intermediate redshifts. This picture is supported by a simple
infall model based on the Millennium Simulation semi-analytic galaxy catalogs,
whereby star-formation in infalling galaxies is instantaneously quenched upon
their first passage through the cluster, in that the observed radial trends of
f_SF trace those inferred from the simulations. We also find that f_SF does not
depend on simple indicators of the dynamical state of clusters, including the
offset between the brightest cluster galaxy and the peak of the X-ray emission.
This is consistent with the picture described above in that most new
star-formation in clusters occurs in the infall regions, and is thus not
sensitive to the details of cluster-cluster mergers in the core regions.

mixtures of Gaussian-core particles, focusing on how tracer diffusivities and
static pair correlations depend on temperature, particle concentration, and
composition. At low particle concentrations, these systems behave like simple
atomic mixtures. However, for intermediate concentrations, the single-particle
dynamics of the two species largely decouple, giving rise to the following
anomalous trends. Increasing either the concentration of the fluid (at fixed
composition) or the mole fraction of the larger particles (at fixed particle
concentration) enhances the tracer diffusivity of the larger particles, but
decreases that of the smaller particles. In fact, at sufficiently high particle
concentrations, the larger particles exhibit higher mobility than the smaller
particles. Each of these dynamic behaviors is accompanied by a corresponding
structural trend that characterizes how either concentration or composition
affects the strength of the static pair correlations. Specifically, the dynamic
trends observed here are consistent with a single empirical scaling law that
relates an appropriately normalized tracer diffusivity to its pair-correlation
contribution to the excess entropy.

length, mass, curvature, stress-energy, etc., are nonanalytic in G at G=0, and
thus have expansions in powers of G whose terms are progressively more
divergent with increasing order. Since the gravity field's classical action is
inversely proportional to G, the path integral for gravity-field quantum
transition amplitudes shows that these depend on G only through the product hG,
and are nonanalytic in G at G=0 for the same reason that all quantum transition
amplitudes are nonanalytic in h at h=0, namely their standard oscillatory
essential singularity at the classical ""limit"". Thus perturbation expansions in
powers of G of gravity-field transition amplitudes are also progressively more
divergent with increasing order, and hence unrenormalizable. While their
perturbative treatment is impossible, the exceedingly small value of hG makes
the semiclassical treatment of these amplitudes extraordinarily accurate,
indeed to such an extent that purely classical treatment of the gravity field
ought to always be entirely adequate. It should therefore be fruitful to couple
classical gravity to other fields which actually need to be quantized: those
fields' ubiquitous, annoying ultraviolet divergences would thereupon undergo
drastic self-gravitational red shift, and thus be cut off.

reaching better understandings of the properties and capabilities of EMO

poorly when problems have many (e.g. five or more) objectives. One of the chief
reasons for this is believed to be that, in many-objective EMO search,
populations are likely to be largely composed of nondominated solutions. In
turn, this means that the commonly-used algorithms cannot distinguish between
these for selective purposes. However, there are methods that can be used
validly to rank points in a nondominated set, and may therefore usefully
underpin selection in EMO search. Here we discuss and compare several such
methods. Our main finding is that simple variants of the often-overlooked
Average Ranking strategy usually outperform other methods tested, covering
problems with 5-20 objectives and differing amounts of inter-objective
correlation.

a gate set capable of achieving universal control of any number of qubits,

pairs of qubits. Although gate sets have been demonstrated in several
technologies, they have as yet been tailored toward specific tasks, forming a
small subset of all unitary operators. Here we demonstrate a programmable

process tomography, we characterise the fidelity of our implementation for 160

we find that the inclusion of a perturbation term that explicitly violates the
axial symmetry significantly modifies the details of the resulting Bose
Einstein condensation. Systems with an originally axial symmetry must show an
intrinsic tendency to spontaneously violate this symmetry as soon as the
condensation sets in, and the phase transition at the respective critical field
may even become of first order. We can explain a number of features in the
experimental data of various insulating spin systems, such as a slightly
nonlinear magnetization near the critical field as well as hysteresis effects
and peculiarities in the energy-level scheme of TlCuCl3. We also offer a
consistent explanation for certain anomalies in the magnetocaloric effect and
in the magnetization of BaCuSi2O6 by assuming a spontaneous violation of axial
symmetry at the magnetic phase transition on an energy scale of about 1
micro-eV. The resulting anisotropy gap in the magnetic excitation spectrum,
that inevitably forms at the critical field of all such systems, lifts the
linear Goldstone mode and is therefore seriously limiting the lifetime of
magnetic condensates to a few nanoseconds at most.

any thermodynamic system. This implies the existence of a formulation of
de-Sitter thermodynamics based on the canonical ensemble. This paper reproduces
the de-Sitter thermodynamics in the canonical ensemble. The procedure is as
follows: We put a spherical wall at the center of de-Sitter spacetime, whose
mass is negligible and perfectly reflects the Hawking radiation coming from the
cosmological horizon. Then the region enclosed by the wall and horizon settles
down to a thermal equilibrium state, for which the Euclidean action is
evaluated and the partition function is obtained. The integration constant

""thermodynamic consistency"", which means that the state variables satisfy not
only the four laws of thermodynamics but also the appropriate differential
relations with thermodynamic functions; e.g. partial derivatives of the free
energy give the entropy, pressure, and so on. The special role of cosmological

in the development of spintronic devices. Novel structures and materials have
been studied in order to improve the performance of the magnetic tunnel
junctions (MTJs) performances and understand the fundamental physics in spin
torque transfer. The adiabatic spin torque effect, which is due to the spatial
non-uniformity of magnetic properties, has been predicted in theory and
demonstrated experimentally in magnetic nanowires. However, this important spin
torque has been rarely concerned in the magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ) because
of its extremely weak effect in conventional MTJs. This paper reports for the
first time a giant adiabatic spin torque in MTJ devices with a hybrid free
layer structure. The generation of the giant adiabatic spin torque was realized
through the introduction of a spatial magnetic non-uniformity in a hybrid free
layer along the current direction. It is observed that the giant adiabatic spin
torque can substantially promote the current-induced switching process in the
MTJ devices: the adiabatic spin torque can be larger than the in-plane spin
torque, which allows for the switching with a single-polar current under
different bias fields. Moreover, the adiabatic spin torque, which is
proportional to the level of spatial non-uniformity, increases during the
switching process. The observed effects are confirmed by numerical simulations.
These results have far-reaching implications for the future of high-density

1, the redundancy distribution of codons in the genetic code obeys MD
minimization principle; 2, the hydrophilic-hydrophobic distribution of amino
acids on the code table is global MD (GMD) minimal; 3, the standard genetic
code can be deduced from the adaptive minimization of GMD; 4, the variants of
the standard genetic code can be explained quantitatively by use of GMD
formalism and the general trend of the evolution is GMD non-increasing which
reflects the selection on the code. We have demonstrated that the redundancy
distribution of codons and the hydrophobic-hydrophilic (H-P) distribution of
amino acids are robust in the code relative to the mutational parameter, and
indicated that the GMD can be looked as a non-fitness function on the adaptive
landscape. Finally, an important aspect on the symmetry of the code
construction, the Yin-Yang duality is investigated. The Yin-Yang duality among
codons affords a sound basis for understanding the H-P structure in the genetic

the same species. With the advent of the infrared space observatories, this
definition has been extended to the mid-infrared. We show that the softness
parameters, as determined both in the optical and the mid-infrared wavelengths,
are sensitive to the effective temperature using a sample of data in both
spectral regimes. This is confirmed by comparing the data with a grid of
photoionization models, although no complete agreement has been found even for
different stellar model atmospheres. Finally, we show that both softness
parameters are consistent in the search for radial variations of the hardness
of the ionizing radiation of HII regions in the discs of spiral galaxies. We
find a range of trends, from galaxies showing pronounced gradients to those
showing very flat ones. Although the detectability and slope of these gradients
can be altered by the size and luminosity of the studied HII regions, it looks
that their existence is related to the mass and type of the galaxies and,
hence, to the roperties of the entire disc.

uranium equivalent are required to operate these reactors. For 15 years on
average only 2/3 of this fuel is provided by the uranium mines and 1/3 comes
from secondary resources. In this paper the situation concerning the secondary
resources at the beginning of the year 2009 is presented. The data used are
from the IAEA/NEA 2007 Red Book, ""Uranium Resources, Production and Demand"",
and from the World Nuclear Association (WNA).
  Our analysis shows that these civilian stocks will be essentially exhausted
within the next 5 years. This coincides roughly with the year 2013, when the
delivery of the 10000 tons of natural uranium equivalent from russian military
stocks to the USA will end. As the majority of the remaining civilian stocks,
about 30000 tons, are believed to be under the control of the US government and
american companies, it seems rather unlikely that the USA will share their own
strategic uranium reserves with other large nuclear energy users. All data
indicate that a uranium supply shortage in many OECD countries can only be
avoided if the remaining military uranium stocks from Russia and the USA,
estimated to be roughly 500000 tons are made available to the other countries.

to be answered is how the high-energy part of the spectrum evolves from the
low-hard to the high-soft state, given that they have very different
properties. Recent results obtained with RXTE and INTEGRAL have given
inconsistent results. With RXTE, we have found that the high-energy cutoff in
GX 339-4 during the transition first decreases (during the low-hard state),
then increases again across the Hard-Intermediate state, to become unmeasurable
in the soft states (possibly because of statistical limitations). We show
Simbol-X will be able to determine the spectral shape with superb accuracy. As
the high-energy part of the spectrum is relatively less known than the one
below 20 keV, Simbol-X will provide important results that will help out
understanding of the extreme physical conditions in the vicinity of a
stellar-mass black hole.

  For the O-rich stars silicates based on laboratory optical constants are
compared to ""astronomical silicates"". Overall, the grain type by Volk & Kwok
(1988) fit the data best. However, the fit based on laboratory optical
constants for the grains can be improved by abandoning the small-particle
limit. The influence of grain size, core-mantle grains and porosity are
explored.
  Relations between mass-loss rates and luminosity and pulsation period are
presented and compared to the predictions of evolutionary models, those by
Vassiliadis & Wood (1993) and their adopted mass-loss recipe, and those based
on a Reimers mass-loss law with a scaling of a factor of five. The Vassiliadis

deficiencies, in particular to the maximum adopted mass-loss rate.

for small or moderate fine-tuning. In our analysis of rare decays of K and B
mesons we find that due to the custodial symmetry the coupling of the Z boson
to right handed quarks yields the dominant contribution. This feature of the
model leads to distinct patterns and correlations that allow to distinguish the
model from other frameworks of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM).

the results, and we study this in some detail. We show that the traditional
background-field method, that is equivalent to a more traditional Feynman

general. One resolution of this is to use the Vilkovisky-DeWitt effective
action method, and this is presented here. Quantum gravity is shown to lead to
a contribution to the running charge not present when the cosmological constant

altering the scaling behaviour of gauge theories at high energies although our

constrain the bright end of the astronomical transient function, a systematic
search for transients that become bright enough to be noticed by the unaided
eye was conducted using the all-sky monitors of the Night Sky Live network. Two
fisheye continuous cameras (CONCAMs) operating over three years created a data
base that was searched for transients that appeared in time-contiguous CCD

general frequency of bright transients. To be detected, a transient must have
increased by over three visual magnitudes to become brighter than visual
magnitude 5.5 on the time scale of minutes to years. It is concluded that, on
the average, fewer than 0.0040 ($t_{dur} / 60$ seconds) transients with

compute a behavioural map that describes the average change of the direction

choose the side on which they evade, and show a side preference that is
amplified by mutual interactions. The predictions of a binary interaction model

recorded in a crowded street. Simulations generate two asymmetric lanes with
opposite directions of motion, in quantitative agreement with our empirical
observations. The knowledge of pedestrian behavioural laws is an important step
ahead in the understanding of the underlying dynamics of crowd behaviour and
allows for reliable predictions of collective pedestrian movements under

already been suggested to harbor a warm dust population in addition to a cold
dust ring located at about 140 AU. Archival data obtained with the VINCI
instrument at the VLTI are used to study the fringe visibility of the Fomalhaut
system at projected baseline lengths ranging from 4 m to 140 m in the K band. A
significant visibility deficit is observed at short baselines with respect to
the expected visibility of the sole stellar photosphere. This is interpreted as
the signature of resolved circumstellar emission, producing a relative flux of
0.88% +/- 0.12% with respect to the stellar photosphere. While our
interferometric data cannot directly constrain the morphology of the excess
emission source, complementary data from the literature allow us to discard an
off-axis point-like object as the source of circumstellar emission. We argue
that the thermal emission from hot dusty grains located within 6 AU from
Fomalhaut is the most plausible explanation for the detected excess. Our study
also provides a revised limb-darkened diameter for Fomalhaut (2.223 +/- 0.022

peaks of the two narrow systems are separated by 400--500 km/s in velocity

previously been interpreted as a signature of dual or binary active galactic
nuclei (AGNs), among other models. In the context of the binary scenario, SDSS
J131642.90+175332.5 is a particularly good candidate because not just one line
but all of its emission lines are double-peaked. However, we also discuss a
number of other scenarios which can potentially account for double-peaked
narrow emission lines, including projection effects, a two-sided outflow,
jet-cloud interactions, special narrow-line region (NLR) geometries (disks,
bars, or inner spirals), and a galaxy merger with only one AGN illuminating two
NLRs. We argue that the similarity of the emission-line ratios in both systems,
and the presence of the very unusual broad component at intermediate velocity,
makes a close pair of unrelated AGNs unlikely, and rather argues for processes
in a single galaxy or merger. We describe future observations which can
distinguish between these remaining possibilities.

depend on two parameters. The quantity $\Gamma_{V}$, measured recently in a
COMPASS experiment, gives the relation between these parameters. We can fix the
last unknown parameter using the ratio of up and down quark magnetic moments
which one can get from the fit to radiative vector meson decays. We calculate
antiquark polarizations with the orbital momenta of valence quarks that follow
from lattice calculations. The value of difference for up and down antiquark
polarizations obtained in our calculations is consistent with the result
obtained in a HERMES experiment.

heating of the solar wind in minima conditions. These waves are present in
regions of strong inhomogeneities in density or magnetic field (e. g., the
border between open and closed magnetic field lines). Using a 3-dimensional
Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model, we calculate the surface Alfven wave damping
contribution between 1-4 solar radii, the region of interest for both
acceleration and coronal heating. We consider waves with frequencies lower than
those that are damped in the chromosphere and on the order of those dominating
the heliosphere. In the region between open and closed field lines, within a
few solar radii of the surface, no other major source of damping has been
suggested for the low frequency waves we consider here. This work is the first
to study surface Alfven waves in a 3D environment without assuming a priori a
geometry of field lines or magnetic and density profiles. We determine that
waves with frequencies >2.8x10^-4 Hz are damped between 1-4 solar radii. In
quiet sun regions, surface Alfven waves are damped at further distances
compared to active regions, thus carrying additional wave energy into the
corona. We compare the surface Alfven wave contribution to the heating by a
variable polytropic index and find that it an order of magnitude larger than
needed for quiet sun regions. For active regions the contribution to the
heating is twenty percent. As it has been argued that a variable gamma acts as
turbulence, our results indicate that surface Alfven wave damping is comparable
to turbulence in the lower corona. This damping mechanism should be included
self consistently as an energy driver for the wind in global MHD models.

The ""factor of 2 controversy"" for bosons becomes clear - the factor is always
2. Decoherence is described by singlet states and they are unaffected by
spatially uniform clock fields. Spatial variations are critical, especially for
fermions which were previously thought to be immune to collision shifts. The
spatial variations lead to decoherence and a novel frequency shift that is not
proportional to the partial density of internal states.

summarize new arguments related to the learning modes of the brain in response
to sensory input that may be aggregated in three types: associative,
reorganizational, and quantum. The associative and reorganizational types are
quite apparent based on experimental findings; it is much harder to establish
that the brain as an entity exhibits quantum properties. We argue that the
reorganizational behavior of the brain may be viewed as inner adjustment
corresponding to its quantum behavior at the system level. Not only neural
structures but their higher abstractions also may be seen as whole entities. We
consider the dualities associated with the behavior of the brain and how these
dualities are bridged.

are thus good probes of new physics (NP) effects. We discuss in detail the
structure of the relevant SM effective Hamiltonian pointing out the presence of
nonlocal contributions which can be about \lambda^{-4} (m_c^2/m_t^2) ~ 30% of
the local operators (\lambda = 0.21 is the Cabibbo angle). The matrix elements
of the local operators are computed with little hadronic uncertainty by
relating them through flavor SU(3) to the observed \Delta S = 0 decays. We
identify a general NP mechanism which can lead to the branching fractions of
the b\to ss\bar d modes at or just below the present experimental bounds, while
satisfying the bounds from K-Kbar and B_{(s)}-Bbar_{(s)} mixing. It involves
the exchange of a NP field carrying a conserved charge, broken only by its
flavor couplings. The size of branching fractions within MFV, NMFV and general
flavor violating NP are also predicted. We show that in the future energy
scales higher than 10^3 TeV could be probed without hadronic uncertainties even
for b-> s and b-> d transitions, if enough statistics becomes available.

the {\em $\mu$-conjecture}, which implies the classification conjecture. In

play a crucial role concerning their robustness. Empiric and analytic results
have been obtained, based on asymptotic and mean-field approximations. Previous
work insisted on the fact that power-law degree distributions induce high
resilience to random failure but high sensitivity to attack strategies, while
Poisson degree distributions are quite sensitive in both cases. Then, much work
has been done to extend these results.
  We aim here at studying in depth these results, their origin, and
limitations. We review in detail previous contributions and give full proofs in
a unified framework, and identify the approximations on which these results
rely. We then present new results aimed at enlightening some important aspects.
We also provide extensive rigorous experiments which help evaluate the
relevance of the analytic results.
  We reach the conclusion that, even if the basic results of the field are
clearly true and important, they are in practice much less striking than
generally thought. The differences between random failures and attacks are not
so huge and can be explained with simple facts. Likewise, the differences in
the behaviors induced by power-law and Poisson distributions are not as
striking as often claimed.

where this number remains finite in the infinite module-size limit. In the
first case, results can be understood as a perturbation of a superposition of
semicircular spectral densities one would obtain for uncoupled modules. In the
second case, matters can be more involved, and depend in detail on inter-module
connectivities. For suitable parameters we even find near-triangular shaped
