They are the basis of many proposals aimed to solve a variety of
network-related problems such as resource location, network construction, nodes
sampling, etc. This interest on random walks is justified by their inherent
properties. They are very simple to implement as nodes only require local
information to take routing decisions. Also, random walks demand little
processing power and bandwidth. Besides, they are very resilient to changes on
the network topology.
  Here, we quantify the effectiveness of random walks as a search mechanism in
one-hop replication networks: networks where each node knows its neighbors'
identity/resources, and so it can reply to queries on their behalf. Our model
focuses on estimating the expected average search time of the random walk by
applying network queuing theory. To do this, we must provide first the expected
average search length. This is computed by means of estimations of the expected
average coverage at each step of the random walk. This model takes into account
the revisiting effect: the fact that, as the random walk progresses, the
probability of arriving to nodes already visited increases, which impacts on
how the network coverage evolves. That is, we do not model the coverage as a
memoryless process. Furthermore, we conduct a series of simulations to
evaluate, in practice, the above mentioned metrics. Our results show a very
close correlation between the analytical and the experimental results.

models we derive a distance of 450 +/- 23 parsecs to the cloud. At this
distance the cloud extends over roughly 80 pc and has a mass of approximately
10^5 solar masses, rivaling the Orion (A) Molecular Cloud as the largest and
most massive GMC in the solar neighborhood. Although surprisingly similar in
mass and size to the more famous Orion Molecular Cloud (OMC) the newly
recognized cloud displays significantly less star formation activity with more
than an order of magnitude fewer young stellar objects than found in the OMC,
suggesting that both the level of star formation and perhaps the star formation
rate in this cloud are an order of magnitude or more lower than in the OMC.
Analysis of extinction maps of both clouds shows that the new cloud contains
only 10% the amount of high extinction (A_K > 1.0 mag) material as is found in
the OMC. This, in turn, suggests that the level of star formation activity and
perhaps the star formation rate in these two clouds may be directly
proportional to the total amount of high extinction material and presumably
high density gas within them and that there might be a density threshold for
star formation on the order of a few times 10^4 hydrogen molecules per cc.

amplitudes in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory by going to the Coulomb phase of the
theory. The infrared divergences are regulated by masses obtained from a Higgs
mechanism, allowing us to work in four dimensions. The corresponding string
theory set-up suggests that the amplitudes have an exact dual conformal
symmetry. The latter acts on the kinematical variables of the amplitudes as
well as on the Higgs masses in an effectively five dimensional space. We
confirm this expectation by an explicit calculation in the gauge theory. A
consequence of this exact dual conformal symmetry is a significantly reduced
set of scalar basis integrals that are allowed to appear in an amplitude. For
example, triangle sub-graphs are ruled out. We argue that the study of
exponentiation of amplitudes is simpler in the Higgsed theory because
evanescent terms in the mass regulator can be consistently dropped. We
illustrate this by showing the exponentiation of a four-point amplitude to two
loops. Finally, we also analytically compute the small mass expansion of a
two-loop master integral with an internal mass.

disks over Cosmic time can be explored with the new generation of radio
telescopes, notably the SKA, and its precursors, as accurately as with the
Hubble Space Telescope for stellar disks. Since the atomic hydrogen gas is the
building block of these disks, it should trace their formation accurately.
Morphology of HI disks can now equally be quantified over Cosmic time. In
studies of HST deep fields, the optical or UV morphology of high-redshift
galaxy disks have been characterized using a few quantities: concentration (C),
asymmetry (A), smoothness (S), second-order-moment (M20), the GINI coefficient
(G), and Ellipticity (E). We have applied these parameters across wavelengths
and compared them to the HI morphology over the THINGS sample. NGC 3184, an
unperturbed disk, and NGC 5194, the canonical 3:1 interaction, serve as
examples for quantified morphology. We find that morphology parameters
determined in HI are as good or better a tracer of interaction compared to
those in any other wavelength, notably in Asymmetry, Gini and M20. This opens
the possibility of using them in the parameterization pipeline for SKA
precursor catalogues to select interacting or harassed galaxies from their HI
morphology. Asymmetry, Gini and M20 may be redefined for use on data-cubes
rather than HI column density image.

converged to 8 +/- 1 solar masses, from direct detections of red supergiant
progenitors of II-P SNe and the most massive white dwarf progenitors, although
this value is model dependent. It appears that most type Ibc supernovae arise
from moderate mass interacting binaries. The highly energetic, broad-lined Ic
supernovae are likely produced by massive, Wolf-Rayet progenitors. There is
some evidence to suggest that the majority of massive stars above ~20 solar
masses may collapse quietly to black-holes and that the explosions remain
undetected. The recent discovery of a class of ultra-bright type II supernovae
and the direct detection of some progenitor stars bearing luminous blue
variable characteristics suggests some very massive stars do produce highly
energetic explosions. The physical mechanism is open to debate and these SNe
pose a challenge to stellar evolutionary theory.

anyonic quasiparticles exhibiting richer statistical behaviours. An exciting
proposal for quantum computation is to employ anyonic statistics to manipulate
information. Since such statistical evolutions depend only on topological
characteristics, the resulting computation is intrinsically resilient to
errors. So-called non-Abelian anyons are most promising for quantum
computation, but their physical realization may prove to be complex. Abelian
anyons, however, are easier to understand theoretically and realize
experimentally. Here we show that complex topological memories inspired by
non-Abelian anyons can be engineered in Abelian models. We explicitly
demonstrate the control procedures for the encoding and manipulation of quantum

communication to characterize the network, for instance to estimate the network
topology and to localize random or adversarial glitches. Under the setting of
linear network coding this work provides a comprehensive study of passive
network tomography in the presence of network (random or adversarial) glitches.
To be concrete, this work is developed along two directions: 1. Tomographic
upper and lower bounds (i.e., the most adverse conditions in each problem
setting under which network tomography is possible, and corresponding schemes
(computationally efficient, if possible) that achieve this performance) are
presented for random linear network coding (RLNC). We consider RLNC designed
with common randomness, i.e., the receiver knows the random code-books all
nodes. (To justify this, we show an upper bound for the problem of topology
estimation in networks using RLNC without common randomness.) In this setting
we present the first set of algorithms that characterize the network topology
exactly. Our algorithm for topology estimation with random network errors has
time complexity that is polynomial in network parameters. For the problem of
network error localization given the topology information, we present the first
computationally tractable algorithm to localize random errors, and prove it is
computationally intractable to localize adversarial errors. 2. New network
coding schemes are designed that improve the tomographic performance of RLNC
while maintaining the desirable low-complexity, throughput-optimal, distributed
linear network coding properties of RLNC. In particular, we design network
codes based on Reed-Solomon codes so that a maximal number of adversarial
errors can be localized in a computationally efficient manner even without the
information of network topology.

follow the collapsing gas in the center of the minihalo up to number densities

initial hydrostatic core, which we represent as a growing sink particle, in
improved physical detail. The accretion process, and in particular its
termination, governs the final masses that were reached by the first stars. The
primordial initial mass function (IMF), in turn, played an important role in
determining to what extent the first stars drove early cosmic evolution. We
continue our simulation for 5000 yr after the first sink particle has formed.
During this time period, a disk-like configuration is assembled around the
first protostar. The disk is gravitationally unstable, develops a pronounced
spiral structure, and fragments into several other protostellar seeds. At the
end of the simulation, a small multiple system has formed, dominated by a
binary with masses ~ 40 M_Sun and ~ 10 M_Sun. If Pop III stars were to form
typically in binaries or small multiples, the standard model of primordial star
formation, where single, isolated stars are predicted to form in minihaloes,

December 2006. The main aim of this work is to derive model-independent
constraints on the origin of the X-ray emission and on the nature of the
central engine in 3C 390.3. On timescales of the order of few hours, probed by
uninterrupted XMM light curves, the flux of 3C 390.3 is consistent with being
constant in all energy bands. On longer timescales, probed by the 2-day RXTE
and Suzaku observations, the flux variability becomes significant. The latter
observation confirms that the spectral variability behavior of 3C 390.3 is
consistent with the spectral evolution observed in radio-quiet Seyfert
galaxies: the spectrum softens as the source brightens. The correlated
variability between soft and hard X-rays, observed during the Suzaku exposure
and between the 2 XMM pointings, taken 1 week apart, argues against scenarios
characterized by the presence of two distinct variable components in the 0.5-10
keV X-ray band. A detailed PSD analysis carried out over five decades in
frequency suggests the presence of a break at T_br~43 days at a 92% confidence
level. This is the second tentative detection of a PSD break in a radio-loud,
non-jet dominated AGN, after the BLRG 3C120, and appears to be in general
agreement with the relation between T_br, M_BH, and L_bol, followed by Seyfert
galaxies. Our results indicate that the X-ray variability properties of 3C
390.3 are broadly consistent with those of radio-quiet AGN, suggesting that the
X-ray emission mechanism in 3C 390.3 is similar to that of nearby Seyfert
galaxies without any significant contribution from a jet component.

between any pair of communicating nodes, S and T, is limited by the S-T minimum

make use of these S-T paths in enhancing the survivability of the S-T
information flow. This is usually accomplished by using a subset of these paths
to forward redundant data units or combinations (if network coding is allowed)
from S to T. Therefore, this enhancement in survivability reduces the useful
S-T information rate. In this paper we present a new way to enhance the
survivability of the S-T information flow without compromising the maximum
achievable S-T information rate. To do this, bottleneck links (in the min-cut)
should only forward useful information, and not redundant data units. We
introduce the idea of extra source or destination connectivity with respect to
a certain S-T max-flow, and then we study two problems: namely, pre-cut
protection and post-cut protection. Although our objective in both problems is
the same, where we aim to maximize the number of protected paths, our analysis
shows that the nature of these two problems are very different, and that the
pre-cut protection problem is much harder. Specifically, we prove the hardness
of the pre-cut protection problem, formulate it as an integer linear program,
and propose a heuristic approach to solve it. Simulations show that the
performance of the heuristic is acceptable even on relatively large networks.
In the post-cut problem we show that all the data units, forwarded by the
min-cut edges not incident to T, can be post-cut-protected.

method uses a pressure-based model for the H2/HI-ratio of the Interstellar
Medium, applied to ~3*10^7 virtual galaxies in the Millennium Simulation. We
predict that, on average, the HI-surface density of these galaxies saturates at
Sigma_HI<10 Msun/pc^2 at all redshifts (z), while H2-surface densities evolve
dramatically as Sigma_H2(1+z)^2.4. This scaling is dominated by a (1+z)^2
surface brightness scaling originating from the (1+z)^-1 size scaling of
galaxies at high z. Current measurements of Sigma_H2 at high z, derived from
CO-observations, tend to have even higher values, which can be quantitatively
explained by a selection bias towards merging systems. However, despite the
consistency between our high-z predictions and the sparse empirical data, we
emphasize that the empirical data potentially suffer from serious selection
biases and that the semi-analytic models remain in many regards uncertain. As a
case study, we investigate the cosmic evolution of simulated galaxies, which
resemble the Milky Way at z=0. We explicitly predict their HI- and

  Aims: The main aim of the observations is to study the nature of the diffuse
radio emission in the galaxy cluster ZwCl 2341.1+0000.
  Methods: We have carried out GMRT 610, 241, and 157 MHz continuum

X-ray and optical data of the cluster.
  Results: The GMRT observations show the presence of a double peripheral radio

the northern relic and -0.76 \pm 0.17 for the southern relic respectively. We
have derived values of 0.48-0.93 microGauss for the equipartition magnetic
field strength. The relics are probably associated with an outwards traveling

Evidence of it comes from the strange behaviour of the early ""afterglow"", seen

This difference makes it hard to explain both the optical and the X-ray

One can well be the standard emission from the forward shock of the fireball

their observed high-energy properties offer a sharp contrast: While GRB 031203
was detected as a short 40-s burst with a spectrum peaking at E_peak > 190 keV,
XRF 060218 was a T_90 ~ 2100-s long, smoothly-evolving burst with peak energy

fluence comparable to or greater than that of the prompt gamma-ray event.
Taking this observation as our starting point, we investigate the likely
properties of the X-ray blast from GRB 031203 via detailed modeling of the XMM
data, discovering a third halo due to scattering off a more distant dust sheet
at d_3 = 9.94 +/- 0.39 kpc, and constraining the timing of the X-ray blast
relative to the GRB trigger time to be t_0 = 11 +/- 417 s. Using our

bright X-ray flare, as in GRB 050502B, or shock breakout event, as in XRF

the added possibility that XRF 060218 may have manifested an episode of bright
gamma-ray emission prior to the burst observed by Swift, in which case GRB
031203 and XRF 060218 would be ""cosmic twin"" explosions with nearly identical

These new MACHOs are a powerful probe into the nature of dark matter and
physics in the high energy Universe. Non-Gaussian energy-density fluctuations
produced at phase transitions (e.g., QCD) or by features in the inflaton
potential can trigger primordial black hole (PBH) formation if their amplitudes
are delta > 30%. We show that a PBH accumulates over time a sufficiently
massive and compact minihalo to be able to modify or dominate its microlensing
magnification light curve. Perturbations of amplitude 0.03% < delta < 30% are
too small to form PBHs, but can nonetheless seed the growth of ultracompact
minihalos. Thus, the likelihood of ultracompact minihalos as MACHOs is greater
than that of PBHs. In addition, depending on their mass, they may be sites of
formation of the first PopIII stars. Ultracompact minihalos and PBHs produce a
microlensing light curve that can be distinguished from that of a ""point-like""
object if high-quality photometric data are taken for a sufficiently long time

quarks should lead to negligible screening of electric field while magnetic
screening remains strong. The consequence of this should be existence of a
""corona"" of the QGP, in a way similar to that of the Sun, in which electric
fields influence propagation of perturbations and even form metastable flux
tubes. The natural tool for its description is (dual) magnetohydrodynamics:
among observable consequences is splitting of sound into two modes, with larger

pressure-stabilized flux tubes. Remarkably, recent experimental discoveries at

turn to a more general dimension-free ball B_L, called a ""pencil ball"",
associated with a homogeneous linear pencil L(x):= A_1 x_1 + ... + A_m x_m,

is the direct sum of L' with an NC analytic map of the pencil ball into the
ball. That is, pencil ball maps are simple, in contrast to the classical result
of D'Angelo on such analytic maps in C^m. To prove our main theorem, this paper
uses the results of our previous paper mentioned above plus entirely different

successfully modelled with all of the mass initially confined to a narrow
annulus between 0.7 and 1.0 AU. With this configuration, analogues of Mercury
and Mars often form from the collisional evolution of material diffusing out of
the annulus under the scattering of the forming Earth and Venus analogues. The
final systems also possess eccentricities and inclinations that match the
observations, without recourse to dynamical friction from remnant small body
populations. Finally, the characteristic assembly timescale for Earth analogues
is rapid in this model, and consistent with cosmochemical models based on the
$^{182}$Hf--$^{182}$W isotopes. The agreement between this model and the
observations suggests that terrestrial planet systems may also be formed in
`planet traps', as has been proposed recently for the cores of giant planets in
our solar system and others.

Information Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The performance of estimating the common support for jointly sparse signals
based on their projections onto lower-dimensional space is analyzed. Support
recovery is formulated as a multiple-hypothesis testing problem. Both upper and
lower bounds on the probability of error are derived for general measurement
matrices, by using the Chernoff bound and Fano's inequality, respectively. The
upper bound shows that the performance is determined by a quantity measuring
the measurement matrix incoherence, while the lower bound reveals the
importance of the total measurement gain. The lower bound is applied to derive
the minimal number of samples needed for accurate direction-of-arrival (DOA)
estimation for a sparse representation based algorithm. When applied to
Gaussian measurement ensembles, these bounds give necessary and sufficient
conditions for a vanishing probability of error for majority realizations of
the measurement matrix. Our results offer surprising insights into sparse
signal recovery. For example, as far as support recovery is concerned, the
well-known bound in Compressive Sensing with the Gaussian measurement matrix is
generally not sufficient unless the noise level is low. Our study provides an
alternative performance measure, one that is natural and important in practice,
for signal recovery in Compressive Sensing and other application areas
exploiting signal sparsity.

three body interaction to Coulomb, the ground state at filling factor $\nu=2/5$
evolves continuously from the so-called Gaffnian wave function to the composite
fermion wave function, but the quasiholes alter their character in a
nonperturbative manner. This is attributed to the fact that the Coulomb
interaction opens a gap in the Gaffnian quasihole sector, pushing many of the
states to very high energies. Interestingly, the states below the gap are found
to have a one-to-one correspondence with the composite fermion theory,
suggesting that the Gaffnian model contains composite fermions, and that the
Gaffnian quasiholes are unstable to the formation of composite fermions when a
two-body interaction term is switched on. General implications of this study

while it increases for bi-layer/tri-layer graphene. This can be explained by
the different density of states in mono-layer and bi-layer/tri-layer graphenes.
In mono-layer, the mobility also decreases with increasing temperature
primarily due to surface polar substrate phonon scattering. In
bi-layer/tri-layer graphene, on the other hand, the mobility increases with
temperature because the field of the substrate surface phonons is effectively
screened by the additional graphene layer(s) and the mobility is dominated by
Coulomb scattering.

wide range in halo mass (10E12.9 to 10E15.3 Msun/h), and selected from each of
four redshift epochs (z=0, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5). We find that clusters at all
examined redshifts have accreted a significant fraction of their final galaxy
populations through galaxy groups. A 10E14.5 Msun/h mass cluster at z=0 has, on
average, accreted ~ 40% of its galaxies (Mstellar > 10E9 Msun/h) from halos
with masses greater than 10E13 Msun/h. Further, the galaxies which are accreted
through groups are more massive, on average, than galaxies accreted through
smaller halos or from the field population. We find that at a given epoch, the
fraction of galaxies accreted from isolated environments is independent of the
final cluster or group mass. In contrast, we find that observing a cluster of
the same halo mass at each redshift epoch implies different accretion rates of
isolated galaxies, from 5-6 % per Gyr at z=0 to 15% per Gyr at z=1.5. We find
that combining the existence of a Butcher Oemler effect at z=0.5 and the
observations that galaxies within groups display significant environmental
effects with galaxy accretion histories justifies striking conclusions. Namely,
that the dominant environmental process must begin to occur in halos of 10E12
-- 10E13 Msun/h, and act over timescales of > 2 Gyrs. This argues in favor of a
mechanism like ""strangulation"", in which the hot halo of a galaxy is stripped
upon infalling into a more massive halo . This simple model predicts that by
z=1.5 galaxy groups and clusters will display little to no environmental
effects.

(IMBHs, massive black holes with a mass ranging between $10^2$ and $10^4

attention. This is at least partially due to the fact that if the binary is
hard enough to evolve to the phase at which it will start emitting
gravitational waves (GWs) efficiently, there is a good probability that it will
be detectable by future space-borne detectors like LISA. We study this
evolution in the presence of rotation in the cluster. The eccentricity is
strongly connected to the initial IMBHs velocities, and values of $\sim 0.7$ up
to 0.9 are reached for low initial velocities, while almost circular orbits
result if the initial velocities are increased. A Monte Carlo study indicates
that these sources will be detectable by a detector such as LISA with median
signal to noise ratios of between 10 and 20 over a three year period, although
some events had signal to noise ratios of 300 or greater. Furthermore, one
should also be able to estimate the chirp-mass with median fractional errors of
$10^{-4}$, reduced mass on the order of $10^{-3}$ and luminosity distance on
the order of $10^{-1}$. Finally, these sources will have a median angular
resolution in the LISA detector of about 3 square degrees, putting events
firmly in the field of view of future electromagnetic detectors such as LSST.

beyond 10 AU, invokes low-frequency, oblique, Alfven-wave turbulence. Because
small-scale oblique Alfven waves (kinetic Alfven waves) are compressive, the
measured density fluctuations in the solar wind place an upper limit on the
amplitude of kinetic Alfven waves and hence an upper limit on the rate at which
the solar wind can be heated by low-frequency, Alfvenic turbulence. We evaluate
this upper limit for both coronal holes at 5 solar radii and in the near-Earth
solar wind. At both radii, the upper limit we find is consistent with models in
which the solar wind is heated by low-frequency Alfvenic turbulence. At 1 AU,
the upper limit on the turbulent heating rate derived from the measured density
fluctuations is within a factor of 2 of the measured solar wind heating rate.
Thus if low-frequency Alfvenic turbulence contributes to heating the near-Earth
solar wind, kinetic Alfven waves must be one of the dominant sources of solar
wind density fluctuations at frequencies of order 1 Hz. We also present a
simple argument for why density fluctuation measurements do appear to rule out
models in which the solar wind is heated by non-turbulent high-frequency waves
``sweeping'' through the ion-cyclotron resonance, but are compatible with
heating by low-frequency Alfvenic turbulence.

asymmetric-energy B Factory. From a sample of D0 and D0bar decays where the
inital flavor of the decaying meson is not determined, we obtain yCP = [1.12
+/- 0.26 (stat) +/- 0.22 (sys)]%, which excludes the no-mixing hypothesis at
3.3 sigma, including both statistical and systematic uncertainties. This result
is in good agreement with a previous Babar measurement of yCP obtained from a
sample of D*+->D0pi+ events, where the D0 decays to K-pi+, K+K-, and pi+pi-,
which is disjoint with the untagged D0 events used here. Combining the two
results taking into account statistical and systematic uncertainties, where the
systematic uncertainties are assumed to be 100% correlated, we find yCP = [1.16

the observed dynamics do not require that globular clusters are dark matter

small oscillations of the pendulum and small intervals of time, the dynamics of
the pendulum can be approximated by the dynamics of the harmonic oscillator. We
study the dynamics of a family of mechanical systems that includes the pendulum
at small neighbourhoods of the equilibrium but after long intervals of time so
that the second order term of the period map can no longer be neglected. We
analyze such dynamical behaviour through a renormalization scheme acting on the
dynamics of this family of mechanical systems. The main theorem states that the
asymptotic limit of this renormalization scheme is universal: it is the same
for all the elements in the considered class of mechanical systems. As a
consequence, we obtain an universal asymptotic focal decomposition for this

important cases. In the spherically symmetric, static case of a gravitating
mass, the equations also admit an approximate solution that closely resembles
the Reissner-Nordstrom metric. Furthermore, for weak gravitational fields, a
Yukawa-type modification to the Newtonian acceleration law can be obtained,
which can be used to model a range of astronomical observations. Without
nonbaryonic dark matter, MOG provides good agreement with the data for galaxy
rotation curves, galaxy cluster masses, and gravitational lensing, while
predicting no appreciable deviation from Einstein's predictions on the scale of
the solar system. Another solution of the field equations is obtained for the
case of a a spatially homogeneous, isotropic cosmology. MOG predicts an
accelerating universe without introducing Einstein's cosmological constant; it
also predicts a CMB acoustic power spectrum and a mass power spectrum that are
consistent with observations without relying on non-baryonic dark matter.
Increased sensitivity in future observations or space-based experiments may be
sufficient to distinguish MOG from other theories, notably the LCDM ""standard

  Hamiltonians",,,,,"math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A theory of transformation is presented for the diagonalization of a
Hamiltonian that is quadratic in creation and annihilation operators or in
coordinates and momenta. It is the systemization and theorization of Dirac and
Bogoliubov-Valatin transformations, and thus provides us an operational
procedure to answer, in a direct manner, the questions as to whether a
quadratic Hamiltonian is diagonalizable, whether the diagonalization is unique,
and how the transformation can be constructed if the diagonalization exists.
The underlying idea is to consider the dynamic matrix. Each quadratic
Hamiltonian has a dynamic matrix of its own. The eigenvalue problem of the
dynamic matrix determines the diagonalizability of the quadratic Hamiltonian
completely. In brief, the theory ascribes the diagonalization of a quadratic
Hamiltonian to the eigenvalue problem of its dynamic matrix, which is familiar
to all of us. That makes it much easy to use. Applications to various physical
systems are discussed, with especial emphasis on the quantum fields, such as
Klein-Gordon field, phonon field, etc..

robust platforms for both quantum information processing and cavity quantum
electrodynamics (QED). An inherent feature of such solid-state cavity QED
systems is the presence of electron-phonon interactions, which distinguishes
these systems from conventional atomic cavity QED. Understanding the effects of
electron-phonon interactions on these systems is indispensable for controlling
and exploiting the rich physics that they exhibit. Here we investigate the
effects of electron-phonon interactions on a QD-based cavity QED system. When
the QD and the cavity are off-resonance, we observe phonon-assisted cavity mode
emission that strongly depends on the temperature and cavity-detuning. When
they are on-resonance, we observe an asymmetric vacuum Rabi doublet, the
splitting of which narrows with increasing temperature. These experimental
observations can be well reproduced using a cavity QED model that includes
electron-acoustic-phonon interactions. Our work provides significant insight
into the important but hitherto poorly understood mechanism of non-resonant
QD-cavity coupling and into the physics of various cavity QED systems utilizing
emitters coupled to phonons, such as nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond and
colloidal nanocrystals.

power spectral densities (PSD's) but its origins remain controversial.
Zwanzig-Mori projection operators provide a rigorous, common starting place for
building a theory of PSD's from the bottom up. In this approach, one separates
out explicit ""system"" degrees of freedom (which are experimentally monitored)
from all other implicit or ""bath"" degrees of freedom, and then one ""projects""
or integrates out all the implicit degrees of freedom. The result is the
generalized Langevin equation. Within this formalism, the system PSD has a
simple relation to the bath PSD. We explore how several models of the bath PSD
affect the system PSD. We suggest that analyzing the baseline can yield
valuable information on the bath. The Debye model of acoustic bath oscillations
in particular gives rise to a low frequency 1/f divergence. Other power law
behaviors are possible with other models. None of these models require

We present a mid-infrared spectrum (5-38 microns) of 1999 JU3 obtained with
NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope in May 2008. These observations place new
constraints on the surface properties of this asteroid. To fit our spectrum we
used the near-Earth asteroid thermal model (NEATM) and the more complex
thermophysical model (TPM). However, the position of the spin-pole, which is
uncertain, is a crucial input parameter for constraining the thermal inertia
with the TPM; hence, we consider two pole orientations. In the extreme case of
an equatorial retrograde geometry we derive a lower limit to the thermal
inertia of 150 J/m^2/K/s^0.5. If we adopt the pole orientation of Abe et al.
(2008a) our best-fit thermal model yields a value for the thermal inertia of
700+/-200 J/m^2/K/s^0.5 and even higher values are allowed by the uncertainty
in the spectral shape due to the absolute flux calibration. The lower limit to
the thermal inertia, which is unlikely but possible, would be consistent with a
fine regolith similar to wthat is found for asteroid 433 Eros. However, the
thermal inertia is expected to be higher, possibly similar to or greater than
that on asteroid 25143 Itokawa. Accurately determining the spin-pole of

full infinite dimensional Galilean Conformal Algebra (GCA), such that it
reduces to the usual Navier-Stokes equation in an inertial frame. The
covariantization is possible only for incompressible flows, i.e when the
divergence of the velocity field vanishes. Using the continuity equation, we
can fix the transformation of pressure and density under GCA uniquely. We also
find that when all chemical potentials vanish, $c_{s}$, which denotes the speed
of sound in an inertial frame comoving with the flow, must either be a
fundamental constant or given in terms of microscopic parameters. We will
discuss how both could be possible. In absence of chemical potentials, we also
find that the covariance under GCA implies that either the viscosity should
vanish or the microscopic theory should have a length scale or a time scale or
both. We further find that the higher derivative corrections to the
Navier-Stokes equation, can be covariantized, only if they are restricted to
certain possible combinations in the inertial frame. We explicitly evaluate all
possible three derivative corrections. Finally, we argue that our analysis
hints that the parent relativistic theory with relativistic conformal symmetry
needs to be deformed before the contraction is taken to produce a sensible GCA
invariant dynamical limit.

torrent data in the official client was about to switch to uTP, an
application-layer congestion-control protocol using UDP at the transport-layer.
This announcement immediately raised an unmotivated buzz about a new, imminent
congestion collapse of the whole Internet. Though this reaction was not built
on solid technical foundation, nevertheless a legitimate question remains:
i.e., whether this novel algorithm is a necessary building block for future
Internet applications, or whether it may result in an umpteenth addition to the
already well populated world of Internet congestion control algorithms.
  In this paper, we tackle precisely this issue. The novel protocol is now
under discussion at the IETF LEDBAT working group, and has been defined in a
draft document in March 2009, whose adoption decision will be taken at the
beginning of August 2009. Adhering to the IETF draft definition, we implement
the LEDBAT congestion control algorithm and investigate its performance by
means of packet-level simulations. Considering a simple bottleneck scenario
where LEDBAT competes against either TCP or other LEDBAT flows, we evaluate the
fairness of the resource share as well as its efficiency. Our preliminary
results show that indeed, there is an undoubted appeal behind the novel
application-layer congestion-control protocol. Yet, care must be taken in order
to ensure that some important points, such as intra-protocol fairness, are
fully clarified in the draft specification -- which we hope that this work can
contribute to.

its morphological similarity to the radio emission from the galaxy suggest that
it arises from inverse Compton (IC) scattering, by relativistic electrons in
the radio jets, of Cosmic Microwave Background photons and potentially
far-infrared photons from the dusty starbursts around this galaxy. The X-ray
emission has a similar extent and morphology to the Ly-alpha halo around the
galaxy, suggesting that it may be ionising this halo. Indeed we find that the
GHz-radio and X-ray and Ly-alpha luminosities of the halo around 4C60.07 are

potential importance of IC emission in the formation of the most massive

theory, we find that the entanglement and squeezing of the output fields can be
achieved. By analyzing the squeezing spectrum, we show that asymmetric detuning
and asymmetric atomic initial state split the squeezing spectrum from one
valley into two minimum values, and appropriate leakage of the cavity is needed
for obtaining output entangled fields.

that RCP occurred in the atomic inversion can be measured via a homodyne

In the present work we use the Newman-Penrose formalism to characterize GWs in

both quadratic gravity and the f(R) theory belong to the most general invariant
class of GWs, i.e., they can present up to six independent polarizations of

gravity can present up to five polarizations states. On the other hand, if we
use the Palatini approach for f(R) theories, GWs present only the usual two
transverse-traceless polarizations such as in general relativity. Thus, we
conclude that the observation of GWs can strongly constrain the suitable

ubiquitous 1/f noise preserves the critical correlations. The emergent states
show intriguing interplay of intrinsic quantum critical and external noise

measured to 107.69^{+0.03}_{-0.06} GeV +- 1.1 \delta M_LSP and 183 ^{+11}_{-5}
GeV +- 18 \delta M_LSP, respectively, while the true values in SPS1a' are 107.9

production could be obtained with a precision of 3.1% and 4.2%, respectively.
Combining the mass and cross section measurement in the stau_2 channel allows
to determine the LSP mass with a relative error of 1.7%, assuming a known
mixing angle. In stau_1 -> tau LSP decays, the tau polarisation is measured to
be 91 +- 9% and 87.0 +- 3.4% in the pi and rho decay channels of the tau,
respectively. The true value in the simulated SPS1a' sample is 89.6%.

uncorrelated CTRW. For power-law correlations we find subdiffusion
characterized by the same exponent at all times, which appears to be smaller
than the one in uncorrelated CTRW. Interestingly, in the limiting case of an
extremely long power-law correlations, the (sub)diffusion exponent does not
tend to zero, but is bounded from below by the subdiffusion exponent

from the well-known results for the Bethe lattice. The consequences of the
logarithmic singularity in the DOS for the 2D lattice are more dramatic. At
half filling, the divergence pinned at the Fermi level is not washed out, only
its integrated weight decreases as the interaction is increased. While the Mott
transition is still of the usual kind, the magnetic-field-induced MIT falls
into a different universality class as there is no field-induced localization
of quasiparticles. In the case of a power-law singularity in the DOS at the
Fermi level, the power-law singularity persists in the presence of interaction,
albeit with a different exponent, and the effective impurity model in the DMFT

function which vanishes at the Fermi level. The system is then a generalized
Fermi liquid. At finite doping, regular Fermi liquid behavior is recovered.

fostered the interest in localization systems for wireless environments. The
majority of research in the context of wireless-based localization systems has
focused on device-based active localization, in which a device is attached to
tracked entities. Recently, device-free passive localization (DfP) has been
proposed where the tracked entity is neither required to carry devices nor
participate actively in the localization process. DfP systems are based on the
fact that RF signals are affected by the presence of people and objects in the
environment. The DfP concept enables a wide range of applications including
intrusion detection and tracking, border protection, and smart buildings
automation. Previous studies have focused on small areas with direct line of
sight and/or controlled environments. In this paper, we present the design,
implementation and analysis of Nuzzer, a large-scale device-free passive
localization system for real environments.
  Without any additional hardware, it makes use of the already installed
wireless data networks to monitor and process changes in the received signal
strength (RSS) transmitted from access points at one or more monitoring points.
We present probabilistic techniques for DfP localization and evaluate their
performance in a typical office building, rich in multipath, with an area of
1500 square meters. Our results show that the Nuzzer system gives device-free
location estimates with less than 2 meters median distance error using only two
monitoring laptops and three access points. This indicates the suitability of
Nuzzer to a large number of application domains.
