The gas particles are
adsorbed and the clusters become hosts. If the clusters are size selected, the
number of guests will be Poisson distributed. We review this by showcasing four
laboratory procedures that all rely on the validity of the Poisson model. The
effects of a statistical distribution of the cluster sizes in a beam of
clusters are discussed. We derive the average collision rates. Additionally, we
present Poisson mixture models that involve also standard deviations. We derive
the collision statistics for common size distributions of hosts and also for
some generalizations thereof. The models can be applied to large noble gas
clusters traversing doping gas. While outlining how to fit a generalized
Poisson to the statistics, we still find even these Poisson models to be often
insufficient.

device alternately sucks in and then expels a surrounding fluid, it moves in
the same direction as if it only expelled fluid. This surprising phenomenon,
which we call ""Machian propulsion,"" is explained by conservation of momentum:
the outflow efficiently transfers momentum away from the device and into the
surrounding medium, while the inflow can do so only by viscous diffusion.
However, many previous theoretical discussions have focused instead on the
difference in the shapes of the outflow and the inflow. Whereas the argument
based on conservation is straightforward and complete, the analysis of the
shapes of the flows is more subtle and requires conservation in the first
place. Our discussion covers three devices that have usually been treated
separately: the reverse sprinkler (also called the inverse, or Feynman
sprinkler), the putt-putt boat, and the aspirating cantilever. We then briefly
mention some applications of Machian propulsion, ranging from microengineering
to astrophysics.

our ultra-deep Subaru/Suprime-Cam z'- and y-band (lambda_eff=1um) images with
legacy data of Subaru and HST, we have identified 22 bright z-dropout galaxies
down to y=26, one of which has a spectroscopic redshift of z=6.96 determined
from Lya emission. The z=7 luminosity function (LF) yields the best-fit
Schechter parameters of phi*=0.69 +2.62/-0.55 x10^(-3) Mpc^(-3), Muv*=-20.10
+/-0.76 mag, and alpha=-1.72 +/-0.65, and indicates a decrease from z=6 at a
>95% confidence level. This decrease is beyond the cosmic variance in our two
fields, which is estimated to be a factor of <~2. We have found that the cosmic
star formation rate density drops from the peak at z=2-3 to z=7 roughly by a
factor of ~10 but not larger than ~100. A comparison with the reionization
models suggests either that the Universe could not be totally ionized by only
galaxies at z=7, or more likely that properties of galaxies at z=7 are
different from those at low redshifts having, e.g., a larger escape fraction
(>~0.2), and/or a flatter IMF. Our SDF z-dropout galaxies appear to form 60-Mpc
long filamentary structures, and the z=6.96 galaxy with Lya emission is located
at the center of an overdense region consisting of four UV bright dropout
candidates, which might suggest an existence of a well-developed ionized bubble
at z=7.

the subthreshold regime, the frequency dependence of the extracellular medium
and that of the membrane potential have a clear incidence on F_T. The
calculation of F_T from experiments and the matching with theoretical
expressions is possible for desynchronized states where individual current
sources can be considered as independent. Using a mean-field approximation, we
obtain a method to estimate the impedance of the extracellular medium without
injecting currents. We examine the transfer function for bipolar (differential)
LFPs and compare to simultaneous recordings of V_m and V_{LFP} during
desynchronized states in rat barrel cortex in vivo. The experimentally derived
F_T matches the one derived theoretically, only if one assumes that the
impedance of the extracellular medium is frequency-dependent, and varies as
1/sqrt(omega) (Warburg impedance) for frequencies between 3 and 500 Hz. This
constitutes indirect evidence that the extracellular medium is non-resistive,
which has many possible consequences for modeling LFPs.

another (average delay). We do not assume the arrival and channel statistics to
be known. To handle state space explosion and informational constraints, we
split the problem into individual CMDPs for the users, coupled through their
Lagrange multipliers; and a user selection problem at the base station. To
address the issue of unknown channel and arrival statistics, we propose a
reinforcement learning algorithm. The users use this learning algorithm to
determine the rate at which they wish to transmit in a slot and communicate
this to the base station. The base station then schedules the user with the
highest rate in a slot. We analyze convergence, stability and optimality

Here we discuss Brans-Dicke theory and massive graviton theories as typical

star (NS) and an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) for Brans-Dicke (BD)
theory and those composed of a super massive black hole (SMBH) and a black hole
(SMBH) for massive graviton theories. Using the restricted 2PN waveforms
including spin effects and taking the spin precession into account, we perform
the Monte Carlo simulations of $10^4$ binaries to estimate the determination
accuracy of binary parameters including the Brans-Dicke parameter
$\omega_{\mathrm{BD}}$ and the graviton Compton length $\lambda_g$. Assuming a
$(1.4, 10)M_{\odot}$ NS/BH binary of SNR=$\sqrt{200}$, the constraint on
$\omega_{\mathrm{BD}}$ is obtained as $\omega_{\mathrm{BD}}>2.32\times 10^6$,
which is 300 times stronger than the estimated constraint from LISA
observation. Furthermore, we find that, due to the expected large merger rate
of NS/BH binaries of $O(10^4)$ yr$^{-1}$, a statistical analysis yields
$\omega_{\mathrm{BD}}>3.77\times10^8$, which is 4 orders of magnitude stronger
than the current strongest bound obtained from the solar system experiment. For
massive graviton theories, assuming a $(10^6, 10^5)M_{\odot}$ BH/BH binary at
3Gpc, one can put a constraint $\lambda_g>3.35\times10^{20}$cm, on average.
This is three orders of magnitude stronger than the one obtained from the solar
system experiment. From these results, it is understood that DECIGO/BBO is a
very powerful tool for constraining alternative theories of gravity, too.

calculations in toric geometry, which seek to express arithmetic, elliptic, and
associated genera of toric varieties in terms only of their fans. Our theory
focuses on the universal toric genus \Phi, which was introduced independently
by Krichever and Loeffler in 1974, albeit from radically different viewpoints.
In fact \Phi is a version of tom Dieck's bundling transformation of 1970,
defined on T^k-equivariant complex cobordism classes and taking values in the
complex cobordism algebra of the classifying space. We proceed by combining the
analytic, the formal group theoretic, and the homotopical approaches to genera,
and refer to the index theoretic approach as a recurring source of insight and
motivation. The resultant flexibility allows us to identify several distinct
genera within our framework, and to introduce parametrised versions that apply
to bundles equipped with a stably complex structure on the tangents along their
fibres. In the presence of isolated fixed points, we obtain universal
localisation formulae, whose applications include the identification of
Krichever's generalised elliptic genus as universal amongst genera that are
rigid on SU-manifolds. We follow the traditions of toric geometry by working
with a variety of illustrative examples wherever possible. For background and
prerequisites we attempt to reconcile the literature of east and west, which
developed independently for several decades after the 1960s.

emission from a cluster of galaxies at a detectable level with the current
generation of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. The gamma-ray emission
was produced via inverse Compton upscattering of cosmic microwave background
(CMB) photons by electron-positron pairs generated by collisions of UHE cosmic
rays in the cluster. We observed two clusters of galaxies, Abell 3667 and Abell
4038, searching for very-high-energy gamma-ray emission with the CANGAROO-III
atmospheric Cherenkov telescope system in 2006. The analysis showed no
significant excess around these clusters, yielding upper limits on the
gamma-ray emission. From a comparison of the upper limit for the north-west
radio relic region of Abell 3667 with a model prediction, we derive a lower
limit for the magnetic field of the region of ~0.1 micro G. This shows the
potential of gamma-ray observations in studies of the cluster environment. We

orbit if and only if the pushing process in the direction of that simple root
increases as the sum of all the Brownian local times in the directions of the
orbit's positive elements. The last one shows that the pushing process may be
written as the sum of an inward normal vector at the chamber's boundary and an
inward normal vector at the origin, yielding a kind of a multivoque stochastic
differential equation for the reflected process. We finally give a particles
system interpretation of the reflected process and construct a multidimensional
skew Brownian motion.

(G-ESS) solutions of Einstein field equations minimally coupled to generalized
non-linear abelian gauge models in three space dimensions. These models are
defined by lagrangian densities which are general functions of the gauge field
invariants, restricted by some physical conditions of admissibility. They
include the class of non-linear electrodynamics supporting ESS non-topological
soliton solutions in absence of gravity. We establish that the qualitative
structure of the G-ESS solutions of admissible models is fully characterized by
the asymptotic and central-field behaviours of their ESS solutions in flat
space (or, equivalently, by the behaviour of the lagrangian densities in vacuum
and on the point of the boundary of their domain of definition, where the
second gauge invariant vanishes). The structure of these G-ESS configurations
for admissible models supporting divergent-energy ESS solutions in flat space
is qualitatively the same as in the Reissner-Nordstr\""om case. In contrast, the
G-ESS configurations of the models supporting finite-energy ESS solutions in
flat space exhibit new qualitative features, which are discussed in terms of
the ADM mass, the charge and the soliton energy. Most of the results concerning
well known models, such as the electrodynamics of Maxwell, Born-Infeld and the
Euler-Heisenberg effective lagrangian of QED, minimally coupled to gravitation,
are shown to be corollaries of general statements of this analysis.

the top-gate graphene transistors. The back-gate graphene devices were modified
via addition of the top gate separated by 20 nm of HfO2 from the single-layer
graphene channels. The measurements revealed low flicker noise levels with the
normalized noise spectral density close to 1/f (f is the frequency) and Hooge
parameter below 2 x 10^-3. The analysis of the noise spectral density
dependence on the top and bottom gate biases helped us to elucidate the noise
sources in these devices and develop a strategy for the electronic noise
reduction. The obtained results are important for all proposed graphene
applications in electronics and sensors.

the application of appropriately tuned global laser fields, the reflection
operator needed for the quantum search algorithm can be realized in a single
physical operation. Thus, the time steps in which Grover's search can be
implemented become equal to the mathematical steps ~ O(\sqrt{N}), where N is
the size of the register. We study the robustness of the implementation against
errors due to photon losses and fluctuations in the cavity frequencies and
