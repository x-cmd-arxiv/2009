version of the Wilson-Devinney program (W-D) that makes use of the direct
distance estimation (DDE) algorithm. The reported distance of d = 123.6pc is an
average based on solutions for B and V data and a primary star temperature of
5800K. Standardized light curves (not differential), radial velocities, and a
spectroscopic primary star temperature are input to the pro- gram. Differential
corrections were performed for each light curve band along with the velocities
for two primary temperatures that span 100K. Log10d is a model parameter like
many others that are adjustable in W-D. The eclipsing binary distance agrees
with the Hipparcos parallax distance and is more precise.

a linear decomposition of generic conformal blocks works very well not only in
the case of Virasoro symmetry, but also for conformal theories with extended
chiral algebra. This is rather natural, because Nekrasov functions are
introduced as expansion basis for generalized hypergeometric integrals, very
similar to those which arise in expansion of Dotsenko-Fateev integrals in
powers of alpha-parameters. Thus, the AGT conjecture is closely related to the
old belief that conformal theory can be effectively described in the free field
formalism, and it can actually be a key to clear formulating and proof this
long-standing hypothesis. As an application of this kind of reasoning we use
knowledge of the exact hypergeometric conformal block for complete proof of the
AGT relation for a restricted class of external states.

cyclobis(paraquat-\emph{p}-phenylene) rings threaded onto an oligomer of
1,5-dioxynaphthalenes linked by polyethers. The simulations are performed in a
high dielectric medium using MM3 as the force field. The resulting force vs.
extension isotherms show a mechanically unstable region in which the molecule
unfolds and, for selected extensions, blinks in the force measurements between
a high-force and a low-force regime. From the force vs. extension data the
molecular potential of mean force is reconstructed using the weighted histogram
analysis method and decomposed into energetic and entropic contributions. The
simulations indicate that the folding of the oligorotaxanes is energetically
favored but entropically penalized, with the energetic contributions overcoming
the entropy penalty and effectively driving the self-assembly. In addition, an
analogy between the single-molecule folding/unfolding events driven by the AFM
tip and the thermodynamic theory of first-order phase transitions is discussed
and general conditions, on the molecule and the cantilever, for the emergence

amplitudes that are analytic in energy. Analyticity enables Dispersion
Relations (DR's) for such amplitudes, relating real and imaginary parts. Lately
it has been suggested that DR's be applied to the integrated Generalized Parton
Distributions that embody the spin-dependent soft, but factorizable part of the
scattering. However, at non-zero momentum transfer, DRs require integration
over unphysical regions of the variables. We show that the relevant unphysical

of an unstable state in the long time region is considered. In 1957 Khalfin
proved that this amplitude tends to zero as $t\to\infty$ more slowly than any
exponential function of $t$. For a time-dependent decay rate $\gamma(t)$
Khalfin's result means that this $\gamma(t)$ is not a constant for large $t$
but that it tends to zero as $t\to\infty$. We find that a similar conclusion
can be drawn for the instantaneous energy of the unstable state for a large
class of models of unstable states: This energy tends to the minimal energy of
the system ${\cal E}_{min}$ as $t\to\infty$ which is much smaller than the
energy of this state for $t$ of the order of the lifetime of the considered
state. Analyzing the transition time region between exponential and
non-exponential form of the survival amplitude we find that the instantaneous
energy of a considered unstable state can take large values, much larger than
the energy of this state for $t$ from the exponential time region. Taking into
account results obtained for a model considered, it is hypothesized that this
purely quantum mechanical effect may be responsible for the properties of broad
resonances such as $\sigma$ meson as well as having astrophysical and
cosmological consequences.

the grid framework ProActive. The analysis of our parallel simulator, based on

successfully reduce the number of rolled back transaction moves but it also
reveals circumstances in which the SRTW algorithm can be outperformed by the

via the exponent of the interactions. Monte Carlo simulations of the spin-glass
susceptibility and the two-point finite-size correlation length show that deep
in the non-mean-field regime the finite-temperature transition is lost, whereas
this is not the case in the mean-field regime, in agreement with the prediction
of Moore and Drossel [Phys. Rev. Lett. 89, 217202 (2002)] that 3-spin models
are in the same universality class as an Ising spin glass in a magnetic field.
However, slightly in the non-mean-field region, we find an apparent transition
in the 3-spin model, in contrast to results for the Ising spin glass in a

asymptotic behavior in this region.

is the minimum number k such that there is an acyclic edge coloring using k
colors and is denoted by $a'(G)$. It was conjectured by Alon, Sudakov and Zaks
(and much earlier by Fiamcik) that $a'(G)\le \Delta+2$, where $\Delta
=\Delta(G)$ denotes the maximum degree of the graph. We prove that if $G$ is a
planar graph with maximum degree $\Delta$, then $a'(G)\le \Delta + 12$.

distribution of earthquake seismic moments introduced by Pisarenko et al.
[2009] and apply it to the earthquake catalog of Japan (1923-2007). The method
is based on the two main limit theorems of the theory of extreme values and on
the derived duality between the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) and
Generalized Extreme Value distribution (GEV). We obtain the distribution of
maximum earthquake magnitudes in future time intervals of arbitrary duration
tau. This distribution can be characterized by its quantile Qq(tau) at any
desirable statistical level q. The quantile Qq(tau) provides a much more stable
and robust characteristic than the traditional absolute maximum magnitude Mmax
(Mmax can be obtained as the limit of Qq(tau) as q tends to 1, and tau tends to
infinity). The best estimates of the parameters governing the distribution of
Qq(tay) for Japan (1923-2007) are the following: Form parameter for GEV =
-0.1901 +- 0.0717; position parameter GEV(tau=200)= 6.3387 +- 0.0380; spread
parameter for GEV(tau=200)= 0.5995 +- 0.0223; Q_0.90,GEV(tau=10)= 8.34 +- 0.32.
We also estimate Qq(tau) for a set of q-values and future time periods in the
range for tau between 1 and 50 years from 2007. For comparison, the absolute
maximum estimate Mmax from GEV, which is equal to 9.57 +- 0.86, has a scatter
more than twice that of the 90 percent quantile Q_{0.90,GEV}(tau=10) of the
maximum magnitude over the next 10 years counted from 2007.

in shaping the dynamics of complex systems, this intricate relationship still

we can map the network topology directly to the dynamical patterns emergent on
it -- independent of the nature of the dynamical process. We find that many
seemingly diverse dynamical processes such as coupled oscillators and diffusion
phenomena can all be understood and unified through this same procedure. Using
the multiscale complexity measure derived form the structure-dynamics
transformation, we find that the topological features like hierarchy,
heterogeneity and modularity all result in higher complexity. This result
suggests a universal principle: it is the desire for functional diversity that
drives the evolution of network architecture.

Symmetry Approach to obtain general exact solutions for the cosmological

theoretical model and observations is worked out. In particular, we use type Ia
supernovae and large scale structure parameters determined from the 2-degree
Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS)and from the Wide part of the VIMOS-VLT
Deep Survey (VVDS). It turns out that the model is compatible with the

include radiation. We show that it is compatible with data derived from
recombination and it seems that quintessence do not affect nucleosynthesis
