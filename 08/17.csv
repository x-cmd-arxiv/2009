equations are both widely used to describe the dynamics of open quantum
systems. The connection between these two descriptions is a classic topic in
mathematical physics. One direction was solved by the now famous result due to
Lindblad, Kossakowski Gorini and Sudarshan, who gave a complete
characterisation of the master equations that generate completely positive
semi-groups. However, the other direction has remained open: given a CPT map,
is there a Lindblad master equation that generates it (and if so, can we find
it's form)? This is sometimes known as the Markovianity problem. Physically, it
is asking how one can deduce underlying physical processes from experimental
observations.
  We give a complexity theoretic answer to this problem: it is NP-hard. We also
give an explicit algorithm that reduces the problem to integer semi-definite
programming, a well-known NP problem. Together, these results imply that
resolving the question of which CPT maps can be generated by master equations
is tantamount to solving P=NP: any efficiently computable criterion for
Markovianity would imply P=NP; whereas a proof that P=NP would imply that our
algorithm already gives an efficiently computable criterion. Thus, unless P
does equal NP, there cannot exist any simple criterion for determining when a
CPT map has a master equation description.
  However, we also show that if the system dimension is fixed (relevant for
current quantum process tomography experiments), then our algorithm scales
efficiently in the required precision, allowing an underlying Lindblad master
equation to be determined efficiently from even a single snapshot in this case.
  Our work also leads to similar complexity-theoretic answers to a related
long-standing open problem in probability theory.

to correlate over several orders of magnitude. This correlation however shows a
large scatter: black hole candidates with very similar X-ray luminosity,
spectral energy distribution and variability, show rather different radio
luminosities. This challenges theoretical models that aim at describing both
the radio and the X-ray fluxes in terms of radiative emission from a
relativistic jet. More generally, it opens important questions on how similar
accretion flows can produce substantially different outflows. Here we present a
possible explanation for this phenomenon, based on the strong dependency of the
jet spectral energy distribution on the magnetic field strength, and on the
idea that the strength of the jet magnetic field varies from source to source.
Because of the effect of radiative losses, sources with stronger jet magnetic
field values would have lower radio emission. We discuss the implications of
this scenario, the main one being that the radio flux does not necessarily
provide a direct measure of the jet power. We further discuss how a variable
jet magnetic field, reaching a critical value, can qualitatively explain the
observed spectral transition out of the hard state.

variety of late-type stars through their solar-like oscillations. We report
observations of the star HD175726 that lasted for 27 days during the first
short run of the mission. The time series reveals a high-activity signal and
the power spectrum presents an excess due to solar-like oscillations with a low
signal-to-noise ratio. Aims. Our aim is to identify the most efficient tools to
extract as much information as possible from the power density spectrum.
Methods. The most productive method appears to be the autocorrelation of the
time series, calculated as the spectrum of the filtered spectrum. This method
is efficient, very rapid computationally, and will be useful for the analysis
of other targets, observed with CoRoT or with forthcoming missions such as
Kepler and Plato. Results. The mean large separation has been measured to be
97.2+-0.5 microHz, slightly below the expected value determined from solar
scaling laws.We also show strong evidence for variation of the large separation
with frequency. The bolometric mode amplitude is only 1.7+-0.25 ppm for radial
modes, which is 1.7 times less than expected. Due to the low signal-to-noise
ratio, mode identification is not possible for the available data set of
HD175726. Conclusions. This study shows the possibility of extracting a seismic
signal despite a signal-to-noise ratio of only 0.37. The observation of such a
target shows the efficiency of the CoRoT data, and the potential benefit of
longer observing runs.

many-body Kondo physics with entangled spin and orbital degrees of freedom. The
approach captures many-body broadening of the Hubbard satellites, recovers the
correct exponential vanishing of the Kondo scale for all N, and its universal
scaling spectra are found to be in very good agreement with numerical
renormalization group (NRG) results. In particular the high-frequency
logarithmic decays of the scaling spectra, obtained here in closed form for
arbitrary N, coincide essentially perfectly with available numerics from the
NRG. A particular case of an anisotropic Coulomb interaction, in which the

the diffusion approximation of Stamatellos et al., (ii) the barotropic equation
of state (EOS) of Goodwin et al., and (iii) the barotropic EOS of Bate et al.
The barotropic approximations capture the general evolution of the density and
temperature at the centre of each proto-fragment but (i) they do not make any
adjustments the particular circumstances of a proto-fragment forming in the
disc, and (ii) they do not take into account thermal inertia effects that are
important for fast-forming proto-fragments in the outer disc region. As a
result, the number of fragments formed in the disc and their properties are
different, when a barotropic EOS is used. This is important not only for disc
studies but also for simulations of collapsing turbulent clouds, as in many
cases in such simulations stars form with discs that subsequently fragment. We
also examine the difference in the way proto-fragments condense out in the disc
at different distances from the central star using the diffusion approximation
and following the collapse of each proto-fragment until the formation of the
second core (~10^{-3} g/cm3). We find that proto-fragments forming closer to
the central star tend to form earlier and evolve faster from the first to the
second core than proto-fragments forming in the outer disc region. The former
have a large pool of material in the inner disc region that they can accrete
from and grow in mass. The latter accrete more slowly and they are hotter
because they generally form in a quick abrupt event.

temperature decrease, but the transition remains sharp at modest doping while

framework of relativistic mean-field hadron models (NL3, NL$\rho$ and
NL$\rho\delta$) with the inclusion of the electromagnetic field. The
distillation effect and the spinodals for all the models considered are
discussed. The crust-core transition density and pressure are obtained as a
function of temperature for $\beta$-equilibrium matter with and without
neutrino trapping. An estimation of the size of the clusters formed in the
non-homogeneous phase is made. It is shown that cluster sizes increase with
temperature. The effects of the $\delta$-meson on the instability region are
larger for low temperatures, very asymmetric matter and densities close to the
spinodal surface. It increases the distillation effect above $\sim 0.4\rho_0$
and has the opposite effect below that density.

thermodynamics. Spontaneous reductions in $\phi_{st}$ arise from increases in
the ``flux entropy'' of the system - a measure of the variability of the fluxes

of the flux entropy, the formulation reduces to the MEP principle. The inferred
steady state is also shown to exhibit high variability in its instantaneous
fluxes and rates, consistent with the observed behaviour of turbulent fluid

coexistence of energy producers and consumers in ecological systems. The
different paths for attaining steady state are also classified.

backgrounds. At sufficiently high Hawking temperature T_H, one expects a phase
where the black hole is in equilibrium with a deconfined plasma. We explore
this phase in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, and argue that two
possible behaviors may result. At a given Hawking temperature T_H, field
theories on large black hole backgrounds will couple strongly to the plasma and
will be dual to novel bulk spacetimes having a single connected horizon which
we dub {\it black funnels}. We construct examples of black funnels in low
spacetime dimensions for different classes of field theory black holes. In this
case, perturbing the equilibrium state results in the field theory exchanging
heat with the black hole at a rate typical of conduction through deconfined
plasma. In contrast, we argue that due to the finite physical size of plasma
excitations, smaller black holes will couple only weakly to the field theory
excitations. This situation is dual to bulk solutions containing two
disconnected horizons which remain to be constructed. Here perturbations lead
to heat exchange at a level typical of confined phases, even when T_H remains
far above any deconfinement transition. At least at large N and strong
coupling, these two behaviors are separated by a sharp transition. Our results
also suggest a richer class of brane-world black holes than hitherto
anticipated.

species suggest that HCRs are most likely moderately dense with n ~ 10^{3}

phase in low metallicity environments. We suggest that HCRs may be tracing
clouds at the transition from atomic to molecule-dominated medium, and could be
a powerful way to study early stages of gas condensation in low metallicity
galaxies. Alternatively, if made up of dense molecular clumps < 0.5 pc in size,

taking into account the overhead due to channel estimation and limited feedback
of channel state information. Multi-input single-output (MISO) and multi-input

Each coherence block contains $L$ symbols, and is spanned by $T$ training
symbols, $B$ feedback bits, and the data symbols. The training symbols are used
to obtain a Minimum Mean Squared Error estimate of the channel matrix. Given
this estimate, the receiver selects a transmit beamforming vector from a
codebook containing $2^B$ {\em i.i.d.} random vectors, and sends the
corresponding $B$ bits back to the transmitter. We derive bounds on the
beamforming capacity for MISO and MIMO channels and characterize the optimal
(rate-maximizing) training and feedback overhead ($T$ and $B$) as $L$ and the
number of transmit antennas $N_t$ both become large. The optimal $N_t$ is
limited by the coherence time, and increases as $L/\log L$. For the MISO
channel the optimal $T/L$ and $B/L$ (fractional overhead due to training and
feedback) are asymptotically the same, and tend to zero at the rate $1/\log

faster (as $1/\log^2 N_t$).

that active sources can create a nearly ""silent"" domain which can conceal any

extension of the Zelterman estimator by means of logistic regression to include
observed heterogeneity in the form of covariates. We also review an estimator

308 ULIRGs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 6, and classified
them into the NL ULIRGs (with only narrow emission lines) and the Type I ULIRGs
(with broad emission lines). About 56% of ULIRGs in our total sample show
interaction features, and this percentage is 79% for redshift z < 0.2. Optical
identifications of these ULIRGs show that the AGN percentage is at least 49%,
and the percentage increases with the infrared luminosity. We found 62 Type I
ULIRGs, and estimated their BH masses and velocity dispersions from their
optical spectra. Together with known Type I ULIRGs in the literature, a sample
of 90 Type I ULIRGs enables us to make a statistical study. We found that the
BH masses of Type I ULIRGs are typically smaller than those of PG QSOs, and
most Type I ULIRGs follow the M_{BH}-sigma relation. However, some ULIRGs with
larger Eddington ratio deviate from this relation, even the line width of the
[OIII] narrow line (NL) core or the [SII] line was used as the surrogate of
velocity dispersion. This implies that at least some ULIRGs are probably still
in the early evolution stage toward QSOs. The anti-correlation between the mass
deviation from the M_{BH}-sigma relation and the Eddington ratio supports that
the evolution of Type I ULIRGs is probably followed by the building up of the
M_{BH}-sigma relation and the evolution to the QSO phase.

heat behavior, corresponding to a negative exponent $\alpha$, and belongs to a
new distinctive universality class with $\nu=1.135(11)$, $\gamma/\nu=1.744(9)$,

an EM algorithm implemented by means of certain recursions taken from the
literature on hidden Markov chains. Of particular interest is the estimation of
the effect of each nursing home on the probability of transition between the
latent states. We show how the estimates of these effects may be used to
construct a set of scores which allows us to rank these facilities in terms of
their efficacy in taking care of the health conditions of their patients. The

homes located in the Region of Umbria, Italy, which were followed for the

three point function is proportional to the slow roll parameters and there is
an amplification in $f_{NL}$ by a factor of 65 to 90 due to the contribution of

on the other hand appears in this case due to the thermal averaging and the
fact that thermal averaging of four-point correlation is not the same as the
square of the thermal averaging of the two-point function. Due to this fact
$\tau_{NL}$ is not proportional to the slow-roll parameters and can be as large

the targets have robust detections, S/N > 4, while a further three targets are
marginally detected with S/N > =2.5. All sources are detected in multiple
mid-infrared bands with the Spitzer Space Telescope. The multiwavelength
spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the type-2 QSOs are compared to those
of two local ultraluminous galaxies (Arp220 and IR22491) in order to assess
contributions from a star-forming component in various parts of the SED. We
suggest that their submillimetre emission is possibly due to a starburst while
a large fraction of the mid-infrared energy is likely to originate in the
obscured central quasar. Using the mid-infrared and submm observations we
derive infrared luminosities which are found to be in excess of L>10^12Lsun.
The submillimetre (850micron) to X-ray (2 keV) spectral indices (alpha_SX) span
a wide range. About half of the type-2 QSOs have values typical for a
Compton-thick AGN with only 1 per cent of the nuclear emission seen through
scattering and, the remaining with values typical of submm-bright galaxies.
Combining the available observational evidence we outline a possible scenario

patient sickness at admission involves a logistic regression of mortality
within 30 days of admission on a fairly large number of sickness indicators (on
the order of 100) to construct a sickness scale, employing classical variable
selection methods to find an ``optimal'' subset of 10--20 indicators. Such
``benefit-only'' methods ignore the considerable differences among the sickness
indicators in cost of data collection, an issue that is crucial when admission
sickness is used to drive programs (now implemented or under consideration in
several countries, including the U.S. and U.K.) that attempt to identify
substandard hospitals by comparing observed and expected mortality rates (given
admission sickness). When both data-collection cost and accuracy of prediction
of 30-day mortality are considered, a large variable-selection problem arises
in which costly variables that do not predict well enough should be omitted
from the final scale. In this paper (a) we develop a method for solving this
problem based on posterior model odds, arising from a prior distribution that
(1) accounts for the cost of each variable and (2) results in a set of
posterior model probabilities that corresponds to a generalized cost-adjusted
version of the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and (b) we compare this
method with a decision-theoretic cost-benefit approach based on maximizing
expected utility. We use reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC)
methods to search the model space, and we check the stability of our findings
with two variants of the MCMC model composition ($\mathit{MC}^3$) algorithm.

indicate long-range spacetime correlations or non-local connections and is a
signature of selforganised criticality generic to dynamical systems in nature

has developed a general systems theory which predicts the observed
selforganised criticality as a signature of quantumlike chaos in dynamical
systems. The model predictions are (i) The fractal fluctuations can be resolved
into an overall logarithmic spiral trajectory with the quasiperiodic Penrose
tiling pattern for the internal structure. (ii) The probability distribution
represents the power (variance) spectrum for fractal fluctuations and follows
universal inverse power law form incorporating the golden mean. Such a result
that the additive amplitudes of eddies when squared represent probability
distribution is observed in the subatomic dynamics of quantum systems such as
the electron or photon. Therefore the irregular or unpredictable fractal
fluctuations exhibit quantumlike chaos. (iii) Atmospheric aerosols are held in
suspension by the vertical velocity distribution (spectrum). The atmospheric
aerosol size spectrum is derived in terms of the universal inverse power law
characterizing atmospheric eddy energy spectrum. Model predicted spectrum is in

measuring the distance sequences between the trajectory and the basin boundary.
The dynamical formation of stable chaos originates from the intersection points

on the stein's equations of gravitational fields. However, British physicist E.
A. Milne pointed in 1943 that the same equation could be deduced simply based
on the Newtonian theory of gravity. It means that the Friedmann equation, in
stead of the motion equation of relativity, is actually the Newtonian one in
essence. The reason is that two simplified conditions are used in the deduction
of the Friedmann equation. One is the Robertson-Walker metric and another is
static energy momentum tensor. It is proved that in light of the R-W metric,
the velocity of light emitted by celestial bodies in the expansive universe
would satisfy the Galileo's addition rule. So what the R-W metric describes is
unsuitable to be taken as the space-time structure of relativity cosmology. On
the other hand, because there are relative velocities between observer and
material in the expensive universe actually, we should consider dynamic energy
momentum tensor in cosmology. The Friedmann equations need relativity revision.
In this way, some deductions of current cosmology, such as the values of Hubble
constant, dark material and dark energy densities and so on, should be
re-estimated. The possible form of relativity metric for cosmology is proposed
at last. It is proved strictly based on the Einstein's equation of gravity that
the space-time of the expansive universe can not be flat. In this way, by
establishing cosmology on the really rational foundation of relativity, we may
get rid of the current puzzle situation of cosmology thoroughly.

the source of the field is the polarization current density induced inside the

equivalence of all these radiation processes. Exact solution for one of the
basic radiation problems is found with this method: emission of a particle
passing through a cylindrical channel in a screen of arbitrary width and
permittivity $\epsilon (\omega) = \epsilon^{\prime} + i \epsilon^{\prime

describes different types of polarization radiation: DR, TR and CR. The
particular case of radiation produced by the particle crossing axially the
sharp boundary between vacuum and a plasma cylinder of finite radius is also
considered. The problem of SPR generated when the particle moves nearby a set

Although the observations of radio emission up to 212 GHz indicates that
relativistic electrons with energies of a few MeV were accelerated, no
significant hard X-ray emission was detected by RHESSI above ~ 250 keV. Images
at 12--20 and 50--100 keV reveal a very compact, but resolved, source of about
~ 10"" x 10"". EUV TRACE images show a multi-kernel structure suggesting a
complex (multipolar) magnetic topology. During the peak time the radio spectrum
shows an extended flatness from ~ 7 to 35 GHz. Modeling the optically thin part
of the radio spectrum as gyrosynchrotron emission we obtained the electron
spectrum (spectral index delta, instantaneous number of emitting electrons). It
is shown that in order to keep the expected X-ray emission from the same
emitting electrons below the RHESSI background at 250 keV, a magnetic field
above 500 G is necessary. On the other hand, the electron spectrum deduced from
radio observations >= 50 GHz is harder than that deduced from ~ 70 - 250 keV
X-ray data, meaning that there must exist a breaking energy around a few
hundred keV. During the decay of the impulsive phase, a hardening of the X-ray
spectrum is observed which is interpreted as a hardening of the electron
distribution spectrum produced by the diffusion due to Coulomb collisions of
the trapped electrons in a medium with an electron density of n_e ~ 3E10 - 5E10

Both approaches reproduce the limiting cases of nuclear statistical equilibrium

physics and quantum information (measurement-based quantum computation). Many
publications have been devoted to the subject. Recently entanglement was
studied in the VBS state. In this review we start with the definition of a
general AKLT spin chain and the construction of VBS ground state. In order to
study entanglement, a block subsystem is introduced and described by the
density matrix. Density matrices of 1-dimensional models are diagonalized and
the entanglement entropies (the von Neumann entropy and Renyi entropy) are
calculated. In the large block limit, the entropies also approach finite
limits. Study of the spectrum of the density matrix led to the discovery that
the density matrix is proportional to a projector.

radiate with a perfect blackbody spectrum. This is a new result. Within the
semiclassical (WKB) approximation the temperature of the spectrum is given by
the semiclassical Hawking temperature. Beyond the semiclassical approximation
the thermal nature of the spectrum does not change but the temperature
undergoes some higher order corrections. This is true for both black hole
(event) and cosmological horizons. Using the first law of thermodynamics the
black hole entropy is calculated. Specifically the $D$-dimensional static,
chargeless black hole solutions which are spherically symmetric and
asymptotically flat, AdS or dS are considered. The interesting property of
these black holes is that their semiclassical entropy does not obey the
Bekenstein-Hawking area law. It is found that the leading correction to the
semiclassical entropy for these black holes is not logarithmic and next to
leading correction is also not inverse of horizon area. This is in contrast to
the black holes in Einstein gravity. The modified result is due to the presence
of Gauss-Bonnet term in the Lovelock Lagrangian. For the limit where the
coupling constant of the Gauss-Bonnet term vanishes one recovers the known
correctional terms as expected in Einstein gravity. Finally we relate the
coefficient of the leading (non-logarithmic) correction with the trace anomaly
of the stress tensor.

sufficiently different to resist conventional analysis of convergence. We thus
provide limited results which identify the potential limiting points of the

a signature for the production of the quark gluon plasma (QGP). In order to
search for this effect in heavy ion collisions one must have a clear
understanding of all the factors that can contribute to such a suppression.
These may include shadowing of the partons in a nuclear environment, breakup of
a correlated $c-\bar{c}$ pair as it traverses the nuclear fragment, suppression
of feed-down from higher mass states as well as other initial state
interactions. In order to disentangle these effects one must measure charmonium
production rates in both proton+proton (p+p) and proton+nucleus (p+A)
collisions. The p+p collisions serve as a baseline for searching for
suppression compared to binary scaling predictions, allow one to quantify the
amount of feed-down from higher states as well as serve as a tool to
distinguish between different theoretical calculations for charmonium
production mechanisms. In order to quantify nuclear effects it is also
necessary to study charmonium production in p+A collisions where the
temperature and density of the system are low compared to a heavy ion
collision. These measurements allow one to determine the influence of nuclear
shadowing and breakup in ""cold"" nuclear matter which can be extrapolated to
heavy ion collisions in order to determine the amount anomalous suppression. Of
course, extrapolations that rely on a model based technique depend heavily on
the assumption of a production mechanism, a fact that reinforces the importance
of the p+p measurements...

based on the 3D height of plumes and the electron density derived from
SUMER/\emph{SOHO} Si {\sc viii} line pair, we found that electron densities
along the plumes decrease with height above the solar surface. The temperature
obtained from the density scale height is 1.6 to 1.8 times larger than the
temperature obtained from Mg {\sc ix} line ratios. We attribute this
discrepancy to a deviation of the electron and the ion temperatures. Finally,
we have found that the outflow speeds studied in the O {\sc vi} line in the
plumes corrected by the angle between the line of sight and the plume
orientation are quite small with a maximum of 10 $\mathrm{km s^{-1}}$. It is
unlikely that plumes are a dominant contributor to the fast solar wind.

combination of viscous accretion and photoevaporation driven by stellar
high-energy photons. Observational evidence for magnetospheric accretion in
young sun-like stars is robust. Here we report the first observational evidence
for disk photoevaporation driven by the central star. We acquired
high-resolution (R~30,000) spectra of the [NeII] 12.81 micron line from 7
circumstellar disks using VISIR on Melipal/VLT. We show that the 3 transition
disks in the sample all have [NeII] line profiles consistent with those
predicted by a photoevaporative flow driven by stellar extreme UV photons. The
~6 km/s blue-shift of the line from the almost face-on disk of TW Hya is
clearly inconsistent with emission from a static disk atmosphere and
convincingly points to the presence of a photoevaporative wind. We do not
detect any [NeII] line close to the stellar velocity from the sample of
classical optically thick (non-transition) disks. We conclude that most of the
spectrally unresolved [NeII] emission in these less evolved systems arises from
jets/outflows rather than from the disk. The pattern of the [NeII] detections
and non-detections suggests that extreme UV-driven photoevaporation starts only
at a later stage in the disk evolution.

low-energy photons, is a common feature in Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs). Norris et
al. 2000 reported a correlation between the spectral lag and the isotropic peak
luminosity of GRBs based on a limited sample. More recently, a number of
authors have provided further support for this correlation using arbitrary
energy bands of various instruments. In this paper we report on a systematic
extraction of spectral lags based on the largest Swift sample to date of 31
GRBs with measured redshifts. We extracted the spectral lags for all
combinations of the standard Swift hard x-ray energy bands: 15-25 keV, 25-50
keV, 50-100 keV and 100-200 keV and plotted the time dilation corrected lag as
a function of isotropic peak luminosity. The mean value of the correlation
coefficient for various channel combinations is -0.68 with a chance probability
of ~ 0.7 x 10^{-3}. In addition, the mean value of the power-law index is 1.4
+/- 0.3. Hence, our study lends support for the existence of a lag-luminosity
correlation, albeit with large scatter.

selection of a prior distribution on the space of doubly stochastic matrices

the derivation of a simple formula for the Jeffreys prior and showing that it
is proper. It is known in the literature that for a complex problem like the
one treated here, the above results are difficult to obtain. The Bayes
estimator resulting from the Jeffreys prior is then evaluated numerically via
Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology. A rather extensive simulation experiment
is carried out. In many cases, the results favour the Bayes estimator over
frequentist estimators such as the standard kernel estimator and Deheuvels'

the intergalactic medium (IGM) at redshift z > 6 is through the detection and
characterization of the Gunn-Peterson (GP) damping wing absorption of the IGM
in bright quasar spectra. However, the use of quasar spectra to measure the IGM
damping wing requires a model of the quasar's intrinsic Lyman-alpha emission
line. Here we quantify the uncertainties in the intrinsic line shapes, and how
those uncertainties affect the determination of the IGM neutral fraction. We
have assembled a catalog of high-resolution HST spectra of the emission lines
of unobscured low-redshift quasars, and have characterized the variance in the
shapes of their lines. We then add simulated absorption from the high-redshift
IGM to these quasar spectra in order to determine the corresponding
uncertainties in reionization constraints using current and future samples of z
> 6 quasar spectra. We find that, if the redshift of the Lyman-alpha emission
line is presumed to coincide with the systemic redshift determined from metal
lines, the inferred IGM neutral fraction is systematically biased to low values
due to a systematic blueshift of the Lyman-alpha line relative to the metal
lines. If a similar blueshift persists in quasars at z > 6, this bias
strengthens previous claims of a significant neutral hydrogen fraction at z ~
6. This technique is capable of making a robust distinction between a highly
ionized (x_IGM ~ 10^-3) and a neutral (x_IGM = 1) IGM with even a few bright
quasars.

In order to perform their
function, most of them need energy, e.g. either in the form of a photon, like
in the case of the visual pigment rhodopsin, or through the breaking of a
chemical bond, as in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Such energy,
in turn, has to be transmitted to specific locations, often several tens of
Angstroms away from where it is initially released. Here we show, within the
framework of a coarse-grained nonlinear network model, that energy in a protein
can jump from site to site with high yields, covering in many instances
remarkably large distances. Following single-site excitations, few specific
sites are targeted, systematically within the stiffest regions. Such energy
transfers mark the spontaneous formation of a localized mode of nonlinear
origin at the destination site, which acts as an efficient energy-accumulating
centre. Interestingly, yields are found to be optimum for excitation energies
in the range of biologically relevant ones.
