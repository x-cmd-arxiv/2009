high-energy photons or leptons and photons, but no proton-antiproton pairs, to
be compatible with PAMELA's data. We investigate photons produced directly from
two-body decay chains and photons produced together with charged particles. For
the former case we also include the process DM(+DM) -> N phi -> 2N gamma which
can arise from specific strongly-coupled dark matter scenarios. For the latter
case, photons are either generated by final state radiation from high-energy
leptons or are directly generated from contact interactions represented by
higher-order (non-renormalizable) operators obtained after integrating out
heavy modes. We compare their overall annihilation cross-sections/decay rates
taking into account chiral suppression (in the s-wave approximation), dimension
of operators and dark matter particle properties. A rough estimate shows that,
for a dark matter particle with a mass of O(1 TeV), the hard photon spectra in
direct electron-positron-photon final states arising from either scalar boson
dark matter annihilation/decay or Majorana fermion dark matter annihilation are
dominated by higher-order operators if the scale of the leading operator is
lower than O(1000 TeV). Otherwise, all the photon spectra arising in this way
are dominated by final state radiation. Among the spectra studied, the
higher-order operators spectrum is the hardest while the final state radiation
spectrum with an intermediate decay is the softest.

those who are allowed to use arbitrary strategies, not limited to local
operations, as long as their strategies cannot be used for communication
between them. Study of multi-prover interactive proof systems with no-signaling
provers is motivated by study of those with provers sharing quantum states. The
relation between them is that no-signaling strategies include all the
strategies realizable by provers sharing arbitrary entangled quantum states,
and more.
  This paper shows that two-prover one-round interactive proof systems with
no-signaling provers only accept languages in PSPACE. Combined with the
protocol for PSPACE by Ito, Kobayashi and Matsumoto (CCC 2009), this implies
MIPns(2,1)=PSPACE, where MIPns(2,1) is the class of languages having a
two-prover one-round interactive proof system with no-signaling provers. This
is proved by constructing a fast parallel algorithm which approximates within
an additive error the maximum value of a two-player one-round game achievable
by cooperative no-signaling players. The algorithm uses the fast parallel
algorithm for the mixed packing and covering problem by Young (FOCS 2001).

The results imply that in Yb1-xLuxAl3 the hybridization gap, resulting from

T*(x) the relaxation time divergence, governed by the relaxation bottleneck due

emission and absorption features produced in the inner regions of an accretion
disc. We discuss the method employing the relativistic line profiles of iron in
the X-ray domain, where the emergent spectrum is blurred by general
relativistic effects. Precision of spectra fitting procedure could be
compromised by inappropriate account of the angular distribution of the disc
emission. Often a unique profile is assumed, invariable over the entire range
of radii in the disc and energy in the spectral band. We study how sensitive
the spin determination is to the assumptions about the intrinsic angular
distribution of the emitted photons. We find that the uncertainty of the
directional emission distribution translates to 20% uncertainty in
determination of the marginally stable orbit. By assuming a rotating black hole
in the centre of an accretion disc, we perform radiation transfer computations
of an X-ray irradiated disc atmosphere to determine the directionality of
outgoing X-rays in the 2-10 keV energy band. We implemented the simulation
results as a new extension to the KY software package for X-ray spectra fitting
of relativistic accretion disc models. Although the parameter space is rather
complex, leading to a rich variety of possible outcomes, we find that on
average the isotropic directionality reproduces our model data to the best
precision. Our results also suggest that an improper usage of limb darkening
can partly mimic a steeper profile of radial emissivity. We demonstrate these

For such maximally extended (or ""critical"") models the outer boundary has a
generally triaxial shape, given by the zero-velocity surface of the relevant
Jacobi integral, which is basically independent of the concentration parameter.
In turn, the external tidal field can give rise to significant global
departures from spherical symmetry (as measured, for example, by the quadrupole
of the mass distribution of the stellar system) only for low-concentration
models, for which the allowed maximal value of the tidal strength can be
relatively high. In this paper we describe in detail the intrinsic and the
projected structure and kinematics of the models, covering the entire parameter
space, from the case of sub-critical (characterized by ""underfilling"" of the
relevant Roche volume) to that of critical models. The intrinsic properties can
be a useful starting point for numerical simulations and other investigations
that require initialization of a stellar system in dynamical equilibrium. The
projected properties are a key step in the direction of a comparison with
observed globular clusters and other candidate stellar systems.

diversity confound efforts to determine the genetic basis of complex disease.
Due to technological advances it is now possible to measure hundreds of
thousands of genetic variants per individual across the genome. Principal
component analysis (PCA) is routinely used to summarize the genetic similarity
between subjects. The eigenvectors are interpreted as dimensions of ancestry.
We build on this idea using a spectral graph approach. In the process we draw
on connections between multidimensional scaling and spectral kernel methods.
Our approach, based on a spectral embedding derived from the normalized
Laplacian of a graph, can produce more meaningful delineation of ancestry than
by using PCA. The method is stable to outliers and can more easily incorporate
different similarity measures of genetic data than PCA. We illustrate a new
algorithm for genetic clustering and association analysis on a large,
genetically heterogeneous sample.

significantly to the extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGB) radiation. We
here use the high-resolution Millennium-II simulation of cosmic structure
formation to produce the first full-sky maps of the expected radiation coming
from extragalactic dark matter structures. Our map making procedure takes into
account the total gamma-ray luminosity from all haloes and their subhaloes, and
includes corrections for unresolved components of the emission as well as an
extrapolation to the damping scale limit of neutralinos. Our analysis also
includes a proper normalization of the signal according to a specific

allow a study of the angular power spectrum of the gamma-ray background from
dark matter annihilation, which has distinctive features associated with the
nature of the annihilation process and may be detectable in forthcoming
observations by the recently launched FERMI satellite. Our results are in broad
agreement with analytic models for the gamma-ray background, but they also
include higher-order correlations not readily accessible in analytic
calculations and, in addition, provide detailed spectral information for each

their envelope in increasingly massive stellar winds. Such winds affect the
interstellar medium and the galactic chemical evolution as well as the
circumstellar envelope where planetary nebulae form subsequently.
Characteristics of this mass loss depend on both stellar properties and
properties of gas and dust in the wind formation region. In this paper we
present an approach towards studies of mass loss using both observations and
models, focusing on the stage where the stellar envelope is nearly empty of
mass. In a recent study we measure the mass-loss evolution, and other
properties, of four planetary nebulae in the Galactic Disk. Specifically we use
the method of integral field spectroscopy on faint halos, which are found
outside the much brighter central parts of a planetary nebula. We begin with a
brief comparison between our and other observational methods to determine
mass-loss rates in order to illustrate how they differ and complement each
other. An advantage of our method is that it measures the gas component
directly requiring no assumptions of properties of dust in the wind. Thereafter
we present our observational approach in more detail in terms of its validity
and its assumptions. In the second part of this paper we discuss capabilities
and assumptions of current models of stellar winds. We propose and discuss
improvements to such models that will allow meaningful comparisons with our
observations. Currently the physically most complete models include too little
mass in the model domain to permit a formation of winds with as high mass-loss
rates as our observations show.

currently forming stars, there are significant populations of red star-forming

galaxies belonging to the latter two categories. These properties include
morphological parameters, internal extinction, spectral features such as
EW(H_delta) and the 4000 ang break, and metallicity. Our analysis shows that
the blue passive galaxies have properties very similar to their SF

truncation of star formation. The red SF galaxies fall into two broad
categories, one of them being massive galaxies in cluster cores dominated by an
old stellar population, but with evidence of current star formation in the
core. For the remaining red SF galaxies it is evident from various metallicity
measures and mean stellar ages, that their colours result from the predominance
of a metal-rich stellar population. The implication of the properties of these

as viable dark matter candidates, we have constructed a generalization of
relativistic Boson Stars (BS) composed of two coexisting states of the scalar
field, the ground state and the first excited state. We have studied the
dynamical evolution of these Multi-state Boson Stars (MSBS) under radial
perturbations, using numerical techniques. We show that stable MSBS can be
constructed, when the number of particles in the first excited state, N2, is
smaller than the number of particles in the ground state, N1. On the other
hand, when N2 > N1, the configurations are initially unstable. However, they
evolve and settle down into stable configurations. In the stabilization
process, the initially ground state is excited and ends in a first excited
state, whereas the initially first excited state ends in a ground state. During
this process, both states emit scalar field radiation, decreasing their number
of particles. This behavior shows that even though BS in the first excited
state are intrinsically unstable under finite perturbations, the configuration
resulting from the combination of this state with the ground state produces
stable objects. Finally we show in a qualitative way, that stable MSBS could be
realistic models of dark matter galactic halos, as they produce rotation curves
that are flatter at large radii than the rotation curves produced by BS with
only one state.

combined shows a q-shaped track similar to that observed in previous outbursts.
The evolution through the HID suggests that in the early phase of the outburst
the source underwent a sequence of state transitions, from the hard to the soft
state, which is supported by our timing analysis. Broadband (4-200 keV)
spectra, fitted with an exponentially cutoff powerlaw, show that the hard
spectral component steepens during the transition from the hard to the soft
state. The high-energy cutoff decreased monotonically from 120 to 60 keV during
the brightening of the hard state, but increased again to 100 keV during the
softening in the hard intermediate state. In the short-lived soft intermediate
state the cutoff energy was ~ 130 keV, but was no longer detected in the soft
state. This is one of the first times that the high-energy cut-off has been
followed in such detail across several state transitions. We find that in
comparison to several other spectral parameters, the cut-off energy changes
more rapidly, just like the timing properties. The observed behaviour of the
high energy cutoff of GX 339-4 is also similar to that observed with
RXTE-INTEGRAL-Swift during the 2005 outburst of GRO J1655-40. These results

waves (GW) and high-energy neutrinos (HEN). Both GW and HEN are alternative
cosmic messengers that may escape very dense media and travel unaffected over
cosmological distances, carrying information from the innermost regions of the
astrophysical engines. For the same reasons, such messengers could also reveal
new, hidden sources that were not observed by conventional photon astronomy.
  Requiring the consistency between GW and HEN detection channels shall enable
new searches as one has significant additional information about the common
source. A neutrino telescope such as ANTARES can determine accurately the time
and direction of high energy neutrino events, while a network of gravitational
wave detectors such as LIGO and VIRGO can also provide timing/directional
information for gravitational wave bursts. By combining the information from
these totally independent detectors, one can search for cosmic events that may
arrive from common astrophysical sources.

(CHs) were analyzed. A statistical study of 44 CHs based on Solar and
Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)/MDI full disk magnetograms and SOHO/EIT 284\AA
images showed that the density of the net magnetic flux, $B_{{\rm net}}$, does
not correlate with the associated solar wind speeds, $V_x$. Both the area and
net flux of CHs correlate with the solar wind speed and the corresponding
spatial Pearson correlation coefficients are 0.75 and 0.71, respectively. A
possible explanation for the low correlation between $B_{{\rm net}}$ and $V_x$
is proposed. The observed non-correlation might be rooted in the structural
complexity of the magnetic field. As a measure of complexity of the magnetic
field, the filling factor, $ f(r)$, was calculated as a function of spatial
scales. In CHs, $f(r)$ was found to be nearly constant at scales above 2 Mm,
which indicates a monofractal structural organization and smooth temporal
evolution. The magnitude of the filling factor is 0.04 from the Hinode SOT/SP
data and 0.07 from the MDI/HR data. The Hinode data show that at scales smaller
than 2 Mm, the filling factor decreases rapidly, which means a mutlifractal
structure and highly intermittent, burst-like energy release regime. The
absence of necessary complexity in CH magnetic fields at scales above 2 Mm
seems to be the most plausible reason why the net magnetic flux density does
not seem to be related to the solar wind speed: the energy release dynamics,
needed for solar wind acceleration, appears to occur at small scales below 1
Mm.

confinement resonances in corresponding partial photoionization cross sections
sigma_{nl} of Ne in any charged Ne@C60^{z-} remain almost intact by a charge z

additional, strong, z-dependent resonances, termed Coulomb confinement
resonances, as a general occurrence. Furthermore, near the innermost 1s
ionization threshold, the 2p photoionization cross section sigma_{2p} of the
outermost 2p subshell of thus confined Ne is found to inherit the confinement
resonance structure of the 1s photoionization spectrum, via interchannel
coupling. As a result, new confinement resonances emerge in the 2p
photoionization cross section of the confined Ne atom at photoelectron energies
which exceed the 2p threshold by about a thousand eV, i.e., far above where
conventional wisdom said they would exist. Thus, the general possibility for
confinement resonances to resurrect in photoionization spectra of encapsulated

galaxy M 51 with the ``standard'' photoionization model, in which the Lyman
continuum (Lyc) escaping from H II regions propagates large distances into the
diffuse interstellar medium (ISM). The diffuse H_alpha emission of M 51 is
analyzed using thin slab models and exponential disk models in the context of
the ``on-the-spot'' approximation. The scale height of the ionized gas needed
to explain the diffuse H_alpha emission with the scenario is found to be of the
order of ~ 1-2 kpc, consistent with those of our Galaxy and edge-on galaxies.
The model also provides a vertical profile, when the galaxy is viewed edge-on,
consisting of two-exponential components. However, it is found that an
incredibly low absorption coefficient of kappa_0 ~ 0.4-0.8 kpc^{-1} at the
galactic plane, or, equivalently, an effective cross-section as low as
sigma_eff ~ 10^{-5} of the photoionization cross-section at 912A is required to
allow the stellar Lyc photons to travel through the H I disk. Such a low
absorption coefficient is out of accord with the properties of the ISM.
Furthermore, we found that even the model that has the DIG phase only and no H
I gas phase shows highly concentrated H_alpha emissions around H II regions,
and can account for only < 26% of the H_alpha luminosity of the DIG. This
result places a strong constraint on the ionizing source of the DIG. We also
report that the H_alpha intensity distribution functions not only of the DIG,
but also of H II regions in M 51, appear to be lognormal.

are most likely driven by supernova explosions in the galactic disk and bulge.
We utilize Chandra, HST, and Spitzer data as well as ground-based observations
to characterize the content, structure, and physical state of the medium and
its interplay with stars in NGC5866. A cold gas disk is detected with an
exponential scale height of 100pc. Numerous off-disk dusty spurs are clearly
present: prominent ones can extend as far as 300pc from the galactic plane and
are probably produced by individual SNe, whereas faint filaments can have ~ kpc
scale and are likely produced by SNe collectively in disk/bulge. We also detect
substantial amounts of diffuse Ha- and Pa-emitting gas with a comparable scale
height as the cold gas. We find that the heating of the dust and warm ionized
gas cannot be explained by the radiation from evolved stars alone, strongly
indicating the presence of young stars in the disk at a low formation rate of ~
0.05Msun/yr. We reveal the presence of diffuse X-ray-emitting hot gas, which
extends as far as 3.5kpc from the disk and can be heated easily by Type Ia SNe
in the bulge. However, the temperature of this gas is ~ 0.2keV, substantially
lower than what might be expected from the mass-loss of evolved stars and Type
Ia SNe heating alone, indicating mass loading from cool gas is important. The
total masses of the cold, warm and hot gases are ~ 5*10^8, 10^4 and 3*10^7Msun.
The relative richness of the gases, undergoing circulations between disk/halo,

dynamic models is a recurrent issue in the theoretical ecology literature. In
the scalar case, R. Lande pointed out that results are ambiguous depending on
whether the noise is added at arithmetic or logarithmic scale, while the matrix
case has been investigated by S. Tuljapurkar. Our contribution consists first
in introducing another notion of variability than the widely used variance or
coefficient of variation, namely the so-called convex orders. Second, in
population dynamics matrix models, we focus on how matrix components depend
functionaly on uncertain environmental factors. In the log-convex case, we show
that, in a sense, environmental variability increases both mean population size
and mean log-population size and makes them more variable. Our main result is
that specific analytical dependence coupled with appropriate notion of
variability lead to wide generic results, valid for all times and not only
asymptotically, and requiring no assumptions of stationarity, of normality, of
independency, etc. Though the approach is different, our conclusions are
consistent with previous results in the literature. However, they make it clear

formulation of the Einstein equations in spherical symmetry which is regular at
the origin. The generalized harmonic approach has attracted significant
attention in numerical relativity over the past few years, especially as
applied to the problem of binary inspiral and merger. A key issue when using
the technique is the choice of the gauge source functions, and recent work has
provided several prescriptions for gauge drivers designed to evolve these
functions in a controlled way. We numerically investigate the parameter spaces
of some of these drivers in the context of fully non-linear collapse of a real,
massless scalar field, and determine nearly optimal parameter settings for
specific situations. Surprisingly, we find that many of the drivers that
perform well in 3+1 calculations that use Cartesian coordinates, are
considerably less effective in spherical symmetry, where some of them are, in
fact, unstable.

was studied before experimentally for gammas and low energetic neutrons. Almost
no information exists for fast neutrons. Therefore, we organized our studies
under the following aspects: - We investigated the influence of 11 MeV neutrons
on the position resolution of ATLAS MDT chambers. At flux densities between 4
and 16 kHz/cm2, almost no influence on the position resolution was found, it
degrades by only 10 mum at a detection efficiency of only 4*10-4. - We
investigated inert gas mixtures on fastness and linearity of their
position-drifttime (r-t) relation. At a reduction of the maximum drift time by
a factor of 2, the use of the present hardware and electronics might be
possible. For our experimental studies we used our Munich cosmic ray facility.
Two gas mixtures show almost identical position resolution as the standard gas.
- For spectrometer regions of highest background rates we contributed to the
investigation of newly developed 15 mm drift tubes. Position resolutions have
been measured as a function of gamma background rates between 0 and 1400

through and along the stent. The profile depends only on the input/output
pressure data of the problem and some homogenized constant quantities: it is

centrality dependencies of correlators for same and opposite charges are
discussed for heavy ion collisions in RHIC energy domain 62.4 -- 200 GeV. The
magnetic field shows a significant increasing at initial energy decreasing for
intermediate and large times. Two possible scenarios for initial time are
investigated in detail. Both scenarios predict the most close values for
initial time in ${Au+Au}$ collisions at 62.4 GeV. Disagreement between initial
time values obtained for two various scenarios increases with energy increasing
and for collisions of lighter ${Cu}$-nucleus. Boundary values for correlators
related with possible local $\mathcal{TIP}$ violation are calculated in the
framework of analytic approach of chiral magnetic effect for ${Au+Au}$
collisions at 62.4 and 200 GeV. The results are shown as function of collision
centrality. Preliminary experimental STAR data are compared with predictions of
chiral magnetic effect model directly. Experimental signals consistent with
model expectations for both same and opposite charge correlations in ${Au+Au}$
collisions at 62.4 GeV at all centralities. At higher energy 200 GeV the model
of chiral magnetic effect underestimates same charge correlator values for
central and midcentral events but the same charge correlations for peripheral
events as well as opposite charge correlations are in the boundaries predicted
by model calculations.

from incident circular Lauerre-Gaussian modes are studied theoretically. The
complex amplitude distribution of a diffracted beam is described by models of
the Kummer beam or of the hypergeometric-Gaussian beam. Physically, in most
cases its structure is formed under the influence of the divergent spherical
wave originating from the discontinuity in the beam spatial profile or its
derivatives caused by the hologram's groove bifurcation. Presence of this wave
is manifested by the ripple structure in the near-field diffracted beam
profiles and in the power-law amplitude decay at the beam periphery. Conditions
when the divergent wave is not excited are discussed.
  The diffracted beam carries a screw wavefront dislocation (optical vortex)
whose order equals to algebraic sum of the incident beam azimuthal index and
the topological charge of the singularity imparted by the hologram. The input
beam singularity can be healed when the above sum is zero. In such cases the
diffracted beam can provide better energy concentration in the central
intensity peak than the Gaussian beam whose initial distribution coincides with
the Gaussian envelope of the incident beam. Applications are possible for
generation of optical-vortex beams with prescribed properties and for analyzing
the optical-vortex beams in problems of information processing.

more effective use of limited radio spectrum. One core component behind dynamic
spectrum access is the sensing of primary user activity in the shared spectrum.
Conventional distributed sensing and centralized decision framework involving
multiple sensor nodes is proposed to enhance the sensing performance. However,
it is difficult to apply the conventional schemes in reality since the overhead
in sensing measurement and sensing reporting as well as in sensing report
combining limit the number of sensor nodes that can participate in distributive
sensing. In this paper, we shall propose a novel, low overhead and low
complexity energy detection based cooperative sensing framework for the
cognitive radio systems which addresses the above two issues. The energy
detection based cooperative sensing scheme greatly reduces the quiet period
overhead (for sensing measurement) as well as sensing reporting overhead of the
secondary systems and the power scheduling algorithm dynamically allocate the
transmission power of the cooperative sensor nodes based on the channel
statistics of the links to the BS as well as the quality of the sensing
measurement. In order to obtain design insights, we also derive the asymptotic
sensing performance of the proposed cooperative sensing framework based on the
mobility model. We show that the false alarm and mis-detection performance of

Sept. 1982). Today, with the discovery of dark energy and the strong evidence
in favor of an inflationary start of the Big Bang, the existence of negative
pressure is widely accepted. In fundamental physics, phase transitions are
generally thought to be reversible (Cf. Ellis, New Astronomy Reviews Volume 46,
Issue 11, October 2002, P. 645). It seems likely then that if inflation has
occurred, the process should be reversible. I.e. when the increasing density in
a collapsing universe or star reaches a certain limit it should go through a
phase transition to a medium with an equation of state of the type $p=\omega
\rho$, where $-1< \omega <-1/3$. If this phase transition is fundamental, i.e.
occurs for all energy densities, a collapse will always reach a minimum radius
and bounce. If the phase transition is symmetric, the result will lead to
oscillating universes. If however the phase transition is associated with an
hysteresis effect, a collapsing star may, succeeding the bounce inflate into a
new universe with a subsequent phase transition becomes dominated by ordinary
relativistic matter. The aim of this note is study the time development of a
model which mimics this process.

coupling based on the AdS/CFT correspondence is presented. The calculation
relies on the method of complex string trajectories and on the introduction of
a modified renormalization subtraction. The obtained potential is smooth,
negative definite for all quark-antiquark separations, and develops an
imaginary part for r > r_c =0.870/\pi T . At large separations the real part of
the potential does not exhibit the exponential Debye falloff expected from
perturbation theory and instead falls off as a power law, proportional to
1/r^4.

via ARQ protocols are investigated within a Mobile Ad-hoc NET-work (MANET).
Errors occur due to outages and a success probability function is related to
each link, which can be controlled by power and rate allocation. We first
derive the expression for the network's capacity region, where the success
function plays a critical role. Properties of the latter as well as the related
maximum goodput function are presented and proved. A Network Utility
Maximization problem (NUM) with stability constraints is further formulated
which decomposes into (a) the input rate control problem and (b) the scheduling
problem. Under certain assumptions problem (b) is relaxed to a weighted sum
maximization problem with number of summants equal to the number of nodes. This
further allows the formulation of a non-cooperative game where each node
decides independently over its transmitting power through a chosen link. Use of
supermodular game theory suggests a price based algorithm that converges to a
power allocation satisfying the necessary optimality conditions of (b).
Implementation issues are considered so that minimum information exchange
between interfering nodes is required. Simulations illustrate that the
suggested algorithm brings near optimal results.

arranged creating quasi-one-dimensional molecular stacks. The intermolecular
distance in a stack (about 3.3 A) is comparable with the electron--hole
distance in the excited molecule. The mixing between Frenkel excitons (FEs) and
charge-transfer excitons (CTEs) is very essential for the excitonic and
vibronic spectra of both crystals. In this paper, we make simulations of the
linear absorption spectra of the abovementioned crystals. The basic Hamiltonian
describes the FE--CTEs mixing in the molecular stack (point group $C_i$) caused
by two transfer mechanisms, notably of the electron and the hole on the
neighbor molecules. The vibronic spectra consist of mixed excitons and one
vibrational mode of an intramolecular vibration linearly coupled with FE and
CTEs. Using the vibronic approach, we calculate the linear optical
susceptibility in the excitonic and one-phonon vibronic regions of the
molecular stack, as well as of a crystal which contains two types of
nonequivalent stacks. We put the excitonic and vibrational parameters for the
crystals of PTCDA and MePTCDI fitted in the previous studies. We analyze the
general structure and some important features of the lineshape of the linear
absorption spectra in the spectral region of 15 000--23000 cm^{-1}. We vary the
values of the excitonic linewidth and the parameters of the linear
exciton--phonon coupling and look for the values which reproduce the absorption
lineshape similar to the absorption spectra of the investigated crystals. Our
study exhibits the necessity of introducing the FE--CTEs mixing in the
interpretation of the linear absorption spectra, especially of the MePTCDI
crystal.

likely origin of the shower based on the historical records of East Asia. We
analyse the records of Jo-Seon-Wang-Jo-Sil-Lok (the Annals of the Joseon

comet C/1490 Y1 using a modified Gauss method. We find that comet C/1490 Y1 was
a periodic one and its orbital path was very similar to that of the Quadrantid
meteor stream. The determined orbital elements are perifocal passage time
Tp=2265652.2983 days (7.8 Jan. 1491 in UT), perifocal distance q=0.769 AU,
eccentricity e=0.747, semimajor axis a=3.04 AU, argument of the perifocus
omega=164.03 degrees, longitude of ascending node Omega=283.00 degrees, and

identified by van Dokkum (2005) as dry merger remnants and ongoing dry mergers.
Kinematics, stellar population absorption features, and ionisation from
emission lines, are derived. We find that approximately half of the sample
showing strong tidal features have younger stellar populations than a control
sample at a given velocity dispersion. Conversely, galaxies with weak tidal
tails and/or ongoing mergers -- with the exception of one galaxy -- do not show
this young component. This seems to indicate that the young stellar populations
observed in a significant fraction of ellipticals is the consequence of star
formation triggered by mergers. This young component is consistent with a light
""frosting"" of young stars (<2% by mass) superimposed upon a dominant, old (~11
Gyr), stellar population. In terms of stellar populations, these mergers are,
in fact, fairly dry. We found, however, that merger remnants with young stellar
populations are supported by rotation, contrary to the expectations of a major
dry merger. This suggests that the small amount of gas involved has been
sufficient to produce a dynamically cold stellar component. Half of the
galaxies with strong tidal distortion, however, are slow rotating and have
stellar populations compatible with the control sample at a given velocity
dispersion. Remarkably, none of the galaxies with velocity dispersions in
excess of 250 km/s have a young stellar component, independent of the merger
stage.

polynomial perturbation of degree one for the Lebesgue measure; the
classification of those pairs of orthogonal polynomials connected by a kind of

operators for a two (1 + 1)-dimensional (2D) gauge field theoretic model of an
interacting Hodge theory where a U(1) gauge field (A_\mu) is coupled with the
fermionic Dirac fields (\psi and \bar \psi). In this derivation, we exploit the
spin-statistics theorem, normal ordering and the strength of the underlying six
infinitesimal continuous symmetries (and the concept of their generators) that
are present in the theory. We do not use the definition of the canonical
conjugate momenta (corresponding to the basic fields of the theory) anywhere in
our whole discussion. Thus, we conjecture that our present approach provides an
alternative to the canonical method of quantization for a class of gauge field
theories that are physical examples of Hodge theory where the continuous
symmetries (and corresponding generators) provide the physical realizations of
the de Rham cohomological operators of differential geometry at the algebraic
level.

propose to refer as the Absolute Relativity Theory (ART) since it refutes the
idea of a pre-existing space-time. It includes an algebraic definition of
particles, interactions and Lagrangians. It proposed also a purely algebraic
explanation of the passing of time phenomenon that leads to see usual
Euler-Lagrange equations as the continuous version of the
Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov monodromy. The identification of this monodromy with the
local ones of the Lorentzian manifolds gives the Einstein equation
algebraically explained in a quantized context. A fact that could lead to the
unification of physics. By giving an algebraic classification of particles and
interactions, the ART also proposes a new branch of physics, namely the Mass
Quantification Theory, that provides a general method to calculate the
characteristics of particles and interactions. Some examples are provided. The
MQT also predicts the existence of as of today not yet observed particles that
could be part of the dark matter. By giving a new interpretation of the weak
interaction, it also suggests an interpretation of the so-called dark energy.

to perturbative Quantum Chromodynamic (QCD) calculations of processes involving

which the nucleon remains intact, have emerged in recent years as prime
candidates to complement this essentially one dimentional picture. The simplest
exclusive process is the deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) or exclusive
production of real photon, $e + p \to e + \gamma + p$. This process is of
particular interest as it has both a clear experimental signature and is
calculable in perturbative QCD. The DVCS reaction can be regarded as the
elastic scattering of the virtual photon off the proton via a colourless
exchange, producing a real photon in the final state. In the Bjorken scaling
regime, QCD calculations assume that the exchange involves two partons, having
different longitudinal and transverse momenta, in a colourless configuration.
These unequal momenta or skewing are a consequence of the mass difference
between the incoming virtual photon and the outgoing real photon. This
skewedness effect can be interpreted in the context of generalised parton
distributions (GPDs). In this proceeding, we examine typical measurements from
HERA and prospects for COMPASS at CERN, that can bring new insights on the

defining the magnetic configuration of the stellar wind. Using initial
parameters within the observed range for these stars, we show that the coronal

estimate for these stellar winds the time-scale of planet migration due to drag
forces exerted by the stellar wind on a hot-Jupiter. In contrast to the
findings of Lovelace et al. (2008), who estimated such time-scales using the

axial charges are investigated. Loop contributions in the two-flavor theory
appear to be perturbatively under control. A natural application for our
development is to study the pion mass dependence of lattice QCD data on hyperon
properties.

$n(x,y)=1/y$ $(y>0)$, where $y$ is the coordinate of the vertical axis in an
orthogonal reference frame in $\R^2$. We thus obtain what we call ""hyperbolic
geometrical optics"" since the ray trajectories are geodesics in the
Poincar\'e-Lobachevsky half--plane $\HH^2$. Then we prove that the constant
phase surface are horocycles and obtain the \emph{horocyclic waves}, which are
closely related to the classical Poisson kernel and are the analogs of the
Euclidean plane waves. By studying the transport equation in the Beltrami
pseudosphere, we prove(i) the conservation of the flow in the entire strip
$0<y\leqslant 1$ in $\HH^2$, which is the limited region of physical interest
where the ray trajectories lie; (ii) the nonuniform distribution of the density
of trajectories: the rays are indeed focused toward the horizontal x axis,
which is the boundary of $\HH^2$. Finally the process of ray focusing and
defocusing is analyzed in detail by means of the sine--Gordon equation.

and relationships within natural language text sources. In this framework, an
extraction task over a text collection is expressed as a query that combines
text fragments with wild cards, and the query result is a set of facts in the
form of unary, binary and general $n$-ary tuples. A significance of our
querying mechanism is that, despite being both simple and declarative, it can
be applied to a wide range of extraction tasks. A problem in querying natural
language text though is that a user-specified query may not retrieve enough
exact matches. Unlike term queries which can be relaxed by removing some of the
terms (as is done in search engines), removing terms from a wild card query
without ruining its meaning is more challenging. Also, any query expansion has
the potential to introduce false positives. In this paper, we address the
problem of query expansion, and also analyze a few ranking alternatives to
score the results and to remove false positives. We conduct experiments and
report an evaluation of the effectiveness of our querying and scoring
functions.

isomorphism type, which we call GR_n, is characterized by a geometric analogue
of the existentially closed adjacency property, and we give a deterministic

the bulk freezing pressure using a cell design that allows us to inject atoms
into the solid. Near the melting curve during injection we observe random
events during which the pressure recorded in the cell drops abruptly. These
events are accompanied by transient increases in the temperature of the cell.
We discuss these transients and conclude that they represent the solidification
of meta-stable liquid regions and the associated relief of strain in the local
solid. We also observe that further from the melting curve the transients are
no longer recorded, but that we can continue to add atoms to the solid,
increasing its density at fixed volume. We document these changes in density
with respect to changes in the chemical potential as a function of temperature
and discuss these in the context of recent theoretical work.

strength and timing of interactions. Compensation pulses relax the precision
requirements by reducing unknown but systematic errors. Using composite pulse
techniques designed for single qubits, we show that systematic errors for n
qubit systems can be corrected to arbitrary accuracy given either two
non-commuting control Hamiltonians with identical systematic errors or one
error-free control Hamiltonian. We also examine composite pulses in the context
of quantum computers controlled by two-qubit interactions. For quantum
computers based on the XY interaction, single-qubit composite pulse sequences
naturally correct systematic errors. For quantum computers based on the
Heisenberg or exchange interaction, the composite pulse sequences reduce the
logical single-qubit gate errors but increase the errors for logical two-qubit
gates.
