In spite of this, there was still hope that this would not happen for random

instances are a good model for hard instances that can not be solved by current
classical solvers, for which an efficient quantum algorithm would therefore be
desirable. Here, we will show that because of a phenomenon similar to Anderson
localization, an exponentially small eigenvalue gap appears in the spectrum of
the adiabatic Hamiltonian for large random instances, very close to the end of
the algorithm. This implies that unfortunately, adiabatic quantum optimization
also fails for these instances by getting stuck in a local minimum, unless the

formulation of quantum mechanics and shown to satisfy a commutation relation
with the Hamiltonian analogous to that of the position and momentum operators.
The ensuing time-energy uncertainty relation involves the uncertainty in the
instant of time when the wave packet passes a particular spatial position and
the energy uncertainty associated with the wave packet at the same time, as
envisaged originally by Bohr. The instantaneous rate of change of the position
expectation value with respect to the simultaneous expectation value of the
dynamical time operator is shown to be the phase velocity, in agreement with de
Broglie's hypothesis of a particle associated wave whose phase velocity is
larger than c. Thus, these two elements of the original basis and
interpretation of quantum mechanics are integrated into its formal mathematical
structure. Pauli's objection is shown to be resolved or circumvented. Possible
relevance to current developments in interference in time, in Zitterbewegung
like effects in spintronics, grapheme and superconducting systems and in

L that converts L into a 0-framed unlink. The Generalized Property R Conjecture
is that all knots have Property nR for all n.
  The simplest plausible counterexample could be the square knot. Exploiting
the remarkable symmetry of the square knot, we characterize all two-component
links that contain it and which surger to S^1 x S^2 # S^1 x S^2. We argue that
at least one such link probably cannot be reduced to the unlink by a series of
handle-slides, so the square knot probably does not have Property 2R. This
example is based on a classic construction of the first author.
  On the other hand, the square knot may well satisfy a somewhat weaker
property, which is still useful in 4-manifold theory. For the weaker property,
copies of canceling Hopf pairs may be added to the link before the handle
slides and then removed after the handle slides. Beyond our specific example,
we discuss the mechanics of how addition and later removal of a Hopf pair can

  Aims: The main goal of this study is to search for young objects in the
intragroup medium of seven compact groups of galaxies: HCG 2, 7, 22, 23, 92,
100 and NGC 92 as well as to evaluate the stage of interaction of each group.
  Methods: We used Fabry-Perot velocity fields and rotation curves together
with GALEX NUV and FUV images and optical R-band and HI maps.
  Results: (i) HCG 7 and HCG 23 are in early stages of interaction, (ii) HCG 2
and HCG 22 are mildly interacting, and (iii) HCG 92, HCG 100 and NGC 92 are in
late stages of evolution. We find that all three evolved groups contain
populations of young blue objects in the intragroup medium, consistent with
ages < 100 Myr, of which several are younger than < 10 Myr. We also report the
discovery of a tidal dwarf galaxy candidate in the tail of NGC 92. These three
groups, besides containing galaxies that have peculiar velocity fields, also
show extended HI tails.
  Conclusions: Our results indicate that the advanced stage of evolution of a
group, together with the presence of intragroup HI clouds, may lead to star
formation in the intragroup medium. A table containing all intergalactic HII
regions and tidal dwarf galaxies confirmed to date is appended.

holonomic single qubit gates on the electron spin confined to a quantum dot.
The manipulation is done in the absence (or presence) of an applied magnetic

rotate the spin state of the electron around the Bloch sphere in semiconductor
heterostructures. The dynamics of the system is equivalent to employing an
effective non-Abelian gauge potential whose structure depends on the type of
the spin-orbit interaction. As an example, we find an analytic expression for
the electron spin dynamics when the dot is moved around a circular path (with
radius R) on the two dimensional electron gas (2DEG), and show that all single
qubit gates can be realized by tuning the radius and orientation of the
circular paths. Moreover, using the Heisenberg exchange interaction, we
demonstrate how one can generate two-qubit gates by bringing two quantum dots
near each other, yielding a scalable scheme to perform quantum computing on
arbitrary N qubits.
  This proposal shows a way of realizing holonomic quantum computers in

considered bursts, and has a slope and normalisation similar to the analogous
Ep-Liso correlation defined by the time integrated spectra of different bursts

could also study the behaviour of the Ep-Liso correlation during the rising and

for the duration of different GRBs, linking tightly the burst luminosity with
the peak energy of the spectrum emitted at different times. Such a physical

[SII]/H-alpha ratio to separate the H-alpha flux contribution from the diffuse
ionized gas (DIG). After removing the DIG, we measure a slope N=0.82+/-0.05,
and an intrinsic scatter epsilon=0.43+/-0.02 dex for the molecular gas SFL. We
also measure a typical depletion timescale tau~2 Gyr, in good agreement with
Bigiel et al. (2008). The HI density shows no correlation with the SFR, and the
total gas SFL closely follows the molecular gas SFL. We assess the validity of
corrections applied in narrow-band H-alpha measurements to overcome issues
related to continuum subtraction, underlying photospheric absorption, and
contamination by the [NII] doublet. The disagreement with the super-linear
molecular SFL measured by Kennicutt et al. (2007) is due to differences in the
fitting method. Our results support a low and close to constant star formation

magnetic activity in fully convective objects on timescales of a few years. For
20 objects covering masses from 0.05 to 0.5 Msol we detect a periodic flux
modulation, indicating the presence of magnetic spots co-rotating with the
objects. The detection rate of photometric periods (~20%) is significantly
lower than in solar-mass stars at the same age, which points to a mass
dependence in the spot properties. With two exceptions, none of the objects
exhibit variability and thus spot activity in more than one season. This is
contrary to what is seen in solar-mass stars and indicates that spot
configurations capable of producing photometric modulations occur relatively
rarely and are transient in VLM objects. The rotation periods derived in this
paper range from 3 to 30h, arguing for a lack of slow rotators among VLM
objects. The periods fit into a rotational evolution scenario with pre-main
sequence contraction and moderate (40-50%) angular momentum losses due to wind
braking. By combining our findings with literature results, we identify two
regimes of rotational and magnetic properties, called C- and I-sequence. Main
properties on the C-sequence are fast rotation, weak wind braking, Halpha
emission, and saturated activity levels, while the I-sequence is characterised
by slow rotation, strong wind braking, no Halpha emission, and linear
activity-rotation relationship. Rotation rate and stellar mass are the primary
parameters that determine in which regime an object is found. (abridged)

analyzing the chemistry of various molecules that are produced following
cosmic-ray ionization, and in many cases these analyses contain significant
uncertainties. Even in the simplest case (H3+) the derived ionization rate
depends on an (uncertain) estimate of the absorption path length. In this paper
we examine the feasibility of inferring the cosmic-ray ionization rate using
the 10830 A absorption line of metastable helium. Observations through the
diffuse clouds toward HD 183143 are presented, but yield only an upper limit on
the metastable helium column density. A thorough investigation of He+ chemistry
reveals that only a small fraction of He+ will recombine into the triplet state
and populate the metastable level. In addition, excitation to the triplet
manifold of helium by secondary electrons must be accounted for as it is the
dominant mechanism which produces He* in some environments. Incorporating these
various formation and destruction pathways, we derive new equations for the
steady state abundance of metastable helium. Using these equations in concert
with our observations, we find zeta_He < 1.2*10^-15 s^-1, an upper limit about

massive stars and are a rare sub-class of Type Ibc supernovae (SNe Ibc). They
are distinguished by the production of an energetic and collimated relativistic
outflow powered by a central engine (an accreting black hole or neutron star).
Observationally, this outflow is manifested in the pulse of gamma-rays and a
long-lived radio afterglow. To date, central engine-driven SNe have been
discovered exclusively through their gamma-ray emission, yet it is expected
that a larger population goes undetected due to limited satellite sensitivity
or beaming of the collimated emission away from our line-of-sight. In this
framework, the recovery of undetected GRBs may be possible through radio
searches for SNe Ibc with relativistic outflows. Here we report the discovery
of luminous radio emission from the seemingly ordinary Type Ibc SN 2009bb,
which requires a substantial relativistic outflow powered by a central engine.
The lack of a coincident GRB makes SN 2009bb the first engine-driven SN
discovered without a detected gamma-ray signal. A comparison with our extensive
radio survey of SNe Ibc reveals that the fraction harboring central engines is
low, ~1 percent, measured independently from, but consistent with, the inferred
rate of nearby GRBs. Our study demonstrates that upcoming optical and radio
surveys will soon rival gamma-ray satellites in pinpointing the nearest
engine-driven SNe. A similar result for a different supernova is reported

supernova SN 2009bb. This event was observed to produce a relativistic outflow
likely powered by a central accreting compact object. While such a phenomenon
was previously observed only in long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs), no LGRB
was detected in association with SN 2009bb. Using an optical spectrum of the SN
2009bb explosion site, we determine a variety of ISM properties for the host
environment, including metallicity, young stellar population age, and star
formation rate. We compare the SN explosion site properties to observations of
LGRB and broad-lined SN Ic host environments on optical emission line ratio
diagnostic diagrams. Based on these analyses, we find that the SN 2009bb
explosion site has a very high metallicity of ~2x solar, in agreement with
other broad-lined SN Ic host environments and at odds with the low-redshift
LGRB host environments and recently proposed maximum metallicity limits for
relativistic explosions. We consider the implications of these findings and the
impact that SN 2009bb's unusual explosive properties and environment have on
our understanding of the key physical ingredient that enables some SNe to
produce a relativistic outflow.

months before eclipse, the interaction between the winds of the two stars
intensifies and the X-ray flux reaches maximum. The flux drops dramatically
thereafter, subsiding in about 20 days to a level that is at least a factor 10
lower than the 'high state', i.e. the X-ray emission state of the system during
the largest fraction of its 5.52 yr orbit (~e-11 erg/s/cm2). Unlike in previous
cycles, when the low state lasted about 2.5 months, observations with RXTE
showed that the X-ray flux started its recovery to normal level about 1.5
months after the minimum. We suggest that this early recovery may be due to the
fact that the companion wind reaches terminal velocity before encountering the

helped clarify the Ca2+ signalling step between NCX and SERCA behind SR Ca2+

understand the asymptotic performance-versus-complexity trade-off of multiple

measure between an error pattern and an erasure pattern, the condition for a
single error-and-erasure decoding to succeed reduces to a form where the
distortion is compared to a fixed threshold. Finding the best set of erasure
patterns for multiple decoding trials then turns out to be a covering problem
which can be solved asymptotically by rate-distortion theory. Next, this
approach is extended to analyze multiple algebraic soft-decision (ASD) decoding
of RS codes. Both analytical and numerical computations of the R-D functions
for the corresponding distortion measures are discussed. Simulation results
show that proposed algorithms using this approach perform better than other
algorithms with the same complexity.

Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are a source of high-redshift photons above 10 GeV, and
could be therefore useful as a probe of the evolving UV background radiation.
In this paper, we develop a simple phenomenological model for the number and
redshift distribution of gamma-ray bursts that can be seen at GeV energies with
the Fermi satellite and MAGIC atmospheric Cherenkov telescope. We estimate the
observed number of gamma rays per year, and show how this result is modified by
considering interactions with different realizations of the evolving EBL. We
also discuss the bright Fermi GRB 080916C in the context of this model. We find
that the LAT on Fermi can be expected to see a small number of photons above 10
GeV each year from distant GRBs. Annual results for ground-based instruments
like MAGIC are highly variable due to the low duty cycle and sky coverage of
the telescope. However, successfully viewing a bright or intermediate GRB from
the ground could provide hundreds of photons from high redshift, which would
almost certainly be extremely useful in constraining both GRB physics and the
high-redshift EBL.

of more realistically modeling these auctions, we introduce the Second-Price Ad
Auctions problem, in which bidders' payments are determined by the GSP
mechanism. We show that the complexity of the Second-Price Ad Auctions problem
is quite different than that of the more studied First-Price Ad Auctions
problem. First, unlike the first-price variant, for which small constant-factor
approximations are known, it is NP-hard to approximate the Second-Price Ad
Auctions problem to any non-trivial factor. Second, this discrepancy extends
even to the 0-1 special case that we call the Second-Price Matching problem
(2PM). In particular, offline 2PM is APX-hard, and for online 2PM there is no
deterministic algorithm achieving a non-trivial competitive ratio and no
randomized algorithm achieving a competitive ratio better than 2. This stands
in contrast to the results for the analogous special case in the first-price
model, the standard bipartite matching problem, which is solvable in polynomial
time and which has deterministic and randomized online algorithms achieving
better competitive ratios. On the positive side, we provide a 2-approximation
for offline 2PM and a 5.083-competitive randomized algorithm for online 2PM.
The latter result makes use of a new generalization of a classic result on the

region mass correlates with the number of regions as expected from the
size-of-sample effect. We find no radial gradients in region masses and ages,
even beyond the realm of Halpha emission, although there is an exponential
decrease in the luminosity density and number density of the regions with
radius. Halpha is apparently lacking in the outer parts only because nebular
emission around massive stars is too faint to see. The outermost regions for
the 5 galaxies with HI data formed at average gas surface densities of 1.9-5.9
Msun/pc2. These low average densities imply either that local gas densities are
high or sub-threshold star formation is possible. The distribution of regions
on a log Mass - log age plot is is usually uniform along log age for equal
intervals of log Mass. This uniformity results from either an individual region
mass that varies as 1/age or a region disruption probability that varies as
1/age. A correlation between fading-corrected surface brightness and age
suggests the former.

transitional change from a spin-gapped state to a Fermi-liquid state at
temperatures higher than $T_c$. The relaxation rate $1/T_1$ shows
activated-type behavior at an onset pressure, whereas Korringa-like behavior
becomes predominant at the optimal pressure, suggesting that an increase in the
density of states (DOS) at the Fermi energy leads to enhancement of $T_c$.
Nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) spectra suggest that pressure application
causes transfer of holes from the chain to the ladder sites. The transfer of
holes increases DOS below the optimal pressure. A dome-shaped $T_c$ versus

their Gini coefficient and the second moment of the brightest 20% of their

color, the spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting method, we classify EROs
into two classes: old galaxies (OGs) and young, dusty starburst galaxies (DGs).
We found that the fraction of OGs and DGs in our sample is similar, about 48
percentages of EROs in our sample are OGs, and 52 percentages of them are DGs.
To reduce the redundancy of these three different classification methods, we
performed a principal component analysis on the measurements of EROs, and find
that morphology parameters and SEDs are efficient in segregating OGs and DGs.
The [3.6]-[8.0] color, which depends on reddening, redshift, and photometric
accuracy, is difficult to separate EROs around the discriminating line between
starburst and elliptical. We investigate the dependence of the fraction of EROs
on their observational properties, and the results suggest that DGs become
increasingly important at fainter magnitudes, redder colors, and higher
redshifts.

form of matter or energy and has been detected so far only by its gravitational
effect of repulsion. Owing to its effects being discernible only at very very
large distance scales, dark energy was only detected at the turn of the last
century when technology had advanced enough to observe a greater part of the
universe in finer detail. The aim of the report is to gain a better
understanding of the mysterious dark energy. To this end, both theoretical
methods and observational evidence are studied. Three lines of evidence,
namely, the redshift data of type Ia supernovae, estimates of the age of the
universe by various methods, and the anisotropies in the cosmic background
radiation, build the case for existence of dark energy. The supernova data
indicate that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. The ages of the
oldest star clusters in the universe indicate that the universe is older than
previously thought to be. The anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background
radiation suggest that the universe is globally spatially flat. If one agrees
that the dynamics of the geometry of the universe is dictated by its
energy-momentum content through Einstein's general theory of relativity, then
all these independent observations lead to the amazing conclusion that the
amount of energy in the universe that is presently accounted for by matter and
radiation is not enough to explain these phenomena. One of the best and
simplest explanations for dark energy is the cosmological constant. While it
does not answer all questions, it certainly does manage to explain the
observations. The following report examines in some detail the dark energy
problem and the candidacy of the cosmological constant as the right theory of
dark energy.

generalizes the corresponding results from the theory of quadratic forms. It
also significantly improves the results of Green and Tao and Kaufman and Lovett

  2. For the case of degree four polynomials with high Gowers norm we show that
(a subspace of co-dimension O(1) of) F^n can be partitioned to subspaces of
dimension Omega(n) such that on each of the subspaces the polynomial is equal
to some degree three polynomial. It was shown by Green and Tao and by Lovett,

not necessarily correlated with any cubic polynomial. Our result shows that a

that the fraction of satellite galaxies (i.e. galaxies which are not the

and that satellite galaxies are therefore less common in HIPASS than in
optically selected galaxy redshift surveys. Moreover the lack of fingers-of-god
in the redshift space correlation function of HIPASS galaxies may indicate that
the HI rich satellites which do exist are found in group mass rather than
cluster mass dark matter halos. We find a minimum halo mass for HIPASS galaxies
at the peak of the redshift distribution of M~10^11 solar masses, and show that
less than 10% of baryons in HIPASS galaxies are in the form of HI. Quantitative
constraints on HOD models from HIPASS galaxies are limited by uncertainties

temperature dependent effective continuum threshold and derive constraints on
the mass, the width, and the varying effective continuum threshold. We find
that at least one of these quantities of a charmonium changes abruptly in the
vicinity of the phase transition. We also calculate the ratio of the imaginary
time correlator to its reconstructed one, $G/G_{\text{rec}}$, by constructing a
model spectral function and compare it to the corresponding lattice QCD

the spectral modification which are extracted from QCD sum rules.

accurately estimates MICs based on a panel of multiple curves reflecting
features of bacterial growth. We develop a probabilistic model for determining
whether a given dilution of an antimicrobial agent is the MIC given features of
the growth curves over time. Because of the potentially large collection of
features, we utilize Bayesian model selection to narrow the collection of

MICs, we are able to provide posterior probabilities that each dilution is the
MIC based on the observed growth curves. The methods are easily automated and

powerful way of creating near-optimal controllers by learning. It is based on
the fact that if we have a feedback controller, and we learn to compute the
gradient grad-J of its cost-to-go function, then we can use that gradient to
define a better controller. We can then use the new controller's grad-J to
define a still-better controller, and so on. Here I point out that GHJB works
indirectly in the sense that it doesn't learn the best approximation to grad-J
but instead learns the time derivative dJ/dt, and infers grad-J from that. I
show that we can get simpler and lower-cost controllers by learning grad-J
directly. To do this, we need teaching signals that report grad-J(x) for a
varied set of states x. I show how to obtain these signals, using the GHJB
equation to calculate one component of grad-J(x) -- the one parallel with dx/dt
-- and computing all the other components by backward-in-time integration,
using a formula similar to the Euler-Lagrange equation. I then compare this
direct algorithm with GHJB on 2 test problems.

UV behaviors. The spherically symmetric black hole solutions for an arbitrary
cosmological constant, which represent the generalization of the standard
Schwarzschild-(A)dS solution, has also been obtained for the
Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz theory. The exact asymptotically flat Schwarzschild type
solution of the gravitational field equations in Ho\v{r}ava gravity contains a
quadratic increasing term, as well as the square root of a fourth order

the future linear colliders, such as the ILC and CLIC, within the general
Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM). The corresponding cross-sections are computed
at the one-loop level in full compliance with the current phenomenological
bounds and the stringent theoretical constraints inherent to the consistency of
the model. We uncover regions across the 2HDM parameter space, mainly for low
tan\beta near 1 and moderate values of the relevant lambda_5 parameter, wherein
the radiative corrections to the Higgs-pair production cross sections can
comfortably reach 50% This behavior can be traced back to the enhancement
capabilities of the trilinear Higgs self-interactions -- a trademark feature of
the 2HDM, with no counterpart in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model.
Interestingly enough, the quantum effects are positive for energies around 500
GeV, thereby producing a significant enhancement in the expected number of
events precisely around the fiducial startup energy of the ILC. The Higgs-pair
production rates can be substantial, typically amounting to a few thousand
events per 500 inverse femtobarn of integrated luminosity. In contrast, the
corrections are negative in the highest energy range (1 TeV). We also compare
the exclusive pairwise production of Higgs bosons with the inclusive gauge
boson fusion channels leading to 2H+X finals states, and also with the
exclusive triple Higgs boson production. We find that these multiparticle final
states can be highly complementary in the overall Higgs bosons search strategy.

sections of Be and Ne in the exact-exchange (EXX) approximation of
time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). The main focus has been on
the frequency dependence of the EXX kernel and on how it affects the spectrum
as compared to the corresponding adiabatic approximation. We show that for some
discrete excitation energies the frequency dependence is essential to reproduce
the results of time-dependent Hartree-Fock theory. Unfortunately, we have found
that the EXX approximation breaks down completely at higher energies, producing
a response function with the wrong analytic structure and making inner-shell
excitations disappear from the calculated spectra. We have traced this failure
to the existence of vanishing eigenvalues of the Kohn-Sham non-interacting
response function. Based on the adiabatic TDDFT formalism we propose a new way
of deriving the Fano parameters of autoionizing resonances.

important issue for energy companies because of the need for planning
maintenance and capital expenditures. Lifetime data for such transformers are
complicated because transformer lifetimes can extend over many decades and
transformer designs and manufacturing practices have evolved. We were asked to
develop statistically-based predictions for the lifetimes of an energy
company's fleet of high-voltage transmission and distribution transformers. The
company's data records begin in 1980, providing information on installation and
failure dates of transformers. Although the dataset contains many units that
were installed before 1980, there is no information about units that were
installed and failed before 1980. Thus, the data are left truncated and right
censored. We use a parametric lifetime model to describe the lifetime
distribution of individual transformers. We develop a statistical procedure,
based on age-adjusted life distributions, for computing a prediction interval
for remaining life for individual transformers now in service. We then extend
these ideas to provide predictions and prediction intervals for the cumulative
number of failures, over a range of time, for the overall fleet of
transformers.

$\partial u/\partial t=\kappa\Delta u+\gamma\xi u$ with
$u:\mathbb{Z}^d\times[0,\infty)\to\mathbb{R}$, where $\kappa\in[0,\infty)$ is
the diffusion constant, $\Delta$ is the discrete Laplacian,
$\gamma\in(0,\infty)$ is the coupling constant, and
$\xi:\mathbb{Z}^d\times[0,\infty)\to\mathbb{R}$ is a space--time random medium.
The solution of this equation describes the evolution of a ``reactant'' $u$
under the influence of a ``catalyst'' $\xi$. We focus on the case where $\xi$
is the voter model with opinions 0 and 1 that are updated according to a random
walk transition kernel, starting from either the Bernoulli measure $\nu_{\rho}$
or the equilibrium measure $\mu_{\rho}$, where $\rho\in(0,1)$ is the density of
1's. We consider the annealed Lyapunov exponents, that is, the exponential
growth rates of the successive moments of $u$. We show that if the random walk
transition kernel has zero mean and finite variance, then these exponents are
trivial for $1\leq d\leq4$, but display an interesting dependence on the
diffusion constant $\kappa$ for $d\geq 5$, with qualitatively different
behavior in different dimensions. In earlier work we considered the case where
$\xi$ is a field of independent simple random walks in a Poisson equilibrium,
respectively, a symmetric exclusion process in a Bernoulli equilibrium, which
are both reversible dynamics. In the present work a main obstacle is the
nonreversibility of the voter model dynamics, since this precludes the
application of spectral techniques. The duality with coalescing random walks is
key to our analysis, and leads to a representation formula for the Lyapunov
exponents that allows for the application of large deviation estimates.

observed excesses in $e^++e^-$ spectrum, but the detailed shapes are different

known that about 23% of our universe is made of relic dark matter. If the relic
dark matter was thermally produced, the annihilation rate is constrained
resulting in the need of a large boost factor to explain the data. We will
discuss in detail how a large boost factor can be obtained by the Sommerfeld

of the velocity distribution for molecules at excited rotational levels. This
effect is observed in both Galactic and high redshift clouds. Analysis of H_2,
HD, and CI absorption lines has revealed the broadening effect in the
absorption system of QSO 1232+082 (z_{abs}=2.33771). We analyze line broadening
mechanisms by considering in detail the transfer of ultraviolet radiation (in
the resonance lines of the Lyman and Werner H_2 molecular bands) for various
velocity distributions at excited rotational levels. The mechanism we suggest
includes the saturation of the lines that populate excited rotational levels
(radiative pumping) and manifests itself most clearly in the case of
directional radiation in the medium. Based on the calculated structure of a
molecular hydrogen cloud in rotational level populations, we have considered an
additional mechanism that takes into account the presence of a
photodissociation region. Note that disregarding the broadening effects we
investigated can lead to a significant systematic error when the data are
processed.

range ferromagnetic Ising model, and some exactly solvable spin models in one

the formation of defects whose density has a power-law dependence on the
quenching rate; the power depends on the dimensionalities of the system and of
the critical surface and on some of the exponents associated with the critical

the power law of the defects then depends on the degree of non-linearity.

with the goal of characterizing the settling of dust throughout a minimum-mass
solar nebula. We compare the evolution of both compact spherical grains, as
well as highly fractal grains. Our simulations use a shearing-box formulation
to study the evolution of dust grains locally within the disc, and collectively
our simulations span the entire extent of a typical accretion disc. The dust is
stirred by gas that undergoes MRI-driven turbulence. This establishes a steady
state scale height for the dust that is different for dust of different sizes.
This sedimentation of dust is an important first step in planet formation and
we predict that ALMA should be able to observationally verify its existence.
When significant sedimentation occurs, the dust will participate in a streaming
instability that significantly enhances the dust density. We show that the
streaming instability is pervasive in the outer disc. We characterize the scale
heights of dust whose size ranges from a few microns to a few centimeters. We
find that for spherical grains, a power-law relationship develops for the scale
height with grain size, with a slope that is slightly steeper than -1/2. The
sedimentation is strongest in the outer disc and increases for large grains.
The results presented here show that direct measurements of grain settling can
be made by ALMA and we present favorable conditions for observability. The
streaming instability should also be directly observable and we provide
conditions for directly observing it. We calculate collision rates and growth
rates for the dust grains in our simulations of various sizes colliding with
other grains, and find that these rates are significantly enhanced through the
density enhancement arising from the streaming instability.

Region (BLR) model where an accretion disk and a surrounding non-disk region
with isotropic cloud velocities generate the simulated BEL profiles. The
analysis is mainly based in measurements of the full widths (at 10%, 20% and
30% of the maximum intensity) and of the asymmetries of the line profiles.
Comparing these parameters for the simulated and observed H$\alpha$ broad
lines, we {found} that the hidden disk emission {may} be present in BELs even
if the characteristic {of two peaked line profiles is} absent. For the
available sample of objects (Seyfert 1 galaxies with single-peaked BELs), our
study indicates that, {in the case of the hidden disk emission in single peaked
broad line profiles}, the disk inclination tends to be small (mostly
$i<25^\circ$) and that the contribution of the disk emission to the total flux
should be smaller than the contribution of the surrounding region.

independent instances of a function, using less than $k$ times the resources
needed for one instance, then the overall success probability will be
exponentially small in $k$. We establish such a theorem for the randomized
communication complexity of the Disjointness problem, i.e., with communication
$const\cdot kn$ the success probability of solving $k$ instances of size $n$
can only be exponentially small in $k$. We show that this bound even holds for
$AM$ communication protocols with limited ambiguity. This also implies a new
lower bound for Disjointness in a restricted 3-player NOF protocol, and optimal
communication-space tradeoffs for Boolean matrix product. Our main result
follows from a solution to the dual of a linear programming problem, whose
feasibility comes from a so-called Intersection Sampling Lemma that generalizes
a result by Razborov.

  S-ALOHA Network with Finite State Markov Fading Channels",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider the delay-sensitive power and transmission
threshold control design in S-ALOHA network with FSMC fading channels. The
random access system consists of an access point with K competing users, each
has access to the local channel state information (CSI) and queue state
information (QSI) as well as the common feedback (ACK/NAK/Collision) from the
access point. We seek to derive the delay-optimal control policy (composed of
threshold and power control). The optimization problem belongs to the
memoryless policy K-agent infinite horizon decentralized Markov decision
process (DEC-MDP), and finding the optimal policy is shown to be
computationally intractable. To obtain a feasible and low complexity solution,
we recast the optimization problem into two subproblems, namely the power
control and the threshold control problem. For a given threshold control
policy, the power control problem is decomposed into a reduced state MDP for
single user so that the overall complexity is O(NJ), where N and J are the
buffer size and the cardinality of the CSI states. For the threshold control
problem, we exploit some special structure of the collision channel and common
feedback information to derive a low complexity solution. The delay performance
of the proposed design is shown to have substantial gain relative to
conventional throughput optimal approaches for S-ALOHA.

and superconductivity at ambient pressure. With T_Curie = 3 K and T_SC = 0.6 K
it is near a quantum phase transition; the pressure needed to suppress the
magnetism is slightly higher than 1 GPa. We report simultaneous resistivity and
ac-susceptibility measurements under pressure on a polycrystal with very large
single-crystalline domains and a resistivity ratio of about 6. Both methods
confirm the phase diagram established before by resistivity measurements on a
polycrystal. The ferromagnetic phase is suppressed for P approximately 1.2 GPa.
Astonishingly, the superconductivity persists at pressures up to at least 2.4
GPa. In other superconducting and ferromagnetic heavy fermion compounds like
UGe2 and URhGe, the superconducting state is situated only inside the larger
ferromagnetic region. Therefore, UCoGe seems to be the first example where
superconductivity extends from the ferromagnetic to the paramagnetic region.

extended with three heavy Majorana right-handed fields do not have leptogenesis
in leading order, if the symmetries of mass matrices are also the residual
symmetry of the Lagrangian. In particular, flavor models that lead to a
mass-independent leptonic mixing have a vanishing leptogenesis CP asymmetry.
Based on symmetry arguments, we prove that in these models the Dirac-neutrino
Yukawa coupling combinations relevant for leptogenesis are diagonal in the
physical basis where the charged leptons and heavy Majorana neutrinos are
diagonal.
