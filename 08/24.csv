switching to a scheme that accounts for the dominant power law dependence on
the factorization scale in the operator product expansion. We introduce the
``MSR scheme'' which achieves this in a Lorentz and gauge invariant way. The
MSR scheme has a very simple relation to MSbar, and can be easily used to
reanalyze MSbar results. Results in MSR depend on a cutoff parameter R, in
addition to the mu of MSbar. R variations can be used to independently estimate
i) the size of power corrections, and ii) higher order perturbative corrections
(much like mu in MSbar). We give two examples at three-loop order, the ratio of
mass splittings in the B*-B and D*-D systems, and the Ellis-Jaffe sum rule as a
function of momentum transfer Q in deep inelastic scattering. Comparing to
data, the perturbative MSR results work well even for Q ~ 1 GeV, and the size

fragmentation of the disc to form brown dwarfs or gas giant planets. This paper
details high resolution Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations
investigating the influence of stellar encounters on disc dynamics. Star-star
encounters (where the primary has a self-gravitating, marginally stable
protostellar disc, and the secondary has no disc) were simulated with various
orbital parameters to investigate the resulting disc structure and dynamics.
This work is the first of its kind to incorporate realistic radiative transfer
techniques to realistically model the resulting thermodynamics.
  The results suggest that the effect of stellar encounters is to prohibit
fragmentation - compressive and shock heating stabilises the disc, and the
radiative cooling is insufficient to trigger gravitational instability. The
encounter strips the outer regions of the disc (either through tidal tails or
by capture of matter to form a disc around the secondary), which triggers a
readjustment of the primary disc to a steeper surface density profile (and a
flatter Toomre Q profile). The disc around the secondary plays a role in the
potential capture of the secondary to form a binary. However, this applies only
to orbits that are parabolic - hyperbolic encounters do not form a secondary
disc, and are not captured.

transform (PFT) of the conformal camera, which numerically integrates the head,
eyes, and visual cortex, is used to process visual information during saccadic
eye movements. Although we make three saccades per second at the eyeball's
maximum speed of 700 deg/sec, our visual system accounts for these incisive eye
movements to produce a stable percept of the world. This visual constancy is
maintained by neuronal receptive field shifts in various retinotopically
organized cortical areas prior to saccade onset, giving the brain access to
visual information from the saccade's target before the eyes' arrival. It
integrates visual information acquisition across saccades. Our modeling
utilizes basic properties of PFT. First, PFT is computable by FFT in complex
logarithmic coordinates that approximate the retinotopy. Second, a translation
in retinotopic (logarithmic) coordinates, modeled by the shift property of the
Fourier transform, remaps the presaccadic scene into a postsaccadic reference
frame. It also accounts for the perisaccadic mislocalization observed by human
subjects in laboratory experiments. Because our modeling involves
cross-disciplinary areas of conformal geometry, abstract and computational
harmonic analysis, computational vision, and visual neuroscience, we include
the corresponding background material and elucidate how these different areas
interwove in our modeling of primate perception. In particular, we present the
physiological and behavioral facts underlying the neural processes related to
our modeling. We also emphasize the conformal camera's geometry and discuss how

design, interaction, and collaboration, we distinguish different gesture
families: representational (entity designating or specifying), organisational

focalising, discourse and interaction modulating, and disambiguating gestures.
Discussion and conclusion concern the following points. It is impossible to
attribute fixed functions to particular gesture forms. ""Designating"" gestures
may also have a design function. The gestures identified in A1 possess a
certain generic character. The gestures identified are neither systematically
irreplaceable, nor optional accessories to speech or drawing. We discuss the

vector mismatch (FWM) between the FM and EDSC regions, and effective barrier
are investigated. It is shown that there exits midgap surface state (MSS)
contribution to the conductance to which Andreev reflections are largely
modified due to the interplay between the exchange field of ferromagnetic metal

occur which could further test the existence of AF order in EDSC. Finally, we

the chemical potential is determined only by the screening constant. Thus the
gap is strictly proportional to the gate voltage or the carrier concentration
in the absence of donors or acceptors. In the opposite case, where the donors
or acceptors are present, the gap demonstrates the asymmetrical behavior on the
electron and hole sides of the gate bias. A comparison with experimental data
obtained by Kuzmenko et al demonstrates the good agreement.

We analyse the maps in terms of their probability density functions (PDFs) and
structure functions. Total intensity emission is more smooth in the plane than
at high latitudes due to the different contributions from the regular and
random magnetic field. The high latitude fields show more extended polarized
emission and RM structures than those in the plane, where patchy emission
structures on very small scales dominate. The RM PDFs in the plane are close to
Gaussians, but clearly deviate from that at high latitudes. The RM structure
functions show smaller amplitudes and steeper slopes towards high latitudes.
These results emerge from the fact that much more turbulent cells are passed
through by the line-of-sights in the plane. Although the simulated random
magnetic field components distribute in 3D, the magnetic field spectrum
extracted from the structure functions of RMs conforms to 2D in the plane and
approaches 3D at high latitudes. This is partly related to the outer scale of
the turbulent magnetic field, but mainly to the different lengths of the

application of this methodology, we identify HT pairs of spline wavelets of a
specific flavor, which are then combined to realize a family of complex

  Analytic wavelets, derived from the complexification of HT wavelet pairs,
exhibit a one-sided spectrum. Based on the tensor-product of such analytic
wavelets, and, in effect, by appropriately combining four separable
biorthogonal wavelet bases of L^2(R^2), we then discuss a methodology for
constructing 2D directional-selective complex wavelets. In particular,
analogous to the HT correspondence between the components of the 1D

using cluster-level covariates. It achieves the parsimony of parametrization

semiparametric model also accounts for within-cluster correlation. Local,

shift-invariance than the conventional discrete wavelet transform. We propose
an amplitude-phase representation of the DT-CWT which, among other things,
offers a direct explanation for the improvement in the shift-invariance. The
representation is based on the shifting action of the group of fractional
Hilbert transform (fHT) operators, which extends the notion of arbitrary
phase-shifts from sinusoids to finite-energy signals (wavelets in particular).
In particular, we characterize the shiftability of the DT-CWT in terms of the
shifting property of the fHTs. At the heart of the representation are certain
fundamental invariances of the fHT group, namely that of translation, dilation,
and norm, which play a decisive role in establishing the key properties of the
transform. It turns out that these fundamental invariances are exclusive to
this group.
  Next, by introducing a generalization of the Bedrosian theorem for the fHT
operator, we derive an explicitly understanding of the shifting action of the
fHT for the particular family of wavelets obtained through the modulation of
lowpass functions (e.g., the Shannon and Gabor wavelet). This, in effect, links
the corresponding dual-tree transform with the framework of windowed-Fourier
analysis. Finally, we extend these ideas to the multi-dimensional setting by
introducing a directional extension of the fHT, the fractional directional
Hilbert transform. In particular, we derive a signal representation involving
the superposition of direction-selective wavelets with appropriate
phase-shifts, which helps explain the improved shift-invariance of the
transform along certain preferential directions.

We consider an orthogonal series estimator of the slope function, by replacing
the first m theoretical coefficients of its development in the trigonometric
basis by adequate estimators. Wepropose a model selection procedure for m in a
set of admissible values, by defining a contrast function minimized by our
estimator and a theoretical penalty function; this first step assumes the
degree of ill posedness to be known. Then we generalize the procedure to a
random set of admissible m's and a random penalty function. The resulting

and also the most technically challenging. The likelihood function of the
normal mixture model is unbounded based on a set of random samples, unless an
artificial bound is placed on its component variance parameter. Moreover, the
model is not strongly identifiable so it is hard to differentiate between over
dispersion caused by the presence of a mixture and that caused by a large
variance, and it has infinite Fisher information with respect to mixing
proportions. There has been extensive research on finite normal mixture models,
but much of it addresses merely consistency of the point estimation or useful
practical procedures, and many results require undesirable restrictions on the
parameter space. We show that an EM-test for homogeneity is effective at
overcoming many challenges in the context of finite normal mixtures. We find
that the limiting distribution of the EM-test is a simple function of the
$0.5\chi^2_0+0.5\chi^2_1$ and $\chi^2_1$ distributions when the mixing
variances are equal but unknown and the $\chi^2_2$ when variances are unequal

-- is one of the principal measures used to investigate the mechanisms
subserving human and animal cognitive processes. The right tails of response
latency distributions have received little attention in experimental
psychology. This is because such very long latencies have traditionally been
considered irrelevant for psychological processes, instead, they are expected
to reflect `contingent' neural events unrelated to the experimental question.
Most current theories predict the right tail of response latency distributions
to decrease exponentially. In consequence, current standard practice recommends
discarding very long response latencies as `outliers'. Here, I show that the
right tails of response latency distributions always follow a power-law with a
slope of exactly two. This entails that the very late responses cannot be
considered outliers. Rather they provide crucial information that falsifies
most current theories of cognitive processing with respect to their exponential
tail predictions. This exponent constitutes a fundamental constant of the
cognitive system that groups behavioral measures with a variety of physical
phenomena.

proportional to its rank raised to the power -a, for some a in (0,1). Through a
rigorous analysis, we show that rank-based attachment models lead to graphs
with a power law degree distribution with exponent 1+1/a whenever vertices are
ranked according to their degree, their age, or a randomly chosen fitness
value. We also investigate the case where the ranking is based on the initial
rank of each vertex; the rank of existing vertices only changes to accommodate
the new vertex. Here, we obtain a sharp threshold for power law behaviour. Only
if initial ranks are biased towards lower ranks, or chosen uniformly at random,
we obtain a power law degree distribution with exponent 1+1/a. This indicates
that the power law degree distribution often observed in nature can be
explained by a rank-based attachment scheme, based on a ranking scheme that can
be derived from a number of different factors; the exponent of the power law

distribution q_i(y) is subjected to complete or partial mixing within some
finite zone |y| < L, where y is latitude. The change in M, the total absolute
angular momentum, between the initial and any later time is considered. For
standard quasigeostrophic shallow-water beta-channel dynamics it is proved
that, for any q_i(y) such that dq_i/dy > 0 throughout |y| < L, the change in M
is always negative. This theorem holds even when ""mixing"" is understood in the
most general possible sense. Arbitrary stirring or advective rearrangement is
included, combined to an arbitrary extent with spatially inhomogeneous
diffusion. The theorem holds whether or not the PV distribution is zonally
symmetric at the later time. The same theorem governs Boussinesq
potential-energy changes due to buoyancy mixing in the vertical. For the
standard quasigeostrophic beta-channel dynamics to be valid the Rossby
deformation length L_D >> \epsilon L where \epsilon is the Rossby number; when
L_D = \infty the theorem applies not only to the beta-channel, but also to a
single barotropic layer on the full sphere, as considered in the recent work of
Dunkerton and Scott on ""PV staircases"". It follows that the M-conserving PV
reconfigurations studied by those authors must involve processes describable as
PV unmixing, or anti-diffusion, in the sense of time-reversed diffusion.
Ordinary jet self-sharpening and jet-core acceleration do not, by contrast,
require unmixing, as is shown here by detailed analysis. Mixing in the jet
flanks suffices. The theorem extends to multiple layers and continuous
stratification. A corollary is a new nonlinear stability theorem for shear
flows.

low-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) are strongly debated. Both passive
heating of the inner collapsing envelope by the protostellar luminosity as well
as active heating by shocks and by UV associated with the outflows or accretion
have been proposed. We aim to characterize the warm gas within protosteller
objects, and disentangle contributions from the (inner) envelope, bipolar
outflows and the quiescent cloud. High-J CO maps (12CO J=6--5 and 7--6) of the
immediate surroundings (up to 10,000 AU) of eight low-mass YSOs are obtained
with the CHAMP+ 650/850 GHz array receiver mounted on the APEX telescope. In
addition, isotopologue observations of the 13CO J=6--5 transition and [C I]
3P_2-3P_1 line were taken. Strong quiescent narrow-line 12CO 6--5 and 7--6
emission is seen toward all protostars. In the case of HH~46 and Ced 110 IRS 4,
the on-source emission originates in material heated by UV photons scattered in
the outflow cavity and not just by passive heating in the inner envelope. Warm
quiescent gas is also present along the outflows, heated by UV photons from
shocks. Shock-heated warm gas is only detected for Class 0 flows and the more
massive Class I sources such as HH~46. Outflow temperatures, estimated from the
CO 6--5 and 3--2 line wings, are ~100 K, close to model predictions, with the
exception of the L~1551 IRS 5 and IRAS 12496-7650, for which temperatures <50 K
are found. APEX-CHAMP+ is uniquely suited to directly probe a protostar's
feedback on its accreting envelope gas in terms of heating, photodissociation,
and outflow dispersal by mapping 1'x1' regions in high-J CO and [C I] lines.

time series from complex systems. Starting from the concept of recurrences in
phase space, the recurrence matrix of a time series is interpreted as the
adjacency matrix of an associated complex network which links different points
in time if the evolution of the considered states is very similar. A critical
comparison of these recurrence networks with similar existing techniques is
presented, revealing strong conceptual benefits of the new approach which can
be considered as a unifying framework for transforming time series into complex
networks that also includes other methods as special cases.
  It is demonstrated that there are fundamental relationships between the
topological properties of recurrence networks and the statistical properties of
the phase space density of the underlying dynamical system. Hence, the network
description yields new quantitative characteristics of the dynamical complexity
of a time series, which substantially complement existing measures of
recurrence quantification analysis.

constrain the bulk velocity of the jet. It is definitely relativistic (v >0.1c)
and most probably in the range (0.3-0.8)c. The exact value of the velocity
depends on the accretion efficiency. These constraints are obtained
independently of, and are consistent with, previous estimates of the jet bulk
velocity based on radio measurements. We then show that the X-ray emission does
not originate in the jet. Indeed, the energy budget does not allow the corona
to be ejected to infinity at relativistic speed. Rather, either a small
fraction of the corona escapes to infinity, or the ejection velocity of the
corona is vanishingly low. Although the corona could constitute the jet
launching region, it cannot be identified with the jet itself. We discuss the
consequences for various X-ray emission models.
