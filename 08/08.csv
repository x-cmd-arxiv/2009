  quantum mechanics","23 pages, 8 figures",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a new interpretation of the terms superposition, entanglement, and
measurement that appear in quantum mechanics. We hypothesize that the structure
of the wave function for a quantum system at the sub-Planck scale has a
deterministic cyclic structure. Each cycle comprises a sequential succession of
the eigenstates that comprise a given wave function. Between unitary operations
or measurements on the wave function, the sequential arrangement of the current
eigenstates chosen by the system is immaterial, but once chosen it remains
fixed until another unitary operation or measurement changes the wave function.
The probabilistic aspect of quantum mechanics is interpreted by hypothesizing a
measurement mechanism which acts instantaneously but the instant of measurement
is chosen randomly by the classical measuring apparatus over a small but finite
interval from the time the measurement apparatus is activated. At the instant
the measurement is made, the wave function irrevocably collapses to a new state
(erasing some of the past quantum information) and continues from thereon in
that state till changed by a unitary operation or a new measurement.

found to proceed in parallel along shorter or longer sequences of stations.
Similar phenomena are observed in other networks built with space consuming
links such as cables, vessels, pipes, neurons, etc. In the case of public
transport networks (PTNs) this behavior may be easily worked out on the basis
of sequences of stations serviced by each route. To quantify this behavior we
use the recently introduced notion of network harness. It is described by the
harness distribution P(r,s): the number of sequences of s consecutive stations
that are serviced by r parallel routes. For certain PTNs that we have analyzed
we observe that the harness distribution may be described by power laws. These
power laws observed indicate a certain level of organization and planning which
may be driven by the need to minimize the costs of infrastructure and secondly
by the fact that points of interest tend to be clustered in certain locations
of a city. This effect may be seen as a result of the strong interdependence of
the evolutions of both the city and its PTN.
  To further investigate the significance of the empirical results we have
studied one- and two-dimensional models of randomly placed routes modeled by
different types of walks. While in one dimension an analytic treatment was
successful, the two dimensional case was studied by simulations showing that
the empirical results for real PTNs deviate significantly from those expected
for randomly placed routes.

series is compared with those of four kinds of surrogate data: (1) shuffled
data that contain no temporal correlation but have the same distribution, (2)
surrogate data in which any nonlinear correlation is removed but the

large positive and negative returns are replaced with small values, and (4)

on the multifractal spectrum. We also find that the temporal structure (linear

multifractal spectrum while the fat tails have major impact on $\Delta\alpha$,
which confirms the earlier results. In addition, the linear correlation is
found to have only a horizontal translation effect on the multifractal spectrum

revealed various degrees of deviation in the measured electron energy
distribution from a simple power-law, in a form of an excess around TeV
energies. An even more prominent deviation has been observed in the fraction of
cosmic ray positrons around 100 GeV energies. In this paper we show that the
observed excesses in the electron spectrum may be easily re-produced without
invoking any unusual sources other than the general diffuse Galactic components
of cosmic rays. The primary physical effect involved is the Klein-Nishina
suppression of the electron cooling rate around TeV energies. With a very
reasonable choice of the model parameters characterizing the local interstellar
medium, we can reproduce the most recent observations by Fermi and HESS
experiments. We also find that high positron fraction increasing with energy,
as claimed by the PAMELA experiment, cannot be explained in our model with the
conservative set of the model parameters. We are able, however, to reproduce
the PAMELA results assuming high values of the starlight and interstellar gas
densities, which would be more appropriate for vicinities of supernova
remnants. A possible solution to this problem may be that cosmic rays undergo
most of their interactions near their sources due to the efficient trapping in
the far upstream of supernova shocks by self-generated, cosmic ray-driven
turbulence.

discovered to show broad, asymmetric Fe K emission lines in their X-ray
spectra. These lines are generally thought to be the most prominent part of a
reflection spectrum, originating in the inner part of the accretion disk where
strong relativistic effects can broaden emission lines. We present a
comprehensive, systematic analysis of Suzaku and XMM-Newton spectra of 10
neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries, all of which display broad Fe K emission
lines. Of the 10 sources, 4 are Z sources, 4 are atolls and 2 are accreting
millisecond X-ray pulsars (also atolls). The Fe K lines are well fit by a
relativistic line model for a Schwarzschild metric, and imply a narrow range of
inner disk radii (6 - 15 GM/c^2) in most cases. This implies that the accretion
disk extends close to the neutron star surface over a range of luminosities.
Continuum modeling shows that for the majority of observations, a blackbody
component (plausibly associated with the boundary layer) dominates the X-ray
emission from 8 - 20 keV. Thus it appears likely that this spectral component
produces the majority of the ionizing flux that illuminates the accretion disk.
Therefore, we also fit the spectra with a blurred reflection model, wherein a
blackbody component illuminates the disk. This model fits well in most cases,
supporting the idea that the boundary layer is illuminating a geometrically
thin disk.

similar to the expected gaseous progenitor discs that fragmented into the
observed stellar disc in the GC. As soon as the cloud hits the black hole, gas
with opposite angular momentum relative to the black hole collides downstream.
This process leads to redistribution of angular momentum and dissipation of
kinetic energy, resulting in a compact gaseous accretion disc. A parameter
study using thirteen high resolution simulations of homogeneous clouds falling
onto the black hole and engulfing it in parts demonstrates that this mechanism
is able to produce gaseous accretion discs that could potentially be the
progenitor of the observed stellar disc in the GC. A comparison of simulations
with different equations of state (adiabatic, isothermal and full cooling)
demonstrates the importance of including a detailed thermodynamical
description. However the simple isothermal approach already yields good results
on the radial mass transfer and accretion rates, as well as disc eccentricities

favored by the fragmentation mechanism. We do not claim that these planets must

form from disk fragmentation, then these systems are consistent with what we
should expect to see. We use the orbital characteristics of these recently
discovered planets, along with a new technique to more accurately determine the
disk cooling times, to place both lower and upper limits on the disk surface
density--and thus mass--required to form these objects by disk fragmentation.
Our cooling times are over an order of magnitude shorter than those of Rafikov
(2005),which makes disk fragmentation more feasible for these objects. We find
that the required mass interior to the planet's orbital radius is ~0.1 Msun for
Fomalhaut b, the protoplanet orbiting HL Tau, and the outermost planet of HR

to isolate members of the kinematically-cold substructures. The substructures

features tend to be more metal-rich than lower surface brightness features.
Simulations of stellar halo formation via accretion in a cosmological context
are used to illustrate that the observed trend can be explained as a natural
consequence of the observed dwarf galaxy mass-metallicity relation. A
significant spread in metallicity at a given surface brightness is seen in the
data; we show that this is due to time effects, namely the variation in the
time since accretion of the tidal streams' progenitor onto the host halo. We
show that in this theoretical framework a relationship between the
alpha-enhancement and surface brightness of tidal streams is expected, which
arises from the varying times of accretion of the progenitor satellites onto
the host halo. Thus, measurements of the alpha-enrichment, metallicity, and
surface brightness of tidal debris can be used to reconstruct the luminosity
and time of accretion onto the host halo of the progenitors of tidal streams.

patch of an accretion disk, with fixed vertical gravity profile but with
different surface mass densities and a broad range of radiation to gas pressure
ratios. Each simulation achieves a thermal equilibrium that lasts for many
cooling times. After averaging over times long compared to a cooling time, we
find that the vertically integrated stress is approximately proportional to the
vertically-averaged total thermal (gas plus radiation) pressure. We map
out--for the first time on the basis of explicit physics--the thermal
equilibrium relation between stress and surface density: the stress decreases
(increases) with increasing surface mass density when the simulation is
radiation (gas) pressure dominated. The dependence of stress on surface mass
density in the radiation pressure dominated regime suggests the possibility of
a Lightman-Eardley inflow instability, but global simulations or shearing box
simulations with much wider radial boxes will be necessary to confirm this and
determine its nonlinear behavior.

brighter than M_I = -8.5 are included in the study, essentially containing
almost the entire bright half of the total GC population in the galaxy. The
classic bimodal metal-poor and metal-rich sequences of GCs show up clearly;
while the spatial distribution of the GCs can be traced detectably outward to
more than 100 kpc, the blue, metal-poor subpopulation is very much more
spatially extended than the red subpopulation. Both the red and blue GC
subsystems have radial metallicity gradients, where mean heavy-element
abundance scales with projected galactocentric distance as Z ~ R^{-0.12} (blue)
and R^{-0.17} (red). The blue sequence exhibits a strongly significant
mass/metallicity relation (MMR) in which the mean metallicity gradually
increases with cluster luminosity as Z ~ L^{0.25 \pm 0.05} for the luminosity
range M_I < -10. However, this relation is also clearly nonlinear, becoming
vertical at fainter levels. The MMR can be understood as the result of
self-enrichment within the most massive metal-poor GCs during their formation.
In giant elliptical galaxies, the red GCs are likely to represent a broad
composite population formed during several major starbursts. If so, the red
sequence might display a population-based MMR that could in principle be either
positive or negative.

literature, and are combined with CO (J=1-0) derived H_2 masses to calculate
and characterise the total gas content for a large sample of local galaxies.
The distribution in stellar mass-normalised HI content is found to exhibit the
noted characteristic transition at stellar masses of ~3x10^10 M_sun, turning
off towards low values, but no such transition is observed in the equivalent
distribution of molecular gas. H-alpha based star formation rates and specific
star formation rates are also compiled for a large (1110) sample of local
galaxies. We confirm two transitions as found in previous work: a turnover
towards low SFRs at high luminosities, indicative of the quenching of SF
characteristic of the red sequence; and a broadening of the SF distribution in
low-luminosity dwarf galaxies, again to extremely low SFRs of < 0.001 M_sun/yr.
However, a new finding is that while the upper luminosity transition is
mirrored by the turn over in HI content, suggesting that the low SFRs of the
red sequence result from a lack of available gas supply, the transition towards
a large spread of SFRs in the least luminous dwarf galaxies is not matched by a
prominent increase in scatter in gas content. Possible mass-dependent quenching
mechanisms are discussed, along with speculations that in low mass galaxies,
the H-alpha luminosity may not faithfully trace the SFR.

finite space-time grid, of an appropriate partial differential equation model
for the velocity field. Of particular interest is the characterisation,
location, and evolution of ""transport barriers"" in the flow, i.e. material
curves and surfaces. We argue that a general theory of Lagrangian transport has
to account for the effects of transient flow phenomena which are not captured
by the infinite-time notions of hyperbolicity even for flows defined for all

naturally formed a shrinking trap, in which hot electrons of several keV, in an
order of magnitude estimation, can be accelerated to nonthermal energies. A
single hard X-ray burst, with no corresponding rise in GOES soft X-ray flux,
was recorded by the Hard X-ray Telescope (HXT) on board Yohkoh, when the

with a doublet is hybridized with another with a singlet and a triplet, as a
minimal model to describe two-level quantum dots coupled to two metallic leads
in effectively a one-channel fashion. The model has a quantum phase transition
which separates regions of a doublet and a singlet ground state. The limits of
integer valence of the STAM (which include a model similar to the underscreened
spin-1 Kondo model) are derived and used to predict the behavior of the
conductance through the system at both sides of the transition, where it jumps
abruptly. At a special quantum critical line, the STAM can be mapped to an
ordinary Anderson model (OAM) plus a free spin 1/2. We use this mapping to
obtain the spectral densities of the STAM as a function of those of the OAM at
the transition. Using the non-crossing approximation (NCA), we calculate the
spectral densities and conductance through the system as a function of
temperature and bias voltage, and determine the changes that take place at the
quantum phase transition. The separation of the spectral density into a singlet
and a triplet part allows us to shed light on the underlying physics and to
explain a shoulder observed recently in the zero-bias conductance as a function
of temperature in transport measurements through a single fullerene molecule
[Roch N et al., Nature 453, 633 (2008)]. The structure with three peaks
observed in nonequilibrium transport in these experiments is also explained.

paradoxically increases the detection rate at some points on the detection

this feature by drawing an analogy between the double slit experiment and a
time reversed fire alarm. Much as closing the slit increases probability of a
future detection, ruling out fire drill scenarios, having heard the fire alarm,
increases probability of a past fire (using Bayesian inference). Classically,
Bayesian inference is associated with computing probabilities of past events.
We therefore identify this feature of the double slit experiment with a time
reversed thermodynamic arrow. We believe that much of the enigma of quantum
mechanics is simply due to some variation of time's arrow. In further support
of this, we employ a plausible formulation of the thermodynamic arrow to derive
an uncertainty in classical mechanics that is reminiscent of quantum

exists a T-duality symmetry between two-dimensional warp drives, which are
physically expressible as localized de Sitter little universes, and two
dimensional Tolman-Hawking and Gidding-Strominger baby universes respectively
correlated in pairs, so that the creation of warp drives is also equivalent to
spacetime squeezing. Perhaps more importantly, it has been also seen that the
nucleation of warp drives entails a violation of the Bell's inequalities, and
hence the phenomena of quantum entanglement, complementarity and wave function
collapse. These results are generalized to the case of any dynamically
accelerating universe filled with dark or phantom energy whose creation is also
physically equivalent to spacetime squeezing and to the violation of the Bell's
inequalities, so that the universe we are living in should be governed by
essential sharp quantum theory laws and must be a quantum entangled system.

the VLT at long time scales with emphasis on systematic errors which normally
prevent attainning a precision better than 1mas. The study is based on multi-
epoch time series of observations of a single sky region imaged with a time
spacing of 2-6 years at FORS1 and 1-5 months at FORS2. We performed a detailed
analysis of a random error of positions that was shown to be dominated by the
uncertainty of the star photocenter determination. The component of the random
error corresponding to image motion was found to be caused primarily by optical
aberrations and variations of atmospheric PSF size but not by the effect of
atmospheric image motion. Comparison of observed and model annual/monthly epoch
average positions yielded estimates of systematic errors for which temporal
properties and distribution in the CCD plane are given. At frame center, the
systematic component is about 25 mu-as. Systematic errors are shown to be
caused mainly by a combined effect of the image asymmetry and seeing variations
which therefore should be strongly limited to avoid generating random and
systematic errors. For a series of 30 images, we demonstrated presicion of
about 50 mu-as stable on daily, monthly, and annual time scales. Relative
proper motion and trigonometric parallaxes of stars in the center of the test
field were derived with a precision of 20 mu-as/yr and 40 mu-as for 17-19 mag
stars.

materials is reported. The maximum critical temperature (Tc) decreases from 51
K for R = Tb to 36 K for HoFeAsO0.9F0.1, which has been synthesised under 10
GPa pressure. This suppression is driven by a decrease in the Fe-As-Fe angle
below an optimimum value of 110.6 degrees, as the angle decreases linearly with
unit cell volume (V) across the RFeAsO1-xFx series. A crossover in electronic
structure around this optimum geometry is evidenced by a change in sign of the
compositional dTc/dV, from negative values for previously reported large R
materials to positive for HoFeAsO0.9F0.1.

Magellanic Cloud. We have utilized the second catalog of 272 molecular clouds
obtained by NANTEN to compare the cloud distribution with signatures of massive
star formation including stellar clusters, and optical and radio HII regions.
We find that the molecular clouds are classified into three types according to
the activities of massive star formation; Type I shows no signature of massive
star formation, Type II is associated with relatively small HII region(s) and
Type III with both HII region(s) and young stellar cluster(s). The radio
continuum sources were used to confirm that Type I GMCs do not host optically
hidden HII regions. These signatures of massive star formation show a good
spatial correlation with the molecular clouds in a sense they are located
within ~100 pc of the molecular clouds. Among possible ideas to explain the GMC
Types, we favor that the Types indicate an evolutionary sequence; i.e., the
youngest phase is Type I, followed by Type II and the last phase is Type III,
where the most active star formation takes place leading to cloud dispersal.
The number of the three types of GMCs should be proportional to the time scale
of each evolutionary stage if a steady state of massive star and cluster
formation is a good approximation. By adopting the time scale of the youngest
stellar clusters, 10 Myrs, we roughly estimate the timescales of Types I, II
and III to be 6 Myrs, 13 Myrs and 7 Myrs, respectively, corresponding to a
lifetime of 20-30 Myrs for the GMCs with a mass above the completeness limit, 5
x 10^4 Msun.

The CoRoT satellite searches for planets by applying the transit
method, monitoring up to 12 000 stars in the galactic plane for 150 days in
each observation run. This search is contaminated by a large fraction of false
positives, caused by different binary configurations that might be confused
with a transiting planet. Aims. We evaluate the rates and nature of false
positives in the CoRoT exoplanets search and compare our results with
semiempirical predictions. Methods. We consider the detected binary and planet
candidates in the first three extended CoRoT runs, and classify the results of
the follow-up observations completed to verify their planetary nature. We group
the follow-up results into undiluted binaries, diluted binaries, and planets
and compare their abundances with predictions from the literature. Results. 83%
of the initial detections are classified as false positives using only the
CoRoT light-curves, the remaining 17% require follow-up observations. Finally,
12% of the follow-up candidates are planets. The shape of the overall
distribution of the false positive rate follows previous predictions, except
for candidates with transit depths below about 0.4%. For candidates with
transit depths in the range from 0.1 - 0.4%, CoRoT detections are nearly
complete, and this difference from predictions is probably real and dominated
by a lower than expected abundance of diluted eclipsing binaries.
