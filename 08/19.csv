variation of horizontal shear leads to a kinematic \alpha effect with a similar
sinusoidal variation. The effect exists even for weak stratification and arises
owing to the inhomogeneity of turbulence and the presence of impenetrable
vertical boundaries. This system produces large-scale magnetic fields that also
show a sinusoidal variation in the streamwise direction. It is argued that
earlier investigations overlooked these phenomena partly because of the use of
horizontal averaging and also because measurements of \alpha using an imposed
field combined with long time averages give erroneous results. It is
demonstrated that in such cases the actual horizontally averaged mean field
becomes non-uniform. The turbulent magnetic diffusion term resulting from such
non-uniform fields can then no longer be neglected and begins to balance the
\alpha effect.

positrons, relative to standard backgrounds, for energies from ~ 10 GeV - 1
TeV. These excesses could be due to new astrophysical sources, but an
explanation in which the electrons and positrons are dark matter annihilation
or decay products is also consistent. Fortunately, the Fermi-LAT diffuse gamma
ray measurements can further test these models, since the electrons and
positrons produce gamma rays in their interactions in the interstellar medium.
Although the dark matter gamma ray signal consistent with the local electron
and positron measurements should be quite large, as we review, there are
substantial uncertainties in the modeling of diffuse backgrounds and,
additionally, experimental uncertainties that make it difficult to claim a dark
matter discovery. In this paper, we introduce an alternative method for
understanding the diffuse gamma ray spectrum in which we take the intensity
ratio in each energy bin of two different regions of the sky, thereby canceling
common systematic uncertainties. For many spectra, this ratio fits well to a
power law with a single break in energy. The two measured exponent indices are
a robust discriminant between candidate models, and we demonstrate that dark
matter annihilation scenarios can predict index values that require ""extreme""
parameters for background-only explanations.

their direct comparison with exact time evolution of the many-body Schroedinger
equation. Here, we verify instanton methods applied to coherent MQT.
Specifically applying the quasi-exact numerical method of time-evolving block
decimation to the system of bosons in a ring lattice, we directly simulate the
real-time quantum dynamics of supercurrents, where a coherent oscillation
between two macroscopically distinct current states occurs due to MQT. The
tunneling rate extracted from the coherent oscillation is compared with that
given by the instanton method. We show that the error is within 10% when the

155<s<200 Mpc/h tends to be high relative to theoretical expectations; this
slight deviation can be attributed to a bright subsample of the LRGs. Fitting
data to a non-linear, redshift-space, template based-model, we constrain the
peak position at s_p=103.6+3.6-2.4 Mpc/h when fitting the range 60<s<150 Mpc/h
(1\sigma uncertainties measured from the mocks. This redshift-space distance
s_p is related to the comoving sound horizon scale r_s after taking into
account matter clustering non-linearities, redshift distortions and galaxy
clustering bias. Mock catalogs show that the probability that a DR7-sized
sample would not have an identifiable peak is at least 10%. As a consistency

tides can also be compressive. When the potential of two galaxies overlap, as
happens during a merger, fully compressive tides can develop and have a strong
impact on the dynamics of substructures such as star clusters or tidal dwarf
galaxies. Using N-body simulations of a large set of mergers, we noticed the
importance of these tidal modes at cluster scale. With a model of the Antennae
galaxies, we conclude that the positions and timescales of these tidal modes
match the actual distribution of young clusters. A detailed study of the
statistics of the compressive tides shows a stunning correlation between this
purely gravitational effect and the observed properties of the star clusters.
In this contribution, we introduce the concept of compressive tide and show its
relevance in the special case of the Antennae galaxies. We extend our
conclusions to a broad range of parameters and discuss their implications on
several critical points such as the infant mortality, multiple star formation
epochs in clusters or the age distribution.

with the orbital period of P=26.5 d. The origin of the radio emission is
unclear,it could be due either to a jet, as in microquasars, or to the shock
boundary between the Be star and a possible pulsar wind. We here analyze the
radio spectral index over 6.7 yr from Green Bank Interferometer data at 2.2 GHz
and 8.3 GHz. We find two new characteristics in the radio emission. The first
characteristic is that the periodic outbursts indeed consist of two consecutive
outbursts; the first outburst is optically thick, whereas the second outburst
is optically thin. The spectrum of LS I +61 303 is well reproduced by the
shock-in-jet model commonly used in the context of microquasars and AGNs: the
optically thin spectrum is due to shocks caused by relativistic plasma
(""transient jet"") traveling through a pre-existing much slower steady flow
(""steady jet""). This steady flow is responsible for the preceding optically
thick spectrum. The second characteristic we find is that the observed spectral
evolution, from optically thick to optically thin emission, occurs twice during
the orbital period. We observed this occurrence at the orbital phase of the
main 26.5 d outburst and also at an earlier phase, shifted by $\Delta \Phi
\sim$ 0.3 (i.e almost 8 days before). We show that this result qualitatively
and quantitatively agrees with the two-peak accretion/ejection model proposed
in the past for LS I +61303. We conclude that the radio emission in LS I +61303
originates from a jet and suggest that the variable TeV emission comes from the
usual Compton losses expected as an important by-product in the shock-in-jet
theory.

energies, the electron-phonon renormalizations drop out of the dressed DOS,
however, due to the Dirac nature of the electron dynamics in graphene, the band
DOS is linear in energy and phonon structures remain, which can be emphasized
by taking an energy derivative. There is a shift in the chemical potential and
in the position in energy of the Dirac point. Also, the DOS can be changed from
a linear dependence out of value zero at the Dirac point to quadratic out of a
finite value. The optical scattering rate $1/\tau$ sets the energy scale for
the rise of the optical conductivity from its universal DC value $4e^2/\pi h$
(expected in the simplest theory when chemical potential and temperature are
both $\ll 1/2\tau$) to its universal AC background value $(\sigma_0=\pi
e^2/2h)$. As in ordinary metals the DC conductivity remains unrenormalized
while its AC value is changed. The optical spectral weight under the intraband
Drude is reduced by a mass renormalization factor as is the effective
scattering rate. Optical weight is transferred to an Holstein phonon-assisted
side band. Due to Pauli blocking the interband transitions are sharply
suppressed, but also nearly constant, below twice the value of renormalized
chemical potential and also exhibit a phonon-assisted contribution. The
universal background conductivity is reduced below $\sigma_0$ at large
energies.

the quantitative accuracy of the image can be significantly compromised by

western knots have been significantly decelerated or that there exists a
systematic velocity difference among the knots. One ejecta filament in the
northwestern boundary, on the other hand, is redshifted by $\simgt$ 200 \kms,
while opposite filament in the southeastern boundary shows a negligible radial
motion. Some of the knots and filaments have secondary velocity components, and
one knot shows a bow shock-like feature in the velocity structure. The iron
ejecta appear to be devoid of strong emission from other heavy elements, such
as S, which may attest to the alpha-rich freezeout process in the explosive
nucleosynthesis of the core-collapse supernova explosion close to its center.
The prominent bipolar distribution of the Fe ejecta in the northwestern and

nebula in the perpendicular direction, is consistent with the interpretation
that the supernova exploded primarily along the northwestern and southeastern

older, but the data in this part of the system is too limited to draw firm

phase between the two complex scalars (with linear dependence on, say, the $z$

string. Such twisted strings bifurcate with the Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen (ANO)

exhibit instabilities whose amplitudes grow exponentially in time. More
precisely twisted strings with a single magnetic flux quantum admit a
continuous family of unstable eigenmodes with harmonic $z$ dependence, indexed
by a wavenumber $k\in[-k_{\rm m},k_{\rm m}]$. Carrying out a perturbative
semi-analytic analysis of the bifurcation, it is found that the purely

good qualitative description of the twisted solutions themselves as well as of
their instabilities, but also a quantitative description of the numerical

this work, we generalize their result to the Laughlin states. We investigate
the noise generated in the current along the edge of a fractional quantum Hall
state at filling factors $\nu=1/m$, when a quantum point contact, initially
closed, is fully opened at some initial time $t_0=0$. We find that local
quenching in these systems gives time dependent correlation functions that have
universal behavior on sufficiently long time and length scales. We calculate
the noise and full counting statistics for $\nu=1/m$ and find that in general,
the entanglement entropy and noise generated are unrelated quantities. We also

to be diminishing, especially on the Neptune-facing hemisphere. Although it is
mostly dissolved in N2 ice, Triton's CH4 ice shows a very different
longitudinal variation from the N2 ice, challenging assumptions of how the two

variation very similar to the N2 ice, implying that CO and N2 condense and

fundamental determinations of stellar masses and radii. We have identified 95
detached binary systems containing 190 stars (94 eclipsing systems, and alpha
Centauri) that satisfy our criterion that the mass and radius of both stars be
known to 3% or better. To these we add interstellar reddening, effective
temperature, metal abundance, rotational velocity and apsidal motion
determinations when available, and we compute a number of other physical
parameters, notably luminosity and distance. We discuss the use of this
information for testing models of stellar evolution. The amount and quality of
the data also allow us to analyse the tidal evolution of the systems in
considerable depth, testing prescriptions of rotational synchronisation and
orbital circularisation in greater detail than possible before. The new data
also enable us to derive empirical calibrations of M and R for single (post-)
main-sequence stars above 0.6 M(Sun). Simple, polynomial functions of T(eff),
log g and [Fe/H] yield M and R with errors of 6% and 3%, respectively.
Excellent agreement is found with independent determinations for host stars of
transiting extrasolar planets, and good agreement with determinations of M and
R from stellar models as constrained by trigonometric parallaxes and
spectroscopic values of T(eff) and [Fe/H]. Finally, we list a set of 23
interferometric binaries with masses known to better than 3%, but without
fundamental radius determinations (except alpha Aur). We discuss the prospects
for improving these and other stellar parameters in the near future.

J1741-2054, with period P=413ms, was detected in archival Parkes telescope data
and subsequently has been detected at the Green Bank Telescope (GBT). Its
received flux varies greatly due to interstellar scintillation and it has a
very small dispersion measure of DM=4.7pc/cc, implying a distance of ~0.4kpc
and possibly the smallest luminosity of any known radio pulsar. At this
distance, for isotropic emission, its gamma-ray luminosity above 0.1GeV
corresponds to 25% of the spin-down luminosity of dE/dt=9.4e33erg/s. The
gamma-ray profile occupies 1/3 of pulse phase and has three closely-spaced
peaks with the first peak lagging the radio pulse by delta=0.29P. We have also
identified a soft Swift source that is the likely X-ray counterpart. In many
respects PSR J1741-2054 resembles the Geminga pulsar. The second source, PSR
J2032+4127, was detected at the GBT. It has P=143ms, and its DM=115pc/cc
suggests a distance of ~3.6kpc, but we consider it likely that it is located
within the Cyg OB2 stellar association at half that distance. The radio
emission is nearly 100% linearly polarized, and the main radio peak precedes by
delta=0.15P the first of two narrow gamma-ray peaks that are separated by
Delta=0.50P. Faint, diffuse X-ray emission in a Chandra image is possibly its
pulsar wind nebula. PSR J2032+4127 likely accounts for the EGRET source 3EG
J2033+4118, while its pulsar wind is responsible for the formerly unidentified
HEGRA source TeV J2032+4130.

significant population of low fractional overdensity ECHOS in the inner halo,

(fundamental mode pulsators) with ""normal"" light curves in the bulge using the
MACHO bulge fields. Although bulge globular clusters have RR Lyraes that divide
into two reasonable distinct groups according to the average period of the RR0
Lyraes (Oosterhoff 1939), there is no evidence of a gap between Oosterhoff I
and II stars in the bulge field star sample. The majority of the bulge RR0
Lyrae field star population have a difference in period compared to the
Oosterhoff I cluster M3 (Delta log P) that is shifted by about 0.02 days with
regard to the Milky Way Oosterhoff I population, and the sample includes stars
with Delta log P > 0.06 days, a characteristic hardly seen in Milky Way
globular clusters. The metal-rich RR0 Lyrae stars in the Galactic bulge sample
have Delta log P values on the other side of the spectrum as those in the
metal-rich globular clusters NGC 6388 and NGC 6441. We find that the
$V$-amplitude for a given period is a function of Delta log P, and not of metal
abundance, similar to the result found by Clement & Shelton (1999) for RR Lyrae
stars in Milky Way globular clusters. A comparative study of the bulge field
stars with similar metallicities but different Oosterhoff types is carried out.
Bulge field RR0 Lyrae variables with Delta log P values similar to Oosterhoff
II clusters are about 0.2 mag brighter than RR0 Lyrae variables with Delta log
P similar to Oosterhoff I clusters. Reliance upon a single absolute
magnitude-[Fe/H] relation may be inappropriate when considering populations
with different Delta log P.

the composition and origin of the Galactic stellar halo.
  Aims: We derive chemical element abundance ratios in red giants belonging to
the remote (R~90 kpc) GC Pal 3 and compare our measurements to those for red
giant stars in both inner and outer halo GCs.
  Methods: From high-resolution spectroscopy of four red giants, obtained with
the Magellan/MIKE spectrograph at moderately high S/N, we derive chemical
abundances for 25 alpha-, iron peak-, and neutron-capture elements. These
abundance ratios are confirmed by co-adding low S/N HIRES spectra of 19 stars
along the red giant branch.
  Results: Pal 3 shows alpha-enhanced abundance patterns, and also its Fe-peak
and neutron-capture element ratios, are fully compatible with those found in
halo field stars and representative inner halo GCs of the same metallicity
(such as M 13). The heavy elements in Pal 3 appear to be governed by r-process
nucleosyn-thesis. Our limited sample does not show any significant star-to-star
abundance variations in this cluster, although a weak Na-O anti-correlation
cannot be ruled out by the present data.
  Conclusions: Pal 3 thus appears as an archetypical GC with abundance ratios
dissimilar to dwarf spheroidal stars, ruling out a direct connection to such
external systems. This conclusion is underscored by the lack of significant
abundance spreads in this GC, in contrast to the broad abundance distributions
seen in the dwarf galaxies. Pal 3 appears to have evolved chemically coeval
with the majority of GCs belonging to Galactic inner and outer halo,
experiencing a similar enrichment history.

This paper investigates the extragalactic point source contamination and how

reach the desired RMS noise and be able to detect the 21cm transition line.
Here, we consider position and flux errors in the global sky-model for these

errors. The synthesized beam is the only frequency dependent term included
here. This work determines the level of accuracy for the calibration and source
removal schemes and puts forward constraints for the design of the cosmic

MWA,PAPER, etc. We show that in order to detect the reionization signal the
bright sources need to be removed from the data-sets with a positional accuracy
of $\sim 0.1$ arc-second. Our results also demonstrate that the efficient
foreground source removal strategies can only tolerate a frequency independent
antenna based mean residual calibration error of $\lesssim 0.2 %$ in amplitude

description. The EFP is the probability that a region of space is completely
void of particles in the ground state of a quantum many body system. We
calculate this probability in an instanton approach, by considering the more
general problem of an arbitrary depletion of particles (DFP). In the limit of
large size of depletion region the probability is dominated by a classical
configuration in imaginary time that satisfies a set of boundary conditions and
the action calculated on such solution gives the EFP/DFP with exponential
accuracy. We show that the calculation for sCM can be elegantly performed by
representing the gradientless hydrodynamics of spin particles as a sum of two
spin-less Calogero collective field theories in auxiliary variables.
Interestingly, the result we find for the EFP can be casted in a form
reminiscing of spin-charge separation, which should be violated for a
non-linear effect such as this. We also highlight the connections between sCM,
HSM and $\lambda=2$ spin-less Calogero model from a EFP/DFP perspective.

gauge interaction in models with D-branes in String Theory is examined. Instead
of elementary scalar Higgs doublet fields, the gauge symmetry with strong
coupling (technicolor) is introduced. As the first step of this direction, a
toy model, which is not fully realistic, is concretely analyzed in some detail.
The model consists of D-branes and anti-D-branes at orbifold singularities in
(T^2 x T^2 x T^2)/Z_3 which preserves supersymmetry. Supersymmetry is broken
through the brane supersymmetry breaking. It is pointed out that the problem of

solved by natural existence of kinetic term mixings between hypercharge U(1)

massive astronomical time-series data. Assuming that the dominant population of
objects is non-variable, we find outliers from this population by using a
non-parametric Bayesian clustering algorithm based on an infinite
GaussianMixtureModel (GMM) and the Dirichlet Process. The algorithm extracts
information from a given dataset, which is described by six variability
indices. The GMM uses those variability indices to recover clusters that are
described by six-dimensional multivariate Gaussian distributions, allowing our
approach to consider the sampling pattern of time-series data, systematic
biases, the number of data points for each light curve, and photometric
quality. Using the Northern Sky Variability Survey data, we test our approach
and prove that the infinite GMM is useful at detecting variable objects, while
providing statistical inference estimation that suppresses false detection. The
proposed approach will be effective in the exploration of future surveys such
as GAIA, Pan-Starrs, and LSST, which will produce massive time-series data.

strange stars exhibit a low luminosity, but high temperature bremsstrahlung

energy. Recently, new protocols called quantum energy teleportation (QET) have
been proposed, which transport energy by local operations and classical
communication with the ground states of many-body quantum systems. In this
paper, we compare two different QET protocols for transporting energy with
electromagnetic field. In the first protocol, a 1/2 spin (a qubit) is coupled
with the quantum fluctuation in the vacuum state and measured in order to
obtain one-bit information about the fluctuation for the teleportation. In the
second protocol, a harmonic oscillator is coupled with the fluctuation and
measured in order to obtain continuous-variable information about the
fluctuation. In the spin protocol, the amount of teleported energy is
suppressed by an exponential damping factor when the amount of input energy
increases. This suppression factor becomes power damping in the case of the
harmonic oscillator protocol. Therefore, it is concluded that obtaining more
information about the quantum fluctuation leads to teleporting more energy.
This result suggests a profound relationship between energy and quantum
information.

complex: thousands of individuals form multiple flocks which are continually
changing shape and density, while splitting and merging. To understand these
complex displays both empirical data and models are needed. Whereas detailed
empirical data were recently collected through video recordings and position
measurements by stereo photography of flocks of thousands of starlings, there
are as yet no models that generate these complex patterns. Numerous computer
models in biology, however, suggest that patterns of single groups of moving
animals may emerge by self-organisation from movement and local coordination
(through attraction, alignment and avoidance of collision). In this paper, we
investigated whether this approach can be extended to generate patterns
resembling these aerial displays of starlings. We show in a model that to
generate many of the patterns measured empirically in real starlings we have to
extend the usual rules of local coordination with specifics of starling
behaviour, mainly 1) their aerial locomotion, 2) a low and constant number of
interaction-partners and 3) preferential movement above a roosting area. Our
model can be used as a tool for the study of these displays, because it
provides new integrative hypotheses about the mechanisms underlying these
displays and of swarming patterns in biological systems in general.

and in the basis where the latter and the charged leptons are mass diagonal, a
near `mu-tau' symmetry in the neutrino sector is strongly suggested by the
neutrino oscillation data. There is further evidence for a close to the
tribimaximal mixing pattern which subsumes `mu-tau' symmetry. On the other
hand, the assumption of a (maximally allowed) four zero texture in the Yukawa
coupling matrix Y_nu in the same basis leads to a highly constrained and
predictive theoretical scheme. We show that the requirement of an exact
`mu-tau' symmetry, coupled with observational constraints, reduces the `seventy
two' allowed textures in such a `Y_nu' to 'only four' corresponding to just two
different forms of the light neutrino mass matrix `m_nu'. The effect of each of
these on measurable quantities can be described, apart from an overall factor
of the neutrino mass scale, in terms of two real parameters and a phase angle
all of which are within very constrained ranges. The additional input of a
tribimaximal mixing reduces these three parameters to `only one' with a very
nearly fixed value. Implications for both flavored and unflavored leptogenesis
as well as radiative lepton flavor violating decays are discussed. We also
investigate the stability of these conclusions under small deviations due to
renormalization group running from a high scale where the four zero texture as
well as `mu-tau' symmetry or the tribimaximal mixing pattern are imposed.

existence of a displacements plane attached to the tool edge point is revealed.
This plane proves to be inclined compared to the machines tool axes. We
establish that the tool tip point describes an ellipse. This ellipse is very
small and can be considered as a small straight line segment for the stable
cutting process (without vibrations). In unstable mode (with vibrations) the
ellipse of displacements is really more visible. A difference in phase occurs
between the tool tip displacements on the radial direction and on the cutting
one. The feed motion direction and the cutting one are almost in phase. The
values of the long and small ellipse axes (and their ratio) shows that these
sizes are increasing with the feed rate value. The axis that goes through the
stiffness center and the tool tip represents the maximum stiffness direction.
The maximum (resp. minimum) stiffness axis of the tool is perpendicular to the
large (resp. small) ellipse displacements axis. FFT analysis of the

stringent checks can be imposed while running these simulations. This set of
numerical experiments is designed to isolate any power spectrum dependent
departures from universality of mass functions. We show explicitly that the

2006 outburst of the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi, together with ground-based
spectroscopic observations, obtained from the Observatorio Astron\'omico
Nacional en San Pedro M\'artir, Baja California, M\'exico and at the
Observatorio Astrof\'isico Guillermo Haro, at Cananea, Sonora, M\'exico. The
observations at the first epoch were used as inputs to model the geometry and
kinematic structure of the evolving RS Oph nebular remnant. We find that the
modeled remnant comprises two distinct co-aligned bipolar components; a
low-velocity, high-density innermost (hour glass) region and a more extended,
high-velocity (dumbbell) structure. This overall structure is in agreement with
that deduced from radio observations and optical interferometry at earlier
epochs. We find that the asymmetry observed in the west lobe is an instrumental
effect caused by the profile of the HST filter and hence demonstrate that this
lobe is approaching the observer. We then conclude that the system has an
inclination to the line of sight of 39$^{+1}_{-10}$ degrees. This is in
agreement with the inclination of the binary orbit and lends support to the
proposal that this morphology is due to the interaction of the outburst ejecta
with either an accretion disk around the central white dwarf and/or a
pre-existing red giant wind that is significantly denser in the equatorial
regions of the binary than at the poles. The second epoch HST observation was
also modeled. However, as no spectra were taken at this epoch, it is more
difficult to constrain any model. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that between the
two HST epochs the outer dumbbell structure seems to have expanded linearly.

It is well
known and has been studied in detail for the past fifty years. Exact formulae
for the different cross sections are often complex, and essentially asymptotic
expressions have been used in the past. Numerical capabilities have now
developed to a point where they enable the direct use of exact formulae in
sophisticated codes that deal with all kinds of interactions in plasmas.
Although the numerical computation of the Compton cross section is simple in
principle, its practical evaluation is often prone to accuracy issues. These
can be severe in some astrophysical situations but are often not addressed
properly. In this paper we investigate numerical issues related to the
computation of the Compton scattering contribution to the time evolution of
interacting photon and particle populations. An exact form of the isotropic
Compton cross section free of numerical cancellations is derived. Its accuracy
is investigated and compared to other formulae. Then, several methods to solve
the kinetic equations using this cross section are studied. The regimes where
existing cross sections can be evaluated numerically are given. We find that
the cross section derived here allows for accurate and fast numerical
evaluation for any photon and electron energy. The most efficient way to solve
the kinetic equations is a method combining a direct integration of the cross
section over the photon and particle distributions and a Fokker-Planck
approximation. Expressions describing this combination are given.

OJ287, the binary nature is confirmed by periodic radiation pulses. The period

approach (Boundary Element Method). Two main cases are considered : a shallow
deposit in the centre of Nice (France) [1] and a deep irregular basin in
Caracas (Venezuela) [2]. The amplification of seismic motion is analysed in
terms of level, occuring frequency and location. For both sites, the
amplification factor is found to reach maximum values of 20 (weak motion). Site
effects nevertheless have very different features concerning the frequency
dependence and the location of maximum amplification. For the shallow deposit
in Nice, the amplification factor is very small for low frequencies and fastly
increases above 1.0 Hz. The irregular Caracas basin gives a much different
frequency dependence with many different peaks at various frequencies. The
model for Caracas deep alluvial basin also includes a part of the local
topography such as the nearest mountain. One can estimate seismic site effects
due to both velocity contrast (between the basin and the bedrock) and local
topography of the site. Furthermore, the maximum amplification is located on
the surface for Nice, whereas some strong amplification areas also appear
inside the basin itself in the case of Caracas. One investigates the influence
of this focusing effect on the motion vs depth dependence. This is of great
interest for the analysis of seismic response of underground structures. The
form and the depth of alluvial deposits are then found to have a great
influence on the location of maximum amplification on the surface but also
inside the deposit for deep irregular basins. It is essential for the analysis
of the seismic response of both surface and underground structures.

Several evidences (experimental, analytical, numerical) of the site-city

analysis is available when flow-aware mechanisms such as per-flow scheduling

issue by modeling via a set of fluid non-linear ODEs the instantaneous
throughput and the buffer occupancy of N long-lived TCP sources under three
per-flow scheduling disciplines (Fair Queuing, Longest Queue First, Shortest
Queue First) and with longest queue drop buffer management. We study the system
evolution and analytically characterize the stationary regime: closed-form
expressions are derived for the stationary throughput/sending rate and buffer
occupancy which give thorough understanding of short/long-term fairness for TCP

activity, culminating in the brightest optical state ever observed, during the
2004-2005 outburst. The Whole Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT) consortium has
carried out several multifrequency campaigns to follow the source behaviour.
The GLAST-AGILE Support Program (GASP) was born from the WEBT to provide
long-term continuous optical-to-radio monitoring of a sample of gamma-loud
blazars, during the operation of the AGILE and GLAST (now known as Fermi GST)
gamma-ray satellites. The main aim is to shed light on the mechanisms producing
the high-energy radiation, through correlation analysis with the low-energy
emission. Thus, since 2008 the monitoring task on 3C 454.3 passed from the WEBT
to the GASP, while both AGILE and Fermi detected strong gamma-ray emission from
the source. We present the main results obtained by the GASP at optical, mm,
and radio frequencies in the 2008-2009 season, and compare them with the WEBT
results from previous years. An optical outburst was observed to peak in mid
July 2008, when Fermi detected the brightest gamma-ray levels. A
contemporaneous mm outburst maintained its brightness for a longer time, until
the cm emission also reached the maximum levels. The behaviour compared in the
three bands suggests that the variable relative brightness of the
different-frequency outbursts may be due to the changing orientation of a
curved inhomogeneous jet. The optical light curve is very well sampled during
the entire season, which is also well covered by the various AGILE and Fermi
observing periods. The relevant cross-correlation studies will be very
important in constraining high-energy emission models.

Supercluster (CrB-SC). This paper is motivated by the detection at 33GHz of a
strong temperature decrement in the CMB towards the core of this supercluster.
Multifrequency observations with VSA and MITO suggest the existence of a
thermal SZ effect component in the spectrum of this cold spot, which would
account for roughly 25% of the total observed decrement. We identify nine
regions containing superclusters similar to CrB-SC, obtain the associated SZ
maps and calculate the probability of finding such SZ signals arising from hot
gas within the supercluster. Our results show that WHIM produces a thermal SZ
effect much smaller than the observed value. Neither can summing the
contribution of small clusters and galaxy groups in the region explain the
amplitude of the SZ signal. When we take into account the actual posterior
distribution from the observations, the probability that WHIM can cause a
thermal SZ signal like the one observed is <1%, rising up to a 3.2% when the
contribution of small clusters and galaxy groups is included. If the
simulations provide a suitable description of the gas physics, then we conclude
that the thermal SZ component of the CrB spot most probably arises from an
unknown galaxy cluster along the line of sight. The simulations also show that
the kinetic SZ signal associated with the supercluster cannot provide an
explanation for the remaining 75% of the observed cold spot in CrB.

  Conference'",,,,"astro-ph.CO astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The integrated spectro-photometric properties of star clusters are subject to
large cluster-to-cluster variations. They are distributed in non trivial ways
around the average properties predicted by standard population synthesis
models. This results from the stochastic mass distribution of the finite
(small) number of luminous stars in each cluster, stars which may be either
particularly blue or particularly red. The color distributions are broad and
usually far from Gaussian, especially for young and intermediate age clusters,
as found in interacting galaxies. When photometric measurements of clusters are
used to estimate ages and masses in conjunction with standard models, biases
are to be expected. We present a Bayesian approach that explicitly accounts for
stochasticity when estimating ages and masses of star clusters that cannot be
resolved into stars. Based on Monte-Carlo simulations, we are starting to
explore the probability distributions of star cluster properties obtained given
a set of multi-wavelength photometric data.

condensed-matter systems in non-extreme density conditions. General Relativity
and lowest-order perturbative Quantum Gravity predict in this case an extremely
small emission rate, so these phenomena can become relevant only if some strong
quantum effect occurs. Quantum aspects of gravity are still poorly understood.
It is believed that they could play a role in systems which exhibit macroscopic
quantum coherence, like superconductors and superfluids, leading to an
""anomalous"" coupling between matter and field. We mention here recent work in
this field by Woods, Chiao, Becker, Agop et al., Ummarino, Kiefer and Weber.
New results are presented concerning anomalous stimulated gravitational
emission in a layered superconductor like YBCO. We model the superconductor as
an array of intrinsic Josephson junctions. The superconducting parameters are
defined by our preliminary measurements with melt-textured samples. We write
explicitly and solve numerically the Josephson equations which give the normal
and super components of the total current in the superconductor, and derive
from this the total available power P=IV. Then, assuming that the coefficients
A and B for spontaneous and stimulated gravitational emission are known, we
apply to this case the Frantz-Nodvik equation for a laser amplifier. The
equation is suitably modified in order to allow for a ""continuous pumping""
given by an oscillating transport current. The conclusions are relevant for the
evaluation of gravitational emission from superconductors. We find that even if
the A and B coefficients are anomalously large (possibly because of the Quantum
Gravity effects mentioned above), the conditions for stimulated emission are
quite strict and the emission rate strongly limited by the IV value.

generate an effective dynamical asymmetry for an intrinsically symmetric
quantum spin -1/2. An initially fully polarized spin first decays towards a
quasiequilibrium determined by the dynamical asymmetry, thereby showing
coherent damped oscillations on the (fast) time scale of the spin splitting. On
top of this, the dynamical asymmetry itself decays on an ultraslow time scale
and vanishes asymptotically since the global equilibrium phase is symmetric. We
quantitatively study the nature of the initial fast decay to the
quasiequilibrium and discuss the features of ultraslow dynamics of the
quasiequilibrium itself. The dynamical asymmetry is more pronounced for smaller
values of the sub-Ohmic exponent and for lower temperatures, which emphasizes
the quantum many-body nature of the effect. The symmetry breaking is related to
the dynamic crossover between coherent and overdamped relaxation of the spin
polarization and is not connected to the localization quantum phase transition.
In addition to this delocalized phase, we identify a novel phase which is
characterized by damped coherent oscillations in the localized phase. This
allows for a sketch of the zero-temperature phase diagram of the sub-Ohmic
spin-boson model with four distinct phases.

lagrangian and coisotropic A-branes on Kahler manifolds to manifolds which are
not necessarily Kahler (but still bihermitian). Adding chiral fields
complicates the picture and results in hybrid configurations interpolating
between lagrangian/coisotropic branes and branes wrapping around a holomorphic

causes a non-diffusive flux of aerosols in the direction of the heat flux and
results in formation of long-living aerosol layers in the vicinity of
temperature inversions. We demonstrated that the theory of turbulent thermal
diffusion explains the GOMOS aerosol observations near the tropopause (i.e.,
the observed shape of aerosol vertical profiles with elevated concentrations
located almost symmetrically with respect to temperature profile). In
combination with the derived expression for the dependence of the turbulent
thermal diffusion ratio on the turbulent diffusion, these measurements yield an
independent method for determining the coefficient of turbulent diffusion at

numerical dispersion modelling, and found a regular upward forcing of aerosols

the 2MASS catalogue as a starting point, and the well established correlation
between black hole mass and the bulge of old population of stars, we derive a
list of nearby black hole candidates within the redshift range z < 0.025, then
do a further selection based on the Hubble-type, and give this as a catalogue
elsewhere. The final list of black hole candidates above a mass of M_BH >
3*10^{6} M_sol has 5,829 entries; moreover doing a further Hubble type
correction to account for the selection effects cuts down the number to 2,919
black hole candidates. We also correct for volume, so that this mass function
is a volume limited distribution to redshift 0.025 The differential mass
function of nearby black hole candidates is a curved function, with a straight
simple power-law of index -3 above 10^{8} M_sol, growing progressively flatter
towards lower masses, turning off towards a gap below 3*10^{6} M_sol, and then
extending into the range where nuclear star clusters replace black holes. The
shape of this mass function can be explained in a simple merger picture.
Integrating this mass function over the redshift range, from which it has been
derived, gives a total number of black holes with z < 0.025, and M_BH > 10^{7}
M_sol of about 2.4*10^{4}, or, if we just average uniformly, 0.6 for every
square degree on the sky. In different models many of these are candidates for
ultra high energy particles sources. If a very small fraction of the
super-massive black holes produces ultra high energy cosmic rays, this should
be enough to observe the highly inhomogeneous distribution of the galaxies.

results are as follows. Firstly, we show that almost surely the boolean-width
of a random graph on $n$ vertices is $O(\log^2 n)$, and it is easy to find the
corresponding decomposition tree.
  Secondly, for any constant $d$ a graph of maximum degree $d$ has
boolean-width linear in treewidth. This implies that almost surely the
boolean-width of a (sparse) random $d$-regular graph on $n$ vertices is linear
in $n$.
  Thirdly, we show that the boolean-cut value is well approximated by VC
dimension of corresponding set system. Since VC dimension is widely studied, we
hope that this structural result will prove helpful in better understanding of
boolean-width.
  Combining our first structural result with algorithms from Bui-Xuan et al

generation and propagation of waves along a body. As a mode of locomotion it is
primitive and relatively simple, yet can be remarkably robust. No wonder then,
that it is so prevalent across a range of biological scales from motile
bacteria to gigantic prehistoric snakes. Key to understanding undulatory
locomotion is the body's interplay with the physical environment, which the
swimmer or crawler will exploit to generate propulsion, and in some cases, even
to generate the underlying undulations. This review focuses by and large on
undulators in the low Reynolds numbers regime, where the physics of the
environment can be much more tractable. We review some key concepts and
theoretical advances, as well as simulation tools and results applied to
selected examples of biological swimmers. In particular, we extend the
discussion to some simple cases of locomotion in non-Newtonian media as well as
to small animals, in which the nervous system, motor control, body properties
and the environment must all be considered to understand how undulations are
generated and modulated. To conclude, we review recent progress in microrobotic
undulators that may one day become commonplace in applications ranging from
toxic waste disposal to minimally invasive surgery.

Magnetohydrodynamic plasma are investigated by means of time dependent three
dimensional Hall MHD simulations. Our simulations, in agreement with spacecraft

length-scales associated with electromagnetic fluctuations that are smaller
than the ion gyroradius. In this regime, our 3D simulations show that turbulent
spectral cascades in the presence of a mean magnetic field follow an
omnidirectional anisotropic inertial range spectrum close to $k^{-7/3}$. The
onset of the spectral break in our simulations can be ascribed to the presence
of nonlinear Hall interactions that modify the spectral cascades. Our
simulations further show that the underlying charachteristic turbulent
fluctuations are spectrally anisotropic, the extent of which depends critically
on the local wavenumber. The fluctuations associated with length scales smaller
than the ion gyroradius are highly compressible and tend to exhibit a near
equipartition in the velocity and magnetic fields. Finally, we find that the
orientation of velocity and magnetic field fluctuations critically determine
the character of nonlinear interactions that predominantly govern a Hall MHD
plasma, like the solar wind.

explore how the propensity for this type of long distance dispersal influences
long term population persistence in a heterogeneous landscape where
catastrophic mortality events are common. Analysis of this model indicates that
although some dispersal does indeed decrease the probability of extinction of
the population, the frequency of dispersal is only important in certain
extremes. Instead, both the mean population birth and death rates, and the
landscape composition, are much more important in determining the probability
of extinction than the dispersal process. Thus, in order to develop effective
conservation strategies for these spiders, better understanding of life history
processes should be prioritized over an understanding of dispersal strategies.
