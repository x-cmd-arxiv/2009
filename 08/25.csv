spin-dependent interactions. Interactions which carry additional powers of the
momentum transfer, q^2, are assumed to be too small to be relevant. In theories
with new particles at the ~ GeV scale, however, these q^2-dependent
interactions can be large, and, in some cases dominate over the standard
interactions. This leads to new phenomenology in direct detection experiments.
Recoil spectra peak at non-zero energies, and the relative strengths of
different experiments can be significantly altered. We present a simple
parameterization for models of this type which captures much of the interesting
phenomenology and allows a comparison between experiments. As an application,
we find that dark matter with momentum dependent interactions coupling to the
spin of the proton can reconcile the DAMA annual modulation result with other
experiments.

gleaned from the comparison of the X-ray and the weak lensing mass maps of
galaxy clusters. We do this by investigating the 2D substructure within three
high-resolution cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters. Our main results
focus on non-radiative gas dynamics, but we also consider the effects of
radiative cooling at high redshift. For our analysis, we use a novel approach,
based on unsharp-masking, to identify substructures in 2D surface mass density
and X-ray surface brightness maps. At full resolution (~ 15 h^-1 kpc), this
technique is capable of identifying almost all self-bound dark matter subhaloes
with M>10^12 h^-1 M_sun. We also report a correlation between the mass of a
subhalo and the area of its corresponding 2D detection; such a correlation,
once calibrated, could provide a useful estimator for substructure mass.
Comparing our 2D mass and X-ray substructures, we find a surprising number of
cases where the matching fails: around one third of galaxy-sized substructures
have no X-ray counterpart. Some interesting cases are also found at larger
masses, in particular the cores of merging clusters where the situation can be
complex. Finally, we degrade our mass maps to what is currently achievable with
weak-lensing observations (~100 h^-1 kpc at z=0.2). While the completeness mass
limit increases by around an order of magnitude, a mass-area correlation
remains. Our paper clearly demonstrates that the next generation of lensing
surveys should start to reveal a wealth of information on cluster substructure.

described as a small black hole that has zero entropy in the supergravity
approximation, but classical higher derivative corrections produce a finite
entropy in accordance with the prediction of microstate counting. On the other
hand for the same system one can construct smooth horizonless classical
solutions whose geometric quantization describes the individual microstates
which contribute to the entropy. In this note we point out that there is no
duality frame in which the system admits both these classical descriptions.
Thus in a given duality frame horizonless classical solutions and small black
holes are not alternate descriptions of the same system; their contributions
must be added to get a duality invariant result for the macroscopic degeneracy.
We discuss the significance of this observation for the macroscopic computation
of the degeneracy of BPS states for a general system. We also discuss the
relationship between the degeneracy and the index computation and address the
puzzle regarding absence of small black holes in toroidally compactified type

Temporal Difference Learning (LSTD). We demonstrate that LSTD is equivalent to
the MVU if the Markov Reward Process (MRP) is acyclic and show that both differ
for most cyclic MRPs as LSTD is then typically biased. More generally, we show
that estimators that fulfill the Bellman equation can only be unbiased for
special cyclic MRPs. The main reason being the probability measures with which
the expectations are taken. These measure vary from state to state and due to
the strong coupling by the Bellman equation it is typically not possible for a
set of value estimators to be unbiased with respect to each of these measures.
Furthermore, we derive relations of the MVU to MC and TD. The most important
one being the equivalence of MC to the MVU and to LSTD for undiscounted MRPs in
which MC has the same amount of information. In the discounted case this
equivalence does not hold anymore. For TD we show that it is essentially
unbiased for acyclic MRPs and biased for cyclic MRPs. We also order estimators
according to their risk and present counter-examples to show that no general
ordering exists between the MVU and LSTD, between MC and LSTD and between TD

evaluation.

multiple integral realization of the conformal blocks and explicitly compute
amplitudes involving operators with quantized values of the sum of their spins,
i.e., requiring an integer number of screening charges of the first kind. The
result is given as a sum over the independent configurations of screening
contours yielding a monodromy invariant expansion in powers of the worldsheet
moduli. We then examine the factorization limit and show that the leading terms
in the sum can be identified, in the semiclassical limit, with products of
spectral flow conserving three-point functions. These terms can be rewritten as
the m-basis version of the integral expression obtained by J. Teschner from a
postulate for the operator product expansion of normalizable states in the
H3+-WZNW model. Finally, we determine the equivalence between the
factorizations of a particular set of four-point functions into products of two
three-point functions either preserving or violating spectral flow number
conservation. Based on this analysis we argue that the expression for the
amplitude as an integral over the spin of the intermediate operators holds
beyond the semiclassical regime, thus corroborating that spectral flow
conserving correlators in the AdS3-WZNW model are related by analytic
continuation to correlation functions in the H3+-WZNW model.

In order to obtain as precise RVs as possible, most of the systems were
observed with an iodine cell available at the AAT/UCLES and/or analyzed using
the two-dimensional cross-correlation technique (TODCOR). The RVs were measured
with TODCOR using synthetic template spectra as references. However, for two
objects we used our own approach to the tomographic disentangling of the binary
spectra to provide observed template spectra for the RV measurements and to
improve the RV precision even more. For one of these binaries, AI Phe, we were
able to the obtain an orbital solution with an RV $rms$ of 62 and 24 m s$^{-1}$
for the primary and secondary respectively. For this system, the precision in
$M \sin^3{i}$ is 0.08%. For the analysis, we used the photometry available in
the ASAS database. We combined the RV and light curves using PHOEBE and JKTEBOP
codes to obtain the absolute physical parameters of the systems. Having precise
RVs we were able to reach $\sim$0.2 % precision (or better) in masses in
several cases but in radii, due to the limited precision of the ASAS
photometry, we were able to reach a precision of only 1% in one case and 3-5 %
in a few more cases. For the majority of our objects, the orbital and physical

shock is followed from its launch by neutrino heating until it breaks out from
the stellar surface more than two hours after the core collapse. Violent
convective overturn in the post-shock layer causes the explosion to start with
significant asphericity, which triggers the growth of Rayleigh-Taylor (RT)
instabilities at the composition interfaces of the exploding star. Deep inward
mixing of hydrogen (H) is found as well as fast-moving, metal-rich clumps
penetrating with high velocities far into the H-envelope of the star as
observed, e.g., in the case of SN 1987A. Also individual clumps containing a
sizeable fraction of the ejected iron-group elements (up to several 0.001 solar
masses) are obtained in some models. The metal core of the progenitor is
partially turned over with Ni-dominated fingers overtaking oxygen-rich bullets
and both Ni and O moving well ahead of the material from the carbon layer.
Comparing with corresponding 2D (axially symmetric) calculations, we determine
the growth of the RT fingers to be faster, the deceleration of the dense
metal-carrying clumps in the He and H layers to be reduced, the asymptotic
clump velocities in the H-shell to be higher (up to ~4500 km/s for the
considered progenitor and an explosion energy of 10^{51} ergs, instead of <2000
km/s in 2D), and the outward radial mixing of heavy elements and inward mixing
of hydrogen to be more efficient in 3D than in 2D. We present a simple argument

  The infrared emission in Cyngus A shows contributions from all three

almost 5 dex in frequency. The bolometric AGN luminosity is found to be ~10^45

contours for colliding galaxy clusters such as, for instance, the famous

baryonic and (dominant) gravitational matter component of order ~(100-200) kpc.
Such discrepancies are difficult to explain using modified theories for gravity
other than dark matter. Or are they not? Here we use the concept of ""phantom
dark matter"" that is based upon a Newtonian interpretation of the MONDian
gravitational potential. We show that this idea is in fact capable of producing
substantial offsets in idealistic density configurations, involving a uniform
external field. However, when analysed in a MONDian cosmological framework we
deduce that the size (and probablity) of the effect is too small to explain the
observed offsets found in the most recent observations, at least in the
simplest incarnation of phantom dark matter as discussed here. The lensing
centers in merging galaxy clusters are likely very close to the centers of true
mass even in a MONDian cosmology. This gives the support to the idea that
neutrino-like non-collisional matter might be responsible for the observed
offsets of lensing and X-ray peaks.

Stromgren photometry and multi-fibre spectroscopy are combined to provide
information about the evolutionary state of the stars (via the Stromgren c_1

a clean sample of red giant branch stars, and show that foreground
contamination by Milky Way dwarf stars can greatly distort the results. Our
final sample consists of 28 red giant branch stars in the Hercules dSph galaxy.

interesting spectral features in the positron to total electron ratio and in
the total electronic component of cosmic rays at high energy. These
observations are studied with analytical models for the propagation of cosmic
rays emanating from a discrete set of sources or from a smooth distribution of
sources extending over the Galaxy. The contrast between the theoretically
expected spectra from these two source distributions is seen to play a crucial
role in the interpretation of the recent findings. It is shown that the
positron to electron ratio, observed by PAMELA, may be fit over the entire
energy range in the nested leaky-box model for cosmic ray propagation and that
the ratio is expected to reach an asymptotic value of $\sim0.6$ at high
energies in all conventional models of cosmic ray propagation. We also derive
the spectral shape of the electrons and positrons expected from the
annihilation of dark matter in the Galaxy and show that the spectral shape of
the peak will provide important information, not only regarding the mass of the
dark matter particles, but also regarding their spatial distribution. The
spectrum of secondary positrons and electrons, calculated with the nested
leaky-box model, is subtracted from the spectrum of the electronic component to
determine the spectrum of primary electrons emerging from the cosmic ray
sources. This spectrum is analyzed in terms of contributions from a set of
discrete sources sprinkled across the Galactic volume. Our analysis suggests
the possible presence of electrons, accelerated in high Mach number shocks, in
the cosmic rays.

Observational data suggest that a wide variety of behaviors may spread in human

with similar behaviors, posing difficulty for causal inference. Here, we
exploit a seminal set of laboratory experiments that originally showed that
voluntary costly punishment can help sustain cooperation. In these experiments,
subjects were randomly assigned to a sequence of different groups in order to
play a series of single-shot public goods games with strangers; this feature
allowed us to draw networks of interactions to explore how cooperative and
uncooperative behavior spreads from person to person to person. We show that,
in both an ordinary public goods game and in a public goods game with
punishment, focal individuals are influenced by fellow group members'
contribution behavior in future interactions with other individuals who were
not a party to the initial interaction. Furthermore, this influence persists
for multiple periods and spreads up to three degrees of separation (from person
to person to person to person). The results suggest that each additional
contribution a subject makes to the public good in the first period is tripled
over the course of the experiment by other subjects who are directly or
indirectly influenced to contribute more as a consequence. These are the first
results to show experimentally that cooperative behavior cascades in human
social networks.

increased again in the recent past, especially in the bar and the wing of the

out the basic physics, we consider the simplest possible model of a symmetric
binary electrolyte confined between parallel-plate blocking electrodes,
ignoring any transverse instability or fluid flow. We analyze the resulting
one-dimensional problem by matched asymptotic expansions in the limit of thin
double layers and extend previous work into the strongly nonlinear regime,
which is characterized by two novel features - significant salt depletion in
the electrolyte near the electrodes and, at very large voltage, the breakdown
of the quasi-equilibrium structure of the double layers. The former leads to
the prediction of ""ac capacitive desalination"", since there is a time-averaged
transfer of salt from the bulk to the double layers, via oscillating diffusion
layers. The latter is associated with transient diffusion limitation, which
drives the formation and collapse of space-charge layers, even in the absence
of any net Faradaic current through the cell. We also predict that steric
effects of finite ion sizes (going beyond dilute solution theory) act to
suppress the strongly nonlinear regime in the limit of concentrated
electrolytes, ionic liquids and molten salts. Beyond the model problem, our
reduced equations for thin double layers, based on uniformly valid matched
asymptotic expansions, provide a useful mathematical framework to describe
additional nonlinear responses to large ac voltages, such as Faradaic
reactions, electro-osmotic instabilities, and induced-charge electrokinetic
phenomena.

  latest revised version. Version 1 was published in Allerton Conference 2009.
  Version 2 contains extensions to the rate-distortion theory and an achievable
  proof of the sum-rate R* in the second example",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A two-terminal interactive function computation problem with alternating
messages is studied within the framework of distributed block source coding
theory. For any finite number of messages, a single-letter characterization of
the sum-rate-distortion function was established in previous works using
standard information-theoretic techniques. This, however, does not provide a
satisfactory characterization of the infinite-message limit, which is a new,
unexplored dimension for asymptotic-analysis in distributed block source coding
involving potentially an infinite number of infinitesimal-rate messages. In
this paper, the infinite-message sum-rate-distortion function, viewed as a
functional of the joint source pmf and the distortion levels, is characterized
as the least element of a partially ordered family of functionals having
certain convex-geometric properties. The new characterization does not involve
evaluating the infinite-message limit of a finite-message sum-rate-distortion
expression. This characterization leads to a family of lower bounds for the
infinite-message sum-rate-distortion expression and a simple criterion to test
the optimality of any achievable infinite-message sum-rate-distortion
expression. For computing the amplewise Boolean AND function, the
infinite-message minimum sum-rates are characterized in closed analytic form.
These sum-rates are shown to be achievable using infinitely many
infinitesimal-rate messages. The new convex-geometric characterization is used
to develop an iterative algorithm for evaluating any finite-message
sumrate-distortion function. It is also used to construct the first examples
which demonstrate that for lossy source reproduction, two messages can strictly
improve the one-message Wyner-Ziv rate-distortion function settling an
unresolved question from a 1985 paper.

electrodynamic properties are described not by the conventional Maxwell
equations but rather by an attached axion field, originally proposed to
describe strongly interacting particles. It has been proposed that a
topological insulator with a single spin-textured Dirac cone interfaced with a
superconductor can form the most elementary unit for performing fault-tolerant
quantum computation. Here we present an angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy study and first-principle theoretical calculation-predictions that
reveal the first observation of such a topological state of matter featuring a
single-surface-Dirac-cone realized in the naturally occurring Bi$_2$Se$_3$

calculations, demonstrate that undoped compound of this class of materials can
serve as the parent matrix compound for the long-sought topological device

topological origin. Our study further suggests that the undoped compound
reached via n-to-p doping should show topological transport phenomena even at

  Peterson varieties","31 pages",,"10.1112/plms/pdq038",,"math.AG math.AT math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Peterson varieties are a special class of Hessenberg varieties that have been
extensively studied e.g. by Peterson, Kostant, and Rietsch, in connection with
the quantum cohomology of the flag variety. In this manuscript, we develop a
generalized Schubert calculus, and in particular a positive Chevalley-Monk
formula, for the ordinary and Borel-equivariant cohomology of the Peterson
variety $Y$ in type $A_{n-1}$, with respect to a natural $S^1$-action arising
from the standard action of the maximal torus on flag varieties. As far as we
know, this is the first example of positive Schubert calculus beyond the realm
of Kac-Moody flag varieties $G/P$.
  Our main results are as follows. First, we identify a computationally
convenient basis of $H^*_{S^1}(Y)$, which we call the basis of Peterson
Schubert classes. Second, we derive a manifestly positive, integral
Chevalley-Monk formula for the product of a cohomology-degree-2 Peterson
Schubert class with an arbitrary Peterson Schubert class. Both $H^*_{S^1}(Y)$
and $H^*(Y)$ are generated in degree 2. Finally, by using our Chevalley-Monk
formula we give explicit descriptions (via generators and relations) of both
the $S^1$-equivariant cohomology ring $H^*_{S^1}(Y)$ and the ordinary
cohomology ring $H^*(Y)$ of the type $A_{n-1}$ Peterson variety. Our methods
are both directly from and inspired by those of GKM
(Goresky-Kottwitz-MacPherson) theory and classical Schubert calculus. We
discuss several open questions and directions for future work.

Binaries with periods of a few days possess the highest degree of coronal X-ray
activity among regular, non-relativistic stars because of their fast, tidally
driven rotation. But the orbital periods in visual double stars are too large
for any direct interaction between the companions to take place. We suggest
that most of the strongest X-ray components in resolved binaries are
yet-undiscovered short-period binaries, and that a few are merged remnants of
such binaries. The omnipresence of short-period active stars, e.g. of
BY-Dra-type binaries, in multiple systems is explained via the dynamical
evolution of triple stars with large mutual inclinations. The dynamical
perturbation on the inner pair pumps up the eccentricity in a cyclic manner, a
phenomenon known as Kozai cycling. At times of close periapsis, tidal friction
reduces the angular momentum of the binary, causing it to shrink. When the
orbital period of the inner pair drops to a few days, fast surface rotation of
the companions is driven by tidal forces, boosting activity by a few orders of
magnitude. If the period drops still further, a merger may take place leaving a
rapidly-rotating active dwarf with only a distant companion.

stray-photon noise along the propagation, as well as amplitude attenuation. An
explicit analytical expression for the density matrix as a function of

generated randomly, the decay of coherence is very different; in fact no worse
than the classical Beer-Lambert law. More surprisingly, there is a plateu at a
mid-range interval in propagation distance where the loss is in fact
sub-classical, following which it resumes the classical rate. The qualitative
behavior of the decay of entanglement for two-mode propagation is also analyzed
numerically for ensembles of random states using the behavior of negativity as

large number of colors $N$ and $N_f\ll N$ at $T\neq 0$ and $\mu\neq 0$ is
triggered by the drastic change in $\theta$ behavior. The conjecture is
motivated by the holographic model of QCD where confinement -deconfinement
phase transition indeed happens precisely at $T=T_c$ where $\theta$ dependence
experiences a sudden change in behavior. The conjecture is also supported by
quantum field theory arguments when the instanton calculations (which trigger
the $\theta$ dependence) are under complete theoretical control for $T>T_c$,
suddenly break down immediately below $T<T_c$ with sharp changes in the
$\theta$ dependence. Finally, the conjecture is supported by a number of
numerical lattice results. We employ this conjecture to study confinement
-deconfinement phase transition of hot and dense QCD in large $N$ limit by
analyzing the $\theta$ dependence. We estimate the critical values for $T_c$
and $\mu_c$ where the phase transition happens by approaching the critical
values from the hot and/or dense regions where the instanton calculations are
under complete theoretical control. We also describe some defects of various

planetesimal formation. If the density of a dust layer becomes sufficiently
high as a result of the sedimentation of dust grains toward the midplane of a
protoplanetary disk, the layer becomes gravitationally unstable and
spontaneously fragments into planetesimals. Using a shearing box method, we
performed local $N$-body simulations of gravitational instability of a dust
layer and subsequent coagulation without gas and investigated the basic
formation process of planetesimals. In this paper, we adopted the accretion
model as a collision model. A gravitationally bound pair of particles is
replaced by a single particle with the total mass of the pair. This accretion
model enables us to perform long-term and large-scale calculations. We
confirmed that the formation process of planetesimals is the same as that in
the previous paper with the rubble pile models. The formation process is
divided into three stages: the formation of non-axisymmetric structures, the
creation of planetesimal seeds, and their collisional growth. We investigated
the dependence of the planetesimal mass on the simulation domain size. We found
that the mean mass of planetesimals formed in simulations is proportional to
$L_y^{3/2}$, where $L_y$ is the size of the computational domain in the
direction of rotation. However, the mean mass of planetesimals is independent
of $L_x$, where $L_x$ is the size of the computational domain in the radial
direction if $L_x$ is sufficiently large. We presented the estimation formula
of the planetesimal mass taking into account the simulation domain size.

smooth Gaussian field as a prior for a multidimensional function. The rescaling
is achieved using a Gamma variable and the procedure can be viewed as choosing
an inverse Gamma bandwidth. The procedure is studied from a frequentist
perspective in three statistical settings involving replicated observations
(density estimation, regression and classification). We prove that the
resulting posterior distribution shrinks to the distribution that generates the
data at a speed which is minimax-optimal up to a logarithmic factor, whatever
the regularity level of the data-generating distribution. Thus the hierachical
Bayesian procedure, with a fixed prior, is shown to be fully adaptive.

ideas and dramatic achievements in both fundamentals and applications. The
spaser has been predicted and observed experimentally as an active element --
generator of coherent local fields. Even greater progress will be achieved if
the spaser could function as a ultrafast nanoamplifier -- an optical
counterpart of the MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor).
A formidable problem with this is that the spaser has the inherent feedback
causing quantum generation of nanolocalized surface plasmons and saturation and
consequent elimination of the net gain, making it unsuitable for amplification.
We have overcome this inherent problem and shown that the spaser can perform
functions of an ultrafast nanoamplifier in two modes: transient and bistable.
On the basis of quantum density matrix (optical Bloch) equations we have shown
that the spaser amplifies with gain greater than 50, the switching time less or
on the order of 100 fs (potentially, 10 fs). This prospective spaser technology
will further broaden both fundamental and applied horizons of nanoscience, in
particular, enabling ultrafast microprocessors working at 10 to 100 THz clock
speed. Other prospective applications are in ultrasensing, ultradense and
ultrafast information storage, and biomedicine. The spasers are based on metals
and, in contrast to semiconductors, are highly resistive to ionizing radiation,
high temperatures, microwave radiation, and other adverse environments.

Galactic Cepheids based on multi-colour photometric and radial velocity data.
Reliable P-A graphs for Galactic Cepheids constructed for the U, B, V, R_C, and
I_C photometric bands and pulsational radial velocity variations facilitate
investigations of previously poorly studied interrelations between observable
amplitudes. The effects of both binarity and metallicity on the observed
amplitude, and the dichotomy between short- and long-period Cepheids can both
be studied. Results: Large amplitude Cepheids with companions exhibit smaller
photometric amplitudes on average than solitary ones, as expected, while
s-Cepheids pulsate with an rbitrary (although small) amplitude. The ratio of
the observed radial velocity to blue photometric amplitudes, A_V_RAD/A_B, is
not as good an indicator of the ulsation mode as predicted theoretically. This
may be caused by an incorrect mode assignment to a number of small amplitude
Cepheids, which are not ecessarily first overtone pulsators. The dependence of
the pulsation amplitudes on wavelength is used to identify duplicity of
Cepheids. More than twenty stars previously classified as solitary Cepheids are
now suspected to have a companion. The ratio of photometric amplitudes observed
in various bands confirms the existence of a dichotomy among normal amplitude
Cepheids. The limiting period separating short- and long-period Cepheids is
10.47 days. Conclusions: Interdependences of pulsational amplitudes, the period
dependence of the amplitude parameters, and the dichotomy have to be taken into
account as constraints in modelling the structure and pulsation of Cepheids.
Studies of the P-L relationship must comply with the break at 10.47 instead of
the currently used `convenient' value of 10 days.

red sequence (i.e., the transition region) by combining UV and NIR imaging to
HI line observations for a volume-limited sample of nearby galaxies. We confirm
the existence of a tight relation between colour and HI-fraction across all the
range of colours, although outside the blue cloud this trend becomes gradually
weaker. Transition galaxies are divided into two different families, according
to their atomic hydrogen content. HI-deficient galaxies are the majority of
transition galaxies in our sample. They are found in high density environments
and all their properties are consistent with a quenching of the star formation
via gas stripping. However, while the migration from the blue cloud is
relatively quick (i.e., <=1 Gyr), a longer amount of time (a few Gyr at least)
seems required to completely suppress the star formation and reach the red
sequence. At all masses, migrating HI-deficient galaxies are mainly disks,
implying that the mechanism responsible for today's migration in clusters
cannot have played a significant role in the creation of the red sequence at
high-redshift. Conversely, HI-normal transition galaxies are a more
heterogeneous population. A fraction of these objects show evidence for
accretion/minor-merging events suggesting that at least part of the HI
reservoir has an external origin. The detailed evolution of such systems is
still unclear, but our analysis suggests that some galaxies might have migrated
back from the red sequence after accretion events. Our study clearly shows the
variety of evolutionary paths leading to the transition region and suggests
that the transition galaxies may not be always associated with systems quickly
migrating from the blue to the red sequence.

emission signature of the IGM against the background CMB during the Epoch of
Reionisation is examined. It is shown that, taking into account the diminishing
resonance line scattering cross section with increasing Lyman order, a
non-negligible net scattering rate of higher order Lyman photons is expected.
The resulting radiative cascades will substantially enhance the number density
of Lyman-alpha photons near a radiation source. It is also shown that the
higher order Lyman series photons are able to collisionally heat the IGM by
amounts of tens to hundreds of degrees kelvin. The possibility that the
Wouthuysen-Field effect may be suppressed by the presence of dust near a galaxy
is discussed, and it is shown that the higher order Lyman series photons would
still induce the effect, but with a somewhat reduced 21cm radiation efficiency.
It is also demonstrated that extended low surface brightness emission line
halos will be produced from radiative cascades following the scattering of
higher order Lyman series photons. These halos would provide a unique means of
confirming that reionisation source candidates were surrounded by an IGM that
was still largely neutral on large scales.

that, when the 16-supercodon table is populated with 10 putative primordial
amino acids, inferred from the results of abiotic synthesis experiments and
other evidence independent of the code evolution, and with minimal assumptions
used to assign the remaining supercodons, the resulting 2-letter codes are
nearly optimal in terms of the error minimization level. The results of the
computational experiments with putative primordial genetic codes that contained
only two meaningful letters in all codons and encoded 10 to 16 amino acids
indicate that such codes are likely to have been nearly optimal with respect to
the minimization of translation errors. This near-optimality could be the
outcome of extensive early selection during the co-evolution of the code with
the primordial, error-prone translation system, or a result of a unique,
accidental event. Under this hypothesis, the subsequent expansion of the code
resulted in a decrease of the error minimization level that became sustainable

star-formation is a debated topic. In particular, it is still unclear how
magnetic fields influence the formation and dynamic of disks and outflows. Most
current information on magnetic fields close to high-mass protostars comes from
H2O and OH maser observations. Recently, the first 6.7 GHz methanol maser
polarization observations were made, and they reveal strong and ordered
magnetic fields. The morphology of the magnetic field during high-mass
star-formation needs to be investigated on small scales, which can only be done
using very long baseline interferometry observations. The massive star-forming
regionW75N contains three radio sources and associated masers, while a
large-scale molecular bipolar outflow is also present. Polarization
observations of the 6.7 GHz methanol masers at high angular resolution probe
the strength and structure of the magnetic field and determine its relation to
the outflow. Eight of the European VLBI network antennas were used to measure
the linear polarization and Zeeman-splitting of the 6.7 GHz methanol masers in
the star-forming region W75N. We detected 10 methanol maser features, 4 of
which were undetected in previous work. All arise near the source VLA1 of W75N.
The linear polarization of the masers reveals a tightly ordered magnetic field
over more than 2000 AU around VLA1 that is exactly aligned with the large-scale
molecular outflow. This is consistent with the twisted magnetic field model
proposed for explaining dust polarization observations. The Zeeman-splitting
measured on 3 of the maser features indicates a dynamically important magnetic
field in the maser region of the order of 50mG. We suggest VLA1 is the powering
sources of the bipolar outflow.

high kinetic temperature (100-150 K) gas occurs in all galaxies, except perhaps
NGC 3628, and is mixed with cooler (10-30 K) and denser (3000-10000 cm-3) gas.

of magnitude smaller than the `standard' value for the Solar Neighborhood. The

for the first time the high density center of the main core in the complex,
that is associated with the formation of a small cluster of stars. We found
that the central core in Barnard 59 shows an unexpected lack of significant
substructure consisting of only two significant fragments. Overall, the
material appears to be consistent with being a single, large core with a
density profile that can be well fit by a King model. A series of NH$_3$
pointed observations towards the high column density center of the core appear
to show that the core is still thermally dominated, with sub-sonic non-thermal
motions. The stars in the cluster could be providing feedback to support the
core against collapse, but the relatively narrow radio lines suggest that an
additional source of support, for example a magnetic field, may be required to
stabilize the core. Outside the central core our observations reveal the
structure of peripheral cores and resolve an extended filament into a handful
of significant substructures whose spacing and masses appear to be consistent
with Jeans fragmentation.

$G^*_{\gamma}=\{x:f(x)\geq\gamma\}$ of an unknown $d$-dimensional density
function $f$ based on $n$ independent observations $X_1,...,X_n$ from the
density. This problem has been addressed under global error criteria related to
the symmetric set difference. However, in certain applications a spatially
uniform mode of convergence is desirable to ensure that the estimated set is
close to the target set everywhere. The Hausdorff error criterion provides this
degree of uniformity and, hence, is more appropriate in such situations. It is
known that the minimax optimal rate of error convergence for the Hausdorff
metric is $(n/\log n)^{-1/(d+2\alpha)}$ for level sets with boundaries that
have a Lipschitz functional form, where the parameter $\alpha$ characterizes
the regularity of the density around the level of interest. However, the
estimators proposed in previous work are nonadaptive to the density regularity
and require knowledge of the parameter $\alpha$. Furthermore, previously
developed estimators achieve the minimax optimal rate for rather restricted
classes of sets (e.g., the boundary fragment and star-shaped sets) that
effectively reduce the set estimation problem to a function estimation problem.
This characterization precludes level sets with multiple connected components,
which are fundamental to many applications. This paper presents a fully
data-driven procedure that is adaptive to unknown regularity conditions and
achieves near minimax optimal Hausdorff error control for a class of density
level sets with very general shapes and multiple connected components.

in a data-driven way one estimate out of a given class of estimates ordered by
their variability. A serious problem with using this and similar procedures is
the choice of some tuning parameters like thresholds. Numerical results show
that the theoretically recommended proposals appear to be too conservative and
lead to a strong oversmoothing effect. A careful choice of the parameters of
the procedure is extremely important for getting the reasonable quality of
estimation. The main contribution of this paper is the new approach for
choosing the parameters of the procedure by providing the prescribed behavior
of the resulting estimate in the simple parametric situation. We establish a
non-asymptotical ""oracle"" bound, which shows that the estimation risk is, up to
a logarithmic multiplier, equal to the risk of the ""oracle"" estimate that is
optimally selected from the given family. A numerical study demonstrates a good
performance of the resulting procedure in a number of simulated examples.

consequence for older objects are low abundances of heavy elements, which
results in a wide distribution of objects over metallicity, hence over age.
Within their cool atmosphere, dust clouds become a dominant feature, affecting
the opacity and the remaining gas phase abundance of heavy elements. We
investigate the influence of the stellar metallicity on the dust formation in
substellar atmospheres and on the dust cloud structure and its feedback on the
atmosphere. We utilize numerical simulations in which we solve a set of moment
equations in order to determine the quasi-static dust cloud structure (DRIFT).
These equations model the nucleation, the kinetic growth of composite
particles, their evaporation and the gravitational settling as a stationary
dust formation process. Element conservation equations augment this system of
equations including the element replenishment by convective overshooting. The
integration with an atmosphere code (PHOENIX) allows to determine a consistent
(T, p, v_conv)-structure, and, hence, also to calculate synthetic spectra. A
grid of DRIFT-PHOENIX model atmospheres was calculated for a wide range of
metallicity to allow for a systematic study of atmospheric cloud structures
throughout the evolution of the universe. We find dust clouds in even the most
metal-poor ([M/H]=-6.0) atmosphere of brown dwarfs. Only the most massive among
the youngest brown dwarfs and giant gas planets can resist dust formation. For
very low heavy element abundances, a temperature inversion develops which has a
drastic impact on the dust cloud structure. We further show that the
dust-to-gas ratio does not scale linearly with the object's [M/H] for a given
effective temperature.

obtained at the 8m VLT UT2-Kueyen telescope with the FLAMES+GIRAFFE

temperatures as reference values. Spectroscopic parameters are derived from FeI
and FeII lines, and adopted for the derivation of abundance ratios. The present
analysis provides a metallicity [Fe/H] = -1.0+-0.2. The alpha-elements Oxygen,
Magnesium and Silicon show [O/Fe]=+0.4, [Mg/Fe]=[Si/Fe]= +0.25, whereas Calcium
and Titanium show shallower ratios of [Ca/Fe]=[Ti/Fe]=+0.15. The
neutron-capture r-process element Europium appears to be overabundant by
[Eu/Fe]=+0.4. The neutron-capture s-elements La and Ba are enhanced by
[La/Fe]=+0.35 and [Ba/Fe]=+0.5. The large internal errors, indicating the large
star-to-star variationin the Ba and Eu abundances, are also discussed. The
moderate metallicity combined to a blue Horizontal Branch (BHB), are
characteristics similar to those of HP~1 and NGC 6558, pointing to a population
of very old globular clusters in the Galactic bulge. Also, the abundance ratios

that the bulge is old, and went through an early prompt chemical enrichment.

at least from the point of view of the behaviour in the hardness-intensity

taken into account. Although based on a very small number of observations, a
radio/X-ray correlation seems to exist for this system, with a slope of
alpha=0.40 +/- 0.07 (F_{radio} \propto F_{X}^{alpha}), which is different than
the slope of alpha=1.40 +/- 0.25 found for another atoll source, 4U 1728-34,

black hole X-ray binaries. No significant correlation is found between the
radio and optical (R band) emissions. We also report a significant drop in the
radio flux from Aql X-1 above an X-ray flux of ~ 5 X 10^{-9} erg cm^{-2}

dimensionality diversities, as well as the potential unstable volumes of
magnetic discontinuities above the studied ARs. Correlations of these
quantities with the flare index, which provides information about the flare

the potential unstable volume of magnetic discontinuities in the corona is
observed before the phases characterized by more frequent and intense flares.

defects of different winding numbers have been obtained, beyond the known

field orients out of the basal plane in some cases, maintaining a close to

convenient inclusion of coherences and Lamb shift in counting statistics. As a
Markovian example with Lindblad-type density matrices, we consider the
Born-Markov-Secular (BMS) approximation which is a special case of the
non-Markovian dynamical coarse graining (DCG) approach. For illustration we
consider transport through two interacting levels that are either serially or
parallelly coupled to two leads held at different chemical potentials. It is
shown that the coherences can strongly influence the (frequency-dependent)
transport cumulants: In the serial case the neglect of coherences would lead to
unphysical currents through disconnected conductors. Interference effects in
the parallel setup can cause strong current suppression with giant Fano factors
and telegraph-like distribution functions of transferred electrons, which is
not found without coherences. We demonstrate that with finite coarse graining
times coherences are automatically included and, consequently, the shortcomings
of the BMS approximation are resolved.

five times more extended than listed in NED. The faint extensions of the galaxy
