explain the most fundamental property of superconductors, the Meissner effect:
how is the Meissner current generated, and how is it able to defy Faraday's
law? How is its mechanical angular momentum compensated? I propose that
superconductivity is impossible unless the metal expels charge from its
interior towards the surface in the transition to superconductivity. As a
consequence, superconductors in their ground state are predicted to possess a
macroscopic electric field in their interior, as well as excess negative charge
and a macroscopic spin current near the surface. The system is driven normal
when the applied magnetic field is strong enough to bring the spin current to a
stop. High temperature superconductivity occurs in systems that have too much
negative charge.

provides first order equations for the radial problem, governs the mass and

to a sextic polynomial in $W^2$ whose coefficients are SU(8) invariant

The aim of this survey is to investigate the dependence of planet formation on
the mass of the host star by searching for planetary companions around
intermediate-mass giants. An iodine absorption cell was used to obtain accurate
RVs for this study. Our measurements reveal that the RVs of 11 UMi show a
periodic variation of 516.22 days. The RV curve of HD 32518 shows sinusoidal
variations with a period of 157.54 days. The HIPPARCOS photometry as well as
our H\alpha core flux measurements reveal no variability with the RV period.
Thus, Keplerian motion is the most likely explanation for the observed RV
variations for both giant stars. An exoplanet with a minimum mass of 10.5

over C, the connecting morphism in periodic cyclic homology is compatible,
under the Chern-Connes character, with the index morphism in lower algebraic
K-theory. The proof relies on the abstract properties of cyclic theory,
essentially excision, which does not provide explicit formulas a priori.
Avoiding the use of excision, we explain in this article how to get explicit
formulas in a wide range of situations. The method is connected to the
renormalization procedure introduced in our previous work on the bivariant
Chern character for quasihomomorphisms, leading to ""local"" index formulas in
the sense of non-commutative geometry. We illustrate these principles with the
example of the classical family index theorem: we find that the characteristic

pseudodifferential operators are expressed in terms of the (fiberwise) Wodzicki

full theory. The spin--1/2, $\Lambda_{Q}$ baryon with $Q=b$ or $c$, is
considered by the most general form of its interpolating current. The time
ordering product of the initial and transition currents is expanded in terms of
the nucleon distribution amplitudes with different twists. Considering two sets
of independent input parameters entering to the nucleon wave functions, namely,
QCD sum rules and Lattice QCD parameters, the related form factors and their
heavy quark effective theory limits are calculated and compared with the
existing predictions of other approaches. It is shown that our results satisfy
the heavy quark symmetry relations for lattice input parameters and b case
exactly and the maximum violation is for charm case and QCD sum rules input
parameters. The obtained form factors are used to compute the transition rates
both in full theory and heavy quark effective theory. A comparison of the
results on decay rate of $\Lambda_{b}\to pl\nu$ with those predicted by other
phenomenological methods or the same method in heavy quark effective theory
with different interpolating current and distribution amplitudes of the
$\Lambda_{b}$ is also presented.

oscillating cross-sections being proportional to the squares of neutrino masses
are practically unobservable in the laboratory; however, they are consistent
with the original Pontecorvo neutrino oscillating transition probability
expression at short time (baseline), as presented by Dvornikov. Then, by
mimicking the time dependence of the original Pontecorvo neutrino oscillating
transition probability, one can formulate the dimensionless neutrino
intensity-probability I, by phenomenological extrapolating the time t, or,
equivalently the baseline distance L away from the collision point for the
oscillating differential cross-section. For the incoming neutrino of 10MeV in
energy and neutrino masses from Fritzsch analysis with the neutrino mixing
matrix of Harrison, Perkins and Scott, the baseline distances at the first two
maxima of the neutrino intensity are L=281km and L=9279km . The intensity I at
the first maximum conserves the flavor, while at the second maximum; the
intensities violate the flavor, respectively, in the final and initial state.
At the end some details are given as to how these neutrino oscillations away

over a shared wireless channel. Due to random fading, the wireless channel
conditions vary with time and from user to user. Each user has a buffer to
store received packets before they are drained. At each time step, the source
determines how much power to use for transmission to each user. The source's
objective is to allocate power in a manner that minimizes an expected cost
measure, while satisfying strict buffer underflow constraints and a total power
constraint in each slot. The expected cost measure is composed of costs
associated with power consumption from transmission and packet holding costs.
The primary application motivating this problem is wireless media streaming.
For this application, the buffer underflow constraints prevent the user buffers
from emptying, so as to maintain playout quality. In the case of a single user
with linear power-rate curves, we show that a modified base-stock policy is
optimal under the finite horizon, infinite horizon discounted, and infinite

sequences of critical numbers that complete the characterization of the optimal
control laws in each of these cases when some additional technical conditions
are satisfied. We then analyze the structure of the optimal policy for the case

impact of individual papers. Using all the papers published in Web of Science
in 2000, we define the degree of interdisciplinarity of a given paper as the
percentage of its cited references made to journals of other disciplines. We
show that, although for all disciplines combined there is no clear correlation
between the level of interdisciplinarity of papers and their citation rates,
there are nonetheless some disciplines in which a higher level of
interdisciplinarity is related to a higher citation rates. For other
disciplines, citations decline as interdisciplinarity grows. One characteristic
is visible in all disciplines: highly disciplinary and highly interdisciplinary
papers have a low scientific impact. This suggests that there might be an
optimum of interdisciplinarity beyond which the research is too dispersed to
find its niche and under which it is too mainstream to have high impact.
Finally, the relationship between interdisciplinarity and scientific impact is
highly determined by the citation characteristics of the disciplines involved:
papers citing citation intensive disciplines are more likely to be cited by
those disciplines and, hence, obtain higher citation scores than papers citing
non citation intensive disciplines.

between deshielded sigma_x ~ sigma_y and shielded sigma_z components (z along
the Ti-O bond); 2) a nearly linear variation, across all the systems studied,
of the isotropic sigma_iso and uniaxial sigma_ax components, as a function of
the B-O-B bond asymmetry. We show that the anisotropy and linear variation
arise from large paramagnetic contributions to sigma_x and sigma_y due to
virtual transitions between O(2p) and unoccupied B(nd) states. The calculated
isotropic delta_iso and uniaxial delta_ax chemical shifts are in good agreement
with recent BaTiO_3 and SrTiO_3 single crystal 17O NMR measurements. In PbTiO_3
and PbZrO_3, calculated delta_iso are also in good agreement with NMR powder
spectrum measurements. In PbZrO_3, delta_iso calculations of the five
chemically distinct sites indicate a correction of the experimental
assignments. The strong dependence of sigma on covalent O(2p)-B(nd)
interactions seen in our calculations indicates that 17O NMR spectroscopy,
coupled with first principles calculations, can be an especially useful tool to
study the local structure in complex perovskite alloys.

The
pressure allowing for this configuration consists of thermal, turbulent,

contributes ~10% of the total pressure near the plane, with this fraction
dropping towards higher altitudes. Out of the rest, magnetic fields contribute
~1/3 of the pressure to distances of ~3kpc above the disk plane. In this letter
we attempt to extrapolate these local values to high redshift, rapidly
accreting, rapidly star forming disk galaxies and study the effect of the extra
pressure sources on the accretion of gas onto the galaxies. In particular,
magnetic field tension may convert a smooth cold-flow accretion to clumpy,
irregular star formation regions and rates. The infalling gas accumulates on
the edge of the magnetic fields, supported by magnetic tension. When the mass
of the infalling gas exceeds some threshold mass, its gravitational force
cannot be balanced by magnetic tension anymore, and it falls toward the disk's
plane, rapidly making stars. Simplified estimations of this threshold mass are
consistent with clumpy star formation observed in SINS, UDF, GOODS and GEMS
surveys. We discuss the shortcomings of pure hydrodynamic codes in simulating
the accretion of cold flows into galaxies, and emphasize the need for

indicator of the errors in the Earth orientation parameters (EOP) obtained from
VLBI observations. It has been shown that both EOP precision and accuracy can
be well described by the power law $\sigma=aV^c$ in a wide range of the network
size from domestic to global VLBI networks. In other words, as the network
volume grows, the EOP errors become smaller following a power law. This should
be taken into account for a proper comparison of EOP estimates obtained from
different VLBI networks. Thus performing correct EOP comparison allows us to
accurately investigate finer factors affecting the EOP errors. In particular,
it was found that the dependence of the EOP precision and accuracy on the
recording data rate can also be described by a power law. One important
conclusion is that the EOP accuracy depends primarily on the network geometry
and to lesser extent on other factors, such as recording mode and data rate and
scheduling parameters, whereas these factors have stronger impact on the EOP
precision.

corresponding order parameter fluctuations occur on all length scales and
therefore close to the critical point this effect acquires a universal
character, i.e., to a large extent it is independent of the microscopic details
of the actual system. Accordingly it can be calculated theoretically by
studying suitable representative model systems.
  We report on the direct measurement of critical Casimir forces by total

corresponding potentials are determined for individual colloidal particles
floating above a substrate under the action of the critical thermal noise in
the solvent medium, constituted by a binary liquid mixture of water and

adsorption preferences of the colloid and substrate surfaces with respect to
the two components of the binary liquid mixture, we observe that, upon
approaching the critical point of the solvent, attractive or repulsive forces
emerge and supersede those prevailing away from it. Based on the knowledge of
the critical Casimir forces acting in film geometries within the Ising
universality class and with equal or opposing boundary conditions, we provide
the corresponding theoretical predictions for the sphere-planar wall geometry
of the experiment. The experimental data for the effective potential can be

nodes that receive packets from multiple sources and change the timing of
packets, by mixing packets at the output links, to prevent the eavesdropper
from finding sources of outgoing packets. In this paper, we consider two simple
but fundamental scenarios: double input-single output mixer and double
input-double output mixer. For the first case, we use the information-theoretic
definition of the anonymity, based on average entropy per packet, and find an
optimal mixing strategy under a strict latency constraint. For the second case,
perfect anonymity is considered, and maximal throughput strategies with perfect
anonymity are found under a strict latency constraint and an average queue

the discovery of an AGN in one out of the 18 galaxies in the sample. This

greater than the luminosity of the AGN in NGC 4395, the best studied AGN in a

Eddington limit, the lower mass limit for the black hole is ~ 6e3M_sun. The
fact that none of the other galaxies in the sample shows any evidence for an
AGN demonstrates that while the AGN detection rate based on mid-IR diagnostics
is high (30-40%) in optically quiescent galaxies with pseudobulges, it drops
drastically in Sd/Sdm galaxies. Our observations therefore confirm that AGNs in
completely bulgeless disk galaxies are not hidden in the optical but truly are
rare. Of the three Sd galaxies with AGNs known so far, all have prominent NSCs,
suggesting that in the absence of a well-defined bulge, the galaxy must possess
a NSC in order to host an AGN. While the presence of a NSC appears to be a
requirement for hosting an AGN in bulgeless galaxies, neither the properties of
the NSC nor those of the host galaxy appear exceptional in late-type AGN hosts.
The recipe for forming and growing a central black hole in a bulgeless galaxy
therefore remains unknown.

in the LHT but severely suppressed in the SLHM; while for an intermediately
heavy Higgs, both the LHT and SLHM can enhance sizably the SM predictions.

metastable equilibrium states. For this purpose, the Gibbs extremal conditions
are slightly modified in order to be applied to a wide class of non-equilibrium
states. As usual, it is assumed that the system maximizes the entropy
functional $S$, subjected to the standard conditions; i.e., constant energy and
normalization of the probability distribution. However, an extra conserved
constraint function $F$ is also assumed to exist, which forces the system to
remain in the metastable configuration. Further, after assuming additivity for
two quasi-independent subsystems, and that the new constraint commutes with
density matrix $\rho$, it is argued that F should be an homogeneous function of
the density matrix, at least for systems in which the spectrum is sufficiently
dense to be considered as continuous. The explicit form of $F$ turns to be
$F(p_{i})=p_{i}^{q}$, where $p_i$ are the eigenvalues of the density matrix and
$q$ is a real number to be determined. This $q$ number appears as a kind of
Tsallis parameter having the interpretation of the order of homogeneity of the
constraint $F$. The procedure is applied to describe the results of the plasma
experiment of Huang and Driscoll. The experimentally measured density is
predicted with a similar precision as it is done with the use of the extremum
of the enstrophy and Tsallis procedures. However, the present results define
the density at all the radial positions. In particular, the smooth tail shown
by the experimental distribution turns to be predicted by the procedure. In
this way, the scheme avoids the non-analyticity of the density profile at large
distances arising in both of the mentioned alternative procedures.

equation of state, which result in a large amplitude stellar oscillation. The
evolution of the system is simulated by using a 3D Newtonian hydrodynamic code
with a high resolution shock capture scheme. We find that both the temperature
and the density at the neutrinosphere are oscillating with acoustic frequency.
However, they are nearly 180$^{\circ}$ out of phase. Consequently, extremely
intense, pulsating neutrino/antineutrino fluxes will be emitted periodically.
Since the energy and density of neutrinos at the peaks of the pulsating fluxes
are much higher than the non-oscillating case, the electron/positron pair
creation rate can be enhanced dramatically. Some mass layers on the stellar
surface can be ejected by absorbing energy of neutrinos and pairs. These mass
ejecta can be further accelerated to relativistic speeds by absorbing
electron/positron pairs, created by the neutrino and antineutrino annihilation
outside the stellar surface. The possible connection between this process and
the cosmological Gamma-ray Bursts is discussed.

crucial for detecting the gravitational wave generated B-modes. Future
observations of redshifted 21-cm radiation from the cosmological neutral

multipole \ell is found to be proportional to the cold dark matter power
spectrum evaluated at \ell/r, where r denotes the comoving distance to the

on quantities specific to the HI distribution, growth of perturbations and also
the underlying cosmological model. In an ideal ituation, we found that a

is studied for realistic values of both the Prandtl numbers. The two considered
models for the magnetic geometry represent fields with odd and even symmetry
with respect to the equator. In the linear theory in Boussinesq approximation
the resulting complex eigenfrequency (including growth rate and drift rate) are
calculated for a given radial wavenumber of a nonaxisymmetric perturbation with
m=1. The ratio of the Alfven frequency, \Omega_A, to the rate of the basic
rotation, \Omega, controls the eigenfrequency of the solution. For strong
fields with \Omega_A > \Omega the solutions do not feel the thermal diffusion.
The growth rate runs with \Omega_A and the drift rate is close to -\Omega so
that the magnetic pattern will rest in the laboratory system. For weaker fields
with \Omega_A < \Omega the growth rate strongly depends on the thermal
conductivity. For fields with dipolar parity and for typical values of the heat
conductivity the resulting very small growth rates are almost identical with
those for vanishing gravity. For fields with dipolar symmetry the differential
rotation of any stellar radiative zone (like the solar tachocline) is shown as
basically stabilizing the instability independent of the sign of the shear.
Finally, the current-driven kink-type instability of a toroidal background
field is proposed as a model for the magnetism of Ap stars. The recent
observation of a lower magnetic field treshold of about 300 Gauss for Ap stars
is understood as corresponding to the minimum magnetic field producing the
instability.

because of translational invariance, such forces are no longer separable. Using
well known techniques of Talmi and Moshinsky we expand the matrix elements in a
series of separable terms, which converges quickly preserving translational
invariance and finite range. In this way the complicated problem of a cut-off
at large momenta or energies inherent in other separable or zero range pairing
forces is avoided. Applications in the framework of the relativistic Hartree
Bogoliubov approach show that the pairing properties are depicted on almost the

introduced and successfully applied in the description of both static and
dynamic properties of superfluid nuclei. By adjusting the parameters to
reproduce the pairing properties of the Gogny force in nuclear matter, this
separable pairing force is successful in depicting the pairing properties of
ground states and vibrational excitations of spherical nuclei on almost the
same footing as the original Gogny force. In this article, we extend these
investigations for Relativistic Hartree Bogoliubov theory in deformed nuclei
with axial symmetry (RHBZ) using the same separable pairing interaction. In
order to preserve translational invariance we construct one- and
two-dimensional Talmi-Moshinsky brackets for the cylindrical harmonic
oscillator basis. We show that the matrix elements of this force can then be
expanded in a series of separable terms. The convergence of this expansion is
investigated for various deformations. We observe a relatively fast
convergence. This allows for a considerable reduction in computing time as
compared to RHBZ-calculations with the full Gogny force in the pairing channel.
As an example we solve the RHBZ equations with this separable pairing force for
the ground states of the chain of Sm-isotopes. Good agreement with the
experimental data as well as with other theoretical results is achieved.

this model, both the response and predictors can only be observed after being
distorted by some multiplicative factors. Because of nonlinearity, existing
methods for the linear setting cannot be directly employed. To attack this
problem, we propose estimating the distorting functions by nonparametrically
regressing the predictors and response on the distorting covariate; then,
nonlinear least squares estimators for the parameters are obtained using the
estimated response and predictors. Root $n$-consistency and asymptotic
normality are established. However, the limiting variance has a very complex
structure with several unknown components, and confidence regions based on
normal approximation are not efficient. Empirical likelihood-based confidence
regions are proposed, and their accuracy is also verified due to its self-scale
invariance. Furthermore, unlike the common results derived from the profile
methods, even when plug-in estimates are used for the infinite-dimensional
nuisance parameters (distorting functions), the limit of empirical likelihood
ratio is still chi-squared distributed. This property eases the construction of
the empirical likelihood-based confidence regions. A simulation study is
carried out to assess the finite sample performance of the proposed estimators
and confidence regions. We apply our method to study the relationship between
glomerular filtration rate and serum creatinine.

moving average (ARMA) model when regressing the future on the past, but not
when regressing the past on the future. The reason is that, in the latter case,
the regression residuals are only uncorrelated but not statistically
independent of the future. In previous work, we have experimentally verified
that many empirical time series indeed show such a time inversion asymmetry.
For various physical systems, it is known that time-inversion asymmetries are
linked to the thermodynamic entropy production in non-equilibrium states. Here
we show that such a link also exists for the above unidirectional linearity.
  We study the dynamical evolution of a physical toy system with linear
coupling to an infinite environment and show that the linearity of the dynamics
is inherited to the forward-time conditional probabilities, but not to the
backward-time conditionals. The reason for this asymmetry between past and
future is that the environment permanently provides particles that are in a
product state before they interact with the system, but show statistical
dependencies afterwards. From a coarse-grained perspective, the interaction
thus generates entropy. We quantitatively relate the strength of the
non-linearity of the backward conditionals to the minimal amount of entropy
generation.

non-isothermal effects, recent studies have shown that the direction of the
type-I migration can change from inward to outward. In this paper we extend
previous two-dimensional studies, and investigate the planet-disc interaction
in viscous, radiative discs using fully three-dimensional radiation
hydrodynamical simulations of protoplanetary accretion discs with embedded
planets, for a range of planetary masses.
  We use an explicit three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical code NIRVANA that
includes full tensor viscosity. We have added implicit radiation transport in
the flux-limited diffusion approximation, and to speed up the simulations
significantly we have newly adapted and implemented the FARGO-algorithm in a 3D
context.
  First, we present results of test simulations that demonstrate the accuracy
of the newly implemented FARGO-method in 3D. For a planet mass of 20 M_earth we
then show that the inclusion of radiative effects yields a torque reversal also
in full 3D. For the same opacity law used the effect is even stronger in 3D
than in the corresponding 2D simulations, due to a slightly thinner disc.
Finally, we demonstrate the extent of the torque reversal by calculating a
sequence of planet masses. Through full 3D simulations of embedded planets in
viscous, radiative discs we confirm that the migration can be directed outwards
up to planet masses of about 33 M_earth. Hence, the effect may help to resolve
the problem of too rapid inward migration of planets during their type-I phase.

that both quantum entanglement and non-locality (i.e., correlations that
violate Bell-type inequalities) have limited shareability properties and can
sometimes even be monogamous. We give a self-contained review of these results
as well as present new results on the shareability of different kinds of

Further, the relationship between sharing non-local quantum correlations and
sharing mixed entangled states is investigated, and already for the simplest

Also, a recently proposed new interpretation of Bell's theorem by Schumacher in
terms of shareability of correlations is critically assessed. Finally, the
relevance of monogamy of non-local correlations for secure quantum key
distribution is pointed out, although, and importantly, it is stressed that not

subject to neutrino heating. The neutrinos emitted from the remnant at the
center, the protoneutron star (PNS), heat the material above the PNS surface.
This heat is partly converted into kinetic energy and the material accelerates
to an outflow that is known as the neutrino driven wind. For the first time, we
simulate the collapse, bounce, explosion and the neutrino driven wind phases
consistently over more than 20 seconds. Our numerical model is based on
spherically symmetric general relativistic radiation hydrodynamics using
spectral three flavor Boltzmann neutrino transport. In simulations where no
explosions are obtained naturally, we model neutrino driven explosions for low
and intermediate mass Fe-core progenitor stars by enhancing the charged current
reaction rates. In the case of a special progenitor star, the O-Ne-Mg-core, the
explosion in spherical symmetry was obtained without enhanced opacities. The
post explosion evolution is in qualitative agreement with static steady-state
and parametrized dynamic models of the neutrino driven wind. On the other hand,
we find generally smaller neutrino luminosities and mean neutrino energies as
well as a different evolutionary behavior of the neutrino luminosities and mean
neutrino energies. The neutrino driven wind is proton-rich for more than 10
seconds and the contraction of the PNS differs from the assumptions made for
the conditions at the inner boundary in previous neutrino driven wind studies.
Despite the moderately large entropies per baryon of about 100 and the fast
expansion timescale, the conditions found in our model are unlikely to favor...

thermal vibrations in alloy and magnetic phase transitions. Analysis of
diffraction data conclusively proves that this assumption is incorrect. A
simple criterion emerges that theoretical models can ignore the role of thermal
vibrations only if the Debye-Waller Factor is ignored in the analysis of
diffraction data. Diffraction data constrain all theoretical models to
incorporate the role of thermal vibrations. This conclusion is also supported
by other experimental results, the effect of thermal vibrations on ordering
energy that is of the same order of magnitude as ordering energy and an isotope
effect on magnetic phase transitions. An electron-phonon interaction (EPI)
formalism that incorporates the Debye-Waller Factor in electronic structure
calculations already exists and must be adopted for a correct understanding of
phase transitions as it can account for all the different experimental results
mentioned above. The discrepancy between experimental and theoretical ordering
energy in Ni3V is direct evidence for the role of thermal vibrations in
altering ordering energy. The inter-nuclear potential energy term converges if
zero point vibrations are incorporated and this method can replace the Ewald
sum method. The three dimensional Ising model cannot represent order-disorder
transition in beta brass, CuZn. An isotope effect is predicted for magnetic
phase transitions if the transition temperature is below Debye temperature. The
long range order parameter obtained from diffraction data can only be compared
with predictions of models that incorporate the role of thermal vibrations and
not otherwise.

of an MHD simulation having young bipolar outflows and a dense protostellar
disk (a young circumstellar disk) embedded in an infalling envelope.
Synthesized line emission of two molecular species (CO and SiO) show that
subthermally excited SiO lines as a high density tracer can provide a better
probe of the complex velocity field of a YPO, compared to fully thermalized CO
lines. In a YPO at the earliest stage when the outflows are still embedded in
the collapsing envelope, infall, rotation and outflow motions have similar
speeds. We find that the combined velocity field of these components introduces
a great complexity in the line emissions through varying optical thickness and
emissivity, such as asymmetric double-horn profiles. We show that the rotation
of the outflows, one of the features that characterizes an outflow driven by
magneto-centrifugal forces, appears clearly in velocity channel maps and
intensity-weighted mean velocity (first moment of velocity) maps. The somewhat
irregular morphology of the line emission at this youngest stage is dissimilar
to a more evolved object such as young Class 0. High angular resolution
observation by e.g., the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)

normality of aggregate link-weight distribution is generated as a sheer outcome
of aggregation. Commodity-specific networks also display average connectivity,
clustering, and centrality levels very different from their aggregate
counterpart. We also find that ITN complete connectivity is mainly achieved
through the presence of many weak links that keep commodity-specific networks
together and that the correlation structure existing between topological
statistics within each single network is fairly robust and mimics that of the
aggregate network. Finally, we employ cross-commodity correlations between link
weights to build hierarchies of commodities. Our results suggest that on the
top of a relatively time-invariant ``intrinsic"" taxonomy (based on inherent
between-commodity similarities), the roles played by different commodities in
the ITN have become more and more dissimilar, possibly as the result of an
increased trade specialization. Our approach is general and can be used to
characterize any multinetwork emerging as a nontrivial aggregation of several
interdependent layers.

direct numerical simulation of magnetohydrodynamic convective attractors in a
plane layer of conducting fluid with square periodicity cells for the Taylor
number varied from zero to 2000, for which the convective fluid motion halts
(other parameters of the system are fixed). We observe 5 types of hydrodynamic
(amagnetic) attractors: two families of two-dimensional (i.e. depending on two
spatial variables) rolls parallel to sides of periodicity boxes of different
widths and parallel to the diagonal, travelling waves and three-dimensional
""wavy"" rolls. All types of attractors, except for one family of rolls, are
capable of kinematic magnetic field generation. We have found 21 distinct
nonlinear convective MHD attractors (13 steady states and 8 periodic regimes)
and identified bifurcations in which they emerge. In addition, we have observed
a family of periodic, two-frequency quasiperiodic and chaotic regimes, as well
as an incomplete Feigenbaum period doubling sequence of bifurcations of a torus
followed by a chaotic regime and subsequently by a torus with 1/3 of the
cascade frequency. The system is highly symmetric. We have found two novel
global bifurcations reminiscent of the SNIC bifurcation, which are only
possible in the presence of symmetries. The universally accepted paradigm,
whereby an increase of the rotation rate below a certain level is beneficial
for magnetic field generation, while a further increase inhibits it (and halts
the motion of fluid on continuing the increase) remains unaltered, but we
demonstrate that this ""large-scale"" picture lacks many significant details.

Under review",,"10.1063/1.3456062",,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The fluid dynamics of the classical dewetting instability in ultrathin films
is a non-linear process. However, the physical manifestation of the instability
in terms of characteristic length and time scales can be described by a
linearized form of the initial conditions of the films's dynamics. Alternately,
the thermodynamic approach based on equating the rate of free energy decrease
to the viscous dissipation [de Gennes, C. R. Acad. Paris.v298, 1984] can give
similar information. Here we have evaluated dewetting in the presence of
thermocapillary forces arising from a film-thickness (h) dependent temperature.
Such a situation can be found during pulsed laser melting of ultrathin metal
films where nanoscale effects lead to a local h-dependent temperature. The
thermodynamic approach provides an analytical description of this
thermocapillary dewetting. The results of this approach agree with those from
linear theory and experimental observations provided the minimum value of
viscous dissipation is equated to the rate of free energy decrease. The flow
boundary condition that produces this minimum viscous dissipation is when the
film-substrate tangential stress is zero. The physical implication of this
finding is that the spontaneous dewetting instability follows the path of
minimum rate of energy loss.

the total magnetization in the classical Curie-Weiss model, for high
temperatures as well as at the critical temperature $\beta_c=1$, where the
Central Limit Theorem fails. Moreover, we analyze Berry-Esseen bounds as the
temperature $1/ \beta_n$ converges to one and obtain a threshold for the speed
of this convergence. Single spin distributions satisfying the
Griffiths-Hurst-Sherman (GHS) inequality like models of liquid helium or
continuous Curie-Weiss models are considered.

$T^\ast$ in a mean-field treatment of the t-J model including phonons. The
pseudogap phase is identified with the $d$-charge-density wave ($d$-CDW) phase
in this model. Using the small electron-phonon coupling constant $\lambda_d
\sim 0.02$ obtained previously in LDA calculations in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$,
$\alpha^{\ast}$ is negative but negligible small whereas $\alpha$ increases
from about 0.03 at optimal doping to values around 1 at small dopings in
agreement with the general trend observed in many cuprates. Using a simple
phase fluctuation model where the $d$-CDW has only short-range correlations it
is shown that the large increase of $\alpha$ at low dopings is rather universal
and does not depend on the existence of sharp peaks in the density of states in
the pseudogap state or on specific values of the phonon cutoff. It rather is
caused by the large depletion of spectral weight at low frequencies by the
$d$-CDW and thus should also occur in other realizations of the pseudogap.

satisfying mass conservation of the total CME and swept-up corona. The model
contains 14 free parameters and is fitted to the 2008 March 25 CME event

expansion and related EUV dimming during the initial phase from 18:30 UT to
19:00 UT. The CME kinematics can be characterized by a constant acceleration
(i.e., a constant magnetic driving force). While the observations of EUVI/A are
consistent with a spherical bubble geometry, we detect significant asymmetries
and density inhomogeneities with EUVI/B. This new forward-modeling method
demonstrates how the observed EUV dimming can be used to model physical
parameters of the CME source region, the CME geometry, and CME kinematics.

microscopic model for colloidal gels at low volume fractions. The presence of
directional interactions leads to the formation of a persistent interconnected
network at temperatures where phase separation does not occur. We find that
large scale spatial correlations strongly depend on the volume fraction and
characterize the formation of the persistent network. We observe a pre-peak in
the static structure factor and relate it to the network structure. The slow
dynamics at gelation is characterized by the coexistence of fast collective
motion of the mobile parts of the network structure (chains) with large scale
rearrangements producing stretched exponential relaxations. We show that, once
the network is sufficiently persistent, it induces slow, cooperative processes
related to the network nodes. We suggest that this peculiar glassy dynamics is
a hallmark of the physics of colloidal gels at low volume fractions.

the first fast declining Type Ia SN that has been well observed since SN
1999by. While it was subluminous in optical bands compared to more slowly
declining Type Ia SNe, it was not subluminous at maximum light in the near-IR
bands. There appears to be a bimodal distribution in the near-IR absolute
magnitudes of Type Ia SNe at maximum light. Those that peak in the near-IR
after T(B_max) are subluminous in the all bands. Those that peak in the near-IR
prior to T(B_max), such as SN 2003gs, have effectively the same near-IR
absolute magnitudes at maximum light regardless of the decline rate Delta
m_15(B).
  Near-IR spectral evidence suggests that opacities in the outer layers of SN
2003gs are reduced much earlier than for normal Type Ia SNe. That may allow
gamma rays that power the luminosity to escape more rapidly and accelerate the
decline rate. This conclusion is consistent with the photometric behavior of SN
2003gs in the IR, which indicates a faster than normal decline from
approximately normal peak brightness.
