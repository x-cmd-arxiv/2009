extremal black holes in terms of duality invariants of special geometry.
Although this is done for a one-modulus case (the t^3 model), the example gives
$Z \neq 0$ black holes and captures the basic distinction from previous
attempts on the quadratic series (vanishing C tensor) and from the other Z=0
cases. The superpotential W turns out to be a non-polynomial expression
(containing radicals) of the basic duality invariant quantities. These are the
same which enter in the quartic invariant I_4 for N=2 theories based on
symmetric spaces. Using the flow equations generated by W, we also provide the
analytic general solution for the warp factor and for the scalar field

special emphasis is laid on the most recent determinations of $\alpha_s$. These
are obtained from $\tau$-decays, from global fits of electroweak precision data
and from measurements of the proton structure function $\F_2$, which are based
on perturbative QCD calculations up to $O(\alpha_s^4)$; from hadronic event

QCD; from jet production in deep inelastic scattering and from $\Upsilon$
decays, based on $O(\alpha_s^2) $ QCD; and from heavy quarkonia based on
unquenched QCD lattice calculations. Applying pragmatic methods to deal with
possibly underestimated errors and/or unknown correlations, the world average
value of $\alpha_s (M_Z)$ results in $\alpha_s (M_Z) = 0.1184 \pm 0.0007$. The
measured values of $\alpha_s (Q)$, covering energy scales from $Q \equiv \mtau

the near-tip nonlinear zone of scale $\ell_{nl}$, symmetry principles,
causality and scaling arguments. Causality implies that the asymptotic
linear-elastic fields at time $t$ are determined by the crack path at a {\bf
retarded time} $t-\tau_d$, where the delay time $\tau_d$ scales with the ratio
of $\ell_{nl}$ and the typical wave speed $c_{nl}$ within the nonlinear zone.
The resulting equation is shown to agree with known results in the quasi-static
regime. As a first application in the fully dynamic regime, an approximate
analysis predicts a high-speed oscillatory instability whose characteristic
scale is determined by $\ell_{nl}$. This prediction is corroborated by
experimental results, demonstrating the emergence of crack tip inertia-like
effects.

electronic excitations is generated by strong spin orbit coupling. These novel
materials are distinguished from ordinary insulators by the presence of gapless
metallic boundary states, akin to the chiral edge modes in quantum Hall
systems, but with unconventional spin textures. Recently, experiments and
theoretical efforts have provided strong evidence for both two- and
three-dimensional topological insulators and their novel edge and surface
states in semiconductor quantum well structures and several Bi-based compounds.
A key characteristic of these spin-textured boundary states is their
insensitivity to spin-independent scattering, which protects them from
backscattering and localization. These chiral states are potentially useful for
spin-based electronics, in which long spin coherence is critical, and also for
quantum computing applications, where topological protection can enable
fault-tolerant information processing. Here we use a scanning tunneling
microscope (STM) to visualize the gapless surface states of the
three-dimensional topological insulator BiSb and to examine their scattering
behavior from disorder caused by random alloying in this compound. Combining
STM and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we show that despite strong
atomic scale disorder, backscattering between states of opposite momentum and
opposite spin is absent. Our observation of spin-selective scattering
demonstrates that the chiral nature of these states protects the spin of the
carriers; they therefore have the potential to be used for coherent spin
transport in spintronic devices.

discussed and then used for calculating the corresponding wavefunctions of the
two B-DNA base-pairs (adenine-thymine and guanine-cytosine). The obtained HOMO
and LUMO energies of the bases are in good agreement with available
experimental values. Our results are then used for estimating the complete set
of charge transfer parameters between neighboring bases and also between
successive base-pairs, considering all possible combinations between them, for
both electrons and holes. The calculated microscopic quantities can be used in
mesoscopic theoretical models of electron or hole transfer along the DNA double
helix, as they provide the necessary parameters for a tight-binding
phenomenological description based on the $\pi$ molecular overlap. We find that
usually the hopping parameters for holes are higher in magnitude compared to
the ones for electrons, which probably indicates that hole transport along DNA
is more favorable than electron transport. Our findings are also compared with
existing calculations from first principles.

featuring limited spatial resolution, and its relation to the fine-grained

showing it to be not only mathematically well-behaved, but consonant with the
spirit of DFT, practically (computationally) adequate and sufficiently close to
the standard interpretation as to accurately reflect its non-pathological
properties. The coarse-grained interpretation is shown to be a good model of
formal DFT in the sense that: all densities are (ensemble)-V-representable; the
intrinsic energy functional $F$ is a continuous function of the density and the
representing external potential is the (directional) functional derivative of
the intrinsic energy. Also, the representing potential $v[\rho]$ is
quasi-continuous, in that $v[\rho]\rho$ is continuous as a function of $\rho$.
The limit of coarse-graining scale going to zero is studied to see if
convergence to the non-pathological aspects of the fine-grained theory is
adequate to justify regarding coarse-graining as a good approximation. Suitable
limiting behaviors or intrinsic energy, densities and representing potentials
are found. Intrinsic energy converges monotonically, coarse-grained densities
converge uniformly strongly to their low-intrinsic-energy fine-grainings, and
$L^{3/2}+L^\infty$ representability of a density is equivalent to the existence
of a convergent sequence of coarse-grained potential/ground-state density

(first-order Markov) Rayleigh fading channel subject to an average power
constraint. The channel is estimated at the receiver with a pilot signal, and
the estimate is fed back to the transmitter. The estimate is used for coherent
demodulation, and to adapt the data and pilot powers. We explicitly determine
the optimal pilot and data power control policies in a continuous-time limit
where the channel state evolves as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck diffusion process, and
is estimated by a Kalman filter at the receiver. The optimal pilot policy
switches between zero and the maximum (peak-constrained) value (``bang-bang''
control), and approximates the optimal discrete-time policy at low
Signal-to-Noise Ratios (equivalently, large bandwidths). The switching boundary
is defined in terms of the system state (estimated channel mean and associated
error variance), and can be explicitly computed. Under the optimal policy, the
transmitter conserves power by decreasing the training power when the channel
is faded, thereby increasing the data rate. Numerical results show a
significant increase in achievable rate due to the adaptive training scheme
with feedback, relative to constant (non-adaptive) training, which does not
require feedback. The gain is more pronounced at relatively low SNRs and with
fast fading. Results are further verified through Monte Carlo simulations.

curvature or energy density required to be large in Planck units, and quantum
gravitational effects are, in the conventional effective field theory

a multi-hop constrained queueing network with random connectivity whose special
case includes opportunistic multi-hop wireless networks and input-queued switch

policies is closely related to identifying appropriate and universal Lyapunov
functions with negative expected drift. The few well-known throughput optimal
policies in the literature are constructed using simple quadratic or
exponential Lyapunov functions of the queue backlogs and as such they seek to
balance the queue backlogs across network independent of the topology. By
considering a class of continuous, differentiable, and piece-wise quadratic
Lyapunov functions, this paper provides a large class of throughput optimal
routing policies. The proposed class of Lyapunov functions allow for the
routing policy to control the traffic along short paths for a large portion of
state-space while ensuring a negative expected drift. This structure enables
the design of a large class of routing policies. In particular, and in addition
to recovering the throughput optimality of the well known backpressure routing
policy, an opportunistic routing policy with congestion diversity is proved to
be throughput optimal.

more than a factor of two. Furthermore, in the two earlier periods the grain
impact direction was in agreement with the flow direction of the interstellar
helium while in 2005/2006 we observed a shift in the approach direction of the
grains by approximately 30 deg away from the ecliptic plane. The reason for
this shift remains unclear but may be connected with the configuration of the
interplanetary magnetic field during solar maximum. We also find that the dust
measurements are in agreement with the interplanetary flux model of Staubach et
al. (1997) which was developed to fit a 5-year span of Ulysses data.

motions. In addition to the self-consistently generated gravitational torques,
we introduce an effective turbulent \alpha-viscosity with \alpha = 0.01, which
allows us particularly to model accretion in the low-mass regime where disk
self-gravity is diminishing. A range of models with observationally-motivated
values of the initial ratio of rotational to gravitational energy yields a
correlation between mass accretion rate \dot{M} and M_st that is relatively
steep, as observed. Additionally, our modeling reveals evidence for a
bimodality in the \dot{M}--M_st correlation, with a steeper slope at lower
masses and a shallower slope at intermediate and upper masses, as also implied
by observations. We show that the neglect of disk self-gravity leads to a much
steeper \dot{M}--M_st relation for intermediate and upper-mass T Tauri stars.
This demonstrates that an accurate treatment of global self-gravity is

  Methods: IFS observations of Mrk 1418 were carried out with PMAS at the 3.5 m
telescope at CAHA. The central 16""x16"" were mapped. From these data we built
maps of the most prominent emission lines, namely [OII], H-beta, [OIII],
H-alpha, [NII] and [SII] as well as of several continuum bands, plus maps of
the main line ratios: [OIII]/H-beta, [NII]/H-alpha, [SII]/H-alpha, and
H-alpha/H-beta, and derived the physical parameters and gaseous metal
abundances of the different star-forming regions detected in the field of view.
  Results: Mrk 1418 shows a distorted morphology both in the continuum and in
the ionized gas maps; the current star-formation episode is taking place in
five knots, distributed around the nucleus of the galaxy. The interstellar
medium surrounding these knots is photo-ionized by stars, with no clear
evidence for other excitation mechanisms. The galaxy displays an inhomogeneous
dust distribution, with the high H-alpha/H-beta ratio in the central areas
indicating a large amount of dust. The oxygen abundances derived for the
individual star-forming knots are very similar, suggesting that the ionized
interstellar medium is chemically homogeneous in O/H over spatial scales of
hundreds of parsecs. This abundance (Z~0.4 Z_solar from the empirical
calibrations) places Mrk 1418 among the high metallicity BCD group.

chemical enrichment of the intracluster medium (ICM). Such outflows on galactic
scales have their origin in huge star forming regions and expel metal enriched
material out of the galaxies into their surroundings as observed, for example,
in the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 253. As massive stars in OB-associations
explode sequentially, shock waves are driven into the interstellar medium (ISM)
of a galaxy and merge, forming a superbubble (SB). These SBs expand in a
direction perpendicular to the disk plane following the density gradient of the
ISM. We use the 2D analytical approximation by Kompaneets (1960) to model the
expansion of SBs in an exponentially stratified ISM. This is modified in order
to describe the sequence of SN-explosions as a time-dependent process taking
into account the main-sequence life-time of the SN-progenitors and using an
initial mass function to get the number of massive stars per mass interval. The
evolution of the bubble in space and time is calculated analytically, from
which the onset of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities in the shell can be
determined. In its further evolution, the shell will break up and
high-metallicity gas will be ejected into the halo of the galaxy and even into
the ICM. We derive the number of stars needed for blow-out depending on the
scale height and density of the ambient medium, as well as the fraction of
alpha- and iron peak elements contained in the hot gas. Finally, the amount of
metals injected by Milky Way-type galaxies to the ICM is calculated confirming
the importance of this enrichment process.

older than 100 Myr. This disagrees entirely with ages determined either from
the nuclear turn-off, from isochronal matches to low-mass stars or from the
re-appearance of lithium previously found in much lower mass stars (the
``lithium depletion boundary''). We suggest that other parameters besides age,
perhaps composition or rotation, are very influential in determining the degree
of PMS Li-depletion in stars with M greater than 0.5 Msun. Further work is
required to identify and assess the effects of these additional parameters,

the throat of an arbitrary spherical wormhole is analyzed. Einstein's equations
relative to a set of regular coordinates covering a vicinity of the throat
imply that any spherical wormhole can be constructed from solutions of an
effective initial value problem with the throat serving as an initial value
surface. The initial data involve matter variables, the area A(0) of the throat
and the gradient $\Lambda(0)$ of the red shift factor on the throat. Whenever
$\Lambda(0)=0$, the effective potential $V$ has a critical point on the throat.
Conditions upon the data are derived ensuring that the critical point is a
local minimum (resp. maximum). For particular families of Quasi-Schwarzschild
wormholes, $V$ exhibits a local minimum on the throat independently upon the
energy $E$ and angular momentum $L^2 $ of the test particles and thus such
wormholes admit stable circular timelike and null geodesics on the throat. For
families of Chaplygin wormholes, we show that such geodesics are unstable.
Based on a suitable power series representation of the metric, properties of
$V$ away from the throat are obtained that are useful for the analysis of
accretion disks and radiation processes near the throat of any spherical
wormhole.

framework, we find that the concentration parameter depends on the choice of
the considered dark energy (homogeneous or clustered). In particular, if the
distribution of the dark energy is clustered then we produce more concentrated
structures with respect to the homogeneous dark energy. Finally, comparing the
predicted concentration parameter with the observed concentration parameter,
measured for four massive galaxy clusters, we find that the scenario which

bursts (GRBs) have Epeak above the energy range (15-150 keV) of the Burst Alert

of Swift bursts has been difficult. However, by combining data from Swift/BAT
and the Suzaku Wide-band All-Sky Monitor (WAM), which covers the energy range
from 50-5000 keV, for bursts which are simultaneously detected, one can
accurately fit Epeak and Eiso and test the relationship between them for the

2009, there were 48 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) which triggered both Swift/BAT and

of property $(A)$ and strong property $(A)$ in trivial ring extensions and
amalgamated duplication of a ring along an ideal. We also exhibit a class of
rings which satisfy property $(A)$ and do not satisfy strong property $(A)$.

Fermi sea of up-spin Fermions forms a polaronic quasiparticle. The associated
quasiparticle weight vanishes beyond a critical strength of the attractive
interaction, where a many-body bound state is formed. From a variational
wavefunction in the molecular limit, we determine the critical value for the
polaron to molecule transition. The value agrees well with the diagrammatic
Monte Carlo results of Prokof'ev and Svistunov and is consistent with recent
rf-spectroscopy measurements of the quasiparticle weight by Schirotzek et. al.
In addition, we calculate the contact coefficient of the strongly imbalanced
gas, using the adiabatic theorem of Tan and discuss the implications of the
polaron to molecule transition for the phase diagram of the attractive Fermi
gas at finite imbalance.

charge. A formalism has been developed to study vortons in terms of an elastic
string approximation, but its implementation requires knowledge of the unknown
equation of state, relating the string tension to the energy per unit length.
Recently, a planar analogue of the vorton, known as a kinky vorton, has been
introduced. In this paper we derive an exact formula for the equation of state
of a kinky vorton and use it to calculate the properties of the associated
elastic string, such as the transverse and longitudinal propagation speeds. In
particular, the elastic string approximation predicts a complicated and highly
non-trivial pattern of intervals of instability, which we are able to confirm
using full field simulations. The implications of the results for vortons are
also discussed.

transport in a quantum impurity system in a steady state. Here, we develop a
new approach for obtaining the retarded Green's function expressed in resolvent
form. We use the Heisenberg picture to facilitate dynamic theory and propose a
new systematic method of collecting the basis vectors spanning the Liouville
space, which is the most crucial step in obtaining the resolvent Green's
function. We obtain all the linearly independent basis vectors for studying the
single-impurity Anderson models with one and two reservoirs. The latter is an
appropriate model for studying the Kondo phenomenon in a steady state when a
bias is applied. This is one of long standing subjects in theoretical condensed
matter physics.

have been explored in detail. The classification of the surface structure
elements has been carried out, the dimensions of the elements have been
measured, and the relative heights of the surface relief have been determined.
A reconstruction of the Si(001) surface prepared in the molecular-beam epitaxy
chamber has been found to be (8 x n). A model of the Si(001)-(8 x n) surface
structure is proposed.
