that modified gravity (MOG) theories provide a self-consistent,
scale-invariant, universal description of galaxy rotation curves, without the
need of non-baryonic dark matter. Comparison to the predictions of Milgrom's
modified dynamics (MOND) provide a best-fit and experimentally determined
universal value of the MOND acceleration parameter. The predictions of the
modified gravity theories are compared to the predictions of cold non-baryonic
dark matter (CDM), including a constant density core-modified fitting formula,
which produces excellent fits to galaxy rotation curves including the low
surface brightness and dwarf galaxies.
  Upon analysing the mass profiles of clusters of galaxies inferred from X-ray
luminosity measurements, from the smallest nearby clusters to the largest of
the clusters of galaxies, it is shown that while MOG provides consistent fits,
MOND does not fit the observed shape of cluster mass profiles for any value of
the MOND acceleration parameter. Comparison to the predictions of CDM confirm
that whereas the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) fitting formula does not fit the
observed shape of galaxy cluster mass profiles, the core-modified dark matter
fitting formula provides excellent best-fits, supporting the hypothesis that
baryons are dynamically important in the distribution of dark matter halos.

the weak lensing distortion and magnification of undilted samples of red and
blue background galaxies by carefully combining all color and positional
information. Unlike previous work, the weak and strong lensing are in excellent
agreement where the data overlap. The joint mass profile continuously steepens
out to the virial radius with only a minor contribution \sim 10% in the mass
from known subcluster at a projected distance of \sim 700kpc/h. The projected
mass distribution for the entire cluster is well fitted with a single
Navarro-Frenk-White model with a virial mass, M_{vir} = (1.2 \pm 0.2) \times
10^{15} M_{sun}/h, and a concentration, c_{vir} = 9.2^{+1.4}_{-1.2}. This model
fit is fully consistent with the depletion of the red background counts,
providing independent confirmation. Careful examination and interpretation of
X-ray and dynamical data strongly suggest that this cluster system is in a post
collision state, which we show is consistent with our well-defined mass profile
for a major merger occurring along the line of sight, viewed approximately
2-3Gyr after impact when the gravitational potential has had time to relax in
the center, before the gas has recovered and before the outskirts are fully
virialized. Finally, our full lensing analysis provides a model-independent
constraint of M_{2D}(<r_{vir}) = (1.4 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{15} M_{sun}/h for the
projected mass of the whole system, including any currently unbound material
beyond the virial radius, which can constrain the sum of the two pre-merger

F(K) defining the vector field Lagrangian so that an analysis of the viability
of such theories at the cosmological scales has never been performed. As a
first step along this route, we rely on the relation between F(K) and the MOND
interpolating function $\mu(a/a_0)$ to assign the vector field Lagrangian thus
obtaining what we refer to as ""MONDian vector models"". Since they are able by
construction to recover the MOND successes on galaxy scales, we investigate
whether they can also drive the observed accelerated expansion by fitting the
models to the Type Ia Supernovae data. Should be this the case, we have a
unified framework where both dark energy and dark matter can be seen as
different manifestations of a single vector field. It turns out that both
MONDian vector models are able to well fit the low redshift data on Type Ia
Supernovae, while some tension could be present in the high z regime.

subcategories of the stable category of Cohen-Macaulay modules over a

the actual dynamics of confined polymers in disordered systems with topological
constraints on time scales above local equilibration but well below large scale

Unexpectedly, the observed distributions show distinctive differences from free

to attribute these features to entropic trapping in network void spaces. The

  System","32 pages",,,,"q-fin.ST q-fin.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study properties of the cross-sectional distribution of returns. A
significant anti-correlation between dispersion and cross-sectional kurtosis is
found such that dispersion is high but kurtosis is low in panic times, and the
opposite in normal times. The co-movement of stock returns also increases in
panic times. We define a simple statistic $s$, the normalized sum of signs of
returns on a given day, to capture the degree of correlation in the system. $s$
can be seen as the order parameter of the system because if $s= 0$ there is no
correlation (a disordered state), whereas for $s \ne 0$ there is correlation
among stocks (an ordered state). We make an analogy to non-equilibrium phase
transitions and hypothesize that financial markets undergo self-organization
when the external volatility perception rises above some critical value.
Indeed, the distribution of $s$ is unimodal in normal times, shifting to
bimodal in times of panic. This is consistent with a second order phase
transition. Simulations of a joint stochastic process for stocks use a multi
timescale process in the temporal direction and an equation for the order
parameter $s$ for the dynamics of the cross-sectional correlation. Numerical
results show good qualitative agreement with the stylized facts of real data,
in both normal and panic times.

the candidates for the origin of magnetic fields observed in galaxy clusters.
After recombination, the Lorentz force acts on the residual ions and electrons
to generate density fluctuations of baryons. Accordingly these fluctuations
induce the early formation of dark halos which cause the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
(S-Z) effect in cosmic microwave background radiation. This additional S-Z
effect due to primordial magnetic fields amplifies the angular power spectrum
of cosmic microwave temperature anisotropies on small scales. This
amplification depends on the comoving amplitude and the power law index of the
primordial magnetic fields spectrum. Comparing with the small scale CMB
observations, we obtained the constraints on the primordial magnetic fields,
i.e., B < 2.0 nGauss for n=-2.9 or B < 1.0 nGauss for n=-2.6, where B is the
comoving amplitude of magnetic fields at h^-1 Mpc and n is the power law index.
Future S-Z measurements have the potential to give constraints tighter than
those from temperature anisotropies and polarization of cosmic microwave

influence of sun activity represented by sunspot numbers on one of the climate
indicators, specifically rivers, represented by river flow fluctuation for
Daugava, Holston, Nolichucky and French Broad rivers. The Multifractal
Detrended Cross-Correlation Analysis (MF-DXA) shows that there exist some
crossovers in the cross-correlation fluctuation function versus time scale of
the river flow and sunspot series. One of these crossovers corresponds to the
well-known cycle of solar activity demonstrating a universal property of the
mentioned rivers. The scaling exponent given by DCCA for original series at
intermediate time scale, $(12-24)\leq s\leq 130$ months, is $\lambda =
1.17\pm0.04$ which is almost similar for all underlying rivers at
$1\sigma$confidence interval showing the second universal behavior of river
runoffs. To remove the sinusoidal trends embedded in data sets, we apply the
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method. Our results show that there exists a
long-range cross-correlation between the sunspot numbers and the underlying
streamflow records. The magnitude of the scaling exponent and the corresponding
cross-correlation exponent are $\lambda\in (0.76, 0.85)$ and
$\gamma_{\times}\in(0.30, 0.48)$, respectively. Different values for scaling
and cross-correlation exponents may be related to local and external factors
such as topography, drainage network morphology, human activity and so on.
Multifractal cross-correlation analysis demonstrates that all underlying
fluctuations have almost weak multifractal nature which is also a universal
property for data series. In addition the empirical relation between scaling
exponent derived by DCCA and Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA), $
\lambda\approx(h_{\rm sun} + h_{\rm river})/2$ is confirmed.

resistance, or noise, in high quality crystalline magnetic nanowires within
nanoporous templates. The noise increases exponentially with increasing
temperature and magnetic field, and has been analyzed in terms of domain wall
depinning within the Neel-Brown framework. The frequency-dependence of noise
also indicates a crossover from nondiffusive kinetics to long-range diffusion
at higher temperatures, as well as a strong collective depinning, which need to
be considered when implementing these nanowires in magnetoelectronic devices.
