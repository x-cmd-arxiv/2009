elucidate the key concepts that govern the behaviour of the entities that are

to the arrays of 0s and 1s of the early days of computer programming practice.
In this review we present steps towards a diagrammatic `high-level' alternative
for the Hilbert space formalism, one which appeals to our intuition. It allows
for intuitive reasoning about interacting quantum systems, and trivialises many
otherwise involved and tedious computations. It clearly exposes limitations
such as the no-cloning theorem, and phenomena such as quantum teleportation. As
a logic, it supports `automation'. It allows for a wider variety of underlying
theories, and can be easily modified, having the potential to provide the
required step-stone towards a deeper conceptual understanding of quantum
theory, as well as its unification with other physical theories. Specific
applications discussed here are purely diagrammatic proofs of several quantum
computational schemes, as well as an analysis of the structural origin of
quantum non-locality. The underlying mathematical foundation of this high-level
diagrammatic formalism relies on so-called monoidal categories, a product of a
fairly recent development in mathematics. These monoidal categories do not only
provide a natural foundation for physical theories, but also for proof theory,
logic, programming languages, biology, cooking, ... The challenge is to
discover the necessary additional pieces of structure that allow us to predict
genuine quantum phenomena.

monochromatic flux of TeV neutrinos from the galactic center. As an example of
a general scenario, we consider a specific model where the dark matter is a
fermion in the adjoint representation of a hidden SU(N) gauge group that
confines at GeV energies. The absence of light fermionic states in the dark
sector ensures stability of dark matter on cosmological time scales. Dark
matter couples to the standard model via the neutrino portal, that is, the
singlet operator H L constructed from the Higgs and lepton doublets, which is
the lowest dimensional fermionic singlet operator in the standard model. This
coupling prompts dark matter decay where the dominant decay channel has one
neutrino (and at least one dark glueball) in the final state. Other decay
channels with charged standard model particles involve more particles in the
final state and are therefore suppressed by phase space. In consequence, the
standard indirect detection signals like gamma-ray photons, antiprotons and
positrons are suppressed with respect to the neutrino signal. This coupling via
the neutrino portal is most robustly constrained by Super-Kamiokande, which
restricts the dark matter lifetime to be larger than 10^25 seconds. In the near
future, the scenario will be probed by the new generation of neutrino
telescopes. ANTARES will be sensitive to a dark matter lifetime of order 10^26
seconds, while IceCube/DeepCore can probe a lifetime as large as 10^27 seconds.

driving efficient angular momentum transport in astrophysical disks.
Understanding its non-linear saturation constitutes a fundamental problem in
modern accretion disk theory. The large dynamical range in physical conditions
in accretion disks makes it challenging to address this problem only with
numerical simulations. We analyze the concept that (secondary) parasitic
instabilities are responsible for the saturation of the MRI. Our approach
enables us to explore dissipative regimes that are relevant to astrophysical
and laboratory conditions that lie beyond the regime accessible to current
numerical simulations. We calculate the spectrum and physical structure of
parasitic modes that feed off the fastest, exact (primary) MRI mode when its
amplitude is such that the fastest parasitic mode grows as fast as the MRI. We
argue that this ""saturation"" amplitude provides an estimate of the magnetic
field that can be generated by the MRI before the secondary instabilities
suppress its growth significantly. Recent works suggest that the saturation
amplitude of the MRI depends mainly on the magnetic Prandtl number. Our results
suggest that, as long as viscous effects do not dominate the fluid dynamics,
the saturation level of the MRI depends only on the Elsasser number
$\Lambda_\eta$. We calculate the ratio between the stress and the magnetic
energy density, $\alpha_{\rm sat}\beta_{\rm sat}$, associated with the primary
MRI mode. We find that for $\Lambda_\eta >1$ Kelvin-Helmholtz modes are
responsible for saturation and $\alpha_{\rm sat}\beta_{\rm sat} = 0.4$, while
for $\Lambda_\eta < 1$ tearing modes prevail and $\alpha_{\rm sat}\beta_{\rm
sat} \simeq 0.5 \, \Lambda_\eta$. Several features of MRI simulations in
accretion disks surrounding young stars and compact objects can be interpreted
in terms of our findings.

synchrotron - synchrotron self-Compton. The detection of a 31 GeV photon during

the complicated nature of the new phase and a strong relation between the

range of loss functions encompassing regression, classification and survival
analysis. While a well developed theory exists for the l1-penalized least
squares estimates, few results concern the behavior of l1-penalized estimates
for general loss functions. In this paper, we derive two results concerning
penalized estimates for a wide array of penalty and loss functions. Our first
result characterizes the asymptotic distribution of penalized parametric
M-estimators under mild conditions on the loss and penalty functions in the
classical setting (fixed-p-large-n). Our second result explicits necessary and
sufficient generalized irrepresentability (GI) conditions for l1-penalized
parametric M-estimates to consistently select the components of a model
(sparsistency) as well as their sign (sign consistency). In general, the GI
conditions depend on the Hessian of the risk function at the true value of the
unknown parameter. Under Gaussian predictors, we obtain a set of conditions
under which the GI conditions can be re-expressed solely in terms of the second
moment of the predictors. We apply our theory to contrast l1-penalized SVM and
logistic regression classifiers and find conditions under which they have the
same behavior in terms of their model selection consistency (sparsistency and
sign consistency). Finally, we provide simulation evidence for the theory based
on these classification examples.

networks, and cooperation among receivers can help mitigate interference by
forming distributed MIMO systems. The rate at which receivers cooperate,
however, is limited in most scenarios. How much interference can one bit of
receiver cooperation mitigate? In this paper, we study the two-user Gaussian
interference channel with conferencing decoders to answer this question in a
simple setting. We characterize the fundamental gain from cooperation: at high
SNR, when INR is below 50% of SNR in dB scale, one-bit cooperation per
direction buys roughly one-bit gain per user until full receiver cooperation
performance is reached, while when INR is between 67% and 200% of SNR in dB
scale, one-bit cooperation per direction buys roughly half-bit gain per user.
The conclusion is drawn based on the approximate characterization of the
symmetric capacity in the symmetric set-up. We propose strategies achieving the
symmetric capacity universally to within 3 bits. The strategy consists of two
parts: (1) the transmission scheme, where superposition encoding with a simple
power split is employed, and (2) the cooperative protocol, where
quantize-binning is used for relaying.

the latter is always finite and dominated by an effective cosmological
constant. By combining this general feature with the intrinsic fuzziness of

channels. Analytical results are derived for the stationary current response to
a constant bias without assuming any specific coupling to the external fields.
It is shown that anomalous large effective jump lengths, as observed in recent
experiments by taking the ratio of the third order nonlinear and the linear
conductivity, can occur already in ordered systems. Rectification effects due
to site energy disorder in ring systems are expected to become irrelevant for
large system sizes. In open channels in contrast, rectification effects occur
already for disorder in the jump barriers and do not vanish in the
thermodynamic limit. Numerical solutions for a sinusoidal bias show that the
ring system provides a good description for the transport behavior in the open
channel for intermediate and high frequencies. For low frequencies temporal
variations in the mean particle number have to be taken into account in the
open channel, which cannot be captured in the more simple ring model.

mass and temperature to every $N$-body particle and extensively exploits the

number density of simulated minihaloes in the early universe is well described
by the Sheth & Tormen function and consequently the signal powers of simulated
minihaloes are far greater than the Press & Schechter prediction presented by
Furlanetto (2006b). Even though the matter power spectrum measured in the halo
particles at $z=15$ is about an order of magnitude smaller than the
intergalactic medium (IGM), the 21-cm signal fluctuations of haloes are, to the
contrary, one order of magnitude higher than the embedding adiabatic IGM on
scales, $k\lesssim 10 h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. But their spectral shapes are almost
same to each other. We have found that the adiabatic signal power on large
scales lies between the linear predictions of the infinite spin-temperature
model ($T_s\gg T_{\rm cmb}$) and the model with the uniform spin temperature
equal to background value ($T_s = T_s^{bg}$). Higher preheating temperature (or
higher background entropy) makes the power spectrum of signals more flattened
because the hotter IGM signals are more thermally broadened and minihalo
fluctuations dominating on small scales are more severely suppressed by the
higher background entropy. Therefore, this model-dependent power spectrum slope
measured on the scale of $100\le k \le 1000 ~h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ will enable us to
easily determine a best-matching halo + IGM model in future observations.

of key parameters such as EUV luminosity and spectral shape, X-ray luminosity
and spectral shape, and wind mass loss rate and shock speed. Comparing our
models with observations, we conclude that either internal shocks in the winds
or X-rays incident on the disk surfaces often produce the observed [NeII] line,
although there are cases where EUV may dominate. Shocks created by the oblique
interaction of winds with disks are unlikely [NeII] sources because these
shocks are too weak to ionize Ne. Even if [NeII] is mainly produced by X-rays
or internal wind shocks, the neon observations typically place upper limits of
$\lta 10^{42}$ s$^{-1}$ on the EUV photon luminosity of these young low mass
stars. The observed [OI] 6300 \AA line has both a low velocity component (LVC)
and a high velocity component. The latter likely arises in internal wind
shocks. For the former we find that X-rays likely produce more [OI] luminosity
than either the EUV layer, the transition layer between the EUV and X-ray
layer, or the shear layer where the protostellar wind shocks and entrains disk
material in a radial flow across the surface of the disk. Our soft X-ray models
produce [OI] LVCs with luminosities up to $10^{-4}$ L$_\odot$, but may not be
able to explain the most luminous LVCs.

good fit with a smaller eclipse depth that is consistent with our new value. In

incorporating the third and forth moments (skewness and kurtosis) into the

higher order moments do not significantly affect the observed cluster mass and
redshift distributions. However, for high scatter mass indicators it is
necessary for the survey limiting mass threshold to be less than 10^14 h^-1
Msol to prevent the skewness from having a significant impact on the observed
number counts, particularly at high redshift. We also show that an unknown
level of non-Gaussianity in the scatter is equivalent to an additional
uncertainty on the variance in P(Mobs|M) and thus may limit the constraints
that can be placed on the dark energy equation of state parameter w.
Furthermore, positive skewness flattens the mass function at the high mass end,
and so one must also account for skewness in P(Mobs|M) when using the shape of
the mass function to constrain cluster scaling-relations.

provide evidence that the junction resistance could be described by a simple
Ohmic sum of the n and p mediums' resistances. However in the ballistic limit,
theory predicts the existence of chirality-dependent quantum Hall plateaus in a
pn junction. We show that two distinctively separate processes are required for
this ballistic-Ohmic plateau transition, namely (i) hole/electron Landau states
equilibration and (ii) valley iso-spin dilution of the incident Landau edge
state. These conclusions are obtained by a simple scattering theory argument,
and confirmed numerically by performing ensembles of quantum magneto-transport
calculations on a 0.1um-wide disordered graphene pn junction within the
tight-binding model. The former process is achieved by pn interface roughness,
where a pn interface disorder with a root-mean-square roughness of 10nm was
found to suffice under typical experimental conditions. The latter process is
mediated by extrinsic edge roughness for an armchair edge ribbon and by
intrinsic localized intervalley scattering centers at the edge of the pn
interface for a zigzag ribbon. In light of these results, we also examine why
higher Ohmic type plateaus are less likely to be observable in experiments.

supernova (1.4 x 10^51 erg). The event was more luminous than the type IIn SN
2006gy, but exhibited same smooth, slowly evolving light curve. As is
characteristic of type IIn SN, the early spectra of 2008fz initially exhibited
narrow Balmer lines which were replaced by a broader component at later times.
The spectra also show a blue continuum with no signs of Ca or Na absorption,
suggesting that there is little extinction due to intragalatic dust in the host

reaching R ~ 22. From the supernova's redshift, z=0.133, we place an upper
limit on the host of M_R=-17. The presence of the SN within such a faint host
follows the majority of recently discovered highly luminous SN. A possible
reason for this occurrence is the very high star formation rate occurring in
low-mass galaxies in combination with the low metallicity environment, which
makes the production of very massive stars possible. We determine the peak
absolute magnitude of the event to be M_V = -22.3 from the initial photometry

profiles of [OIII] 5007,4959 and other narrow emission-lines, motivated by the
prospect of finding candidate binary AGN. These objects were identified by
means of a visual examination of 21,592 quasars at z < 0.7 in SDSS Data Release
7 (DR7). Of the spectra with adequate signal-to-noise, 148 spectra exhibit a
double-peaked [OIII] profile. Of these, 86 are Type 1 AGN and 62 are Type 2
AGN. Only two give the appearance of possibly being optically resolved double
AGN in the SDSS images, but many show close companions or signs of recent
interaction. Radio-detected quasars are three times more likely to exhibit a
double-peaked [OIII] profile than quasars with no detected radio flux,
suggesting a role for jet interactions in producing the double-peaked profiles.
Of the 66 broad line (Type 1) AGN that are undetected in the FIRST survey, 0.9%
show double peaked [OIII] profiles. We discuss statistical tests of the nature
of the double-peaked objects. Further study is needed to determine which of
them are binary AGN rather than disturbed narrow line regions, and how many
additional binaries may remain undetected because of insufficient line-of-sight
velocity splitting. Previous studies indicate that 0.1% of SDSS quasars are
spatially resolved binaries, with typical spacings of ~10 to 100 kpc. If a
substantial fraction of the double-peaked objects are indeed binaries, then our
results imply that binaries occur more frequently at smaller separations (< 10
kpc). This suggests that simultaneous fueling of both black holes is more
common as the binary orbit decays through these spacings.

low-density oxygen in the Intergalactic Medium (IGM). Oxygen absorption is
detected on a pixel-by-pixel basis by its correlation with Lyman-alpha forest
absorption. We have developed a novel Locally Calibrated Pixel (LCP) search
method that uses adjacent regions of the spectrum to calibrate interlopers and
spectral artifacts, which would otherwise limit the measurement of OVI
absorption. Despite the challenges presented by searching for weak OVI within
the Lyman-alpha forest in spectra of moderate resolution and signal-to-noise,
we find a highly significant detection of absorption by oxygen at 2.7 < z < 3.2
(the null hypothesis has a chi^2=80 for 9 data points).
  We interpret our results using synthetic spectra generated from a lognormal
density field assuming a mixed quasar-galaxy photoionizing background (Haardt &
Madau 2001) and that it dominates the ionization fraction of detected OVI. The
LCP search data can be fit by a constant metallicity model with [O/H] =
-2.15_(-0.09)^(+0.07), but also by models in which low-density regions are
unenriched and higher density regions have a higher metallicity. The
density-dependent enrichment model by Aguirre et al. (2008) is also an
acceptable fit. All our successful models have similar mass-weighted oxygen
abundance, corresponding to [<O/H>_MW] = -2.45+-0.06. This result can be used
to find the cosmic oxygen density in the Lyman-alpha forest, Omega_(Oxy, IGM) =
1.4(+-0.2)x10^(-6) = 3x10^(-4) Omega_b. This is the tightest constraint on the
mass-weighted mean oxygen abundance and the cosmic oxygen density in the
Lyman-alpha forest to date and indicates that it contains approximately 16% of
metals produced by star formation (Bouch\'e et al. 2008) up to z = 3.

problem of forecasting attack sources (also referred to as predictive
blacklisting) based on shared attack logs as an implicit recommendation system.
We compare the performance of existing approaches against the upper bound for
prediction, and we demonstrate that there is much room for improvement.
Inspired by the recent Netflix competition, we propose a multi-level prediction
model that is adjusted and tuned specifically for the attack forecasting
problem. Our model captures and combines various factors, namely:
attacker-victim history (using time-series) and attackers and/or victims
interactions (using neighborhood models). We evaluate our combined method on

available in large future samples of galaxy clusters, could be used to
constrain not only cluster structure, but also cosmology. We study the utility
of this approach, employing a physically motivated parametric model to describe
cluster structure, and applying it to the expected relation between the
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich decrement (S_\nu) and the emission-weighted X-ray
temperature (T_ew). The slope and normalization of the entropy profile, the
concentration of the dark matter potential, the pressure at the virial radius,
and the level of non-thermal pressure support, as well as the mass and
redshift-dependence of these quantities are described by free parameters. With
a suitable choice of fiducial parameter values, the cluster model satisfies
several existing observational constraints. We employ a Fisher matrix approach
to estimate the joint errors on cosmological and cluster structure parameters
from a measurement of S_\nu vs. T_ew in a future survey. We find that different
cosmological parameters affect the scaling relation differently: predominantly
through the baryon fraction (\Omega_m and \Omega_b), the virial overdensity
(w_0 and w_a for low-z clusters) and the angular diameter distance (w_0, w_a
for high-z clusters; \Omega_DE and h). We find that the cosmology constraints
from the scaling relation are comparable to those expected from the number
counts (dN/dz) of the same clusters. The scaling relation approach is
relatively insensitive to selection effects and it offers a valuable
consistency check; combining the information from the scaling relation and
dN/dz is also useful to break parameter degeneracies and help disentangle
cluster physics from cosmology.

interference in space at a fixed time observed in reported BEC experiments. We
predict and quantify the quantum interference in the TOF distribution
calculated from the modulus of the quantum probability current density (rather
than the TOF distributions obtained from a purely classical or semi-classical
treatment in many reported experiments). The interference and hence the
coherence in the quantum TOF signal disappears in the large-mass limit. Our
scheme has the potential to probe the validity of various other theoretical
approaches (Phys. Rep. 338, 353 (2000)) of calculating the quantum arrival time
distribution.

investigate the influence of environmental quality on the accessibility of
adaptive phenotypes of Escherichia coli's central metabolic network. We used an
established flux-balance model of metabolism as the basis for a
genotype-phenotype map (GPM). We quantified the effects of seven qualitatively
different environments (corresponding to both carbohydrate and gluconeogenic
metabolic substrates) on the structure of this GPM. We found that the GPM has a
more rugged structure in qualitatively poorer environments, suggesting that
adaptive phenotypes could be intrinsically less accessible in such
environments. Nevertheless, on average ~74% of the genotype can be altered by
neutral drift, in the environment where the GPM is most rugged; this could
allow evolving populations to circumvent such ruggedness. Furthermore, we found
that the normalized mutual information (NMI) of genotype differences relative
to phenotype differences, which measures the GPM's capacity to transmit
information about phenotype differences, is positively correlated with
(simulation-based) estimates of the accessibility of adaptive phenotypes in
different environments. These results are consistent with the predictions of a
simple analytic theory and they suggest an intuitive information-theoretic
principle for evolutionary adaptation; adaptation could be faster in

test whether the machine learning algorithm can reproduce the human

when adding adaptive shape parameters as well as concentration and texture. The
adaptive moments, concentration and texture parameters alone cannot distinguish
between early type galaxies and the point sources/artifacts. Using a set of

that using a training set that is incomplete in magnitude does not degrade our

boundary is uniquely determined by its Gauss image. Furthermore, any spherical
metric on the torus with cone singularities of negative curvature and all
closed contractible geodesics of length greater than $2\pi$ is the metric of
the Gauss image of some convex polyhedral cusp. This result is an analog of the
Rivin-Hodgson theorem characterizing compact convex hyperbolic polyhedra in
terms of their Gauss images.
  The proof uses a variational method. Namely, a cusp with a given Gauss image
is identified with a critical point of a functional on the space of cusps with
cone-type singularities along a family of half-lines. The functional is shown
to be concave and to attain maximum at an interior point of its domain. As a
byproduct, we prove rigidity statements with respect to the Gauss image for
cusps with or without cone-type singularities.
  In a special case, our theorem is equivalent to existence of a circle pattern
on the torus, with prescribed combinatorics and intersection angles. This is
the genus one case of a theorem by Thurston. In fact, our theorem extends
Thurston's theorem in the same way as Rivin-Hodgson's theorem extends Andreev's
theorem on compact convex polyhedra with non-obtuse dihedral angles.
  The functional used in the proof is the sum of a volume term and curvature
term. We show that, in the situation of Thurston's theorem, it is the potential
for the combinatorial Ricci flow considered by Chow and Luo.

variants: When implementing min, should one also implement max? Should one
implement linear constraints both with unit and non-unit coefficients?
Constraint variants are ubiquitous: implementing them requires considerable (if
not prohibitive) effort and decreases maintainability, but will deliver better
performance than resorting to constraint decomposition.
  This paper shows how to use views to derive perfect propagator variants. A
model for views and derived propagators is introduced. Derived propagators are
proved to be indeed perfect in that they inherit essential properties such as
correctness and domain and bounds consistency. Techniques for systematically
deriving propagators such as transformation, generalization, specialization,
and type conversion are developed. The paper introduces an implementation
architecture for views that is independent of the underlying constraint
programming system. A detailed evaluation of views implemented in Gecode shows
that derived propagators are efficient and that views often incur no overhead.
Without views, Gecode would either require 180 000 rather than 40 000 lines of
propagator code, or would lack many efficient propagator variants. Compared to
8 000 lines of code for views, the reduction in code for propagators yields a
1750% return on investment.

crystallographic orientations were measured with time-resolved VISAR
interferometry at shock stresses in the range 16 to 86 GPa. Shock propagation
was normal to the surface of each cut. The angle between the c-axis of the
hexagonal crystal structure and the direction of shock propagation varied from
0 for c-cut up to 90 degrees for m-cut in the basal plane. Based on published
shock-induced transparencies, shock-induced optical transparency correlates
with the smoothness of the shock-wave profile. The ultimate goal was to find
the direction of shock propagation in sapphire that is most transparent as a
window. Particle velocity histories were recorded at the interface between a
sapphire crystal and a LiF window. In most cases measured wave profiles are
noisy as a result of heterogeneity of deformation. Measured values of Hugoniot
Elastic Limits (HELs) depend on direction of shock compression and peak shock
stress. The largest HEL values were recorded for shock loading along the c-axis
and perpendicular to c along the m-direction. Shock compression along the m-
and s-directions is accompanied by the smallest heterogeneity of deformation
and the smallest rise time of the plastic shock wave. m- and s-cut sapphire
most closely approach ideal elastic-plastic flow, which suggests that m- and
s-cut sapphire are probably the orientations that remains most transparent to
highest shock pressures. Under purely elastic deformation sapphire has very
high spall strength, which depends on load duration and peak stress. Plastic
deformation of sapphire causes loss of its tensile strength.

0.15$ mag even if the host extinction is $A_{V}=0$ mag. It reaches
$M_{V}=-20.19\pm 0.19$ mag for the host extinction of $A_{V}=0.29$ mag as
inferred from the observed Na {\sc i} D line absorption in the host. Our
$JHK_{s}$-band photometry shows that the SN is one of the most luminous SNe Ia
also in near-infrared wavelengths. These results indicate that SN 2009dc
belongs to the most luminous class of SNe Ia, like SN 2003fg and SN 2006gz. We
estimate the ejected $^{56}$Ni mass of $1.2\pm 0.3$ $\Msun$ for no host
extinction case (or 1.6$\pm$ 0.4 M$_{\odot}$ for the host extinction of
$A_{V}=0.29$ mag). The C {\sc ii} $\lambda$6580 absorption line keeps visible
until a week after maximum, which diminished in SN 2006gz before its maximum
brightness. The line velocity of Si {\sc ii} $\lambda$6355 is about 8000 km
s$^{-1}$ around the maximum, being considerably slower than that of SN 2006gz,
while comparable to that of SN 2003fg. The velocity of the C {\sc ii} line is
almost comparable to that of the Si {\sc ii}. The presence of the carbon line
suggests that thick unburned C+O layers remain after the explosion. SN 2009dc
is a plausible candidate of the super-Chandrasekhar mass SNe Ia.

The classical method of using unweighted UBV photometry to simultaneously

for clusters older than approx. 30 Ma, even for relatively large cluster
masses. On the other hand, augmenting the filter set to include
longer-wavelength filters and using weights for each filter increases the range

provably achieves, at sufficiently short branch lengths, a polylogarithmic
sequence-length requirement -- improving significantly over previous polynomial
bounds for distance-based methods. The technique is based on an averaging
procedure that implicitly reconstructs ancestral sequences.
  In the same token, we extend previous results on phase transitions in
phylogeny reconstruction to general time-reversible models. More precisely, we
show that in the so-called Kesten-Stigum zone (roughly, a region of the
parameter space where ancestral sequences are well approximated by ``linear
combinations'' of the observed sequences) sequences of length $\poly(\log n)$
suffice for reconstruction when branch lengths are discretized. Here $n$ is the
number of extant species.
  Our results challenge, to some extent, the conventional wisdom that estimates
of evolutionary distances alone carry significantly less information about

languages. A language L over an alphabet Sigma is a right (left) ideal if it
satisfies L = L Sigma* (L = Sigma* L). It is a two-sided ideal if L = Sigma* L
Sigma *, and an all-sided ideal if it is the shuffle of Sigma* with L. We
prefer the term ""quotient complexity"" instead of ""state complexity"", and we use
derivatives to calculate upper bounds on quotient complexity, whenever it is
convenient. We find tight upper bounds on the quotient complexity of each type
of ideal language in terms of the complexity of an arbitrary generator and of
its minimal generator, the complexity of the minimal generator, and also on the
operations union, intersection, set difference, symmetric difference,
concatenation, star and reversal of ideal languages.

with the non-viscous Burgers equation we construct a solution to the Riemann
problem for the pressureless gas dynamics describing sticky particles. As a
bridging step we consider a medium consisting of noninteracting particles. We
analyze the difference in the behavior of discontinuous solutions for these two
models and the relations between them. In our framework we obtain a unique
entropy solution to the Riemann problem in 1D case. Moreover, we describe how
starting from smooth data a $\delta$ - singularity arises in one component of
the solution.

  Properties",,,,,"q-fin.GN physics.soc-ph q-fin.TR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper begins to explore the determinants of the topological properties
of the international - trade network (ITN). We fit bilateral-trade flows using
a standard gravity equation to build a ""residual"" ITN where trade-link weights
are depurated from geographical distance, size, border effects, trade
agreements, and so on. We then compare the topological properties of the
original and residual ITNs. We find that the residual ITN displays, unlike the
original one, marked signatures of a complex system, and is characterized by a
very different topological architecture. Whereas the original ITN is
geographically clustered and organized around a few large-sized hubs, the
residual ITN displays many small-sized but trade-oriented countries that,
independently of their geographical position, either play the role of local
hubs or attract large and rich countries in relatively complex
trade-interaction patterns.

by transition kernels that approximately (in n) depend only on the rescaled
state n^{-1} Z^n. Subject to a smoothness condition, such a family can be
closely coupled on short time intervals to a Brownian motion with quadratic
drift. This construction is used to determine the first two terms in the
asymptotic (in n) expansion of the probability that the rescaled chain exits a
convex polytope. The constant term and the first correction of size n^{-1/6}
admit sharp characterization by solutions to associated differential equations
and an absolute constant. The error is smaller than O(n^{-b}) for any b < 1/4.
  These results are directly applied to the analysis of randomized algorithms
at phase transitions. In particular, the `peeling' algorithm in large random
hypergraphs, or equivalently the iterative decoding scheme for low-density
parity-check codes over the binary erasure channel is studied to determine the
finite size scaling behavior for irregular hypergraph ensembles.

multiset with $a_i$ elements of type $i$, $1\le i\le m$. The counting function
for this statistic is the $q$ analog of the multinomial coefficient
$\binom{a_1+...+a_m}{a_1,... a_m}$, and the probability generating function is
the normalization of the latter. We give two proofs that the distribution is
asymptotically normal. The first is {\it computer-assisted}, based on the
method of moments. The Maple package {\tt MahonianStat}, available from the
webpage of this article, can be used by the reader to perform experiments and
calculations. Our second proof uses characteristic functions. We then take up
the study of a local limit theorem to accompany our central limit theorem. Here
our result is less general, and we must be content with a conjecture about
further work. Our local limit theorem permits us to conclude that the
coeffiecients of the $q$-multinomial are log-concave, provided one stays near
the center (where the largest coefficients reside.)
