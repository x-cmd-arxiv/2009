networks (i.e. networks that can be mapped to geometric graphs in some space)
and for developing algorithms that estimate (i.e. map) the state and functional
topology of complex dynamic geometric net- works. Within the framework we
define the key features typically present in such networks and of particular
relevance to biological cellular neural networks: Dynamics, signaling,
observation, and control. The framework is particularly well-suited for
estimating functional connectivity in cellular neural networks from
experimentally observable data, and has been implemented using graphics
processing unit (GPU) high performance computing. Computationally, the
framework can simulate cellular network signaling close to or faster than real
time. We further propose a standard test set of networks to measure performance
and compare different mapping algorithms.

We also propose a simple method to estimate the number of the seed photons

external forward shock electrons. The seed photons needed in the modeling are
too many to be realistic for both events. The synchrotron radiation of the
forward shock seems able to account for the GeV afterglow data.

discrepancy to the fact that WMAP cold spot's temperature profile just happens
to favor the particular profile given by the wavelet. Since randomly generated

cold spot significance originated at least partly due to a fortuitous choice of
using a particular basis of weight functions. We also examine significance of a

  Star Formation and Stellar Populations in Interacting Galaxies""",,,,"astro-ph.CO astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Galaxy interactions are known to trigger starbursts. Young massive star
clusters formed in interacting galaxies and mergers may become young globular
clusters. The ages of these clusters can provide clues about the timing of
interaction-triggered events, and thus provide an important way to reconstruct
the star formation history of merging galaxies. Numerical simulations of galaxy
mergers can implement different star formation rules. For instance, star
formation dependent on gas density or triggered by shocks, predicts
significantly different star formation histories. To test the validity of these
models, multi-object spectroscopy was used to map the ages of young star
clusters throughout the bodies and tails of a series of galaxy mergers at
different stages (Arp 256, NGC 7469, NGC 4676, Arp 299, IC 883 and NGC 2623).
We found that the cumulative distribution of ages becomes shallower as the
stage of merger advances. This result suggests a trend of cluster ages as a
function of merger stage. In NGC 4676 we found that two clusters have ages of
about 170 Myr, suggesting that they likely formed during its first passage.
Their locations in the tidal tails are consistent with the spatial distribution
of star formation predicted by shock-induced models. When comparing the ages
and spatial distribution of clusters in NGC 7252 to our model, we found that
some clusters are likely to form during the prompt starburst at first passage,
as predicted by simulations with shock-induced star formation. These
simulations show that the shock-induced mechanism is an important trigger of
star formation and that using the ages of clusters formed in the starbursts can
effectively determine the star formation history of merging galaxies.

We examine the jet propagation, morphology and magnetic field structure for a
wide range of density contrasts, using a globally consistent setup for both the
jet interaction and the magnetic field. The MHD code NIRVANA is used to evolve
the simulation, using the constrained-transport method. The density contrasts
are varied between \eta = 10^{-1} and 10^{-4} with constant sonic Mach number
6. The jets are supermagnetosonic and simulated bipolarly due to the low jet
densities and their strong backflows. The helical magnetic field is largely
confined to the jet, leaving the ambient medium nonmagnetic. We find magnetic
fields with plasma \beta \sim 10 already stabilize and widen the jet head.
Furthermore they are efficiently amplified by a shearing mechanism in the jet
head and are strong enough to damp Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities of the
contact discontinuity. The cocoon magnetic fields are found to be stronger than
expected from simple flux conservation and capable to produce smoother lobes,
as found observationally. The bow shocks and jet lengths evolve self-similarly.
The radio cocoon aspect ratios are generally higher for heavier jets and grow
only slowly (roughly self-similar) while overpressured, but much faster when
they approach pressure balance with the ambient medium. In this regime,
self-similar models can no longer be applied. Bow shocks are found to be of low
excentricity for very light jets and have low Mach numbers. Cocoon turbulence
and a dissolving bow shock create and excite waves and ripples in the ambient
gas. Thermalization is found to be very efficient for low jet densities.

establish a mathematical relation among the set of variables which better
describe the physical characteristics of the host star and the planet itself.
The host star is characterized by its distance, age, effective temperature,
mass, metallicity, radius and magnitude. The exoplanet is described through its
physical parameters (radius and mass) and its orbital parameters (distance,
period, eccentricity, inclination and major semiaxis). As a first approach we
consider that only the mass of the exoplanet is being determined by the
physical properties of its host star. The proposed model is then validated
through statistical analysis. Finally we discuss the categorical behavior of
the dependent variable through binary models.

strength bit plane of digital signature watermark is embedded in to a
significant bit plane of the original image. The combination of bit planes

is developed for appropriate bit plane selection. Ten different attacks are
selected to test different alternatives. These attacks are given different
weightings as appropriate to user requirement. A weighted correlation
coefficient for retrieved watermark is estimated for each of the alternatives.
Based on these estimated values optimal bit plane combination is identified for
a given user requirement. The proposed method is found to be useful for

capable of recovering exactly scatterers of sufficiently low sparsity.
  For point targets, various sampling techniques are proposed to transform the
scattering matrix into the random Fourier matrix. The results for point targets

from grid points. In particular, an explicit error bound is derived for the

matrix into a block-diagonal matrix with each block being the random Fourier
matrix corresponding to one of the multiple dyadic scales of the extended
target. In other words by the Littlewood-Paley basis and the proposed sampling

and bind to collapsing matter perturbations if the string tension is less than
a critical value and if the loops are large-scale. For typical model parameters
(velocity dispersion of newly formed loops, loop length distribution, etc.) the
galactic loop density is greatly enhanced as compared to the universe's mean
loop density. The limiting enhancement of loop (energy) density is 0.25-0.4
times the enhancement of cold dark matter (ratio of galaxy to universe's dark
matter densities) and is fully achieved for dimensionless string tensions less
than 10^-13 at galactic scales less than 100 kpc. The enhancement is
substantial for any tension less than the critical value which is of order
10^-9. The fact that the string loop enhancement roughly tracks that of cold
dark matter is a robust result for small tension and large-scale fragmentation.
Experiments sensitive to the local Galactic population of loops, especially

z=6.43 (CFHQSJ2329-0301, the highest redshift QSO currently known) in deep z'
and z_r-band images of the Subaru/Suprime-Cam. After a careful PSF (QSO)
subtraction, a structure in the z'-band extends more than 4'' on the sky
(R_e=11 kpc), and thus, is well-resolved (16sigma detection). The
PSF-subtracted z_r-band structure is in a similar shape to that in the z'-band,
but less significant with a 3 sigma detection. In the z'-band, a radial profile
of the QSO+host shows a clear excess over that of the averaged PSF in 0.8-3''
radius.
  Since the z'-band includes a Lya emission at z=6.43, the z' flux is perhaps a
mixture of the host (continuum light) and its Lya emission, whereas the
z_r-band flux is from the host. Through a SED modeling, we estimate 40% of the
PSF-subtracted z'-band light is from the host (continuum) and 60% is from Lya
emission. The absolute magnitude of the host is M_{1450}=-23.9 (c.f.
M_{1450}=-26.4 for the QSO). A lower limit of the SFR(Lya) is 1.6 Msun yr^{-1}
with stellar mass ranging 6.2 x 10^8 to 1.1 x 10^10 Msun when 100 Myrs of age
is assumed. The detection shows that a luminous QSO is already harbored by a
large, star-forming galaxy in the early Universe only after ~840 Myr after the
big bang. The host may be a forming giant galaxy, co-evolving with a super

from the fact that this is a desirable property if one wants to refine the

While terrestrial fog can form from a variety of causes, most of these

evaporation of liquid methane; the detection of fog provides the first direct

ellipticals. We show that in all cases the maximum stellar surface density
attained in the central regions of these systems is similar, Sigma_max ~ 10^11
M_sun/kpc^2 (~20 g/cm^2), despite the fact that the systems span 7 orders of
magnitude in total stellar mass M_star, 5 in effective radius R_e, and have a
wide range in effective surface density M_star/R_e^2. The surface density limit
is reached on a wide variety of physical scales in different systems and is
thus not a limit on three-dimensional stellar density. Given the very different
formation mechanisms involved in these different classes of objects, we argue
that a single piece of physics likely determines Sigma_max. The radiation
fields and winds produced by massive stars can have a significant influence on
the formation of both star clusters and galaxies, while neither supernovae nor
black hole accretion are important in star cluster formation. We thus conclude
that feedback from massive stars likely accounts for the observed Sigma_max,
plausibly because star formation reaches an Eddington-like flux that regulates
the growth of these diverse systems. This suggests that current models of
galaxy formation, which focus on feedback from supernovae and active galactic
nuclei, are missing a crucial ingredient.

Unfortunately, axion potentials in UV-complete theories appear to be too steep

Due to this coupling, quanta of the gauge field are produced by the rolling of

down the axion, leading to inflation even for a steep potential. The spectrum

examined. Past attempts to analyse these models have been hampered by infrared
divergences that appear at non-zero temperature. We argue that previous
attempts to circumvent this problem are not satisfactory and demonstrate a
simple resolution. We also show that the expectation that confining models do
not exhibit a chiral phase transition is incorrect. The effect of summing ring
diagrams is investigated and we present the first determination of the
temperature-density phase diagram for two model systems. We find that
observables and the phase structure of the confinement models depend strongly
on whether quark polarisation is accounted for. Finally, it appears that
standard confinement models cannot adequately describe both hadron
phenomenology and in-medium properties of QCD.

describe theoretical approaches to understanding them--in particular, viscous
hydrodynamic simulations and investigations of final state interactions.
  The successful ideal hydrodynamic models of the collisions at the
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) were extended by performing viscous
hydrodynamic simulations. This was done by making use of the recently derived
full conformally invariant second order relativistic viscous hydrodynamic
equations. Results for multiplicity, radial flow and elliptic flow in
sqrt{s_NN}=200 GeV Au+Au RHIC collisions are presented and the range of the
ratio of shear viscosity over entropy density eta/s for which our hydrodynamic
model is consistent with experimental data is quoted.
  In addition, simulations were performed of the planned sqrt{s_NN}=5.5 TeV
Pb+Pb and sqrt{s}=14 TeV p+p collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The
elliptic flow coefficient v_2 is predicted to be 10% larger for the Pb+Pb
collisions compared to top energy RHIC collisions, and is predicted to be
consistent with zero for proton collisions unless eta/s < 0.08.
  Finally, final state interactions were investigated within the distorted wave
emission function (DWEF) model. Work is presented on an improved understanding
of the DWEF model, and the potential effect of final state interactions in the
form of a pion optical potential on the elliptic flow coefficient v_2 was
calculated to be at the ~20% level.

the circle in the sense of Labourie via pullback of our generalized cross ratio
along a suitable limit curve. In this context our translation length estimates

focused on spherical particles, and very little is known about dense polyhedral

within an adaptive fundamental cell subject to periodic boundary conditions as
an optimization problem, which we call the Adaptive Shrinking Cell (ASC)

multi-particle initial configurations) to find dense packings of each of the
Platonic solids in three-dimensional Euclidean space. We find the densest known

$0.782...$, $0.947...$, $0.904...$, and $0.836...$, respectively. Unlike the
densest tetrahedral packing, which must be a non-Bravais lattice packing, the
densest packings of the other non-tiling Platonic solids that we obtain are
their previously known optimal (Bravais) lattice packings. Our simulations
results, rigorous upper bounds that we derive, and theoretical arguments lead
us to the strong conjecture that the densest packings of the Platonic and

states is a non-linear function of time, is usually identified in real
stochastic processes by comparing experimental and theoretical displacements at
relatively small time intervals. This paper proposes an interpolation
expression for the identification of anomalous diffusion in complex signals for
the cases when the dynamics of the system under study reaches a steady state
(large time intervals). This interpolation expression uses the chaotic
difference moment (transient structural function) of the second order as an
average characteristic of displacements. A general procedure for identifying
anomalous diffusion and calculating its parameters in real stochastic signals,
which includes the removal of the regular (low-frequency) components from the
source signal and the fitting of the chaotic part of the experimental
difference moment of the second order to the interpolation expression, is
presented. The procedure was applied to the analysis of the dynamics of
magnetoencephalograms, blinking fluorescence of quantum dots, and X-ray
emission from accreting objects. For all three applications, the interpolation
was able to adequately describe the chaotic part of the experimental difference
moment, which implies that anomalous diffusion manifests itself in these
natural signals. The results of this study make it possible to broaden the
range of complex natural processes in which anomalous diffusion can be
identified. The relation between the interpolation expression and a diffusion
model, which is derived in the paper, allows one to simulate the chaotic
processes in the open complex systems with anomalous diffusion.

parsec-scale clumps of molecular clouds including protostellar outflow feedback
using Enzo-based MHD simulations with accreting sink particles and effective
resolution $2048^3$. We find that, in the absence of regulation by magnetic
fields and outflow feedback, massive stars form readily in a turbulent,
moderately condensed clump of $\sim 1,600$ solar masses, along with a cluster
of hundreds of lower mass stars. The massive stars are fed at high rates by (1)
transient dense filaments produced by large-scale turbulent compression at
early times, and (2) by the clump-wide global collapse resulting from
turbulence decay at late times. In both cases, the bulk of the massive star's
mass is supplied from outside a 0.1 pc-sized ""core"" that surrounds the star. In
our simulation, the massive star is clump-fed rather than core-fed. The need
for large-scale feeding makes the massive star formation prone to regulation by
outflow feedback, which directly opposes the feeding processes. The outflows
reduce the mass accretion rates onto the massive stars by breaking up the dense
filaments that feed the massive star formation at early times, and by
collectively slowing down the global collapse that fuel the massive star
formation at late times. The latter is aided by a moderate magnetic field of
strength in the observed range. We conclude that the massive star formation in
our simulated turbulent, magnetized, parsec-scale clump is outflow-regulated
and clump-fed (ORCF for short). An important implication is that the formation
of low-mass stars in a dense clump can affect the formation of massive stars in
the same clump, through their outflow feedback on the clump dynamics.

detailed parametric investigation reveals that the variation of the isotropic
rock material properties, especially its density, has no significant influence
on the largest principal stress. The influences of the depth of the hole and
the depth of the water column are also very small. On the other hand,
increasing the initial kinetic energy of the piston can dramatically increase
the largest principal stress and the best way to increase the initial kinetic
energy of the piston is to increase its initial velocity. Results from the
current dimensional analysis can be applied to optimize this non-explosive rock

In the implementation, accurate and efficient methods are developed especially
for evaluation of the density matrix and treatment of boundaries between the
scattering region and the leads. Equilibrium and nonequilibrium contributions
in the density matrix are evaluated with very high precision by a contour
integration with a continued fraction representation of the Fermi-Dirac

combination of the two dimensional fast Fourier transform (FFT) and a finite
difference method, and the charge density near the boundaries is constructed
with a careful treatment to avoid the spurious scattering at the boundaries.
The efficiency of the implementation is demonstrated by rapid convergence
properties of the density matrix. In addition, as an illustration, our method
is applied for zigzag graphene nanoribbons, a Fe/MgO/Fe tunneling junction, and
a LaMnO$_3/$SrMnO$_3$ superlattice, demonstrating its applicability to a wide

dust-forming stars and the subsequent gas-dust separation. At any value of

to the solar isotopic composition. Seven absorbers are characterized by low

be heavily processed due to coagulation, fragmentation and crystallization.
This paper focuses on the crystalline silicate dust grains in protoplanetary
disks. As part of the Cores to Disks Legacy Program, we obtained more than a
hundred Spitzer/IRS spectra of TTauri stars. More than 3/4 of our objects show
at least one crystalline silicate emission feature that can be essentially
attributed to Mg-rich silicates. Observational properties of the crystalline
features seen at lambda > 20 mu correlate with each other, while they are
largely uncorrelated with the properties of the amorphous silicate 10 mu
feature. This supports the idea that the IRS spectra essentially probe two
independent disk regions: a warm zone (< 1 AU) emitting at lambda ~ 10 mu and a
much colder region emitting at lambda > 20 mu (< 10 AU). We identify a
crystallinity paradox, as the long-wavelength crystalline silicate features are
3.5 times more frequently detected (~55 % vs. ~15%) than the crystalline
features arising from much warmer disk regions. This suggests that the disk has
an inhomogeneous dust composition within ~10 AU. The abundant crystalline
silicates found far from their presumed formation regions suggests efficient
outward radial transport mechanisms in the disks. The analysis of the shape and
strength of both the amorphous 10 mu feature and the crystalline feature around
23 mu provides evidence for the prevalence of micron-sized grains in upper
layers of disks. Their presence in disk atmospheres suggests efficient vertical
diffusion, likely accompanied by grain-grain fragmentation to balance the
efficient growth expected. Finally, the depletion of submicron-sized grains
points toward removal mechanisms such as stellar winds or radiation pressure.

evaluate statistical but not totally coherent stability of sunspot distribution
along latitudes as well as longitudes. The aim was to obtain information on the
longitudinal distribution of the underlying spot-generating mechanism rather
than on the distribution and migration of sunspots or sunspot groups on the
solar surface. Therefore only sunspot groups were included in the analysis, and
only the time of their first appearance was used. We use simple nonparametric
approach to reveal sunspot migration patterns and their persistency. Our
analysis shows that regions where spots are generated tend to rotate
differentially as the spots and spot groups themselves do. The activity areas,
however, tend to break down relatively fast, during 7-15 solar rotations. This
study provides a challenge for solar dynamo models, as our results are
consistent with the presence of a non-axisymmetric spot-generating mechanism
experiencing differential rotation (known as phase mixing in dynamo theory).
The new nonparametric method introduced here, completely independent of the
choice of the longitudinal distribution of sunspots, was found to be a very
powerful tool for spatio-temporal analysis of surface features.

analyze dark matter mass maps from weak lensing observations. The field of weak
lensing is motivated by the observations made in the last decades showing that
the visible matter represents only about 4-5% of the Universe, the rest being
dark. The Universe is now thought to be mostly composed by an invisible,
pressureless matter -potentially relic from higher energy theories- called
""dark matter"" (20-21%) and by an even more mysterious term, described in
Einstein equations as a vacuum energy density, called ""dark energy"" (70%). This
""dark"" Universe is not well described or even understood, so this point could
be the next breakthrough in cosmology. Weak gravitational lensing is believed
to be the most promising tool to understand the nature of dark matter and to
constrain the cosmological model used to describe the Universe. Gravitational
lensing is the process in which light from distant galaxies is bent by the
gravity of intervening mass in the Universe as it travels towards us. This
bending causes the image of background galaxies to appear slightly distorted
and can be used to extract significant results for cosmology. Future weak
lensing surveys are already planned in order to cover a large fraction of the
sky with large accuracy. However this increased accuracy also places greater
demands on the methods used to extract the available information. In this
paper, we will first describe the important steps of the weak lensing
processing to reconstruct the dark matter distribution from shear estimation.
Then we will discuss the problem of statistical estimation in order to set
constraints on the cosmological model. We review the methods which are
currently used especially new methods based on sparsity.

density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method. Employing both the
Hubbard--Ohno potential and the screened potential in one dimension, we
reproduce the experimental results for the binding energy of the singlet
exciton and its polarizability. Our results indicate that there are optically
dark states below the singlet exciton, in agreement with experiment. In
addition, we find a weakly bound second exciton with a binding energy of 0.1
eV. The energies in the triplet sector do not match the experimental data
quantitatively, probably because we do not include polaronic relaxation
effects.

investigate the temporal variation of the temperature and the size of the
emitting region associated with the superoutburst and short-term modulations,
such as early and ordinary superhumps. A hot (>11000 K) accretion disk suddenly
disappeared when the superoutburst finished, while blackbody emission, probably
from the disk, still remained dominant in the optical region with a moderately
high temperature (~8000 K). This indicates that a substantial amount of gas was
stored in the disk even after the outburst. This remnant matter may be a sign
of an expected mass-reservoir which can trigger echo outbursts observed in
several WZ Sge stars. The color variation associated with superhumps indicates
that viscous heating in a superhump source stopped on the way to the superhump
maximum, and a subsequent expansion of a low-temperature region made the
maximum. The color variation of early superhumps was totally different from
that of superhumps: the object was bluest at the early superhump minimum. The
temperature of the early superhump light source was lower than that of an
underlying component, indicating that the early superhump light source was a

interested in the asymptotic behavior of the normalized columns $P_nU_i/\Vert

main result in Theorem~A gives a sufficient condition ${\bf (C)}$ over the
sequence $A_1,A_2,\dots$ ensuring the existence of {\it dominant columns} of
$P_n$, having the same projective limit $V$: more precisely, for any rank $n$,
there exists a partition of $\{1,\dots,d\}$ made of two subsets
$J_n\ne\emptyset$ and $J_n^c$ such that each one of the sequences of normalized
columns, say $P_nU_{j_n}/\Vert P_nU_{j_n}\Vert$ with $j_n\in J_n$ tends to $V$

which information on the observed population can be recovered by the
distribution of the observed seismic constraints: the frequency of maximum
power of solar-like oscillations ($\nu_{max}$) and the large frequency
separation ($\Delta\nu$). We use the distribution of $\nu_{max}$ and of
$\Delta\nu$ observed by CoRoT in nearly 800 red giants in the first long
observational run, as a tool to investigate the properties of galactic
red-giant stars through the comparison with simulated distributions based on
synthetic stellar populations.
  We can clearly identify the bulk of the red giants observed by CoRoT as
red-clump stars, i.e. post-flash core-He-burning stars. The distribution of
$\nu_{max}$ and of $\Delta\nu$ give us access to the distribution of the
stellar radius and mass, and thus represent a most promising probe of the age
and star formation rate of the disk, and of the mass-loss rate during the
red-giant branch.
  This approach will be of great utility also in the interpretation of
forthcoming surveys of variability of red giants with CoRoT and Kepler. In
particular, an asteroseismic mass estimate of clump stars in the old-open
clusters observed by Kepler, would represent a most valuable observational test

by a month. Image-subtraction techniques were used to search for transient

was estimated by adding artificial stars to the subtracted images. Most of the
epochs reach 90% detection efficiency at SZ(J) ~= 23.8-24.0 mag (Vega). Two
transient objects, both in archival images of Abell 1689 and AC114, were
detected. The transient in AC114 coincides - within the position uncertainty -
with an X-ray source and is likely to be a variable AGN at the cluster
redshift. The transient in Abell 1689 was found at SZ=23.24 mag, ~0.5 arcsec
away from a galaxy with photometric redshift z=0.6 +/-0.15. The light curves
and the colors of the transient are consistent with a reddened Type IIP
supernova at redshift z=0.59 +/- 0.05. The lensing model of Abell 1689 predicts
~1.4 mag of magnification at the position of the transient, making it the most
magnified supernova ever found and only the second supernova found behind a

distant gravitationally magnified supernovae behind massive galaxy clusters.
One likely supernova was found behind Abell 1689, in accordance with the

flavour symmetry generically lead to bounds on new flavour structure many
orders of magnitude above the TeV-scale. The absence of Goldstone bosons for
discrete symmetries constitute the \emph{primary} motivation of our work. Less
symmetry implies further invariants and renders the mass flavour basis
transformation observable in principle and calls for a hierarchy in the Yukawa
matrix expansion. We show, through the dimension of the representations, that
the (discrete) symmetry in principle does allow for additional Delta F = 2
operators. If though the Delta F = 2 transitions are generated by two
subsequent Delta F = 1 processes, as for example in the Standard Model, then
the four crystal-like groups Sigma(168) ~ PSL(2,7), Sigma(72phi), Sigma(216phi)
and especially Sigma(360phi) do provide enough protection for a TeV-scale
discrete MFV scenario. Models where this is not the case have to be
investigated case by case. Interestingly Sigma(216phi) has a (non-faithful)
representation corresponding to an A4-symmetry. Moreover we argue that the,
apparently often omitted, (D)-groups are subgroups of an appropriate
Delta(6g^2). We would like to stress that we do not provide an actual model
that realizes the MFV scenario nor any other theory of flavour.

the detection of a significant number of SPB and $\beta$ Cep candidates. Since
the SMC is the metal poorest (Z$\approx$0.001-0.004) of the MCs, it constitutes
an interesting object for investigating the disagreement between theory and

the SMC compared with our local galactic environment, is it appropriate to
describe the chemical composition of SMC B stars by scaling the solar mixture
to lower $Z$? Is that composition uniform in space and time? In this paper we
present the results of a stability analysis of B-type stellar models computed

transfer is driven by time-dependent (Gaussian) coupling between the wells and
their relative detuning. The protocol successfully works in a wide range of
both repulsive and attractive BEC interaction. The nonlinear effects caused by
the interaction can be turned from detrimental into favorable for the
transport. The results are compared with familiar Landau-Zener scenarios using
the constant coupling. It is shown that the pulsed Gaussian coupling provides a

electron distribution provides terms that are well-known in the study of

familiar hexadecapole interaction. If the penetration of electrons into the
nucleus is taken into account, various corrections to these multipole
interactions appear. The best known one is a scalar correction related to the
isotope shift and the isomer shift. This paper discusses a related tensor
correction, which modifies the quadrupole interaction if electrons penetrate
the nucleus: the quadrupole shift. We describe the mathematical formalism and
provide first-principles calculations of the quadrupole shift for a large set
of solids. Fully relativistic calculations that explicitly take a finite
nucleus into account turn out to be mandatory. Our analysis shows that the
quadrupole shift becomes appreciably large for heavy elements. Implications for
experimental high-precision studies of quadrupole interactions and quadrupole

properties: scale-free behavior and modular organization, and it is natural and
important to study how these two features affect the dynamical processes taking
place on such networks. In this paper, we investigate a simple stochastic
process--trapping problem, a random walk with a perfect trap fixed at a given
location, performed on a family of hierarchical networks that exhibit
simultaneously striking scale-free and modular structure. We focus on a
particular case with the immobile trap positioned at the hub node having the
largest degree. Using a method based on generating functions, we determine
explicitly the mean first-passage time (MFPT) for the trapping problem, which
is the mean of the node-to-trap first-passage time over the entire network. The
exact expression for the MFPT is calculated through the recurrence relations
derived from the special construction of the hierarchical networks. The
obtained rigorous formula corroborated by extensive direct numerical
calculations exhibits that the MFPT grows algebraically with the network order.
Concretely, the MFPT increases as a power-law function of the number of nodes
with the exponent much less than 1. We demonstrate that the hierarchical
networks under consideration have more efficient structure for transport by
diffusion in contrast with other analytically soluble media including some
previously studied scale-free networks. We argue that the scale-free and
modular topologies are responsible for the high efficiency of the trapping
process on the hierarchical networks.

single-relay networks, and its performance is studied in the context of
communications over slow fading wireless channels. The proposed protocol is
based on a Decode or Quantize and Forward (DoQF) approach. In slow fading
scenarios, two performance metrics are relevant and complementary, namely the
outage probability gain and the Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff (DMT).
  First, we analyze the behavior of the outage probability P_o associated with
the proposed protocol as the SNR tends to infinity. In this case, we prove that
SNR^2 P_o converges to a constant. We refer to this constant as the outage gain
and we derive its closed-form expression for a general class of wireless
channels that includes the Rayleigh and the Rice channels as particular cases.
We furthermore prove that the DoQF protocol has the best achievable outage gain
in the wide class of half-duplex static relaying protocols. A method for
minimizing the outage gain with respect to the power distribution between the
source and the relay, and with respect to the durations of the slots is also
provided.
  Next, we focus on Rayleigh distributed fading channels to derive the DMT
associated with the proposed DoQF protocol. Our results show that the DMT of
DoQF achieves the 2 by 1 MISO upper-bound for multiplexing gains r < 0.25.

forming a broad structure in the angular distribution of the particles

descriptions of these phenomena, the hydrodynamic equations are linearized for

the non-linearities of the equations, which instead of simple waves may lead to
localized waves or even solitons.

geodesically complete Riemannian manifolds might imply that the manifold is
stochastically complete. This is motivated by a large class of examples and by
a known analogous criterion for recurrence of Brownian motion. We show that the
suggested implication is not true in general. We also give counter-examples to
a converse implication.

two-dimensional quantum gravity in the framework of causal dynamical
triangulations can be viewed as arising through a stochastic quantization. This
requires that the proper time appearing in the string field theory be
identified with the stochastic time of the stochastic formulation. The
framework of stochastic quantization gives rise to a natural nonperturbative
quantum Hamiltonian, which incorporates a sum over all spacetime topologies. We
point out that the external character of stochastic time is a feature that
pertains more generally to the proper time or distance appearing in
nonperturbative correlation functions in quantum gravity.

spatially heterogeneous dynamics, with localized regions where many particles
are strongly rearranging by these measures. We examine the shapes of these

particular direction. Furthermore, individual particles are equally likely to
move in any direction, other than the overall bias imposed by the strain.

conductivity and mobility of graphene ribbons using the Landauer formalism and
the tight-binding p-orbital Hamiltonian. We demonstrate that as the length of
the structure increases the system undergoes a transition from the ballistic to
the diffusive regime. This is reflected in the calculated electron density
dependencies of the conductivity and the mobility. In particular, we show that
the mobility of graphene ribbons varies as mu(n) n^(-lambda), with
0<lambda<0.5. The exponent lambda depends on the length of the system with
lambda=0.5 corresponding to short structures in the ballistic regime, whereas
the diffusive regime lambda=0 (when the mobility is independent on the electron
density) is reached for sufficiently long structures. Our results can be used
for the interpretation of experimental data when the value of lambda can be
used to distinguish the transport regime of the system (i.e. ballistic,
quasi-ballistic or diffusive). Based on our findings we discuss available
experimental results.

the sustainability of modern society. Nuclear fusion of the hydrogen isotopes
deuterium and tritium, if successful, might make a major contribution toward
satisfying this need. The U.S. has an important effort aimed at achieving
practical inertial confinement fusion, ICF, which has been under development
for decades at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The National
Ignition Facility (NIF) is a giant laser to multiply-shock and thus
quasi-isentropically compress a capsule of deuterium-tritium (DT) to high
density and temperature, where the fusion rate is proportional to density
squared times temperature to the fourth power. The principal problem that must
be solved for NIF to work successfully is elimination of the Rayleigh-Tailor
(R-T) instability that originates from the interface between the solid shell
and the DT fuel within it. The R-T instability poisons the fusion reaction by
reducing the temperature of the DT achieved by dynamic compression driven by
the NIF laser. The primary technological problem today is one of Condensed
Matter and Materials Physics (CMMP), rather than laser technology and plasma
physics. The CMMP of the fuel capsule that must be done to minimize growth of
the R-T instability is yet to be done. Based on what is known today, it is
unlikely that NIF will produce practical amounts of fusion energy.

fraction of late-type galaxies provides evidence for unexpectedly large-scale
disk building at recent epochs. Combining GALEX UV observations with deep
optical and Spitzer IR imaging, we search for XUV disks in a sample of nearby
low-to-intermediate mass E/S0 galaxies to explore evidence for disk rebuilding
after mergers. Preliminary visual classification yields ten XUV-disk candidates
from the full sample of 30, intriguingly similar to the ~30% frequency for
late-type galaxies. These XUV candidates occur at a wide range of masses and on
both the red and blue sequences in color vs. stellar mass, indicating a
possible association with processes like gas accretion and/or galaxy
interactions that would affect the galaxy population broadly. We go on to apply
the quantitative Type 1 and Type 2 XUV-disk definitions to a nine-galaxy
subsample analyzed in detail. For this subsample, six of the nine are Type 1
XUVs, i.e., galaxies with UV structure beyond the expected star formation
threshold. The other three come close to satisfying the Type 2 definition, but
that definition proves problematic to apply to this sample: the NUV-derived
star formation threshold radii for our E/S0s often lie inside the 80% Ks-band
light (K80) radii, violating an implicit assumption of the Type 2 definition,
or lie outside but not as far as the definition requires. Nonetheless, the
three otherwise Type 2-like galaxies (""modified Type 2 XUVs"") have higher star
formation rates and bluer FUV - NUV colors than the Type 1 XUVs in the sample.
We propose that Type 1 XUVs may reflect early or inefficient stages of star
formation, while modified Type 2 XUVs perhaps reflect inside-out disk regrowth.
