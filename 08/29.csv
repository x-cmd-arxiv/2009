simulations of weakly compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence
(``Alfvenic turbulence''); these results are relevant to particle heating and
acceleration in the solar wind, solar flares, accretion disks onto black holes,
and other astrophysics and heliospheric environments. The physics of particle
heating depends on whether the gyrofrequency of a particle is comparable to the
frequency of a turbulent fluctuation that is resolved on the computational
domain. Particles with these frequencies nearly equal undergo strong
perpendicular heating (relative to the local magnetic field) and pitch angle
scattering. By contrast, particles with large gyrofrequency undergo strong
parallel heating. Simulations with a finite resistivity produce additional
parallel heating due to parallel electric fields in small-scale current sheets.
Many of our results are consistent with linear theory predictions for the
particle heating produced by the Alfven and slow magnetosonic waves that make
up Alfvenic turbulence. However, in contrast to linear theory predictions,
energy exchange is not dominated by discrete resonances between particles and
waves; instead, the resonances are substantially ``broadened.'' We discuss the
implications of our results for solar and astrophysics problems, in particular
the thermodynamics of the near-Earth solar wind. We conclude that Alfvenic
turbulence produces significant parallel heating via the interaction between
particles and magnetic field compressions (``slow waves''). However, on scales
above the proton Larmor radius, Alfvenic turbulence does not produce
significant perpendicular heating of protons or minor ions.

exemplify a target with $N^2\sim1$, we calculate radiation from electron
incident at a small angle on an atomic row in oriented crystal. Radiation
intensity and polarization dependence on the emission angle and frequency for
constant $\bm N$ is investigated. Net polarization for the angle-integral
cross-section is evaluated, which appears to be proportional to $N^2/2$, and
decreases with the increase of the photon energy fraction. A prominent feature
of the radiation angular distribution is the existence of an angle at which the
radiation may be completely polarized, in spite of the target complete or
partial isotropy -- that owes to existence of an origin-centered tangential
circle for polarization in the fully differential radiation probability kernel.
Possibilities for utilizing various properties of the polarized bremsstrahlung
flux for preparation of polarized photon beams and for probing intrinsic
anisotropy of the medium are analyzed.

interpretation of Mach principle and an Unruh like effect, in the context of a
generalized equivalence principle. It is argued that in a locally accelerated
frame with acceleration $a$ the appearance of a Rindler horizon may give rise
to a constant acceleration $a_0$ as the local properties of cosmological
horizon or Hubble length. The total gravitational acceleration inside this
frame becomes the combination of $a$ with $a_0$. For $a\gg a_0$, the
conventional gravitational mass $m_g$ interacts with the dominant acceleration
as $m_g a$ and application of Sciama's interpretation leads to the standard
Newtonian dynamics. For $a\ll a_0$, however, a reduced gravitational mass
$\bar{m}_g$ interacts with the dominant acceleration as $\bar{m}_g a_0$ and the
application of Sciama's interpretation on this reduced gravitational mass leads
to MOND. This introduces a third proposal for MOND: {\it The modification of

the properties of cold matter beyond nuclear density. Beginning in the late
1970s it was proposed that the radius could be obtained from the apparent or
inferred emitting area during the decay portions of thermonuclear (type I)
X-ray bursts. However, this apparent area is generally not constant, preventing
reliable measurement of the source radius. Here we report for the first time a
correlation between the variation of the inferred area and the burst
properties, measured in a sample of almost 900 bursts from 43 sources. We found
that the rate of change of the inferred area during decay is anticorrelated
with the burst decay duration. A Spearman rank correlation test shows that this
relation is significant at the <10^{-45} level for our entire sample, and at
the 7x10^{-37} level for the 625 bursts without photospheric radius expansion.
This anticorrelation is also highly significant for individual sources
exhibiting a wide range of burst durations, such as 4U 1636-536 and Aql X-1. We
suggest that variations in the colour factor, which relates the colour
temperature resulted from the scattering in the neutron star atmosphere to the
effective temperature of the burning layer, may explain the correlation. This
in turn implies significant variations in the composition of the atmosphere
between bursts with long and short durations.

2-point correlation function, w(\theta). We obtain the first measurement of
clustering at the low frequencies relevant to 21 cm tomography. We find that a
single power law with shape w(\theta) = A \theta^{-\gamma} fits well the data.
For a galactic cut of 10 degrees, with a data cut of \delta less than -10
degrees, and a flux limit of S = 770 mJy, we obtain a slope of \gamma = (-1.2
+/- 0.35). This value of \gamma is consistent with that measured from other
radio catalogues at the millimeter wavelengths. The amplitude of clustering has
a length of 0.2 degrees - 0.6 degrees, and it is independent of the
flux-density threshold.

equation emerges as an exact result of imposing the Dirac algebra, the criteria

However, relaxing the constraint that in particular the mass matrix be
Hermitian also allows for models that have no counterpart in conventional
quantum mechanics. For example it is well-known that a quartet of Weyl spinors
coupled by a Hermitian mass matrix reduces to two independent Dirac fermions;
here we show that the same quartet of Weyl spinors, when coupled by a
non-Hermitian but $\cal{PT}$ symmetric mass matrix, describes a single
relativistic particle that can have massless dispersion relation even though
the mass matrix is non-zero.The ${\cal PT}$-generalized Dirac equation is also
Lorentz invariant, unitary in time, and CPT respecting, even though as a
non-interacting theory it violates ${\cal P}$ and ${\cal T}$ individually. The
relativistic wave equations are reformulated as canonical fermionic field
theories to facilitate the study of interactions, and are shown to maintain
many of the canonical structures from Hermitian field theory, but with new and
interesting new possibilities permitted by the non-hermiticity parameter $m_2$.

endemic to pure AMSB scenarios. In HCAMSB, one obtains a mass ordering M_1>\mu
>M_2 with split left- and right- scalars, whereas in mAMSB models, one obtains
\mu >M_1>M_2 with nearly degenerate left- and right-scalars. We compute the
allowed parameter space and expected superparticle mass spectrum in the HCAMSB
model. For low values of the HC and AMSB mixing parameter \alpha, the spectra
is characterized by light left-sleptons, while the spectra for large \alpha is
characterized by light top- and bottom- squarks. We map out the approximate
reach of LHC for HCAMSB, and find that with 100 fb^{-1} of integrated
luminosity, a gravitino mass of \sim 115 (105) TeV can be probed for low (high)
values of \alpha, corresponding to a gluino mass reach of \sim 2.4 (2.2) TeV.

should yield visible highly ionizing tracks in the LHC detector. Also, in the
lower \tan\beta range, HCAMSB models give rise to reconstructable Z\to

starburst outflows (in contrast to the high-ionization wind fluid observed in
X-rays), based on new Keck/LRIS spectroscopy of partially resolved absorption
troughs in near-ultraviolet and optical spectra of Ultraluminous Infrared
Galaxies. The large velocity width and blueshift present in seven, atomic
transitions indicate a macroscopic velocity gradient within the outflowing gas.
The \mgII 2796, 2803 (and \feII 2587, 2600) doublet lines in these data
constrains the gas kinematics better than the heavily blended \nad 5892, 98
doublet. The identical shape of the \mgII 2796 absorption troughs to that of
the normally weaker transition at 2803\AA requires both transitions be
optically thick at all outflow velocities. The fraction of the galactic
continuum covered by the outflow at each velocity therefore dictates the shape
of these absorption troughs. We suggest that the velocity offset of the deepest
part of the troughs, where the covering factor of low-ionization gas is near
unity, reflects the speed of a shell of swept-up, interstellar gas at the time
of blowout. In a spherical outflow, we show that the fragments of this shell
expand slowly relative to the geometrical dilution; and the covering fraction
of low-ionization gas decreases with increasing radius. Our measurement of a
covering factor that decreases with increasing velocity can therefore be
interpreted as evidence that the low-ionization outflow is accelerating. We
also present measurements of C_f(v) in 4 species, place an upper limit of 3000
cm3 on the density of the outflowing gas, and discuss lower limits on the mass
outflow rate.

2005) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II (SDSS-II) Supernova Survey. These data
fill in the redshift ""desert"" between low- and high-redshift SN Ia surveys. We
combine the SDSS-II measurements with new distance estimates for published SN
data from the ESSENCE survey, the Supernova Legacy Survey, the Hubble Space

Hubble diagram with measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from the SDSS
Luminous Red Galaxy sample and with CMB temperature anisotropy measurements
from WMAP, we estimate the cosmological parameters w and Omega_M, assuming a
spatially flat cosmological model (FwCDM) with constant dark energy equation of
state parameter, w. For the FwCDM model and the combined sample of 288 SNe Ia,
we find w = -0.76 +- 0.07(stat) +- 0.11(syst), Omega_M = 0.306 +- 0.019(stat)
+- 0.023(syst) using MLCS2k2 and w = -0.96 +- 0.06(stat) +- 0.12(syst), Omega_M

discrepancy between these results to a difference in the rest-frame UV model
combined with a different luminosity correction from color variations; these
differences mostly affect the distance estimates for the SNLS and HST
supernovae. We present detailed discussions of systematic errors for both
light-curve methods and find that they both show data-model discrepancies in
rest-frame $U$-band. For the SALT-II approach, we also see strong evidence for
redshift-dependence of the color-luminosity parameter (beta). Restricting the
analysis to the 136 SNe Ia in the Nearby+SDSS-II samples, we find much better
agreement between the two analysis methods but with larger uncertainties.

those found in HII galaxies, which have a much lower metallicity. The fact that
their ionization structure and the temperature of their ionizing radiation

Despite the importance of edge direction for detecting local and community

in networks: the tendency of nodes with similar numbers of edges to connect.
This tendency, called assortativity, affects crucial structural and dynamic
properties of real-world networks, such as error tolerance or epidemic
spreading. Here we demonstrate that edge direction has profound effects on
assortativity. We define a set of four directed assortativity measures and
assign statistical significance by comparison to randomized networks. We apply
these measures to three network classes---online/social networks, food webs,
and word-adjacency networks. Our measures (i) reveal patterns common to each
class, (ii) separate networks that have been previously classified together,
and (iii) expose limitations of several existing theoretical models. We reject
the standard classification of directed networks as purely assortative or
disassortative. Many display a class-specific mixture, likely reflecting
functional or historical constraints, contingencies, and forces guiding the
system's evolution.

operations. Response problems are projected as a combination of failure in
communication, failure in technology, failure in methodology, failure of
management, and finally failure of observation. In this paper we compare eight
crisis response systems namely: DrillSim [2, 13], DEFACTO [12, 17], ALADDIN [1,
6], RoboCup Rescue [11, 15], FireGrid [3, 8, 18], WIPER [16], D-AESOP [4], and
PLAN C [14]. Comparison results will disclose the cause of failure of current
crisis response operations (the response gap). Based on comparison results; we
provide recommendations for bridging this gap between response operations and
systems.

sufficiently fast at spatial infinity. Moreover, if the perturbations are
initially static (i.e., their time derivative is zero), then the decay is

$t^{-2\ell-3}$. The proof is based on an integral representation of the

different perturbative arguments in order to construct the corresponding

Center (GC). We compare the properties of 1159 X-ray point sources discovered
in our deep (100 ks) Chandra observations of three low extinction Window fields
near the GC with the X-ray sources in the other GB fields centered around Sgr
B2, Sgr C, the Arches Cluster and Sgr A* using Chandra archival data. To reduce
the systematic errors induced by the uncertain X-ray spectra of the sources
coupled with field-and-distance dependent extinction, we classify the X-ray
sources using quantile analysis and estimate their fluxes accordingly. The
result indicates the GB X-ray population is highly concentrated at the center,
more heavily than the stellar distribution models. We also compare the total
X-ray and infrared surface brightness using the Chandra and Spitzer
observations of the regions. The radial distribution of the total infrared
surface brightness from the 3.6 band $\mu$m images appears to resemble the
radial distribution of the X-ray point sources better than predicted by the
stellar distribution models. Assuming a simple power law model for the X-ray
spectra, the closer to the GC the intrinsically harder the X-ray spectra
appear, but adding an iron emission line at 6.7 keV in the model allows the
spectra of the GB X-ray sources to be largely consistent across the region.
This implies that the majority of these GB X-ray sources can be of the same or
similar type. Their X-ray luminosity and spectral properties support the idea
that the most likely candidate is magnetic cataclysmic variables (CVs),
primarily intermediate polars (IPs). Their observed number density is also
consistent with the majority being IPs.

It is found that bulge properties, effective radius, effective surface
brightness, and also absolute magnitude, change systematically with the
morphological sequence; from early to late types, the size becomes somewhat
larger, and surface brightness and luminosity fainter. In contrast disks are
nearly universal, their properties remaining similar among disk galaxies
irrespective of detailed morphologies from S0 to Sc. While these tendencies
were often discussed in previous studies, the present study confirms them based
on a large homogeneous magnitude-limited field galaxy sample with morphological
types estimated. The systematic change of bulge-to-total luminosity ratio,
$B/T$, along the morphological sequence is therefore not caused by disks but
mostly by bulges. It is also shown that elliptical galaxies and bulges of
spiral galaxies are unlikely to be in a single sequence. We infer the stellar
mass density (in units of the critical mass density) to be $\Omega=$0.0021 for
spheroids, i.e., elliptical galaxies plus bulges of spiral galaxies, and
$\Omega=$0.00081 for disks.

We investigate the ortho-water abundance in outflows and shocks in
order to improve our knowledge of shock chemistry and of the physics behind
molecular outflows. Methods. We have used the Odin space observatory to observe
the H2O(110-101) line. We obtain strip maps and single pointings of 13 outflows
and two supernova remnants where we report detections for eight sources. We
have used RADEX to compute the beam averaged abundances of o-H2O relative to
H2. In the case of non-detection, we derive upper limits on the abundance.
Results. Observations of CO emission from the literature show that the volume
density of H2 can vary to a large extent, a parameter that puts severe
uncertainties on the derived abundances. Our analysis shows a wide range of
abundances reflecting the degree to which shock chemistry is affecting the
formation and destruction of water. We also compare our results with recent
results from the SWAS team. Conclusions. Elevated abundances of ortho-water are
found in several sources. The abundance reaches values as high as what would be
expected from a theoretical C-type shock where all oxygen, not in the form of
CO, is converted to water. However, the high abundances we derive could also be
due to the low densities (derived from CO observations) that we assume. The
water emission may in reality stem from high density regions much smaller than
the Odin beam. We do not find any relationship between the abundance and the
mass loss rate. On the other hand, there is a relation between the derived
water abundance and the observed maximum outflow velocity.

experiments and simulations of Rayleigh-Benard convection in a water-filled
cylinder whose radius is twice the height. We have adapted a time-dependent
pseudospectral code, first, to carry out Newton's method and branch
continuation and, second, to carry out the exponential power method and Arnoldi
iteration to calculate leading eigenpairs and determine the stability of the
steady states. The resulting bifurcation diagram represents a compromise
between the tendency in the bulk towards parallel rolls, and the requirement
imposed by the boundary conditions that primary bifurcations be towards states
whose azimuthal dependence is trigonometric. The diagram contains 17 branches
of stable and unstable steady states. These can be classified geometrically as
roll states containing two, three, and four rolls; axisymmetric patterns with
one or two tori; three-fold symmetric patterns called mercedes, mitubishi,
marigold and cloverleaf; trigonometric patterns called dipole and pizza; and
less symmetric patterns called CO and asymmetric three-rolls. The convective
branches are connected to the conductive state and to each other by 16 primary
and secondary pitchfork bifurcations and turning points. In order to better
understand this complicated bifurcation diagram, we have partitioned it
according to azimuthal symmetry. We have been able to determine the
bifurcation-theoretic origin from the conductive state of all the branches
observed at high Rayleigh number.
