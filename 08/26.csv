between the Sun and two collections of `solar twins' are discussed. The
differences can be understood as an imprint on the abundances of the solar
convection zone caused by the lock-up of heavy elements in the planets. Such a
scenario also leads naturally to possible solutions of two other abundance
peculiarities; 1) the discrepancy between photospheric abundances derived from
accurate 3-D models of the solar photosphere and the abundance of heavy
elements in the solar interior deduced from helioseismology, and 2) the
abundance pattern of Jupiter, which can either--with great difficulty--be
interpreted as a general and similar overabundance of both common elements such
as carbon, nitrogen and sulphur and rare inert gases such as argon, krypton and
xenon, or--much more simply--as an under-abundance of hydrogen.

We focus on the early Class I stage of stellar evolution when circumstellar
disks are exposed to high rates of mass deposition from infalling envelopes.
Our numerical modeling reproduces the large observed spread in accretion rates
inferred for embedded YSOs in Perseus, Serpens, and Ophiuchus star forming
regions by Enoch et al. (2009), yielding 37%--75% of objects with ""sub-Shu""
accretion rates \dot{M} \la 10^{-6} Msun/yr and 1%--2% of objects with
""super-Shu"" accretion rates \dot{M}>10^{-5} Msun/yr. Mass accretion rates in
the Class I stage have a log-normal distribution, with its shape controlled by
disk viscosity and disk temperature. The spread in $\dot{M}$ is greater in
models with lower viscosity and smaller in models with higher viscosity and
higher disk temperature, suggesting that gravitational instability may be a
dominant cause of the observed diversity in $\dot{M}$ in embedded YSOs. Our
modeling predicts a weak dependence between the mean mass accretion rates and
stellar masses in the Class I stage, in sharp contrast to the corresponding
steep dependence for evolved T Tauri stars and brown dwarfs.

good examples of language constructs promoting modular programming. Among the
three, mixins can be thought of as a generalization of the two others in the
sense that mixins can incorporate features of ML modules and objects with a set
of primitive operators with clean semantics. Much work has been devoted to
build mixin-based module systems for practical programming languages. In
respect of the operational semantics, previous work notably investigated mixin
calculi in call-by-name and call-by-value evaluation settings. In this paper we
examine a mixin calculus in a call-by-need, or lazy, evaluation setting. We
demonstrate how lazy mixins can be interesting in practice with a series of
examples, and formalize the operational semantics by adapting Ancona and
Zucca's concise formalization of call-by-name mixins. We then extend the
semantics with constraints to control the evaluation order of components of
mixins in several ways. The main motivation for considering the constraints is
to produce side effects in a more explicit order than in a purely lazy,
demand-driven setting. We explore the design space of possibly interesting
constraints and consider two examples in detail.

with a limited field of view ""phi"" for navigation. An agent drives forward at a
constant velocity and uses the sensor to turn right when it is too close to an
object and left when it is too far away.
  For a flat wall the agent stays a fixed distance from the wall and travels
along it, regardless of the sensor's capabilities. But, if the wall represents
a periodic function, the agent drives on a periodic path when the sensor has a
narrow field of view. The agent's trajectory transitions to chaos when the
sensor's field of view is increased. Numerical experiments were performed with
square, triangle, and sawtooth waves for the wall, to find this pattern. The
bifurcations of the agents were analyzed, finding both border collision and

computation from first principles is difficult, it is desirable to try to
extract it from experimental data. Viscous hydrodynamics provides a tool that
can attack this problem and which may work in regions where ideal hydrodynamics
begins to fail.
  This thesis focuses on viscous hydrodynamics for relativistic heavy ion
collisions. We first review the 2nd order viscous equations obtained from
different approaches, and then report on the work of the Ohio State University
group on setting up the equations for causal viscous hydrodynamics in 2+1
dimensions and solving them numerically for central and noncentral Cu+Cu and
Au+Au collisions at RHIC energies and above. We discuss shear and bulk viscous
effects on the hydrodynamic evolution of entropy density, temperature,
collective flow, and flow anisotropies, and on the hadron multiplicity, single
particle spectra and elliptic flow. Viscous entropy production and its
influence on the centrality dependence of hadron multiplicities and the
multiplicity scaling of eccentricity-scaled elliptic flow are studied in
viscous hydrodynamics and compared with experimental data. The dynamical
effects of using different versions of the Israel-Stewart second order
formalism for causal viscous fluid dynamics are discussed, resolving some of
the apparent discrepancies between early results reported by different groups.
Finally, we assess the present status of constraining the shear viscosity to
entropy ratio of the hot and dense matter created at RHIC.

analytic properties of the automorphic $L$-functions attached to $\tau$. We
study the automorphic forms $\Phi_{i}^{(b)}$ obtained as residues at the points
$s_i^{(b)}$ (defined precisely in the paper) by calculating their cuspidal
exponents in certain cases. In the case of the ""endpoint"" $s_0^{(b)}$ and

cases where there are at least two massive partons involved in the scattering

et al. 2006) in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Specifically, we use the
halo occupation distribution (HOD) formalism to model the projected two-point
correlation function of LRGs on scales well within the sizes of their host
halos (0.016 Mpc/h < r < 0.42 Mpc/h). We start by varying P(N|M), the
probability distribution that a dark matter halo of mass M contains N LRGs, and
assuming that the radial distribution of satellite LRGs within halos traces the
NFW dark matter density profile. We find that varying P(N|M) alone is not
sufficient to match the small-scale data. We next allow the concentration of
satellite LRG galaxies to differ from that of dark matter and find that this is
also not sufficient. Finally, we relax the assumption of an NFW profile and
allow the inner slope of the density profile to vary. We find that this model
provides a good fit to the data and the resulting value of the slope is -2.17
+/- 0.12. The radial density profile of satellite LRGs within halos is thus not
compatible with that of the underlying dark matter, but rather is closer to an
isothermal distribution.

Cosmic string networks form during phase transistions in the early universe and
these networks of long cosmic strings break into loops that radiate energy in
the form of gravitational waves until they decay. The gravitational waves come
in the form of harmonic modes from individual string loops, a ""confusion noise""
from galactic loops, and a stochastic background of gravitational waves from a
network of loops. In this study string loops of larger size $\alpha$ and lower
string tensions $G\mu$ (where $\mu$ is the mass per unit length of the string)
are investigated than in previous studies. Several detectors are currently
searching for gravitational waves and a space based satellite, the Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), is in the final stages of pre-flight. The
results for large loop sizes ($\alpha=0.1$) put an upper limit of about
$G\mu<10^{-9}$ and indicate that gravitational waves from string loops down to
$G\mu \approx 10^{-20}$ could be detectabe by LISA. The string tension is
related to the energy scale of the phase transition and the Planck mass via
$G\mu = \Lambda_s^2 / m_{pl}^2$, so the limits on $G\mu$ set the energy scale
of any phase transition to $\Lambda_s < 10^{-4.5} m_{pl}$. Our results indicate
that loops may form a significant gravitational wave signal, even for string
tensions too low to have larger cosmological effects.

equivalent width Wr being produced by a halo of mass M_h at a given redshift,
P(Wr|M_h,z). We constrain the free parameters of the model by matching the
observed statistics of MgII absorbers: the frequency function f(Wr), the
redshift evolution n(z), and the clustering bias b(Wr). The redshift evolution
of Wr>1 A absorbers increases from z=0.4 to z=2, while the total halo cross
section decreases monotonically with redshift. This discrepancy can only be
explained if the gaseous halos evolve with respect to their host halos. We make
predictions for the clustering bias of absorbers as a function of redshift
under different evolutionary scenarios, eg, the gas cross section per halo
evolves or the halo mass scale of absorbers changes. We demonstrate that the
relative contribution of these scenarios may be constrained by measurements of
absorber clustering at z>1 and z~0.1. If we further assume a
redshift-independent mass scale for efficient shock heating of halo gas of
Mcrit = 10^{11.5} Msol/h, absorber evolution is predominantly caused by a
changing halo mass scale of absorbers. Our model predicts that strong absorbers
always arise in ~Mcrit halos, independent of redshift, but the mass scale of
weak absorbers decreases by 2 dex from 0<z<2. Thus, the measured
anti-correlation of clustering bias and Wr should flatten by z~1.5.

of family replication in the sense that models for the electroweak interaction
can be constructed so that anomaly cancellation is achieved by an interplay
between generations, all of them under the condition that the number of
families must be divisible by the number of colours of SU(3)_c. This method of
anomaly cancellation requires a family of quarks transforming differently from
the other two, thus leading to tree-level flavour changing neutral currents
(FCNC) transmitted by the two extra neutral gauge bosons $Z'$ and $Z''$
predicted by the model. In a version of the 3-4-1 extension, which does not
contain particles with exotic electric charges, we study the fermion mass
spectrum and some aspects of the phenomenology of the neutral gauge boson
sector. In particular, we impose limits on the $Z-Z'$ mixing angle and on the
mass scale of the corresponding physical new neutral gauge boson $Z_2$, and
establish a lower bound on the mass of the additional new neutral gauge boson
$Z'' \equiv Z_3$. For the analysis we use updated precision electroweak data at

violation data. The mass scale of the additional new neutral gauge boson $Z_3$
is constrained by using updated experimental inputs from neutral meson mixing
in the analysis of the sources of FCNC in the model. The data constrain the
$Z-Z'$ mixing angle to a very small value of O(0.001), and the lower bounds on

most natural variant of Stanley depth from $\llbracket S_k\rrbracket$ -- the
poset of nonempty subsets of $\{1,2,\dots,k\}$ ordered by inclusion -- to any

nonempty submultisets of a multiset ordered by inclusion, which corresponds to
a product of chains with the bottom element deleted. We show that the total
depth agrees with Stanley depth for $\llbracket S_k\rrbracket$ but not for such
posets in general. We also prove that the total depth of the product of chains
$\bm{n}^k$ with the bottom element deleted is $(n-1)\lceil{k/2}\rceil$, which
generalizes a result of Bir{\'{o}}, Howard, Keller, Trotter, and Young (2010).
Further, we provide upper and lower bounds for a general multiset and find the
total depth for any multiset with at most five distinct elements. In addition,

studied using two-dimensional two-fluid magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We
consider the situation of converging, supersonic flows of warm neutral medium
in the interstellar medium that generate a shocked slab of thermally unstable
gas in which clouds form. We found, as speculated in paper I, that in the
shocked slab magnetic pressure dominates thermal pressure and the thermal
instability grows in the isochorically cooling, thermally unstable slab that
leads formation of HI clouds whose number density is typically n < 100 cm^-3,
even if the angle between magnetic field and converging flows is small. We also
found that even if there is a large dispersion of magnetic field, evolution of
the shocked slab is essentially determined by the angle between the mean
magnetic field and converging flows. Thus, the direct formation of molecular
clouds by piling up warm neutral medium does not seem a typical molecular cloud
formation process, unless the direction of supersonic converging flows is
biased to the orientation of mean magnetic field by some mechanism. However,
when the angle is small, the HI shell generated as a result of converging flows
is massive and possibly evolves into molecular clouds, provided gas in the
massive HI shell is piled up again along the magnetic field line. We expect
that another subsequent shock wave can pile up again the gas of the massive
shell and produce a larger cloud. We thus emphasize the importance of multiple
episodes of converging flows, as a typical formation process of molecular
clouds.

high quality observations and GAIA synthetic spectra, we estimate the companion
effective temperature to Teff = 2400 +/- 100 K, its gravity to log g = 4.0 +/-

predictions of the DUSTY evolutionary tracks allow us to constrain the mass of
GQ Lup b to 8 - 60 MJup, most likely in the brown dwarf regime. Compared with
the spectra published by Seifahrt and collaborators, our spectra of GQ Lup b
are significantly redder (by 15 - 50%) and do not show important Pa\beta

was studied by a microrheological technique using an optical tweezer to trap

sinusoidally drive it in-planeThe sticking process was well-described by a
crossover of the mechanical coupling between the plate and the particle from
being dominantly viscous to becoming dominantly elastic. By varying three
parameters in the experiment, namely, the strength of the tweezer potential,
the strength of the particle-plate interaction and the strength of the
oscillatory drive, three different regimes of dynamics - stuck, non-stuck and
ageing were observed, corresponding to the coupling that is elastic, viscous

better by a parametric Nyquist plot of the real and imaginary parts of the
effective rigidity modulus of the coupling medium. Upon contact between the
particle and the plate, these parameters change abruptly from their bulk
values, regardless of whether the particle is stuck or non-stuck in the
terminal steady state. In the ageing regime, where sticking evolves gradually
in time, the system shows a parametric plot significantly different from what
would be expected from a single-relaxation process. A tendency of clustering of
the data in the Nyquist plot provides an interesting contrast between truly

  Moreover, it can cause transitions from laminar current flow to vortices, and
also change the chirality of the vortex. The magnetic behavior of these devices
is also very peculiar. Those nano-circuits which consist of an odd number of
atoms behave in a fundamentally different manner compared to those which
consist of an even number of atoms. The circuits having an odd number of sites
connected to long enough symmetric wires are diamagnetic; they display
half-fluxon periodicity induced by many-body symmetry even in the absence of
electron-phonon and electron-electron interactions. In principle one can
operate a new kind of quantum interference device without superconductors.
Since there is no gap and no critical temperature, one predicts qualitatively
the same behavior at and above room temperature, although with a reduced

model describing the evolution of a large-amplitude coronal wave emitted by the
expansion of a circular source surface in order to mimic the evolution of a
Moreton wave. The model results are confronted with observations of a strong
Moreton wave observed in association with the X3.8/3B flare/CME event from
January 17, 2005. Using different input parameters for the expansion of the
source region, either derived from the real CME observations (assuming that the
upward moving CME drives the wave), or synthetically generated scenarios
(expanding flare region, lateral expansion of the CME flanks), we calculate the
kinematics of the associated Moreton wave signature. Those model input
parameters are determined which fit the observed Moreton wave kinematics best.
Using the measured kinematics of the upward moving CME as the model input, we
are not able to reproduce the observed Moreton wave kinematics. The
observations of the Moreton wave can be reproduced only by applying a strong
and impulsive acceleration for the source region expansion acting in a piston
mechanism scenario. Based on these results we propose that the expansion of the
flaring region or the lateral expansion of the CME flanks is more likely the

disorder is taken into account via the appropriate generalization of the

is practically independent of the strength of Hubbard correlations. However,
the divergence of localization length in finite size two-dimensional system at
small disorder signifies the existence of an effective Anderson transition.

commutator is reviewed, as is the threat of self-inconsistent overdetermination
of the quantization of classical dynamical variables which drove him to
restrict the assumption of correspondence between quantum and classical Poisson
brackets to embrace only the Cartesian components of the phase space vector.
Dirac's canonical commutation rule fails to determine the order of noncommuting
factors within quantized classical dynamical variables, but does imply the
quantum/classical correspondence of Poisson brackets between any linear
function of phase space and the sum of an arbitrary function of only
configuration space with one of only momentum space. Since every linear
function of phase space is itself such a sum, it is worth checking whether the
assumption of quantum/classical correspondence of Poisson brackets for all such
sums is still self-consistent. Not only is that so, but this slightly stronger
canonical commutation rule also unambiguously determines the order of
noncommuting factors within quantized dynamical variables in accord with the
1925 Born-Jordan quantization surmise, thus replicating the results of the
Hamiltonian path integral, a fact first realized by E. H. Kerner. Born-Jordan
quantization validates the generalized Ehrenfest theorem, but has no inverse,
which disallows the disturbing features of the poorly physically motivated
invertible Weyl quantization, i.e., its unique deterministic classical ""shadow

statistical mechanics by which the evolution of velocity fluctuations of the
Brownian particle under a fluctuating environment is intimately related to its
dissipative behavior. This can be illuminated in particular by an example of
Brownian motion in an ohmic environment where the dissipative effect can be
accounted for by the first-order time derivative of the position. Here we
explore the dynamics of the Brownian particle coupled to a supraohmic
environment by considering the motion of a charged particle interacting with
the electromagnetic fluctuations at finite temperature. We also derive
particle's equation of motion, the Langevin equation, by minimizing the
corresponding stochastic effective action, which is obtained with the method of
Feynman-Vernon influence functional. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem is
established from first principles. The backreaction on the charge is known in
terms of electromagnetic self-force given by a third-order time derivative of
the position, leading to the supraohmic dynamics. This self-force can be argued
to be insignificant throughout the evolution when the charge barely moves. The
stochastic force arising from the supraohmic environment is found to have both
positive and negative correlations, and it drives the charge into a fluctuating
motion. Although positive force correlations give rise to the growth of the
velocity dispersion initially, its growth slows down when correlation turns
negative, and finally halts, thus leading to the saturation of the velocity
dispersion. The saturation mechanism in a suparohmic environment is found to be
distinctly different from that in an ohmic environment. The comparison is
discussed.

instrumental image degradation. We use a set of images of quiet Sun granulation
taken in the blue, green and red continuum bands of the Broadband Filter Imager

with Point Spread Functions (PSF) that account for non-ideal contributions due
to instrumental stray-light and imperfections. In addition, synthetic intensity
images are degraded with the corresponding PSFs. The results are compared with
respect to spatial power spectra, intensity histograms, and the centre-to-limb
variation of the intensity contrast. The observational findings are well
matched with corresponding synthetic observables from three-dimensional
radiation (magneto-)hydrodynamic simulations. We conclude that the intensity
contrast of the solar continuum intensity is higher than usually derived from
ground-based observations and is well reproduced by modern numerical
simulations. Properly accounting for image degradation effects is of crucial
importance for comparisons between observations and numerical models. It
finally settles the traditionally perceived conflict between observations and

simulation of crystal growth, however, demonstrates that Ostwald ripening is a
very slow process with a characteristic time proportional to the system size:
The dynamics is nonergodic. It is then argued that by incorporating grinding
dynamics, homochirality is achieved in a short time, independent of the system
size. Grinding limits cluster sizes to a certain range independent of system
size and at the same time keeps the supersaturation so high that population
numbers of average-sized clusters grow. If numbers of clusters for two types of
enantiomers differ by chance, the difference is amplified exponentially and the
system rapidly approaches the homochiral state. Relaxation time to the final
homochiral state is determined by the average cluster size. We conclude that
the system should be driven and kept in a nonequilibrium state to achieve
homochirality.

We focus on the effects that are brought about by different group sizes of

groups of players may induce qualitatively different behavior when approaching
the deterministic limit of strategy adoption. While by pairwise interactions an
intermediate uncertainty by strategy adoptions may ensure optimal conditions
for the survival of cooperators at a specific graph topology, larger groups
warrant this only in the vicinity of the deterministic limit independently from
the underlying graph. These discrepancies are attributed to the indirect
linkage of otherwise not directly connected players, which is brought about by
joint memberships within the larger groups. Thus, we show that increasing the
group size may introduce an effective transition of the interaction topology,

processes due to electron interaction with the cluster are taken into account.
We show that quantum interference between the partial waves injected from the

$\mathbf{j}^{(s)}$, which obtain a strongly inhomogeneous spatial distribution.
This interference produces oscillations of the conductance as a function of the

depends on the current polarization. We predict a strong magneto-orientational
effect: the conductance oscillations may grow, shrink, or even vanish for
rotation of the cluster magnetic moment $\mathbf{\mu}_{\mathrm{eff}}$ by an
external magnetic field. These results can be used for the determination of the

the NZPIM slab are investigated. Due to the linear Dirac dispersion, the
transmission as the function of the frequency has a gap, thus the correspond
reflection has a frequency or wavelength window for the perfect reflection,
which is similar to the Bragg reflection in the one-dimensional photonic
crystals. Near the DP, the associated GH shifts in the transmission and
reflection can be changed from positive to negative with increasing the
wavelength. These negative and positive shifts can also be enhanced by
transmission resonances, when the frequency is far from that at the DP. All
these phenomena will lead to some potential applications in the integrated
optics and optical devices.

$^{12}$C $< 2.5\times10^{-12}$. In the second work PEP was tested with the
NEMO-2 detector and the limits on the violation of PEP for p-shell nucleons in
$^{12}$C were obtained. Specifically, transitions to the fully occupied
$1s_{1/2}$-shell yielded a limit of $4.2\times10^{24}$ y for the process with
the emission of a $\gamma$-quantum. Similarly limits of $3.1\times10^{24}$ y

reported. In the third work it was assumed that PEP is violated for neutrinos,
and thus, neutrinos obey at least partly the Bose-Einstein statistics.
Consequences of the violation of the exclusion principle for double beta decays
were considered. This violation strongly changes the rates of the decays and
modifies the energy and angular distributions of the emitted electrons. It was
shown that pure bosonic neutrinos are excluded by the present experimental
data. In the case of partly bosonic neutrinos the analysis of the existing data
allows one to put an upper bound for $sin^2\chi < 0.6$. The sensitivity of
future measurements is also evaluated.

core-collapse of a rapidly-rotating massive star. This event generates a highly
relativistic jet and prompt gamma-ray and X-ray emission arises from internal
shocks in the jet or magnetised outflows. If the stellar core does not
immediately collapse to a black hole, it may form an unstable, highly

would inject energy into the jet causing a distinctive bump in the GRB light
curve where the emission becomes fairly constant followed by a steep decay when
the magnetar collapses. We assume that the collapse of a massive star to a
magnetar can launch the initial jet. By automatically fitting the X-ray
lightcurves of all GRBs observed by the Swift satellite we identified a subset
of bursts which have a feature in their light curves which we call an internal
plateau -- unusually constant emission followed by a steep decay -- which may
be powered by a magnetar. We use the duration and luminosity of this internal

MegaCam, the 1 deg^2 imager on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT). The
uncertainty affecting the photometric calibration of the survey dominates the
systematic uncertainty of the key measurement of the survey, namely the dark
energy equation of state. The photometric calibration of the SNLS requires
obtaining a uniform response across the imager, calibrating the science field
stars in each survey band (SDSS-like ugriz bands) with respect to standards
with known flux in the same bands, and binding the calibration to the UBVRI
Landolt standards used to calibrate the nearby SNe from the literature
necessary to produce cosmological constraints. The spatial non-uniformities of
the imager photometric response are mapped using dithered observations of dense
stellar fields. Photometric zero-points against Landolt standards are obtained.
The linearity of the instrument is studied. We show that the imager filters and
photometric response are not uniform and publish correction maps. We present
models of the effective passbands of the instrument as a function of the
position on the focal plane. We define a natural magnitude system for MegaCam.

present additional evidence for the existence of two distinct components of
novae ejecta having different origins. As argued in Paper I one component is
the rapidly expanding gas ejected from the outer layers of the white dwarf by
the outburst. The second component is pre-existing outer, more slowly expanding
circumbinary gas that represents ejecta from the secondary star or accretion
disk. We present measurements of the emission-line widths that show them to be
significantly narrower than the broad P Cygni profiles that immediately precede
them. The emission profiles of novae in the nebular phase are distinctly
rectangular, i.e., strongly suggestive of emission from a relatively thin,
roughly spherical shell. We thus interpret novae spectral evolution in terms of
the collision between the two components of ejecta, which converts the early
absorption spectrum to an emission-line spectrum within weeks of the outburst.
The narrow emission widths require the outer circumbinary gas to be much more
massive than the white dwarf ejecta, thereby slowing the latter's expansion
upon collision. The presence of a large reservoir of circumbinary gas at the
time of outburst is suggestive that novae outbursts may sometime be triggered
by collapse of gas onto the white dwarf, as occurs for dwarf novae, rather than
steady mass transfer through the inner Lagrangian point.

calculated at finite temperatures and fixed chemical potential. We observe
maximum electron number as a function of temperature close to the chemical
potential of the upper critical value that corresponds to half filling. As the
chemical potential approaches the upper critical value from below, the
temperature $(T_{\rm M})$ at which the electron number shows its maximum
asymptotically approaches a universal relation. We show that, below the energy
corresponding to $T_{\rm M}$, the charge excitation spectrum nearly obeys a

sources discovered in the Parkes Multibeam Pulsar Survey. These provide four
new phase-connected timing solutions and two updated ones, making a total of
seven of the original 11 reported RRATs now with high-precision rotational and
astrometric parameters. Three of these seven RRATs have magnetic fields greater
than 10^13 G, with spin-down properties similar to those of the magnetars and
X-ray detected isolated neutron stars. Another two of these RRATs have long
periods and large characteristic ages, and lie near the `death-line' for radio
pulsar emission. The remaining two RRATs with timing solutions have properties
typical of the bulk of the pulsar population. The new solutions offer insights
into what might be responsible for the unusual emission properties. We
demonstrate that the RRATs have significantly longer periods and higher
magnetic fields than normal radio pulsars, and find no correlation with other
spin-down parameters. These solutions also provide precise positions, which
will facilitate follow-up studies at high energies, crucial for relating these
sources with other neutron star populations.

wormhole geometry is compactified to a single ""puncture point"" on the
computational grid. The region surrounding the puncture quickly evolves to a
trumpet geometry. The computational grid covers only a portion of the trumpet
throat. It ends at a boundary whose location depends on resolution. This raises
the possibility that perturbations in the trumpet geometry could propagate down
the trumpet throat, reflect from the puncture boundary, and return to the black
hole exterior with a resolution--dependent time delay. Such pathological
behavior is not observed. This is explained by the observation that some
perturbative modes propagate in the conformal geometry, others propagate in the
physical geometry. The puncture boundary exists only in the physical geometry.
The modes that propagate in the physical geometry are always directed away from
the computational domain at the puncture boundary. The finite difference
stencils ensure that these modes are advected through the boundary with no
coupling to the modes that propagate in the conformal geometry. These results
are supported by numerical experiments with a code that evolves spherically
symmetric gravitational fields with standard Cartesian finite difference
stencils. The code uses the Baumgarte--Shapiro--Shibata--Nakamura formulation
of Einstein's equations with 1+log slicing and gamma--driver shift conditions.

frequency selective fading is proposed. It is assumed that all the relay nodes
are equipped with finite impulse response (FIR) filters and use a
filter-and-forward (FF) strategy to compensate for the transmitter-to-relay and
relay-to-destination channels.
  Three relevant half-duplex distributed beamforming problems are considered.
The first problem amounts to minimizing the total relay transmitted power
subject to the destination quality-of-service (QoS) constraint. In the second
and third problems, the destination QoS is maximized subject to the total and
individual relay transmitted power constraints, respectively. For the first and
second problems, closed-form solutions are obtained, whereas the third problem
is solved using convex optimization. The latter convex optimization technique
can be also directly extended to the case when the individual and total power
constraints should be jointly taken into account. Simulation results
demonstrate that in the frequency selective fading case, the proposed FF
approach provides substantial performance improvements as compared to the
commonly used amplify-and-forward (AF) relay beamforming strategy.

for multipartite systems of qubits. The essential step is the construction of
an antilinear operator that we call {\em comb} in reference to the {\em
hairy-ball theorem}. An appealing feature of this approach is that for qubits
(or spins 1/2) the combs are automatically invariant under $SL(2,\CC)$, which
implies that the obtained invariants are entanglement monotones by
construction. By asking which property of a state determines whether or not it
is detected by a polynomial $SL(2,\CC)$ invariant we find that it is the
presence of a {\em balanced part} that persists under local unitary
transformations. We present a detailed analysis for the maximally entangled
states detected by such polynomial invariants, which leads to the concept of
{\em irreducibly balanced} states. The latter indicates a tight connection with
SLOCC classifications of qubit entanglement. \\ Combs may also help to define
measures for multipartite entanglement of higher-dimensional subsystems.
However, for higher spins there are many independent combs such that it is
non-trivial to find an invariant one. By restricting the allowed local
operations to rotations of the coordinate system (i.e. again to the
$SL(2,\CC)$) we manage to define a unique extension of the concurrence to
general half-integer spin with an analytic convex-roof expression for mixed
states.

vital clue to understanding these objects and how they relate to the greater
neutron star population. An X-ray counterpart to J1819-1458 is known, and its
properties are similar to those of other middle-aged (0.1 Myr) neutron stars.
We have searched for X-ray emission with Chandra/ACIS at the positions of two
RRATs with arcsecond (or better) localisation, J0847-4316 and J1846-0257.
Despite deep searches (especially for J1847-0257) we did not detect any
emission with 0.3-8 keV count-rate limits of 1 counts/ks and 0.068 counts/ks,
respectively, at 3sigma confidence. Assuming thermal emission similar to that
seen from J1819-1458 (a blackbody with radius of approximately 20 km), we
derive effective temperature limits of 77 eV and 91 eV for the nominal values
of the distances and column densities to both sources, although both of those
quantities are highly uncertain and correlated. If we instead fix the
temperature of the emission (a blackbody with kT=0.14 keV), we derive
unabsorbed luminosity limits in the 0.3-8 keV range of 1e32 erg/s and 3e32
erg/s. These limits are considerably below the luminosity of J1819-1458 (4e33
erg/s), suggesting that RRATs J0847-4316 and J1846-0257 have cooled beyond the
point of visibility (plausible given the differences in characteristic age).
However, as we have not detected X-ray emission, it may also be that the
emission from RRATs J0847-4316 and J1846-0257 has a different character from
that of J1819-1458. The two non-detections may prove a counterpoint to
J1819-1458, but more detections are certainly needed before we can begin to
derive general X-ray emission properties for the RRAT populations.

observe an exponential damping of the turbulent velocity fluctuations as a
function of the interaction parameter N (ratio of Lorentz force over inertial
terms of the Navier-Stokes equation). The flow structures develop some
anisotropy but do not become bidimensional. From a dynamical viewpoint, the
damping first occurs homogeneously over the whole spectrum of frequencies. For
larger values of N, a very strong additional damping occurs at the highest
frequencies. However, the injected mechanical power remains independent of the
applied magnetic field. The simultaneous measurement of induced magnetic field
and electrical potential differences shows a very weak correlation between
magnetic field and velocity fluctuations. The observed reduction of the
fluctuations is in agreement with a previously proposed mechanism for the
saturation of turbulent dynamos and with the order of magnitude of the Von

gamma-ray experiments during the fifth LIGO science run and first Virgo science
run. The data used in this analysis were collected from 2005 November 4 to 2007
October 1, and most of the GRB triggers were from the Swift satellite. The
search uses a coherent network analysis method that takes into account the
different locations and orientations of the interferometers at the three
LIGO-Virgo sites. We find no evidence for gravitational-wave burst signals
associated with this sample of GRBs. Using simulated short-duration (<1 s)
waveforms, we set upper limits on the amplitude of gravitational waves
associated with each GRB. We also place lower bounds on the distance to each
GRB under the assumption of a fixed energy emission in gravitational waves,
with typical limits of D ~ 15 Mpc (E_GW^iso / 0.01 M_o c^2)^1/2 for emission at
frequencies around 150 Hz, where the LIGO-Virgo detector network has best
sensitivity. We present astrophysical interpretations and implications of these

development of new, large radio astronomy instruments. Complexity is a strong
cost driver so every effort should be made to assign differing science
requirements to different instruments and probably different sites. The appeal
of shared resources is generally not realized in practice and can often be
counterproductive. Instrument optimization is much more difficult with longer
lists of requirements, and the development process is longer and less
efficient. More complex instruments are necessarily further behind the
technology state of the art because of longer development times. Including
technology R&D in the construction phase of projects is a growing trend that
leads to higher risks, cost overruns, schedule delays, and project de-scoping.
There are no technology breakthroughs just over the horizon that will suddenly
bring down the cost of collecting area. Advances come largely through careful
attention to detail in the adoption of new technology provided by industry and
the commercial market. Radio astronomy instrumentation has a very bright
future, but a vigorous long-term R&D program not tied directly to specific
projects needs to be restored, fostered, and preserved.

valence band maximum is mainly due to the t_2g orbitals of Cr^3+ and that spin
polarization is predicted with 3 mu_B per Cr^3+. The structural
characterizations of CuCr1-xMgxO2 reveal a very limited range of Mg^2+

ions substituted by Mg site is measured in the sample. This result is also
consistent with the detection of Mg spinel impurities from X-ray diffraction

electrical resistivity and thermoelectric power observed for x > 0.01. Such a
very weak solubility limit could also be responsible for the discrepancies
found in the literature. Furthermore, the measurements made under magnetic
field (magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient)
support that the Cr^4+ ""holes"", created by the Mg^2+ substitution, in the

in an initial state thermal model. We identify others that can invalidate such
alternatives, such as non-identical particle correlations and m_T scaling for
particles of higher mass. Studies with a simple rescattering code show that as
the interaction cross-section is increased the system develops collective
behavior and becomes more thermalized at the same time, the two effects being
the natural consequence of increased number of particle rescatterings.
Repeating calculations with a more realistic rescattering model confirmed all
of these conclusions and provided deeper insight into the mechanisms of
collectivity buildup, showing a preference for a thermal model with uniform
temperature.

include charged bunches that move along the axis of the pipe with constant
speed for which an exact solution to the initial-boundary value problem for
Maxwell's equations in the beam pipe is derived. In the ultra-relativistic
limit all longitudinal components of the fields tend to zero and the spectral
content of the transverse fields and average total electromagnetic energy
crossing any section of the beam pipe are directly related to the properties of
the ultra-relativistic source. It is shown that for axially symmetric
ultra-relativistic bunches interference effects occur that show a striking
resemblance to those that occur due to CSR in cyclic machines despite the fact
that in this limit the source is no longer accelerating. The results offer an
analytic description showing how such enhanced spectral behaviour depends on
the geometry of the source and the details of the stochastic distribution of
structure within the source. They offer a viable experimental means for
inferring properties of the longitudinal charge distribution of bunches with
micro-structure in ultra-relativistic motion in straight segments of a beam
pipe from observation of the associated electromagnetic energy spectra. They
are also of relevance to design criteria where the coherence effects of such

investigated as a function of the pressure of various gases as well as of the
film thickness. A physical, piezoresistive response is found to coexist with a
chemical response if the gas is chemically active, like, e.g., oxygen. The
piezoresistance is studied separately by exposing the films to the chemically
inert gases such as nitrogen and argon. We observe that the character of the
piezoresistive response is a function not only of the film thickness, but also
of the pressure. Films of a thickness below 70 nm show a decreasing resistance
as pressure is applied, while for thicker films, the piezoresistance is
positive. Moreover, in some films of thickness of about 70 nm, the
piezoresistive response changes from negative to positive as the gas pressure
is increased above 500 mbars. This behavior is interpreted in terms of a total
piezoresistance which is composed of a surface and a bulk component, each of
which contributes in a characteristic way. These results suggest that in
polypyrrole, chemical sensing and piezoresistivity can coexist, which needs to
be kept in mind when interpreting resistive responses of such sensors.

these dwarfs are remarkably smooth in appearance, showing no evidence for
internal features that could be the result of tidal processes or star formation
induced by the cluster potential. Based on these observations and the
relatively large sizes of these dwarfs, we argue that at least some must have a
large dark matter component to prevent their disruption by the cluster
potential. We further derive a new method to quantify the dark matter content
of cluster dSphs without the use of kinematics, which are impossible to obtain
at these distances. We find that mass-to-light ratios for dwarfs in the core of
the Perseus Cluster are comparable to those found for Local Group dSphs,
ranging between M/L ~ 1 and 120. This is evidence that dwarf spheroidals reside
in dark matter subhalos that protect them from tidal processes in the cores of

We
focus on the description of an open FRW universe that results from a tunneling
event in which a false vacuum with positive vacuum energy decays to a
supersymmetric vacuum with vanishing cosmological constant. The observations of
a ""Census Taker"" in the final vacuum can be organized into a holographic dual
conformal field theory that lives on the asymptotic boundary of space. We refer
to this bulk-boundary correspondence as FRW/CFT duality. The dual CFT is a
Euclidean two-dimensional theory that includes a Liouville 2-D gravity sector
describing geometric fluctuations of the boundary. The RG flow of the theory is
richer than in the ADS/CFT correspondence, and generates two space-time
dimensions--one space-like and one time-like. We discuss a number of phenomena
such as bubble collisions, and the Garriga, Guth, Vilenkin ""persistence of
memory,"" from the dual viewpoint.

fields (MSRF) is proposed and applied to wavefunctions in solid state
nanostructures. Its primary target is to provide an essential tool for the
study and analysis of the electronic and optical properties of semiconductor
quantum heterostructures with relatively high point-group symmetry, and studied
with the $k\cdot p$ formalism. Nevertheless the approach is valid in a much
larger framework than $k\cdot p$ theory, it is applicable to arbitrary systems
of coupled partial differential equations (e.g. strain equations or Maxwell
equations). For spinless problems (scalar equations), one can use a systematic
Spatial Domain Reduction (SDR) technique which allows, for every irreducible
representation, to reduce the set of equations on a minimal domain with
automatic incorporation of the boundary conditions at the border, which are
shown to be non-trivial in general. For a vectorial or spinorial set of
functions, the SDR technique must be completed by the use of an optimal basis
in vectorial or spinorial space (in a crystal we call it the Optimal Bloch
function Basis - OBB). The advantages are numerous: sharper insights on the
symmetry properties of every eigenstate, minimal coupling schemes, analytically
and computationally exploitable at the component function level, minimal
computing domains. The formalism can be applied also as a postprocessing
operation, offering all subsequent analytical and computationnal advantages of
symmetrization. The specific case of a quantum wire (QWRs) with $C_{3v}$ point
group symmetry is used as a concrete illustration of the application of MSRF.

made of stars not bound to individual galaxies. We have carried out a large
scale study of this component in the nearby Virgo cluster. The diffuse light is
traced using planetary nebulae (PNe). The PNe are detected in the on-band image
due to their strong emission in the [OIII] 5007 line, but disappear in the
off-band image. The contribution of Ly-alpha emitters at z=3.14 are corrected
statistically using blank field surveys. We have surveyed a total area of 3.3
square degrees in the Virgo cluster with eleven fields located at different
radial distances. Those fields located at smaller radii than 80 arcmin from the
cluster center contain most of the detected diffuse light. In this central
region of the cluster, the ICL has a surface brightness in the range 28.8 - 30
mag per sqarsec in the B band, it is not uniformly distributed, and represents
about 7% of the total galaxy light in this area. At distances larger than 80
arcmin the ICL is confined to single fields and individual sub-structures, e.g.
in the Virgo sub-clump B, the M60/M59 group. For several fields at 2 and 3
degrees from the Virgo cluster center we set only upper limits. These results
indicate that the ICL is not homogeneously distributed in the Virgo core, and
it is concentrated in the high density regions of the Virgo cluster, e.g. the
cluster core and other sub-structures. Outside these regions, the ICL is
confined within areas of 100 kpc in size, where tidal effects may be at work.
These observational results link the formation of the ICL with the formation
history of the most luminous cluster galaxies.

sensitivity while mapping large regions of space with much greater efficiency
than is achieved with current telescopes. This requires new instrumentation
with the greatest achievable sensitivity, dynamic range, and field of view.
Receiver noise is quickly approaching fundamental limits at most radio
wavelengths, so significant gains in sensitivity can only be made by increasing
collecting area. Jointly, these requirements suggest using large arrays of
smaller antennas, or many moderate-size antennas equipped with multi-beam
arrays. The challenge is to develop receivers and wide bandwidth data transport
systems which are lower cost, more compact, more reliable, lower weight, and
more reproducible than the best current systems, with no compromise to
performance. This can be achieved with a greater degree of component
integration, extensive use of digital signal processing and transport, and
replacement of functions currently performed in bulky waveguide and coaxial
cable components with digital arithmetic and thin optical fibers. In this white
paper, we outline the complete redesign and re-optimization of receiver
architecture to take advantage of the latest advancements in commercial
technology. This involves the seamless integration of the conversions from RF
to baseband, from analog to digital, and from copper to fiber within a single
receiver module.

mid-infrared surveys. They are thought to be the birthplace of massive stars,
yet remarkably little information exists on the properties of the population as
a whole (e.g. mass spectrum, spatial distribution). Genetic forward modelling
is used along with the Two Micron All Sky Survey and the Besancon Galactic
model to deduce the three dimensional distribution of interstellar extinction
towards previously identified IRDC candidates. This derived dust distribution
can then be used to determine the distance and mass of IRDCs, independently of
kinematic models of the Milky Way. Along a line of sight that crosses an IRDC,
the extinction is seen to rise sharply at the distance of the cloud. Assuming a
dust to gas ratio, the total mass of the cloud can be estimated. The method has
been successfully applied to 1259 IRDCs, including over 1000 for which no
distance or mass estimate currently exists. The IRDCs are seen to lie
preferentially along the spiral arms and in the molecular ring of the Milky
Way, reinforcing the idea that they are the birthplace of massive stars. Also,
their mass spectrum is seen to follow a power law with an index of -1.75 +/-
0.06, steeper than giant molecular clouds in the inner Galaxy, but comparable
to clumps in GMCs. This slope suggests that the IRDCs detected using the
present method are not gravitationally bound, but are rather the result of
density fluctuations induced by turbulence.

sufficiently described as yet in the literature: (i) the use of a realistic
form factor, based on the Fermi charge distribution for the nucleus, is
absolutely indispensable for reliable theoretical predictions; (ii) we checked
quantitatively that the equivalent photon approximation has a very good
accuracy for the discussed processes; and (iii) we present a leading
logarithmic calculation of the Coulomb corrections which correspond to
multi-photon exchange of the produced mu+/- with the nuclei. These corrections
are found to be small (on the percent level). Our result justifies using the
Born approximation for numerical simulations of the discussed process at the
