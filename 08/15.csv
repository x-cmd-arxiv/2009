various choices of parameters, and with no deformations in the ultraviolet
other than a chemical potential for the electric charge under the Abelian gauge
field. For W-shaped potentials with symmetry-breaking minima, an analysis of
infrared asymptotics suggests that the ground state has emergent conformal
symmetry in the infrared when the charge of the complex scalar is large enough.
But when this charge is too small, the likeliest ground state has Lifshitz-like
scaling in the infrared. For positive mass quadratic potentials, Lifshitz-like
scaling is the only possible infrared behavior for constant nonzero values of
the scalar. The approach to Lifshitz-like scaling is shown in many cases to be
oscillatory.

between $10^6 M_{\odot}$ and an upper limit of $2\times10^9 M_{\odot}$. Using

formation models. Its accretion history can be understood in terms of a
two-component gaseous subnebula, with a relatively dense inner region, and an
extended tail out to the location of the irregular satellites, as in the SEMM
model of Mosqueira and Estrada (2003a,b). Following giant planet formation,
planetesimals in the feeding zone of Jupiter and Saturn become dynamically
excited, and undergo a collisional cascade. Ablation and capture of
planetesimal fragments crossing the gaseous circumplanetary disks delivers
enough collisional rubble to account for the mass budgets of the regular
satellites of Jupiter and Saturn. This process can result in rock/ice
fractionation provided the make up of the population of disk crossers is
non-homogeneous, thus offering a natural explanation for the marked
compositional differences between outer solar nebula objects and those that
accreted in the subnebulae of the giant planets. Consequently, our model leads
to an enhancement of the ice content of Iapetus, and to a lesser degree those
of Ganymede, Titan and Callisto, and accounts for the (non-stochastic)
compositions of these large, low-porosity outer regular satellites of Jupiter
and Saturn. (abridged)

XSW intensity modulation is strongly enhanced by the total external reflection

exploits interference to obtain significantly higher rates between users in a

transmitted messages according to their observed channel coefficients rather
than ignoring the interference as noise. After decoding these linear equations,
the relays simply send them towards the destinations, which given enough
equations, can recover their desired messages. The underlying codes are based
on nested lattices whose algebraic structure ensures that integer combinations
of codewords can be decoded reliably. Encoders map messages from a finite field
to a lattice and decoders recover equations of lattice points which are then
mapped back to equations over the finite field. This scheme is applicable even
if the transmitters lack channel state information.

Chern-Simons-matter theory determines the minimum amount of global symmetry
that the associated quartic superpotential must realise, which in turn
restricts the matter superfield representations. Our analysis clarifies the
necessary representation-theoretic data which guarantees a particular amount of
superconformal symmetry. Thereby we shall recover all the examples of M2-brane
effective field theories that have appeared in the recent literature. The
results are based on a refinement of the unitary representation theory of Lie
algebras to the case when the Lie algebra admits an ad-invariant inner product.
The types of representation singled out by the superconformal symmetry turn out
to be intimately associated with triple systems admitting embedding Lie
(super)algebras and we obtain a number of new results about these triple
systems which might be of independent interest. In particular, we prove that
any metric 3-Lie algebra embeds into a real metric 3-graded Lie superalgebra in

scaling relation between total mass and velocity dispersion and the velocity
bias of galaxies in groups and clusters using self-consistent cosmological
simulations. We show that the baryon dissipation increases the velocity
dispersion of dark matter within the virial radius by 5% - 10%. The effect is
mainly driven by the change in density and gravitational potential in inner
regions of cluster, and it is larger in lower mass systems where gas cooling
and star formation are more efficient. We also show that the galaxy velocity
bias depends on how galaxies are selected. Galaxies selected based on their
stellar mass exhibit no velocity bias, while galaxies selected based on their
total mass show positive bias of ~10%, consistent with previous results based
on collisionless dark matter- only simulations. We further find that
observational estimates of galaxy velocity dispersion are unbiased with respect
to the velocity dispersion of dark matter, provided galaxies are selected using
their stellar masses and and their velocity dispersions are computed with more
than twenty most massive galaxies. Velocity dispersions estimated with fewer
galaxies, on the other hand, can lead to significant underestimate of dynamical
masses. Results presented in this paper should be useful in interpretating
high-redshift groups and clusters as well as cosmological constraints derived

previously-introduced (3+1) method for self-force calculations, and demonstrate
its viability by applying it to the test case of a scalar charge moving in a

self-force and the energy flux correctly to within $< 1%$. We also demonstrate
consistency between $t$-component of the self-force and the scalar energy flux.

formulation we treat the spatial disorder exactly, and therefore we account for
effects arising from localization physics. We have examined the model for
electronic densities well away 1/2 filling, thereby avoiding the physics of a
Mott insulator. Several recent studies have made clear that the combined
effects of electronic interactions and spatial disorder can give rise to a
suppression of the electronic density of states, and a subsequent
metal-insulator transition can occur. We augment such studies by calculating
the ac conductivity for such systems. Our numerical results show that weak
interactions enhance the density of states at the Fermi level and the
low-frequency conductivity, there are no local magnetic moments, and the ac
conductivity is Drude-like. However, with a large enough disorder strength and
larger interactions the density of states at the Fermi level and the
low-frequency conductivity are both suppressed, the conductivity becomes
non-Drude-like, and these phenomena are accompanied by the presence of local
magnetic moments. The low-frequency conductivity changes from a sigma-sigma_dc
omega^{1/2} behaviour in the metallic phase, to a sigma omega^2 behaviour in
the nonmetallic regime. Our numerical results show that the formation of
magnetic moments is essential to the suppression of the density of states at
the Fermi level, and therefore essential to the metal-insulator transition.

identified as a probable recurrent nova based on its large expansion velocities
and the presence of high excitation lines in the outburst spectrum. The event
was recorded on Harvard plate AM 505, at a B magnitude of 10.27 +/- 0.11, which
is near peak. The outburst can only be seen on one plate, but the image has a
characteristic dumbbell shape (caused by a double exposure) that is identical
to the other star images on the plate, and thus is not a plate defect. We
conclude that this is in fact a previously-undiscovered nova outburst of V2487
Oph, confirming our prediction that it is a recurrent nova. We also examine the
discovery efficiency for eruptions of the system and conclude that a
randomly-timed outburst has, on average, a 30% chance of being discovered in

enjoys the advantages of MIMO radar without sacrificing the main advantage of
phased-array radar which is the coherent processing gain at the transmitting
side. The essence of the proposed technique is to partition the transmitting
array into a number of subarrays that are allowed to overlap. Then, each
subarray is used to coherently transmit a waveform which is orthogonal to the
waveforms transmitted by other subarrays. Coherent processing gain can be
achieved by designing a weight vector for each subarray to form a beam towards
a certain direction in space. Moreover, the subarrays are combined jointly to
form a MIMO radar resulting in higher resolution capabilities. The substantial
improvements offered by the proposed phased-MIMO radar technique as compared to
previous techniques are demonstrated analytically and by simulations through
analysis of the corresponding beampatterns and achievable output
signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratios. Both analytical and simulation
results validate the effectiveness of the proposed phased-MIMO radar.

properties of the hot, dense medium produced in central high-energy heavy-ion
collisions as well as of its interaction with products of hard scattering.
However, not all of the observed effects have been fully explained by theory or
models yet; such explanations are hampered in part by the lack of good
reference from lower collision energies. In an attempt to further our
understanding of angular dihadron correlations NA49 has, as one of the first
experiments at the SPS, performed a number of scans of these correlations in
Pb+Pb, Si+Si and p+p collisions at sqrt(sNN) = 17.3 GeV, as well as central
Pb+Pb collisions at sqrt(sNN) = 12.3, 8.8, 7.6 and 6.3 GeV. Results of these
scans have been compared to UrQMD simulations. Our experimental results from
two-particle azimuthal correlations show a flattened away-side peak in central
Pb+Pb (Au+Au) collisions, only weakly depends on collision energy over the
whole investigated energy range - suggesting this effect originates from
sources other than jet-medium interactions. This hypothesis is reinforced by
good agreement with UrQMD regardless of whether jet production was enabled in
the model or not. On the other hand, the amplitude of the near-side peak in
central Pb+Pb (Au+Au) collisions drops visibly with decreasing collision
energy, flattening out around sqrt(sNN) = 8.8 GeV and turning into a depletion
below that energy - possibly an effect related to the onset of deconfinement.
Finally, hints of the ridge structure can be observed in pseudorapidity-azimuth
correlation functions from central Pb+Pb collisions at sqrt(sNN) = 17.3 GeV.

thermodynamical description, by using the fact that extended thermodynamical
potentials belong to a certain class of statistical systems whose probability
distribution functions are defined by a stationary measure; although a measure
which is, in general, different from the equilibrium Gibbs measure. These
probability measures obey a certain hierarchy on its stochastic evolution
towards the most probable (stationary) measure.
  This in turns defines a convergence sequence. We propose a formalism which
considers the mesoscopic stage (typical of non-local dissipative processes such

(SN). Although it was predicted to be bright, the direct observation is
difficult due to the short duration and X-ray/ultraviolet-peaked spectra. First
entire observations of the shock breakouts of Type II Plateau SNe (SNe IIP)
were reported in 2008 by ultraviolet and optical observations by the {\it
GALEX} satellite and supernova legacy survey (SNLS), named SNLS-04D2dc and
SNLS-06D1jd. We present multicolor light curves of a SN IIP, including the
shock breakout and plateau, calculated with a multigroup radiation
hydrodynamical code {\sc STELLA} and an evolutionary progenitor model. The
synthetic multicolor light curves reproduce well the observations of
SNLS-04D2dc. This is the first study to reproduce the ultraviolet light curve
of the shock breakout and the optical light curve of the plateau consistently.
We conclude that SNLS-04D2dc is the explosion with a canonical explosion energy
$1.2\times10^{51}$ ergs and that its progenitor is a star with a zero-age
main-sequence mass $20M_\odot$ and a presupernova radius $800R_\odot$. The
model demonstrates that the peak apparent $B$-band magnitude of the shock
breakout would be $m_{\rm B}\sim26.4$ mag if a SN being identical to
SNLS-04D2dc occurs at a redshift $z=1$, which can be reached by 8m-class
telescopes. The result evidences that the shock breakout has a great potential
to detect SNe IIP at $z\gsim1$.

that the appearance of this similarity is a consequence of the rotational

analyzed. It is shown that the nontrivial details of the temperature dependence

reasonable strain rates and at low temperatures the magnitude of plastic events

effect; for larger systems there exist two cross-over length-scales $\xi_1$ and
$\xi_2$, the first determined by the elastic time-scale and the second by the
thermal energy-scale. For system of linear size $L$ larger than any of these
scales the magnitude of plastic events must be bounded. For systems of size
$L\gg \xi$ there must exist $(L/\xi)^d$ uncorrelated plastic events which occur
simultaneously. We present a scaling theory that culminates with the dependence
of the cross-over scales on temperature and strain rate. Finally we relate
these findings to the temperature and size dependence of the stress

of soft spheres as a function of the packing fraction and obtain the energy
diffusivity, a spectral measure of transport that controls sound propagation
and thermal conductivity. The crossover frequency between weak and strong
phonon scattering is controlled by the coordination and shifts to zero as the
system is decompressed towards the critical packing fraction at which rigidity
is lost. Below the crossover, the diffusivity displays a power-law divergence
with inverse frequency, which suggests that the vibrational modes are primarily
transverse waves, weakly scattered by disorder. Above it, a large number of
modes appear whose diffusivity plateaus at a nearly constant value independent
of the inter-particle potential, before dropping to zero above the Anderson
localization frequency. The thermal conductivity of a marginally jammed solid
just above the rigidity threshold is calculated and related to the one measured
experimentally at room temperature for most glasses.

SINFONI on the ESO/VLT. Our work allows the spectroscopic detection of early
and late type stars to m_K >= 16, more than 2 magnitudes deeper than our
previous data sets. Our observations result in a total sample of 177 bona fide
early-type stars. We find that most of these Wolf Rayet (WR), O- and B- stars
reside in two strongly warped disks between 0.8"" and 12"" from SgrA*, as well as
a central compact concentration (the S-star cluster) centered on SgrA*. The
later type B stars (m_K>15) in the radial interval between 0.8"" and 12"" seem to
be in a more isotropic distribution outside the disks. The observed dearth of
late type stars in the central few arcseconds is puzzling, even when allowing
for stellar collisions. The stellar mass function of the disk stars is
extremely top heavy with a best fit power law of dN/dm ~ m^(-0.45+/-0.3). Since
at least the WR/O-stars were formed in situ in a single star formation event ~6
Myrs ago, this mass function probably reflects the initial mass function (IMF).
The mass functions of the S-stars inside 0.8"" and of the early-type stars at
distances beyond 12"" are compatible with a standard Salpeter/Kroupa IMF (best
fit power law of dN/dm ~ m^(-2.15+/-0.3)).

interactions of electrons implies a significant reduction of the electron
energy loss rate compared to the Thomson limit when the electron energy exceeds
the critical Klein-Nishina energy E_K = gamma_K * m_e c^2 = 0.27 m_e^2
c^2/(k_BT), where T denotes the temperature of the photon graybody
distribution. As a consequence the total radiative energy loss rate of single
electrons exhibits sudden drops in the overall energy loss rate ~ gamma ^2 -
dependence when the electron energy reaches the critical Klein-Nishina energy.
The strength of the drop is proportional to the energy density of the photon
radiation field. The diffuse galactic optical photon fields from stars of
spectral type B and G-K lead to critical Klein-Nishina energies of 40 and 161
GeV, respectively. Associated with the drop in the loss rate are sudden
increases (Klein-Nishina steps) in the equilibrium spectrum of cosmic ray
electrons. Because the radiative loss rate of electrons is the main ingredient
in any transport model of high-energy cosmic ray electrons, Klein-Nishina steps
will modify any calculated electron equilibrium spectrum irrespective of the
electron sources and spatial transport mode. To delineate most clearly the
consequences of the Klein-Nishina drops in the radiative loss rate, we chose as
illustrative example the simplest realistic model for cosmic ray electron
dynamics in the Galaxy, consisting of the competition of radiative losses and
secondary production by inelastic hadron-hadron collisions. We demonstrate that
the spectral structure in the FERMI and H.E.S.S. data is well described and
even the excess measured by ATIC might be explained by Klein-Nishina steps.

electroweak baryogenesis that characterizes transport dynamics ahead of the
phase transition bubble wall within the symmetric phase. In particular, we
generalize existing approaches to distinguish between chemical potentials of
particles and their superpartners. This allows us to test the assumption of
superequilibrium (equal chemical potentials for particles and sparticles) that
has usually been made in earlier studies. We show that in the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model, superequilibrium is generically maintained --
even in the absence of fast supergauge interactions -- due to the presence of
Yukawa interactions. We provide both analytic arguments as well as illustrative
numerical examples. We also extend the latter to regions where analytical
approximations are not available since down-type Yukawa couplings or supergauge
interactions only incompletely equilibrate. We further comment on cases of
broken superequilibrium wherein a heavy superpartner decouples from the
electroweak plasma, causing a kinematic bottleneck in the chain of
equilibrating reactions. Such situations may be relevant for baryogenesis
within extensions of the MSSM. We also provide a compendium of inputs required
to characterize the symmetric phase transport dynamics.
