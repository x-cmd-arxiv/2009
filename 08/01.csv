The dual
provides a basis for the ""leading singularities"" of scattering amplitudes to
all orders in perturbation theory, which are sharply defined, IR safe data that
uniquely determine the full amplitudes at tree level and 1-loop, and are
conjectured to do so at all loop orders. The scattering amplitude for n
particles in the sector with k negative helicity gluons is associated with a
simple integral over the space of k planes in n dimensions, with the action of
parity and cyclic symmetries manifest. The residues of the integrand compute a
basis for the leading singularities. A given leading singularity is associated
with a particular choice of integration contour, which we explicitly identify
at tree level and 1-loop for all NMHV amplitudes as well as the 8 particle
NNMHV amplitude. We also identify a number of 2-loop leading singularities for
up to 8 particles. There are a large number of relations among residues which
follow from the multi-variable generalization of Cauchy's theorem known as the
""global residue theorem"". These relations imply highly non-trivial identities
guaranteeing the equivalence of many different representations of the same
amplitude. They also enforce the cancellation of non-local poles as well as
consistent infrared structure at loop level. Our conjecture connects the
physics of scattering amplitudes to a particular subvariety in a Grassmannian;
space-time locality is reflected in the topological properties of this space.

only depends on the transversal coordinate of the tube. The governing equations

analyze the approximate model that was recently derived by Bonnet-Bendhia,
Durufl\'e and Joly to describe the propagation of the acoustic waves in the
limit when the width of the tube goes to zero. We study this model for strictly
monotonic stable velocity profiles. We prove that the equations of the model of

global solution, and that the solution depends continuously on the initial
data. Moreover, we prove that for smooth profiles the solution grows at most as
$t^3$ as $t \to \infty$, and that for piecewise linear profiles it grows at
most as $t^4$. This establishes the stability of the model in a weak sense.
These results are obtained constructing a quasi-explicit representation of the

the propagation of acoustic waves in the fluid and it provides an efficient way

most abundant source of events for calibration and for testing the
reconstruction algorithms. On the other hand, they represent the major
background source. The simulation of a statistically significant number of
muons in large volume neutrino telescopes requires a big effort in terms of
computing time. Some parameterizations are currently available, but they do not
explicitly take into account the arrival of muons in bundles. A fast Monte
Carlo generator (MUPAGE) was developed to generate single and multiple
atmospheric muon events in underwater/ice neutrino telescopes. The code reduces
the computing time for the simulation of atmospheric muons significantly. The
event kinematics is produced on the surface of a user-defined cylinder,
virtually surrounding the detector volume. The flux of muon bundles at
different depths and zenith angles, the lateral spread and the energy spectrum
of the muons in the bundles are based on parametric formulas. These formulas
were obtained according to a specific primary cosmic ray flux model and
constrained by the measurements of the muon flux in the MACRO underground
experiment. Some MUPAGE applications are presented.

are cut off sharply at small masses, in particular by the LEP Higgs mass

favoured over the focus-point region at about the 3-sigma level, largely but
not exclusively because of g-2. Many sparticle masses are highly correlated in
both the CMSSM and NUHM1, and most of the regions preferred at the 95% C.L. are

demonstrated that the classical simulation of the dynamics of open 1D quantum

performing time evolution in the Heisenberg picture. For a closed system this
was exemplified by an exact matrix product operator solution of the
time-evolved creation operator of a quadratic fermi chain with a matrix
dimension of just two. In this work we show that this exact solution can be
significantly generalized to include the case of an open quadratic fermi chain
subjected to master equation evolution with Lindblad operators that are linear
in the fermionic operators. Remarkably even in this open system the
time-evolution of operators continues to be described by matrix product
operators with the same fixed dimension as that required by the solution of a
coherent quadratic fermi chain for all times. Through the use of matrix product
algorithms the dynamical behaviour of operators in this non-equilibrium open
quantum system can be computed with a cost that is linear in the system size.
We present some simple numerical examples which highlight how useful this might
be for the more detailed study of open system dynamics. Given that Heisenberg
picture simulations have been demonstrated to offer significant accuracy
improvements for other open systems that are not exactly solvable our work also
provides further insight into how and why this advantage arises.

induced by dark matter (DM) annihilation or decay. We show that with standard
(or even extreme) assumptions for DM properties, the optical depth associated
with relativistic electrons injected from DM annihilation or decay is much
smaller than that associated with thermal electrons, when averaged over the
angular resolution of current and future experiments. For example, we find:
$\tau_{\rm DM} \sim 10^{-9}-10^{-5}$ (depending on the assumptions) for $\mchi
= 1$ GeV and a density profile $\rho\propto r^{-1}$ for a template cluster
located at 50 Mpc and observed within an angular resolution of $10""$, compared
to $\tau_{\rm th}\sim 10^{-3}-10^{-2}$. This, together with a full spectral
analysis, enables us to demonstrate that, for a template cluster with generic
properties, the SZ effect due to DM annihilation or decay is far below the
sensitivity of the Planck satellite. This is at variance with previous claims
regarding heavier annihilating DM particles. Should DM be made of lighter
particles, the current constraints from 511 keV observations on the
annihilation cross section or decay rate still prevent a detectable SZ effect.
Finally, we show that spatial diffusion sets a core of a few kpc in the
electron distribution, even for very cuspy DM profiles, such that improving the
angular resolution of the instrument, e.g. with ALMA, does not necessarily
improve the detection potential. We provide useful analytical formulae
parameterized in terms of the DM mass, decay rate or annihilation cross section
and DM halo features, that allow quick estimates of the SZ effect induced by
any given candidate and any DM halo profile.

interesting resurgence phenomenon. It is a non-perturbative improvement in the
sense that, for some optimal truncations of the partial sums, the remainder at
a given hyperasymptotic level is exponentially suppressed compared to the
remainder at the preceding hyperasymptotic level. The Mellin-Barnes
representation allows our results to be automatically valid for a wide range of
the phase of the complex coupling constant, including Stokes lines. A numerical

after this Tutorial-based introductory course, and juniors took it after
completion of their traditional junior-level E&M I and E&M II courses. We find
that, on average, individual BEMA scores do not change significantly after
completion of the introductory course - neither from the freshman to the junior

varied from searching parameters in the literature, through writing and

destruction by tides, and 2) destruction of galaxies by tides is sufficient to
explain the observed intracluster light. These results support the accepted
explanation for the origin of the intracluster light. In an ongoing, second
stage of the simulation, which extends the isolated cluster results to a
cosmologically significant region of the Universe, the author similarly assists
in the implementation of a particle-particle/particle-mesh simulation and the

The procedure provides a meaning for the relevant value of observables when

also be useful as a starting point for a new type of renormalisation procedure,
suitable for dynamically triangulated quantum gravity.
  Random Delaunay triangulations have previously been used to produce
discretisations of continuous Euclidean manifolds, and the coarse-graining
scheme is an extension of this idea, using random simplicial complexes produced
from a dynamical triangulation. In order for a coarse-graining process to be
useful, it should preserve the properties of the original dynamical
triangulation that are relevant when probing at large scales. Some general

observed sources, we confirm that there is significant overlap of the X-ray
spectral properties, as determined by the effective photon indices, Geff,
obtained from the ratios of the 0.5-2 keV to 2-8 keV counts, for the different
optical spectral types. For example, of the broad-line AGNs (non-broad-line
AGNs), 20% +/- 3% (33% +/- 4%) have Geff<1.2 (Geff > 1.2). Thus, one cannot use
the X-ray spectral classifications and the optical spectral classifications
equivalently. Since it is not understood how X-ray and optical classifications
relate to the obscuration of the central engine, we strongly advise against a
mixed classification scheme, as it can only complicate the interpretation of
X-ray AGN samples. We confirm the dependence of optical spectral type on X-ray
luminosity, and for z<1, we find a similar luminosity dependence of Geff.
However, this dependence breaks down at higher redshifts due to the highly
redshift-dependent nature of Geff. We therefore also caution that any
classification scheme which depends on Geff is likely to suffer from serious
redshift bias.

galactic nucleus (AGN) NGC 5548. Nine of the objects in the sample (including
NGC 5548) showed optical variability of sufficient strength during the
monitoring campaign to allow for a time lag to be measured between the
continuum fluctuations and the response to these fluctuations in the broad
Hbeta emission. We present here the light curves for the objects in this sample
and the subsequent Hbeta time lags for the nine objects where these
measurements were possible. The Hbeta lag time is directly related to the size
of the broad-line region, and by combining the lag time with the measured width
of the Hbeta emission line in the variable part of the spectrum, we determine
the virial mass of the central supermassive black hole in these nine AGNs. The
absolute calibration of the black hole masses is based on the normalization
derived by Onken et al. We also examine the time lag response as a function of
velocity across the Hbeta line profile for six of the AGNs. The analysis of
four leads to ambiguous results with relatively flat time lags as a function of
velocity. However, SBS 1116+583A exhibits a symmetric time lag response around
the line center reminiscent of simple models for circularly orbiting broad-line

easily explained by a simple gravitational infall model. Further investigation
will be necessary to fully understand the constraints placed on physical models

the context of two simple free energy landscapes. The first is a double well
potential defined by two macrostates separated by a barrier. The second is a
`golf course' potential defined by microstates having two possible energies
with exponentially more high energy states than low energy states. The
equilibration time for replica exchange is analyzed for both systems. For the
double well system, parallel tempering with a number of replicas that scales as
the square root of the barrier height yields exponential speedup of the
equilibration time. On the other hand, replica exchange yields only marginal
speed-up for the golf course system. For the double well system, the free
energy difference between the two wells has a large effect on the equilibration
time. Nearly degenerate wells equilibrate much more slowly than strongly
asymmetric wells. It is proposed that this difference in equilibration time may
lead to a bias in measuring overlaps in spin glasses. These examples illustrate

well-known Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) protocol. The proposed key sharing
protocol does not assume any prior knowledge about the channel state
information (CSI), but, harnesses the available opportunistic secrecy gains
using only the one bit feedback, in the form of ACK/NACK. The distribution of
key bits among multiple ARQ epochs, in our approach, allows for mitigating the
secrecy outage phenomenon observed in earlier works. We characterize the
information theoretic limits of the proposed scheme, under different
assumptions on the channel spatial and temporal correlation function, and
develop low complexity explicit implementations. Our analysis reveals a novel
role of ""dumb antennas"" in overcoming the negative impact of spatial
correlation, between the legitimate and eavesdropper channels, on the
achievable secrecy rates. We further develop an adaptive rate allocation policy
which achieves higher secrecy rates by exploiting the channel temporal
correlation. Finally, our theoretical claims are validated by numerical results
that establish the achievability of non-zero secrecy rates even when the
eavesdropper channel is less noisy, on the average, than the legitimate
channel.

depends fundamentally on the luminosity of the central engine, but in detail it
also depends on the geometric distribution of the surrounding dust. To quantify
this relationship, we observe nearby normal AGNs in the MIR to achieve spatial
resolution better than 100 pc, and we use absorption-corrected X-ray luminosity
as a proxy for the intrinsic AGN emission. We find no significant difference
between optically classified Seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies. Spectroscopic
differences, both at optical and IR wavelengths, indicate that the immediate
surroundings of AGNs is not spherically symmetric, as in standard unified AGN
models. A quantitative analysis of clumpy torus radiative transfer models shows
that a clumpy local environment can account for this dependence on viewing
geometry while producing MIR continuum emission that remains nearly isotropic,
as we observe, although the material is not optically thin at these
wavelengths. We find some luminosity dependence on the X-ray/MIR correlation in
the smallest scale measurements, which may indicate enhanced dust emission

used in the design of adaptive controllers and parameters update laws if the

At this wavelength, the stellar photospheric emission is negligible and any

However, the Spitzer 160 micron observations are limited in sensitivity by the
large beam size which results in significant ''noise'' due to cirrus and
extragalactic confusion. In addition, the 160 micron measurements suffer from
the added complication of a light leak next to the star's position whose flux

the contamination from the leak and report 160 micron measurements or upper

an important tool to study the interaction between the magnetosphere of the
neutron star and the accretion disk. While the X-ray flux of the brightest
X-ray pulsars have been successfully monitored over many years (e.g. with
RXTE/ASM, CGRO/BATSE, Swift/BAT), the possibility to monitor their pulse timing
properties continuously has so far been very limited. Aims: In our work we show
that the Swift/BAT observations can be used to monitor coherent pulsations of
bright X-ray sources and use the Swift archival data to study one of the most
enigmatic X-ray pulsars, Hercules X-1. A quasi-continuous monitoring of the
pulse period and the pulse period derivative of an X-ray pulsar, here Her X-1,
is achieved over a long time (<~ 4 yrs). We compare our observational results
with predictions of accretion theory and use them to test different aspects of
the physical model of the system. Methods: In our analysis we use the data
accumulated with Swift/BAT starting from the beginning of 2005 (shortly after
launch) until the present time. To search for pulsations and for their
subsequent analysis we used the count rate measured by the BAT detector in the
entire field of view. Results: The slope of the correlation between the locally
determined spin-up rate and the X-ray luminosity is measured for Her X-1 and
found to be in agreement with predictions of basic accretion torque theory. The
observed behaviour of the pulse period together with the previously measured
secular decrease of the system's orbital period is discussed in the frame of a
model assuming ejection of matter close to the inner boundary of the accretion
disk.

equations. We investigate the effects that this kind of dark matter imprints in
the acoustic peaks of the cosmic microwave background. We find that the effect
of the Bose-Einstein statistics is small, albeit perceptible, and is equivalent
to an increase of non-relativistic matter. It is stressed that in this
approach, the mass-to-temperature ratio necessary for ULBDM to be a plausible
DM candidate is about five orders of magnitude. We show that reionization is
also necessary and we address a range of consistent values for this model. We
find that the temperature of ULBDM is below the critical value, impliying that
Bose-Einstein condensation is inherent to the ULBDM paradigm.

that only after appropriate coordinate transformation the asymptotic geometries

  Down to our lower limit of 5.5 mJy we detect no evidence for any change in

  We have matched both our new and earlier catalogues with the NRAO VLA Sky

GHz, in three flux density ranges, we detect a significant shift in the median
value of alpha; samples with higher flux densities have higher proportions of
sources with flat and rising spectra. We suggest that this observed shift is
consistent with a model containing two distinct source populations having
differently sloped source counts. Samples selected at 1.4 GHz contain
significantly smaller proportions of sources with flat and rising spectra.
Also, in our area complete to approximately 10 mJy, we find 5 sources between
10 to 15 mJy, amounting to 4.3 per cent of sources in this range, with no
counterpart in the NVSS catalogue. These results illustrate the problems
inherent in using a low frequency catalogue to characterise the source
population at a much higher frequency and emphasise the value of our blind 15.2

three broad conclusions about the conventional use of statistical methods.
First, results are often reported in an unnecessarily obscure manner. Second,
the null hypothesis testing paradigm is deeply flawed: estimating the size of
effects and citing confidence intervals or levels is usually better. Third,
there are several issues, independent of the particular statistical concepts
employed, which limit the value of any statistical approach: e.g. difficulties
of generalizing to different contexts, and the weakness of some research in
terms of the size of the effects found. The first two of these are easily
remedied: I illustrate some of the possibilities by re-analyzing the data from
the case study article. The third means that in some contexts a statistical
approach may not be worthwhile. My case study is a management paper, but
similar problems arise in other social sciences. Keywords: Confidence,

The behavior of soliton and kink solutions in the vicinity of the ground state

using scaling estimates and numerical minimization of the energy functional.
Conditions of the existence of the solitons are determined. It is shown that
solitons survive in the spiral phase though with some restrictions on their
size. A comparison of the energies of the classical solitons and the bound
