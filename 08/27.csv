galactic white-dwarf binaries in simulated LISA Data. Our search method employs
a hierarchical template-grid based exploration of the parameter space. In the
first stage, candidate sources are identified in searches using different
simulated laser signal combinations (known as TDI variables). Since each source
generates a primary maximum near its true ""Doppler parameters"" (intrinsic
frequency and sky position) as well as numerous secondary maxima of the
F-statistic in Doppler parameter space, a search for multiple sources needs to
distinguish between true signals and secondary maxima associated with other,
""louder"" signals. Our method does this by applying a coincidence test to reject
candidates which are not found at nearby parameter space positions in searches
using each of the three TDI variables. For signals surviving the coincidence
test, we perform a fully coherent search over a refined parameter grid to
provide an accurate parameter estimation for the final candidates. Suitably
tuned, the pipeline is able to extract 1989 true signals with only 5 false
alarms. The use of the rigid adiabatic approximation allows recovery of signal
parameters with errors comparable to statistical expectations, although there
is still some systematic excess with respect to statistical errors expected
from Gaussian noise. An experimental iterative pipeline with seven rounds of
signal subtraction and re-analysis of the residuals allows us to increase the
number of signals recovered to a total of 3419 with 29 false alarms.

Likelihood. Our aim is to construct a procedure that makes no explicit
assumptions, but still providing an accurate estimate of the density. We
introduce the self-consistent estimate: the power spectrum of a candidate
density is given, and an estimation procedure is constructed on the assumption,
to be released \emph{a posteriori}, that the candidate is correct. The
self-consistent estimate is defined as a prior candidate density that precisely
reproduces itself. Our main result is to derive the exact expression of the
self-consistent estimate for any given dataset, and to study its properties.
Applications of the method require neither priors on the form of the density
nor the subjective choice of parameters. A cutoff frequency, akin to a bin size
or a kernel bandwidth, emerges naturally from the derivation. We apply the
self-consistent estimate to artificial data generated from various
distributions and show that it reaches the theoretical limit for the scaling of
the square error with the dataset size.

primordial importance in the global picture of magnetic field evolution, as it
is considered to be the missing link between galactic magnetic fields and
cluster magnetic fields on much larger scales. We are testing whether dwarf
galaxies are good candidates to explain the enrichment of the IGM: after their
discs form and trigger galactic dynamos, supernova feedback will launch strong
winds, expelling magnetic field lines in the IGM. We have performed MHD
simulations of an isolated dwarf galaxy, forming self-consistently inside a
cooling halo. Using the RAMSES code, we have for the first time simulated the
formation of a magnetised supernova-driven galactic outflow. This simulation is
an important step towards a more realistic modelling using fully cosmological
simulations. Our simulations reproduce well the observed properties of magnetic
fields in spiral galaxies. The formation and the evolution of our simulated
disc lead to a strong magnetic field amplification: the magnetic field in the
final wind bubble is one order of magnitude larger than the initial value. The
magnetic field in the disc, essentially toroidal, is growing linearly with time
as a consequence of differential rotation. We discuss the consequence of this
simple mechanism on the cosmic evolution of the magnetic field: we propose a
new scenario for the evolution of the magnetic field, with dwarf galaxies
playing a key role in amplifying and ejecting magnetic energy in the IGM,
resulting in what we call a ""Cosmic Dynamo"" that could contribute to the rather
high field strengths observed in galaxies and clusters today.

that it is holonomic if X has finitely many symplectic leaves, phi is finite,

representations of noncommutative filtered algebras extends to the case where
the associated graded algebra is not necessarily commutative, but is finitely

investigate the influence of shear rate and surface roughness on slip flow of a

shear-rate dependence of the intrinsic slip length in the flow over an
atomically flat surface is computed by MD simulations. We describe laminar flow
away from a curved boundary by means of the effective slip length defined with
respect to the mean height of the surface roughness. Both the magnitude of the
effective slip length and the slope of its rate-dependence are significantly
reduced in the presence of periodic surface roughness. We then numerically
solve the Navier-Stokes equation for the flow over the rough surface using the
rate-dependent intrinsic slip length as a local boundary condition. Continuum
simulations reproduce the behavior of the effective slip length obtained from
MD simulations at low shear rates. The slight discrepancy between MD and
continuum results at high shear rates is explained by examination of the local
velocity profiles and the pressure distribution along the wavy surface. We
found that in the region where the curved boundary faces the mainstream flow,
the local slip is suppressed due to the increase in pressure. The results of
the comparative analysis can potentially lead to the development of an
efficient algorithm for modeling rate-dependent slip flows over rough surfaces.

possible improvements are even greater when nodes perform mutual information
accumulation using rateless codes. In this paper, we investigate routing
problems in such networks. Given a network, a source, and a destination, our
objective is to minimize end-to-end transmission delay under energy and
bandwidth constraints. We provide an algorithm that determines which nodes
should participate in forwarding the message and what resources (time, energy,
bandwidth) should be allocated to each.
  Our approach factors into two sub-problems, each of which can be solved
efficiently. For any transmission order we show that solving for the optimum
resource allocation can be formulated as a linear programming problem. We then
show that the transmission order can be improved systematically by swapping
nodes based on the solution of the linear program. Solving a sequence of linear
programs leads to a locally optimal solution in a very efficient manner. In
comparison to the proposed cooperative routing solution, it is observed that
conventional shortest path multihop routing typically incurs additional delays
and energy expenditures on the order of 70%.
  Our first algorithm is centralized, assuming that routing computations can be
done at a central processor with full access to channel state information for
the entire system. We also design two distributed routing algorithms that
require only local channel state information. We provide simulations showing
that for the same networks the distributed algorithms find routes that are only
about two to five percent less efficient than the centralized algorithm.

have been investigated for more than forty years it was until recently
difficult if not impossible to calculate spatial properties of the ground

so-called Kondo cloud or even its existence have been elusive. In recent years
a new method has been introduced to investigate the properties of magnetic
impurities, the FAIR method, where the abbreviation stands for Friedel
Artificially Inserted Resonance. The FAIR solution of the Friedel-Anderson and
the Kondo impurity problems consists of only eight or four Slater states.
Because of its compactness the spatial electron density and polarization can be
easily calculated. In this article a short review of the method is given. A
comparison with results from the large N-approximation, the Numerical
Renormalization Group theory and other methods shows excellent agreement. The
FAIR solution yields (for the first time) the electronic polarization in the
Kondo cloud.

gamma-ray background (CGB) as they are confirmed gamma-ray emitters and are the
most numerous population of gamma-ray sources, although individually faint.
Even though the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope will be able to resolve few
star-forming galaxies individually, their fractional contribution to the CGB
should become far more significant than it was for past measurements of the CGB
as many of the brighter, formerly unresolved sources will be resolved out.
Thus, the clustering feature of galaxies imprinted on the CGB might be
detectable by Fermi. In anticipation of such measurements, we calculate the
predicted angular auto-power and cross-power spectra of the CGB from normal
galaxies. We find that the amplitude of the auto-power spectrum is smaller than
that for other sources such as blazars and dark-matter annihilation; the shape
is also characteristic. We also show that the cross-power spectrum with galaxy
surveys features larger amplitude. Fermi should be able to detect the
correlation signature in both the auto-power and cross-power spectra at angular
scales of ~1-10 deg after 5-yr of operation. Such a detection would be valuable
in confirming the level of the star-forming galaxy contribution to the CGB, and
more importantly, in serving as a tool in the effort to discriminate between
possible origins of the CGB.

Rather than using a particular semi-analytic model, we take the novel approach
of parametrizing the ionizing sources with arbitrary functions, and perform
likelihood analyses to constrain possible reionization histories. We find model
independent conclusions that reionization is likely to be mostly complete by
z=8 and that the IGM was 50% ionized at z=9-10. Upcoming low-frequency
observations of the redshifted 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen are expected to
place significantly better constraints on the hydrogen neutral fraction at
6<z<12. We use our constraints on the reionization history to predict the
likely amplitude of the 21 cm power spectrum and show that observations with
the highest signal-to-noise ratio will most likely be made at frequencies
corresponding to z=9-10. This result provides an important guide to the
upcoming 21 cm observations. Finally, we assess the impact that measurement of
the neutral fraction will have on our knowledge of reionization and the early
source population. Our results show that a single measurement of the neutral

light bluewards of the Lyman limit of two DLAs at z>3.4, we look for the
continuum emission from intervening galaxies at z~2 that are identified via
strong metal absorption lines. The MgII absorbers have equivalent width large
enough to be potential DLA systems. Deep images are obtained with the FOcal
Reducer and Spectrograph (FORS1) on the Very Large Telescope for the fields
towards SDSS J110855+120953 and SDSS J140850+020522. These quasars have MgII
absorption lines at z=1.87 (W_r(MgII)=2.46 A) and z=1.98 (W_r(MgII)=1.89 A),
respectively, and each QSO has two intervening higher redshift DLAs at z>3. The
U and R bands of FORS1 lie blue and redwards of the Lyman limit of the
background DLAs, allowing us to search for emission from the foreground
galaxies directly along the lines of sight to the QSOs. No galaxies are found
close to the sight line of the QSO to a point source limit of U_AB=28.0. In
both fields, the closest objects lie at an impact parameter of 5 arcsec
corresponding to 40 kpc in projection at z=2, and have typical colours of star
forming galaxies at that redshift. However, the currently available data do not
allow us to confirm if the galaxies lie at the same redshifts as the absorption
systems. A more extended structure is visible in the SDSS J14085+020522 field
at an impact parameter of 0.8 arcsec or 7 kpc. If these objects are at z~2
their luminosities are 0.03-0.04 L* in both fields. The star formation rates

substantial lensing signal at the >~ 8 sigma level. This clear detection is
enabled in part by the high mass of the cluster, which is verified by our both
parametric and non-parametric estimation of the cluster mass. Assuming that the
cluster follows a Navarro-Frenk-White mass profile, we estimate that the
projected mass of the cluster within r=1 Mpc is (8.5+-1.7) x 10^14 solar mass,
where the error bar includes the statistical uncertainty of the shear profile,
the effect of possible interloping background structures, the scatter in
concentration parameter, and the error in our estimation of the mean redshift
of the background galaxies. The high X-ray temperature 8.6_{-1.2}^{+1.3} keV of
the cluster recently measured with Chandra is consistent with this high lensing
mass. When we adopt the 1-sigma lower limit as a mass threshold and use the
cosmological parameters favored by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe

might give rise to detectable hard X-ray photon fluxes from the corona where
ambient densities are too low for significant bremsstrahlung or recombination.
Gamma-ray lines and continuum in some large flares imply the presence of the
necessary ~100 MeV electrons and positrons, the latter as by-products of GeV
energy ions. Recent observations of coronal hard X-ray sources in particular
prompt us to reconsider here the possible contribution of ICS. We aim to
evaluate the ICS X-ray fluxes to be expected from prescribed populations of
relativistic electrons and positrons in the solar corona. The ultimate aim is
to determine if ICS coronal X-ray sources might offer a new diagnostic window
on relativistic electrons and ions in flares. We use the complete formalism of
ICS to calculate X-ray fluxes from possible populations of flare primary
electrons and secondary positrons, paying attention to the incident photon
angular distribution near the solar surface and thus improving on the
assumption of isotropy made in previous solar discussions. Both primary
electrons and secondary positrons produce very hard ICS X-ray spectra. The
anisotropic primary radiation field results in pronounced centre-to-limb
variation in predicted fluxes and spectra, with the most intense spectra,
extending to the highest photon energies, expected from limb flares. Acceptable
numbers of electrons or positrons could account for RHESSI coronal X/gamma-ray
sources. Some coronal X-ray sources at least might be interpreted in terms of
ICS by relativistic electrons or positrons, particularly when sources appear at

the global evolution of the forming cluster is what allows the central stars to
become massive. We predict that massive star forming clumps, such as those
observed in Motte et al. 2007, contract and grow in mass leading to the
formation of massive stars. This occurs as mass is continually channeled from
large radii onto the central proto-stars, which can become massive through
accretion. Using SPH simulations of massive star forming clumps in a Giant
Molecular Cloud, we show that clumps are initially diffuse and filamentary, and
become more concentrated as they collapse. Simulated interferometry
observations of our data provide an explanation as to why young massive star
forming regions show more substructure than older ones. The most massive stars
in our model are found within the most bound cluster. Most of the mass accreted
by the massive stars was originally distributed throughout the clump at low
densities, and was later funneled to the star due to global in-fall. Even with
radiative feedback no massive pre-stellar cores are formed. The original cores
are of intermediate mass and gain their additional mass in the proto-stellar
stage. We also find that cores which form low mass stars exist within the
volume from which the high mass stars accrete, but are largely unaffected by
this process.

In this paper, we give a partial answer to Bel\'en Palop's question.
  Define $c_p(n) = \max_{A,B}\min_{s,t \in S} \{\dist_p(A,s,t) + \dist_p(B,s,t)

asymptotically optimal bounds $c_p(n) = \Theta(\sqrt{n})$ for all

led previous studies to always adopt a nearly zero obliquity during the
planet's past evolution. However, the initial orientation of Mercury's rotation
axis is unknown and probably much different than today. As a consequence, we
believe that the obliquity could have been significant when the rotation rate
of the planet first encountered spin-orbit resonances. In order to compute the
capture probabilities in resonance for any evolutionary scenario, we present in
full detail the dynamical equations governing the long term evolution of the
spin, including the obliquity contribution.
  The secular spin evolution of Mercury results from tidal interactions with
the Sun, but also from viscous friction at the core-mantle boundary. Here, this
effect is also regarded with particular attention. Previous studies show that a
liquid core enhances drastically the chances of capture in spin-orbit
resonances. We confirm these results for null obliquity, but we find that the
capture probability generally decreases as the obliquity increases. We finally
show that, when core-mantle friction is combined with obliquity evolution, the
spin can evolve into some unexpected configurations as the synchronous or the
1/2 spin-orbit resonance.

nontrivial spatially extended problem in excitable media, and in the case of
cardiac tissue it is an important tool for prediction of cardiac arrhythmias
and fibrillation. An idealized conduction velocity restitution curve requires
solving a nonlinear eigenvalue problem with periodic boundary conditions, which
in the cardiac case is very stiff and calls for the use of asymptotic methods.
We compare asymptotics of restitution curves in four examples, two generic
excitable media models, and two ionic cardiac models. The generic models
include the classical FitzHugh-Nagumo model and its variation by Barkley. They
are treated with standard singular perturbation techniques. The ionic models
include a simplified ""caricature"" of the Noble (1962) model and the Beeler and
Reuter (1977) model, which lead to non-Tikhonov problems where known asymptotic
results do not apply. The Caricature Noble model is considered with particular
care to demonstrate the well-posedness of the corresponding boundary-value
problem. The developed method for calculation of conduction velocity
restitution is then applied to the Beeler-Reuter model. We discuss new
mathematical features appearing in cardiac ionic models and possible

(LyC) in order to understand the cosmic reionization. Here we consider an
escape of nebular LyC from galaxies and examine the consequent spectral energy
distribution. It is usually assumed that hydrogen nebular LyC mostly produced
by bound-free transitions is consumed within photo-ionized nebulae (so-called
""on-the-spot"" approximation). However, an escape of the continuum should be
taken into account if stellar LyC escapes from galaxies through
""matter-bounded"" nebulae. We show that the escaping hydrogen bound-free LyC
makes a strong bump just below the Lyman limit. Such a galaxy would be observed
as a Lyman ""bump"" galaxy. This bump results from the radiation energy
re-distribution of stellar LyC by nebulae. The strength of the bump depends on
electron temperature in nebulae, escape fraction of stellar and nebular LyC,
hardness of stellar LyC (i.e. metallicity, initial mass function, age and star
formation history), and IGM attenuation. We can use the bump to find very young
($\sim1$ Myr), massive ($\sim100$ $M_\odot$), and extremely metal-poor (or
metal-free) stellar populations at $z<4$. Because of the bump, 900 \AA-to-1500
\AA luminosity density ratio (per Hz) becomes maximum (2--3 times larger than
the stellar intrinsic ratio) when about 40% of the stellar LyC is absorbed by
nebulae. The total number of escaping LyC photons increases due to the escape
of nebular LyC but does not exceed the stellar intrinsic one. The radiation
energy re-distribution by nebulae reduces the mean energy of escaping LyC only
by $\approx10$% relative to that of stellar LyC. Therefore, the effect of the
escape of nebular LyC on the reionization process may be small.

fixed speed. The goal for the vehicle is to maximize the fraction of targets
that are captured before reaching the deadline. We consider two cases; when the
service vehicle is faster than the targets, and; when the service vehicle is
slower than the targets. In the first case we develop a novel vehicle policy
based on computing longest paths in a directed acyclic graph. We give a lower
bound on the capture fraction of the policy and show that the policy is optimal
when the distance between the target arrival edge and deadline becomes very
large. We present numerical results which suggest near optimal performance away
from this limiting regime. In the second case, when the targets are slower than
the vehicle, we propose a policy based on servicing fractions of the
translational minimum Hamiltonian path. In the limit of low target speed and
high arrival rate, the capture fraction of this policy is within a small
constant factor of the optimal.

centralized security infrastructures that rely on a limited number of trusted

large-scale distributed system that enables clients with no email
classification functionality to query the network on the behavior of a host. A
SocialFilter node builds trust for its peers by auditing their behavioral
reports and by leveraging the social network of SocialFilter administrators.
The node combines the confidence its peers have in their own reports and the
trust it places on its peers to derive the likelihood that a host is spamming.

a CMB independent estimate of Hubble's constant. A number of researchers have
pointed out the possibilities of breaking degeneracies between Omega_Matter and
H0 if there is a CMB independent distance scale accurate to a few percent (Hu
2005). Current uncertainties in the distance scale are about 10% but future
observations, with, for example, the JWST, will be capable of estimating H0 to
within a few percent. A crucial step in this process is the Cepheid PL
relation. Recent evidence has emerged that the PL relation, at least in optical
bands, is nonlinear and that neglect of such a nonlinearity can lead to errors
in estimating H0 of up to 2 percent. Hence it is important to critically
examine this possible nonlinearity both observationally and theoretically.
Existing PC/PL relations rely exclusively on evaluating these relations at mean
light. However, since such relations are the average of relations at different
phases. Here we report on recent attempts to compare theory and observation in
the multiphase PC/PL planes. We construct state of the art Cepheid pulsations
models appropriate for the LMC/Galaxy and compare the resulting PC/PL relations
as a function of phase with observations. For the LMC, the (V-I) period-color
relation at minimum light can have quite a narrow dispersion (0.2-0.3 mags) and
thus could be useful in placing constraints on models. At longer periods, the
models predict significantly redder (by about 0.2-0.3 mags) V-I colors. We
discuss possible reasons for this and also compare PL relations at various
phases of pulsation and find clear evidence in both theory and observations for
a nonlinear PL relation.

Taking the dynamical history of the Solar system as a guideline -- in which the
planetesimal belts were heavily depleted due to graviational perburbation with
the giant planets -- and assuming similar processes have take place in other
planetary systems, one would expect the interestellar space to be filled with
extra-solar planetesimals. However, not a single one of these objects has been
detected so far entering the Solar system, even though it would clearly be
distinguishable from a Solar system comet due to its highly hyperbolic orbit.
The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will provide wide coverage maps of
the sky to a very high sensitivity, ideal to detect moving objects like comets,
both active and inactive. In anticipation of these observations, we estimate
how many inactive ""interstellar comets"" might be detected during the duration
of the survey. The calculation takes into account estimates (from observations
and models) of the number density of stars, the amount of solids available to
form planetesimals, the frequency of planet and planetesimal formation, the
efficiency of planetesimal ejection, and the possible size distribution of
these small bodies.

narrow component, we detect relatively broad (FWZI 150 km/s) absorption. This
broad component is redshifted by ~80 km/s compared to the systemic velocity,
while the narrow absorption is redshifted ~ 490 km/s. Both HI absorption
components are spatially resolved at the pc-scale of the VLBI observations. The
broad component shows strong gradients in density (or excitation) and velocity
along the jet. We conclude that this gas is physically close to the AGN,
although the nature of the gas resulting in the broad absorption is not
completely clear. The possibility that it is entrained by the radio jet appears
unlikely. Gas located in a thick circum-nuclear toroidal structure cannot be
completely ruled out although it appears difficult to reconcile with the
observed morphology and kinematics of the HI. A perhaps more likely scenario is
that the gas producing the broad absorption could be (directly or indirectly)
connected with the fuelling of the AGN, i.e. gas that is falling into the
nucleus. If this is the case, the accretion rate derived is similar to that
found for other X-ray luminous elliptical galaxies, although lower than that
derived from the radio core luminosity for NGC 315. The density distribution of
the narrow component is, featureless. Moreover, we detect a small amount of HI
in emission a few kpc SW of the AGN, coincident with faint optical absorption
features and at velocities very similar to the narrow absorption. This suggests
that the gas causing the narrow absorption is not close to the AGN and is more

momentum profile is not unique, we consider the sub-Keplerian regime of the
disk. Without any strict knowledge of the magnetic field structure, we assume
the cooling mechanism is dominated by bremsstrahlung process. We show that in a
range of Shakura-Sunyaev viscosity parameter $0.2\gsim\alpha\gsim0.0005$, flow
behavior varies widely, particularly by means of the size of disk, efficiency
of cooling and corresponding temperatures of ions and electrons. We also show
that the disk around a rotating black hole is hotter compared to that around a
Schwarzschild black hole, rendering a larger difference between ion and
electron temperatures in the former case. With all the theoretical solutions in
hand, finally we reproduce the observed luminosities ($L$) of two extreme cases

law. To discuss the influence of the power-law exponent on the network's
structure and function, a spatial network model is proposed. Based on a regular
network and subject to a limited cost $C$, long range connections are added
with power law distance distribution $P(r)=ar^{-\delta}$. Some basic
topological properties of the network with different $\delta$ are studied. It
is found that the network has the smallest average shortest path when
$\delta=2$. Then a traffic model on this network is investigated. It is found
that the network with $\delta=1.5$ is best for the traffic process. All of
these results give us some deep understandings about the relationship between
spatial structure and network function.

drag caused by turbulence raises pumping costs many times higher than if the
flow were laminar. Drag reduction has therefore long been an aim of high
priority. In order to achieve this end, any drag reduction method must modify
the turbulent mean flow. Motivated by minimization of the input energy this
requires, linearly optimal forcing functions are examined. It is shown that the
forcing mode leading to the greatest response of the flow is always of m=1
azimuthal symmetry. Little evidence is seen of the second peak at large m (wall
modes) found in analogous optimal growth calculations, which may have
implications for control strategies. The model's prediction of large response
of the large length-scale modes is verified in full direct numerical simulation
of turbulence ($Re=5300$, $Re_\tau\approx 180$). Further, drag reduction of
over 12% is found for finite amplitude forcing of the largest scale mode, m=1.
Significantly, the forcing energy required is very small, being less than 2% of
that by the through pressure, resulting in a net energy saving of over 10%.

formulas as games on which proofs induce strategies. Such a semantics is
introduced here for capturing dependencies induced by quantifications in
first-order propositional logic. One of the main difficulties that has to be
faced during the elaboration of this kind of semantics is to characterize
definable strategies, that is strategies which actually behave like a proof.
This is usually done by restricting the model to strategies satisfying subtle
combinatorial conditions, whose preservation under composition is often
difficult to show. Here, we present an original methodology to achieve this
task, which requires to combine advanced tools from game semantics, rewriting
theory and categorical algebra. We introduce a diagrammatic presentation of the
monoidal category of definable strategies of our model, by the means of
generators and relations: those strategies can be generated from a finite set
of atomic strategies and the equality between strategies admits a finite
axiomatization, this equational structure corresponding to a polarized
variation of the notion of bialgebra. This work thus bridges algebra and
denotational semantics in order to reveal the structure of dependencies induced
by first-order quantifiers, and lays the foundations for a mechanized analysis
of causality in programming languages.

to carefully analyze the geometrical structure of this class of Dirac operators

the Einstein-Hilbert action by a ""true"" cosmological constant. Due to its

from a subtle interplay between Dirac and Majorana masses.

properties of tidal tails formed in the immediate vicinity of a two-component
dwarf galaxy evolving in a static potential of the Milky Way (MW). The stellar
component of the dwarf is initially in the form of a disk and the galaxy is
placed on an eccentric orbit motivated by CDM-based cosmological simulations.
We measure the orientation, density and velocity distribution of the stars in
the tails. Due to the geometry of the orbit, in the vicinity of the dwarf,
where the tails are densest and therefore most likely to be detectable, they
are typically oriented towards the MW and not along the orbit. We report on an
interesting phenomenon of `tidal tail flipping': on the way from the pericentre
to the apocentre the old tails following the orbit are dissolved and new ones
pointing towards the MW are formed over a short timescale. We also find a tight
linear relation between the velocity of stars in the tidal tails and their
distance from the dwarf. Using mock data sets we demonstrate that if dwarf
spheroidal (dSph) galaxies in the vicinity of the MW are tidally affected their
kinematic samples are very likely contaminated by tidally stripped stars which
tend to artificially inflate the measured velocity dispersion. The effect is
stronger for dwarfs on their way from the peri- to the apocentre due to the
formation of new tidal tails after pericentre. Realistic mass estimates of dSph
galaxies thus require removal of these stars from kinematic samples.

existence of the class of low surface brightness galaxies (LSBs) have not yet
been understood completely. Since the environment of LSBs has been studied
before only on small scales (below 2 Mpc), a study of the galaxy content in the
vicinity of LSB galaxies on larger scales could add a lot to our understanding
of the origin of this galaxy class. We used the spectroscopic main galaxy
sample of the SDSS DR4 to investigate the environmental galaxy density of LSB
galaxies compared to the galaxy density in the vicinity of high surface
brightness galaxies (HSBs). The environment studies, divided into two redshift
bins, show that both the low mass, and the more massive LSBs possess an
environment with a lower galaxy density than HSBs. The differences in the
galaxy density between LSBs and HSBs are significant on scales between 2 and 5
Mpc, the scales of groups and filaments. To quantify this, we have introduced
for the first time the LSB-HSB Antibias. The obtained LSB-HSB Antibias
parameter has a value of 10%-15%. From these results we conclude that LSBs
formed in low-density regions of the initial universe and have drifted until
now to the outer parts of the filaments and walls of the large-scale structure.
Furthermore, our results, together with actual cosmological simulations, show
that LSBs are caused by a mixture of nature and nurture.

young ($\sim$0.5 Myr) star-forming clusters that are one of the most distant
embedded clusters in the EOG. We find that in both clusters the fraction of
stars with NIR excess, which originates from the circumstellar dust disk at

neighborhood. Our results suggest that most stars forming in the
low-metallicity environment experience disk dispersal at an earlier stage ($<$1
Myr) than those forming in the solar metallicity environment (as much as
$\sim$5--6 Myr). Such rapid disk dispersal may make the formation of planets
difficult, and the shorter disk lifetime with lower metallicity could
contribute to the strong metallicity dependence of the well-known
""planet-metallicity correlation"", which states the probability of a star
hosting a planet increases steeply with stellar metallicity. The reason for the
rapid disk dispersal could be increase of the mass accretion rate and/or the
effective far-ultraviolet photoevaporation due to the low extinction; however,
another unknown mechanism for the EOG environment could be contributing
significantly.
