some of its expected general properties. We first discuss basic questions
regarding existence of such a matrix, including those of infrared divergences
and description of asymptotic states. Distinct scattering behavior occurs in
the Born, eikonal, and strong gravity regimes, and we describe aspects of both
the partial wave and momentum space amplitudes, and their analytic properties,
from these regimes. Classically the strong gravity region would be dominated by
formation of black holes, and we assume its unitary quantum dynamics is
described by corresponding resonances. Masslessness limits some powerful
methods and results that apply to massive theories, though a continuation path
implying crossing symmetry plausibly still exists. Physical properties of
gravity suggest nonpolynomial amplitudes, although crossing and causality
constrain (with modest assumptions) this nonpolynomial behavior, particularly
requiring a polynomial bound in complex s at fixed physical momentum transfer.
We explore the hypothesis that such behavior corresponds to a nonlocality
intrinsic to gravity, but consistent with unitarity, analyticity, crossing, and
causality.

which an $A_4$ flavor symmetry yields a drastic reduction in the number of free
parameters, implying that at leading order several quantities are only a
function of the lightest neutrino mass $m_l$, which in turn is strongly
constrained. For normal ordering (NO) we find m_l\simeq (0.0044 \div 0.0056) eV

|m_{ee}|\gsim 0.017 eV (IO). We show that the leptogenesis CP asymmetries only
depend on m_l, on a single non-hierarchical Yukawa coupling y, and on two
parameters that quantify the flavor symmetry breaking effects, and we argue
that the unflavored regime for leptogenesis is strongly preferred in our model,
thus realizing a rather predictive scenario. Performing a calculation of the
matter-antimatter asymmetry we find that for NO the observed value is easily
reproduced for natural values of the symmetry breaking parameters. For IO
successful leptogenesis is possible for a limited choice of the parameters

for our understanding of massive star formation and early cluster evolution. A
promising route toward rapid mass segregation was proposed by McMillan et al.

inherit their apparent dynamical age from their progenitors. In this paper we
briefly consider this process at a size and time scale more suited for local
and perhaps more typical star formation, with stellar numbers from the hundreds
to thousands. We find that for reasonable ages and cluster sizes, the merger of
sub-clusters can indeed lead to compact configurations of the most massive
stars, a signal seen both in Nature and in large-scale hydrodynamic simulations
of star formation from collapsing molecular clouds, and that sub-virial initial
conditions can make an un-merged cluster display a similar type of mass
segregation. Additionally, we discuss a variation of the minimum spanning tree

for correlations between bar, ring metric parameters, and Qg.
  Our atlas of nuclear rings includes star-forming and dust rings. Nuclear
rings span a range from a few tens of parsecs to a few kiloparsecs in radius.
Star-forming nuclear rings can be found in a wide range of morphological types,
from S0 to Sd, with a peak in the distribution between Sab and Sb, and without
strong preference for barred galaxies. Dust nuclear rings are found in
elliptical and S0 galaxies. For barred galaxies, the maximum radius that a
nuclear ring can reach is a quarter of the bar radius. We found a nearly random
distribution of PA offsets between nuclear rings and bars. There is some
evidence that nuclear ring ellipticity is limited by bar ellipticity. We
confirm that the maximum relative size of a star-forming nuclear ring is
inversely proportional to the non-axisymmetric torque parameter, Qg, and that
the origin of nuclear rings, even the ones in non-barred hosts, are closely

change of the orbital period of the system of $\dot{P}_{b} = 5(1)\times

sensitivity, the coupling of the free running laser frequency noise to the
signal readout must be reduced by more than 14 orders of magnitude. One
technique employed to reduce the laser frequency noise will be arm locking,
where the laser frequency is locked to the LISA arm length. This paper details
an implementation of arm locking, studies orbital effects, the impact of errors
in the Doppler knowledge, and noise limits. The noise performance of arm
locking is calculated with the inclusion of the dominant expected noise
sources: ultra stable oscillator (clock) noise, spacecraft motion, and shot
noise. Studying these issues reveals that although dual arm locking [A. Sutton
& D. A Shaddock, Phys. Rev. D 78, 082001 (2008).] has advantages over single
(or common) arm locking in terms of allowing high gain, it has disadvantages in
both laser frequency pulling and noise performance. We address this by
proposing a hybrid sensor, retaining the benefits of common and dual arm
locking sensors. We present a detailed design of an arm locking controller and
perform an analysis of the expected performance when used with and without
laser pre-stabilization. We observe that the sensor phase changes beneficially
near unity-gain frequencies of the arm-locking controller, allowing a factor of
10 more gain than previously believed, without degrading stability. We show
that the LISA frequency noise goal can be realized with arm locking and
Time-Delay Interferometry only, without any form of pre-stabilization.

between 2 and 300K for $x$ = 0, 0.05, 0.08, 0.12 and 0.15. Fe doping is found
to depress the magnetic ordering temperature from 30K for $x$ = 0 to below 2K
for $x$ = 0.15. Although Fe doping results in a large increase of the
low-temperature residual resistivity, the temperature dependence of the
resistivity above the magnetic transition remains practically unaffected by
increasing Fe content. An analysis of the temperature derivative of the
resistivity provides strong evidence for the existence of a non-Fermi-liquid
ground state near $x$ = 0.15 and thus for a quantum critical point tuned by Fe
content.

present-day dark halos. We estimate the unevolved sub-halo mass functions
(USMFs), for which sub-halo masses are measured at the times of their
accretion. For sub-halos that merge into the main branch of a present-day dark
halo, their USMF can be well described by a universal functional form, in
excellent agreement with previous results. The same conclusion can also be
reached for the USMF of all progenitors that have merged to become sub-halos
during the entire halo merging history. In both cases, the USMFs are also
independent of the redshift of host halos. Due to tidal disruption, only a
small fraction of the accreted halos survive as sub-halos identifiable in the
present-day dark halos. In cluster-sized halos, about 30% of the survived
sub-halos are sub-subhalos, and this fraction decreases with decreasing halo
mass. For given halo and sub-halo masses, the accretion time has very broad
distribution, but the survived sub-halos are all accreted quite recently.

generalized to arbitrary discrete memoryless channels. Specifically, it is
shown that when the input alphabet size is a prime number, a similar
construction to that for the binary case leads to polarization. This method can
be extended to channels of composite input alphabet sizes by decomposing such
channels into a set of channels with prime input alphabet sizes. It is also
shown that all discrete memoryless channels can be polarized by randomized
constructions. The introduction of randomness does not change the order of
complexity of polar code construction, encoding, and decoding. A previous
result on the error probability behavior of polar codes is also extended to the
case of arbitrary discrete memoryless channels. The generalization of
polarization to channels with arbitrary finite input alphabet sizes leads to
polar-coding methods for approaching the true (as opposed to symmetric) channel
capacity of arbitrary channels with discrete or continuous input alphabets.

interactions allow for solutions with nontrivial phase structure in infinite

such phase structure is disallowed. On the other hand, such
non-nearest-neighbor interactions can critically affect the stability of

  We will investigate and partially solve this problem in the context of the

amplitude of 1-2 km/s, the relative intensity amplitude of 3%-5% and the

about 70-90 Mm, much longer than those of the 5 min wave previously detected by
TRACE. This difference may be explained by the dependence of damping length on
the wave period for thermal conduction. Based on a linear wave theory, we

Using laser guide star adaptive optics in conjunction with the integral field
spectrograph, OSIRIS, at the Keck II telescope, we are able to differentiate
between the older, late-type ($\sim$ 1 Gyr) stars, which are presumed to be
dynamically relaxed, and the unrelaxed young ($\sim$ 6 Myr) population. This
distinction is crucial for testing models of stellar cusp formation in the
vicinity of a black hole, as the models assume that the cusp stars are in
dynamical equilibrium in the black hole potential. Based on the late-type stars
alone, the surface stellar number density profile, $\Sigma(R) \propto
R^{-\Gamma}$, is flat, with $\Gamma = -0.27\pm0.19$. Monte Carlo simulations of
the possible de-projected volume density profile, n(r) $\propto r^{-\gamma}$,
show that $\gamma$ is less than 1.0 at the 99.73 % confidence level. These
results are consistent with the nuclear star cluster having no cusp, with a
core profile that is significantly flatter than predicted by most cusp
formation theories, and even allows for the presence of a central hole in the
stellar distribution. Of the possible dynamical interactions that can lead to
the depletion of the red giants observable in this survey -- stellar
collisions, mass segregation from stellar remnants, or a recent merger event --
mass segregation is the only one that can be ruled out as the dominant
depletion mechanism. The lack of a stellar cusp around a supermassive black
hole would have important implications for black hole growth models and
inferences on the presence of a black hole based upon stellar distributions.

requirements of combining excellent isolation to avoid decoherence with the
ability to control coherent interactions in a many-body quantum system. For
example, spin degrees of freedom of electrons and nuclei provide a good quantum
memory due to their weak magnetic interactions with the environment. However,
for the same reason it is difficult to achieve controlled entanglement of spins
over distances larger than tens of nanometers. Here we propose a universal
realization of a quantum data bus for electronic spin qubits where spins are
coupled to the motion of magnetized mechanical resonators via magnetic field
gradients. Provided that the mechanical system is charged, the magnetic moments
associated with spin qubits can be effectively amplified to enable a coherent
spin-spin coupling over long distances via Coulomb forces. Our approach is
applicable to a wide class of electronic spin qubits which can be localized
near the magnetized tips and can be used for the implementation of hybrid
quantum computing architectures.

week collision conditions. As a result thermal conduction by ions has a
considerable contribution in transfer of the realized heat in accretion
mechanisms. We study a 2D advective accretion disk bathed in a poloidal
magnetic field of a central accretor in the presence of thermal conduction. We
find self-similar solutions for an axisymmetric, rotating, steady,

[O III] FWHM as a proxy for sigma. AGN black hole masses, M, estimated using
the Dibai single epoch spectrum method, are combined with the new estimates of
sigma to give a revised AGN M-sigma relationship extending up to high masses.
This shows that the masses of the most massive black holes are systematically
higher than predicted by extrapolation of M \propto sigma^4 to high masses.
This supports recent suggestions that stellar dynamical masses of the most
massive black holes have been systematically underestimated. The steepening of
the M-sigma relationship is consistent with the absence of very high sigma
galaxies in the local universe and with the curvature of the Faber-Jackson
relationship. There appears to be significantly less intrinsic scatter in the
M-sigma relationship for galaxies with black hole masses > 10^9 solar masses.
It is speculated that this is connected with the core elliptical versus
extra-light elliptical dichotomy. The low scatter in the high end of the
M-sigma relationship implies that the transformation proposed here and the
Dibai method are good indicators of stellar velocity dispersion and mass
respectively. There is no evidence for evolution of the M-sigma relationship

nearest-neighbor interactions, and investigate how the transport properties are
affected by the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter. This
corresponds to an extension of the usual on-site interaction assumption, which
yields an isotropic s-wave order parameter near the Dirac points. Here, we
employ a full numerical solution as well as an analytical treatment, and show
how the proximity effect may induce exotic types of superconducting states near
the Dirac points, e.g. $p_x$- and $p_y$-wave pairing or a combination of s-wave
and $p+\i p$-wave pairing. We find that the Josephson current exhibits a
weakly-damped, oscillatory dependence on the length of the junction when the
graphene sheet is strongly doped. The analytical and numerical treatments are
found to agree well with each other in the s-wave case when calculating the
critical current and current-phase relationship. For the scenarios with
anisotropic superconducting pairing, there is a deviation between the two
treatments, especially for the effective $p_x$-wave order parameter near the

apply this model for a thin self-gravitating disk around newborn stars. Our
result is quite different with standard alpha disks in the outer part of the
disks where the self-gravity becomes important. In the inner part of the disks,
our solution converged to the standard $\alpha$ disks. It has been presented
that for beta model, Toomre parameter is more than unity everywhere which means
that gravitational fragmentation can be occur everywhere. We suggest that the
kind of hydrodynamically driven viscosity, $\beta$-model, can be used for
modeling of accretion disks from proto-stellar disks to AGN and galactic disks.
It would be interest to investigate ADAF-type solution for follow any effects

asymptote to a limiting surface of non-zero areal radius. Our approach is easy
to implement numerically and, at least for non-spinning black holes, does not
require any internal boundary conditions. We present numerical results,
obtained with a uniform-grid finite-difference code, for boosted black holes
and binary black holes. We also comment on generalizations of this method for
spinning black holes.

Bursts (GRBs) broadband afterglow behaviour is still an open issue ad the
standard external shock fireball models cannot easily explain the puzzling
combined temporal and spectral optical to X-ray behaviour of a large number of
afterglows. We analysed the rest frame de-absorbed and K- corrected optical and
X-ray multi-wavelength light-curves of a sample of 33 GRBs with known redshift
and optical extinction at the host frame. We modelled their broadband behaviour
as the sum of the standard forward shock emission due to the interaction of a
fireball with the circum-burst medium and an additional component. We are able
to obtain a good agreement with the observed light-curves despite their
complexity and diversity and can also account for the lack of achromatic late
times jet breaks in several GRBs and explain the presence of chromatic breaks.
Even if the second component is treated in a phenomenological way, we can
identify it as a ""late prompt"" emission due to a prolonged activity of the
central engine produced by a mechanism similar to the one responsible for the
early prompt emission. Our attempt can be considered as a first step towards
the construction of a more physical scenario. A first important hint is that
the ""late prompt"" temporal decay is intriguingly consistent with what expected
with the the accretion rate of fallback material. In order to test our model
also from the spectral point of view, we analysed the X-ray time resolved
spectra and when possible the evolution of the optical to X-ray spectral energy
distribution. All the events are found to be fully consistent with what
predicted by our model.

degeneracy between curvature and dark energy in the distance-redshift relation
typically requires either making strong assumptions about the dark energy
evolution or sacrificing precision in a more model-independent approach.
Measurements of the redshift evolution of the linear growth of perturbations
can break the geometric degeneracy, providing curvature constraints that are
both precise and model-independent. Future supernova, CMB, and cluster data
have the potential to measure the curvature with an accuracy of
sigma(Omega_K)=0.002, without specifying a particular dark energy
phenomenology. In combination with distance measurements, the evolution of the
growth function at low redshifts provides the strongest curvature constraint if
the high-redshift universe is well approximated as being purely matter
dominated. However, in the presence of early dark energy or massive neutrinos,
the precision in curvature is reduced due to additional degeneracies, and
precise normalization of the growth function relative to recombination is
important for obtaining accurate constraints. Curvature limits from distances
and growth compare favorably to other approaches to curvature estimation
proposed in the literature, providing either greater accuracy or greater
freedom from dark energy modeling assumptions, and are complementary due to the
use of independent data sets. Model-independent estimates of curvature are
critical for both testing inflation and obtaining unbiased constraints on dark
energy parameters.

Simple mid-infrared selection criteria were used to exclude most normal and

the LMC that could potentially be YSOs. We then simultaneously considered
images and photometry from the optical through mid-IR wavelengths to assess the
source morphology, spectral energy distribution (SED), and the surrounding
interstellar environment to determine the most likely nature of each source.
  From this examination of the initial sample, we suggest 1,172 sources are
most likely YSOs and 1,075 probable background galaxies, consistent with
expectations based on SWIRE survey data. Spitzer IRS observations of 269 of the
brightest YSOs from our sample have confirmed that ~>95% are indeed YSOs.
  A comprehensive search for YSOs in the LMC has also been carried out by the
SAGE team. There are three major differences between these two searches. (1) In
the common region of color-magnitude space, ~850 of our 1,172 probable YSOs are
missed in the SAGE YSO catalog because their conservative point source
identification criteria have excluded YSOs superposed on complex diffuse
emission. (2) About 20-30% of the YSOs identified by the SAGE team are sources
we classify as background galaxies. (3) the SAGE YSO catalog identifies YSO in
parts of color-magnitude space that we excluded and thus contains more evolved
or fainter YSOs missed by our analysis. Finally, the mid-IR luminosity
functions of our most likely YSO candidates in the LMC can be well described by
N(L) propto L^-1, which is consistent with the Salpeter initial mass function
if a mass-luminosity relation of L propto M^2.4 is adopted.

be quantized, not at least because of the inconsistency of semi-classical
theories of gravity. If this means to quantize GR, its identification of the
gravitational field with the spacetime metric has to be taken into account. And
the resulting quantum theory has to be background-independent. This can not be

strategies have to be applied. One of the basic requirements for such a
quantization strategy is that the resulting quantum theory has GR as a
classical limit. - However, should gravity not be a fundamental, but an
residual, emergent interaction, it could very well be an intrinsically
classical phenomenon. Should QM be nonetheless universally valid, we had to
assume a quantum substrate from which gravity would result as an emergent
classical phenomenon. And there would be no conflict with the arguments against
semi-classical theories, because there would be no gravity at all on the
substrate level. The gravitational field would not have any quantum properties,
and a quantization of GR would not lead to any fundamental theory. The
objective of a theory of 'QG' would instead be the identification of the
quantum substrate from which gravity results. - The paper tries to give an
overview over the main options for theory construction in the field of QG.
Because of the still unclear status of gravity and spacetime, it pleads for the
necessity of a plurality of conceptually different approaches to QG.

work, we assume that the utility of a client is a function of the delivery
ratio it obtains. We treat the delivery ratio for a client as a tunable
parameter by the access point (AP), instead of a given value as in the previous
work. We then study how the AP should assign delivery ratios to clients so that
the total utility of all clients is maximized.
  We apply the techniques introduced in two previous papers to decompose the
utility maximization problem into two simpler problems, a CLIENT problem and an
ACCESS-POINT problem. We show that this decomposition actually describes a
bidding game, where clients bid for the service time from the AP. We prove that
although all clients behave selfishly in this game, the resulting equilibrium
point of the game maximizes the total utility. In addition, we also establish
an efficient scheduling policy for the AP to reach the optimal point of the
ACCESS-POINT problem. We prove that the policy not only approaches the optimal
point but also achieves some forms of fairness among clients. Finally,
simulation results show that our proposed policy does achieve higher utility

Regge-Teitelboim dynamics ""a la string"" (R-T); it arises when variation of the
4-spaces gives the Euler-Lagrange equations of a multicontact field theory. We
calculate the Cartan character table of this EDS, showing the field equations
to be well posed with no gauge freedom. The Hilbert Lagrangian as usually
varied over just the intrinsic curvature structure of a 4-space yields only a
subset of this dynamics, viz., solutions satisfying additional conditions
constraining them to be Ricci-flat. In the static spherically symmetric case we
present a new tetrad embedding in flat six dimensions, which allows reduction
of the R-T field equations to a quadrature; the Schwarzschild metric is a
special case. As has previously been noted there may be a classical
correspondence of R-T theory with the hidden dimensions of brane theory, and
perhaps this extended general relativistic dynamics holds in extreme
circumstances where it can be interpreted as including a sort of dark or bulk
energy, even though no term with a cosmological constant is included in the
Lagrangian. As a multicontact system, canonical quantization should be
straightforward.

theory based on quantum logic represented by the lattice of closed linear
subspaces of a Hilbert space in a manner analogous to Boolean-valued models of
set theory, and showed that appropriate counterparts of the axioms of
Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice (ZFC) hold in the model.
In this paper, we aim at unifying Takeuti's model with Boolean-valued models by
constructing models based on general complete orthomodular lattices, and
generalizing the transfer principle in Boolean-valued models, which asserts
that every theorem in ZFC set theory holds in the models, to a general form
holding in every orthomodular-valued model. One of the central problems in this
program is the well-known arbitrariness in choosing a binary operation for
implication. To clarify what properties are required to obtain the generalized
transfer principle, we introduce a class of binary operations extending the
implication on Boolean logic, called generalized implications, including even
non-polynomially definable operations. We study the properties of those
operations in detail and show that all of them admit the generalized transfer
principle. Moreover, we determine all the polynomially definable operations for
which the generalized transfer principle holds. This result allows us to
abandon the Sasaki arrow originally assumed for Takeuti's model and leads to a
much more flexible approach to quantum set theory.

states that the probability that none of a set of bad events happens is nonzero
if the probability of each event is small compared to the number of events that
depend on it. It is often used in combination with the probabilistic method for
non-constructive existence proofs. A prominent application is to k-CNF
formulas, where LLL implies that, if every clause in the formula shares
variables with at most d <= 2^k/e other clauses then such a formula has a
satisfying assignment. Recently, a randomized algorithm to efficiently
construct a satisfying assignment was given by Moser. Subsequently Moser and
Tardos gave a randomized algorithm to construct the structures guaranteed by
the LLL in a very general algorithmic framework. We address the main problem
left open by Moser and Tardos of derandomizing these algorithms efficiently.
Specifically, for a k-CNF formula with m clauses and d <= 2^{k/(1+\eps)}/e for
any \eps\in (0,1), we give an algorithm that finds a satisfying assignment in
time \tilde{O}(m^{2(1+1/\eps)}). This improves upon the deterministic
algorithms of Moser and of Moser-Tardos with running time m^{\Omega(k^2)} which
is superpolynomial for k=\omega(1) and upon other previous algorithms which
work only for d\leq 2^{k/16}/4. Our algorithm works efficiently for a general

mathematical theory defining the multiplication of tensor distributions in a
geometric (diffeomorphism invariant) way. Significant progress has been made
through the concept of Colombeau algebras, and the construction of full
Colombeau algebras on differential manifolds for arbitrary tensors. Despite the
fact that this goal was achieved, it does not incorporate clearly enough the
concept of covariant derivative and hence is of a limited use. We take a
different approach: we consider any type of preference for smooth distributions
(on a smooth manifold) as nonintuitive, which means all our approach must be
based fully on the Colombeau equivalence relation as the fundamental feature of
the theory. After taking this approach we very naturally obtain a canonical and
geometric theory defining tensorial operations with tensorial distributions,
including covariant derivative. This also happens because we no longer need any
explicit canonical geometric construction of Colombeau algebras. The big
advantage of our approach lies also in the fact that it brings a physical
insight into the mathematical concepts used and naturally leads to formulation
of physics on (what we call) piecewise smooth manifolds, rather than on smooth
manifold. This brings to the language of physics much higher symmetry (in the
same way as turning from Poincare invariance to diffeomorphism invariance), and
is compatible with our intuition, that ""pointwise"" properties in some
metaphorical sense ""do not matter"".

cusp-like feature. We have revealed that these apparent ``cusps'' were most
likely mimicked by twisted magnetic flux ropes, but unlikely to be related to
the inverted Y-like magnetic configuration in the standard flare model. The
ropes originated inside a funnel-like magnetic domain whose base was bounded by
an EUV ring structure, and the top was associated with a coronal null point.
The ropes appear to be the major drivers for the events, but their rise was not
triggered by reconnection in the coronal null point. We propose a scenario and
a three-dimensional scheme for these events in which the filament eruptions and
flares were caused by interaction of the ropes.

we find that (1) microwave emissions might be optically thick at high

presumably due to the inhomogeneity of the emitting source; (2) magnetic fields
in high-frequency radio sources might be stronger than sometimes assumed; (3)

(BLR) of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and the role BLRs play in the AGN
phenomenon. The high equivalent widths of the lines imply a high BLR covering
factor, and the absence of clear evidence for absorption by the BLR means that
the BLR has a flattened distribution and that we always view it near pole-on.
The BLR gas is strongly self-shielding near the equatorial plane.
Velocity-resolved reverberation mapping has long strongly excluded significant
outflow of the BLR and shows instead that the predominant motions are Keplerian
with large turbulence and a significant net inflow. The rotation and turbulence
are consistent with the inferred geometry. The blueshifting of high-ionization
lines is a consequence of scattering off inflowing material rather than the
result of an outflowing wind. The rate of inflow of the BLR is sufficient to
provide the accretion rate needed to power the AGN. Because the motions of the
BLR are gravitationally dominated, and the BLR structure is very similar in
most AGNs, consistent black hole masses can be determined. The good correlation
between these estimates and masses predicted from the bulge luminosities of
host galaxies provides strong support for the similarity of AGN continuum
shapes and the correctness of the BLR picture presented. It is concluded that
although many mysteries remain about the details of how AGNs work, a general
overall picture of the torus and BLR is becoming clear.

amino acids of the polypeptide sequence are partitioned mostly into the
membrane interior and hydrophilic amino acids mostly into the aqueous exterior.
We analyze the minimum free energy state of polypeptide sequences partitioned
into alpha-helical transmembrane (TM) segments and the role of thermal
fluctuations using a many-body statistical mechanics model. Results suggest
that IMP TM segment partitioning shares important features with general
theories of protein folding. For random polypeptide sequences, the minimum free
energy state at room temperature is characterized by fluctuations in the number
of TM segments with very long relaxation times. Simple assembly scenarios do
not produce a unique number of TM segments and jamming phenomena interfere with
segment placement. For sequences corresponding to IMPs, the minimum free energy
structure with the wildtype number of segments is free of number fluctuations
due to an anomalous gap in the energy spectrum, and simple assembly scenarios
produce this structure. There is a threshold number of random point mutations
beyond which the size of this gap is reduced so that the wildtype groundstate
is destabilized and number fluctuations reappear.

ferromagnetism stems from ferromagnetic precipitates or spinodal decomposition

diluted magnetic semiconductor. In the present paper we answer this question
for Fe-implanted ZnO single crystals comprehensively. Different implantation
fluences and temperatures and post-implantation annealing temperatures have
been chosen in order to evaluate the structural and magnetic properties over a
wide range of parameters. Three different regimes with respect to the Fe
concentration and the process temperature are found: 1) Disperse Fe$^{2+}$ and
Fe$^{3+}$ at low Fe concentrations and low processing temperatures, 2)
FeZn$_2$O$_4$ at very high processing temperatures and 3) an intermediate
regime with a co-existence of metallic Fe (Fe$^0$) and ionic Fe (Fe$^{2+}$ and
Fe$^{3+}$). Ferromagnetism is only observed in the latter two cases, where
inverted ZnFe$_2$O$_4$ and $\alpha$-Fe nanocrystals are the origin of the
observed ferromagnetic behavior, respectively. The ionic Fe in the last case
could contribute to a carrier mediated coupling. However, their separation is
too large to couple ferromagnetically due to the lack of p-type carrier. For
comparison investigations of Fe-implanted epitaxial ZnO thin films are

construct a method form-fitting to any type of finite volume or finite

macroscopic methods for the limiting fluid equations, we show how it is

traditional deterministic/stochastic methods for the full kinetic equations. In
addition, due to the hybrid nature of the schemes, the numerical solution is
affected by less fluctuations when compared to standard Monte Carlo schemes.

in disordered systems as they approach non-ergodic or jammed states. It is
characterized in terms of dynamical heterogeneity, facilitation and excitation
lines. These features are associated with a newly discovered class of
non-equilibrium phase transitions. Equilibrium properties have little if
anything to do with it. The broken symmetries of these transitions are obscure
or absent in spatial structures, but they are vivid in space-time (i.e.,
trajectory space). In our view, the glass transition is an example of this
class of transitions. The basic ideas and principles we review were originally
developed through the analysis of idealized and abstract models. Nevertheless,
the central ideas are easily illustrated with reference to molecular dynamics
of more realistic atomistic models, and we use that illustrative approach here.

where the amount of work an agent can extract depends on how well it can guess
the micro-state of the system. In general it depends both on the agent's
knowledge and risk-tolerance, because the agent can bet on facts that are not
certain and thereby risk failure of the work extraction. We derive strikingly
simple expressions for the extractable work in the extreme cases of effectively
zero- and arbitrary risk tolerance respectively, thereby enveloping all cases.
Our derivation makes a connection between heat engines and the smooth entropy

an analogous extension of statistical mechanics.

the processes taking place were sufficiently violent. The spectra of several of
these gravitational wave backgrounds on subhorizon scales have been extensively
studied in the literature. In this paper we analyze the shape and amplitude of
the gravitational wave spectrum on scales which are superhorizon at the time of
production. Such gravitational waves are expected from the self ordering of
randomly oriented scalar fields which can be present during a thermal phase
transition or during preheating after hybrid inflation. We find that, if the
gravitational wave source acts only during a small fraction of the Hubble time,
the gravitational wave spectrum at frequencies lower than the expansion rate at
the time of production behaves as $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f) \propto f^3$ with an
amplitude much too small to be observable by gravitational wave observatories
like LIGO, LISA or BBO. On the other hand, if the source is active for a much
longer time, until a given mode which is initially superhorizon ($k\eta_* \ll
1$), enters the horizon, for $k\eta \gtrsim 1$, we find that the gravitational
wave energy density is frequency independent, i.e. scale invariant. Moreover,
its amplitude for a GUT scale scenario turns out to be within the range and
sensitivity of BBO and marginally detectable by LIGO and LISA. This new
gravitational wave background can compete with the one generated during
inflation, and distinguishing both may require extra information.

incorporated in Titan's planetesimals before its formation. Here, we point out
that serpentinization reactions in Titan's interior are not able to reproduce
the deuterium over hydrogen (D/H) ratio observed at present in methane in its
atmosphere, and would require a maximum D/H ratio in Titan's water ice 30%
lower than the value likely acquired by the satellite during its formation,
based on Cassini observations at Enceladus. Alternatively, production of
methane in Titan's interior via radiolytic reactions with water can be
envisaged but the associated production rates remain uncertain. On the other
hand, a mechanism that easily explains the presence of large amounts of methane
trapped in Titan in a way consistent with its measured atmospheric D/H ratio is
its direct capture in the satellite's planetesimals at the time of their
formation in the solar nebula. In this case, the mass of methane trapped in
Titan's interior can be up to 1,300 times the current mass of atmospheric
methane.

law (SPL) spectral states in black hole X-ray binaries is proposed. The
low/hard state is explained by the development of a magnetically arrested
accretion disk attributable to the accumulation of a vertical magnetic field in
a central bundle. This disk forms powerful jets and consists of thin spiral
accretion streams of a dense optically thick plasma surrounded by hot,
magnetized, optically thin corona, which emits most of the energy in hard
X-rays. State transition occurs because of the quasi-periodic or random
inversion of poloidal magnetic fields in the accretion flow supplied by the
secondary star. The inward advection of the inverted field results in a
temporal disappearance of the central bundle caused by the annihilation of the
opposed fields and restoration of the optically thick disk in the innermost
region. This disk represents the high/soft state. The SPL state develops at the
period of intensive field annihilation and precedes the high/soft state. The
continuous supply of the inverted field leads to a new low/hard state because
of the formation of another magnetically arrested disk.

expressions for all isosceles triangle configurations in Fourier space. Their
overall amplitude is amplified as the inverse cube of the angle and diverges
for flat triangles. The isosceles configurations generically lead to a negative
bispectrum with a power law decay l^(-6) for large multipole l. However,
collapsed triangles are found to be associated with a positive bispectrum
whereas the squeezed triangles still exhibit negative values. We then compare
our analytical estimates to a direct computation of the bispectrum from a set
of 300 statistically independent temperature maps obtained from Nambu-Goto
cosmic string simulations in a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW)

behaviour and angle dependency of the various triangle configurations. At l~500
the cosmic string GKS effect contributes approximately the same equilateral CMB
bispectrum amplitude as an inflationary model with |fNL|~10^3, if the strings
contribute about 10% of the temperature power spectrum at l=10. Current bounds
on fNL are not derived using cosmic string bispectrum templates, and so our fNL

that string bispectrum templates should be included in the search of CMB

photon-beam asymmetries and compare them to recent LEPS data. We adapt a
Regge-plus-resonance (RPR) model developed to describe photoinduced and
electroinduced kaon production off protons. The non-resonant contributions to
the amplitude are modelled in terms of K+(494) and K*+(892) Regge-trajectory
exchange. This amplitude is supplemented with a selection of s-channel
resonance diagrams. The three Regge-model parameters of the n(gamma,K+)Sigma-
amplitude are derived from the ones fitted to proton data through SU(2) isospin
considerations. A fair description of the n(gamma,K+)Sigma- data is realized,
which demonstrates the Regge model's robustness and predictive power.
Conversion of the resonances' couplings from the proton to the neutron is more
challenging, as it requires knowledge of the photocoupling helicity amplitudes.
We illustrate how the uncertainties of the helicity amplitudes propagate and
heavily restrain the predictive power of the RPR and isobar models for kaon
production off neutron targets.

time-periodic perturbation of a one-dimensional Hamiltonian system possessing a
separatrix, which is one of the major unsolved problems in the theory of
separatrix chaos. For a given small amplitude of the perturbation, the width is
shown to possess sharp peaks in the range from logarithmically small to
moderate frequencies. These peaks are universal, being the consequence of the
involvement of the nonlinear resonance dynamics into the separatrix chaotic
motion. Developing further the approach introduced in the recent paper by
Soskin et al. ({\it PRE} {\bf 77}, 036221 (2008)), we derive leading-order
asymptotic expressions for the shape of the low-frequency peaks. The maxima of
the peaks, including in particular the {\it absolute maximum} of the width, are
proportional to the perturbation amplitude times either a logarithmically large
factor or a numerical, still typically large, factor, depending on the type of

interaction of stellar and disk winds with surrounding infalling cloud
material. The star, and its accompanying disk, blow winds inside a cavity
cleared out by an earlier jet. The collision of the winds with their
surroundings generates shock heated plasma which reaches temperatures up to
~10^8 K. Attenuated X-ray spectra are calculated from solving the equation of
radiative transfer along lines-of-sight. This process is repeated at various
epochs throughout the simulations to examine the evolution of the intrinsic and
attenuated flux. We find that the dynamic nature of the wind-cavity interaction
fuels intrinsic variability in the observed emission on timescales of several
hundred years. This is principally due to variations in the position of the
reverse shock which is influenced by changes in the shape of the cavity wall.
The collision of the winds with the cavity wall can cause clumps of cloud
material to be stripped away. Mixing of these clumps into the winds mass-loads
the flow and enhances the X-ray emission measure. The position and shape of the
reverse shock plays a key role in determining the strength and hardness of the
X-ray emission. In some models the reverse shock is oblique to much of the
stellar and disk outflows, whereas in others it is closely normal over a wide
range of polar angles. For reasonable stellar and disk wind parameters the
integrated count rate and spatial extent of the intensity peak for X-ray
emission agree with \textit{Chandra} observations of the deeply embedded MYSOs

Dirac mass matrix present in the usual seesaw case. This is a considerable
reduction of parameters in the neutrino sector and predicts a strong
hierarchical pattern in the right handed neutrino mass matrix that is easily
derived from a $U(1)_H$ family symmetry. The model is based on the left-right
gauge group with an additional $Z_4$ discrete symmetry which gives vanishing
neutrino Dirac masses and finite Majorana masses arising at the one loop level.
Furthermore, it is one of the few models that naturally allow for large (but
not necessarily maximal) mixing angles in the lepton sector. A generalization
of the model to the quark sector requires three iso-spin singlet vector-like
down type quarks, as in $E_6$. The model predicts an inert doublet type scalar

operating at room temperature and modest power levels represents one of the
critical challeges that must be overcome to realize truly practical
applications based on THz. Up to now, the most efficient approaches to THz
generation at room temperature -- relying mainly on optical rectification
schemes -- require intricate phase-matching set-ups and powerful lasers. Here
we show how the unique light-confining properties of triply-resonant photonic
resonators can be tailored to enable dramatic enhancements of the conversion
efficiency of THz generation via nonlinear frequency down-conversion processes.
We predict that this approach can be used to reduce up to three orders of
magnitude the pump powers required to reach quantum-limited conversion
efficiency of THz generation in nonlinear optical material systems.
Furthermore, we propose a realistic design readily accesible experimentally,
both for fabrication and demonstration of optimal THz conversion efficiency at
sub-W power levels.

3.6cm, 1.3cm, 7mm, and H2O maser and NH3 lines, and observations with the NASA
70m antenna in CCS and H2O maser. The cm and mm continuum emission, together
with the near infrared data from the 2MASS allowed us to identify 3 YSOs, IRS1,
VLA8A, and VLA8B, with different radio and infrared properties, and which seem
to be in different evolutionary stages. The NH3 emission consists of three
clouds. Two of these, MM1 and MM2, are associated with dust emission, while the
southern cloud is only detected in NH3. The YSOs are embedded in MM1, where we
found evidence of line broadening and temperature enhancements. On the other
hand, the southern cloud and MM2 appear to be quiescent and starless. We
modeled the radial intensity profile at 1.2mm of MM1. The model fits reasonably
well the data, but it underestimates the intensity at small projected distances
from the 1.2mm peak, probably due to the presence of multiple YSOs embedded in
the envelope. There is a differentiation in the relative NH3 abundance with low
values, ~2x10^-8, toward MM1, and high values, up to 10^-6, toward the southern
cloud and MM2, suggesting that these clouds could be in a young evolutionary
stage. IRAS 00213+6530 is harboring a multiple system of low-mass protostars,
indicating that star formation in this cloud is taking place in groups, rather
than in isolation. The low-mass YSOs found in IRAS 00213+6530 are in different
evolutionary stages suggesting that star formation is taking place in different
episodes.

Process in Quantum Mechanics, which takes into account: 1. the finite and non
zero time duration T of the interaction between the observed system and the
microscopic part of the measurement apparatus; 2. the finite space size R of
that apparatus; 3. the fact that the macroscopic part of the measurement
apparatus, having the role of amplifying the effect of that interaction to a
macroscopic scale, is composed by a very large but finite number N of
particles. The conventional picture of the measurement, as an instantaneous
action turning a pure state into a mixture, arises only in the limit in which N
and R tend to infinity, and T tends to 0. We sketch here a proposed scheme,
which still ought to be made mathematically precise in order to analyse its
implications and to test it in specific models, where we argue that in Quantum
Field Theory this picture should apply to the unique time evolution expressing
the dynamics of a given theory, and should comply with the Principle of
Locality. We comment on the Einstein Podolski Rosen thought experiment (partly
modifying the discussion on this point in an earlier version of this note),
reformulated here only in terms of local observables (rather than global ones,
as one particle or polarisation observables). The local picture of the
measurement process helps to make it clear that there is no conflict with the
Principle of Locality.
