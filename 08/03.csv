chiral symmetry breaking and quark confinement. We also introduce a new order
parameter for the confinement phase transition, which is related to the quark
density. It is easily accessible by different theoretical approaches, such as
functional approaches or lattice simulations. Its relation to the Polyakov loop
expectation value is discussed and the QCD phase diagram is analysed. Our
results suggest a close relation between the chiral and the confinement phase

ksec Suzaku observation of the Seyfert-1 galaxy Fairall 9. The source is
clearly detected out to 30 keV. The observed spectrum is fairly simple; it is
well-described by a power-law with a soft excess and disk reflection. A broad
iron line is detected, and easily separated from distinct narrow components
owing to the resolution of the CCDs in the X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XIS).
The broad line is revealed to be asymmetric, consistent with a disk origin. We
fit the XIS and Hard X-ray Detector (HXD) spectra with relativistically-blurred
disk reflection models. With the assumption that the inner disk extends to the
innermost stable circular orbit, the best-fit model implies a black hole spin
parameter of a = 0.60(7) and excludes extremal values at a high level of
confidence. We discuss this result in the context of Seyfert observations and
models of the cosmic distribution of black hole spin.

line of H2 at 2.12 micron with a spatial resolution of ~0.45 arcsec. At the
resulting velocity resolution of ~6 km s-1, multiple slit oriented observations
of the northern first knot NK1 clearly show double-peaked line profiles
consistent with either a radiative bow shock or dual (forward and reverse)
shocks. In contrast, the velocity distribution of the southern first knot SK1
remains single-peaked, suggesting a significantly lower jet velocity and
possibly a different density variation in the jet pulses in the southern flow
compared to the northern flow. Comparison with a semi-empirical analytical
model of bow shock emission allows us to constrain parameters such as the bow
inclination to the line of sight, the bow shock and jet velocities for each
flow. Although a few features are not reproduced by this model, it confirms the
presence of several dynamical and kinematical asymmetries between opposite
sides of the HH 212 bipolar jet. The position-velocity diagrams of both knots
exhibit complex dynamics that are broadly consistent with emission from a bow
shock and/or jet shock, which does not exclude jet rotation, although a clear
signature of jet rotation in HH 212 is missing. Alternative interpretations of
the variation of radial velocity across these knots, such as a variation in the
jet orientation, as well as for the velocity asymmetries between the flows, are
also considered. The presence of a correlation between flow velocity and
collimation in each flow is suggested.

elucidate the complex web of interacting genes and proteins. These efforts

recourse to information theory, this study proposes a mathematical approach to
reconstruct gene regulatory networks at coarse-grain level from high throughput

that a given gene regulates positively, negatively or does not regulate each
one of the network genes. This approach also allows the introduction of prior

genes to be perturbed in subsequent experiments in order to refine the
knowledge about the architecture of an underlying gene regulatory network. The

Starting from the usual expression of the partition function of N molecules, a
Fourier transformation is performed. It is argued that the N(N-1)/2 dynamical
variables kpq in the reciprocal space featuring the link between 2 molecules p
and q can reasonably be considered independent in the thermodynamical limit.
Treated as a set of effective independent particles, their statistical
behaviour is analogous to a Bose-Einstein gas. Expressions of the partition
function, of the radial pair correlation function and of the pressure are
derived, and a special attention is given to the mathematical inter-consistency
of those quantities. The results, which are independent of the exact shape of
the intermolecular potential, are applied to the simple case of hard sphere
fluids. An analytical expression of the radial pair correlation function is
derived as well as of the equation of state. The model predicts a qualitatively
satisfactory behaviour for g(R), and it provides numerically correct values for
the equation of state at low and medium densities, although at higher densities
the contact value of g(R)is underestimated. Quite interestingly it predicts for
the maximum random close packing density the correct value 0.637 .

consistency and synchronization among the correct nodes and then operate in
coordinated rounds of information exchange to reach agreement based on the
input values. The implicit initial assumptions enable correct nodes to infer
about the progression of the algorithm at other nodes from their local state.
This paper considers a more severe fault model than permanent Byzantine
failures, one in which the system can in addition be subject to severe
transient failures that can temporarily throw the system out of its assumption
boundaries. When the system eventually returns to behave according to the
presumed assumptions it may be in an arbitrary state in which any
synchronization among the nodes might be lost, and each node may be at an
arbitrary state. We present a self-stabilizing Byzantine agreement algorithm
that reaches agreement among the correct nodes in an optimal ration of faulty
to correct, by using only the assumption of eventually bounded message
transmission delay. In the process of solving the problem, two additional
important and challenging building blocks were developed: a unique
self-stabilizing protocol for assigning consistent relative times to protocol
initialization and a Reliable Broadcast primitive that progresses at the speed
of actual message delivery time.

and highly flattened. In many cases, these triaxial equilibria are also
tumbling slowly, typically about their short axes, with periods of order a
Hubble time. Halos may therefore exert a slowly changing external torque on
spiral galaxies that can affect their dynamical evolution in interesting ways.
We examine the effect of the external torques exerted by a tumbling quadrupolar
tidal field on the evolution of spiral galaxies using N-body simulations with
realistic, disk galaxy models. We measure the amplitude of the external
quadrupole moments of dark halos in cosmological simulations and use these to
force disk galaxy models in a series of N-body experiments for a range of
pattern speeds. We find that the torques are strong enough to induce long lived
transient warps in disks similar to those observed in real spirals and also
induce the bar instability at later times in some galaxy models that are
otherwise stable for long periods of time in isolation. We also observe forced
spiral structure near the edge of the disk where normally self-gravity is too
weak to be responsible for such structure. This overlooked influence of dark
halos may well be responsible for many of the peculiar aspects of disk galaxy

anharmonic system can not overlap. As a consequence, the asymptotic solutions
can be constant, periodic,quasiperiodic or almost periodic, and possibly weakly
chaotic. For a sinusoidal trajectory with frequency $\Omega$ we find that the
energy $E_T$ transferred to the harmonic system up to time $T$ is proportional
to $T^{\alpha}$. If $\Omega$ equals one of the phonon frequencies $\omega_\nu$,
it is $\alpha=2$. We prove that there is a full measure set such that for
$\Omega$ in this set it is $\alpha=0$, i.e. there is no energy dissipation.
Under certain conditions there exists a zero measure set such that for $\Omega

\alpha < 1)$ or superdissipative $(1 <\alpha \leq 2)$. Consequently, the
harmonic bath does act as an anomalous thermostat. Intraband discrete breathers
are such solutions which do not relax. We prove for arbitrary anharmonicity and
small but finite coupling that intraband discrete breathers with frequency
$\Omega$ exist for all $\Omega$ in a Cantor set $\mathcal{C}(k)$ of finite
Lebesgue measure. This is achieved by estimating the contribution of small
denominators appearing in the memory kernel. For $\Omega\in\mathcal{C}(k)$ the

many-body quantum systems. One approach is to use macroscopic, effectively
thermodynamic ensembles of ultracold atoms to create quantum gases and strongly
correlated states of matter, and to analyze the bulk properties of the
ensemble. The opposite approach is to build up microscopic quantum systems atom
by atom - with complete control over all degrees of freedom. Until now, the
macroscopic and microscopic strategies have been fairly disconnected. Here, we
present a ""quantum gas microscope"" that bridges the two approaches, realizing a
system where atoms of a macroscopic ensemble are detected individually and a
complete set of degrees of freedom of each of them is determined through
preparation and measurement. By implementing a high-resolution optical imaging
system, single atoms are detected with near-unity fidelity on individual sites
of a Hubbard regime optical lattice. The lattice itself is generated by
projecting a holographic mask through the imaging system. It has an arbitrary
geometry, chosen to support both strong tunnel coupling between lattice sites
and strong on-site confinement. On one hand, this new approach can be used to
directly detect strongly correlated states of matter. On the other hand, the
quantum gas microscope opens the door for the addressing and read-out of
large-scale quantum information systems with ultracold atoms.

Berenices (Melotte 111) open cluster, using data obtained as part of the
SuperWASP exoplanetary transit-search programme. The goal of the Coma survey
was to measure precise rotation periods for main-sequence F, G and K dwarfs in
this intermediate-age (~600 Myr) cluster, and to determine the extent to which
magnetic braking has caused the stellar spin periods to converge. We find a
tight, almost linear relationship between rotation period and J-K colour with a
root-mean square scatter of only 2 percent. The relation is similar to that
seen among F, G and K stars in the Hyades. Such strong convergence can only be
explained if angular momentum is not at present being transferred from a
reservoir in the deep stellar interiors to the surface layers. We conclude that
the coupling timescale for angular momentum transport from a rapidly-spinning
radiative core to the outer convective zone must be substantially shorter than
the cluster age, and that from the age of Coma onward, stars rotate effectively
as solid bodies. The existence of a tight relationship between stellar mass and
rotation period at a given age supports the use of stellar rotation period as
an age indicator in F, G and K stars of Hyades age and older. We demonstrate
that individual stellar ages can be determined within the Coma population with
an internal precision of order 9 percent (RMS), using a standard magnetic
braking law in which rotation period increases with the square root of stellar
age. We find that a slight modification to the magnetic-braking power law, P
proportional to t^0.56, yields rotational and asteroseismological ages in good
agreement for the Sun and other stars of solar age for which p-mode studies and
photometric rotation periods have been published.

able to ionize hydrogen in the inter-galactic medium (IGM) is a critical
parameter in analyses of the reionization era and early galaxy formation.
Studies of the reionization history normally suffer from a degeneracy between
the unknown values for the efficiency with which high redshift galaxies turn
mass into stars and the escape fraction of ionizing photons. Recent gamma-ray
burst (GRB) measurements of the star formation rate density during reionization
provide the first opportunity to break this degeneracy. We confront a
semi-analytic model for reionization with the GRB-derived star formation rate,
as well as observations of the Ly-alpha forest and the CMB. Assuming that UV
photons produced in star-forming galaxies dominate the reionization process, we
show that the escape fraction of ionizing photons from high redshift galaxies
is ~5% [log(f_esc)=-1.35+/-0.15 (68%)] for our fiducial model. This value is
reasonably stable against uncertainties in the modeling, including the

one of the most interesting and studied problems of heavy-ion physics. A new

presented here which accounts for the repulsive hard-core interactions arising
due to the geometrical size of the baryons. A first order deconfining phase
transition is obtained using Gibbs' equilibrium criteria and a bag model EOS
for the weakly interacting quark matter. It is interesting to find that the

find that our composite H-alpha+IR based SFRs are in excellent agreement with
attenuation-corrected SFRs derived from integrated spectrophotometry, over the
full range of SFRs (0.01 -- 80 solar mass per year) and attenuations (0 -- 2.5

H-alpha measurements with monochromatic luminosities at 24 micron and 8 micron
perform nearly as well. The calibrations differ significantly from those
obtained for HII regions (Calzetti et al. 2007), with the difference
attributable to a more evolved population of stars heating the dust. Our
results are consistent with a significant component of diffuse dust (the `IR
cirrus' component) that is heated by a non-star-forming population. The same
methodology can be applied to [OII]$\lambda$3727 emission-line measurements,

relativistic center of mass of an isolated system and to describe the
transitions from different conventions for clock synchronization, namely for
the identifications of instantaneous 3-spaces, as gauge transformations. These
problems, stemming from the Lorentz signature of space-time, are a source of
non-locality, which induces a spatial non-separability in relativistic quantum
mechanics, with implications for relativistic entanglement. Then the classical
system of charged particles plus the electro-magnetic field is studied in the
framework of ADM canonical tetrad gravity in asymptotically Minkowskian
space-times admitting the ADM Poincare' group at spatial infinity, which allows
to get the general relativistic extension of the non-inertial rest frames of
special relativity. The use of the York canonical basis allows to disentangle
the tidal degrees of freedom of the gravitational field from the inertial ones.
The York time is the inertial gauge variable describing the general
relativistic remnant of the gauge freedom in clock synchronization. However now
each solution of Einstein's equations dynamically determines a preferred notion
of instantaneous 3-spaces. The linearization of this canonical formulation in
the weak field approximation will allow to find Hamiltonian Post-Minkowskian
gravitational waves with an asymptotic background and without Post-Newtonian

the large frequency separation (Deltanu). We propose to use the observed

properties of galactic red-giant stars through comparison with simulated
distributions based on synthetic stellar populations. We can clearly identify
the bulk of the red giants observed by CoRoT as red-clump stars, i.e.
post-flash core-He-burning stars. The distribution of nu_max and of Deltanu
gives us access to the distribution of the stellar radius and mass, and thus
represent a most promising probe of the age and star formation rate of the
disk, and of the mass-loss rate during the red-giant branch.
  CoRoT observations are supplying seismic constraints for the most populated
class of He-burning stars in the galactic disk. This opens a new access gate to
probing the properties of red-giant stars that, coupled with classical
observations, promises to extend our knowledge of these advanced phases of

solid-solid phase transition of $\alpha$ to $\beta$ Po is underlined: it
induces a lowering in symmetry, from cubic to rhombohedral, with increasing
temperature. This is explained as the result of a delicate balance between
relativistic and entropic effects. Overall agreement with existing experimental
data is very good by state-of-the-art standards. The phonons of Po present Kohn
anomalies, and it is shown that the effect of spin-orbit interactions is the
inverse of that in normal metals: due to the non-spherical nature of the Fermi
Surface, spin-orbit effects reduce nesting and harden most phonon frequencies.

mechanisms, size-limiting fragmentation where particles fragment when exceeding
a maximum size and shear fragmentation, where particles break up when local
shear forces in the flow exceed the binding force of the particle. For
size-limiting fragmentation the steady state is mainly influenced by the
maximum stable particle size, while particle and flow properties only influence
the approach to the steady state. For shear fragmentation both the approach to

There are multiple types of QPO seen in black hole binary (BHB) systems, so we
need to identify which BHB QPO corresponds to the one seen in the AGN. A key
hint is the `hot disc dominated' energy spectrum of REJ1034+396 which is
sufficiently unusual that it suggests a mildly super-Eddington flow, also
favoured by the most recent mass estimates for the AGN. This suggests the 67Hz
QPO seen occasionally in the mildly super-Eddington BHB GRS 1915+105 as the
most likely counterpart, assuming mass scaling of the QPO frequency. This is
supported by the fact that these data from GRS 1915+105 have an energy spectrum
which is also dominated by a `hot disc' component. Here we show that the
underlying broad band power spectral shape and normalisation are also similar,
providing further consistency checks for this identification. Thus the AGN QPO
adds to the growing evidence for a simple mass scaling of the accretion flow
properties between stellar and supermassive black holes.

age, and these are used to isolate and characterize different components of the
M31 halo: (1) several substructures, and (2) the smooth halo. First, we study
M31's halo substructure along the north-west/south-east minor axis out to R ~
100 kpc and the south-west major axis region at R ~ 60 kpc. We confirm two
substructures in the south-east halo reported by Ibata et al. (2007) and
discover two overdense substructures in the north-west halo. We investigate the
properties of these four substructures as well as other structures including
the western shelf and find that differences in stellar populations among these
systems, thereby suggesting each has a different origin. Our statistical
analysis implies that the M31 halo as a whole may contain at least 16
substructures, each with a different origin. Second, we investigate the
properties of an underlying, smooth and extended halo component out to R > 100
kpc. We find that the surface density of this smooth halo can be fitted to a
Hernquist model of scale radius ~ 17 kpc or a power-law profile with ~ R^{-2.17
+/- 0.15}. In contrast to the relative smoothness of the halo density profile,
its metallicity distribution appears to be spatially non-uniform with
non-monotonic variations with radius, suggesting that the halo population has
not had sufficient time to dynamically homogenize the accreted populations.
Further implications for the formation of the M31 halo are discussed.

the hard contribution to the total inelastic profile function and obtain

Estimates of the size of double correlation corrections are based on the rate

The spectrum is dominated by strong recombination lines of He- and H-like
transitions from carbon to silicon, as well as by L transitions from FeXVII.
The continuum is strong, especially in the 10 to 20 Angstrom, range. Formal
fits require two optically thin, collisionally ionised plasma components, with
temperatures ~300 and ~640 eV. However, they leave the bulk of the forbidden
components of the He-alpha OVII and NVI triplets unaccounted for. These
features can be explained as being produced by photoionised gas. NGC1365 is
therefore the first obscured AGN, whose high-resolution X-ray spectrum requires
both collisional ionisation and photoionisation. The relative weakness of
photoionisation does not stem from the intrinsic weakness of its AGN, whose
X-ray luminosity is ~10^{42} erg/s. We suggest that it may instead come from
the line-of-sight from the active nucleus to the NLR being blocked by optically
thick matter in the broad line region, at the same time responsible for the
large observed variation of the column density obscuring the X-ray active
nucleus. Alternatively, NGC1365 could host a remarkably luminous nuclear
starburst when compared to the AGN accretion power [abriged].

the ages of the stellar populations found in the diffuse light sampled by the
spectra in both the nuclear and extended regions of the target galaxies. We
find that adequate fits can be obtained using combinations of young stellar
populations (YSPs,t_YSP<=2 Gyr), with ages divided into two groups: very young
stellar populations (VYSPs, t_VYSP <=100 Myr) and intermediate-young stellar
populations (IYSPs, 0.1 < t_IYSP <= 2 Gyr). Our results show that YSPs are
present at all locations of the galaxies covered by our slit positions, with
the exception of the northern nuclear region of the ULIRG IRAS 23327+2913.
Furthermore, VYSPs are presents in at least 85% of the 133 extraction apertures
used for this study. Old stellar populations (OSPs, t_{OSP} > 2 Gyr) do not
make a major contribution to the optical light in the majority of the apertures
extracted. In fact they are essential for fitting the spectra in only 5% (7) of
the extracted apertures. The estimated total masses for the YSPs (VYSPs+IYSPs)
are in the range 0.18 x 10^{10} <= M_YSP <= 50 x 10^{10} Msun. We have also
estimated the bolometric luminosities associated with the stellar populations
detected at optical wavelengths, finding that they fall in the range 0.07 x
10^{12} < L_bol < 2.2 x 10^{12} Lsun. In addition, we find that reddening is
significant at all locations in the galaxies.

gather a large number of additional NLS1s and their broad line counterparts
(BLS1s) and constructed NLS1 and BLS1 sub-samples to compare them in various
ways. The comparison shows a clear separation according to FWHM(H_beta) such
that objects with narrower broad H_beta lines are the strongest PAH emitters.
We test this division in various ways trying to remove biases due to luminosity
and aperture size. Specifically, we find that star formation activity around
NLS1 AGN is larger than around BLS1 of the same AGN luminosity. The above
result seems to hold over the entire range of distance and luminosity. Moreover
the star formation rate is higher in low black hole mass and high L/L_Edd
systems indicating that black hole growth and star formation are occurring
simultaneously.

bandgap cavities composed of dielectric rods arranged according to various
representative periodic and aperiodic lattices, with special emphasis on
possible applications to particle acceleration (along the longitudinal axis).
In this paper, we present a new study aimed at highlighting the possible
advantages of using hybrid structures based on the above dielectric
configurations, but featuring metallic rods in the outermost regions, for the
design of extremely-high quality factor, bandgap-based, accelerating
resonators. In this framework, we consider diverse configurations, with
different (periodic and aperiodic) lattice geometries, sizes, and
dielectric/metal fractions. Moreover, we also explore possible improvements
attainable via the use of superconducting plates to confine the electromagnetic
field in the longitudinal direction. Results from our comparative studies,
based on numerical full-wave simulations backed by experimental validations (at
room and cryogenic temperatures) in the microwave region, identify the
candidate parametric configurations capable of yielding the highest quality
factor.

stability diagram for triple quantum dots. The stability diagram maps out the
favored charge configuration of the system as a function of potential shifts
due to gate voltages. For triple dots only a three dimensional visualization
allows for the complete identification of all its components. Those are most
notably the so called quadruple points where four electronic configurations are
degenerate, and quantum cellular automata (QCA) processes. The exact positions
of these features within the stability diagram are now revealed. Furthermore
the influence on transport is studied by comparing the model with a two path
triple quantum dot made with local anodic oxidation. The two path setup allows
to study the influence of the dots arrangement.

almost flat background; we assumed spherical symmetry and the size of the
bubble is smaller than the size of the background horizon. According to the
thin shell approximation and the null energy condition, if the bubble is
outside of a Schwarzschild black hole, unless we assume Farhi-Guth-Guven
tunneling, expanding and inflating solutions are impossible. In this paper, we
extend our method to beyond the thin shell approximation: we include the
dynamics of fields and assume that the transition layer between a true vacuum
and a false vacuum has non-zero thickness. If a shell has sufficiently low
energy, as expected from the thin shell approximation, it collapses (Type 1).
However, if the shell has sufficiently large energy, it tends to expand. Here,
via the field dynamics, field values of inside of the shell slowly roll down to
the true vacuum and hence the shell does not inflate (Type 2). If we add
sufficient exotic matters to regularize the curvature near the shell, inflation
may be possible without assuming Farhi-Guth-Guven tunneling. In this case, a
wormhole is dynamically generated around the shell (Type 3). By tuning our
simulation parameters, we could find transitions between Type 1 and Type 2, as
well as between Type 2 and Type 3. Between Type 2 and Type 3, we could find
another class of solutions (Type 4). Finally, we discuss the generation of a
bubble universe and the violation of unitarity. We conclude that the existence
of a certain combination of exotic matter fields violates unitarity.
