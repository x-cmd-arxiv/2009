reverberation mapping campaign, undertaken primarily at MDM Observatory with

Hbeta emission region within the broad line regions (BLRs) of several nearby
AGNs exhibit a variety of kinematic behaviors. While the primary goal of this

measurements for several relatively low luminosity AGNs (presented in a
separate work), we were also able to unambiguously reconstruct
velocity-resolved reverberation signals from a subset of our targets. Through
high cadence spectroscopic monitoring of the optical continuum and broad Hbeta
emission line variations observed in the nuclear regions of NGC 3227, NGC 3516,
and NGC 5548, we clearly see evidence for outflowing, infalling, and virialized
BLR gas motions, respectively.

superfield can give a perfect explanation for both the relic density and the
Pamela result through the Sommerfeld-enhanced annihilation into singlet Higgs
bosons ($a$ or $h$ followed by $h->a a$) with $a$ being light enough to decay
dominantly to muons or electrons. In this work we analyze the parameter space
required by such a dark matter explanation and also consider the constraints
from the LEP experiments. We find that although the light singlet Higgs bosons
have small mixings with the Higgs doublets in the allowed parameter space,
their couplings with the SM-like Higgs boson $h_{SM}$ (the lightest
doublet-dominant Higgs boson) can be enhanced by the soft parameter $A_\kappa$
and, in order to meet the stringent LEP constraints, the $h_{SM}$ tends to
decay into the singlet Higgs pairs $aa$ or $hh$ instead of $b\bar b$. So the
$h_{SM}$ produced at the LHC will give a multi-muon signal, h_{SM} -> aa -> 4
muons or h_{SM} -> hh -> 4 a -> 8 muons.

eruptions occurred in close succession in time, and that all of them were
located along an S-shaped magnetic polarity inversion line (PIL) of the active
region. In our analysis, (1) the disturbance created by the first flare
propagated southward along the PIL to cause a major filament eruption that led
to the first CME and the associated second flare underneath. (2) The first CME
partially removed the overlying magnetic fields over the northern Delta spot to
allow the third flare and the second CME. (3) The ribbon separation during the
fourth flare would indicate reclosing of the overlying field lines opened by
the second CME. It is thus concluded that this series of flares and CMEs are
interrelated to each other via magnetic reconnections between the expanding
magnetic structure and the nearby magnetic fields. These results complement
previous works made on this event with the suggested causal relationship among
the successive eruptions.

partons in different elements of phase space. In this work we address this
question and suggest a method to describe effectively the fluctuations in the
instantaneous configuration of a colliding hadron. This problem is intimately
related to the origin of the inelastic diffractive processes. We present a new

investigate the crucial role of a defect-core in the energetics of vacancies in
aluminum. We find that vacancy core-energy is significantly influenced by the
state of deformation at the vacancy-core, especially volumetric strains.
Insights from the core electronic structure and computed displacement fields
show that this dependence on volumetric strains is closely related to the
changing nature of the core-structure under volumetric deformations. These
results are in sharp contrast to mechanics descriptions based on elastic
interactions that often consider defect core-energies as an inconsequential
constant. Calculations suggest that the variation in core-energies with
changing macroscopic deformations is quantitatively more significant than the
corresponding variation in relaxation energies associated with elastic fields.
Upon studying the influence of various macroscopic deformations, which include
volumetric, uniaxial, biaxial and shear deformations, on the formation energies
of vacancies, we show that volumetric deformations play a dominant role in
governing the energetics of these defects. Further, by plotting formation
energies of vacancies and di-vacancies against the volumetric strain
corresponding to any macroscopic deformation, we find that all variations in
the formation energies collapse on to a universal curve. This suggests a
universal role of volumetric strains in the energetics of vacancies.
Implications of these results in the context of dynamic failure in metals due
to spalling are analyzed.

clustering out to 10 times the virial radius of the groups and so redefine
their properties according to the spatial patterns in the fields and relate
them to galaxy evolution. Group members and interlopers were redefined after
the identification of gaps in the redshift distribution. We then used
exploratory spatial statistics based on the second moment of the Ripley
function to probe the anisotropy in the galaxy distribution around the groups.
We found an important anticorrelation between anisotropy and the fraction of
early-type galaxies in these fields. Our results illustrate how the dynamical
state of galaxy groups can be ascertained by the systematic study of their
neighborhoods.This is an important achievement, since the correct estimate of
the extent to which galaxies are affected by the group environment and follow
large-scale filamentary structure is relevant to understanding the process of
galaxy clustering and evolution in the Universe.

Omega_DE is most sensitive to the normalization and its redshift evolution

argue that it is the strongest candidate yet for a bulge planet. Deviations
from the single-lens fit are smoothed out by finite-source effects and so are
not immediately apparent from the light curve. Nevertheless, we find that a
model in which the primary has a planetary companion is favored over the
single-lens model by \Delta\chi^2 ~ 880 for an additional three degrees of
freedom. Detailed analysis yields a planet/star mass ratio
q=(3.3+/-0.3)x10^{-4} and an angular separation between the planet and star
within 10% of the angular Einstein radius. The small angular Einstein radius,
\theta_E=0.155+/-0.011 mas, constrains the distance to the lens to be D_L>6.0
kpc if it is a star (M_L>0.08 M_sun). This is the only microlensing exoplanet
host discovered so far that must be in the bulge if it is a star. By analyzing
VLT NACO adaptive optics images taken near the baseline of the event, we detect
additional blended light that is aligned to within 130 mas of the lensed
source. This light is plausibly from the lens, but could also be due to a
companion to lens or source, or possibly an unassociated star. If the blended
light is indeed due to the lens, we can estimate the mass of the lens,
M_L=0.67+/-0.14 M_sun, planet mass m=74+/-17 M_Earth, and projected separation
between the planet and host, 1.25+/-0.10 AU, putting it right on the ""snow
line"". If not, then the planet has lower mass, is closer to its host and is
colder. To distinguish among these possibilities on reasonable timescales would
require obtaining Hubble Space Telescope images almost immediately, before the
source-lens relative motion of \mu=5 mas yr^{-1} causes them to separate
substantially.

neutron star(NS)-NS and black hole-NS mergers, and the resulting implications
for short-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Though dynamically important, the
energy released during the r-process is not yet taken into account in merger
simulations. We use a nuclear reaction network to calculate the heating (due to
beta-decays and nuclear fission) experienced by material on the
marginally-bound orbits nominally responsible for late-time fall-back. Since
matter with longer orbital periods t_orb experiences lower densities, for
longer periods of time, the total r-process heating rises rapidly with t_orb,
such that material with t_orb > 1 seconds can become completely unbound. Thus,
r-process heating fundamentally changes the canonical prediction of an
uninterrupted power-law decline in the fall-back rate dM/dt at late times. When
the timescale for r-process to complete is > 1 second, the heating produces a
complete cut-off in fall-back accretion after ~ 1 second; if robust, this would
imply that fall-back accretion cannot explain the late-time X-ray flaring
observed following some short GRBs. However, for a narrow, but physically
plausible, range of parameters, fall-back accretion can resume after ~ 10 s,
despite having been strongly suppressed for ~ 1-10 s after the merger. This
suggests the intriguing possibility that the gap observed between the prompt
and extended emission in short GRBs is a manifestation of r-process heating.

variation of the neutrino masses on cosmological time scales. In this work we
propose a parameterization for the neutrino mass variation that captures the
essentials of those scenarios and allows to constrain them in a model
independent way, that is, without resorting to any particular scalar field
model. Using WMAP 5yr data combined with the matter power spectrum of SDSS and
2dFGRS, the limit on the present value of the neutrino mass is $m_0 \equiv
m_{\nu}(z=0) < 0.43 (0.28)$ eV at 95% C.L. for the case in which the neutrino
mass was lighter (heavier) in the past, a result competitive with the ones
imposed for standard (i.e., constant mass) neutrinos. Moreover, for the ratio
of the mass variation of the neutrino mass $\Delta m_{\nu}$ over the current
mass $m_0$ we found that $\log[|\Delta m_{\nu}|/m_0] < -1.3 (-2.7)$ at 95% C.L.
for $\Delta m_{\nu} < 0 (\Delta m_{\nu} > 0)$, totally consistent with no mass
variation. These stringent bounds on the mass variation are not related to the
neutrino free-streaming history which may affect the matter power spectrum on
small scales. On the contrary, they are imposed by the fact that any
significant transfer of energy between the neutrino and dark energy components
would lead to an instability contradicting CMB and large scale structure data
on the largest observable scales.

SN light curves in the near infrared using recent data from PAIRITEL and the
literature. We construct a hierarchical Bayesian framework, incorporating
several uncertainties including photometric error, peculiar velocities, dust
extinction and intrinsic variations, for coherent statistical inference. SN Ia
light curve inferences are drawn from the global posterior probability of
parameters describing both individual supernovae and the population conditioned
on the entire SN Ia NIR dataset. The logical structure of the hierarchical
model is represented by a directed acyclic graph. Fully Bayesian analysis of
the model and data is enabled by an efficient MCMC algorithm exploiting the
conditional structure using Gibbs sampling. We apply this framework to the
JHK_s SN Ia light curve data. A new light curve model captures the observed
J-band light curve shape variations. The intrinsic variances in peak absolute
magnitudes are: sigma(M_J) = 0.17 +/- 0.03, sigma(M_H) = 0.11 +/- 0.03, and
sigma(M_Ks) = 0.19 +/- 0.04. We describe the first quantitative evidence for
correlations between the NIR absolute magnitudes and J-band light curve shapes,
and demonstrate their utility for distance estimation. The average residual in
the Hubble diagram for the training set SN at cz > 2000 km/s is 0.10 mag. The
new application of bootstrap cross-validation to SN Ia light curve inference
tests the sensitivity of the model fit to the finite sample and estimates the
prediction error at 0.15 mag. These results demonstrate that SN Ia NIR light
curves are as effective as optical light curves, and, because they are less
vulnerable to dust absorption, they have great potential as precise and
accurate cosmological distance indicators.

maximum light to day +786 is presented. The data are combined with published
nebular-phase infrared spectra, and the observations are compared to model
light curves and synthetic nebular spectra. SN 2003hv is a normal Type Ia
supernova (SN Ia) with photometric and spectroscopic properties consistent with
its rarely observed B-band decline-rate parameter, Delta m_15 = 1.61 +- 0.02.
The blueshift of the most isolated [Fe II] lines in the nebular-phase optical
spectrum appears consistent with those observed in the infrared at similar
epochs. At late times there is a prevalent color evolution from the optical
toward the near-infrared bands. We present the latest-ever detection of a SN Ia
in the near-infrared in Hubble Space Telescope images. The study of the
ultraviolet/optical/infrared (UVOIR) light curve reveals that a substantial
fraction of the flux is ""missing"" at late times. Between 300-700 days past
maximum brightness, the UVOIR light curve declines linearly following the decay
of radioactive Co56, assuming full and instantaneous positron trapping. At 700
days we detect a possible slowdown of the decline in optical bands, mainly in
the V band. The data are incompatible with a dramatic infrared catastrophe.
However, the idea that an infrared catastrophe occurred in the densest regions
before 350 days can explain the missing flux from the UVOIR wavelengths and the
flat-topped profiles in the near-infrared. We argue that such a scenario is
possible if the ejecta are clumpy. The observations suggest that positrons are
most likely trapped in the ejecta.

galaxies have been studied in great detail using high resolution X-ray
absorption spectra. A recurring feature of these outflows is their broad
ionization distribution including essentially ions (e.g., of Fe) from neutral
to fully ionized. The absorption measure distribution (AMD) is defined as the
distribution of column density with ionization parameter |d N_H/d (log xi)|.
AMDs of Seyfert outflows can span up to five orders of magnitude in xi. We
present the AMD of five outflows and show that they are all rather flat,
perhaps slightly rising towards high ionization. More quantitatively, a
power-law fit for log AMD ~ (log xi)^a yields slopes of 0 < a < 0.4. These
slopes tightly constrain the density profiles of the wind, which until now
could be addressed only by theory. If the wind is distributed on large scales,
the measured slopes imply a generic density radial profile of n ~ r^{-alpha}
with 1 < alpha < 1.3. This scaling rules out a mass conserving radial flow of n
~ r^{-2}, or a constant density absorber, but is consistent with a
non-spherical MHD outflow model in which n ~ r^{-1} along any given line of
sight. On the other hand, if ionization variations are a result of local (delta
r) density gradients, e.g. as in the turbulent interstellar medium (ISM), the
AMD slopes imply density scaling of n ~ delta r^{-alpha} with 0.7 < alpha <
1.0, which is quite different from the scaling of approximately n ~ delta
r^{0.4} found in the Milky Way ISM and typical of incompressible turbulence.

primary purpose of these simulations is to test the data reduction pipeline for

frequency coverage beyond the ACT bands to make these simulations applicable to
other microwave background experiments. Some of the novel features of these
simulations are that the radio and infrared galaxy populations are correlated
with the galaxy cluster populations, the CMB is lensed by the dark matter
structure in the simulation via a ray-tracing code, the contribution to the
thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) signals from galaxy clusters,
groups, and the IGM has been included, and the gas prescription to model the SZ
signals matches the most recent X-ray observations. Regarding the contamination
of cluster SZ flux by radio galaxies, we find for 148 GHz (90 GHz) only 3% (4%)
of halos have their SZ decrements contaminated at a level of 20% or more. We
find the contamination levels higher for infrared galaxies. However, at 90 GHz,
less than 20% of clusters with M_{200} > 2.5 x 10^{14} Msun and z<1.2 have
their SZ decrements filled in at a level of 20% or more. At 148 GHz, less than
20% of clusters with M_{200} > 2.5 x 10^{14} Msun and z<0.8 have their SZ
decrements filled in at a level of 50% or larger. Our models also suggest that
a population of very high flux infrared galaxies, which are likely lensed
sources, contribute most to the SZ contamination of very massive clusters at 90
and 148 GHz. These simulations are publicly available and should serve as a
useful tool for microwave surveys to cross-check SZ cluster detection, power
spectrum, and cross-correlation analyses.

the existence of these NPCs. By exploiting the theory of continuous-time,
reversible Markov diffusion processes, we give a different interpretation of
these NPCs and the smoothness constraints. When the diffusion matrix is used to
enforce smoothness, the NPCs maximize long-run variation relative to the
overall variation subject to orthogonality constraints. Moreover, the NPCs
behave as scalar autoregressions with heteroskedastic innovations; this
supports semiparametric identification and estimation of a multivariate
reversible diffusion process and tests of the overidentifying restrictions
implied by such a process from low frequency data. We also explore implications
for stationary, possibly non-reversible diffusion processes. Finally, we
suggest a sieve method to estimate the NPCs from discretely-sampled data.

maximize the number of sources extracted. Observations at other wavelengths
were used to identify low count-rate sources and remove likely spurious
sources. Monte Carlo simulations were also used to assess the authenticity of
these sources. We used a Bayesian technique to identify optical or near-IR
counterparts for 1501 (89%) of our sources, using deep observations from the

Infrared Deep Sky Survey-Galactic plane Survey. 755 (45%) of these objects have
six-band r', H-alpha, i', J, H, and K optical and near-IR photometry. From an
analysis of the Poisson false-source probabilities for each source we estimate
that our X-ray catalogue includes < 1% of false sources, and an even lower
fraction when only sources with optical or near-IR associations are considered.
A Monte Carlo simulation of the Bayesian matching scheme allows this method to
be compared to more simplified matching techniques and enables the various

pacemaker, trying to impose its rhythm on the overall spatiotemporal evolution
of the three species. We show that the pacemaker is able to nucleate target
waves that eventually spread across the whole population, whereby three routes
leading to this phenomenon can be distinguished depending on the mobility of
the three species and the oscillation period of the localized current. First,
target waves can emerge due to the synchronization between the periodic current
and oscillations of the density of the three species on the spatial grid. The
second route is similar to the first, the difference being that the
synchronization sets in only intermittently. Finally, the third route towards
target waves is realized when the frequency of the pacemaker is much higher
than that characterizing the oscillations of the overall density of the three
species. By considering mobility and the frequency of the current as variable
parameters, we thus provide insights into the mechanisms of pattern formation

The NMR spectra are consistent with incommensurate antiferromagnetic order of

depend critically on the direction of the ordered moments, the ordering
wavevector and the symmetry of the hyperfine coupling to the Ce spins. Assuming
isotropic hyperfine coupling, the NMR spectra observed for H||[100] are
consistent with magnetic order with wavevector Q=pi((1+delta)/a,1/a,1/c) and Ce
moments ordered antiferromagnetically along the [100] direction in real space.
If the hyperfine coupling has dipolar symmetry, then the NMR spectra require Ce
moments along the [001] direction. The dipolar scenario is also consistent with
recent neutron scattering measurements that find an ordered moment of 0.15 mu_B
along [001] and Q_n=pi((1+delta)/a,(1+delta)/a,1/c) with incommensuration delta

streaming l_fs scale and a inner galaxy core radius r_core, both quantities
determined in terms of a single parameter E_c, which corresponds to the phase
transition energy scale of the subjacent elementary particle model. For
energies above E_c or for a scale factor a smaller then a_c, with a<a_c<a_{eq},
the particles are massless and rho redshifts as radiation. However, once the

efficient algorithm based on the idea of \emph{core sets} exists (Core Vector

However CVM works in batch mode requiring multiple passes over the data. This
paper presents a single-pass SVM which is based on the minimum enclosing ball
of streaming data. We show that the MEB updates for the streaming case can be
easily adapted to learn the SVM weight vector in a way similar to using online
stochastic gradient updates. Our algorithm performs polylogarithmic computation

field evolution in an equatorial coronal hole region. Two dipoles emerge one by
one. The negative element of the first dipole disappears due to the interaction
with the positive element of the second dipole. During this process, a jet and
a plasma eruption are observed. The opposite polarities of the second dipole
separate at first, and then cancel with each other, which is first reported in
a coronal hole. With the reduction of unsigned magnetic flux of the second
dipole from 9.8*10^20 Mx to 3.0*10^20 Mx in two days, 171 A brightness
decreases by 75% and coronal loops shrink obviously. At the cancellation sites,
the transverse fields are strong and point directly from the positive elements
to the negative ones, meanwhile Doppler red-shifts with an average velocity of
0.9 km s-1 are observed, comparable to the horizontal velocity (1.0 km s-1)
derived from the cancelling island motion. Several days later, the northeastern
part of the coronal hole, where the dipoles are located, appears as a quiet
region. These observations support the idea that the interaction between the
two dipoles is caused by flux reconnection, while the cancellation between the
opposite polarities of the second dipole is due to the submergence of original
loops. These results will help us to understand coronal hole evolution.

neutron-star (BNS) system in quasi-equilibrium circular orbit. Two formulations
for non-conformally flat data, waveless (WL) and near-zone helically symmetric
(NHS), are introduced; in each formulation, the Einstein-Euler system, written
in 3+1 form on an asymptotically flat spacelike hypersurface, is exactly solved
for all metric components, including the spatially non-conformally flat
potentials, and for irrotational flow. A numerical method applicable to both
formulations is explained with an emphasis on the imposition of a spatial gauge
condition. Results are shown for solution sequences of irrotational BNS with
matter approximated by parametrized equations of state that use a few segments
of polytropic equations of state. The binding energy and total angular momentum
of solution sequences computed within the conformally flat --
Isenberg-Wilson-Mathews (IWM) -- formulation are closer to those of the third
post-Newtonian (3PN) two point particles up to the closest orbits, for the more
compact stars, whereas sequences resulting from the WL/NHS formulations deviate
from the 3PN curve even more for the sequences with larger compactness. We
think it likely that this correction reflects an overestimation in the IWM
formulation as well as in the 3PN formula, by $\sim 1$ cycle in the
gravitational wave phase during the last several orbits. The work suggests that
imposing spatial conformal flatness results in an underestimate of the
quadrupole deformation of the components of binary neutron-star systems in the
last few orbits prior to merger.

traffic over wireless channels. We extend prior work, which characterizes a
real-time flow by its traffic pattern, delay bound, timely-throughput
requirement, and channel reliability, to allow time-varying channels, allow
clients to have different deadlines, and allow for the optional employment of
rate adaptation. Thus, our model allow the treatment of more realistic fading
channels as well as scenarios with mobile nodes, and the usage of more general
transmission strategies.
  We derive a sufficient condition for a scheduling policy to be feasibility
optimal, and thereby establish a class of feasibility optimal policies. We
demonstrate the utility of the identified class by deriving a feasibility
optimal policy for the scenario with rate adaptation, time-varying channels,
and heterogeneous delay bounds. When rate adaptation is not available, we also
derive a feasibility optimal policy for time-varying channels. For the scenario
where rate adaptation is not available but clients have different delay bounds,
we describe a heuristic. Simulation results are also presented which indicate
the usefulness of the scheduling policies for more realistic and complex
scenarios.

However, network
edges are considered to be the same in almost all these studies. In this paper,
we present a simple classification method, which divides the edges of
undirected, unweighted networks into two types: p2c and p2p. The p2c edge
represents a hierarchical relationship between two nodes, while the p2p edge
represents an equal relationship between two nodes. It is surprising and
unexpected that for many real-world networks from a wide variety of domains
(including computer science, transportation, biology, engineering and social
science etc), the p2c degree distribution follows a power law more strictly
than the total degree distribution, while the p2p degree distribution follows
the Weibull distribution very well. Thus, the total degree distribution can be
seen as a mixture of power-law and Weibull distributions. More surprisingly, it
is found that in many cases, the total degree distribution can be better
described by the Weibull distribution, rather than a power law as previously
suggested. By comparing two topology models, we think that the origin of the
Weibull distribution in complex networks might be a mixture of both
preferential and random attachments when networks evolve.

antiferromagnetic coupling favors the local spin-singlet and suppresses the
Kondo screening. The effective Kondo temperature T_k (proptotional to the

between the Kondo screened phase for K < K_c and the local spin-singlet phase

entanglements between the nearest neighbor are equal, independent of the
temperatures of the two baths. The maximum of the entanglement arrives at
$T_L=T_R$. For nonsymmetric qubit-qubit couplings, however, the situation is
totally different. The baths at different temperatures would benefit the
entanglement and the entanglements between the nearest neighbors are no longer
equal. By examining the probability distribution of each eigenstate in the
steady state, we present an explanation for these observations. These results
suggest that the steady entanglement can be controlled by the temperature of

simulations ccurately predict the number of cosmic strings in the universe,
this non-detection allows us to place upper limits on the unitless Universal
cosmic string tension of G mu/c^2 < 2.3 x 10^-6, and cosmic string density of
Omega_s < 2.1 x 10^-5 at the 95% confidence level (marginalising over the other

single filter guest observer images (1.08 square degrees), which we are unable
to conclusively eliminate with existing data. The confirmation of any one of
these candidates as cosmic strings would imply G mu/c^2 ~ 10^-6 and Omega_s ~
10^-5. However, we estimate that there is at least a 92% chance that these
string candidates are random alignments of galaxies. If we assume that these
candidates are indeed false detections, our final limits on G mu/c^2 and
Omega_s fall to 6.5 x 10^-7 and 7.3 x 10^-6. Due to the extensive sky coverage
of the HST/ACS image archive, the above limits are universal. They are quite
sensitive to the number of fields being searched, and could be further reduced

scale, while the most energy containing scale is $\sim L_0/5$. The peak scale
of spectrum of projected, two-dimensional field is $\sim L_0$. (2) During the

power-law increase of $\sim t^{1.5}$, while the integral and curvature scales
show a linear increase. The equipartition, integral, and curvature scales
saturate at $\sim L_0$, $\sim 0.3L_0$, and $\sim 0.15L_0$, respectively. (3)

silicon carbide was successfully found to superconduct by means of resistivity
and DC magnetization measurements. In contrast to boron-doped silicon carbide,
the aluminum doped system is treated as a type-II superconductor because of the
absence of an hysteresis in data measured upon decreasing and increasing
temperature in finite magnetic fields. In this paper, results of a recent AC

One may therefore ask if renormalization becomes simpler if one resolves this
arrangement to a normal crossing divisor. In this paper we study the extension
problem of distributions onto the wonderful models of de Concini and Procesi,
which generalize the Fulton-MacPherson compactification of configuration
spaces. We show that a canonical extension onto the smooth model coincides with
the usual Epstein-Glaser renormalization. To this end we use an analytic
regularization for position space. The 't Hooft identities relating the pole
coefficients may be recovered from the stratification, and Zimmermann's forest
formula is encoded in the geometry of the compactification. Consequently one
subtraction along each irreducible component of the divisor suffices to get a
finite result using local counterterms. As a corollary, we identify the Hopf

the case of higher degree of divergence.

proposed. It suggests the use of the modified Gaussian-type initial conditions
for the energy density in the transverse plane. Finally, the processes of the

incorporated in the model. The inclusion of the free-streaming stage allows for
the delayed start of the hydrodynamic evolution, which is a desirable effect in

the solubility of those elements is rather low, formation of secondary phases
and the creation of defects upon low temperature processing can lead to
unwanted magnetic effects. Among others, ion implantation is a method of
doping, which is highly suited for the investigation of those effects. By
focussing mainly on Fe, Co or Ni implanted ZnO single crystals we show that
there are manifold sources for ferromagnetism in this material which can easily

pharmacological and toxicological properties in small molecules by comparing

method for connectivity mapping with increased specificity and sensitivity was
recently developed, and its utility demonstrated using experimentally derived
gene signatures.
  Results: This paper introduces sscMap (statistically significant connections'
map), a Java application designed to undertake connectivity mapping tasks using
the recently published method. The software is bundled with a default
collection of reference gene-expression profiles based on the publicly
available dataset from the Broad Institute Connectivity Map 02, which includes
data from over 7000 Affymetrix microarrays, for over 1000 small-molecule
compounds, and 6100 treatment instances in 5 human cell lines. In addition, the
application allows users to add their custom collections of reference profiles
and is applicable to a wide range of other 'omics technologies.
  Conclusions: The utility of sscMap is two fold. First, it serves to make
statistically significant connections between a user-supplied gene signature
and the 6100 core reference profiles based on the Broad Institute expanded
dataset. Second, it allows users to apply the same improved method to
custom-built reference profiles which can be added to the database for future

origin is mass accretion episodes of fall-back matter on a newly born compact
object. The prompt emission pulses are produced by a bipolar jet of highly
relativistic plasmoids (CBs) ejected in the early, major episodes of mass
accretion. As the accretion material is consumed, one may expect the engine's
activity to weaken. X-ray flares ending the prompt emission and during the
afterglow phase are produced in such delayed episodes of mass accretion. The
common engine, environment and radiation mechanisms (inverse Compton scattering
and synchrotron radiation) produce their observed similarities. Flares in both
long GRBs and short hard gamma ray bursts (SHBs) can also be produced by
bipolar ejections of CBs following a phase transition in compact objects due to
loss of angular momentum and/or cooling. Optical flares, however, are mostly
produced in collisions of CBs with massive stellar winds/ejecta or with density
bumps along their path. In this paper we show that the master formulae of the

blazars, radio quasars or radio galaxies. At present, 15 objects still remain
without identification due to the lack of optical spectroscopic data or a clear
radio counterpart. Our results allow us to define a flux limited sample of 203
high Galactic latitude microwave sources ($f_{41GHz} \ge 1$ Jy, $|b_{\rm II}| >
15^\circ$) which is virtually completely identified (99%). The microwave band
is ideally suited for blazar statistical studies since this is the part of the
em spectrum that is least affected by the superposition of spectral components
of different origin. Using this data-set we derived number counts, luminosity
functions and cosmological evolution of blazars and radio galaxies at microwave
frequencies. Our results are in good agreement with those found at radio
frequencies. The 5 GHz bivariate blazar luminosity functions are similar to
those derived from the DXRBS survey, which shows that this sample is
representative of the blazar population at 41 GHz. Microwave selected broad-
lined quasars are about 6 times more abundant than BL Lacs, a ratio that is
similar to, or larger than, that seen at radio and gamma-ray frequencies, once
spectral selection effects are taken into account. This strongly suggests that
the mechanism responsible for the generation of gamma-rays is, at first order,
the same in all blazar types. Our results confirm the findings of Giommi &
Colafrancesco (2004, 2006) that blazars and radio galaxies are the largest
contaminants of the CMB anisotropy maps. We predict that these sources are also
bright gamma-ray sources, most of which will be detected by AGILE and FERMI.

showed quasi-periodic oscillations in hard X-rays and their loop-top sources

to explain the observed HXR oscillations. We interpret these HXR oscillations
as being due to oscillations of magnetic traps within cusp-like magnetic
structures. This is confirmed by a good correlation between periods of the
oscillations and the sizes of the loop-top sources. We argue that a model of
oscillating magnetic traps is adequate to explain the observations. During the
compressions of a trap particles are accelerated, but during its expansions
plasma, coming from chromospheric evaporation, fills the trap, which explains
the large number of electrons being accelerated during a sequence of strong
impulses. The advantage of our model of oscillating magnetic traps is that it
can explain both the impulses of electron acceleration and quasi-periodicity of
their distribution in time.

distinction between a single object -- that can be intrinsically asymmetric --
and a collection of objects -- whose racemic state is the more stable one --
must be emphasized. A system of strongly interacting objects can be described
as one single object retaining its individuality and a single asymmetry; weakly
or non-interacting objects keep their own individuality, and are prone to
racemize towards the equilibrium state. In the presence of energy fluxes,
systems can be maintained in an asymmetric non-equilibrium steady-state. Such

introduced recently by Vaswani et al., i.e. the recovery of sparse signals from
a certain number of linear measurements when the signal support is partially
known. The reconstruction method is based on a convex minimization program
coined ""innovative Basis Pursuit DeNoise"" (or iBPDN). Under the common
$\ell_2$-fidelity constraint made on the available measurements, this
optimization promotes the ($\ell_1$) sparsity of the candidate signal over the
complement of this known part. In particular, this paper extends the results of
Vaswani et al. to the cases of compressible signals and noisy measurements. Our
proof relies on a small adaption of the results of Candes in 2008 for
characterizing the stability of the Basis Pursuit DeNoise (BPDN) program. We
emphasize also an interesting link between our method and the recent work of
Davenport et al. on the $\delta$-stable embeddings and the
""cancel-then-recover"" strategy applied to our problem. For both approaches,
reconstructions are indeed stabilized when the sensing matrix respects the
Restricted Isometry Property for the same sparsity order. We conclude by
sketching an easy numerical method relying on monotone operator splitting and
proximal methods that iteratively solves iBPDN.

access the Internet through network points of attachment (PoA) based on
heterogeneous wireless technologies. They also wish to seamlessly change the
PoAs during their ongoing sessions to improve service quality and/or reduce
monetary cost. If appropriately handled, multihomed mobile nodes offer a
potential solution to this issue. In this sense, the management of multihomed
mobile nodes in heterogeneous environment is a key research topic. In this
paper, we present an improvement of SIP mobility (pre-call plus mid-call
mobility) to support seamless mobility of multihomed mobile nodes in
heterogeneous wireless networks. Pre-call mobility is extended to associate
user identifier (i.e. SIP URI) and interface identifiers (i.e. IP addresses).
The multiple addresses of a mobile device are weighted by the user to create a
priority list in the SIP server so as to guarantee resilient reachability of
mobile nodes and to avoid unnecessary signaling through wireless links, thus
saving radio resources. Then, three variations of mid-call mobility, called
hard, hybrid and soft procedures, are also proposed. Their main aim is to
minimize, or even avoid, packet losses during interface switching at the mobile
node. The proposed solutions have been implemented in a wireless heterogeneous
testbed composed of 802.11 WLAN plus 3.5 cellular network, which are fully
controlled and configurable. The testbed has been used to study the performance
and the robustness of the three proposed mid-call mobility procedures.

measure in $S^*_x M$. We strengthen this result here by showing that such a
manifold must have a point where the set ${\mathcal R}_x$ of recurrent
directions for the geodesic flow through x satisfies $|{\mathcal R}_x|>0$. We
also show that if there are no such points, $L^2$-normalized quasimodes have
sup-norms that are $o(\lambda^{n-1)/2})$, and, in the other extreme, we show
that if there is a point blow-down $x$ at which the first return map for the
flow is the identity, then there is a sequence of quasi-modes with
$L^\infty$-norms that are $\Omega(\lambda^{(n-1)/2})$.

components produced by phenomena of different types is considered. The required
measurements should be capable of cancelling out those signal components which
are to be ignored when focusing on a phenomenon of interest. Under the
hypothesis that the subspaces hosting the signal components produced by each
phenomenon are complementary, their discrimination is accomplished by
measurements giving rise to the appropriate oblique projector operator. The
subspace onto which the operator should project is selected by nonlinear
techniques in line with adaptive pursuit strategies.

each given partition, dictionaries of B-spline functions for the corresponding
spline space are constructed. It is asserted that, by dividing the given
partition into subpartitions and joining together the bases for the concomitant
subspaces, slightly redundant dictionaries of B-splines functions are obtained.
Such dictionaries are proved to span the spline space associated to the given
partition. The proposed construction is shown to be potentially useful for the
purpose of sparse signal representation. With that goal in mind, spline spaces
specially adapted to produce a sparse representation of a given signal are
considered.

driving potential. By controlling the space and time symmetries of the driving
we show how a directed current can be induced, producing a coherent quantum
ratchet. Weak driving induces a regular behavior that is strongly governed by
the interparticle interaction. Breaking both space and time symmetries is
required to produce current flow. For strong driving the behavior becomes
chaotic. The resulting effective irreversibility renders the space asymmetry
sufficient to produce the ratchet effect, although the system is completely
coherent.

proposed. The resulting nonlinear technique is shown to be suitable for dealing
with cases that cannot be tackled by the linear one.

accretion rate makes it difficult to explain the LGRBs with duration in excess
of 100 seconds as well as the precursors separated from the main gamma-ray
pulse by few hundreds of seconds. Even more difficult is to explain the Swift
observations of the shallow decay phase and X-ray flares, if they indeed
indicate activity of the central engine for as long as 10,000 seconds. These
data suggest that some other, most likely magnetic mechanisms have to be
considered. The magnetic models do not require the development of accretion
disk within the first few seconds of the stellar collapse and hence do not
require very rapidly rotating stellar cores at the pre-supernova state. This
widens the range of potential LGRB progenitors. In this paper, we re-examine
the close binary scenario allowing for the possibility of late development of
accretion disks in the collapsar model and investigate the available range of
mass accretion rates, black hole masses, and spins. A particularly interesting
version of the binary progenitor involves merger of a WR star with an
ultra-compact companion, neutron star or black hole. In this case we expect the
formation of very long-lived accretion disks, that may explain the phase of
shallow decay and X-ray flares observed by Swift. Similarly long-lived magnetic
central engines are expected in the current single star models of LGRB
progenitors due to their assumed exceptionally fast rotation.
