  version of arXiv:0812.4864",,,,"math.QA math.CT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Groupoidification is a form of categorification in which vector spaces are
replaced by groupoids, and linear operators are replaced by spans of groupoids.
We introduce this idea with a detailed exposition of ""degroupoidification"": a
systematic process that turns groupoids and spans into vector spaces and linear
operators. Then we present three applications of groupoidification. The first
is to Feynman diagrams. The Hilbert space for the quantum harmonic oscillator
arises naturally from degroupoidifying the groupoid of finite sets and
bijections. This allows for a purely combinatorial interpretation of creation
and annihilation operators, their commutation relations, field operators, their
normal-ordered powers, and finally Feynman diagrams. The second application is
to Hecke algebras. We explain how to groupoidify the Hecke algebra associated
to a Dynkin diagram whenever the deformation parameter q is a prime power. We
illustrate this with the simplest nontrivial example, coming from the A2 Dynkin
diagram. In this example we show that the solution of the Yang-Baxter equation
built into the A2 Hecke algebra arises naturally from the axioms of projective
geometry applied to the projective plane over the finite field with q elements.
The third application is to Hall algebras. We explain how the standard
construction of the Hall algebra from the category of representations of a
simply-laced quiver can be seen as an example of degroupoidification. This in
turn provides a new way to categorify - or more precisely, groupoidify - the
positive part of the quantum group associated to the quiver.

be disturbed by the thousands dark matter sub-halos that are predicted to be
orbiting within the main halo. A sub-halo generally induces a localized wave in
the stream which often evolves into a ""z-fold"" as an initially trailing
innermost part rotates faster than an initially leading outermost part. The
folding, which becomes increasingly complex with time, leads to an apparent
velocity dispersion increase and thickening of the stream. We measure the
equivalent velocity dispersion around the local mean in the simulations,
finding that it rises to about 10 km/s after 5 Gyr and 20 km/s after 13 Gyr.
The currently available measurements of the velocity dispersion of halo star
streams range from as small as 2 km/s to slightly over 20 km/s. The streams
with velocity dispersions of 15-20 km/s are compatible with what sub-halo
heating would produce. A dynamical understanding of the low velocity dispersion
streams depends on the time since the progenitor's tidal disruption into a thin
stream. If the streams are nearly as old as their stars then sub-halos cannot
be present with the predicted numbers and masses. However, the dynamical age of
the streams can be significantly less than the stars. If the three lowest
velocity streams are assigned ages of 3 Gyr, they are in conflict with the
sub-halo heating. The main conclusion is that star stream heating is a powerful
and simple test for sub-halo structure.

fashion to propose a new approach to quantum gravity and unification. Our
proposed reconciliation of general relativity and quantum field theory is based
on a modification of their graphical instantiations, i.e., Regge calculus and
lattice gauge theory, respectively, which we assume are fundamental to their
continuum counterparts. Accordingly, the fundamental structure is a graphical
amalgam of space, time, and sources (in parlance of quantum field theory)
called a ""spacetimesource element."" These are fundamental elements of space,
time, and sources, not source elements in space and time. The transition
amplitude for a spacetimesource element is computed using a path integral with
discrete graphical action. The action for a spacetimesource element is
constructed from a difference matrix K and source vector J on the graph, as in
lattice gauge theory. K is constructed from graphical field gradients so that
it contains a non-trivial null space and J is then restricted to the row space
of K, so that it is divergence-free and represents a conserved exchange of
energy-momentum. This construct of K and J represents an adynamical global
constraint between sources, the spacetime metric, and the energy-momentum
content of the element, rather than a dynamical law for time-evolved entities.
We use this approach via modified Regge calculus to correct proper distance in
the Einstein-deSitter cosmology model yielding a fit of the Union2 Compilation
supernova data that matches LambdaCDM without having to invoke accelerating
expansion or dark energy. A similar modification to lattice gauge theory
results in an adynamical account of quantum interference.

over timescales of decades to centuries. Historical events provoked much
interest but had little economic impact. However, the widespread adoption of
advanced technological infrastructures over the past fifty years gives these
events the potential to disrupt those infrastructures - and thus create
profound economic and societal impact. However, like all extreme hazards, such
events are rare, so we have limited data on which to build our understanding of
the events. Many other natural hazards (e.g. flash floods) are highly
localised, so statistically significant datasets can be assembled by combining
data from independent instances of the hazard recorded over a few decades. But
we have a single instance of space weather so we would have to make
observations for many centuries in order to build a statistically significant
dataset. Instead we must exploit our knowledge of solar-terrestrial physics to
find other ways to assess these risks. We discuss three alternative approaches:
(a) use of proxy data, (b) studies of other solar systems, and (c) use of
physics-based modelling. The proxy data approach is well-established as a
technique for assessing the long-term risk from radiation storms, but does not
yet provide any means to assess the risk from severe geomagnetic storms. This
latter risk is more suited to the other approaches. We need to develop and
expand techniques to monitoring key space weather features in other solar
systems. To make progress in modelling severe space weather, we need to focus
on the physics that controls severe geomagnetic storms, e.g. how can dayside
and tail reconnection be modulated to expand the region of open flux to envelop
mid-latitudes?

We present broad design principles to engineer the geometry of the underlying
substrate so that a desired lamellar pattern can be obtained by self-assembly.
Two distinct physical effects are identified as key factors that contribute to
the interaction between the shape of the underlying surface and the resulting
lamellar morphology. The first is a local ordering field for the direction of
each individual layer which tends to minimize its curvature with respect to the
three-dimensional embedding. The second is a non-local effect controlled by the
intrinsic geometry of the surface that forces the normals to the (nearly
incompressible) layers to lie on geodesics, leading to caustic formation as in
optics. As a result, different surface morphologies with predominantly positive
or negative Gaussian curvature can act as converging or diverging lenses
respectively. By combining these ingredients, as one would with different
optical elements, complex lamellar morphologies can be obtained. This smectic
optometry enables the manipulation of lamellar configurations for the design of
novel materials.

orthorhombic TbMnO3 is studied from first principles. We compare the cases in
which the spin cycloid, which induces the electric polarization via the
spin-orbit interaction, is in either the b-c or a-b plane. We find that the
electronic contribution is negligible in the first case, but much larger, and
comparable to the lattice-mediated contribution, in the second case. However,
we how that this behavior is an artifact of the particular pattern of
octahedral rotations characterizing the structurally relaxed Pbnm crystal
structure. To do so, we explore how the electronic contribution varies for a
structural model of rigidly rotated MnO6 octahedra, and demonstrate that it can
vary over a wide range, comparable with the lattice-mediated contribution, for
both b-c and a-b spirals. We introduce a phenomenological model that is capable
of describing this behavior in terms of sums of symmetry-constrained
contributions arising from the displacements of oxygen atoms from the centers
of the Mn-Mn bonds.

on current-perpendicular-to-plane giant magnetoresistance. The alloys are
incorporated into hybrid spin valves of various types, and the spin memory
length is determined by fits of the Valet-Fert spin-transport equations to data
of magnetoresistance vs. alloy thickness. For the case of PdNi alloy, the
resulting values of the spin memory length are lsf(PdNi) = 2.8 +/- 0.5 nm and
5.4 +/- 0.6 nm, depending on whether or not the PdNi is exchange biased by an
adjacent Permalloy layer. For PdFe, the spin memory length is somewhat longer,
lsf(PdFe) = 9.6 +/- 2 nm, consistent with earlier measurements indicating lower
spin-orbit scattering in that material. Unfortunately, even the longer spin
memory length in PdFe may not be long enough to facilitate observation of
spin-triplet superconducting correlations predicted to occur in

argued that the quantum vacuum can possess momentum, that adds up to the
momentum of matter. This ``Casimir momentum'' is closely related to the Casimir
effect, in which case energy is exchanged. In previous theory it was treated
semi-classically. We present a non-relativistic quantum theory for the linear
momentum of electromagnetic zero-point fluctuations, considering an harmonic
oscillator subject to crossed, quasi-static magnetic and electric and coupled
to the quantum vacuum. We derive a contribution of the quantum vacuum to the
linear pseudo-momentum and give a new estimate for the achievable speed. Our
analysis show that the effect exists and that it is finite.

  of a multidimensional density","20 pages, 0 figures",,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present theoretical properties of the log-concave maximum likelihood
estimator of a density based on an independent and identically distributed
sample in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Our study covers both the case where the true
underlying density is log-concave, and where this model is misspecified. We
begin by showing that for a sequence of log-concave densities, convergence in
distribution implies much stronger types of convergence -- in particular, it
implies convergence in Hellinger distance and even in certain exponentially
weighted total variation norms. In our main result, we prove the existence and
uniqueness of a log-concave density that minimises the Kullback--Leibler
divergence from the true density over the class all log-concave densities, and
also show that the log-concave maximum likelihood estimator converges almost
surely in these exponentially weighted total variation norms to this minimiser.
In the case of a correctly specified model, this demonstrates a strong type of
consistency for the estimator; in a misspecified model, it shows that the
estimator converges to the log-concave density that is closest in the
Kullback--Leibler sense to the true density.
