discovery of new physics, among such interpretations inelastic dark matter
(IDM) can match the energy spectrum of DAMA very well while not contradicting
the results of other direct detection searches. In this paper we investigate
the general properties that a viable IDM candidate must have and search for
simple models that realize these properties in natural ways. We begin by
determining the regions of IDM parameter space that are allowed by direct
detection searches including DAMA, paying special attention to larger IDM
masses. We observe that an inelastic dark matter candidate with electroweak
interactions can naturally satisfy observational constraints while
simultaneously yielding the correct thermal relic abundance. We comment on
several other proposed dark matter explanations for the DAMA signal and
demonstrate that one of the proposed alternatives -- elastic scattering of dark
matter off electrons -- is strongly disfavored when the modulated and
unmodulated DAMA spectral data are taken into account. We then outline the
general essential features of IDM models in which inelastic scattering off
nuclei is mediated by the exchange of a massive gauge boson, and construct
natural models in the context of a warped extra dimension and supersymmetry.

and density, have emerged as emulators of nontrivial theoretical models that
are directly relevant for strongly correlated materials. However, so far the
finite temperature phase diagram has not been mapped out for any strongly
correlated quantum model. We propose a remarkable method for obtaining such a
phase diagram for the first time directly from experiments using only the
density profile in the trap as the input. We illustrate the procedure
explicitly for the Bose Hubbard model, a textbook example of a quantum phase
transition from a superfluid to a Mott insulator. Using ""exact"" quantum Monte
Carlo simulations in a trap with up to $10^6$ bosons, we show that kinks in the
local compressibility, arising from critical fluctuations, demarcate the
boundaries between superfluid and normal phases in the trap. The temperature of
the bosons in the optical lattice is determined from the density profile at the
edge. Our method can be applied to other phase transitions even when reliable
numerical results are not available.

present relativistic line models in XSPEC - LAOR and KYRLINE. The LAOR model
has the spin value set to the extremal value a=0.9982, while the KYRLINE model
enables direct fitting of the spin parameter. The spin value is constrained
mainly by the lower boundary of the broad line, which depends on the inner
boundary of the disc emission where the gravitational redshift is maximal. The
position of the inner disc boundary is usually identified with the marginally
stable orbit which is related to the spin value. In this way the LAOR model can
be used to estimate the spin value. We investigate the consistency of the LAOR
and KYRLINE models. We find that the spin values evaluated by both models agree
within the general uncertainties when applied on the current data. However, the
results are apparently distinguishable for higher quality data, such as those
simulated for the International X-ray Observatory (IXO) mission. We find that
the LAOR model tends to overestimate the spin value and furthermore, it has
insufficient resolution which affects the correct determination of the

is observed in most Swift GRBs is the tail of the prompt emission. The most
popular model to explain the SDP is Hight Latitude Emission (HLE). Many models
for the prompt emission give rise to HLE, like the popular internal shocks (IS)
model, but some models do not, such as sporadic magnetic reconnection events.
Knowing if the SDP is consistent with HLE would thus help distinguish between
different prompt emission models. In order to test this, we model the prompt
emission (and its tail) as the sum of independent pulses (and their tails). A
single pulse is modeled as emission arising from an ultra-relativistic thin
spherical expanding shell. We obtain analytic expressions for the flux in the
IS model with a Band function spectrum. We find that in this framework the
observed spectrum is also a Band function, and naturally softens with time. The
decay of the SDP is initially dominated by the tail of the last pulse, but
other pulses can dominate later. Modeling several overlapping pulses as a
single broader pulse would overestimates the SDP flux. One should thus be
careful when testing the HLE.

D-terms on the vacuum structure of global field theories once they are coupled
to N=1 supergravity and in the context of string compactifications with moduli
stabilisation. In particular, we focus on a IIB string motivated construction
of the ISS scenario and examine the influence of one additional U(1) symmetry
on the vacuum structure. We point out that in the simplest one-Kahler modulus
compactification, the original ISS vacuum gets generically destabilised by a
runaway behaviour of the potential in the modulus direction. In more general
compactifications with several Kahler moduli, we find a novel realisation of
the LARGE volume scenario with D-term uplifting to de Sitter space and both
D-term and F-term supersymmetry breaking. The structure of soft supersymmetry
breaking terms is determined in the preferred scenario where the standard model
cycle is not stabilised non-perturbatively and found to be flavour universal.
Our scenario also provides a purely supersymmetric realisation of Kahler moduli
(blow-up and fibre) inflation, with similar observational properties as the
original proposals but without the need to include an extra (non-SUSY)
uplifting term.

magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow moving through a region where an external local
magnetic field (magnetic obstacle) is applied, and the ordinary hydrodynamic
flow around a solid obstacle. The former problem is of interest both
practically and theoretically, and the latter one is a classical problem being
well understood in ordinary hydrodynamics. The first analogy is the formation
in the MHD flow of an impenetrable region -- core of the magnetic obstacle --
as the interaction parameter $N$, i.e. strength of the applied magnetic field,
increases significantly. The core of the magnetic obstacle is streamlined both
by the upstream flow and by the induced cross stream electric currents, like a
foreign insulated insertion placed inside the ordinary hydrodynamic flow. In
the core, closed streamlines of the mass flow resemble contour lines of
electric potential, while closed streamlines of the electric current resemble
contour lines of pressure. The second analogy is the breaking away of attached
vortices from the recirculation pattern produced by the magnetic obstacle when
the Reynolds number $Re$, i.e. velocity of the upstream flow, is larger than a
critical value. This breaking away of vortices from the magnetic obstacle is
similar to that occurring past a real solid obstacle. Depending on the inlet
and/or initial conditions, the observed vortex shedding can be either symmetric
or asymmetric.

calculating a non trivial lower bound p(T) on the supremal strict p-negative
type of any given finite metric tree (T,d). In the context of finite metric
trees any such lower bound p(T) > 1 is deemed to be non trivial. In this paper
we refine the technique of enhanced negative type and show how it may be
applied more generally to any finite metric space (X,d) that is known to have
strict p-negative type for some non negative p. This allows us to significantly
improve the lower bounds on the supremal strict p-negative type of finite
metric trees that were given by Doust and Weston and, moreover, leads in to one
of our main results: The supremal p-negative type of a finite metric space
cannot be strict. By way of application we are then able to exhibit large
classes of finite metric spaces (such as finite isometric subspaces of Hadamard
manifolds) that must have strict p-negative type for some p > 1. We also show
that if a metric space (finite or otherwise) has p-negative type for some p >
0, then it must have strict q-negative type for all q in [0,p). This
generalizes a well known theorem of Schoenberg and leads to a complete
classification of the intervals on which a metric space may have strict
p-negative type. (Several of the results in this paper hold more generally for
semi-metric spaces.)

suspected to be binaries by previous studies (R144: Schnurr et al. 2008b; R145:
Moffat 1989). We have combined radial-velocity (RV) data from these two studies
with previously unpublished polarimetric data. For R145, we were able to
establish, for the first time, an orbital period of 158.8 days, along with the
full set of orbital parameters, including the inclination angle i, which was
found to be i = 38 \pm 9 deg. By applying a modified version of the
shift-and-add method developed by Demers et al. (2002), we were able to isolate
the spectral signature of the very faint-line companion star. With the RV
amplitudes of both components in R145, we were thus able to estimate their
absolute masses. We find minimum masses M_WR sin^{3}i = (116 \pm 33) M_sol and
M_O sin^{3}i = (48 \pm 20)$ M_sol for the WR and the O component, respectively.
Thus, if the low inclination angle were correct, resulting absolute masses of
the components would be at least 300 and 125 M_sol, respectively. However, such
high masses are not supported by brightness considerations when R145 is
compared to systems with known, very high masses such as NGC3603-A1 or WR20a.
An inclination angle close to 90 degrees would remedy the situation, but is
excluded by the currently available data. More and better data are thus
required to firmly establish the nature of this puzzling, yet potentially very
massive and important system. As to R144, however, the combined data sets are
not sufficient to find any periodicity.

confusion in the literature, we propose an amended, three-Hilbert-space (3HS)

as possible. We consider the problem of designing codes for this purpose, where
k bits are stored using a block of n cells with q levels each. The goal is to
maximize the number of bit writes before an erase operation is required. We
present an efficient construction of codes that can store an arbitrary number
of bits. Our construction can be viewed as an extension to multiple dimensions
of the earlier work of Jiang and Bruck, where single-dimensional codes that can
store only 2 bits were proposed.

four orders of magnitude in stellar mass, and are reasonably but not perfectly
fit by a Schechter function with characteristic stellar mass m* = 6.7 x 10^10

standard stellar Initial Mass Function, only 3.5% of the baryons in the
low-redshift Universe are locked up in stars. The projected autocorrelation
function of stellar mass is robustly and precisely determined for r_p < 30
Mpc/h. Over the range 10 kpc/kpc < r_p < 10 Mpc/h it is extremely well
represented by a power law. The corresponding three-dimensional autocorrelation
function is \xi*(r) = (r/6.1 Mpc/h)^{-1.84}. Relative to the dark matter, the
bias of the stellar mass distribution is approximately constant on large

approximately but not perfectly reproduced by current models for galaxy
formation in the concordance LCDM cosmology. Detailed comparison suggests that
a fluctuation amplitude \sigma_8 ~ 0.8 is preferred to the somewhat larger

similar to the recent events M85 OT2006-1 and SN2008S. Our high-resolution
spectra, the first for this event, are dominated by intermediate velocity
(~200-1000 km/s) hydrogen Balmer lines and CaII emission and absorption lines
that point to a complex circumstellar environment, reminiscent of the yellow
hypergiant IRC+10420. In particular, we detect broad CaII H&K absorption with
an asymmetric red wing extending to ~1000 km/s, indicative of gas infall onto a
massive and relatively compact star (blue supergiant or Wolf-Rayet star); an
extended red supergiant progenitor is unlikely. The origin of the inflowing gas
may be a previous ejection from the progenitor or the wind of a massive binary
companion. The low luminosity, intermediate velocities, and overall similarity
to a known eruptive star indicate that the event did not result in a complete
disruption of the progenitor. We identify the progenitor in archival Spitzer
observations, with deep upper limits from Hubble data. The spectral energy
distribution points to a dust-enshrouded star with a luminosity of about 6x10^4
L_sun, indicative of a ~10-20 M_sun progenitor (or binary system). This
conclusion is in good agreement with our interpretation of the outburst and
circumstellar properties. The lack of significant extinction in the transient
spectrum indicates that the dust surrounding the progenitor was cleared by the
outburst.

gas clouds that have been radiatively cooled to a few hundreds of degrees
Kelvin either via molecular or atomic (Lyman-Alpha) hydrogen lines. This
primordial mode of star formation is eventually quenched once radiative and/or
chemical (metal enrichment) feedbacks mark the transition to Population II
stars. In this paper we present a model for the formation rate of Population
III stars based on Press-Schechter modeling coupled with analytical recipes for
gas cooling and radiative feedback. Our model also includes a novel treatment
for metal pollution based on self-enrichment due to a previous episode of
Population III star formation in progenitor halos. With this model we derive
the star formation history of Population III stars, their contribution to the
re-ionization of the Universe and the time of the transition from Population
III star formation in minihalos to that in more massive halos where atomic
hydrogen cooling is also possible. We consider a grid of models highlighting
the impact of varying the values for the free parameters used, such as star
formation and feedback efficiency. The most critical factor is the assumption
that only one Population III star is formed in a halo. In this scenario, metal
free stars contribute only to a minor fraction of the total number of photons
required to re-ionize the universe. In addition, metal free star formation is
primarily located in minihalos and chemically enriched halos become the
dominant locus of star formation very early in the life of the Universe, at
redshift z~25. If instead multiple metal free stars are allowed to form out of
a single halo, then there is an overall boost of Population III star formation,
with a consequent significant contribution to the re-ionizing radiation budget.

make it difficult to distinguish between a pre- and post-main sequence
evolutionary phase on the basis of luminosity arguments. In addition, these
stars have opaque circumstellar material, obscuring the central star, so that
no detailed surface abundance studies can be performed. We propose a different
indicator for the supergiant status of a B[e] star, based on the enrichment of
its circumstellar matter by 13C, and detectable via its 13CO band emission in
the K band spectra. Based on stellar evolution models, we calculate the
variation of the 12C/13C isotopic surface abundance ratio during the evolution
of non-rotating stars with different initial masses. For different values of
the 12C/13C ratio we then compute synthetic first-overtone vibration-rotational
band spectra from both the 12CO and 13CO molecule at different spectral
resolutions. We further discuss the influence of stellar rotation on the
variation of the surface 12C/13C ratio. The surface 12C/13C isotope ratio is
found to decrease strongly during the post-main sequence evolution of
non-rotating stars, from its interstellar value of about 70 to a value of about
15-20 for stars with initial masses higher than 7 M_sun, and to a value of less
than 5 for stars with initial masses higher than 25 M_sun. We find that
detectable 13CO band head emission is produced for isotope ratios 12C/13C < 20,
and can most easily be detected with a spectral resolution of R ~ 1500...3000.
For the rotating stellar models, the drop in 12C/13C already occurs for all
stars with M > 9 M_sun during the main-sequence evolution. The detection of
13CO band head emission in such mid-resolution K band spectra of a B[e] star
thus favours an evolved rather than a young nature of the object.

structures, depend on a set of cosmological parameters, as well as, the assumed
nature of primordial perturbations. In particular, the shape of the primordial
power spectrum (PPS) is, at best, a well motivated assumption. It is known that
the assumed functional form of the PPS in cosmological parameter estimation can
affect the best fit parameters and their relative confidence limits. In this
paper, we demonstrate that a specific assumed form actually drives the best fit
parameters into distinct basins of likelihood in the space of cosmological
parameters where the likelihood resists improvement via modifications to the
PPS. The regions where considerably better likelihoods are obtained allowing
free form PPS lie outside these basins. In the absence of a preferred model of
inflation, this raises a concern that current cosmological parameters estimates
are strongly prejudiced by the assumed form of PPS. Our results strongly
motivate approaches toward simultaneous estimation of the cosmological
parameters and the shape of the primordial spectrum from upcoming cosmological
data. It is equally important for theorists to keep an open mind towards early
universe scenarios that produce features in the PPS.

the cusp anomalous dimension of Wilson loops with light-like segments. Its

we have carried out On-The-Fly mapping observations of the HCO+ (1--0) line

System. Furthermore, we observed the HCN (1--0) line with the 45m telescope,

whose deepest absorptions are seen at the peak velocity of optically thin

presence of gas infall toward the central protostar. We compared the observed
HCO+ line profiles with model ones by solving the radiative transfer in the
core under LTE assumption.We found that the core gas has a constant infall
velocity of ~0.5 km/s in the central region, leading to a mass accretion rate
of 2.5x10^{-5} Msun/yr. Consequently, we confirm that the gas infall in the

every few days. The energy spectra are well fitted by a phenomenological model
consisting of an exponentially cut-off power law plus a disc component. A more
physical model of thermal Comptonisation (and a disc) represents the spectra
equally well. In a first phase (up to MJD 54760), the photon index and
temperature of the disc do not vary significantly, and have values reminiscent
of the Hard State (HS). The timing analysis is also consistent with that of a
HS, and shows in particular a rather high degree of variability (~30%), and a
strong ~0.5-1 Hz QPO with its first harmonic. The timing and spectral
characteristics of H1743-322 are similar to those of the first HS during its
2003 outburst. After MJD 54760, a change to softer spectra and a ~5-6 Hz QPO
indicate that the source underwent a state transition into a Hard-Intermediate
State (HIMS). We observe in both states a correlation between the QPO frequency
and the photon index, which indicates a strong link between the accretion disc,
generally understood to determine the QPO frequency, and the corona, which
determines the QPO power. The gradual disappearance of the QPO harmonic, and
the slowly decreasing hard X-ray flux, imply that the accretion disc gradually
moved inwards during the HS.

  pages, 3 figures",,,,"cs.LO cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Logic programming has developed as a rich field, built over a logical
substratum whose main constituent is a nonclassical form of negation, sometimes
coexisting with classical negation. The field has seen the advent of a number
of alternative semantics, with Kripke-Kleene semantics, the well-founded
semantics, the stable model semantics, and the answer-set semantics standing
out as the most successful. We show that all aforementioned semantics are
particular cases of a generic semantics, in a framework where classical
negation is the unique form of negation and where the literals in the bodies of
the rules can be `marked' to indicate that they can be the targets of
hypotheses. A particular semantics then amounts to choosing a particular
marking scheme and choosing a particular set of hypotheses. When a literal
belongs to the chosen set of hypotheses, all marked occurrences of that literal
in the body of a rule are assumed to be true, whereas the occurrences of that
literal that have not been marked in the body of the rule are to be derived in
order to contribute to the firing of the rule. Hence the notion of hypothetical
reasoning that is presented in this framework is not based on making global
assumptions, but more subtly on making local, contextual assumptions, taking
effect as indicated by the chosen marking scheme on the basis of the chosen set
of hypotheses. Our approach offers a unified view on the various semantics
proposed in logic programming, classical in that only classical negation is
used, and links the semantics of logic programs to mechanisms that endow
rule-based systems with the power to harness hypothetical reasoning.

a surface deficit of (D-2)-sphere in AdS space, and they are not constant

naked conical singularities (topological defects) obtained by identification of

$f_0(1500)$ becomes a pure SU(3) octet and is degenerate with $a_0(1450)$,
while $f_0(1370)$ is mainly an SU(3) singlet with a slight mixing with the
scalar glueball which is the primary component of $f_0(1710)$. These features
remain essentially unchanged even when SU(3) breaking is taken into account.
The observed enhancement of $\omega f_0(1710)$ production over $\phi f_0(1710)$
in hadronic $J/\psi$ decays and the copious $f_0(1710)$ production in radiative
$J/\psi$ decays lend further support to the prominent glueball nature of
$f_0(1710)$. We deduce the mass of the pseudoscalar glueball $G$ from an
$\eta$-$\eta'$-$G$ mixing formalism based on the anomalous Ward identity for
transition matrix elements. With the inputs from the recent KLOE experiment, we
find a solution for the pseudoscalar glueball mass around $(1.4\pm 0.1)$ GeV,
which is fairly insensitive to a range of inputs with or without
Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka-rule violating effects. This affirms that $\eta(1405)$,
having a large production rate in the radiative $J/\psi$ decay and not seen in
$\gamma\gamma$ reactions, is indeed a leading candidate for the pseudoscalar
glueball. It is much lower than the results from quenched lattice QCD ($>2.0$
GeV) due to the dynamic fermion effect. It is thus urgent to have a full QCD
lattice calculation of pseudoscalar glueball masses.

control. Distributed connection preemption is an important example where nodes
can make intelligent decisions on allocating resources and controlling traffic
flows for multi-class service networks. A challenge is that nodal decisions are
spatially dependent as traffic flows trespass multiple nodes in a network.
Hence the performance-complexity trade-off becomes important, i.e., how
accurate decisions are versus how much information is exchanged among nodes.
Connection preemption is known to be NP-complete. Centralized preemption is
optimal but computationally intractable. Decentralized preemption is
computationally efficient but may result in a poor performance. This work
investigates distributed preemption where nodes decide whether and which flows
to preempt using only local information exchange with neighbors. We develop,
based on the probabilistic graphical models, a near-optimal distributed
algorithm. The algorithm is used by each node to make collectively near-optimal
preemption decisions. We study trade-offs between near-optimal performance and
complexity that corresponds to the amount of information-exchange of the
distributed algorithm. The algorithm is validated by both analysis and
simulation.

which produces the tachocline in the magnetic theory of Ruediger & Kitchatinov
(1997) is stable against nonaxisymmetric MHD disturbances -- but it becomes
unstable for rotation periods slightly slower than 25 days. The instability of
such weak fields lives from the high thermal diffusivity of stellar radiation
zones compared with the magnetic diffusivity. The growth times, however, result
as very long (of order of 10\^5 rotation times). With estimations of the
chemical mixing we find the maximal possible field amplitude to be ~500 Gauss
in order to explain the observed lithium abundance of the Sun. Dynamos with
such low field amplitudes should not be relevant for the solar activity cycle.
With nonlinear simulations of MHD Taylor-Couette flows it is shown that for the
rotation-dominated magnetic instability the resulting eddy viscosity is only of
the order of the molecular viscosity. The Schmidt number as the ratio of
viscosity and chemical diffusion grows to values of ~20. For the majority of
the stellar physics applications, the magnetic-dominated Tayler instability
will be quenched by the stellar rotation.

At this particular moment of a cluster's life, the colour distance between the
main sequence turn-off and the red clump(s) depends sensitively on the amount
of convective core overshooting, Lambda_c. By coupling measurements of this
colour separation with fits to the red clump morphology, we are able to
estimate simultaneously the cluster mean age (1.35(-0.04,+0.11) Gyr) and
overshooting efficiency (Lambda_c=0.47(-0.04,+0.14)). Therefore, clusters like
NGC419 may constitute important marks in the age scale of intermediate-age

five-torus. In addition to their energy, quantum states are characterized by
their spatial momentum, 't Hooft flux, and $Sp (4)$ $R$-symmetry
representation. The momentum obeys a shifted quantization law determined by the
't Hooft flux. By supersymmetry, the energy is bounded from below by the
magnitude of the momentum. This bound is saturated by BPS states, that are
annihilated by half of the supercharges. The spectrum of such states is
invariant under smooth deformations of the theory, and can thus be studied by
exploiting the interpretation of $(2, 0)$ theory as an ultra-violet completion
of maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on $R \times T^4$. Our main

and are strongly coupled. It is now generally accepted that ferroelectricity in
TbMnO3 is induced by magnetic long range order that breaks the symmetry of the
crystal and creates a polar axis [2]. One remaining key question is whether
magnetic order can induce ferroelectric polarization that is as large as that
of technologically useful materials. We show that ferroelectricity in
orthorhombic (o) TmMnO3 is induced by collinear magnetic order, and that the
lower limit for its electric polarization is larger than in previously
investigated orthorhombic heavy rare-earth manganites. The temperature
dependence of the lattice constants provides fur- ther evidence of large
spin-lattice coupling effects. Our experiments suggest that the ferroelectric
polarization in the orthorhombic perovskites with commensurate magnetic ground
states could pass the 1 microC/cm2 threshold, as suggested by theory [3, 4].

These observations are complemented with IRIS data at 100 and 60 microns and

dominated by the cosmic infrared background fluctuations, we observe a
substantial scatter in the 160/100 colors from cirrus emission. We compared the

of decreasing 60/100 with increasing 160/100. This trend can not be accounted
for by current dust models by changing solely the interstellar radiation field.
It requires a significant change of dust properties such as grain size

and mass range: 0.85 < M < 3.0 Msun, amounting to 20 stars in total. In this
paper, the first of a series describing and analysing this large data set, we
present the resulting stellar yields. Many of the models experience violent
nuclear burning episodes not seen at higher metallicities. We refer to these
events as `Dual Flashes'. These events have also been reported by previous
studies. Some of the material processed by the Dual Flashes is dredged up
causing significant surface pollution with a distinct chemical composition. We
also analyse the yields in terms of C and N, comparing them to the observed
CEMP abundances. At the lowest metallicities ([Fe/H] < -4.0) we find the yields
to contain ~1 to 2 dex too much carbon, in agreement with all previous studies.
At higher metallicities ([Fe/H] = -3.0), where the observed data set is much
larger, all our models produce yields with [C/Fe] values consistent with those
observed in the most C-rich CEMPs. However it is only the low-mass models that
undergo the Dual Shell Flash (which occurs at the start of the TPAGB) that can
best reproduce the C and N observations. Normal Third Dredge-Up can not
reproduce the observations because at these metallicities intermediate mass
models (M > 2 Msun) suffer HBB which converts the C to N thus lowering [C/N]
well below the observations, whilst if TDU were to occur in the low-mass (M < 1
Msun) models (we do not find it to occur in our models), the yields would be
expected to be C-rich only, which is at odds with the `dual pollution' of C and
N generally observed in the CEMPs.

rank and arrange all pixels of a monochromatic raster scan by radiance and
define equally-sized bins of bright, faint, and medium-bright pixels. Comparing
the bright pixels with the faint pixels, we determine the spectrally-resolved
network contrast for 19 emission lines. We then compare the contrast centroids
of these lines with the position of the line itself. We establish a
relationship between the observed redshift of the network contrast with the
line formation temperature. Results: We find that the network contrast is
offset in wavelength compared to the emission line itself. This offset, if
interpreted as redshift, peaks at middle transition region temperatures and is
10 times higher than the previously reported net redshift of transition region
emission lines. We demonstrate that the brighter pixels are more redshifted,
causing both a significant shift of the network contrast profile and the
well-known net redshift. We show that this effect can be reconstructed from the
radiance distribution. This result is compatible with loop models, which assume
downflows near both footpoints.

at one point, the response signal will generally decay down the chain due to
absorption and radiation losses. The decay length is a key parameter in such
plasmonic systems. By studying the plasmon lattice Green's function, we found
that the decay length is generally governed by two exponential decay constants
with phase factors corresponding to guided Bloch modes and one power-law decay
with a phase factor corresponding to that of free space photons. The results
show a high level of similarity between the absorptive and radiative decay
channels. By analyzing the poles (and the corresponding residues) of the
Green's function in a transformed complex reciprocal space, the dominant decay
channel of the real-space Green's function is understood.

Although QUaD-only parameter constraints are not competitive with previous
results for the standard 6-parameter LCDM cosmology, they do allow meaningful
polarization-only parameter analyses for the first time. In a standard
6-parameter LCDM analysis we find the QUaD TT power spectrum to be in good
agreement with previous results. However, the QUaD polarization data shows some
tension with LCDM. The origin of this 1 to 2 sigma tension remains unclear, and
may point to new physics, residual systematics or simple random chance. We also
combine QUaD with the five-year WMAP data set and the SDSS Luminous Red

While identification of the metastable state can be done at the infinitesimally

of M31 of 93 and 130 kpc respectively. These satellites lie to the South of
M31, in regions of the stellar halo which wide field imaging has revealed as
relative voids (compared to the degree-scale coherent stream-like structures).
Using the DEep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph mounted on the Keck II
telescope, we have defined probable members of these satellites, for which we
derive radial velocities as precise as ~6 km/s down to i~21.5. While the
distance to And XVI remains the same as previously reported (525pm50 kpc), we
have demonstrated that the brightest three stars previously used to define the
tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) in And XV are in fact Galactic, and And XV
is actually likely to be much more distant at 770pm70 kpc (compared to the
previous 630 kpc), increasing the luminosity from MV -9.4 to MV~-9.8. The And
XV velocity dispersion is resolved with vr =-339+7-6 km/s and sigma-v = 11+7-5
km/s. The And XVI dispersion is not quite resolved at 1sigma with vr =-385+5-6
km/s and sigma-v = 0+10-indef km/s. Using the photometry of the confirmed
member stars, we find metallicities of And XV (median [Fe/H]=-1.58, interquar-
tile range +-0.08), and And XVI (median [Fe/H]=-2.23, interquartile range
+-0.12). Stacking the spectra of the member stars, we find spectroscopic
[Fe/H]=-1.8 (-2.1) for And XV (And XVI), with a uncertainty of ~0.2 dex in both
cases. Our measure- ments of And XV reasonably resolve its mass (~10^8 Msun)
and suggest a polar orbit, while the velocity of And XVI suggests it is
approaching the M31 escape velocity given its large M31-centric distance.

clouds. The observations of polarized dust emission are used to study the role
of magnetic fields in the evolution of molecular clouds and the initial phases
of star-formation. We study the grain alignment with realistic simulations,
assuming the radiative torques to be the main mechanism that spins the grains
up. The aim is to study the efficiency of the grain alignment as a function of
cloud position and to study the observable consequences of these spatial
variations. Our results are based on the analysis of model clouds derived from
MHD simulations. The continuum radiative transfer problem is solved with Monte
Carlo methods to estimate the 3D distribution of dust emission and the
radiation field strength affecting the grain alignment. We also examine the
effect of grain growth in cores. We are able to reproduce the results of Cho &
Lazarian using their assumptions. However, the anisotropy factor even in the 1D
case is lower than their assumption of $\gamma = 0.7$, and thus we get less
efficient radiative torques. Compared with our previous paper, the polarization
degree vs. intensity relation is steeper because of less efficient grain
alignment within dense cores. Without grain growth, the magnetic field of the
cores is poorly recovered above a few $A_{\rm V}$. If grain size is doubled in
the cores, the polarization of dust emission can trace the magnetic field lines
possibly up to $A_{\rm V} \sim 10$ magnitudes. However, many of the prestellar
cores may be too young for grain coagulation to play a major role. The
inclusion of direction dependent radiative torque efficiency weakens the
alignment. Even with doubled grain size, we would not expect to probe the
magnetic field past a few magnitudes in $A_{\rm V}$.

with the environment, but they are often difficult to measure. Here we report
measurements of the transient cumulants <<n^m>> of the number n of passed

quantum dot. For large m, the cumulants display striking oscillations as
functions of measurement time with magnitudes that grow factorially with m.
Using mathematical properties of high-order derivatives in the complex plane we
show that the oscillations of the cumulants in fact constitute a universal
phenomenon, appearing as functions of almost any parameter, including time in
the transient regime. These ubiquitous oscillations and the factorial growth
are system-independent and our theory provides a unified interpretation of
previous theoretical studies of high-order cumulants as well as our new

with field-star-decontaminated 2MASS photometry, which shows the main-sequence
(MS) stars and an abundant pre-MS (PMS) population. Fundamental and structural
parameters were derived with colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), stellar radial
density profiles (RDPs) and mass functions (MFs). Most previous studies centred
NGC 2244 close to the bright K0V star 12 Monocerotis, which is not a cluster
member. Instead, the near-IR RDP indicates a pronounced core near the O5 star
HD 46150. We derive an age within 1--6 Myr, an absorption $\aV=1.7\pm0.2$, a
distance from the Sun $\ds=1.6\pm0.2$ kpc ($\approx1.5$ kpc outside the Solar
circle), an MF slope $\chi=0.91\pm0.13$ and a total (MS+PMS) stellar mass of
$\sim625 \ms$. Its RDP is characterised by the core and cluster radii
$\rc\approx5.6\arcmin$ ($\approx2.6$ pc) and $\rl\approx10\arcmin$
($\approx4.7$ pc), respectively. Departure from dynamical equilibrium is
suggested by the abnormally large core radius and the marked central stellar
excess. We also investigate the elusive neighbouring OC NGC 2239, which is
low-mass ($m_{MS+PMS}\approx301 \ms$), young ($5\pm4$ Myr) rather absorbed
($\aV=3.4\pm0.2$), and located in the background of NGC 2244 at $\ds=3.9\pm0.4$
kpc. Its RDP follows a King-like function of $\rc\approx0.5\arcmin\approx0.5$
pc and $\rl\approx5.0\arcmin\approx5.6$ pc. The MF slope, $\chi=1.24\pm0.06$,
is essentially Salpeter's IMF. NGC 2244 is probably doomed to dissolution in a
few $10^7$ yr. Wide-field extractions and field-star decontamination increase
the stellar statistics and enhance both CMDs and RDPs, which is essential for
faint and bright star clusters.
