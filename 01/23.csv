massive z = 2.2 radio galaxy in a protocluster and the probable progenitor of a
brightest cluster galaxy. Nearby protocluster galaxies are identified and their
properties are determined by fitting stellar population models to their
rest-frame ultraviolet to optical spectral energy distributions. We find that
within 150 kpc of the radio galaxy the stellar mass is centrally concentrated
in the radio galaxy, yet most of the dust-uncorrected, instantaneous star
formation occurs in the surrounding low-mass satellite galaxies. We predict
that most of the galaxies within 150 kpc of the radio galaxy will merge with
the central radio galaxy by z = 0, increasing its stellar mass by up to a
factor of ~ 2. However, it will take several hundred Myr for the first mergers
to occur, by which time the large star formation rates are likely to have
exhausted the gas reservoirs in the satellite galaxies. The tidal radii of the
satellite galaxies are small, suggesting that stars and gas are being stripped
and deposited at distances of tens of kpc from the central radio galaxy. These
stripped stars may become intracluster stars or form an extended stellar halo
around the radio galaxy, such as those observed around cD galaxies in cluster
cores.

channels involving top, and, sometimes, bottom quarks. This is a generic
signature for a number of supersymmetry breaking scenarios considered recently,
where the squarks are heavier than gauginos. Third generation final states
generically dominate since third generation squarks are typically somewhat
lighter in these models. At the LHC we demonstrate that early discovery is
possible due to the existence of multi-lepton multi-bottom final states which
have fairly low Standard Model background. We find that the best discovery
channel is 'same sign dilepton'. The relative decay branching ratios into tt,
tb and bb states carry important information about the underlying model.
Although reconstruction will yield evidence for the existence of top quarks in
the event, we demonstrate that identifying multiple top quarks suffers from low
efficiency and large combinatorial background, due to the large number of final
state particles. We propose a fitting method which takes advantage of excesses
in a large number of channels. We demonstrate such a method will allow us to
extract information about decay branching ratios with moderate integrated
luminosities. In addition, the method also gives an upper bound on the gluino
production cross section and an estimate of the gluino mass.

We also used SDSS spectra to probe MgII2798 and CIV1549 emission lines and used
these for black hole mass measurements as well. The massive black holes we
observe could not have grown by simple radiatively efficient accretion at the
observed accretion rate starting from seeds of up to thousand solar masses.
About 10% of the observed black hole mass must have been accumulated by earlier
merger events and radiatively inefficient accretion. Radiatively efficient
accretion would further grow these BHs to masses of several 10^9 Msol in 2 to 3
e-folding times i.e. in several 10^8yrs. The Hb-based Eddington luminosity
ratios are in the range of ~0.2 to ~0.7, with an average of (Lbol/Ledd) =
0.39+-0.05. The Lbol/Ledd ratio distribution follows a log-normal distribution
which is consistent with prior studies of quasars with comparable luminosity.
The Lbol/Ledd ratio distribution of less luminous quasars tend to be shifted to
lower Eddington ratios. We also find that the gas metallicity of the broad-line
region is ~3Z/Zsol, using NIII]/OIII] and NV/CIV emission line ratios. We find
no correlation of the gas metallicity with the optical FeII emission line

properties, such as the field strength and the axis alignment, are unknown in a
majority of these systems. Aims. We undertake to put all the previous circular
polarization measurements into context and systematically survey intermediate
polars for signs of circular polarization, hence to get an indication of their
true magnetic field strengths and try to understand the evolution of magnetic
cataclysmic variables. Methods. We used the TurPol instrument at the Nordic
Optical Telescope to obtain simultaneous UBVRI photo-polarimetric observations
of a set of intermediate polars, during the epoch 2006 July 31 - August 2.
Results. Of this set of eight systems two (1RXS J213344.1+510725 and 1RXS
J173021.5-055933) were found to show significant levels of circular
polarization, varying with spin phase. Five others (V2306 Cyg, AO Psc, DQ Her,
FO Aqr, and V1223 Sgr) show some evidence for circular polarization and
variation of this with spin phase, whilst AE Aqr shows little evidence for
polarized emission. We also report the first simultaneous UBVRI photometry of
the newly identified intermediate polar 1RXS J173021.5-055933. Conclusions.
Circular polarization may be ubiquitous in intermediate polars, albeit at a low
level of one or two percent or less. It is stronger at longer wavelengths in
the visible spectrum. Our results lend further support to the possible link
between the presence of soft X-ray components and the detectability of circular
polarization in intermediate polars.

initial mass function and of the selection band. Using Charlot & Bruzual 2007
and Maraston 2005 models we find masses lower than those obtained from Bruzual

mass itself comparing these two mass determinations with that from Bruzual &
Charlot 2003 models. As consequence, the derived galaxy stellar mass functions
show diverse shapes, and their slope depends on the assumed models. Despite
these differences, the overall results and scenario remains unchanged. The
masses obtained with the assumption of the Chabrier initial mass function are
in average 0.24 dex lower than those from the Salpeter assumption, at all
redshifts, causing a shift of galaxy stellar mass function of the same amount.

new population of highly absorbed, dusty galaxies at z\simeq 2-3 of relatively
low masses, yielding stronger constraints on the slope of the galaxy stellar

H? The most famous examples of results of this kind are probably Dirac's
theorem on Hamilton cycles and Tutte's theorem on perfect matchings. Perfect
matchings are generalized by perfect F-packings, where instead of covering all
the vertices of G by disjoint edges, we want to cover G by disjoint copies of a
(small) graph F. It is unlikely that there is a characterization of all graphs
G which contain a perfect F-packing, so as in the case of Dirac's theorem it
makes sense to study conditions on the minimum degree of G which guarantee a
perfect F-packing.
  The Regularity lemma of Szemeredi and the Blow-up lemma of Komlos, Sarkozy
and Szemeredi have proved to be powerful tools in attacking such problems and
quite recently, several long-standing problems and conjectures in the area have
been solved using these. In this survey, we give an outline of recent progress
(with our main emphasis on F-packings, Hamiltonicity problems and tree

techniques with focus on half-filling and on the state with two more electrons
than half-filling and (ii) to investigate the nodal structure of the mean-field

data. In particular, we provide evidence that at half-filling spin 'stripes',
as observed experimentally, dominate over competing states.
  Depending on parameters, the state with two more electrons added to half
filling is either triplet or singlet. Since experiments suggest spin singlet
pairs, our focus is on this state. Under rotation, it transforms as the B_2g
representation of the D_4h group. We also show that the s+/- pairing operator
transforms as A_1g and becomes dominant only in an unphysical regime of the
model where the undoped state is an insulator. For robust values of the
effective electronic attraction producing the Cooper pairs, assumption
compatible with recent angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) results that
suggesting small Cooper-pair size, the nodes of the two-orbital model are found
to be located only at the electron pockets. Since recent ARPES efforts have
searched for nodes at the hole pockets or only in a few directions at the
electron pockets, our results for the nodal distribution may help to guide
future experiments. More in general, the investigations reported here aim to
establish several of the properties of the two orbital model. Only a detailed
comparison with experiments will clarify how far this simple model present a
valid description of the Fe pnictides.

answer three questions: what is the most appropriate functional to use; how

where do they lie on the surface phase diagram. Using test calculations of
representative small molecules we compare conventional GGA with higher-order
methods such as the TPSS meta-GGA and on-site hybrid methods PBE0 and TPSSh,
the later being the most accurate. There are large effects due to reduction of
the metal d oxygen sp hybridization when using the hybrid methods which are
equivalent to a dynamical GGA+U, which leads to rather substantial improvements
in the atomization energies of simple calibration molecules, even though the
d-electron density for titanium compounds is rather small. By comparing the
errors of the different methods we are able to generate an estimate of the
theoretical error, which is about 0.25eV per 1x1 unit cell, with changes of
0.5-1.0 eV per 1x1 cell with the more accurate method relative to conventional
GGA. An analysis of the plausible structures reveals an unusual low-energy
TiO2-rich configuration with an unexpected distorted trigonal biprismatic
structure. This structure can act as a template for layers of either TiO or
Ti2O3, consistent with experimental results as well as, in principle, Magnelli

comparable to the isotropic X-ray luminosity of the entire X-ray jet of

than that of the brightest hotspot in Cygnus A. We model the radio to X-ray
spectral energy distribution using a one-zone synchrotron self Compton model
with a near equipartition magnetic field strength of 3 mG. There is a strong
brightness asymmetry between the approaching and receding hotspots and the hot
spot spectrum remains flat (alpha ~ 0.5) well beyond the predicted cooling
break for a 3 mG magnetic field, indicating that the hotspot emission may be
Doppler beamed. A high plasma velocity beyond the terminal jet shock could be
the result of a dynamically important magnetic field in the jet. There is a
change in the slope of the hotspot radio spectrum at GHz frequencies from
alpha~0.5 to alpha<0.2, which we model by incorporating a cut-off in the
electron energy distribution at gamma_{min} ~ 650, with higher values implied
if the hotspot emission is Doppler beamed. We show that a sharp decrease in the
electron number density below a Lorentz factor of 650 would arise from the

along with a Gpc-scale N-body simulation to understand the impact of
inhomogeneous reionization on the satellite galaxy population of the Milky Way.
The large-volume simulation is combined with a model for reionization that
allows us to predict the distribution of reionization times for Milky Way mass
halos. Motivated by this distribution, we identify candidate satellite galaxies
in the simulation by requiring that any subhalo must grow above a specified
mass threshold before it is reionized; after this time the photoionizing
background will suppress both the formation of stars and the accretion of gas.
We show that varying the reionization time over the range expected for Milky
Way mass halos can change the number of satellite galaxies by roughly two
orders of magnitude. This conclusion is in contradiction with a number of
studies in the literature, and we conclude that this is a result of
inconsistent application of the results of Gnedin (2000). We compare our
satellite galaxies to observations using both abundance matching and stellar
population synthesis methods to assign luminosities to our subhalos and account
for observational completeness effects. Additionally, if we assume that the
mass threshold is set by the virial temperature Tvir = 8e3K we find that our
model accurately matches the vmax distribution, radial distribution, and
luminosity function of observed Milky Way satellites for a reionization time
zreion = 9.6^{1.0}_{-2.1}, assuming that the Via Lacteasubhalo distribution is
representative of the Milky Way. This results in the presence of

agreement with earlier works of Tully & Verheijen and ours for Ursa Major

galaxy disks. The difference between the low and high brightness peaks of Virgo
disk galaxies is ~2 H-mag arcsec^-2, significantly larger than any systematic
errors. The high surface brightness disk galaxies have two distinct classes of
high and low concentration bulges, while low surface brightness galaxies have
only low concentration bulges. Early-type galaxies exhibit a similar structural
bimodality though offset from that of the spiral galaxies towards higher
surface brightnesses. Both the early- and late-type structural bimodalities are
uncorrelated with colour or any other structural parameter except, possibly,
circular velocity. The structural bimodality may be linked to dynamical
properties of galaxies. Low angular momentum systems may collapse to form
dynamically important disks with high surface brightness, while high angular
momentum systems would end up as low surface brightness galaxies dominated by
the dark halo at all radii. The confirmation of structural bimodality for
gas-rich and gas-poor galaxies in the high-density Virgo cluster as well as the
low-density UMa cluster suggests that this phenomenon is independent of

cosmic shear measurements using the concepts of complexity and sparsity.
Complexity, introduced in a previous paper, characterizes the number of degrees
of freedom of the PSF. For instance, fitting an underlying PSF with a model
with low complexity will lead to small statistical errors on the model
parameters, however these parameters could suffer from large biases.
Alternatively, fitting with a large number of parameters will tend to reduce
biases at the expense of statistical errors. We perform an optimisation of
scatters and biases by studying the mean squared error of a PSF model. We also
characterize a model sparsity, which describes how efficiently the model is
able to represent the underlying PSF using a limited number of free parameters.
We present the general case and illustrate it for a realistic example of PSF
fitted with shapelet basis sets. We derive the relation between complexity and
sparsity of the PSF model, signal-to-noise ratio of stars and systematic errors
on cosmological parameters. With the constraint of maintaining the systematics
below the statistical uncertainties, this lead to a relation between the
required number of stars to calibrate the PSF and the sparsity. We discuss the
impact of our results for current and future cosmic shear surveys. In the
typical case where the biases can be represented as a power law of the
complexity, we show that current weak lensing surveys can calibrate the PSF
with few stars, while future surveys will require hard constraints on the
sparsity in order to calibrate the PSF with 50 stars.

which, through its coupling to the quarks in a bound nucleon, implies a shift
in the quark distributions with respect to the Bjorken scaling variable. We
show that this result leads to an additional correction to the NuTeV
measurement of sin^2(Theta_W). The sign of this correction is largely model
independent and acts to reduce their result. Explicit calculation within a
covariant and confining Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model predicts that this vector
field correction accounts for approximately two-thirds of the NuTeV anomaly. We
are therefore led to offer a new interpretation of the NuTeV measurement,
namely, that it is further evidence for the medium modification of the bound
nucleon wavefunction.

potentials are smooth, we prove that the wave functions and energy levels have
asymptotic expansions in powers of epsilon, where epsilon^4 is the ratio of an
electron mass to the mass of a nucleus. To prove the validity of the expansion,
we must prove various properties of the leading order equations and their
solutions. The leading order eigenvalue problem is analyzed in terms of a
parameter b, which is equivalent to the parameter originally used by Renner.
For 0 < b < 1, we prove self-adjointness of the leading order Hamiltonian, that
it has purely discrete spectrum, and that its eigenfunctions and their
derivatives decay exponentially. Perturbation theory and finite difference
calculations suggest that the ground bending vibrational state is involved in a
level crossing near b = 0.925. We also discuss the degeneracy of the
eigenvalues. Because of the crossing, the ground state is degenerate for 0 < b
< 0.925 and non-degenerate for 0.925 < b < 1.

using the DFT-based Vienna ab-inito simulation package. The bonding nature of
atoms in the optimized structures has been examined using a local analysis
technique based on a self-consistent and environment-dependent semi-empirical
Hamiltonian. Results of our studies reveal that stabilized SiC graphitic-like
layer structures possess the sp2 bonding nature, different from the sp3 bonding
nature in bulk SiC. Such flexibility in bonding configurations between Si and C
atoms holds the possibility for a wide range of stable SiC-based structures,
similar to those for carbon-based structures. In the case of SiC-based
nanotubes, we have calculated quantities such as the strain energy, the degree
of buckle in the cylindrical shell, and bond charges between Si and C atoms, to
obtain an understanding of the optimized structures. The optimized interlayer
spacing of SiC graphitic-like multilayer sheets has been found to depend on the
ordering of atoms in different layers of the SiC graphitic-like structure (0.37
nm for the Si-C sequence of bilayer arrangement versus 0.48 nm for either the
Si-Si or the C-C sequence of bilayer arrangement). These observations may be
attributed to the Coulomb interactions due to the charge redistribution among
Si and C atoms. On the other hand, the existence of two different ranges of
interlayer separation in SiC double-walled nanotubes (0.38 nm for zigzag and
0.48 nm for armchair) is found to be related to whether the dominant interlayer
neighbors are of the Si-C type or the Si-Si and C-C types.

with the VLT on three nights (July 8th, 12th, and August 17th), after the X-ray
source rebrightening and during the subsequent decay reported around June 2007.
We detected four objects within, or close to, the 3sigma radio position of 1E

0.05, which would yield an unabsorbed X-ray to NIR flux ratio FX/FKs ~ 800 for
1E 1547.0-5408, i.e. on average lower than those derived for other magnetars.
The non-detection of object 1 on the nights of July 8th and August 17th only
allowed us to set an upper limit of Delta Ks ~ 0.2 on its NIR variability,
which prevented us to search for correlations with the radio or X-ray flux. We
detected no other object at the radio position down to a limit of Ks ~ 21.7 (at

associated vector field is a discontinuous function of the state. Discontinuous
dynamical systems arise in a large number of applications, including optimal
control, nonsmooth mechanics, and robotic manipulation. Independently of the
particular application, one always faces similar questions when dealing with
discontinuous dynamical systems. The most basic one is the notion of solution.
We begin by introducing the notions of Caratheodory, Filippov and
sample-and-hold solutions, discuss existence and uniqueness results for them,
and examine various examples. We also give specific pointers to other notions
of solution defined in the literature. Once the notion of solution has been
settled, we turn our attention to the analysis of stability of discontinuous
systems. We introduce the concepts of generalized gradient of locally Lipschitz
functions and proximal subdifferential of lower semicontinuous functions.
Building on these notions, we establish monotonic properties of candidate
Lyapunov functions along the solutions. These results are key in providing
suitable generalizations of Lyapunov stability theorems and the LaSalle
Invariance Principle. We illustrate the applicability of these results in a
class of nonsmooth gradient flows.

found that if mixed boundary conditions are assumed on the piston and its

towards the equilibrium position, regardless of the boundary conditions assumed
on the walls transverse to the piston. In contrary, if pure boundary conditions
are assumed on the piston and the opposite wall, then the Casimir force always
tend to pull the piston towards the closer wall and away from the equilibrium

the high temperature regime, the magnitude of the Casimir force grows linearly
with respect to temperature. This shows that the Casimir effect has a classical

lepton-number violating ($\lv$) processes from the decays of tau leptons and
pseudoscalar mesons. These decays are absent in the Standard Model but, in
presence of Majorana neutrinos in the mass range $\sim 100 \mev$ to $5 \gev$,
the rates for these processes would be enhanced due to their resonant
contribution. We calculate the transition rates and branching fractions and
compare them to the current bounds from direct experimental searches for
$\dl=2$ tau and rare meson decays. The experimental non-observation of such
$\lv$ processes places stringent bounds on the Majorana neutrino mass and
mixing and we summarize the existing limits. We also extend the search to
hadron collider experiments. We find that, at the Tevatron with $8 {fb}^{-1}$
integrated luminosity, there could be $2\sigma$ ($5\sigma$) sensitivity for
resonant production of a Majorana neutrino in the $\mu^\pm \mu^\pm$ modes in
the mass range of $\sim 10 - 180 {\gev} (10 - 120 {\gev})$. This reach can be
extended to $\sim 10 - 375 {\gev} (10 - 250 mbox{\gev})$ at the LHC of 14 TeV

presented for comparison. We study the $\mu^\pm e^\pm$ modes as well and find
that the signal could be large enough even taking into account the current
bound from neutrinoless double-beta decay. The signal from the gauge boson
fusion channel $W^+ W^+\to \ell^+_1 \ell^+_2$ at the LHC is found to be very

nonthermal sources that are located above the flare loops during the preflare

sources both in microwaves and in HXRs, and confirmed that electrons are
accelerated from several tens of keV to more than 1 MeV even in this phase. If
we assume the thin-target model for the HXR emission source, the derived
electron spectral indices ($\sim 4.7$) is the same value as that from
microwaves ($\sim 4.7$) within the observational uncertainties, which implies
that the distribution of the accelerated electrons follows a single power-law.
The number density of the microwave-emitting electrons is, however, larger than
that of the HXR-emitting electrons, unless we assume low ambient plasma density
of about $1.0 \times 10^9$ cm$^{-3}$ for the HXR-emitting region. If we adopt
the thick-target model for the HXR emission source, on the other hand, the
electron spectral index ($\sim 6.7$) is much different, while the gap of the

scaling laws concerning the p- and s-nuclei with the same atomic number. The
first scaling is s/p ratios are almost constant over a wide range of the atomic
number, where the p-nculei are lighter than the s-nuclei by two or four
neutrons. The second scaling is p/p ratios are almost constant, where the
second $p$-nuclei are lighter than the first p-nucleus by two neutrons. These
scalings are a piece of evidence that most p-nuclei are dominantly synthesized
by the gamma-process in supernova explosions. The scalings lead to a novel
concept of ""universality of gamma-process"" that the s/p and p/p ratios of
nuclei produced by individual gamma-processes are almost constant,
respectively. We have calculated the ratios by gamma-process based on
core-collapse supernova explosion models under various astrophysical conditions
and found that the scalings hold for materials produced by individual
gamma-processes independent of the astrophysical conditions assumed. The
universality originates from three mechanisms: the shifts of the gamma-process
layers to keep their peak temperature, the weak s-process in pre-supernovae,
and the independence of the s/p ratios of the nuclear reactions. The results
further suggest an extended universality that the s/p ratios in the
gamma-process layers are not only constant but also centered on a specific
value of 3. With this specific value and the first scaling, we estimate that
the ratios of $s$-process abundance contributions from the AGB stars to the
massive stars are almost 6.7 for the $s$-nuclei of A > 90. We find that large
enhancements of s/p ratios for Ce, Er, and W are a piece of evidence that the
weak s-process actually occurred before SNe.

different species propagate with different speeds due to their direct couplings
to ghost condensate. It was argued that this extended version of ghost
condensate allows a gedanken experiment leading to violation of the generalized
second law. However, in the original ghost condensate scenario, difference in
propagation speeds is suppressed by M^2/M_{Pl}^2, where M is the order
parameter of spontaneous Lorentz breaking and M_{Pl} is the Planck scale. In
this case the energy transfer necessary for the gedanken experiment is so slow
that the timescale of decrease of entropy, if any, is always longer than the
Jeans timescale of ghost condensate. Hence the generalized second law is not
violated by the gedanken experiment in the original ghost condensate scenario.
This conclusion trivially extends to gauged ghost condensation by taking into
account accretion of gauged ghost condensate into a black hole.

lightcurves of GRB afterglows. We have found, through analysis of the

first 500s after the GRB trigger, that all lightcurves decay after 500s,
typically as a power-law with a relatively narrow distribution of decay
indices, and that the brightest optical afterglows tend to decay the quickest.
We find that the rise could either be produced physically by the start of the
forward shock, when the jet begins to plough into the external medium, or
geometrically where an off-axis observer sees a rising lightcurve as an
increasing amount of emission enters the observers line of sight, which occurs
as the jet slows. We find that at 99.8% confidence, there is a correlation, in
the observed frame, between the apparent magnitude of the lightcurves at 400s
and the rate of decay after 500s. However, in the rest frame a Spearman Rank
test shows only a weak correlation of low statistical significance between
luminosity and decay rate. A correlation should be expected if the afterglows
were produced by off-axis jets, suggesting that the jet is viewed from within
the half-opening angle theta or within a core of uniform energy density
theta_c. We also produced logarithmic luminosity distributions for three rest
frame epochs. We find no evidence for bimodality in any of the distributions.
Finally, we compare our sample of UVOT lightcurves with the XRT lightcurve
canonical model. The range in decay indices seen in UVOT lightcurves at any
epoch is most similar to the range in decay of the shallow decay segment of the
XRT canonical model. However, in the XRT canonical model there is no indication

maximizing his own payoff, will there exist any equilibrium for the society?
John Nash proved more than 50 years ago that an equilibrium always exists such
that nobody would benefit from unilaterally changing his strategy. Nash
Equilibrium is a central concept in game theory, which offers the mathematical
foundation for social science and economy. However, the original definition is
declarative without including a solution to find them. It has been found later
that it is computationally difficult to find a Nash equilibrium. Furthermore, a
Nash equilibrium may be unstable, sensitive to the smallest variation of payoff
functions. Making the situation worse, a society with selfish individuals can
have an enormous number of equilibria, making it extremely hard to find out the
global optimal one. This paper offers a constructive generalization of Nash
equilibrium to cover the case when the selfishness of individuals are reduced
to lower levels in a controllable way. It shows that the society has one and
only one equilibrium when the selfishness is reduced to a certain level. When
every individual follows the iterative, soft-decision optimization process
presented in this paper, the society converges to the unique equilibrium with
an exponential rate under any initial conditions. When it is a consensus
equilibrium at the same time, it must be the global optimum. The study of this
paper suggests that, to build a good, stable society (including the financial
market) for the benefit everyone in it, the pursuing of maximal payoff by each
individual should be controlled at some level either by voluntary good
citizenship or some proper regulations.

First, both partners are good donors and acceptors of electrons, which
significantly complicates the intermolecular interaction between them leading
to a two-well shape of the ground state energy term. The second problem
concerns odd-electron character of the components. Similarly to high aromatics
and fullerenes, much larger C-C distances provide a considerable weakening of
odd electrons interaction in nanotubes and graphene that necessitates taking
the configurational interaction of odd electrons into account. Avoiding a
severe complication, the broken spin-symmetry approach makes the problem
feasible. Moreover, unrestricted broken-symmetry Hartree-Fock approach
possesses a unique sensitivity in revealing enhanced chemical activity of the
species caused by their partial radicalization in terms of atomic chemical
susceptibility. The chemical susceptibility profiles along the tube and across
their body as well as over graphene sheets form the ground of computational
synthesis of graphen-nanotube composites in due course of the relevant addition
reactions and make it possible to select two main groups of the composites,
conditionally called hammer and cutting-blade structures. The final product
will depend on whether both components of the composition are freely accessible
or one of them is fixed. Thus, in diluted solutions where the first requirement
is met, one can expect the formation of the multi-addend cutting-blade
composites. Oppositely, when either nanotubes or graphene sheets are fixed on
some substrates, the hammer composites will be formed. A particular ""cradle""

by a channel form an operator algebra which can be characterized in terms of
the channel's elements. The effect of the channel on these observables can be

that the only type of information which can be duplicated arbitrarily many

analyzing SPNs is information theoretic. We define an SPN as a network with
multiple nodes that each produce noisy and compressed measurements of the same
information. An SPN must combine all these measurements into a single further
compressed network output, in a way dictated solely by naturally occurring
physical properties -- i.e. pooling -- and yet causes no (or negligible)
reduction in mutual information. This means SPNs exhibit redundancy reduction
as an emergent property of pooling. The SPN concept is applicable to examples
in biological neural coding, nano-electronics, distributed sensor networks,
digital beamforming arrays, image processing, multiaccess communication
networks and social networks. In most cases the randomness is assumed to be
unavoidably present rather than deliberately introduced. We illustrate the
central properties of SPNs for several case studies, where pooling occurs by
summation, including nodes that are noisy scalar quantizers, and nodes with
conditionally Poisson statistics. Other emergent properties of SPNs and some
unsolved problems are also briefly discussed.

on the collective dynamics [V. Krakoviack, Phys. Rev. E 75, 031503 (2007)]. Its
equations, like the previous ones, reflect the interplay between
confinement-induced relaxation phenomena and glassy dynamics through the
presence of two contributions in the slow part of the memory kernel, which are
linear and quadratic in the density correlation functions, respectively. From
numerical solutions for two simple models with pure hard core interactions, it
is shown that two different scenarios result for the diffusion-localization
transition, depending on the strength of the confinement. For weak confinement,
this transition is discontinuous and coincides with the ideal glass transition,
like in one-component bulk systems, while, for strong confinement, it is
continuous and occurs before the collective dynamics gets nonergodic. In the
latter case, the glass transition manifests itself as a secondary transition,
which can be either continuous or discontinuous, in the already arrested
single-particle dynamics. The main features of the anomalous dynamics found in
the vicinity of all these transitions are reviewed and illustrated with

controversial in the past years. The main difficulty is in determining the
required parameters for intermediate and high redshift galaxies.
  This work aims to identify the main problems of the study of the Tully-Fisher
relation at high redshift using optical emission lines, in order to draw
conclusions about the possible evolution of this relation in the B, R, and
I-bands.
  With this aim, the rotational velocities obtained from the widths of
different optical lines using DEEP2 spectra are compared. Morphology has been
determined via HST images, using and comparing different methodologies.
Instrumental magnitudes are then corrected for K and extinction and the
absolute magnitudes derived for the concordance cosmological model. Finally,
the optical Tully-Fisher relations in B, R, and I-bands at different redshifts
up to z = 1.3 are derived.
  Although most studies (this one included) find evidence of evolution, the
results are not conclusive enough, since the possible luminosity evolution is
within the scattering of the relation, and the evolution in slope is difficult
to determine because at high redshift only the brightest galaxies can be
measured. Nevertheless, our study shows a clear tendency, which is the same for
all bands studied, that favours a luminosity evolution where galaxies were
brighter in the past for the same rotation velocity. This result also implies
that the colour of the Tully-Fisher relation does not change with redshift,
supporting the collapse model versus the accretion model of disc galaxy
formation.

detonation in the degenerate C/O material of a white dwarf. The length scales
pertinent to the initiation of the detonation are notoriously unresolved in
multi-dimensional stellar simulations, prompting the use of results of 1D
simulations at higher resolution, such as the ones performed for this work, as
guidelines for deciding whether or not conditions reached in the higher
dimensional full star simulations successfully would lead to the onset of a
detonation. Spontaneous initiation relies on the existence of a suitable
gradient in self-ignition (induction) times of the fuel, which we set up with a
spatially localized non-uniformity of temperature -- a hot spot. We determine
the critical (smallest) sizes of such hot spots that still marginally result in
a detonation in white dwarf matter by integrating the reactive Euler equations
with the hydrodynamics code FLASH. We quantify the dependences of the critical
sizes of such hot spots on composition, background temperature, peak
temperature, geometry, and functional form of the temperature disturbance, many
of which were hitherto largely unexplored in the literature. We discuss the
implications of our results in the context of modeling of SNe Ia.

magnetic field configurations. Methods. Numerical simulations of wave
propagation through the solar sub-photosphere with a localised magnetic field
concentration are carried out using SAC, which solves the MHD equations for
gravitationally stratified plasma. The initial equilibrium density and pressure
stratifications are derived from a standard solar model. Acoustic waves are
generated by a source located at the height approximately corresponding to the
visible surface of the Sun. We analyse the response of vertical velocity to
changes in the interior due to magnetic field at the level corresponding to the
visible solar surface, by the means of local time-distance helioseismology.
Results. The results of numerical simulations of acoustic wave propagation and
dispersion in the solar sub-photosphere with localised magnetic field
concentrations of various types are presented. Time-distance diagrams of the
vertical velocity perturbation at the level corresponding to the visible solar
surface show that the magnetic field perturbs and scatters acoustic waves and
absorbs the acoustic power of the wave packet. For the weakly magnetised case
the effect of magnetic field is mainly thermodynamic, since the magnetic field
changes the temperature stratification. However, we observe the signature of
slow magnetoacoustic mode, propagating downwards, for the strong magnetic field
cases.

our sample that are faintest at short wavelengths, the accretion luminosity or
upper limit is measurable only when the image is binned over large wavelength
intervals. This method extends our sensivity to accretion rate down to ~1e-13

rate from excess Balmer continuum emission depends on the contrast between
excess continuum emission and the underlying photosphere, for objects with
earlier spectral types the upper limit on accretion rate is much higher.

uncertainty in accretion models, brown dwarf masses, and distance. The

within 15% of two previous measurements, despite large changes in the H-alpha

various electronic systems based on a pure electron picture (without the hole
concept). We argue that the Hall effect is the magnetic field induced symmetry
breaking of the charge carrier's spatial distribution. Due to the interaction
of the charge carriers and the ion lattice, there are two possible symmetry
breaking mechanisms which cause different signs of Hall coefficient in a Hall
material. The scenario provides an explicit explanation of the sign different
of the Hall coefficient in the N-type and P-type semiconductors, the sign
reversal induced by both temperature and magnetic field in different materials,
and the integer and fractional quantum Hall effect (QHE) in two-dimensional
electron gas (2DEG) of GaAs/AlGaN heterostructures.

  Physics 2008. 35 pages. v2: Added references",,,,"hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  These lecture notes are an introduction to toric geometry. Particular focus
is put on the description of toric local Calabi-Yau varieties, such as needed
in applications to the AdS/CFT correspondence in string theory. The point of
view taken in these lectures is mostly algebro-geometric but no prior knowledge
of algebraic geometry is assumed. After introducing the necessary mathematical
definitions, we discuss the construction of toric varieties as holomorphic
quotients. We discuss the resolution and deformation of toric Calabi-Yau
singularities. We also explain the gauged linear sigma-model (GLSM) Kahler
quotient construction.

Let F be a
distribution in R_+^{n(n-1)/2} with a coordinate for every pair i$ with 1 \le
i,j \le n. Then G_{F,p} is the distribution on graphs with n vertices obtained
by picking a random point X from F and defining a graph on n vertices whose
edges are pairs ij for which X_{ij} \le p. The standard Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi
model is the special case when F is uniform on the 0-1 unit cube. We examine
basic properties such as the connectivity threshold for quite general
distributions. We also consider cases where the X_{ij} are the edge weights in
some random instance of a combinatorial optimization problem. By choosing
suitable distributions, we can capture random graphs with interesting
properties such as triangle-free random graphs and weighted random graphs with
bounded total weight.

a simple k-uniform hypergraph with n vertices and maximum degree \Delta.
(Proper in that no edge is mono-coloured and simple in that two edges have
maximum intersection of size one). We give conditions on q,\Delta so that if
these conditions are satisfied, Glauber dynamics will converge in O(n\log n)
time from a random (improper) start. The interesting thing here is that for
k\geq 3 we can take q=o(\D).

demonstrate control of the spin current. This reversal is predicted by a spin
vector evolution equation in energy representation, which shows how the spin
and energy of individual atoms become correlated in the nearly undamped regime
of the experiments. The theory provides a simple physical description of the
spin current and explains both the large amplitude and the slow temporal
evolution of the data. Our results have applications in studying and
controlling fundamental spin interactions and spin currents in ultra-cold
