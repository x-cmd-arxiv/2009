in-flight, separated, then slowed down (from about 40 MeV/u) and implanted in

pre-main sequence Herbig Ae/Be stars have revealed the presence of organised
magnetic fields in the photospheres of a small fraction of these objects. To
date, 9 magnetic HAeBe stars have been detected, and those detections confirmed
by repeated observations. The morphology and variability of their Stokes V
signatures indicates that their magnetic fields have important dipole
components of kG strength, and that the dipole is stable on timescales ofat
least years. These magnetic stars exhibit a large range of stellar mass, from
about 2-13 solar masses, and diverse rotational properties, with vsini from a
few km/s to 200 km/s. Most magnetic HAeBe stars show approximately solar
abundances; they clearly do not generally exhibit the strong and systematic
peculiarities of the magnetic main sequence A and B type stars (the Ap/Bp
stars). The observed fractional bulk incidence of magnetic HAeBe stars is about
7%, a value compatible with the incidence of magnetic intermediate-mass stars
on the main sequence. This low incidence is at odds with formation scenarios
generally involving magnetically-mediated accretion. The similarily between the
magnetic properties of the pre-main sequence and main sequence

which implies that, to protect a network effectively, a few important nodes
should be allocated with more defense resources than the others. However, if
too many resources are allocated to the few important nodes, the numerous
less-important nodes will be less protected, which, when attacked all together,
still capable of causing a devastating damage. A natural question therefore is
how to efficiently distribute the limited defense resources among the network
nodes such that the network damage is minimized whatever attack strategy the
attacker may take. In this paper, taking into account the factor of attack
cost, we will revisit the problem of network security and search for efficient
network defense against the cost-based attacks. The study shows that, for a
general complex network, there will exist an optimal distribution of the
defense resources, with which the network is well protected from cost-based
attacks. Furthermore, it is found that the configuration of the optimal defense
is dependent on the network parameters. Specifically, network that has a larger
size, sparser connection and more heterogeneous structure will be more
benefited from the defense optimization.

et al.} have developed a tug-of-war model to describe the bidirectional
movement of the cargo (PNAS(2008) 105(12) P4609-4614). Through Monte Carlo
simulations, they discovered that the tug-of-war model exhibits several
qualitative different motility regimes, which depend on the precise value of
single motor parameters, and they suggested the sensitivity can be used by a
cell to regulate its cargo traffic. In the present paper, we carry out a
thorough analysis of the tug-of-war model. All the stable, i.e., biophysically
observable, steady states are obtained. Depending on several parameters, the
system exhibits either uni-, bi- or tristability. Based on the separating
boundary of the different stable states and the initial numbers of the
different motor species that are bound to the track, the steady state of the
cargo movement can be predicted, and consequently the steady state velocity can
be obtained. It is found that, the velocity, even the direction, of the cargo
movement change with the initial numbers of the motors which are bound to the
track and several other parameters.

debated in recent years. Does similar dilemma also exist in the evolution of
real networks such as biological networks? In this paper, we try to discuss
this issue by a simple model system, in which the topological structure of
networks is repeatedly modified and selected in order to make them have better
performance in dynamical processes. Interestingly, when the networks with
optimal performance deviate from the steady state networks under pure
mutations, we find the evolution behaves as a balance between mutation and
selection. Furthermore, when the timescales of mutations and dynamical
processes are comparable with each other, the steady state of evolution is
mainly determined by mutation. On the opposite side, when the timescale of
mutations is much longer than that of dynamical processes, selection dominates
the evolution and the steady-state networks turn to have much improved
performance and highly heterogeneous structures. Despite the simplicity of our
model system, this finding could give useful indication to detect the
underlying mechanisms that rein the evolution of real systems.

the chirality of filaments is still uncovered. We investigated how intermediate
filaments are related to their associated ARs, especially from the point of
view of magnetic helicity and the orientation of polarity inversion lines
(PILs). The chirality of filaments has been determined based on the
orientations of barbs observed in BBSO full-disk Halpha images taken during the
rising phase of solar cycle 23. The sign of magnetic helicity of ARs has been
determined using S/inverse-S shaped sigmoids from Yohkoh SXT images. As a
result, we have found a good correlation between the chirality of filaments and
the magnetic helicity sign of ARs. Among 45 filaments, 42 filaments have shown
the same sign as helicity sign of nearby ARs. It has been also confirmed that
the role of both the orientation and the relative direction of PILs to ARs in
determining the chirality of filaments is not significant, against a
theoretical prediction. These results suggest that the chirality of
intermediate filaments may originate from magnetic helicity of their associated
ARs.

(4-sulfonatophenyl) porphyrin and Fe(III) meso-Tetra (N-Methyl-4-Pyridyl)
porphyrin in water as starting materials. Long tubes of about one micron
diameter are formed with bunches of smaller tubes attached to it, as judged
from the analysis of HRTEM images. The PNTs formed by this method are found to
exhibit good visible emission at 669 nm on excitation at 432 nm whereas both
parent porphyrin monomers do not exhibit any fluorescence. This result
highlights the scope of PNTs as functional components in the design of
biofriendly devices in medical as well as nanophotonics applications.

disorder strength with the distance from its surface. A simple tight-binding
model is used to describe the system, in which the film is attached to two
metallic electrodes and the coupling of this film to the electrodes is
illustrated by the Newns-Anderson chemisorption theory. Quite interestingly we
observe that, in the smoothly varying disordered film current amplitude
increases with the increase of disorder strength in the strong disorder regime,
while it decreases in the weak disorder regime. This behavior is completely
opposite from a conventional disordered film, where current amplitude always
decreases with the increase of disorder strength.

classify precisely when the Bennequin bound is sharp for fibered knot types.
Finally we study rational unknots and show they are weakly Legendrian and
transversely simple.

all the main results of the paper remain true as originally stated.

complex dynamics under stochastic influences. Under a nonuniform hyperbolicity
or a nonuniform exponential dichotomy condition, the existence of random
pseudo-stable and pseudo-unstable manifolds for a class of \emph{random}
partial differential equations and \emph{stochastic} partial differential
equations is shown. Unlike the invariant manifold theory for stochastic
\emph{ordinary} differential equations, random norms are not used. The result
is then applied to a nonlinear stochastic partial differential equation with
linear multiplicative noise.

G:=<DX,-DL^{-1}X> where DX is X's Malliavin derivative and L^{-1} is the
inverse Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator. A lower- (resp. upper-) bound condition on
G is proved to imply a Gaussian-type lower (resp. upper) bound on the tail
P[X>z]. Bounds of other natures are also given. A key ingredient is the use of
Stein's lemma, including the explicit form of the solution of Stein's equation
relative to the function 1_{x>z}, and its relation to G. Another set of
comparable results is established, without the use of Stein's lemma, using
instead a formula for the density of a random variable based on G, recently
devised by the author and Ivan Nourdin. As an application, via a Mehler-type
formula for G, we show that the Brownian polymer in a Gaussian environment
which is white-noise in time and positively correlated in space has deviations
of Gaussian type and a fluctuation exponent \chi=1/2. We also show this
exponent remains 1/2 after a non-linear transformation of the polymer's
Hamiltonian.

energy fluctuations are investigated in the framework of a microcanonical model
with fragment degrees of freedom over a broad excitation energy range. As far
as fragment partitioning is approximately preserved, energy fluctuations are
found to be rather insensitive to both the way in which the freeze-out volume
is constrained and the trajectory followed by the system in the excitation
energy - freeze-out volume space. Due to hard-core repulsion, the freeze-out
volume is found to be populated un-uniformly, its highly depleted core giving
the source a bubble-like structure. The most probable localization of the
largest fragments in the freeze-out volume may be inferred experimentally from
their kinematic properties, largely dictated by Coulomb repulsion.
