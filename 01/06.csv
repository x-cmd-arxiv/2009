Arkani-Hamed et al. have proposed a model in which dark matter is charged under
a non-abelian ""dark"" gauge symmetry that is broken at ~ 1 GeV. In this paper,
we present a survey of concrete models realizing such a scenario, followed by a
largely model-independent study of collider phenomenology relevant to the
Tevatron and the LHC. We address some model building issues that are easily
surmounted to accommodate the astrophysics. While SUSY is not necessary, we
argue that it is theoretically well-motivated because the GeV scale is
automatically generated. Specifically, we propose a novel mechanism by which
mixed D-terms in the dark sector induce either SUSY breaking or a super-Higgs
mechanism precisely at a GeV. Furthermore, we elaborate on the original
proposal of Arkani-Hamed et al. in which the dark matter acts as a messenger of
gauge mediation to the dark sector. In our collider analysis we present
cross-sections for dominant production channels and lifetime estimates for
primary decay modes. We find that dark gauge bosons can be produced at the
Tevatron and the LHC, either through a process analogous to prompt photon
production or through a rare Z decay channel. Dark gauge bosons will decay back
to the SM via ""lepton jets"" which typically contain >2 and as many as 8
leptons, significantly improving their discovery potential. Since SUSY decays
from the MSSM will eventually cascade down to these lepton jets, the discovery
potential for direct electroweak-ino production may also be improved.
Exploiting the unique kinematics, we find that it is possible to reconstruct
the mass of the MSSM LSP. We also present decay channels with displaced
vertices and multiple leptons with partially correlated impact parameters.

reconstruction of the deflection angle power spectrum from weak lensing of
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and polarization observations. We
consider seven types of effects which are related to known instrumental
systematics: calibration, rotation, pointing, spin-flip, monopole leakage,
dipole leakage and quadrupole leakage. These effects can be characterized by 11
distortion fields. Each of these systematic effects can mimic the effective
projected matter power spectrum and hence contaminate the lensing
reconstruction. To demonstrate the effect of these instrumental systematics, we
consider two types of experiments, one with a detector noise level for
polarization of 9.6 uK-arcmin and FWHM of 8.0', typical of upcoming ground and
balloon-based CMB experiments, and a CMBPol-like instrument with a detector
noise level for polarization of 2.0 uK-arcmin and FWHM of 4.0', typical of
future space-based CMB experiments. For each systematics, we consider various
choices of coherence scale. Among all the 11 systematic parameters, rotation
and monopole leakage place the most stringent requirements, while quadrupole
leakage, pointing error, and calibration are among the least demanding. The
requirements from lensing extraction are about 1-2 orders of magnitude less
stringent than the requirements to measure the primordial B-modes with
inflationary energy scale of 1.0*10^{16} GeV. On the other hand the
requirements for lensing reconstruction are comparable or even more stringent
for some systematic parameters than the requirements to detect primordial
B-modes with inflationary scale E_i = 3.0*10^{16} GeV.

gravities. We first identify, in an ansatz appropriate to the study of those
solutions, the analog of the decoupling limit (DL) that has been used in the
Goldstone picture description. We show that the system of equations left over
in the DL has regular solutions featuring a Vainshtein-like recovery of
solutions of General Relativity (GR). Hence, the singularities found to arise
integrating the full nonlinear system of equations are not present in the DL,
despite the fact those singularities are usually thought to be due to a
negative energy mode also seen in this limit. Moreover, we show that the
scaling conjectured by Vainshtein at small radius is only a limiting case in an
infinite family of non singular solutions each showing a Vainshtein recovery of
GR solutions below the Vainshtein radius but a different common scaling at
small distances. This new scaling is shown to be associated with a zero mode of
the nonlinearities left over in the DL. We also show that, in the DL, this
scaling allows for a recovery of GR solutions even for potentials where the
original Vainshtein mechanism is not working. Our results imply either that the
DL misses some important features of nonlinear massive gravities or that
important features of the solutions of the full nonlinear theory have been
overlooked. They could also have interesting outcomes for the DGP model and

primordial and very metal-poor gas at high redshift. Aims: Grain surface and
gas phase formation of HD and H2 is investigated to assess the importance of
trace amounts of dust, 10^{-5}-10^{-3} Zo, in the production of HD and H2.
Methods: We consider carbonaceous and silicate grains and include both
physisorption and chemisorption, tunneling, and realistic grain surface
barriers. We find, for a collapsing gas cloud environment with coupled chemical
and thermal balance, that dust abundances as small as 10^{-5} solar lead to a
strong boost in the H2 formation rate due to surface reactions. As a result of
this enhancement in H2, HD is formed more efficiently in the gas phase through
the D+ + H2 reaction. Direct formation of HD on dust grains cannot compete well
with this gas phase process for dust temperatures below 150 K. We also derive
up-to-date analytic fitting formulae for the grain surface formation of H2 and
HD, including the different binding energies of H and D. Results: Grain surface
reactions are crucial to the availability of H2 and HD in very metal-poor
environments. Above metallicities of 10^{-5} solar, the grain surface route
dominates the formation of H2, which in turn, drives the formation of HD in the
gas phase. At dust temperatures above 150 K, laboratory experiments and
theoretical modelling suggest that H2 formation on grains is suppressed while
HD formation on grains is not.

A noncoherent
channel model is considered, where neither the transmitter nor the receiver is
cognizant of the realization of the path gains, but both are cognizant of their
statistics. It is shown that if the delay spread is large in the sense that the
variances of the path gains decay exponentially or slower, then capacity is
bounded in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). For such channels, capacity does
not tend to infinity as the SNR tends to infinity. In contrast, if the
variances of the path gains decay faster than exponentially, then capacity is
unbounded in the SNR. It is further demonstrated that if the number of paths is
finite, then at high SNR capacity grows double-logarithmically with the SNR,
and the capacity pre-loglog, defined as the limiting ratio of capacity to
log(log(SNR)) as SNR tends to infinity, is 1 irrespective of the number of
paths.

from cusps. This occurs when a cosmic string or a loop moves through a magnetic
field and develops an electric current. The charge carriers and the products of
their decay, including protons, photons and neutrinos, are emitted as a narrow
jets with opening angle $\theta \sim 1/\gamma_c$, where $\gamma_c$ is the
Lorentz factor of the cusp. The excitation of electric currents in strings
occurs mostly in clusters of galaxies, which are characterized by magnetic
fields $B \sim 10^{-6}$ G and a filling factor $f_B \sim 10^{-3}$.
  Two string parameters determine the emission of the particles: the symmetry
breaking scale $\eta$, which for successful applications should be of order
$10^9$--$10^{12}$ GeV, and the dimensionless parameter $i_c$, which determines
the maximum induced current as $J_{max} =i_c e \eta$ and the energy of emitted
charge carriers as $\epsilon_x \sim i_c \gamma_c \eta$, where $e$ is the
electric charge of a particle. For the parameters $\eta $ and $B$ mentioned

particle energy can be as high as $\gamma_c\eta \sim 10^{22}$ GeV. The diffuse
fluxes of UHE neutrinos are close to the cascade upper limit, and can be
detected by future neutrino observatories. The signatures of this model are:
very high energies of neutrinos, in excess of $10^{20}$ eV, correlation of

around a white dwarf would prove that such objects can survive the final stages
of stellar evolution and place constraints on the frequency of planetary
systems around their progenitors (with masses between 1.5 - 8 solar masses,
i.e., early B to mid F). This paper presents the results of a multi-epoch J
band common proper motion survey of 23 nearby equatorial and northern
hemisphere white dwarfs. We rule out the presence of any common proper motion
companions, with limiting masses determined from the completeness limit of each
observation, to 18 white dwarfs. For the remaining five targets, the motion of
the white dwarf is not sufficiently separated from the non-moving background
objects in each field. These targets require additional observations to
conclusively rule out the presence of any common proper motion companions. From
our completeness limits, we tentatively suggest that < 5% of white dwarfs have
substellar companions with effective temperatures > 500 K between projected
physical separations of 60 - 200 AU.

adding a second control that is proportional to the time-derivative of the

Lambda cold dark matter (LCDM) paradigm and a semi-analytic model of galaxy
formation to investigate the spin development of central supermassive black
holes (BHs) and its relation to the BH host galaxy properties. In order to
compute BH spins, we use the alpha-model of Shakura & Sunyaev and consider the
King et al. warped disc alignment criterion. The orientation of the accretion
disc is inferred from the angular momentum of the source of accreted material,
which bears a close relationship to the large-scale structure in the
simulation. We find that the final BH spin depends almost exclusively on the
accretion history and only weakly on the warped disc alignment. The main
mechanisms of BH spin-up are found to be gas cooling processes and disc
instabilities, a result that is only partially compatible with Monte-Carlo
models where the main spin-up mechanisms are major mergers and disc
instabilities; the latter results are reproduced when implementing randomly
oriented accretion discs in our model. Regarding the BH population, we find
that more massive BHs, which are hosted by massive ellipticals, have higher
spin values than less-massive BHs, hosted by spiral galaxies. We analyse
whether gas accretion rates and BH spins can be used as tracers of the radio
loudness of active galactic nuclei (AGN). We find that the current
observational indications of an increasing trend of radio-loud AGN fractions
with stellar and BH mass can be easily obtained when placing lower limits on
the BH spin, with a minimum influence from limits on the accretion rates; a
model with random accretion disc orientations is unable to reproduce this

metallicity gradients of early-type galaxies. Our sample of 51 early-type
galaxies encompasses a comprehensive mass range from dwarf to brightest cluster
galaxies. The metallicity gradients are measured out to one effective radius by
comparing nearly all of the Lick absorption-line indices to recent models of
single stellar populations. The relation shows very different behaviour at low
and high masses, with a sharp transition being seen at a mass of ~ 3.5 x 10^10
M_sun (velocity dispersion of ~140 km/s, M_B ~ -19). Low-mass galaxies form a
tight relation with mass, such that metallicity gradients become shallower with
decreasing mass and positive at the very low-mass end. Above the mass
transition point several massive galaxies have steeper gradients, but a clear
downturn is visible marked by a broad scatter. The results are interpreted in
comparison with competing model predictions. We find that an early star-forming
collapse could have acted as the main mechanism for the formation of low-mass
galaxies, with star formation efficiency increasing with galactic mass. The
high-mass downturn could be a consequence of merging and the observed larger
scatter a natural result of different merger properties. These results suggest
that galaxies above the mass threshold of ~ 3.5 x 10^10 M_sun might have formed
initially by mergers of gas-rich disc galaxies and then subsequently evolved
via dry merger events. The varying efficiency of the dissipative merger-induced
starburst and feedback processes have shaped the radial metallicity gradients
in these high-mass systems.

inflation in three main chapters. (I): The effective theory of inflation a la
Ginsburg-Landau (GL): the inflaton potential is a polynomial with universal
form making explicit the inflation energy scale M, the Planck mass and the
inflation e-folds number N ~ 60. The slow-roll expansion becomes a systematic
1/N expansion and the inflaton couplings are naturally small as powers of
(M/M_{Pl})^2. The spectral index (n_s - 1) and the ratio of tensor/scalar
fluctuations r are O(1/N), the running index is O(1/N^2). M ~ 0.7 10^{16} GeV
is completely determined by the scalar adiabatic fluctuations amplitude. (II):
A Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC) analysis of the CMB+LSS data (including
WMAP5) with our analytic theoretical results yields: a lower bound for r (new
inflation): r > 0.023 (95%CL), r > 0.046 (68%CL); the preferred inflation
potential is a double well, even function of the field yielding as most
probable values n_s ~ 0.964, r ~ 0.051. This value for r is within reach of
forthcoming CMB observations. Slow-roll inflation is generically preceded by a
short fast-roll stage which leads to a suppression of the CMB quadrupoles. MCMC
analysis of the WMAP+SDSS data shows that fast-roll fits the TT, TE and EE
modes well reproducing the quadrupole suppression and fixes the total number of
efolds of inflation to be N_{total} ~ 64. (III) Quantum loop corrections are
very small and controlled by powers of (H /M_{Pl})^2 ~ 10^{-9} which validates
the effective theory of inflation. We show how powerful is the GL theory of
inflation in predicting observables.

physical processes inside galaxies drive the changes in the SFRs in individual
galaxies that, taken together, produce the large decline in the global
star-formation rate density (SFRD) to redshifts since z~2. Many studies of the
SFR at intermediate redshifts have been made as a function of the integrated
stellar mass of galaxies but these did not use information on the internal
structural properties of the galaxies. In this paper we present a comparative
study of the dependence of SFRs on the average surface mass densities (SigmaM)
of galaxies of different morphological types up to z~1 using the zCOSMOS and
SDSS surveys. The main findings about the evolution of these relatively massive
galaxies are: 1) There is evidence that, for both SDSS ans zCOSMOS galaxies,
the mean specific SFR within a given population (either disk-dominated or
bulge-dominated) is independent of SigmaM; 2) The observed SSFR - SigmaM
step-function relation is due, at all investigated redshifts, to the changing
mix of disk-dominated and bulge-dominated galaxies as surface density increases
and the strong difference in the average SSFR between disks and bulges. We also
find a modest differential evolution in the size-mass relations of disk and
spheroid galaxies; 3) The shape of the median SSFR - SigmaM relation is
similar, but with median SSFR values that are about 5-6 times higher in zCOSMOS
galaxies than for SDSS, across the whole range of SigmaM, and in both spheroid
and disk galaxies. This increase matches that of the global SFRD of the
Universe as a whole, emphasizing that galaxies of all types are contributing,
proportionally, to the global increase in SFRD in the Universe back to these
redshifts (abridged).

galaxies in the rest-frame optical, and have transformed our understanding of
the early Universe. As the vast majority of K- or IRAC-selected galaxies is too
faint for spectroscopy, the interpretation of these surveys relies almost
exclusively on photometric redshifts determined from fitting templates to the
broad-band photometry. The best-achieved accuracy of these redshifts
Delta(z)/(1+z) ~ 0.06 at z>1.5, which is sufficient for determining the broad
characteristics of the galaxy population but not for measuring accurate
rest-frame colors, stellar population parameters, or the local galaxy density.
We have started a near-infrared imaging survey with the NEWFIRM camera on the
Kitt Peak 4m telescope to greatly improve the accuracy of photometric redshifts
in the range 1.5<z<3.5. The survey uses five medium-bandwidth filters, which
provide crude ""spectra"" over the wavelength range 1-1.8 micron for all objects
in the 27.6 x 27.6 arcmin NEWFIRM field. In this first paper, we illustrate the
technique by showing medium band NEWFIRM photometry of several galaxies at
1.7<z<2.7 from the near-infrared spectroscopic sample of Kriek et al. (2008).
The filters unambiguously pinpoint the location of the redshifted Balmer break
in these galaxies, enabling very accurate redshift measurements. The full
survey will provide similar data for ~8000 faint K-selected galaxies at z>1.5
in the COSMOS and AEGIS fields. The filter set also enables efficient selection
of exotic objects such as high redshift quasars, galaxies dominated by emission
lines, and very cool brown dwarfs; we show that late T and candidate ""Y"" dwarfs
could be identified using only two of the filters.

filament in the Cocoon Nebula (IC5146). We show the profile of the feature be
consistent with a two-component (polar + nonpolar) model for the ices, based on

first time 15 micron profiles in three widely separated dark clouds (Taurus,
Serpens and IC5146), and show that they are indistinguishable to within

the three clouds have little or no effect on the 15 micron profile. The
abundance of elemental oxygen in the ices appears to be a unifying factor,
displaying consistent behavior in the three clouds. We conclude that the ice
formation process is robust and uniformly efficient, notwithstanding
compositional variations arising from differences in how the O is distributed

10--300K. The afterglow photometry suggests an extinction law with R_V=4 and

modeling of the Swift/XRT X-ray spectrum confirms a large column density with
N(H) = 10^22.58 cm^-2. Remarkably, this molecular gas has extinction
properties, metallicity, and a CO/H2 ratio comparable to those of translucent

spectroscopic energy diagnostics of ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at
z > 0.15, classified optically as non-Seyferts. Based on the equivalent widths
of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission and the optical depths of silicate
dust absorption features, we searched for signatures of intrinsically luminous,
but optically elusive, buried AGNs in these optically non-Seyfert ULIRGs. We
then combined the results with those of non-Seyfert ULIRGs at z < 0.15 and
non-Seyfert galaxies with infrared luminosities L(IR) < 10^12Lsun. We found
that the energetic importance of buried AGNs clearly increases with galaxy
infrared luminosity, becoming suddenly discernible in ULIRGs with L(IR) >
10{12}Lsun. For ULIRGs with buried AGN signatures, a significant fraction of
infrared luminosities can be accounted for by detected buried AGN and
modestly-obscured (Av < 20 mag) starburst activity. The implied masses of
spheroidal stellar components in galaxies for which buried AGNs become
important roughly correspond to the value separating red massive and blue,
less-massive galaxies in the local universe. Our results may support the
widely-proposed AGN-feedback scenario as the origin of galaxy downsizing
phenomena, where galaxies with currently larger stellar masses previously had
higher AGN energetic contributions and star-formation-originating infrared
luminosities, and have finished their major star-formation more quickly, due to
stronger AGN feedback.

reported that the probability density for the inter-event time $\tau$ between

$\max(\rho,\sqrt\rho)$ that depends only on $\rho$ and $d$ and not on the

determining the magnitude of the model coefficient of the SGS models. We employ
the multiple relaxation times (MRT) formulation of LBM with a forcing term for
simulation of the grid-filtered dynamics of large-eddies. The dynamic procedure
is illustrated for use with the common Smagorinsky eddy-viscosity SGS model. We
also discuss proper sampling techniques or test-filters that facilitate
implementation of dynamic models in the LBM. For accommodating variable
resolutions, we employ locally refined grids in this framework. As examples, we
consider the canonical fully developed turbulent channel flow at two different
shear Reynolds numbers $Re_{*}$ of 180 and 395. The approach is able to
automatically and self-consistently compute the values of the Smagorinsky
coefficient, $C_S$. In particular, the computed value in the outer or bulk flow
region, where turbulence is generally more isotropic, is about 0.155 (or the
model coefficient $C=C_S^2=0.024$) which is in good agreement with prior data.
The model coefficient is also found to become smaller and approaches towards
zero near walls, reflecting the dampening of turbulent length scales near walls
and the computed turbulence statistics are also in good agreement with prior

temporal and spatial directions as well as among the spatial directions and
more interestingly, it displays the precise scaling symmetry required for
metric as well as the form fields. From the field theory point of view, it
describes a theory which respects th5Ae scaling symmetry, $t\to \lambda^{z_1}t,
x\to \lambda^{z_2}t, y\to \lambda y$, for $z_1\neq z_2$, as well as the
translational symmetry associated to both time and space directions, which
means we have found a non-rotational but Lifshitz-like fixed points from the
dual field theory point of view. We also discuss the minimum number of
generators required to see the appearance of such Lifshitz points. In 1+1
dimensional field theory, it is 3 and for 2+1 dimensional field theory, the
number is 4.

standard cosmological constant cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. In this
paper, we present updated constraints on early dark energy using geometrical
and dynamical probes. From WMAP five-year data, baryon acoustic oscillations
and type Ia supernovae luminosity distances, we obtain an upper limit of the
dark energy density at the last scattering surface (lss), $\Omega_{\rm

observational probes, such as measurements of the linear growth factors,
Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest (\lya), this limit improves
significantly and becomes $\Omega_{\rm EDE}(z_{\rm lss})<1.4\times10^{-3}$ (95%

Alcock-Paczy\'nski test using the 21cm neutral hydrogen line, on GRBs and on
the \lya forest, could constrain the behavior of the dark energy component and
distinguish at a high confidence level between early dark energy models and
pure $\Lambda$CDM. In this case, the constraints on the amount of early dark
energy at the last scattering surface improve by a factor ten, when compared to

stochastic hybrid systems is presented, within the framework of Generalized
Stochastic Hybrid Systems (GSHS). The FPK equation describes the time evolution
of the probability law of the hybrid state. Our derivation is based on the
concept of mean jump intensity, which is related to both the usual stochastic
intensity (in the case of spontaneous jumps) and the notion of probability
current (in the case of forced jumps). This work unifies all previously known
instances of the FPK equation for stochastic hybrid systems, and provides GSHS
practitioners with a tool to derive the correct evolution equation for the

Galactic halo and investigate the constraints on the IMF of the stellar
population that left these low-mass survivors of [Fe/H]<-2.5 and the chemical
evolution that they took part in. A high-mass IMF with the typical mass~10Msun
and the overwhelming contribution of low-mass members of binaries to the EMP
survivors are derived from the statistics of carbon-enriched EMP stars with and
without the enhancement of s-process elements (Komiya et al. 2007). We first
examine the analysis to confirm their results for various assumptions on the
mass-ratio distribution function. As compared with the uniform distribution,
the increase or decrease function of the mass ratio gives a higher- or
lower-mass IMF, and a lower-mass IMF results for the independent distribution
with the both members in the same IMF, but the derived ranges of typical mass
differ less than by a factor of two and overlap for the extreme cases.
Furthermore, we prove that the same constraints are placed on the IMF from the
surface density of EMP stars estimated from the surveys and the chemical
evolution consistent with the metal yields of theoretical supernova models. We
then apply the derived high-mass IMF with the binary contribution to show that
the observed MDF of EMP stars can be reproduced not only for the shape but also
for the number of EMP stars. In particular, the scarcity of stars below
[Fe/H]<-4 is naturally explained in terms of the hierarchical structure
formation, and there is no indication of significant changes in the IMF for the
EMP Population. The present study indicates that 3 HMP stars of [Fe/H]<-4 are
the primordial stars that were born as the low-mass members of binaries before
the host clouds were polluted by their own supernovae.

processes such as cell motility and mitosis. This action can be studied by
using motility assays in which the motion of cytoskeletal filaments over a
surface coated with motor proteins is tracked. In previous studies of
actin-myosin II systems, fast directional motion was observed, reflecting the
tendency of myosin II motors to propagate unidirectionally along actin
filaments. Here, we present a motility assay with actin bundles consisting of
short filamentous segments with randomly alternating polarities. These actin
tracks exhibit bidirectional motion with macroscopically large time intervals
(of the order of several seconds) between direction reversals. Analysis of this
bidirectional motion reveals that the characteristic reversal time,
$\tau_{rev}$, does not depend on the size of the moving bundle or on the number
of motors, $N$. This observation contradicts previous theoretical calculations
based on a two-state ratchet model [Badoual et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA,
vol. 99, p. 6696 (2002)], predicting an exponential increase of $\tau_{rev}$
with $N$. We present a modified version of this model that takes into account
the elastic energy due to the stretching of the actin track by the myosin II
motors. The new model yields a very good quantitative agreement with the
experimental results.

population around galaxies and in clusters of galaxies. The nature of the dark
population was not clear at that time, but the hypotheses of stellar as well as
of gaseous nature of the new population had serious difficulties. These
difficulties disappeared when non-baryonic nature of dark matter was suggested
in early 1980s. In addition to the presence of Dark Matter, recent observations
suggest the presence of Dark Energy, which together with Dark Matter and
ordinary baryonic matter makes the total matter/energy density of the Universe
equal to the critical cosmological density. There are various hypothesis as for
the nature of the dark matter particles, and generally some form of weakly
interactive massive particles (WIMPs) are strongly favored. Both Dark Matter
and Dark Energy are the greatest challenges for modern physics since their
nature is unknown.

Carlo samples from one distribution into samples from another. The method may
be developed analytically for certain special cases, and illuminate the idea
that it is a more precise form of the traditional Cornish-Fisher expansion. In
this manner the model risk of distributional risk may be assessed free of the
Monte Carlo noise associated with resampling. Examples are given of equations
for converting normal samples to Student t, and converting exponential to
hyperbolic, variance gamma and normal. In the case of the normal distribution,
the change of variables employed allows the sampling to take place to good
accuracy based on a single rational approximation over a very wide range of the
sample space. The avoidance of any branching statement is of use in optimal GPU
computations as it avoids the effect of {\it warp divergence}, and we give
examples of branch-free normal quantiles that offer performance improvements in
a GPU environment, while retaining the best precision characteristics of
well-known methods. We also offer models based on a low-probability of warp
divergence. Comparisons of new and old forms are made on the Nvidia Quadro

mode, the change-of-variables approach offers performance competitive with the
fastest existing scheme while substantially improving precision, and that in
double-precision mode, this approach offers the most GPU-optimal Gaussian
quantile yet, and without compromise on precision for Monte Carlo applications,

Cold Dark Matter cosmology, and in a scenario where S0s are assumed to be
former spirals stripped of gas. From an analysis of 127 early-type disk
galaxies (S0-Sa), we find a clear correlation between the scale parameters of
the bulge (r_eff) and the disk (h_R), a correlation which is difficult to
explain if these galaxies were formed in mergers of disk galaxies. However, the
stripping hypothesis, including quiescent star formation, is not sufficient to
explain the origin of S0s either, because it is not compatible with our finding
that S0s have a significantly smaller fraction of bars (46$\pm$6 %) than their
assumed progenitors, S0/a galaxies (93$\pm$5 %) or spirals (64-69 %). Our
conclusion is that even if a large majority of S0s were descendants of spiral
galaxies, bars and ovals must play an important role in their evolution. The
smaller fraction particularly of strong bars in S0 galaxies is compensated by a
larger fraction of ovals/lenses (97$\pm$2 % compared to 82-83 % in spirals),
many of which might be weakened bars. We also found massive disk-like bulges in
nine of the S0 galaxies, bulges which might have formed at an early gas-rich
stage of galaxy evolution.

errors in the centroid must be corrected, but the method may ultimately be able
to give accurate un-biased results when there is a high galaxy density with

question of uniqueness of empirical stratifications which is at the centre of

estimators. The quality of estimation is measured in terms of the rate function
related to the contrast, thus allowing to derive exponential risk bounds
invariant with respect to the detailed probabilistic structure of the model.
This approach works well for small or moderate samples and covers the case of a
misspecified parametric model. Another important feature of the presented
bounds is that they may be used in the case when the parametric set is
unbounded and non-compact. These bounds do not rely on the entropy or covering
numbers and can be easily computed. The most important statistical fact
resulting from the exponential bonds is a concentration inequality which claims
that minimum contrast estimators concentrate with a large probability on the
level set of the rate function. In typical situations, every such set is a
root-n neighborhood of the parameter of interest. We also show that the
obtained bounds can help for bounding the estimation risk, constructing
confidence sets for the underlying parameters. Our general results are
illustrated for the case of an i.i.d. sample. We also consider several popular
examples including least absolute deviation estimation and the problem of
estimating the location of a change point. What we obtain in these examples
slightly differs from the usual asymptotic results presented in statistical
literature. This difference is due to the unboundness of the parameter set and
a possible model misspecification.

negative refraction at dipole densities which are considerably smaller than
necessary to achieve a negative permeability. At the same time the absorption
gets minimized due to destructive quantum interference and the ratio of
negative refraction index to absorption becomes orders of magnitude larger than
in systems without coherent cross-coupling. The proposed scheme allows for a
fine-tuning of the refractive index. We derive a generalized expression for the

(mean size 4.5 nm) have been prepared. Previous transport investigations have
shown that Co particles induce spontaneous vortices below the superconducting
transition temperature (T$_{c}$) in zero external magnetic field. In this paper
we study in detail the influence of the Co volume franction and an external
magnetic field on the superconducting transition in such composites. The large
difference in T$_c$-reduction between the as-prepared and annealed samples can
be attributed to the different superconducting coherence lengths and the
resulting different diameters of the spontaneous vortices in these samples.
