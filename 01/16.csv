concentration of a passive scalar is investigated for non-helically forced
turbulence in the presence of rotation or a magnetic field. With rotation, the
Coriolis force causes a sideways deflection of the flux of mean concentration.
Within the magnetohydrodynamics approximation there is no analogous effect from
the magnetic field because the effects on the flow do not depend on the sign of
the field. rotation and magnetic fields tend to suppress turbulent transport,
but this suppression is weaker in the direction along the magnetic field.
Turbulent transport along the rotation axis is not strongly affected by
rotation, except on shorter length scales, i.e., when the scale of the
variation of the mean field becomes comparable with the scale of the
energy-carrying eddies. These results are discussed in the context of
anisotropic convective energy transport in the Sun.

Kolmogorov himself repeatedly claimed, the mathematical theory of probabilities
cannot be applied to physical, factual probabilistic situations because the
factual concept of probability is not defined : it is nowhere specified how to
construct, for a given physical random phenomenon, the specific numerical
distribution of relative frequencies of outcomes from the universe of
elementary events produced by that phenomenon, that constitutes the factual
probability law to be asserted on this universe; nor is it known what
significance to associate to the assertion of mere 'existence' of such a
factual probability law. An algorithm of semantic integration of the factual

then constructed. This algorithm, developed inside a general method of
relativized conceptualization, involves a quantification of the factual concept
of probability. These results, while solving Kolmogorov's aporia, fully
organize the general classical concept of probability, both syntactic and
factual. As for quantum mechanical 'probabilities', it comes out, surprisingly,

quantum mechanics seems to be confined (observationally and even in principle)

globular clusters (GCs) during their formation process. GCs beginning their
formation have an initial metallicity determined by the pre-enrichment of their
surrounding protocloud, but can also undergo internal self-enrichment during
formation. Stochastic variations in metallicity arise because of the finite
numbers of supernova. We construct an analytic formulation of the combined
effects of pre-enrichment and self-enrichment and use Monte Carlo models to
verify that the model accurately encapsulates the mean metallicity and
metallicity spread among real GCs. The predicted metallicity spread due to
self-enrichment alone, a robust prediction of the model, is much smaller than
the observed spread among real GCs. This result rules out self-enrichment as a
significant contributor to the metal content in most GCs, leaving
pre-enrichment as the viable alternative. Self-enrichment can, however, be
important for clusters with masses well above 10^6 Msun, which are massive
enough to hold in a significant fraction of their SN ejecta even without any
external pressure confinement. This transition point corresponds well to the
mass at which a mass-metallicity relationship (""blue tilt"") appears in the
metal-poor cluster sequence in many large galaxies. We therefore suggest that
self-enrichment is the primary driver for the mass-metallicity relation. Other
predictions from our model are that the cluster-to-cluster metallicity spread
decreases amongst the highest mass clusters; and that the red GC sequence
should also display a more modest mass-metallicity trend if it can be traced to
similarly high mass.

separating the liquid core from the solid crust of neutron stars are
systematically studied using a modified Gogny (MDI) and 47 popular Skyrme
interactions within well established dynamical and thermodynamical methods. It
is shown that the widely used parabolic approximation to the full Equation of
State (EOS) of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter may lead to huge errors in
estimating the \rho_{t} and P_{t}, especially for stiffer symmetry energy
functionals $E_{sym}(\rho)$. The \rho_{t} and P_{t} decrease roughly linearly
with the increasing slope parameter $L$ of the $E_{sym}(\rho)$ using the full
EOS within both methods. It is also shown that the thickness, fractional mass
and moment of inertia of neutron star crust are all very sensitive to the
parameter $L$ through the $\rho_{t}$. Moreover, it is shown that the
$E_{sym}(\rho)$ constrained in the same sub-saturation density range as the
neutron star crust by the isospin diffusion data in heavy-ion collisions at
intermediate energies limits the transition density and pressure to 0.040$
fm^-3}< \rho_{t} < 0.065$ fm^-3 and 0.01 MeV/fm^3 < P_{t} < 0.26$ MeV/fm^3,
respectively. These constrained values for the transition density and pressure
are significantly lower than their fiducial values currently used in the
literature. Furthermore, the mass-radius relation and several other properties
closely related to the neutron star crust are studied by using the MDI
interaction. It is found that the newly constrained $\rho_t$ and $P_t$ together
with the earlier estimate of $\Delta I/I>0.014$ for the crustal fraction of the
moment of inertia of the Vela pulsar impose a stringent constraint of R>=
4.7+4.0M/M_sun km for the radius $R$ and mass $M$ of neutron stars.

characteristic of the overdoped regime undergoes a reconstruction caused by the
onset of some order which breaks translational symmetry. Here we consider the
possibility that this order is ""stripe"" order, a form of charge / spin

In these materials, the onset of stripe order is indeed the cause of
Fermi-surface reconstruction. We identify the critical doping where this

Such sets of sequences may be singled out almost surely with respect to certain

and put an arbitrary prior on the parameter. The Bayesian measure is the
expectation of the parameterized measure with respect to the prior. It appears
that a modified Shannon-Fano code for any computable Bayesian measure, which we
call the Bayesian code, is superuniversal on a set of parameterized
measure-almost all sequences for prior-almost every parameter. According to
this result, in the typical setting of mathematical statistics no computable
code enjoys redundancy which is ultimately much less than that of the Bayesian
code. Thus we introduce another characteristic of computable codes: The
catch-up time is the length of data for which the code length drops below the
Kolmogorov complexity plus the prescribed margin. Some codes may have smaller
catch-up times than Bayesian codes.

cooling age deduced. Results are compared with the well known parameters of the
visible primary, which allows us to determine a lower limit for the cooling age
difference of both WDs. Most of the ten systems in our sample have a minimum
age difference of not larger than 0.5Gyr and their small orbital separation is
highly suggestive of at least one unstable mass transfer phase. However, a
stable first mass transfer phase is feasible as the age difference is less then

achieve the maximum possible throughput in ad hoc wireless networks. However,
these algorithms assume an idealized continuous-time CSMA protocol where
collisions can never occur. In addition, simulation results indicate that the
delay performance of these algorithms can be quite bad. On the other hand,
although some simple heuristics (such as distributed approximations of greedy
maximal scheduling) can yield much better delay performance for a large set of
arrival rates, they may only achieve a fraction of the capacity region in
general. In this paper, we propose a discrete-time version of the CSMA
algorithm. Central to our results is a discrete-time distributed randomized
algorithm which is based on a generalization of the so-called Glauber dynamics
from statistical physics, where multiple links are allowed to update their
states in a single time slot. The algorithm generates collision-free
transmission schedules while explicitly taking collisions into account during
the control phase of the protocol, thus relaxing the perfect CSMA assumption.
More importantly, the algorithm allows us to incorporate mechanisms which lead
to very good delay performance while retaining the throughput-optimality
property. It also resolves the hidden and exposed terminal problems associated
with wireless networks.

contour, we show that the motion of the string is described by the classical
equations of motion with a stochastic boundary condition on the stretched
horizon. The form of the stochastic boundary condition is consistent with the
dissipation on this surface and is found by integrating out the fluctuations
inside of the stretched horizon. Solving the equations of motion for the
fluctuating string we determine the full frequency dependence of the random
force on the boundary quark and show that it is consistent with the frequency
dependent dissipation. We show further that the stochastic motion reproduces
the bulk to bulk two point functions of the Kruskal formalism. These turn out
to be related to the usual retarded bulk to bulk propagator by KMS relations.
Finally we analyze the stochastic equations and give a bulk picture of the
random boundary force as a flip-flopping trailing string solution. The basic
formalism can be applied to the fluctuations of gravitons, dilatons, and other
fields.

have evolved off the stellar main sequence long ago. There are two known
processes that can create these objects: direct stellar collisions and binary
evolution. However, the relative importance of these processes has remained
unclear. In particular, the total number of blue stragglers found in a given
cluster does not seem to correlate with the predicted collision rate, providing
indirect support for the binary-evolution model. Yet the radial distributions
of blue stragglers in many clusters are bimodal, with a dominant central peak:
this has been interpreted as an indication that collisions do dominate blue
straggler production, at least in the high-density cluster cores. Here we
report that there is a clear, but sublinear, correlation between the number of
blue stragglers found in a cluster core and the total stellar mass contained
within it. From this we conclude that most blue stragglers, even those found in

themselves have been affected by dynamical encounters. This may be the key to
reconciling all of the seemingly conflicting results found to date.

Fourier analysis method. The ellipse fitting method was found to be more
efficient in detecting bars in spiral galaxies. The fraction of barred galaxies
turned out to be 45%. A bar was found in 29% of the lenticular galaxies, in 55%
and 54% of the early- and late-type spirals, respectively. The bar length
(normalised by the galaxy size) of late-type spirals is shorter than in
early-type or lenticular ones. A correlation between the bar length and galaxy
size was found with longer bars hosted by larger galaxies. The bars of the
lenticular galaxies are weaker than those in spirals. Moreover, the unimodal
distribution of the bar strength found for all the galaxy types argues against
a quick transition between the barred and unbarred statues. There is no
difference between the local galaxy density of barred and unbarred galaxies.
Besides, neither the length nor strength of the bars are correlated with the
local density of the galaxy neighbourhoods. In contrast, a statistical
significant difference between the central light concentration and colour of
barred and unbarred galaxies was found. Bars are mostly located in less
concentrated and bluer galaxies. These results indicate that the properties of
bars are strongly related to those of their host galaxies, but do not depend on
the local environment.

law established parallels between biological and physical processes, and
language, laying the groundwork for a complex systems perspective on human
communication. More recent research has also identified scaling regularities in
the dynamics underlying the successive occurrences of events, suggesting the
possibility of similar findings for language as well.
  Methodology/Principal Findings: By considering frequent words in USENET
discussion groups and in disparate databases where the language has different
levels of formality, here we show that the distributions of distances between
successive occurrences of the same word display bursty deviations from a
Poisson process and are well characterized by a stretched exponential (Weibull)
scaling. The extent of this deviation depends strongly on semantic type -- a
measure of the logicality of each word -- and less strongly on frequency. We
develop a generative model of this behavior that fully determines the dynamics
of word usage.
  Conclusions/Significance: Recurrence patterns of words are well described by
a stretched exponential distribution of recurrence times, an empirical scaling
that cannot be anticipated from Zipf's law. Because the use of words provides a
uniquely precise and powerful lens on human thought and activity, our findings
also have implications for other overt manifestations of collective human
dynamics.

duration of their starburst events using a uniform and consistent approach. We
find that the bursts range from ~200 - ~400 Myr in duration resolving the
tension between the shorter timescales often derived observationally with the
longer timescales derived from dynamical arguments. If these three starbursts
are typical of starbursts in dwarf galaxies, then the short timescales (3 - 10
Myr) associated with starbursts in previous studies are best understood as
""flickering"" events which are simply small components of the larger starburst.
In this sample of three nearby dwarfs, the bursts are not localized events. All
three systems show bursting levels of star formation in regions of both high
and low stellar density. The enhanced star formation moves around the galaxy
during the bursts and covers a large fraction of the area of the galaxy. These
massive, long duration bursts can significantly affect the structure, dynamics,

first chapters cover basic concepts, giving results on adjoint representation,
closed subgroups, bi-invariant metrics, Killing forms and splitting in simple

together with adjoint action and foliations, mostly concerning the Weyl group,
normal slices and Dynkin diagrams. A special focus is given to maximal tori and
roots of compact Lie groups, exploring its connection with isoparametric
submanifolds and polar actions. Furthermore, in the last chapter, a survey on
recent research results on s.r.f.s. is given.

attracted and trapped to one of the pulselike stationary solutions. While the
viscosity has been neglected in most of previous studies, our study suggests
that the precise treatment of the viscosity is necessary to discuss the

occurrences of variables in the production rules according to their

which is obtained by transposing (and generalizing) the safety condition to the
setting of the simply-typed lambda calculus. In contrast to the original
definition of safety, our calculus does not constrain types (to be
homogeneous). We show that in the safe lambda calculus, there is no need to
rename bound variables when performing substitution, as variable capture is
guaranteed not to happen. We also propose an adequate notion of beta-reduction
that preserves safety. In the same vein as Schwichtenberg's 1976
characterization of the simply-typed lambda calculus, we show that the numeric
functions representable in the safe lambda calculus are exactly the
multivariate polynomials; thus conditional is not definable. We also give a
characterization of representable word functions. We then study the complexity
of deciding beta-eta equality of two safe simply-typed terms and show that this
problem is PSPACE-hard. Finally we give a game-semantic analysis of safety: We
show that safe terms are denoted by `P-incrementally justified strategies'.
Consequently pointers in the game semantics of safe lambda-terms are only
necessary from order 4 onwards.

with the aim of setting up onboard the International Space Station (ISS)
several highly stable atomic clocks with a microwave communication link (MWL).
The specifications of the MWL are to perform ground to space time and frequency
comparisons with a stability of 0.3 ps at one ISS pass and 7 ps at one day.
  The raw measurements of the ACES MWL need to be related to the scientific
products considering all terms greater than 0.1 ps when maximized. In fact, the
mission aims at extracting physical variables (scientific products) from the
code and phase measurements on ground and in space and auxiliary data.
  To this purpose we have developed the complete model of the time transfer at
the required 0.1 ps level. We have then developed in parallel two softwares, a
program to simulate the raw MWL measurements and an algorithm which provides
the scientific products from the raw measurements. We provide some details on
the software and the tests, considering different cases and realistic situation
using real ISS orbitography data and MWL measurement noise from the MWL
engineering model.
  The phase ambiguity removal of carrier phase measurements is performed by the
algorithm and its success strongly depends on the noise of the observables. We
have investigated the statistics of cycle slips which appear during this
operation using experimental data obtained from the tests of the MWL
engineering model. We present two novel methods which allow the reduction of
the cycle slip probabilities by a factor greater than 5 compared to the

discrete-time synchronization algorithms on the circle are deduced by analogy.
It is shown how they are connected to Kuramoto and Vicsek models from the

are proposed to illustrate several other possible behaviors. Finally, new

modes interact strongly with electrons and ions. One such interaction,
resulting in potential inversion, causes localization of electron pairs on
deuterons. Thus, we have attraction of D+ D- pairs and strong screening of the
nuclear repulsion due to these local electron pairs (local charged bosons:
acronym, lochons). This attraction and strong coupling permits low-energy
deuterons to approach close enough to alter the standard equations used to

conclusion that the WAP favors a negative value for the cosmological constant,
$\Lambda$, in contradiction to the result of astronomical observations. The
viability of applying the WAP to string theory then requires that either there

(nonequilibrium soft mode heating) is considered. It is shown that this effect
must be most clearly pronounced far from the resonance (\omega_0 << \omega_sm),
rather than for the external field frequency \omega_0 close to the soft mode
frequency \omega_sm. The effective permittivity as a function of the
high-frequency field amplitude is calculated using the phenomenological
approach and within the microscopic theory based on the simple model of a
displacement-type ferroelectric.

subsequent ringdown. We find that the phase and amplitude agree within each

is better than $10^{-3}$ for binary masses above $60 M_{\odot}$ with respect to
the Enhanced LIGO detector noise curve, and for masses above $180 M_{\odot}$

nebula showing both solid state and atomic gas signatures. Strong
low-excitation atomic fine structure lines such as $ 26.0 \mu$m [\ion{Fe}{2}]
and $ 34.8 \mu$m [\ion{Si}{2}], indicate, for the first time, the presence of a
PDR in this object class. While the physics and chemistry of the low-excitation
gas appears to be dominated by photodissociation, a possible contribution due
to shocks can be inferred from the evidence of gas phase Fe abundance
enhancement. The presence of amorphous silicates, inferred from the observed
characteristic broad feature at $10 \mu$m located in the inner nebula, suggests
that dust has formed during the LBV outburst. This is in contrast with the
detection of crystalline dust in other probably more evolved Galactic LBVs,
which is similar to the crystalline dust observed in red supergiants. This has
been considered to be evidence of dust production during evolutionary phases
prior to the outburst.

particle density in these string-theory motivated setups. In particular, we
find a broadening of the vector meson peaks in the relevant spectral function
at finite density. However, we do not observe a movement of the resonances to
lower frequencies.
  Moreover, we analyze the effects of strong coupling on heavy meson diffusion
in medium. To do so, we make use of an effective model with dipole interaction,
which is valid for heavy quarks at arbitrary coupling strength. We calculate
the momentum broadening -- normalized to the in-medium mass shift -- and
compare the large 't Hooft coupling AdS/CFT result with a perturbative result

redshift, where the main assembly and star formation occurred, and report on
the first cosmological simulations that reveal clumpy disks consistent with our
analysis. The evolution is governed by the interplay between smooth and clumpy
cold streams, disk instability, and bulge formation. Intense, relatively smooth
streams maintain an unstable dense gas-rich disk. Instability with high
turbulence and giant clumps, each a few percent of the disk mass, is
self-regulated by gravitational interactions within the disk. The clumps
migrate into a bulge in ~10 dynamical times, or ~0.5Gyr. The cosmological
streams replenish the draining disk and prolong the clumpy phase to several
Gigayears in a steady state, with comparable masses in disk, bulge, and dark
matter within the disk radius. The clumps form stars in dense subclumps
following the overall accretion rate, ~100 Msun/yr, and each clump converts
into stars in ~0.5 Gyr. While the clumps coalesce dissipatively to a compact
bulge, the star-forming disk is extended because the incoming streams keep the
outer disk dense and susceptible to instability and because of angular momentum
transport. Passive spheroid-dominated galaxies form when the streams are more
clumpy: the external clumps merge into a massive bulge and stir up disk
turbulence that stabilize the disk and suppress in situ clump and star
formation. We predict a bimodality in galaxy type by z~3, involving giant-clump
star-forming disks and spheroid-dominated galaxies of suppressed star
formation. After z~1, the disks tend to be stabilized by the dominant stellar
disks and bulges. Most of the high-z massive disks are likely to end up as
today's early-type galaxies.

a balancing of fermionic and bosonic contributions in the RG flow induces such

flavors. The fermion-boson balancing can still be demonstrated within a model
system with a small fractional flavor number in the symmetry-broken regime. The
UV behavior of this small-N_f system is controlled by a conformal Higgs
expectation value. The system has only two physical parameters, implying that
the Higgs mass can be predicted. It also naturally explains the heavy mass of
the top quark, since there are no RG trajectories connecting the UV fixed point

analysis of pulse propagation based on the second order wave equation shows
that use of $n_s$ results in a wave vector \emph{different} to that actually

used as a rudimentary data set. These data are then generalised to all
temperatures and humidities by invoking the property of multiplicative
separability, as well as by converting established relationships in terms of
constant humidity at fixed temperature, to alternatives in terms of a
calculated water loss. In this way a formulation which is a series of very
simple, first order, ordinary differential equations is devised. The model is
extended to include a variety of Glossina species using their relative surface
areas, their relative pupal and puparial loss rates and their different 4th
instar excretions. The resulting computational model calculates total, pupal
water loss, consequent mortality and emergence. Remaining fat reserves are a
more tenuous result.
  The model suggests that, while conventional wisdom is often correct in
dismissing variability in transpiration-related pupal mortality as
insignificant, the effects of transpiration can be profound under adverse
conditions and for some species, in general. The model demonstrates how two
gender effects, the more significant one at the drier extremes of tsetse fly
habitat, might arise. The agreement between calculated and measured critical
water losses suggests very little difference in the behaviour of the different
species.

which such a rigorous treatment of the dust grain dynamics has been combined
with a self-consistent calculation of the thermal and ionisation structures

significant role in the shock dynamics. At high densities, the ionisation
fraction is sufficiently low that dust grains are important charge and current
carriers and, thus, determine the shock structure. We find that the magnetic

plane. This is most pronounced for single-sized grains and small angles of the
shock normal with the magnetic field. Our results are similar to previous
studies of steady C-type shocks showing that our method is efficient, rigorous

an on-the-fly (OTF) or a raster-mapping mode depending on the capabilities of
the telescope and the instrument. The observing efficiency can be increased by
combining several source-point integrations with a common reference
measurement. This is implemented at many telescopes, but a thorough
investigation of the optimum calibration of the modes and the best way of
performing these observations is still lacking.
  We use knowledge of the instrumental stability obtained by an Allan variance
measurement to derive a mathematical formalism for optimizing the setup of
mapping observations. Special attention has to be paid to minimizing of the
impact of correlated noise introduced by the common OFF integrations and to the
correction of instrumental drifts. Both aspects can be covered using a
calibration scheme that interpolates between two OFF measurements and an
appropriate OFF integration time.
  The total uncertainty of the calibrated data consisting of radiometric noise
and drift noise can be minimized by adjusting the source integration time and
the number of data points observed between two OFF measurements. It turns out
that OTF observations are very robust. They provide a low relative noise, even
if their setup deviates considerably from the optimum. Fast data readouts are
often essential to minimize the drift contributions. In particular, continuum
measurements may be easily spoiled by instrumental drifts. The main drawback of
the described mapping modes is the limited use of the measured data at
different spatial or spectroscopic resolutions obtained by additional
rebinning.

from quark matter to the high temperature superconductors. A wide class of

manner. This is the case, as both the intra-species and the inter-species
interactions are treated on equally rigorous footing, which is accomplished via
the introduction of a new quantum index attached to the fermions. The index is
consistent with known fermionic physics, and allows for heretofore unaccounted

Based on these solutions, we show that, for equivalent spin up and down
fermions, the Fermi occupation factor (per spin) equals 1/2 deep in the Fermi
sea. This constitutes a unique experimental prediction of the theory, both for
the normal and superfluid states. Interestingly, this result, obtained in the
thermodynamic limit, is consistent with Fermi occupation factor (in-)equalities

the superposition of elementary processes with varying activation energies. We
show that it is possible to obtain the kinetic parameters of these processes
from differential scanning calorimetry experiments. The transformation rate is
predicted for the transient decay when an isotherm is reached and for the
relaxation threshold detected in partially relaxed samples. Good agreement is
obtained with experiment if the individual components transform through
first-order kinetics, but inconsistencies arise for second-order components.
Our analysis, that improves the classical treatment by Gibbs et al.[1], allows
the activation energies and the pre-exponential rate constants to be extracted
independently. When applied to a-Si, we conclude that the pre-exponential rate
constant is far from constant. The kinetic parameters obtained from DSC are
used to analyze the relaxation of a-Si in pulsed laser experiments and to
discuss the relationship between structural relaxation and crystallization.

concepts of computational statistical physics, which I felt would be accessible
to the very cross-cultural audience at the school.
  I started with a discussion of sampling, which lies at the heart of the Monte
Carlo approach. I specially emphasized the concept of perfect sampling, which
offers a synthesis of the traditional direct and Markov-chain sampling
approaches. The second lecture concerned classical hard-sphere systems, which
illuminate the foundations of statistical mechanics, but also illustrate the
curious difficulties that beset even the most recent simulations. I then moved
on, in the third lecture, to quantum Monte Carlo methods, that underly much of
the modern work in bosonic systems. Quantum Monte Carlo is an intricate
subject. Yet one can discuss it in simplified settings (the single-particle
free propagator, ideal bosons) and write direct-sampling algorithms for the two
cases in two or three dozen lines of code only. These idealized algorithms
illustrate many of the crucial ideas in the field. The fourth lecture attempted
to illustrate aspects of the unity of physics as realized in the Ising model
simulations of recent years.
  More details on what I discussed in Les Houches, and wrote up (and somewhat
rearranged) here, can be found in my book, ""Statistical Mechanics: Algorithms
and Computations"", as well as in recent papers. Computer programs are available

which couples molecular motion to a mesoscopic fluid solvent. Thousands of
events of long polymers (up to 8000 monomers) are monitored as they pass
through nanopores. Comparison between the different pore sizes shows that wide
pores can host a larger number of multiple biopolymer segments, as compared to
smaller pores. The simulations provide clear evidence of folding quantization
in the translocation process as the biopolymers undertake multi-folded
configurations, characterized by a well-defined integer number of folds.
Accordingly, the translocation time is no longer represented by a
single-exponent power law dependence on the length, as it is the case for
single-file translocation through narrow pores. The folding quantization
increases with the biopolymer length, while the rate of translocated beads at
each time step is linearly correlated to the number of resident beads in the
pore. Finally, analysis of the statistics over the translocation work unravels
the importance of the hydrodynamic interactions in the process.

of the status of the thermal model description of hadron production at high
energy. Within this framework an excellent account is achieved of all data for
hadrons built of (u,d,s) valence quarks using temperature, baryo-chemical
potential and volume as thermal parameters. The large charm quark mass brings
in a new (non-thermal) scale which is explicitely taken into account by fixing
the total number of charm quarks produced in the collision. Emphasis is placed
on the description of the physical basis for the resulting statistical
hadronization model. We discuss the evidence for statistical hadronization of
charmonia by analysis of recent data from the SPS and RHIC accelerators.
Furthermore we discuss an extension of this model towards lower beam energies
and develop arguments about the prospects to observe medium modifications of
open and hidden charm hadrons. With the imminent start of the LHC accelerator
at CERN, exciting prospects for charmonium production studies at the very high
energy frontier come into reach. We present arguments that, at such energies,
charmonium production becomes a fingerprint of deconfinement: even if no
charmonia survive in the quark-gluon plasma, statistical hadronization at the
QCD phase boundary of the many tens of charm quarks expected in a single
central Pb-Pb collision could lead to an enhanced, rather than suppressed
production probability when compared to results for nucleon-nucleon reactions
scaled by the number of hard collisions in the Pb-Pb system.

"0901.2507","Omar Benhar","Nicola Farina","Weak Response of Nuclear Matter",,,,,"nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The quantitative understanding of neutrino interactions with nuclei and
nuclear matter is needed to the study of many different problems. In the
astrophysics environment, neutrino-nucleon and neutrino-nucleus reaction rates
are used as inputs in the simulations of phenomena like supernov$\ae$
explosions and neutron star cooling. In the field of neutrino physics, the
quantitative knowledge of neutrino-nucleus cross-section is critical to reduce
the systematic uncertainty of the long baseline oscillation experiments.
  It is important to realize that, while neutrinos interacting in stellar
matter typically have energies of the order of few MeV, the energies involved
in long baseline oscillations experiments are much larger. For example, K2K
experiment takes data in the region $E_{\nu} =0.5-3$ GeV.
  In this thesis, we describe how nuclear many-body theory provide a scheme
allowing for a consistent treatment of neutrino-nucleus interactions at both
high and low energies. We will show our predictions of the neutrino-nucleus
cross section in the high energy regime and the results of our calculations for
the nuclear matter weak response in the low energy regime.

twins (HIP 56948, HIP 79672, and HIP 100963) as well as for the Sun (Moon;
reference standard), with an intention of (1) quantitatively discussing the
relative-to-Sun similarities based on the precisely established differential
parameters and (2) investigating the reason causing the Li abundance
differences despite their similarities. It was concluded that HIP 56948 most
resembles the Sun in every respect including the Li abundance (though not
perfectly similar) among the three and deserves the name of ""closest-ever solar
twin"", while HIP 79672 and HIP 100963 have somewhat higher effective
temperature and appreciably higher surface Li composition. While there is an
indication of Li being rotation-dependent because the projected rotation in HIP
56948 (and the Sun) is slightly lower than the other two, the rotational
difference alone does not seem to be so large as to efficiently produce the
marked change in Li. Rather, this may be more likely to be attributed (at least
partly) to the slight difference in T_eff via some T_eff-sensitive
Li-controlling mechanism. Since the abundance of beryllium was found to be
essentially solar for all stars irrespective of Li, any physical process
causing the Li diversity should work only on Li without affecting Be.

When a {4}-string is stretched beyond a critical length, it decays into a
{2}-string by gluon pair creation. When a {5}-string is stretched, it first
decays into a {3}-string, which eventually breaks completely. The energy of the
screened charges at the ends of a string is well described by a
phenomenological constituent gluon model.
