mechanism. The crossover events are not evenly distributed along the natural
chromosomes. Monte Carlo simulations revealed that frequency of recombinations
decides about the strategy of chromosomes' and genomes' evolution. In large
panmictic populations, under high recombination rate the Darwinian purifying
selection operates keeping the fraction of defective genes at the relatively
low level. In small populations and under low recombination rate the strategy
of complementing haplotypes seems to be more advantageous. Switching between
the two strategies has a character of phase transition - it depends on
inbreeding coefficient and crossover rate. The critical recombination rate
depends also on the size of chromosome. It is also possible, that in one genome
some chromosomes could be under complementing while some other under purifying
selection. Such situation stabilizes genome evolution and reproduction
strategy. It seems that this phenomenon can be responsible for the positive
correlation between kinship and fecundity, recently found in the Islander
population. When large population is forced to enter the complementing
strategy, the phenomenon of sympatric speciation is observed.

find that while a density-morphology relation is present for the sample, it
cannot solely explain the observed suppression of SF in galaxies in
high-density environments. We also find that early-type and late-type galaxies
exhibit distinct radial star formation rate (SFR) distributions, with
early-types having a SFR distribution that extends further relative to the
galaxy scale length, compared to late-types at all densities. We find that a
suppression of SF in the highest density environments is found in the highest
star forming galaxies for both galaxy types. This suppression occurs in the
innermost regions in late-types (r <= 0.125 Petrosian radii), and further out
in radius in early-types (0.125< r <= 0.25 Petrosian radii). When the full
sample is considered no clear suppression of SF is detected, indicating that
the environmental trends are driven only by the highest SF galaxies. We
demonstrate that the density-morphology relation alone cannot account for the
suppression of SF in the highest density environments. This points to an
environmentally-governed evolutionary mechanism that affects the SF in the
innermost regions in both early and late-type galaxies. We suggest that this is
a natural consequence of the ""downsizing"" of SF in galaxies.

In the case of heavier core blocks, SCFT predicts the critical micelle
concentration less well due to inaccuracies in the modelling of the bulk
chemical potential. Overall, we find that SCFT gives a very good description of
spherical micelle formation and hence demonstrate that a mean-field,
equilibrium approach is valid for these systems.

planetesimals. However, vortex dynamics is commonly studied in
non-self-gravitating discs. The main goal here is to examine the effects of
disc self-gravity on vortex dynamics. For this purpose, we employ the 2D
self-gravitating shearing sheet approximation. A simple cooling law with a
constant cooling time is adopted, such that the disc settles down into a
quasi-steady gravitoturbulent state. In this state, vortices appear as
transient structures undergoing recurring phases of formation, growth to sizes
comparable to a local Jeans scale and eventual shearing and destruction due to
the combined effects of self-gravity and background Keplerian shear. Each phase
typically lasts about 2 orbital periods or less. As a result, in
self-gravitating discs the overall dynamical picture of vortex evolution is
irregular consisting of many transient vortices at different evolutionary
stages and, therefore, with various sizes up to the local Jeans scale. Vortices
generate density waves during evolution, which turn into shocks. Therefore, the
dynamics of density waves and vortices are coupled implying that, in general,
one should consider both vortex and spiral density wave modes in order to get a
proper understanding of self-gravitating disc dynamics. Our results suggest
that given such an irregular and rapidly varying character of vortex evolution
in self-gravitating discs, it may be difficult for such vortices to effectively
trap dust particles. Further study of the behaviour of dust particles embedded
in a self-gravitating gaseous disc is, however, required to strengthen this
conclusion.

provide critical constraints on theories of coronal heating. Unfortunately, the
complexity of the solar atmosphere, observational uncertainties, and the
limitations of current atomic calculations, particularly those for Fe, all
conspire to make this task very difficult. A critical assessment of plasma
diagnostics in the corona is essential to making progress on the coronal
heating problem. In this paper we present an analysis of temperature and
density measurements above the limb in the quiet corona using new observations
from the EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on \textit{Hinode}. By comparing the Si
and Fe emission observed with EIS we are able to identify emission lines that
yield consistent emission measure distributions. With these data we find that
the distribution of temperatures in the quiet corona above the limb is strongly
peaked near 1 MK, consistent with previous studies. We also find, however, that
there is a tail in the emission measure distribution that extends to higher
temperatures. EIS density measurements from several density sensitive line
ratios are found to be generally consistent with each other and with previous
measurements in the quiet corona. Our analysis, however, also indicates that a
significant fraction of the weaker emission lines observed in the EIS
wavelength ranges cannot be understood with current atomic data.

Bright, pure-rotational lines of molecular hydrogen are detected at the shock
front in all remnants, indicative of radiative cooling from shocks interacting
with dense clouds. We find the excitation of H2 S(0)-S(7) lines in these SNRs
requires two non-dissociative shock components: a slow, 10 km/s C- shock
through clumps of density 10^6 cm^-3, and a faster, 40-70 km/s C- shock through
a medium of density 10^4 cm^-3. The ortho-to-para ratio for molecular hydrogen
in the warm shocked gas is typically found to be much less than the LTE value,
suggesting that these SNRs are propagating into cold quiescent clouds.
Additionally a total of thirteen atomic fine-structure transitions of Ar+,
Ar++, Fe+, Ne+, Ne++, S++, and Si+ are detected. The ionic emitting regions are
spatially segregated from the molecular emitting regions within the IRS slits.
The presence of ionic lines with high appearance potential requires the
presence of much faster, dissociative shocks through a lower density medium.
The IRS slits are sufficiently wide to include regions outside the SNR which
permits emission from diffuse gas around the remnants to be separated from the
shocked emission. We find the diffuse molecular hydrogen gas projected outside
the SNR is excited to a temperature of 100 to 300 K with a warm gas fraction of
0.5 to 15 percent along the line of sight.

microstructure, a split band structure, magnetic domains and crystallographic
textures that affect domain orientation. Probing iron and other bulk
ferromagnetic materials with weak reflected and transmitted inductive low
frequency fields is an easy operation to perform but the responses are
difficult to interpret because of the complexity and variety of the structures
affected by the fields. First starting with a simple single coil induction
measurement and classical EM calculation to show the error is grossly under
estimating the measured response. Extending this experiment to measuring the
transmission of the induced fields allows the extraction of three dispersion
curves which define these internal fields. One dispersion curve yielded an
exceedingly small effective mass of 1.8 10^{-39}kg (1.3 10^{-9} m_e) for those
spin waves. There is a second distinct dispersion curve more representative of
the density function of a zero momentum bound state rather than a propagating
wave. The third dispersion curve describes a magneto-elastic coupling to a very
long wave length propagating mode. These experiments taken together display the
characteristics of a high temperature Bose-Einstein like condensation that can
be initiated by pumping two different states. A weak time dependent field
drives the formation of coupled J=0 spin wave pairs with the reduced effective
mass reflecting the increased size of the coherent state. These field can
dominate induction measurements well past the Curie temperature.

X-ray/EUV selected active binary stars with strong H_alpha emission, V789 Mon
(2RE J0725-002) and GZ Leo (2RE J1101+223). The goal of the study is to
determine radial velocities and fundamental stellar parameters in
chromospherically active binary systems in order to include them in the
activity-rotation and activity-age relations. We carried out high resolution
echelle spectroscopic observations and applied spectral subtraction technique
in order to measure emission excesses due to chromosphere. The detailed study
of activity indicators allowed us to characterize the presence of different
chromospheric features in these systems and enabled to include them in a larger
activity-rotation survey. We computed radial velocities of the systems using
cross correlation with the radial velocity standards. The double-line spectral
binarity was confirmed and the orbital solutions improved for both systems. In
addition, other stellar parameters such as: spectral types, projected
rotational velocities (vsini), and the equivalent width of the lithium LiI
6707.8 AA absorption line were determined.

orbiting Kerr black holes we examine non-geodesic (pressure) effects on the
epicyclic modes properties. Using a perturbation method we derive fully general
relativistic formulas for eigenfunctions and eigenfrequencies of the radial and
vertical epicyclic modes of a slightly non-slender, constant specific angular
momentum torus up to second-order accuracy with respect to the torus thickness.
The behaviour of the axisymmetric and lowest-order ($m=\pm 1$) non-axisymmetric
epicyclic modes is investigated. For an arbitrary black hole spin we find that,
in comparison with the (axisymmetric) epicyclic frequencies of free test
particles, non-slender tori receive negative pressure corrections and exhibit
thus lower frequencies. Our findings are in qualitative agreement with the
results of a recent pseudo-Newtonian study of analogous problem defined within
the Paczy{\'n}ski-Wiita potential. Implications of our results on the
high-frequency QPO models dealing with epicyclic oscillations are addressed.

border between active and inactive (dead) zones constitutes a location where
there is an abrupt change in the accretion flow. The gas accumulation that
ensues triggers the Rossby wave instability, that in turn saturates into
anticyclonic vortices. It was suggested that the trapping of solids within them
leads to a burst of planet formation on very short timescales. We perform
two-dimensional global simulations of the dynamics of gas and solids in a
non-magnetized thin protoplanetary disk with the Pencil Code. We use multiple
particle species of radius 1, 10, 30, and 100 cm, solving for the particles'
gravitational interaction by a particle-mesh method. The dead zone is modeled
as a region of low viscosity. Adiabatic and locally isothermal equations of
state are used. We find that the Rossby wave instability is triggered under a
variety of conditions, thus making vortex formation a robust process. Inside
the vortices, fast accumulation of solids occurs and the particles collapse
into objects of planetary mass in timescales as short as five orbits. Because
the drag force is size-dependent, aerodynamical sorting ensues within the
vortical motion, and the first bound structures formed are composed primarily
of similarly-sized particles. In addition to erosion due to ram pressure, we
identify gas tides from the massive vortices as a disrupting agent of formed
protoplanetary embryos. We also estimate the collisional velocity history of
the particles that compose the most massive embryo by the end of the
simulation, finding that the vast majority of them never experienced a
collision with another particle at speeds faster than 1 m/s.

family of expanding wave solutions of the Einstein equations such that the
Friedmann universe associated with the pure radiation phase of the Standard
Model of Cosmology, is embedded as a single point in this family. All of the
spacetime metrics associated with this family satisfy the equation of state
$p=\rho c^2/3$, correct for the pure radiation phase after inflation in the
Standard Model of the Big Bang. By expanding solutions about the center to
leading order in the Hubble length, the family reduces to a one-parameter
family of expanding spacetimes that represent a perturbation of the Standard
Model. We then derive a co-moving coordinate system in which the perturbed
spacetimes can be compared with the Standard Model. In this coordinate system
we calculate the correction to the Hubble constant, as well as the exact
leading order quadratic correction to the redshift vs luminosity relation for
an observer at the center of the expanding FRW spacetime. The leading order
correction to the redshift vs luminosity relation entails an adjustable free
parameter that introduces an anomalous acceleration. We conclude that any
correction to the redshift vs luminosity relation observed after the radiation
phase of the Big Bang can be accounted for, at the leading order quadratic
level, by adjustment of this free parameter. Since exact non-interacting
expanding waves represent possible time-asymptotic wave patterns for
conservation laws, we propose to further investigate the possibility that these
corrections to the Standard Model might account for the anomalous acceleration
of the galaxies, without the introduction of the cosmological constant.

demonstrates that CMB power spectrum can be reliably estimated solely from WMAP

current paper, we extend this work to estimate the galactic foreground power
spectrum using the WMAP 5 year maps following a self contained analysis. We
apply the model independent method in harmonic basis to estimate the foreground
power spectrum and frequency dependence of combined foregrounds. We also study
the behaviour of synchrotron spectral index variation over different regions of
the sky. We compare our results with those obtained from MEM foreground maps

estimates MEM maps overestimates the foreground power close to galactic plane
and underestimates it at high latitudes.

also present new higher order corrections to the local solution for the mode

radio/X-ray jet. The SE and NW components of the circumnuclear gas are
connected to molecular gas found at larger radii. This gas appears as two
parallel filaments at P.A. = 120 deg, which are coextensive with the long sides
of the 3 kiloparsec parallelogram shape of the previously observed dust
continuum, as well as ionized and pure rotational H2 lines. Spatial and
kinematical asymmetries are apparent in both the circumnuclear and outer gas,
suggesting non-coplanar and/or non-circular motions. We extend to inner radii
(r < 200 pc) previously studied warped disk models built to reproduce the
central parallelogram-shaped structure. Adopting the warped disk model we would
confirm a gap in emission between the radii r = 200 - 800 pc (12'' - 50''), as
has been suggested previously. Although this model explains this prominent
feature, however, our 12CO(2-1) observations show relevant deviations from this
model. Namely, the physical connection between the circumnuclear gas and that
at larger radii, brighter SE and NW sides on the parallelogram-shaped feature,
and an outer curvature of its long sides. Overall it resembles more closely an
S-shaped morphology, a trend that is also found in other molecular species.
Hence, we explore qualitatively the possible contribution of a weak
bi-symmetric potential which would naturally explain these peculiarities.

stars form a relatively flat disc rotating clockwise on the sky, there is a
substantial ongoing debate on whether there is a second, counter-clockwise disc
of stars.
  By means of N-body simulations using our bhint code, we show that two highly
inclined stellar discs with the observed properties cannot be recognised as two
flat circular discs after 5 Myr of mutual interaction. Instead, our
calculations predict a significant warping of the two discs, which we show to
be apparent among the structures observed in the Galactic Centre. While the
high eccentricities of the observed counter-clockwise orbits suggest an
eccentric origin of this system, we show the eccentricity distribution in the
inner part of the more massive clockwise disc to be perfectly consistent with
an initially circular disc in which stellar eccentricities increase due to both
non-resonant and resonant relaxation.

be linked, but the precise nature of this symbiotic relationship is still
poorly understood. Both observations and simulations of galaxy formation
suggest that the energy input from active galactic nuclei (AGN), as the central
supermassive black hole accretes material and grows, heats the interstellar
material and suppresses star formation. In this Letter, we show that most host
galaxies of moderate-luminosity supermassive black holes in the local universe
have intermediate optical colors that imply the host galaxies are transitioning
from star formation to quiescence, the first time this has been shown to be
true for all AGN independent of obscuration. The intermediate colors suggest
that star formation in the host galaxies ceased roughly 100 Myr ago. This
result indicates that either the AGN are very long-lived, accreting for more
than 1 Gyr beyond the end of star formation, or there is a ~100 Myr time delay
between the shutdown of star formation and detectable black hole growth. The
first explanation is unlikely given current estimates for AGN lifetimes, so
low-lumiosity AGN must shut down star formation before substantial black hole
accretion activity is detected. The scarcity of AGN host galaxies in the blue
cloud reported here challenges scenarios where significant star formation and
black hole growth are coeval. Lastly, these observations also strongly support
the `Unified Model' of AGN as the host galaxy colors are independent of
obscuration towards the central engine.

early universe can not be ascribed solely to a higher number of starburst, but
is a result of a lower metallicity and a higher burst strength due to more gas

Initially spherical bubbles and briefly inflated spherical bubbles all with
radii a few times smaller than the intracluster medium (ICM) scale height were
followed as they rose through several ICM scale heights. Such bubbles quickly
evolve into a toroidal form that, in the absence of magnetic influences, is
stable against fragmentation in our simulations. This ring formation results
from (commonly used) initial conditions that cause ICM material below the
bubbles to drive upwards through the bubble, creating a vortex ring; that is,
hydrostatic bubbles develop into ""smoke rings"", if they are initially not very
much smaller or very much larger than the ICM scale height. Even modest ICM
magnetic fields with beta = P_gas/P_mag ~ 10^3 can influence the dynamics of
the bubbles, provided the fields are not tangled on scales comparable to or
smaller than the size of the bubbles. Quasi-uniform, horizontal fields with
initial beta ~ 10^2 bifurcated our bubbles before they rose more than about a
scale height of the ICM, and substantially weaker fields produced clear
distortions. On the other hand, tangled magnetic fields with similar, modest
strengths are generally less easily amplified by the bubble motions and are
thus less influential in bubble evolution. Inclusion of a comparably strong,
tangled magnetic field inside the initial bubbles had little effect on our
bubble evolution, since those fields were quickly diminished through expansion
of the bubble and reconnection of the initial field.

associated primes of the square of the Alexander dual of the edge ideal for an
m-hypergraph H. We prove a general method for detecting associated primes of
the square of the Alexander dual of the edge ideal based on combinatorial
conditions on the m-hypergraph. Also, we demonstrate a more efficient
combinatorial criterion for detecting the non-existence of non-minimal
associated primes. In investigating 3-hypergraphs, we prove a surprising
extension of the previously discovered results for 2-hypergraphs (simple
graphs). For 2-hypergraphs, associated primes of the square of the Alexander
dual of the edge ideal are either of height 2 or of odd height greater than 2.
However, we prove that in the 3-hypergraph case, there is no such restriction -
or indeed any restriction - on the heights of the associated primes. Further,
we generalize this result to any dimension greater than 3. Specifically, given
any integers m, q, and n with 3\leq m\leq q\leq n, we construct a m-hypergraph
of size n with an associated prime of height q. We further prove that it is
possible to construct connected m-hypergraphs under the same conditions.

Sombrero galaxy (M104). This is the closest massive UCD known and the first
spectroscopically verified massive UCD which is located in a low density
environment.
  The object, we name SUCD1, was identified in HST/ACS imaging and confirmed to
be associated with the Sombrero galaxy by its recession velocity obtained from
Keck spectra. The light profile is well fitted by a Wilson model. We measure a
half light size of 14.7 +/- 1.4 pc, an absolute magnitude of M_V = -12.3 mag
(M_K = -15.1 mag) and an internal velocity dispersion of 25.0 +/- 5.6 km/s.
Such values are typical of UCDs. From Lick spectral indices we measure a
luminosity-weighted central age of 12.6 +/- 0.9 Gyrs, [Fe/H] of -0.08 +/- 0.08
dex and [alpha/Fe] of 0.06 +/- 0.07 dex. The lack of colour gradients suggests
these values are representative of the entire UCD. The derived stellar and
virial masses are the same, within errors, at ~3.3 x 10E7 Msun. Thus we find no
strong evidence for dark matter or the need to invoke a non-standard IMF.
  We also report arguably the first X-ray detection of a bona fide UCD, which
we attribute to the presence of Low-Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs). The X-ray
luminosity of L_X = 0.56 x 10E38 erg/s is consistent with the values observed
for GCs of the same metallicity. Overall we find SUCD1 has properties similar
to other known UCDs and massive GCs.

Standard packed format arrays fully utilize storage (array space) but provide

using Level 3 BLAS as RFPF is a standard full format representation. Also, RFPF
requires exactly the same minimal storage as packed format. Each LAPACK full

RFPF routine based on eight possible data layouts of RFPF. This new RFPF
routine usually consists of two calls to the corresponding LAPACK full format
routine and two calls to Level 3 BLAS routines. This means {\it no} new
software is required. As examples, we present LAPACK routines for Cholesky
factorization, Cholesky solution and Cholesky inverse computation in RFPF to
illustrate this new work and to describe its performance on several commonly

processing is about the same while using half the storage. Performance gains
are roughly one to a factor of 43 for serial and one to a factor of 97 for SMP

40307, suggesting these planets may be rocky. However, with only radial
velocity data, it is impossible to determine if these planets are rocky or
gaseous. Here we exploit various dynamical features of the system in order to
assess the physical properties of the planets. Observations allow for circular
orbits, but a numerical integration shows that the eccentricities must be at
least 0.0001. Also, planets b and c are so close to the star that tidal effects
are significant. If planet b has tidal parameters similar to the terrestrial
planets in the Solar System and a remnant eccentricity larger than 0.001, then,
going back in time, the system would have been unstable within the lifetime of
the star (which we estimate to be 6.1 +/- 1.6 Gyr). Moreover, if the
eccentricities are that large and the inner planet is rocky, then its tidal
heating may be an order of magnitude greater than extremely volcanic Io, on a
per unit surface area basis. If planet b is not terrestrial, e.g. Neptune-like,
these physical constraints would not apply. This analysis suggests the planets
are not terrestrial-like, and are more like our giant planets. In either case,
we find that the planets probably formed at larger radii and migrated early-on
(via disk interactions) into their current orbits. This study demonstrates how
the orbital and dynamical properties of exoplanet systems may be used to
constrain the planets' physical properties.

propagation and dissipation are included. Bohm diffusion as well as the
diffusion with the power-law momentum dependence are modeled. As long as the
acceleration time scale to relativistic energies is much shorter than the
dynamical evolution time scale of the shocks, the precursor and subshock
transition approach the time-asymptotic state, which depends on the shock sonic
and Alfv\'enic Mach numbers and the CR injection efficiency. For the diffusion
models we employ, the shock precursor structure evolves in an approximately
self-similar fashion, depending only on the similarity variable, x/(u_s t).
During this self-similar stage, the CR distribution at the subshock maintains a
characteristic form as it evolves: the sum of two power-laws with the slopes
determined by the subshock and total compression ratios with an exponential
cutoff at the highest accelerated momentum, p_{max}(t). Based on the results of
the DSA simulations spanning a range of Mach numbers, we suggest functional
forms for the shock structure parameters, from which the aforementioned form of
CR spectrum can be constructed. These analytic forms may represent approximate
solutions to the DSA problem for astrophysical shocks during the self-similar
evolutionary stage as well as during the steady-state stage if p_{max} is
fixed.

at the base stations for downlink transmission. For precoding at the base
stations, channel state information (CSI) is essential at the base stations. A
popular technique for obtaining this CSI in time division duplex (TDD) systems
is uplink training by utilizing the reciprocity of the wireless medium. This
paper mathematically characterizes the impact that uplink training has on the
performance of such multi-cell multiple antenna systems. When non-orthogonal
training sequences are used for uplink training, the paper shows that the
precoding matrix used by the base station in one cell becomes corrupted by the
channel between that base station and the users in other cells in an
undesirable manner. This paper analyzes this fundamental problem of pilot
contamination in multi-cell systems. Furthermore, it develops a new multi-cell
MMSE-based precoding method that mitigate this problem. In addition to being a
linear precoding method, this precoding method has a simple closed-form
expression that results from an intuitive optimization problem formulation.
Numerical results show significant performance gains compared to certain

lower densities than those in the center, and 3) ionization parameters of the

varying the ionizing continuum attenuation, assuming a hollowed biconical

magnetic field is given by the Heaviside step function in order to represent
the non-uniform stretching of the dynamo filament. These results are obtained

found by Lewis et al [\textbf{Phys Rev D (2000)}] by using the dispute between
the dynamo action and monopole flux. Since magnetic monopoles flow dispute the
dynamo action, it seems reasonable that their presence leads to a slow dynamo
action in the best hypothesis or a decay of the magnetic field. Hindmarsh et al
have computed the magnetic energy decay in the early universe as
${E}_{M}\approx{t^{-0.5}}$, while in our slow dynamo case linearization of the
growth rate leads to a variation od magnetic energy of

characteristics of the M31 luminous populations. In this work we present the
second year results of our pixel lensing campaign carried out towards M31 using
the 152 cm Cassini telescope in Loiano. We have established an automatic
pipeline for the detection and the characterisation of microlensing variations.
We have carried out a complete simulation of the experiment and evaluated the
expected signal, including an analysis of the efficiency of our pipeline. As a
result, we select 1-2 candidate microlensing events (according to different
selection criteria). This output is in agreement with the expected rate of M31
self-lensing events. However, the statistics are still too low to draw
definitive conclusions on MACHO lensing.

relation between stress (or strain) and velocity forms the basis of non-linear
acoustics. In homogeneous solids, conventional time-of-flight techniques have
measured this dependence with spectacular precision. In heterogeneous media
like concrete, the direct (ballistic) wave around 500 kHz is strongly
attenuated and conventional techniques are less efficient. In this manuscript,
the effect of weak stress changes on the late arrivals constituting the
acoustic diffuse coda is tracked. A resolution of $2.10^{-5}$ in relative
velocity change is attained which corresponds to a sensitivity to stress change
of better than 50 kPa. Therefore the technique described here provides an
original way to measure the non-linear parameter with stress variations on the

mathematical physics. This relates to the fact that closed exterior
skew-symmetric differential forms are invariants. The concept of ""Exterior
differential forms"" was introduced by E.Cartan for a notation of integrand
expressions, which can create the integral invariants.(The existence of
integral invariants was recognized by A.Poincare while studying the general
equations of dynamics.)
  All invariant mathematical formalisms are based on invariant properties of
closed exterior forms. The invariant properties of closed exterior forms
explicitly or implicitly manifest themselves essentially in all formalisms of
field theory, such as the Hamilton formalism, tensor approaches, group methods,
quantum mechanics equations, the Yang-Mills theory and others. They lie at the
basis of field theory.
  However, in this case the question of how the closed exterior forms are
obtained arises. In present work it is shown that closed exterior forms, which
possess the invariant properties, are obtained from skew-symmetric differential
forms, which, as contrasted to exterior forms, are defined on nonintegrable
manifolds. The process of generating closed exterior forms describes the
mechanism of realization of invariants and invariant structures.

spectrum is an elementary divisor ring if and only if so is $R/L$ for each
minimal prime ideal $L$. This result is obtained by using the quotient space
$\mathrm{pSpec} R$ of the prime spectrum of the ring $R$ modulo the equivalence
generated by the inclusion. When every prime ideal contains only one minimal
prime, for instance if $R$ is arithmetical, $\mathrm{pSpec} R$ is Hausdorff and
there is a bijection between this quotient space and the minimal prime spectrum
$\mathrm{Min} R$, which is a homeomorphism if and only if $\mathrm{Min} R$ is
compact. If $x$ is a closed point of $\mathrm{pSpec} R$, there is a pure ideal
$A(x)$ such that $x=V(A(x))$. If $R$ is almost clean, i.e. each element is the
sum of a regular element with an idempotent, it is shown that $\mathrm{pSpec}
R$ is totally disconnected and, $\forall x\in\mathrm{pSpec} R$, $R/A(x)$ is
almost clean; the converse holds if every principal ideal is finitely
presented. Some questions posed by Facchini and Faith at the second
International Fez Conference on Commutative Ring Theory in 1995, are also
investigated. If $R$ is a commutative ring for which the ring $Q(R/A)$ of
quotients of $R/A$ is an IF-ring for each proper ideal $A$, it is proved that

Based on the chemical network osu.2003, we used two different sensitivity
methods to determine the most important reactions as a function of time for
models of dense cold clouds. Of these reactions, we concentrated on those
between C and C3 and between C and C5, both for their effect on specific
important species such as CO and for their general effect on large numbers of
species. We then used ab initio and kinetic methods to determine an improved
rate coefficient for the former reaction and a new set of products, plus a
slightly changed rate coefficient for the latter. Putting our new results in a
pseudo-time-dependent model of cold dense clouds, we found that the abundances
of many species are altered at early times, based on large changes in the
abundances of CO and atomic C. We compared the effect of these new rate
coefficients/products on the comparison with observed abundances and found that
they shift the best agreement from 3e4 yr to (1-3)e5 yr.

to the Virgo cluster (VCC 0758) and form a non-interactive pair with NGC 4365

optical major axis and is extended almost up to 1\arcmin. The extinction curve
derived for NGC 4370 is found to run parallel to Galactic extinction curve,
implying that the properties of dust in NGC 4370 are identical to those of the
canonical grains in the Milky Way. The $R_V$ value is found to be equal to
2.85$\pm$0.05 and is consitent with the values reported for the dust lane
galaxies. The total dust content of NGC 4370 estimated using optical extinction
and IRAS flux densities are found to be equal to $4.4\times 10^4$ \msol and
$2.0\times 10^5$ \msol, respectively. As regard to the origin of dust and ISM
in this galaxy, the accumulated dust by this galaxy over its life-time is
insufficient to account for the detected mass by optical means, which in turn
imply that the ISM might have been acquired by the NGC 4370 through a merger
like event. An attempt is also made to study the apparent spatial
correspondence between the multiple phases of ISM, i.e., hot gas, warm gas and
dust in this galaxy by obtaining optical emission maps from narrow band imaging
and diffuse X-ray emission map obtained from the analysis of \emph{Chandra}

pair-breaking effect by the aerogel. We use the quasiclassical Green's function
to determine self-consistently the spatial variations of the p-wave order
parameter and the impurity self-energy. On the basis of the fully
self-consistent calculation, we analyze the spatial dependence of the pair
function (anomalous Green's function). The spin-triplet pair function has in
general even-frequency odd-parity and odd-frequency even-parity components. We
show that the admixture of the even- and odd-frequency pairs occurs near the
aerogel/superfluid $^3$He-B interface. Among those Cooper pairs, only the
odd-frequency s-wave pair can penetrate deep into the aerogel layer. As a
result, the proximity-induced superfluidity in a thick aerogel layer is
dominated by the Cooper pair with the odd-frequency s-wave symmetry. We also
analyze the local density of states and show that it has a characteristic
zero-energy peak reflecting the existence of the odd-frequency s-wave pair, in
agreement with previous works using the Usadel equation.

Here alpha is independently obtained with both the wavelets and the Hurst R/S

tens of minutes down to 10 seconds with stochastic persistent memory in time.
alpha and Sigma appear anticorrelated. In the alpha-Sigma diagram V709 Cas

spectra from proton-proton interactions in supernova remnants (SNRs). Here, we
assume that a fraction of the SNR's energy is transferred to the acceleration
of cosmic rays. We also investigate the possibility of detecting Gamma Ray
Bursts from nearby starburst galaxies, using the catalog defined here. We show
that the radio emission is only weakly dependent on the magnetic field. It
turns out that the intensity of the radio signal is directly proportional to
the number of supernova explosions, which scales with the far-infrared
luminosity. In addition, we find that high-energy photons from proton-proton
interactions in SNRs in starbursts can make up several percent of the diffuse
gamma-ray background. The neutrino flux from the same sources has a maximum
energy of ~1e5 GeV. Neutrinos can, on the other hand, can be observed if a
Gamma Ray Burst happens in a nearby starburst. About 0.03 GRBs per year are
expected to occur in the entire catalog. The true number is expected to be even
higher, since we only include the brightest sources. The number of events per
burst in IceCube varies between about one event and more than 1000 events. This
provides good prospects for IceCube to detect a significant event, since the

may be detected as pulsars. Only a few hundred such systems are presently known
in the Galaxy. However, there should be many more binaries with basically
invisible compact objects in non-interacting binaries. Here we report the
discovery of unseen compact companions to hot subdwarfs in close binary
systems. Hot subdwarfs are evolved helium-core-burning stars that have lost
most of their hydrogen envelopes, often due to binary interactions. Using
high-resolution spectra and assuming tidal synchronisation of the subdwarfs, we
were able to constrain the companion masses of 32 binaries. While most hot
subdwarf binaries have white-dwarf or late-type main sequence companions, as
predicted by binary evolution models, at least 5% of the observed subdwarfs
must have very massive companions: unusually heavy white dwarfs, neutron stars
and, in some cases, even black holes. We present evolutionary models which show
that such binaries can indeed form if the system has evolved through two
common-envelope phases. This new connection between hot subdwarfs, which are
numerous in the Galaxy, and massive compact objects may lead to a tremendous
increase in the number of known neutron stars and black holes and shed some

in turn collapses to a current sheet. The system then evolves through a series
of horizontal and vertical current sheets, with associated changes in
connectivity, i.e. the system exhibits oscillatory reconnection. Our final
state is non-potential (but in force balance) due to asymmetric heating from
the shocks. Larger amplitudes in our initial condition correspond to larger
values of the final current density left in the system. The inclusion of
nonlinear terms introduces several new features to the system that were absent

distributed and comes at a very low cost in terms of protocol overhead; in
addition, simulation results show that the proposed solution can achieve the
aforementioned goals under different network scenarios, provided that a
sufficient number of information replicas are injected into the network. This
observation calls for a further step: in the realistic case where the user

adapt the number of information replicas to the changes in the information

H13CO+ and HN13C, as the shock propagates through the unperturbed medium. Our
results show that the SiO emission arising from the early stage of the magnetic
precursor typically has very narrow line profiles slightly shifted in velocity
with respect to the ambient cloud. This narrow emission is generated in the
region where the bulk of the ion fluid has already slipped to larger velocities
in the precursor as observed toward the young L1448-mm outflow. This strongly
suggests that the detection of narrow SiO emission and of an ion enhancement in
young shocks, is produced by the magnetic precursor of C-shocks. In addition,
our model shows that the different velocity components observed toward this

global correlations in the system when subject to different forms of local
decoherence. In the presence of decay, it has been shown that the system
displays quantum correlations only when the noise strength is above a certain
threshold. We extend this result to the case of a Heisenberg XYZ exchange
interaction and revise and clarify the mechanisms underlying this behaviour. In
the presence of pure dephasing, we show that the system always remains
separable in the steady state. When both types of noise are present, we show
that the system can still exhibit entanglement for long times, provided that
the pure dephasing rate is not too large.

$$d\mathbb{P}^\beta(\mu)=\frac{1}{Z}\exp(-\beta\cdot {Ent} (\mu|m))\cdot
d\mathbb{P}^0(\mu).$$
