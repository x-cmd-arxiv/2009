With this module we demonstrate the parameter space that can account for the

have some tension between the results of the HESS experiment and the

ways to alleviate this tension and how upcoming experiments will be able to

ATIC is dark matter annihilation in the galactic halo. Depending on the
annihilation channel, the electron/positron signal could be accompanied by a
galactic gamma ray or neutrino flux, and the non-detection of such fluxes
constrains the couplings and halo properties of dark matter. In this paper, we
study the interplay of electron data with gamma ray and neutrino constraints in
the context of cascade annihilation models, where dark matter annihilates into
light degrees of freedom which in turn decay into leptons in one or more steps.
Electron and muon cascades give a reasonable fit to the PAMELA and ATIC data.
Compared to direct annihilation, cascade annihilations can soften gamma ray
constraints from final state radiation by an order of magnitude. However, if
dark matter annihilates primarily into muons, the neutrino constraints are
robust regardless of the number of cascade decay steps. We also examine the
electron data and gamma ray/neutrino constraints on the recently proposed
""axion portal"" scenario.

identified based on their Safronov number. We use the CoRoTlux code to compare
simulated events to the sample of discovered planets and test the statistical

planetary companions based on radial velocity discoveries and a planetary
evolution model, then apply a detection criterion that includes both
statistical and red noise sources. We compare the yield of our simulated survey
with the ensemble of 31 well-characterized giant transiting planets, using a
multivariate logistic analysis to assess whether the simulated distribution
matches the known transiting planets. Our multivariate analysis shows that our
simulated sample and observations are consistent to 76%. The mass vs. period
correlation for giant planets first observed with radial velocity holds with
transiting planets. Our model naturally explains the correlation between planet
surface gravity and period and the one between planet radius and stellar
effective temperature. Finally, we are also able to reproduce the previously
observed apparent bimodal distribution of Safronov numbers in 10% of our

shows that the evidence for the existence of two groups of planets with

simultaneous active and passive microrheology experiments, using the same
micron-sized probe specifically bound to the actin cortex. The free motion of
the probe exhibits a constrained, subdiffusive behavior at short time scales (t
< 2s), and a directed, superdiffusive behavior at larger time scales, while, in
response to a step force, its creep function presents the usual weak power law
dependence with time. Combining the results of both experiments, we precisely
measure for the first time the power spectrum of the force fluctuations exerted
on this probe, which lies more than one order of magnitude above the spectrum
expected at equilibrium, and greatly depends on frequency. We retrieve an
effective temperature Teff of the system, as an estimate of the departure from
thermal equilibrium. This departure is especially pronounced on long time
scales, where Teff bears the footprint of the cooperative activity of motors
pulling on the actin network. ATP depletion reduces the fluctuating force
amplitude and results in a sharp decrease of Teff towards equilibrium.

structure of the divergent terms reveals that the theory simply obtained from
the ordinary one by trading products for star products is not renormalizable.
Moreover, because of the different renormalization undergone by the abelian

incompatible with the requests of renormalizability, gauge and N=1/2

to its vectorial subgroup, the introduction of an explicit symmetry breaking

found via the minimization of the expectation value of the perturbing
hamiltonian between different vacua as prescribed by Dashen. The procedure of
finding the correct vacuum of the theory may result in the spontaneous breaking
of CP symmetry even if one initially demands CP invariance on the perturbation.
In this work we study in detail models where the perturbation is provided by
four-Fermi operators. We present exact treatment for models with two fermion
flavors and study the three flavor case in depth numerically. We show that
after Dashen procedure is applied the solutions for the true vacuum fall in
three classes with different CP breaking patterns. Critical transitions is
possible between these classes as one varies the parameters of the
perturbation. We rigorously show that at these transitions a pseudo-Goldstone
boson mass vanishes. We also advocate, and substantiate with numerical
statistical analysis for various types of models, that if one imposes CP
invariance on the perturbation before solving the vacuum alignment, the
resulting vacuum structure will have a sizable probability for a light
pseudo-Goldstone boson mass. That is a statistical variant of Peccei-Quinn

of weakly coupled plasmas is considered and the coupled mode formula within the

equation. We show how the frequency integration can be performed by standard
methods without applying additional approximations. Due to the well-defined
approximation scheme, the results can serve as a benchmark for more approximate
theories and numerical simulations in this limit. The coupled mode electron-ion
transfer rates show a considerable reduction compared to the Fermi-Golden Rule
approach for certain parameters and very small changes for other systems. We
demonstrate how these coupled mode effects are connected to the occurrence of
ion acoustic modes and under which conditions they occur. Interestingly,
coupled mode effects can also occur for plasmas with very high electron
temperatures; a regime, where the Landau-Spitzer approach is believed to give
accurate results. Finally, we extend the approach to systems with strongly
coupled ions by applying static local field corrections. This extension can
substantially increase the coupled mode effects.

relations extend the set resulting from the quasi-shuffle product between
harmonic sums studied earlier. Unlike the shuffle relations, they depend on the
value of the quantities considered. Up to weight {\sf w = 5}, 242 nested

to consider the sub-set of harmonic sums not containing an index $i = -1$,
which consists out of 69 sums. The algebraic relations reduce this set to 30
sums. Due to the structural relations a final reduction of the number of
harmonic sums to {15} basic functions is obtained. These functions can be
represented in terms of factorial series, supplemented by harmonic sums which
are algebraically reducible. Complete analytic representations are given for
these {15} meromorphic functions in the complex plane deriving their

the end of a protracted accretion outburst. We confirm the finding of Shternin

consistent with a low impurity parameter. We describe the basic physics that
sets the broken power-law form of the cooling lightcurve. The initial power law
decay gives a direct measure of the temperature profile, and hence the thermal
flux during outburst, in the outer crust. The time of the break, at hundreds of
days post-outburst, corresponds to the thermal time where the solid transitions
from a classical to quantum crystal, close to neutron drip. We calculate in
detail the constraints on the crust parameters of both KS 1731-260 and MXB

require that the neutrons do not contribute significantly to the heat capacity

circularly polarized few cycle pulses with a time delay $T_{d}$. We address the
problem within a classical framework, and mimic the behavior of the

electron trajectories. These trajectories are initially weighted with the
quasi-static tunneling rate, and with suitably chosen distributions for the
momentum components parallel and perpendicular to the laser-field polarization,
in the temporal region for which it is nearly linearly polarized. We show that,
if the time delay $T_{d}$ is of the order of the pulse length, the
electron-momentum distributions, as functions of the parallel momentum
components, are highly asymmetric and dependent on the carrier-envelope (CE)
phase. As this delay is decreased, this asymmetry gradually vanishes. We
explain this behavior in terms of the available phase space, the quasi-static
tunneling rate and the recollision rate for the first electron, for different
sets of trajectories. Our results show that polarization-gating technique may
provide an efficient way to study the NSDI dynamics in the single-cycle limit,

the burnt version they additionally need to be oriented burnt-side down. We
present an algorithm with the average number of flips, needed to sort a stack
of n burnt pancakes, equal to 7n/4+O(1) and a randomized algorithm for the

K-band Faber-Jackson relations and the Fundamental Plane display a moderate
evolution for the field early-type galaxies. Lenticular (S0) galaxies feature
on average a stronger luminosity evolution and bluer rest-frame colours which
can be explained that they comprise more diverse stellar populations compared
to elliptical galaxies. The evolution of the FP can be interpreted as an
average change in the dynamical mass-to-light ratio of our galaxies as <\Delta
\log{(M/L_B)}/z>=-0.74\pm0.08. The M/L evolution of these field galaxies
suggests a continuous mass assembly of field early-type galaxies during the

Independent evidence for recent SF activity is provided by spectroscopic (OII
em., Hdelta) and photometric (rest-frame colors) diagnostics. Based on the
Hdelta absorption feature we detect a weak residual SF for galaxies that
accounts for 5%-10% in the total stellar mass of these galaxies. The
co-evolution in the luminosity and mass of our galaxies favours a downsizing
formation process. We find some evidence that our galaxies experienced a period
of SF quenching, possible triggered by AGN activity that is in good agreement

  pages",,,,"math-ph hep-th math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This Thesis presents some physically motivated criteria for the existence of
particles and infra-particles in a given quantum field theory. It is based on a
refined spectral theory of automorphism groups describing the energy-momentum
transfer of local observables. In particular, a novel decomposition of the
algebra of local observables into spectral subspaces is constructed. Apart from
the counterparts of the pure-point and absolutely continuous subspaces,
familiar from the spectral theory of operators, there appears a new
'point-continuous' subspace. It belongs to the singular-continuous part of the
decomposition, but is finite-dimensional in a large class of models; its
dimension carries information about the infrared structure of a theory. It is
shown that this point-continuous subspace is trivial in all theories complying
with a regularity condition proposed in this work. Moreover, this condition
entails the existence of particles if the theory admits a stress-energy tensor.
The uniqueness of the decomposition of the algebra of observables into the
pure-point and continuous subspace is established by proving an ergodic theorem
for automorphism groups. The proof is based on physically motivated phase space
conditions which have a number of interesting consequences pertaining to the
vacuum structure such as the convergence of physical states to a unique vacuum
under large timelike translations.

time. For non-zero surface tension, we show that the the harmonic moments decay
in time rather than exhibiting the divergences of other representations. Our
laboratory observations confirm the theoretical predictions and demonstrate
that an interface dynamics description in terms of harmonic moments is
physically realizable and robust. In addition, by extending the theory to

function and the ratio between the cluster mass and the stellar mass. I
highlight the promising potential that the study of this phase holds in terms
of deciphering star cluster formation and galaxy evolution, and (some of) the
issues which are to be dealt with before achieving this goal.

next-nearest neighbor coupling $J_{2}$ numerically using the density-matrix
renormalization group (DMRG) method and analytically employing the
Schwinger-Boson mean-field theory (SBMFT). Up to relatively strong values of
the anisotropy, within both methods we find quantum fluctuations to stabilize
the N\'{e}el ordered state above the classically stable region. Whereas SBMFT
suggests a fluctuation-induced first order transition between the N\'{e}el
state and a stripe antiferromagnet for $1/3\leq J_{1x}/J_{1y}\leq 1$ and an
intermediate paramagnetic region opening only for very strong anisotropy, the
DMRG results clearly demonstrate that the two magnetically ordered phases are
separated by a quantum disordered region for all values of the anisotropy with
the remarkable implication that the quantum paramagnetic phase of the spatially
isotropic $J_{1}$-$J_{2}$ model is continuously connected to the limit of
decoupled Haldane spin chains. Our findings indicate that for S=1 quantum
fluctuations in strongly frustrated antiferromagnets are crucial and not
correctly treated on the semiclassical level.

velocities and astrometry for the GJ876 planetary system using a
self-consistent model that accounts for the planet-planet interactions.
Assuming the three planets so far identified in the system are coplanar, we
find that including the astrometry in the analysis does not result in a
best-fit inclination significantly different than that found by Rivera and
collaborators from analyzing the radial velocities alone. In this unique case,
the planet-planet interactions are of such significance that the radial
velocity data set is more sensitive to the inclination of the system through
the dependence of the interactions on the true masses of the two gas giant
planets in the system (planets b and c). The astrometry does allow
determination of the absolute orbital inclination (i.e. distinguishing between
i and 180-i) and longitude of the ascending node for planet b, which allows us
to quantify the mutual inclination angle between its orbit and planet c's orbit
when combined with the dynamical considerations. We find that the planets have
a mutual inclination of 5.0 +3.9 -2.3 degrees. This result constitutes the
first determination of the degree of coplanarity in an exoplanetary system
around a normal star. That we find the two planets' orbits are nearly coplanar,
like the orbits of the Solar System planets, indicates that the planets likely
formed in a circumstellar disk, and that their subsequent dynamical evolution
into a 2:1 mean motion resonance only led to excitation of a small mutual
inclination. This investigation demonstrates how the degree of coplanarity for
other exoplanetary systems could also be established using data obtained from
existing facilities.

hydrodynamic simulations with a well-constrained model for galactic outflows.
Without outflows, halos contain roughly the cosmic fraction of baryons,
slightly lowered at high masses owing to pressure support from hot gas. The
star formation efficiency is large and increases monotonically to low masses,
in disagreement with data. With outflows, the baryon fraction is increasingly
suppressed in halos to lower masses. A Milky Way-sized halo at z=0 has about
60% of the cosmic fraction of baryons, so ""missing"" halo baryons have largely
been evacuated, rather than existing in some hidden form. Large halos (>10^13
Mo) contain 85% of their cosmic share of baryons, which explains the mild
missing baryon problem seen in clusters. By comparing results at z=3 and z=0,
we show that most of the baryon removal occurs at early epochs in larger halos,
while smaller halos lose baryons more recently. Star formation efficiency is
maximized in halos of ~10^13 Mo, dropping significantly to lower masses, which
helps reconcile the sub-L* slope of the observed stellar and halo mass
functions. These trends are predominantly driven by differential wind
recycling, namely, that wind material takes longer to return to low-mass
galaxies than high-mass galaxies. The hot gas content of halos is mostly
unaffected by outflows, showing that outflows tend to blow holes and escape
rather than deposit their energy into halo gas.

Previously, the distinct nodal and anti-nodal responses have provided strong
support for the ""two-gap scenario"" of the cuprates in which the pseudogap
competes with superconductivity. Instead, our theory supports a picture in
which the pseudogap derives from pairing correlations, identifying the two gap
components with non-condensed and condensed pairs. It leads to reasonably good
agreement with a range of different experiments in the moderately underdoped

microscopic rather than a phenomenological theory. We briefly address the more

and at the same time compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors for application to
multiple right-hand sides, is described. For the first right-hand side,
eigenvectors with small eigenvalues are computed while simultaneously solving
the linear system. Two versions of this algorithm are given. The first is
called Lan-DR and is based on conjugate gradient (CG) implementation of the
Lanczos algorithm. This version will be optimal for the hermitian positive
definite case. The second version is called MinRes-DR and is based on the
minimum residual (MinRes) implementation of Lanczos algorithm. This version is
optimal for indefinite hermitian systems where the CG algorithm is subject to
instabilities. For additional right-hand sides, we project over the calculated
eigenvectors to speed up convergence. The algorithms used for subsequent
right-hand sides are called D-CG and D-MinRes respectively. After some
introductory examples are given, we show tests for the case of Wilson fermions
at kappa critical. A considerable speed up in the convergence is observed
compared to unmodified CG and MinRes.

(GC) fluid displays anomalous properties such as expansion upon isobaric
cooling (density anomaly) and increased single-particle mobility upon
isothermal compression (self-diffusivity anomaly). We investigate how
temperature and density affect its short-range translational structural order,
as characterized by the two-body excess entropy. We find that there is a wide
range of conditions for which the short-range translational order of the GC
fluid decreases upon isothermal compression (structural order anomaly). The
origin of the structural anomaly is qualitatively similar to that of other
anomalous fluids and is connected to how compression affects static
correlations at different length scales. We find that the self-diffusivity of
the GC fluid obeys a scaling relationship with the two-body excess entropy that
is very similar to the one observed for a variety of simple liquids. One
consequence of this relationship is that the state points for which structural,
self-diffusivity, and density anomalies of the Gaussian-core fluid occur appear
as cascading regions on the temperature-density plane, a phenomenon observed
earlier for models of waterlike fluids. There are, however, key differences
between the anomalies of GC and waterlike fluids, and we discuss how those can
be qualitatively understood by considering the respective interparticle
potentials of these models. Finally, we note that the self-diffusivity of the
Gaussian-core fluid obeys different scaling laws depending on whether the
two-body or total excess entropy is considered. This finding, which deserves
more comprehensive future study, appears to underscore the significance of
higher-body correlations for the behavior of fluids with bounded interactions.

broadband transmission. As a natural consequence of combining OFDM with
multi-hop relaying, the allocation of per-hop subcarrier power and per-hop
transmission time is crucial in optimizing the network performance. This paper
is concerned with the end-to-end information outage in an OFDM based linear
relay network. Our goal is to find an optimal power and time adaptation policy
to minimize the outage probability under a long-term total power constraint. We
solve the problem in two steps. First, for any given channel realization, we
derive the minimum short-term power required to meet a target transmission
rate. We show that it can be obtained through two nested bisection loops. To
reduce computational complexity and signalling overhead, we also propose a
sub-optimal algorithm. In the second step, we determine a power threshold to
control the transmission on-off so that the long-term total power constraint is
satisfied. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the performance of the
proposed power and time adaptation schemes with respect to other resource

higher order squeezing criterion is derived under this framework by using an

is also generalized for multi-photon Bose operators of Brandt and Greenberg.
Similarly, condition for higher order subpoissonian photon statistics is
derived by normal ordering of higher powers of number operator. Further, with
the help of simple density matrices, it is shown that the higher order
antibunching (HOA) and higher order subpoissonian photon statistics (HOSPS) are
not the manifestation of the same phenomenon and consequently it is incorrect
to use the condition of HOA as a test of HOSPS. It is also shown that the HOA

higher order squeezing does not show HOSPS and HOA. The opposite is observed in

way to extend the Hubble diagram to very high redshift. To this aim, the
luminosity (or isotropic emitted energy) of a GRB at redshift z must be
evaluated from a correlation with a distance independent quantity so that one
can then solve for the luminosity distance D_L(z) and hence the distance
modulus mu(z). Averaging over five different two parameters correlations and
using a fiducial cosmological model to calibrate them, Schaefer (2007) has
compiled a sample of 69 GRBs with measured mu(z) which has since then been
widely used to constrain cosmological parameters. We update here that sample by
many aspects. First, we add a recently found correlation for the X - ray
afterglow and use a Bayesian inspired fitting method to calibrate the different
GRBs correlations known insofar assuming a fiducial LCDM model in agreement
with the recent WMAP5 data. Averaging over six correlations, we end with a new
GRBs Hubble diagram comprising 83 objects. We also extensively explore the
impact of varying the fiducial cosmological model considering how the estimated
mu(z) change as a function of the $(\Omega_M, w_0, w_a)$ parameters of the
Chevallier - Polarski - Linder phenomenological dark energy equation of state.
In order to avoid the need of assuming an {\it a priori} cosmological model, we
present a new calibration procedure based on a model independent local
regression estimate of mu(z) using the Union SNeIa sample to calibrate the GRBs
correlations. This finally gives us a GRBs Hubble diagram made out of 69 GRBs
whose estimated distance modulus mu(z) is almost independent on the underlying
cosmological model.

multivariate statistics. In practice it is increasingly frequent to work with
data matrices $X$ of dimension $n\times p$, where $p$ and $n$ are both large.
Results from random matrix theory show very clearly that in this setting,
standard estimators like the sample covariance matrix perform in general very
poorly. In this ""large $n$, large $p$"" setting, it is sometimes the case that
practitioners are willing to assume that many elements of the population
covariance matrix are equal to 0, and hence this matrix is sparse. We develop
an estimator to handle this situation. The estimator is shown to be consistent
in operator norm, when, for instance, we have $p\asymp n$ as $n\to\infty$. In
other words the largest singular value of the difference between the estimator
and the population covariance matrix goes to zero. This implies consistency of
all the eigenvalues and consistency of eigenspaces associated to isolated
eigenvalues. We also propose a notion of sparsity for matrices, that is,
""compatible"" with spectral analysis and is independent of the ordering of the
variables.

visiting large parts of search space which would not improve the solution found
so far (i.e., result in a solution with fewer number of sires). This is of
particular importance when the number of allelic types in the progeny array is
large and when the minimum number of sires is expected to be large. Precisely
in such cases it is important to know the minimum number of sires: this number
gives an exact bound on the most likely number of sires estimated by a random
search algorithm in a parameter region where it may be difficult to determine
whether it has converged. We apply our algorithm to data from the marine snail,
Littorina saxatilis.

large 1D-array of hotspots in a thermoconvective system. Increasing the driving
force, a stationary cellular pattern becomes unstable towards a mixed pattern
of irregular clusters which consist of time-dependent localized patterns of
variable spatiotemporal coherence. These irregular clusters coexist with the
basic cellular pattern. The Fourier spectra corresponding to this
synchronization transition reveals the weak coupling of a resonant triad. This
pattern saturates with the formation of a unique domain of great spatiotemporal
coherence. As we further increase the driving force, a supercritical
bifurcation to a spatiotemporal beating regime takes place. The new pattern is
characterized by the presence of two stationary clusters with a characteristic
zig-zag geometry. The Fourier analysis reveals a stronger coupling and enables
to find out that this beating phenomena is produced by the splitting of the
fundamental spatiotemporal frequencies in a narrow band. Both secondary
instabilities are phase-like synchronization transitions with global and
absolute character. Far beyond this threshold, a new instability takes place
when the system is not able to sustain the spatial frequency splitting,
although the temporal beating remains inside these domains. These experimental
results may support the understanding of other systems in nature undergoing
similar clustering processes.

network connectivity continuum where the probability of all nodes being
connected is either close to unity, assuming connected paths between all nodes
(mobile ad hoc networks), or it is close to zero, assuming no multi-hop paths
exist at all (delay-tolerant networks). In this paper, we argue that a sizable
fraction of networks lies between these extremes and is characterized by the
existence of partial paths, i.e. multi-hop path segments that allow forwarding
data closer to the destination even when no end-to-end path is available. A
fundamental issue in such networks is dealing with disruptions of end-to-end
paths. Under a stochastic model, we compare the performance of the established
end-to-end retransmission (ignoring partial paths), against a forwarding
mechanism that leverages partial paths to forward data closer to the
destination even during disruption periods. Perhaps surprisingly, the
alternative mechanism is not necessarily superior. However, under a stochastic
monotonicity condition between current v.s. future path length, which we
demonstrate to hold in typical network models, we manage to prove superiority
of the alternative mechanism in stochastic dominance terms. We believe that
this study could serve as a foundation to design more efficient data transfer
protocols for partially-connected networks, which could potentially help
reducing the gap between applications that can be supported over disconnected
networks and those requiring full connectivity.

estimate the accuracy with which one can use gravitational wave observations of
double neutron star inspiral to measure parameters of the neutron-star equation
of state. The simulations use the evolution and initial-data codes of Shibata
and Uryu to compute the last several orbits and the merger of neutron stars,
with matter described by a parametrized equation of state. Previous work
suggested the use of an effective cutoff frequency to place constraints on the
equation of state. We find, however, that greater accuracy is obtained by
measuring departures from the point-particle limit of the gravitational
waveform produced during the late inspiral.
  As the stars approach their final plunge and merger, the gravitational wave
phase accumulates more rapidly for smaller values of the neutron star
compactness (the ratio of the mass of the neutron star to its radius). We
estimate that realistic equations of state will lead to gravitational waveforms
that are distinguishable from point particle inspirals at an effective distance
(the distance to an optimally oriented and located system that would produce an
equivalent waveform amplitude) of 100 Mpc or less. As Lattimer and Prakash
observed, neutron-star radius is closely tied to the pressure at density not
far above nuclear. Our results suggest that broadband gravitational wave
observations at frequencies between 500 and 1000 Hz will constrain this
pressure, and we estimate the accuracy with which it can be measured. Related
first estimates of radius measurability show that the radius can be determined
to an accuracy of ~1 km at 100 Mpc.

between the interactions, as $J_-(t)\sim -|t/\tau|$. Here, time $t$ goes from
$-\infty$ to $+\infty$ and $\tau$ defines the rate of change of the
Hamiltonian. In other words, the spin chain initially prepared in its ground
state is driven by changing $J_-$ linearly in time up to the quantum critical
point, which in the model considered here occurs at at $t=0$, reversed and then
gradually decreased to its initial value at the same rate. We have thoroughly
compared the reverse quenching with its counterpart forward quenching $i.e.,$
$J_-\sim t/\tau$. Our exact calculation shows that the probability of
excitations is zero for the wave vector at which the instantaneous energy gap
is zero at the critical point $J_{-}=0$ as opposed to the maximum value of
unity in the forward quenching. It is also shown that the defect density in the
final state following a reverse quenching, we propose here, is nearly half of
the defects generated in the forward quenching. We argue that the defects
produced when the system reaches the quantum critical point gets redistributed
in the wave vector space at the final time in case of reverse quenching whereas
it keeps on increasing till the final time in the forward quenching. We study
the entropy density and also the time evolution of the diagonal entropy density
in the case of the reverse quenching and compare it with the forward case.

the recently reported very low value of $\sigma_8$ really is as derived from
the \textit{Chandra} Deep Field South (CDFS) using cosmic shear by taking the
non-Gaussianity of the likelihood into account as well as the possibility of
biases coming from the way the CDFS was selected.
  We find that the cosmic shear likelihood is significantly non-Gaussian. This
leads to both a shift of the maximum of the posterior distribution and a
significantly smaller credible region compared to the Gaussian case. We
re-analyse the CDFS cosmic shear data using the non-Gaussian likelihood.
Assuming that the CDFS is a random pointing, we find
$\sigma_8=0.68_{-0.16}^{+0.09}$ for fixed $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.25$. In a
WMAP5-like cosmology, a value equal to or lower than this would be expected in
$\approx 5%$ of the times. Taking biases into account arising from the way the
CDFS was selected, which we model as being dependent on the number of haloes in
the CDFS, we obtain $\sigma_8 = 0.71^{+0.10}_{-0.15}$. Combining the CDFS data
with the parameter constraints from WMAP5 yields $\Omega_{\rm m} =

surface above the convective core of a jovian planet, the coupling of the
gravitational and thermal tides vanishes to zeroth order in the ratio of the
atmospheric scale height to the planetary radius. At the next order, the effect
probably has the sign opposite to that claimed by the latter authors, hence

conductivity (SHC) ($\sigma_{xy}^z$) in Pd and Au metals has been performed. It
is found that at low temperatures, intrinsic SHCs for Pd and Au are,
respectively, $\sim 1400 (\hbar/e)(\Omega {\rm cm})^{-1}$ and $\sim 400
(\hbar/e)(\Omega {\rm cm})^{-1}$. The large SHC in Pd comes from the resonant
contribution from the spin-orbit splitting of the doubly degenerated 4$d$ bands
near the Fermi level at symmetry $\Gamma$ and X points, and the smaller SHC in
Au is due to the broad free electron like 6$s6p$-bands. However, as the
temperature increases, the SHC in Pd decreases monotonically and reduces to
$\sim 330 (\hbar/e)(\Omega {\rm cm})^{-1}$ at 300 K, while the SHC in Au
increases steadily and reaches $\sim 750 (\hbar/e)(\Omega {\rm cm})^{-1}$ at
room temperature. This indicates that the gigantic spin Hall effect

recently in the Au/FePt system [T. Seki, {\it et al.}, Nature Materials {\bf

broadening (and little mass shift) of the $\rho$ spectral function which
rapidly increases close to the expected phase boundary of hadronic and
quark-gluon matter. Pertinent dilepton rates appear to degenerate with
perturbative quark-antiquark annihilation in the Quark-Gluon Plasma, suggestive
for chiral symmetry restoration. Applications to low-mass dilepton spectra in
heavy-ion collisions result in quantitative agreement with recent high-quality
data at the CERN-SPS. Thermal radiation from temperatures around $T_c$
consistently reproduces the experimental dilepton excess observed at masses
above 1 GeV as well. The interpretation of dilepton sources at high transverse
