found for which spacetime is compactified on six-dimensional warped spaces. We
explicitly work out an example where the internal manifold is a six-dimensional
generalized space having positive, negative or zero scalar curvature, whose
base can be a five-sphere $S^5$ or an Einstein space $T^{1,1}=(S^2\times

just by solving the 10D vacuum Einstein equations. Our results further show
that the limitation with warped models studied to date has arisen partly from
an oversimplification of the 10D metric ansatz. We also give some explicit

takes into account the form of the BAO peak and the large scale shape of the

different combinations of datasets and for different parameter sets. When used
in combination with a compilation of the latest CMB measurements, the LRG
clustering and the latest supernovae results give constraints on cosmological
parameters which are comparable and in remarkably good agreement, resolving the
tension reported in some studies. The best fitting model in the context of a
flat, Lambda-CDM cosmology is specified by Omega_m=0.261+-0.013,
Omega_b=0.044+-0.001, n_s=0.96+-0.01, H_0=71.6+-1.2 km/s/Mpc and
sigma_8=0.80+-0.02. If we allow the time-independent dark energy equation of
state parameter to vary, we find results consistent with a cosmological
constant at the 5% level using all data sets: w_DE=-0.97+-0.05. The large scale
structure measurements by themselves can constrain the dark energy equation of
state parameter to w_DE=-1.05+-0.15, independently of CMB or supernovae data.
We do not find convincing evidence for an evolving equation of state. We
provide a set of ""extended distance priors"" that contain the most relevant
information from the CMB power spectrum and the shape of the LRG correlation
function which can be used to constrain dark energy models and spatial
curvature. Our model should provide an accurate description of the clustering
even in much larger, forthcoming surveys, such as those planned with NASA's

magnetic field and the shock normal. We find that only magnetic inclinations
corresponding to ""subluminal"" shocks, where relativistic particles following
the magnetic field can escape ahead of the shock, lead to particle
acceleration. The downstream spectrum in such shocks consists of a relativistic
Maxwellian and a high-energy power-law tail with exponential cutoff. For
increasing magnetic inclination in the subluminal range, the high-energy tail
accounts for an increasing fraction of particles (from ~1% to ~2%) and energy
(from ~4% to ~12%). The spectral index of the power law increases with angle
from -2.8+-0.1 to -2.3+-0.1. Particle energization is driven by the Diffusive
Shock Acceleration process for nearly parallel shocks, and switches to
Shock-Drift Acceleration for larger subluminal inclinations. For ""superluminal""
shocks, the downstream particle spectrum does not show any significant
suprathermal tail. As seen from the upstream frame, efficient acceleration in
relativistic (Lorentz factor gamma0 > 5) magnetized (sigma > 0.03) flows exists
only for a very small range of magnetic inclination angles (< 34/gamma0
degrees), so relativistic astrophysical pair shocks have to be either nearly
parallel or weakly magnetized to generate nonthermal particles. These findings
place constraints on the models of AGN jets, Pulsar Wind Nebulae and Gamma Ray
Bursts that invoke particle acceleration in relativistic magnetized shocks.

the BaFe$_2$As$_2$ cleavage surface provides an electrostatic environment that
is slightly different to the bulk, most likely in the form of a modified
Madelung potential. However, as the data argue against a different surface
doping level, and the surface-related features in the spectra are by no means
as dominating as seen in systems such as YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_x$, we can conclude
that the itinerant, near-E$_F$ electronic states are almost unaffected by the
existence of the cleavage surface. Furthermore, exploiting the strong changes
in photoionisation cross section between the Fe and As states across the wide
photon energy range employed, it is shown that the degree of energetic overlap
between the iron 3d and arsenic 4p valence bands is particularly small at the
Fermi level, which can only mean a very low degree of hybridization between the
Fe 3d and As 4p states near and at E$_F$. Consequently, the itinerancy of the
charge carriers in this group of materials involves mainly the Fe 3d - Fe 3d
overlap integrals with at best a minor role for the Fe 3d - As 4p hopping

radio continuum observations at 6 and 20 cm are presented. We detect prominent
extraplanar emission to the west of the galactic center, which extends twice as
far as the other tracers of extraplanar material. The spectral index of the
extraplanar emission does not steepen with increasing distance from the galaxy.
This implies in situ re-acceleration of relativistic electrons. The comparison
with multiwavelength observations shows that the magnetic field and the warm
ionized interstellar medium traced by Halpha emission are closely linked. The
kinematics of the northern extraplanar Halpha emission, which is ascribed to
star formation, follow those of the extraplanar CO emission. In the western and
southern extraplanar regions, the Halpha measured velocities are greater than
those of the CO lines. We suggest that the ionized gas of this region is
excited by ram pressure. The spatial and velocity offsets are consistent with a
scenario where the diffuse ionized gas is more efficiently pushed by ram
pressure stripping than the neutral gas. We suggest that the recently found
radio-deficient regions compared to 24 mum emission are due to this difference

nonlinearity is revisited. A self-contained quasicontinuum approximation is
developed to derive closed-form expressions for small-amplitude solitary waves.
The notion that the existence of nonlinear solitary waves is a signature of the
modulation instability is used to analytically study instability effects on
solitons during propagation. In particular, we concern with instability effects
in the dark region, where other analytical methods as the standard modulation
analysis of planewaves do not provide any information on solitons. The region
of high-velocity solitons is studied anew showing that solitons are less prone
to intabilities in this region. An analytical upper boundary for the
self-defocusing instability is defined.

some new physics to be able to fully address the problem. The article then
exposes one avenue that has been used to address the central issue and
elaborates on the degree to which, the new approach makes different predictions

that Quantum Gravity might lead to a real, dynamical collapse of the wave

the methane molecules are either in contact or at separations corresponding to
the diameter and the length of the cylindrical pore. Analytic calculations that
estimate the entropy of the solutes, which are solvated at the pore surface,
qualitatively explain the shape of the free energy profiles. Adding charges of
opposite sign and magnitude $0.4e$ or $e$ (where $e$ is the electronic charge)

restores the SSM. We show that confinement induced ion-pair formation occurs
whenever $l_B/D \sim O(1)$, where $l_B$ is the Bjerrum length, and $D$ is the
pore diameter. The extent of stabilization of the SSM increases with ion charge
density as long as $l_B/D < 1$. In pores with $D \le 1.2$ nm, in which the
water is strongly layered, increasing the charge magnitude from $0.4e$ to $e$
reduces the stability of the SSM. As a result, ion-pair formation which occurs
with negligible probability in the bulk, is promoted. In larger diameter pores
that can accomodate a complete hydration layer around the solutes, the
stability of the SSM is enhanced.

time-bounded algorithmic entropy (where the alloted time is $nt(n)\log

(CRRs) is essential for precision of gene expression in development and other

between TFs, thus constraining the arrangement of TFs sites in a CRR. On the
contrary, genomic and functional studies demonstrate a great deal of
flexibility in such arrangements with variable distances, numbers of sites, and
identities of the involved TFs. Such flexibility is inconsistent with the
cooperativity by direct interactions between TFs. Here we demonstrate that
strong cooperativity among non-interacting TFs can be achieved by their
competition with nucleosomes. We find that the mechanism of nucleosome-mediated
cooperativity is mathematically identical to the Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC)
model of cooperativity in hemoglobin. This surprising parallel provides deep
insights, with parallels between heterotropic regulation of hemoglobin (e.g.
Bohr effect) and roles of nucleosome-positioning sequences and chromatin
modifications in gene regulation. Characterized mechanism is consistent with
numerous experimental results, allows substantial flexibility in and modularity
of CRRs, and provides a rationale for a broad range of genomic and evolutionary

system differs from the classical case in that the sender and receiver spin
states are quantum superposition states coupled by a Hamiltonian operator. A
basic understanding of these states is directly relevant to communications
theory and indirectly relevant to computation since the product states form a
basis for entangled states. Highlights of the study include an exact method for
decimation for quantum spins. The main result is that the minimum Gibbs free
energy of the quantum system in the product state is higher (lower capacity)
than a classical system with the same parameter values. The result is both
surprising and not. The channel characteristics of the quantum system in the
product state are markedly inferior to those of the classical Ising system.
Intuitively, it would seem that capacity should suffer as a result. Yet, one
would expect entangled states, built from product states, to have better
correlation properties.

static properties of simple fluids under confinement, a theory of comparative
accuracy for the transport coefficients has yet to emerge. Nonetheless, there
is evidence that knowledge of how confinement modifies static behavior can aid
in forecasting dynamics. Specifically, molecular simulation studies have shown
that the relationship between excess entropy and self diffusivity of a bulk
equilibrium fluid changes only modestly when the fluid is isothermally
confined, indicating that knowledge of the former might allow semi-quantitative
predictions of the latter. Do other static measures, such as those that
characterize free or available volume, also strongly correlate with
single-particle dynamics of confined fluids? Here, we study this issue for both
the single-component hard-sphere fluid and hard-sphere mixtures. Specifically,
we use molecular simulations and fundamental measure theory to study these
systems at approximately $10^3$ equilibrium state points. We examine three
different confining geometries (slit pore, square channel, and cylindrical
pore) and the effects of packing fraction and particle-boundary interactions.
Although density fails to predict some key qualitative trends for the dynamics
of confined fluids, we find that a new generalized measure of available volume
for inhomogeneous fluids strongly correlates with the self diffusivity across a
wide parameter space in these systems, approximately independent of the degree
of confinement. An important consequence, which we demonstrate here, is that
density functional theory predictions of this static property can be used
together with knowledge of bulk fluid behavior to estimate the diffusion
coefficient of confined fluids under equilibrium conditions.

characterise the evolution of languages and competition amongst them. In terms
of language usage, one of the most influential results is Zipf's law of word

human language. However, there is ongoing controversy over whether Zipf's law
is a good indicator of complexity. Here we present an alternative approach that
puts Zipf's law in the context of critical phenomena (the cornerstone of
complexity in physics) and establishes the presence of a large scale
""attraction"" between successive repetitions of words. Moreover, this phenomenon
is scale-invariant and universal -- the pattern is independent of word
frequency and is observed in texts by different authors and written in
different languages. There is evidence, however, that the shape of the scaling
relation changes for words that play a key role in the text, implying the
existence of different ""universality classes"" in the repetition of words. These
behaviours exhibit striking parallels with complex catastrophic phenomena.

systems hosting energetic starburst and AGN activity. SMGs may represent a
rapid growth phase that every massive galaxy undergoes before lying on the
well-established black-hole-spheroid mass relationship in the local Universe.
Here we briefly discuss our recent results from Alexander et al. (2008) where
we estimated the masses of the black holes in SMGs using the black-hole virial
mass estimator, finding M_BH~6x10^7 M_solar for typical SMGs. We show that the
black-hole-spheroid mass ratio for SMGs at z~2 was suggestively below that
found for massive galaxies in the local Universe and more than an order of
magnitude below the black-hole-spheroid mass ratio estimated for z~2 quasars
and radio galaxies. We demonstrate that SMGs and their progeny cannot lie on
the elevated z~2 black-hole-spheroid mass relationship of quasars-radio
galaxies without overproducing the space density of the most massive black
holes (M_BH~10^9 M_solar), unless the galaxy spheroid of SMGs is an order of
magnitude lower than that typically assumed (M_SPH~10^10 M_solar). We also show
that the relative black-hole-spheroid growth rates of typical SMGs appear to be
insufficient to significantly increase the black-hole-spheroid mass ratio,
without requiring long duty cycles (~10^9 years), and argue that a more
AGN-dominated phase (e.g., an optically bright quasar) is required to
significantly move SMGs (and their progeny) up the black-hole-spheroid mass
plane.

J033115.0-275518, at z=1.369. A Keck/DEIMOS spectrum shows a clearly
double-peaked broad Mg II $\lambda2799$ emission line, with FWHM 11000 km/s for
the line complex. The line profile can be well fit by an elliptical
relativistic Keplerian disk model. This is one of a handful of double-peaked
emitters known to be a luminous quasar, with excellent multiwavelength coverage
and a high-quality X-ray spectrum. CXOECDFS J033115.0-275518 is a radio-loud
quasar with two radio lobes (FR II morphology) and a radio loudness of f_{5
GHz}/f_{4400 \AA}~429. The X-ray spectrum can be modeled by a power law with
photon index 1.72 and no intrinsic absorption; the rest-frame 0.5-8.0 keV
luminosity is $5.0\times10^{44}$ erg/s. The spectral energy distribution (SED)
of CXOECDFS J033115.0-275518 has a shape typical for radio-loud quasars and
double-peaked emitters at lower redshift. The local viscous energy released
from the line-emitting region of the accretion disk is probably insufficient to
power the observed line flux, and external illumination of the disk appears to
be required. The presence of a big blue bump in the SED along with the
unexceptional X-ray spectrum suggest that the illumination cannot arise from a
radiatively inefficient accretion flow.

[O III] emission. These observations were obtained in conjunction with the Keck
laser guide star adaptive optics system, with a typical angular resolution
after spatial smoothing ~ 0.15"" (approximately 1 kpc at the redshift of the
target sample). At most five of these 13 galaxies have spatially resolved
velocity gradients consistent with rotation while the remaining galaxies have
relatively featureless or irregular velocity fields. All of our galaxies show
local velocity dispersions ~ 60 - 100 km/s, suggesting that (particularly for
those galaxies with featureless velocity fields) rotation about a preferred
axis may not be the dominant mechanism of physical support. While some galaxies
show evidence for major mergers such evidence is unrelated to the kinematics of
individual components (one of our strongest merger candidates also exhibits
unambiguous rotational structure), refuting a simple bimodal disk/merger
classification scheme. We discuss these data in light of complementary surveys
and extant UV-IR spectroscopy and photometry, concluding that the dynamical
importance of cold gas may be the primary factor governing the observed
kinematics of z ~ 2 galaxies. We conclude by speculating on the importance of
mechanisms for accreting low angular-momentum gas and the early formation of
quasi-spheroidal systems in the young universe.(abridged)

some selection criteria. First, even with fixed accretion physics, AGN are
diluted/less luminous relative to their hosts; the magnitude of this depends on
host properties and so on luminosity and redshift. Second, they may transition
to a radiatively inefficient state, changing SED shape and dramatically
decreasing in optical/IR luminosity. These effects lead to differences in
observed AGN samples, even at fixed bolometric luminosity and after correction
for obscuration. The true Eddington ratio distribution may depend strongly on
luminosity, but this will be seen only in surveys robust to dilution and
radiative inefficiency (X-ray or narrow-line samples); selection effects imply
that AGN in optical samples will have uniformly high mdot. This also implies
that different selection methods yield systems with different hosts: the
clustering of faint optical/IR sources will be weaker than that of X-ray
sources, and optical/IR Seyferts will reside in more disk-dominated galaxies
while X-ray selected Seyferts will preferentially occupy early-type systems. If
observed mdot distributions are correct, a large fraction of low-luminosity AGN
currently classified as 'obscured' are in fact diluted and/or radiatively
inefficient, not obscured by gas or dust. This is equally true if X-ray
hardness is used as a proxy for obscuration, since radiatively inefficient SEDs
near mdot~0.01 are X-ray hard. These effects can explain most of the claimed
luminosity/redshift dependence in the 'obscured' AGN population, with the true
obscured fraction as low as 20%.

direct detection experiments. To date, such predictions have been based on
simulations that model the dark matter alone. Here we include the influence of
the baryonic matter for the first time. We use two different approaches.
Firstly, we use dark matter only simulations to estimate the expected merger
history for a Milky Way mass galaxy, and then add a thin stellar disc to
measure its effect. Secondly, we use three cosmological hydrodynamic
simulations of Milky Way mass galaxies. In both cases, we find that a
stellar/gas disc at high redshift (z~1) causes merging satellites to be
preferentially dragged towards the disc plane. This results in an accreted dark
matter disc that contributes ~0.25 - 1 times the non-rotating halo density at
the solar position. An associated thick stellar disc forms with the dark disc
and shares a similar velocity distribution. If these accreted stars can be
separated from those that formed in situ, future astronomical surveys will be
able to infer the properties of the dark disc from these stars. The dark disc,
unlike dark matter streams, is an equilibrium structure that must exist in disc
galaxies that form in a hierarchical cosmology. Its low rotation lag with
respect to the Earth significantly boosts WIMP capture in the Earth and Sun,
increases the likelihood of direct detection at low recoil energy, boosts the
annual modulation signal, and leads to distinct variations in the flux as a
function of recoil energy that allow the WIMP mass to be determined (see
contribution from T. Bruch this volume).

Convection leads to an order of magnitude uncertainty in the yield of charged

antiprotons, but the rise in the positron fraction, as observed by PAMELA, is
incompatible with DMA, if compared with the EGRET excess. A rise in the

ability to measure the characteristics of detected sources. It also increases
the number of weak signals that contribute to the data. Because GW detectors
have nearly all-sky sensitivity, they can be subject to a confusion limit: Many
sources which cannot be distinguished may be measured simultaneously, defining
a stochastic noise floor to the sensitivity. For GW detectors operating at
present and for their planned upgrades, the projected event rate is
sufficiently low that we are far from the confusion-limited regime. However,
some detectors currently under discussion may have large enough reach to binary
inspiral that they enter the confusion-limited regime. In this paper, we
examine the binary inspiral confusion limit for terrestrial detectors. We
consider a broad range of inspiral rates in the literature, several planned
advanced gravitational-wave detectors, and the highly advanced ""Einstein
Telescope"" design. Though most advanced detectors will not be impacted by this
limit, the Einstein Telescope with a very low frequency ""seismic wall"" may be
subject to confusion noise. At a minimum, careful data analysis will be require
to separate signals which will appear confused. This result should be borne in
mind when designing highly advanced future instruments.

molecular strands (such as DNA) modeled as flexible continuous filamentary
distributions of interacting rigid charge conformations. The new feature is
that the equations of motion for the dynamics of such molecular strands are
nonlocal when the screened Coulomb interactions, or Lennard-Jones potentials
between pairs of charges are included. These nonlocal dynamical equations are
derived in the convective representation of continuum motion by using modified
Euler-Poincare and Hamilton-Pontryagin variational formulations that illuminate
the various approaches within the framework of symmetry reduction of Hamilton's
principle for exact geometric rods. In the absence of nonlocal interactions,
the equations recover the classical Kirchhoff theory of elastic rods in the
spatial representation. The motion equations in the convective representation
are shown to be affine Euler-Poincare equations relative to a certain cocycle.
This property relates the geometry of the molecular strands to that of complex
fluids. An elegant change of variables allows a direct passage from the
infinite dimensional point of view to the covariant formulation in terms of
Lagrange-Poincare equations. In another revealing perspective, the convective
representation of the nonlocal equations of molecular strand motion is
transformed into quaternionic form.

nonzero absorptive parts in scattering amplitudes. By constructing suitable
parton states with massless partons we derive the two factorizations for the

Together with the time-dependent dynamics of the cocoon expansion, we find that
young cocoons can yield thermal Bremsstrahlung emissions at energies $\sim$MeV.
Hotter cocoons (i.e., GeV) for younger sources are also discussed.

a small excitation energy region with negative heat capacity. In contrast to
previous statistical calculations, this situation takes place even in this case

introduced to give a more precise description of computed chaotic solutions of
nonlinear differential equations: it is suggested that computed chaotic
solutions are unreliable and doubtable when $ t > T_c$. This provides us a
strategy to detect reliable solution from a given computed result. In this way,
the computational phenomena, such as computational chaos (CC), computational
periodicity (CP) and computational prediction uncertainty, which are mainly
based on long-term properties of computed time series, can be completely
avoided. So, this concept also provides us a time-scale to determine whether or
not a particular time is long enough for a given nonlinear dynamic system.
Besides, the influence of data inaccuracy and various numerical schemes on the
critical predictable time is investigated in details by using symbolic
computation software as a tool. A reliable chaotic solution of Lorenz equation
in a rather large interval $0 \leq t < 1200$ non-dimensional Lorenz time units
is obtained for the first time. It is found that the precision of initial
condition and computed data at each time-step, which is mathematically
necessary to get such a reliable chaotic solution in such a long time, is so
high that it is physically impossible due to the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle in quantum physics. This however provides us a so-called ""precision
paradox of chaos"", which suggests that the prediction uncertainty of chaos is
physically unavoidable, and that even the macroscopical phenomena might be
essentially stochastic and thus could be described by probability more
economically.

and how it relates to known entropies such as the thermodynamic entropy and the
information entropy. Next, we show that Skilling's method of induction leads us
to a unique general theory of inductive inference, the ME method and precisely
how it is that other entropies such as those of Renyi or Tsallis are ruled out
for problems of inference. We then explore the compatibility of Bayes and ME
updating. We show that ME is capable of producing every aspect of orthodox
Bayesian inference and proves the complete compatibility of Bayesian and
entropy methods. The realization that the ME method incorporates Bayes' rule as
a special case allows us to go beyond Bayes' rule and to process both data and
expected value constraints simultaneously. We discuss the general problem of
non-commuting constraints, when they should be processed sequentially and when
simultaneously. The generic ""canonical"" form of the posterior distribution for
the problem of simultaneous updating with data and moments is obtained. This is
a major achievement since it shows that ME is not only capable of processing
information in the form of constraints, like MaxEnt and information in the form
of data, as in Bayes' Theorem, but also can process both forms simultaneously,
which Bayes and MaxEnt cannot do alone. Finally, we illustrate some potential
applications for this new method by applying ME to potential problems of

components of dust distributions are needed to explain the time lags derived by
the cross-correlation method. Assuming the distance as 1.7 kpc for Cygnus OB2
association (a richest OB association in the local Galaxy) and another uniform
dust distribution, we get a distance of $7.2^{+0.3}_{-0.5}$ kpc (68$%$
confidence level) for Cyg X-3. When using the distance estimation of Cygnus OB2
as 1.38 kpc or 1.82 kpc, the inferred distance for Cyg X-3 is
$3.4^{+0.2}_{-0.2}$ kpc or $9.3^{+0.6}_{-0.4}$ kpc respectively. The distance
estimation uncertainty of Cyg X-3 is mainly related to the distance of the
Cygnus OB2, which may be improved in the future with high precision astrometric
measurements. The advantage of this method is that the result depends weakly on
the photon energy, dust grain radius, scattering cross-section and so on.

surrounding accretion disc based on large-scale magnetic field. The MC gives
rise to transport of energy and angular momentum between the black hole and the
disc, and the closed field lines pipe the hot matter evaporated from the disc,
and shape it in the corona above the disc to form a magnetically induced
disc-corona system, in which the corona has the same configuration as the
large-scale magnetic field. We numerically solve the dynamic equations in the
context of the Kerr metric, in which the large-scale magnetic field is
determined by dynamo process and equipartition between magnetic pressure and
gas pressure. Thus we can obtain a global solution rather than assuming the
distribution of large-scale magnetic field beforehand. The main MC effects lie
in three aspects. (1) The rotational energy of a fast-spinning black hole can
be extracted, enhancing the dissipation in the accretion disc, (2) the closed
field lines provide a natural channel for corona matter escaping from disc and
finally falling into black hole, and (3) the scope of the corona can be bounded
by the conservation of magnetic flux. We simulate the high-energy spectra of
this system by using Monte-Carlo method, and find that the relative hardness of
the spectra decreases as accretion rate or black hole spin $a_*$ increases. We
fit the typical X-ray spectra of three black-hole binaries (GRO J1655-40, XTE

deflagration leads to the pulsation of a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf,
followed by formation of an accretion shock around a carbon-oxygen rich core.
The accretion shock confines the core and transforms kinetic energy from the

ignition for different PRD models characterized by the amount of mass burned

the formation of the accretion shock has been followed with a three-dimensional
hydrodynamical code with nuclear reactions turned off. We found that detonation
conditions are achieved for a wide range of M_defl. However, if the nuclear
energy released during the deflagration phase is close to the white dwarf
binding energy (~ 0.46 foes -> M_defl ~ 0.30 M_sun) the accretion shock cannot
heat and confine efficiently the core and detonation conditions are not
robustly achieved.

Effect (EFE) because the solar system is embedded in the Milky Way. In the
framework of MOND this does matter since the gravitational acceleration of
Galactic origin felt by the solar system is of the same order of magnitude of
the characteristic MOND acceleration scale A_0\approx 10^-10 m s^-2. We use
three different forms of the MOND interpolating function \mu(x) and two
different values for the Galactic field at the Sun's location. We find that
MOND produces highly distorted trajectories with respect to the Newtonian case,
especially for very eccentric orbits. It turns out that the shape of the MOND
orbits strongly depend on the initial conditions. For particular initial state
vectors, the MOND paths in the ecliptic plane get shrunk extending over much
smaller spatial regions than in the Newtonian case, and experience high
frequency variations over one Keplerian orbital period. Ecliptic orbits with
different initial conditions and nearly polar orbits are quite different
getting distorted as well, but they occupy more extended spatial regions. This
facts may have consequences on the composition and the dynamical history of the

world. The small size of the corpus, the absence of bilingual texts, and the
lack of definite knowledge of the underlying language has frustrated efforts at
decipherment since the discovery of the remains of the Indus civilisation.
Recently, some researchers have questioned the premise that the Indus script
encodes spoken language. Building on previous statistical approaches, we apply
the tools of statistical language processing, specifically $n$-gram Markov
chains, to analyse the Indus script for syntax. Our main results are that the
script has well-defined signs which begin and end texts, that there is
directionality and strong correlations in the sign order, and that there are
groups of signs which appear to have identical syntactic function. All these
require no {\it a priori} suppositions regarding the syntactic or semantic
content of the signs, but follow directly from the statistical analysis. Using
information theoretic measures, we find the information in the script to be
intermediate between that of a completely random and a completely fixed
ordering of signs. Our study reveals that the Indus script is a structured sign
system showing features of a formal language, but, at present, cannot
conclusively establish that it encodes {\it natural} language. Our $n$-gram
Markov model is useful for predicting signs which are missing or illegible in a
corpus of Indus texts. This work forms the basis for the development of a
stochastic grammar which can be used to explore the syntax of the Indus script
in greater detail.

this self-sustained neural activity, and its interplay with the sensory data
input stream, is an important question in cognitive system research and we
review here the present state of theoretical modelling.
  This review will start with a brief overview of the experimental efforts,
together with a discussion of transient vs. self-sustained neural activity in
the framework of reservoir computing. The main emphasis will be then on two
paradigmal neural network architectures showing continuously ongoing
transient-state dynamics: saddle point networks and networks of attractor
relics.
  Self-active neural networks are confronted with two seemingly contrasting
demands: a stable internal dynamical state and sensitivity to incoming stimuli.
We show, that this dilemma can be solved by networks of attractor relics based
on competitive neural dynamics, where the attractor relics compete on one side
with each other for transient dominance, and on the other side with the
dynamical influence of the input signals. Unsupervised and local Hebbian-style
online learning then allows the system to build up correlations between the
internal dynamical transient states and the sensory input stream. An emergent
cognitive capability results from this set-up. The system performs online, and
on its own, a non-linear independent component analysis of the sensory data
stream, all the time being continuously and autonomously active. This process
maps the independent components of the sensory input onto the attractor relics,
which acquire in this way a semantic meaning.

surprising prediction. Dijet production in hadron-hadron collisions provides
the paradigm, i.e. h_1 +h_2 \to jj+X. In particular, we look at the case where
there is a restriction placed on the emission of any further jets in the region
in between the primary (highest p_T) dijets. Logarithms in the ratio of the jet
scale to the veto scale can be summed to all orders in the strong coupling.
Surprisingly, factorization of collinear emissions fails at scales above the
veto scale and triggers the appearance of double logarithms in the hard
sub-process. The effect appears first at fourth order relative to the leading
order prediction and is subleading in the number of colours.

as a galaxy distribution for further processing with Fast Fourier techniques.
Discretizing, in particular representing continuous signals by discrete sets of
sample points, introduces an enormous loss of information, which has to be
understood in detail if one wants to make inference from the discretely sampled
signal towards actual natural physical quantities. We therefore review the
mathematics of discretizing signals and the application of Fast Fourier
Transforms to demonstrate how the interpretation of the processed data can be
affected by these procedures. It is also a well known fact that any practical
sampling method introduces sampling artifacts and false information in the form
of aliasing. These sampling artifacts, especially aliasing, make further
processing of the sampled signal difficult. For this reason we introduce a fast
and efficient supersampling method, frequently applied in 3D computer graphics,
to cosmological applications such as matter power spectrum estimation. This
method consists of two filtering steps which allow for a much better
approximation of the ideal sampling procedure, while at the same time being
computationally very efficient.Thus, it provides discretely sampled signals
which are greately cleaned from aliasing contributions.

orbifold (which are far from unique) with Abelian gauge fluxes. These gauge
backgrounds are topologically characterized by weight vectors of twisted

the blowup from the orbifold perspective, and they reappear as axions on the

contain the MSSM particle spectrum, the hypercharge turns out to be anomalous:
Since all heterotic MSSM orbifolds analyzed so far have fixed points where only
SM charged states appear, its gauge group can only be preserved provided that
those singularities are not blown up. Going beyond the comparison of purely
topological quantities (e.g. anomalous U(1) masses) may be hampered by the fact
that in the orbifold limit the supergravity approximation to lowest order in

of the speed of light c, with the meaning of space-time structure constant
c_ST, assumed to be linear over timescales of about one century, would induce a
secular precession of the longitude of the pericenter \varpi of a test particle
orbiting a spherically symmetric body. By comparing such a predicted effect to
the corrections \Delta\dot\varpi to the usual Newtonian/Einsteinian perihelion
precessions of the inner planets of the Solar System, recently estimated by
E.V. Pitjeva by fitting about one century of modern astronomical observations
with the standard dynamical force models of the EPM epehemerides, we obtained
\dot c/c =(0.5 +/- 2)\times 10^-7 yr^-1. Moreover, the possibility that \dot
c/c\neq 0 over the last century is ruled out at 3-12\sigma level by taking the
ratios of the perihelia for different pairs of planets. Our results are
independent of any measurement of the variations of other fundamental constants
which may be explained by a variation of $c$ itself (with the meaning of
electromagnetic constant c_EM). It will be important to repeat such tests if
and when other teams of astronomers will estimate their own corrections to the
standard Newtonian/Einsteinian planetary perihelion precessions.

dominant after the transition. We note that a qualitatively similar behavior
has been recently reported in several neutron star sources by Torok (2008,

that the extra-dimension and its nontrivial curvature can largely change the

the HLS approach, the rho-meson field as a massive Yang-Mills field has a
singular configuration in Skyrmion, which gives a strong repulsion for the
baryon as a stabilizer. When a_1 meson is added in this approach, the stability
of Skyrmion is lost by the cancellation of rho and a_1 contributions. On the

show that the rho-meson field has a regular configuration in Skyrmion, which
gives a weak attraction for the baryon in holographic QCD. We argue that
Skyrmion with pi, rho and a_1 mesons become stable due to the curved
extra-dimension and also the presence of the Skyrme term in holographic QCD.
