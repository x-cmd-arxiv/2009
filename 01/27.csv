critical exponent equal to z=3 in the UV. (As in condensed matter systems, z
measures the degree of anisotropy between space and time.) This theory, which
at short distances describes interacting nonrelativistic gravitons, is
power-counting renormalizable in 3+1 dimensions. When restricted to satisfy the
condition of detailed balance, this theory is intimately related to
topologically massive gravity in three dimensions, and the geometry of the
Cotton tensor. At long distances, this theory flows naturally to the
relativistic value z=1, and could therefore serve as a possible candidate for a
UV completion of Einstein's general relativity or an infrared modification
thereof. The effective speed of light, the Newton constant and the cosmological
constant all emerge from relevant deformations of the deeply nonrelativistic
z=3 theory at short distances.

present a new prediction of angularity distributions in e+e- annihilation.
Angularities tau_a are an infinite class of event shapes which vary in their
sensitivity to the substructure of jets in the final state, controlled by a
continuous parameter a<2. We calculate angularity distributions for all a<1 to
first order in the strong coupling alpha_s and resum large logarithms in these

parameter which cancels the renormalon ambiguity in the partonic soft function.
We explore the relation between the SCET approach to resummation and past
approaches in QCD, and discuss the advantages of the effective theory approach.
In addition, we draw from the NLO calculations of the jet and soft functions an
intuitive lesson about how factorization breaks down in the effective theory as

leads to higher elliptic flow values. In contrast to previous studies within
pure hydrodynamics, the more realistic initial conditions employed here and the

are in line with the experimental data almost over the whole energy range from
$E_{\rm lab}=2-160A $GeV. Thus, this new approach leads to a substantially
different shape of the $v_2/\epsilon$ scaling curve as a function of $(1/S

plasma depends on the horizon value of the effective coupling of transverse
graviton moving in black hole background. The proof for the above statement is
based on the canonical form of graviton's action. But in presence of generic
higher derivative terms in the bulk Lagrangian the action is no longer
canonical. We give a procedure to find an effective action for graviton (to
first order in coefficient of higher derivative term) in canonical form in
presence of any arbitrary higher derivative terms in the bulk. From that
effective action we find the effective coupling constant for transverse
graviton which in general depends on the radial coordinate $r$. We also argue
that horizon value of this effective coupling is related to the shear viscosity
coefficient of the boundary fluid in higher derivative gravity. We explicitly
check this procedure for two specific examples: (1) four derivative action and

nonparametric spectral estimation methods to extract information on

Because the EEGs may become nonstationary before seizure events, we develop
methods for both stationary and local stationary processes. Based on penalized
Whittle likelihood, we propose a direct generalized maximum likelihood (GML)
and generalized approximate cross-validation (GACV) methods to estimate
smoothing parameters in both smoothing spline spectrum estimation of a
stationary process and smoothing spline ANOVA time-varying spectrum estimation
of a locally stationary process. We also propose permutation methods to test if
a locally stationary process is stationary. Extensive simulations indicate that
the proposed direct methods, especially the direct GML, are stable and perform
better than other existing methods. We apply the proposed methods to the
intracranial electroencephalograms (IEEGs) of an epileptic patient to gain

groups and their 2-characters, as well as on pivotal structures for fusion
categories. The motivation is extended topological quantum field theory (TQFT),
where the 2-category of unitary 2-representations of a finite group is thought
of as the `2-category assigned to the point' in the untwisted finite group
model.
  The first result is that the braided monoidal category of transformations of
the identity on the 2-category of unitary 2-representations of a finite group
computes as the category of conjugation equivariant vector bundles over the
group equipped with the fusion tensor product. This result is consistent with
the extended TQFT hypotheses of Baez and Dolan, since it establishes that the
category assigned to the circle can be obtained as the `higher trace of the
identity' of the 2-category assigned to the point.
  The second result is about 2-characters of 2-representations, a concept which
has been introduced independently by Ganter and Kapranov. It is shown that the
2-character of a unitary 2-representation can be made functorial with respect
to morphisms of 2-representations, and that in fact the 2-character is a
unitarily fully faithful functor from the complexified Grothendieck category of
unitary 2-representations to the category of unitary equivariant vector bundles
over the group.
  The final result is about pivotal structures on fusion categories, with a
view towards a conjecture made by Etingof, Nikshych and Ostrik. It is shown
that a pivotal structure on a fusion category cannot exist unless certain
involutions on the hom-sets are plus or minus the identity map, in which case a
pivotal structure is the same thing as a twisted monoidal natural
transformation of the identity functor on the category. Moreover the pivotal
structure can be made spherical if and only if these signs can be removed.

number B, and for arbitrary quark mass m and volume L. We fully treat the
dynamics of the gluonic zero modes and check how this affects results from
previous studies of the B=0 and B=1 systems. For a finite density of baryons,
and for any m>0, we find that the ground state contains a baryon crystal with
expectation values for psi-bar gamma_mu psi that have a helix-like spatial
structure. We study how these evolve with B and see that the volume integral of
psi-bar psi strongly changes with the baryon density. We compare this emerging
crystal structure with the sine-Gordon crystal, which is expected to be a good
approximation for light quarks, and find that it is a very good approximation
for surprisingly heavy quarks. We also calculate the way the ground state
energy E changes as a function of the baryon number B, and find that for
sufficiently large densities the function E(B) is well described by the
equation of state for free massless quarks, thus suggesting a quark-Hadron
continuity. From dE(B)/dB we calculate the quark chemical potential mu as a
function of B and see that the baryons repel each other. The way mu depends on
B also allows us to translate our findings to the grand-canonical ensemble. The
resulting phase structure along the mu-axis contains a phase transition that
occurs at a value of mu equal to the baryon mass divided in N, and that
separates a mu-independent phase with intact translation symmetry from a
mu-dependent phase with spontaneously broken translation symmetry. Finally, our
calculations confirm the presence of a partial large-N Eguchi-Kawai volume
independence, as described in Phys.Rev.D79:105021, that arises only if one
treats the gluonic zero modes correctly.

the distance to the next unvisited target (cost) and on the weight of that

test the robustness of the model and argue that the addition of noise has a
limited impact on the dynamics in strongly disordered media.

GRBs within them. Multiwavelength observations of GRB afterglows provide useful
information on the emission mechanisms at work. These are all key issues that
allow one to discriminate among different models of these elusive events. We
carried out photometric observations of the short/hard GRB 051227, GRB 061006,

down to the host galaxy level several days later. For GRB 061006 and GRB 071227
we also obtained spectroscopic observations of the host galaxy. We compared the
results obtained from our optical observations with the available X-ray data of
these bursts. For all the three above bursts, we discovered optical afterglows
and firmly identified their host galaxies. About half a day after the burst,
the optical afterglows of GRB 051227 and GRB 061006 present a decay
significatly steeper than in the X-rays. In the case of GRB 051227, the optical
decay is so steep that it likely indicates different emission mechanisms in the
two wavelengths ranges. The three hosts are blue, star forming galaxies at
moderate redshifts and with metallicities comparable to the Solar one. The
projected offsets of the optical afterglows from their host galaxies centers
span a wide range, but all afterglows lie within the light of their hosts and
present evidence for local absorption in their X-ray spectra. We discuss our
findings in light of the current models of short GRB progenitors.

for systems out of Onsager's region. This theory is referred to as the
""Thermodynamic Field Theory"" (TFT). The aim of the work was to determine the
nonlinear flux-force relations that respect the thermodynamic theorems for
systems far from equilibrium. We propose a new formulation of the TFT where one
of the basic restrictions, namely the closed-form solution for the
skew-symmetric piece of the transport coefficients, has been removed. In
addition, the general covariance principle is replaced by the De
Donder-Prigogine thermodynamic covariance principle (TCP). The introduction of
TCP requires the application of an appropriate mathematical formalism, which is
referred to as the ""entropy-covariant formalism"". By geometrical arguments, we
prove the validity of the Glansdorff-Prigogine Universal Criterion of
Evolution. A new set of closure equations determining the nonlinear corrections
to the linear (""Onsager"") transport coefficients is also derived. The geometry
of the thermodynamic space is non-Riemannian. However, it tends to be
Riemannian for high values of the entropy production. In this limit, we recover
the transport equations found by the old theory. Applications of our approach
to transport in magnetically confined plasmas, materials submitted to
temperature and electric potential gradients or to unimolecular triangular
chemical reactions can be found at references cited herein. Transport processes
in tokamak plasmas are of particular interest. In this case, even in absence of
turbulence, the state of the plasma remains close to (but, it is not in) a
state of local equilibrium. This prevents the transport relations from being
linear.

departure from Gaussianity and leave a testable imprint on the higher order
correlations of the CMB and large scale structures in the Universe. We focus on
the bispectrum statistics of the primordial curvature perturbation and its
projection on the CMB. For a canonical single-field action the three-point
correlator enhancement is localized, maximizing in the collinear limit,
corresponding to enfolded or squashed triangles in comoving momentum space. We
show that the available local and equilateral template are very insensitive to
this localized enhancement and do not generate noteworthy constraints on
initial-state modifications. On the other hand, when considering the addition
of a dimension 8 higher order derivative term, we find a dominant rapidly
oscillating contribution, which had previously been overlooked and whose
significantly enhanced amplitude is independent of the triangle under
consideration. Nevertheless, the oscillatory nature of (the sign of) the
correlation function implies the signal is nearly orthogonal to currently
available observational templates, strongly reducing the sensitivity to the
enhancement. Constraints on departures from the standard Bunch-Davies vacuum
state can be derived, but also depend on the next-to-leading terms. We
emphasize that the construction and application of especially adapted templates
could lead to CMB bispectrum constraints on modified initial states already
competing with those derived from the power spectrum.

Assuming a standard disk plus bulge and logarithmic halo potential for the

this stream alone, we are unable to determine if the dark matter halo is oblate

typical of quantum gravity that may be ~ 10^18 GeV: see Phys. Lett. B 665, 412
(2008) and references therein. The MAGIC, HESS and Fermi gamma-ray telescopes
have recently probed the possible existence of such an energy-dependent vacuum
refractive index. All find indications of time-lags for higher-energy photons,
but cannot exclude the possibility that they are due to intrinsic delays at the
sources. However, the MAGIC and HESS observations of time-lags in emissions
from AGNs Mkn 501 and PKS 2155-304 are compatible with each other and a
refractive index depending linearly on the gamma-ray energy, with M_QG1 ~ 10^18
GeV. We combine their results to estimate the time-lag Delta t to be expected
for the highest-energy photon from GRB 080916c measured by the Fermi telescope,
which has an energy ~ 13.2 GeV, assuming the redshift z = 4.2 \pm 0.3 measured
by GROND. In the case of a refractive index depending linearly on the gamma-ray
energy we predict Delta t = 25 \pm 11 s. This is compatible with the time-lag
Delta t <= 16.5 s reported by the Fermi Collaboration, whereas the time-lag
would be negligible in the case of a refractive index depending quadratically
on the gamma-ray energy. We suggest a strategy for future observations that
could distinguish between a quantum-gravitational effect and other
interpretations of the time-lags observed by the MAGIC, HESS and Fermi

Schwarzschild black hole and the so-called standing accretion shock instability
(SASI), in this paper we investigate non-axisymmetric perturbations for a Kerr
black hole. The linear and non-linear phases for the shock evolution are
analyzed in detail by both 2D general relativistic hydrodynamical simulations
and linear analysis. Since the structure of steady axisymmetric accretion flows
with a standing shock wave is very sensitive to the inner transonic flow, their
properties such as Mach numbers, which are important for the stability, depend
on the Kerr parameter very much. Although the essential features of the
instability do not differ from the previous results for the Schwarzschild black
hole, the frame dragging effects specific to the Kerr black hole is also
evident. Interestingly, the oscillation periods of the fundamental unstable
modes are dependent only on the shock radius irrespective of the injection
parameters.

independently and uniformly in $n$ bins, typically the number of bins with at
least two balls in them is $\Theta(n)$ and the maximum number of balls in a bin
is $\Theta(\frac{\log n}{\log \log n})$. It is well known that when each round
offers $k$ independent uniform options for bins, it is possible to typically
achieve a constant maximal load if and only if $k=\Omega(\log n)$. Moreover, it
is possible w.h.p. to avoid any collisions between $n/2$ balls if $k>\log_2n$.
In this work, we extend this into the setting where only $m$ bits of memory are

$km\gg n$ one can achieve a constant maximal load, while for $km\ll n$ no
substantial improvement can be gained over the case $k=1$ (i.e., a random
allocation). For any $k=\Omega(\log n)$ and $m=\Omega(\log^2n)$, one can
achieve a constant load w.h.p. if $km=\Omega(n)$, yet the load is unbounded if
$km=o(n)$. Similarly, if $km>Cn$ then $n/2$ balls can be allocated without any
collisions w.h.p., whereas for $km<\epsilon n$ there are typically $\Omega(n)$
collisions. Furthermore, we show that the load is w.h.p. at least
$\frac{\log(n/m)}{\log k+\log\log(n/m)}$. In particular, for
$k\leq\operatorname {polylog}(n)$, if $m=n^{1-\delta}$ the optimal maximal load
is $\Theta(\frac{\log n}{\log\log n})$ (the same as in the case $k=1$), while
$m=2n$ suffices to ensure a constant load. Finally, we analyze nonadaptive
allocation algorithms and give tight upper and lower bounds for their

which is formed by conformally-symplectic mapping. The key assumption is that
the concept of energy in microcosm makes sense only for the steady motions

exponential phase volume contraction, is supposed to be a new universal
constant, in addition to the speed of light and Planck constant. It is shown
that statistical treatment of quantum objects as the ensembles concentrated on

behaviour of these objects as well as leads to a natural interpretation of the
wave function, stationary Schrodinger equation, and scattering matrix. To
validate the general hypotheses stated in the work, some physical models are
presented. In particular, the models support the view that the inertial motion
and quantum properties are basically determined by the vacuum as a dynamic
subsystem. The matter-vacuum interaction is described formally by means of
multivalued Hamilton function. A drawback of all these models is the
non-locality of equations of motion stemming from the non-locality of variation
of multivalued Hamilton function. This drawback can be overcome in the field
theory using multivalued functionals with a local first variation opened by S.
P. Novikov. Hence, a prospect of construction of the unified field theory in

existence of this phase transition is expected from the gauge/gravity duality,
and the pattern of the topology change is strikingly similar to the counterpart
in the gravity side, the black hole/black string transition. We also propose a
criterion, based on the behavior of the off-diagonal components, which
determines when our prescription gives a sensible definition of D-brane
positions. We provide numerical evidence that our criterion is satisfied for
the typical distance between D-branes. For a supersymmetric model, positions of
D-branes can be defined even at a shorter distance scale. The behavior of
off-diagonal elements found in this analysis gives some support for previous
studies of D-brane bound states.

Goodman's paradox the Bayesian inference is susceptible to some epistemic
limitations in the logic of induction. However Goodman's paradox applied to
cosmological hypotheses seems to be resolved due to the evolutionary character
of cosmology and accumulation new empirical evidences. We argue that the

mid-infrared energy distributions of these dwarfs and that of the T8 dwarf
2MASS J09393548-2448279. We also analyse near-infrared data for another T9,
CFBD J005910.82-011401.3. We find that the ratio of the mid- to near-infrared
fluxes is very sensitive to effective temperature at these low temperatures,
and that the 2.2 and 4.5um fluxes are sensitive to metallicity and gravity;
there is a degeneracy between these parameters. The 4.5 and 10um fluxes are
also sensitive to vertical transport of gas through the atmosphere, which we
find to be significant for these dwarfs. The full near- through mid-infrared
spectral energy distribution allows us to constrain the effective temperature

identical pair of 600K, 30 M(Jup), dwarfs. As no mid-infrared data are

nevertheless it appears to be a 550-600K dwarf with g= 300-2000 m/s2 and [m/H]=

number of structures stabilized by the transient formation of base pairs that
may induce complex folding pathways and the formation of misfolded structures.
Despite of its importance in modern biophysics, the current understanding of
RNA folding kinetics is limited by the complex interplay between the weak
base-pair interactions that stabilize the native structure and the disordering
effect of thermal forces. The possibility of mechanically pulling individual
molecules offers a new perspective to understand the folding of nucleic acids.
Here we investigate the folding and misfolding mechanism in RNA secondary
structures pulled by mechanical forces. We introduce a model based on the
identification of the minimal set of structures that reproduce the patterns of
force-extension curves obtained in single molecule experiments. The model
requires only two fitting parameters: the attempt frequency at the level of
individual base pairs and a parameter associated to a free energy correction
that accounts for the configurational entropy of an exponentially large number
of neglected secondary structures. We apply the model to interpret results
recently obtained in pulling experiments in the three-helix junction S15 RNA
molecule (RNAS15). We show that RNAS15 undergoes force-induced misfolding where
force favors the formation of a stable non-native hairpin. The model reproduces
the pattern of unfolding and refolding force-extension curves, the distribution
of breakage forces and the misfolding probability obtained in the experiments.

the small number of total counts (~170) and significant off-axis angle of the

accepted as true and legitimate in the financial world. Madoff's Ponzi scheme,
where old investors were being paid off by funds contributed by new investors,
was fundamentally flawed, yet was able to thrive for decades because of many
vested interests. `Red flags' suggesting its illegitimacy were ignored. Here I
suggest that the same is true of BCS theory. There are an increasing number of
`red flags' that strongly suggest the possibility that BCS theory may be
fundamentally flawed. For example, an ever-growing number of superconductors
are being classified as `unconventional', not described by the conventional BCS
theory and each requiring a different physical mechanism. In addition, I argue
that BCS theory is unable to explain the Meissner effect, $the$ most
fundamental property of superconductors. There are several other phenomena in
superconductors for which BCS theory provides no explanation, and BCS theory
has proven unable to predict any new superconducting compounds. From one day to
the next, Madoff's edifice came crashing down and a staggering 50 billion
dollars evaporated, and I suggest that this may also be the fate of BCS theory.
I outline an alternative theory to conventional BCS theory proposed to apply to
all superconductors, `conventional' as well as `unconventional', that offers an
explanation for the Meissner effect as well as for other puzzles and provides

although the X-ray counterpart experimented a significant decay during our

simple and sidesteps any need to explicitly describe the physics. In spite of
its simplicity, the model reproduces many key observations and has predictive
power: 1) model quasars have the correct luminosity function (by construction)
and spatial clustering (by consequence); 2) we predict high redshift quasars of
a given luminosity live in less massive dark matter halos than the same
luminosity quasars at low redshifts; 3) we predict a factor of ~5 more

between tQ~10^(7-8)yr, but which may become as short as 10^(5-6)yr for quasars
brighter than L*; 6) while little luminosity dependent clustering evolution is
expected at z<1, increasingly strong evolution is predicted for L>L* quasars at
higher redshifts. These last two results arise from the narrowing distribution
of halo masses that quasars occupy as the Universe ages. We also deconstruct
both ""downsizing"" and ""upsizing"" trends predicted by the model at different
redshifts and space densities. Importantly, this work illustrates how current

signal of single top production at the LHC. We study this signal in the context
of R-symmetric supersymmetry, which allows for large flavor violation in the
squark sector, however the results can also be generalized to the MSSM. The
single top signal arises from squark pair production in which one squark decays
to a top and gaugino, whereas the other squark decays to a non-top quark and
gaugino. We study three decay patterns: (I) squark decay into a quark and
neutralino LSP; (II) squark decay into a quark and neutralino NLSP, with
subsequent decay of the NLSP to a photon and gravitino; (III) squark decay into
a quark and chargino NLSP, with subsequent decay of the NLSP to a H^\pm/W^\pm
and gravitino. Case II is the most promising, when the NLSP decay is prompt,
since every event contains two hard photons that can be used to tag the events,
reducing the background to a negligible level. Case I is promising if the
neutralino LSP is bino-like. We carefully consider large SM backgrounds and
identify a series of cuts to isolate the signal. Case III can occur in the
MRSSM with Higgsino-like lightest gauginos. Due to the large Higgs coupling,
squarks preferentially decay to top quarks, substantially reducing the
potential flavor violating signal. Nevertheless, the flavor violating signal
might still be identifiable if the chargino NLSP is long-lived.

space domain. In particular, we consider the transition of a sine-Gordon
potential into a \Phi^4 potential. The breather field configuration is assumed
to initially evolve in a sine-Gordon potential with velocity $v$ and
oscillation frequency $\omega$. We then consider two types of numerical
experiments: a. An abrupt transition of the potential to a $\Phi^4$ form at
t_0=0 over the whole 1-dimensional lattice and b. The impact of the breather on
a region x>x_0=0 where the potential has the \Phi^4 form which is different
from the sine-Gordon form valid at x<x_0=0. We find that in both cases there is
a region of parameters (v,\omega) such that the breather decays to a
kink-antikink pair. This region of parameters for kink-antikink formation is
qualitatively similar with the parameter region where the energy of the
breather exceeds the energy of the kink-antikink pair in the \Phi^4 potential.
We demonstrate that the same mechanism for soliton formation is realized when
using a gaussian oscillator (oscillon) instead of a breather. We briefly
discuss the implications of our results for realistic experiments as well as
their extension to soliton formation in two and three space dimensions.

formation is suppressed in increasingly gas-rich mergers. We investigate the
global implications of these results in a cosmological framework, using
independent approaches: empirical halo-occupation models (where galaxies are
populated in halos according to observations) and semi-analytic models. In
both, ignoring the effects of gas in mergers leads to the over-production of
spheroids: low and intermediate-mass galaxies are predicted to be
bulge-dominated (B/T~0.5 at <10^10 M_sun), with almost no bulgeless systems),
even if they have avoided major mergers. Including the different physical
behavior of gas in mergers immediately leads to a dramatic change: bulge
formation is suppressed in low-mass galaxies, observed to be gas-rich (giving
B/T~0.1 at <10^10 M_sun, with a number of bulgeless galaxies in good agreement
with observations). Simulations and analytic models which neglect the
similarity-breaking behavior of gas have difficulty reproducing the strong
observed morphology-mass relation. However, the observed dependence of gas
fractions on mass, combined with suppression of bulge formation in gas-rich
mergers, naturally leads to the observed trends. Discrepancies between
observations and models that ignore the role of gas increase with redshift; in
models that treat gas properly, galaxies are predicted to be less
bulge-dominated at high redshifts, in agreement with the observations. We
discuss implications for the global bulge mass density and future observational

an islet consisting of two-state alpha-, beta-, and delta-cells, and analyze
effects of known chemical interactions between them with emphasis on the
combined effects of those interactions. In particular, such features as
paracrine signals of neighboring cells and cell-to-cell variations in response
to external glucose concentrations as well as glucose dynamics, depending on
insulin and glucagon hormone, are considered explicitly. Our model predicts
three possible benefits of the cell-to-cell interactions: First, the asymmetric
interaction between alpha- and beta-cells contributes to the dynamic stability
while the perturbed glucose level recovers to the normal level. Second, the
inhibitory interactions of delta-cells for glucagon and insulin secretion
prevent the wasteful co-secretion of them at the normal glucose level. Finally,
the glucose dose-responses of insulin secretion is modified to become more
pronounced at high glucose levels due to the inhibition by delta-cells. It is
thus concluded that the intercellular communications in islets of Langerhans
should contribute to the effective control of glucose homeostasis.

mergers dominate the H-alpha luminosity function above L*, while disks are
dominant at fainter luminosities. These results demonstrate that it is the

multi-level trigger systems which perform an online selection of potentially

further loss of statistics occurs when the rate of accepted events is
artificially scaled down in order to meet bandwidth constraints. An offline

determine the original statistics of the analysed data sample. This is
particularly challenging when data samples recorded by several triggers are

early-type members exhibit featureless continuum excesses that become apparent
redward of ~8 microns. In contrast, 10 and 20 micron silicate features are
present in all but one of the late-type excess members of Upper Scorpius. The
strength of silicate emission among late-type Upper Scorpius members is
spectral type dependent, with the most prominent features being associated with
K5-M2 type stars. By fitting the spectral energy distributions (SED) of a
sample of low-mass stars with accretion disk models, we find that the SEDs are
consistent with models having inner disk radii ranging from ~0.2 to 1.2 AU.
Complementary high resolution optical spectra for the Upper Scorpius excess
stars were examined for signatures of gaseous accretion. Of the 35 infrared
excess stars identified in Upper Scorpius, only 7 (all late-type) exhibit
signatures of accretion. Mass accretion rates for these stars range from ~1e-11
to 1e-9 solar masses/yr. Compared to Class II sources in Taurus-Auriga, the
disk population in Upper Scorpius exhibits reduced levels of near and
mid-infrared excess emission and an order of magnitude lower mass accretion
rates. These results suggest that the disk structure has changed significantly
over the 2-4 Myr in age separating these two stellar populations. The ubiquity
of depleted inner disks in the Upper Scorpius excess sample implies that such

redshifts from the AGN and Galaxy Evolution Survey (AGES) and data in the radio

radio, X-ray, and IR AGN samples show modest overlap, indicating that to the
flux limits of the survey, they represent largely distinct classes of AGNs. We
derive host galaxy colors and luminosities, as well as Eddington ratios
(lambda), for obscured or optically faint AGNs. We also measure the two-point
cross-correlation between AGNs and galaxies on scales of 0.3-10 h^-1 Mpc, and
derive typical dark matter halo masses. We find that: (1) radio AGNs are mainly
found in luminous red galaxies, are strongly clustered (with M_halo ~ 3x10^13
h^-1 M_sun), and have very low lambda <~ 10^-3; (2) X-ray-selected AGNs are
preferentially found in galaxies in the ""green valley"" of color-magnitude space
and are clustered similarly to typical AGES galaxies (M_halo ~ 10^13 h^-1

luminous galaxies than X-ray AGNs, are weakly clustered (M_halo <~ 10^12 h^-1

simple model of AGN and galaxy evolution, whereby a ""quasar"" phase and the
growth of the stellar bulge occurs when a galaxy's dark matter halo reaches a
critical mass between ~10^12 and 10^13 M_sun. Subsequently, star formation
ceases and AGN accretion shifts from radiatively efficient (optical- and IR-

observations of Mrk 421 from April 2006 to July 2006, when it reached its
largest X-ray flux recorded until 2006. The peak flux was about 85 milli-Crab
in the 2.0-10.0 keV band, with the peak energy (Ep) of the spectral energy
distribution (SED) laying often at energies larger than 10 keV. We performed
spectral analysis of the Swift observations investigating the trends of the
spectral parameters in terms of acceleration and energetic features
phenomenologically linked to the SSC model parameters, predicting their effects
in the gamma-ray band, in particular the spectral shape expected in the Fermi
Gamma-ray Space Telescope-LAT band. We confirm that the X-ray spectrum is well
described by a log-parabolic distribution close to Ep, with the peak flux of
the SED (Sp) being correlated with Ep, and Ep anti-correlated with the
curvature parameter (b). During the most energetic flares the UV-to-soft-X-ray
spectral shape requires an electron distribution spectral index s about 2.3.
Present analysis shows that the UV-to-X-ray emission from Mrk 421 is likely to
be originated by a population of electrons that is actually curved, with a low
energy power-law tail. The observed spectral curvature is consistent both with
stochastic acceleration or energy dependent acceleration probability
mechanisms, whereas the power-law slope form XRT-UVOT data is very close to
that inferred from the GRBs X-ray afterglow and in agreement with the universal
first-order relativistic shock acceleration models. This scenario hints that
the magnetic turbulence may play a twofold role: spatial diffusion relevant to
the first order process and momentum diffusion relevant to the second order
process.

Our approach has been to investigate the issue with an action with known
lattice artifacts, i.e., the standard Wilson quark and gauge action with
beta=5.6 and 2 degenerate flavors of sea quarks on 16^3 times 32 lattices. In
order to study in detail the sea quark mass dependence, measurements are
carried out at eight values of the PCAC quark mass values am_q from about 0.07

large am_q, a consistent scenario at sufficiently small am_q seems to emerge in
the mass-independent scheme where for a fixed beta, 1/r_0 and sqrt{sigma} have
linear dependence on m_q as physical effects similar to the quark mass
dependence of the rho mass. We present evidence for this scenario and
accordingly extract the lattice scale (a = 0.0805(7) fm, a^{-1} = 2.45(2) GeV)

access the accuracy in the Star Formation History (SFH) that can be expected

images containing not only the LMC stellar populations but also the foreground
MW stars and background galaxies. We perform aperture photometry over these
simulated images, access the expected levels of photometric errors and
incompleteness, and apply the classical technique of SFH-recovery based on the
reconstruction of colour-magnitude diagrams (CMD) via the minimization of a
chi-squared-like statistics. We then evaluate the expected errors in the
recovered star formation rate as a function of stellar age, SFR(t), starting
from models with a known Age--Metallicity Relation (AMR). It turns out that,
for a given sky area, the random errors for ages older than ~0.4 Gyr seem to be
independent of the crowding. For a spatial resolution of ~0.1 sqdeg, the random
errors in SFR(t) will be below 20% for this wide range of ages. On the other
hand, due to the smaller stellar statistics for stars younger than ~0.4 Gyr,
the outer LMC regions will require larger areas to achieve the same level of
accuracy in the SFR(t). If we consider the AMR as unknown, the SFH-recovery
algorithm is able to accurately recover the input AMR, at the price of an
increase of random errors in the SFR(t) by a factor of about 2.5. Experiments
of SFH-recovery performed for varying distance modulus and reddening indicate
that the propagation of the errors in these parameters in the SFR(t) implies
systematic errors below 30%.

lengths with S/N/Ang>=50. Several different model fitting techniques involving
absorption-line indices and full spectrum fitting are explored and found to
weigh age, metallicity, and abundance ratios differently. The SPs of spiral
galaxies are not well matched by single episodes of star formation;
representative SPs must involve average SP values integrated over the star
formation history (SFH) of the galaxy. Our ""full population synthesis"" method
is an optimised linear combination of model templates to the full spectrum with
masking of regions poorly represented by the models. Our spiral bulges follow
the same correlations of increasing light-weighted age and metallicity with
central velocity dispersion as those of elliptical galaxies and early-type
bulges found in other studies, but when SFHs more complex and realistic than a
single burst are invoked, the trend with age is shallower and the scatter much
reduced. In a mass-weighted context, all bulges are predominantly composed of
old and metal-rich SPs. Bulge formation appears to dominated by early processes
that are common to all spheroids, whether they currently reside in disks or
not. While monolithic collapse cannot be ruled out in some cases, merging must
be invoked to explain the SP gradients in most bulges. Further bulge growth via
secular processes or ""rejuvenated"" star formation generally contributes
minimally to the stellar mass budget. (Abridged)

based on the special case of planetary motion in the solar system. Not
surprisingly when extended to galactic rotations and cosmology Newtonian
dynamics is found to be wanting, and the fix-up involves introducing dark
matter and dark energy, as shown herein. However a different theory of gravity
leads to a different account of galactic rotations and cosmology, and does not
require dark matter nor dark energy to fit the supernova data. It is shown that
fitting the LambdaCDM model to this new model, and so independently of the
actual supernova data, requires the LambdaCDM model parameters to be those
given above. Hence we conclude that dark energy and dark matter are no more
than mathematical artifacts to fix-up limitations of Newtonian gravity. Various

physicists believe that the spectral gap of the continuous-time chain exhibits
the following behavior. For some critical inverse-temperature $\beta_c$, the
inverse-gap is bounded for $\beta < \beta_c$, polynomial in the surface area
for $\beta = \beta_c$ and exponential in it for $\beta > \beta_c$. This has
been proved for $\Z^2$ except at criticality. So far, the only underlying
geometry where the critical behavior has been confirmed is the complete graph.
Recently, the dynamics for the Ising model on a regular tree, also known as the
Bethe lattice, has been intensively studied. The facts that the inverse-gap is
bounded for $\beta < \beta_c$ and exponential for $\beta > \beta_c$ were
established, where $\beta_c$ is the critical spin-glass parameter, and the
tree-height $h$ plays the role of the surface area.

on the $b$-ary tree, by showing that it is indeed polynomial in $h$ at
criticality. The degree of our polynomial bound does not depend on $b$, and
furthermore, this result holds under any boundary condition. We also obtain
analogous bounds for the mixing-time of the chain. In addition, we study the

time measures that are directly related to intrinsic time scales of the burst.
Einstein's theory of relativity is quite definite that if the universe is
expanding then the observed duration of these measures will increase with
redshift. Thus gamma-ray burst measures should show a time dilation
proportional to redshift. An analysis of gamma-ray burst data shows that the
hypothesis of time dilation is rejected with a probability of
4.4$\times10^{-6}$ for redshifts out to z=6.6. Traditionally the lack of an
apparent time dilation has been explained by an inverse correlation between
luminosity and time measures together with strong luminosity selection as a
function of redshift. It is shown that the inverse correlation between
luminosity and some time measures is confirmed, but using concordance cosmology
strong luminosity selection cannot be achieved. It may be possible to explain
the apparent lack of time dilation with a combination of gamma-ray burst
selection, some luminosity evolution and some time measure evolution. But this
requires a remarkable coincidence in order to produce the apparent lack of time
dilation. However the data are consistent with a static cosmology in a
non-expanding universe.

shows that there is good agreement between the light-curve widths and $(1+z)$
which is usually interpreted as a strong support for time dilation due to an
expanding universe. This paper argues that a strong case can be made for a
static universe where the supernovae light-curve-width dependence on redshift
is due to selection effects. The analysis is based on the principle that it is
the total energy (the fluence) and not the peak magnitude that is the best
`standard candle' for type 1a supernovae. A simple model using a static
cosmology provides an excellent prediction for the dependence of light curve
width on redshift and the luminosity-width relationship for nearby supernovae.
The width dependence arises from the assumption of constant absolute magnitude
resulting in strong selection of lower luminosity supernovae at higher
redshifts due to the use of an incorrect distance modulus. Using a static
cosmology, curvature-cosmology, and without fitting any parameters the analysis
shows that the total energy is independent of redshift and provides a Hubble
constant of $63.1\pm2.5$ kms$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. There is no indication of any
deviation at large redshifts that has been ascribed to the occurrence of dark
energy.

order to determine the detailed composition of the envelope and atmosphere as

composition of the neutron-star envelope determines the total photon flux from

spectrum. Our calculations using each of the three cooling models indicate that
without accretion of fallback the neutron star atmospheres are dependent on the

quasi-parabolic molecular outflow, roughly coincident with an IR nebula
revealed by the Spitzer 3.6 and 4.5 micron emission. The outflow has ~98 Msun
molecular gas, making it one of the most massive molecular outflows known, and
resulting in a very high mass-loss rate of 4.1 by 10^{-3} Msun yr^{-1} over a
dynamical timescale of 2.4 by 10^4 yr. The 1.3 mm continuum observations with a
4"" by 3"" beam reveal a flattened dusty envelope of ~150 Msun, which is further
resolved with a 1.2"" by 1"" beam into three dense cores with a total mass of ~40

approximately coincides with the geometric center of the bipolar outflow thus
most likely harbors the powering source of the outflow. Overall our
observations provide the best case to date of a well-defined wide-angle
molecular outflow in a >10^4 Lsun star-forming region. The outflow is
morphologically and kinematically similar to low-mass protostellar outflows but
has two to three orders of magnitude greater mass, momentum, and energy, and is
apparently driven by an underlying wide-angle wind, hence further supports that

four-terminal SO-coupled nanostructures, injection of unpolarized charge
current through the longitudinal leads is responsible not only for the pure
spin Hall current in the transverse leads, but also for nonequilibrium random
time-dependent current fluctuations. The analysis of the shot noise of
transverse pure spin Hall current and zero charge current, or transverse spin
current and non-zero charge Hall current, driven by unpolarized or

unique experimental tool to differentiate between the intrinsic Rashba and

in the limiting deterministic system in dependence of the strength and phase of

net motion averages to zero. Strikingly, with the application of an additional
time-delayed feedback term directed particle motion can be accomplished
persisting up to fairly high levels of the thermal noise. In detail, there
exist values of the feedback strength and delay time for which the feedback
term performs oscillations that are phase locked to the time-periodic external

forward and backward motion of distinct duration, and thus directed motion. In
terms of phase space dynamics we demonstrate that with applied feedback

mass functions (CMFs) derived for a molecular cloud using extinction data and a
core identification scheme based on two-dimensional thresholding.
  Methods: We performed simulations where a population of artificial cores was
embedded into the variable background extinction field of the Pipe nebula. We
extracted the cores from the simulated extinction maps, constructed the CMFs,
and compared them to the input CMFs. The simulations were repeated using a
variety of extraction parameters and several core populations with differing
input mass functions and differing degrees of crowding.
  Results: The fidelity of the observed CMF depends on the parameters selected
for the core extraction algorithm for our background. More importantly, it
depends on how crowded the core population is. We find that the observed CMF
recovers the true CMF reliably when the mean separation of cores is larger than
their mean diameter (f>1). If this condition holds, the derived CMF is accurate
and complete above M > 0.8-1.5 Msun, depending on the parameters used for the
core extraction. In the simulations, the best fidelity was achieved with the
detection threshold of 1 or 2 times the rms-noise of the extinction data, and
with the contour level spacings of 3 times the rms-noise. Choosing larger
threshold and wider level spacings increases the limiting mass. The simulations
show that when f>1.5, the masses of individual cores are recovered with a
typical uncertainty of 25-30 %. When f=1 the uncertainty is ~60 %. In very
crowded cases where f<1 the core identification algorithm is unable to recover
the masses of the cores adequately. For the cores of the Pipe nebula f~2.0 and
therefore the use of the method in that region is justified.

developed here to explore the potential existence of such macroscopic
behaviors. By imposing an unobserved internal state-space variable into the
system, each individual's event-history is made into a composition of a common
state duration and an individual specific time to action. With the common state
modeling of the macroscopic behavior, parametric statistical inferences are
derived under the current-status data structure and conditional independence
assumptions. Identifiability and computation related problems are also
addressed. From the dynamic perspectives of system-wise heterogeneity, this SSB
mass event-history model is shown to be very distinct from a random effect
model via the Principle Component Analysis (PCA) in a numerical experiment.
Real data showing the mass invasion by two species of parasitic nematode into
two species of host larvae are also analyzed. The analysis results not only are

galaxies that have been observed as part of the Westerbork HI Survey of Spiral
and Irregular Galaxies (WHISP) project. The rotation curves were derived by
interactively fitting model data cubes to the observed cubes, taking rotation
curve shape, HI distribution, inclination, and the size of the beam into
account. This makes it possible to correct for the effects of beam smearing.
The dwarf galaxies in our sample have rotation-curve shapes that are similar to
those of late-type spiral galaxies, in the sense that their rotation curves,
when expressed in units of disk scale lengths, rise as steeply in the inner
parts and start to flatten at two disk scale lengths. None of the galaxies in
our sample have solid-body rotation curves that extend beyond three scale
lengths. The logarithmic outer rotation curve slopes are similar between
late-type dwarf and spiral galaxies. Thus, whether the flat part of the
rotation curve is reached seems to depend more on the extent of the rotation
curve than on its amplitude. We also find that the outer rotation curve shape
does not strongly depend on luminosity, at least for galaxies fainter than
M_R~-19. We find that in spiral galaxies and in the central regions of
late-type dwarf galaxies, the shape of the central distribution of light and
the inner rise of the rotation curve are related. This implies that galaxies
with stronger central concentrations of light also have higher central mass
densities, and it suggests that the luminous mass dominates the gravitational
potential in the central regions, even in low surface brightness dwarf
galaxies.

to semantics, where meaning is considered to be an emergent feature arising
context-dependently in action. Since representational theories are unable to
deal with context, a new formalism is required toward a contextual theory of
concepts. SCOP is considered a promising formalism in this sense and is briefly
described.

our knowledge about hard X-ray loop-top sources. Recently, the survey of
partially occulted flares observed by the RHESSI has been published (Krucker &
Lin 2008). The extensive YOHKOH database still awaits such activities. This
work is an attempt to fill this gap. Among from 1286 flares in the YOHKOH Hard
X-ray Telescope Flare Catalogue, for which the hard X-ray images had been
enclosed, we identified 98 events that occurred behind the solar limb. We
investigated their hard X-ray spectra and spatial structure. We found that in
most cases the hard X-ray spectrum of partially occulted flares consists of two
components, non-thermal and thermal, which are co-spatial. The photon energy
spectra of the partially occulted flares are systematically steeper than
spectra of the non-occulted flares. Such a difference we explain as a
consequence of intrinsically dissimilar conditions ruling in coronal parts of
flares, in comparison with the footpoints which usually dominate the hard X-ray
emission of disk flares. At least two reasons of the difference should be taken
into consideration: (1) stronger contamination of hard X-rays with emission of
thermal plasma, (2) different mechanism in which non-thermal electrons radiate
their energy. A schematic picture, in which thin-target mechanism is
responsible for hard X-ray emission of loop-top sources and thick-target
mechanism -- for emission of footpoint sources, can be modified by the presence
of some coronal thick-target sources. At least a part of them suggests a
magnetic trapping. Investigated flares do not respond the global magnetic
configuration of the solar corona. For their characteristics conclusive is
rather the local magnetic configuration in which they were developed.

in a six dimensional spacetime with 3 timelike and 3 spacelike coordinates. The
spacetime interval $ds^2=dx_\mu dx^\mu$ is left invariant under the symmetry
group SO(3,3). We obtain the six-dimensional version of the Dirac gamma
matrices, $\Gamma_\mu$, and write down a Dirac-like lagrangian density, ${\cal
L}=i \bar{\psi} \Gamma ^\mu \nabla_\mu \psi$. The spinor $\psi$ is decomposed
into two Dirac spinors, $\psi_1$ and $\psi_2$, which we interpret as the
electron and neutrino fields, respectively. In six-dimensional spacetime the
electron and neutrino fields are then merged in a natural manner. The SO(3,3)
Lorentz symmetry group must be locally broken to the observable SO(1,3) Lorentz
group, with only one observable time component, $t_z$. The $t_z$-axis may not
be the same at all points of the spacetime and the effect of breaking the
SO(3,3) spacetime symmetry group locally to an SO(1,3) Lorentz group is
perceived by the observers as the existence of the gauge fields. The origin of
mass may be attributed to the remaining two hidden timelike dimensions. We
interpret the origin of mass and gauge interactions as a consequence of extra
time dimensions, without the need of the so-called Higgs mechanism for the
generation of mass. Further, we are able to give a geometric meaning to the
electromagnetic and non-abelian gauge symmetries.

known. The actual form of the so--called radius--to--frequency mapping should
be reflected in the aberration--retardation (A/R) effects that shift and/or
delay the photons depending on the emission height in the magnetosphere. Recent
studies suggest that in a handful of pulsars the A/R effect can be discerned
w.r.t the peak of the central core emission region. To verify these effects in
an ensemble of pulsars we launched a project analysing multi--frequency total
intensity pulsar profiles obtained from the new observations from the Giant
Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT), Arecibo Observatory (AO) and archival
European Pulsar Network (EPN) data. For all these profiles we measure the shift
of the outer cone components with respect to the core component which is
necessary for establishing the A/R effect. Within our sample of 23 pulsars 7
show the A/R effects, 12 of them (doubtful cases) show a tendency towards this
effect, while the remaining 4 are obvious counter examples. The
counter--examples and doubtful cases may arise from uncertainties in
determination of the location of the meridional plane and/or the core emission
component. It hence appears that the A/R effects are likely to operate in most
pulsars from our sample. We conclude that in cases where those effects are
present the core emission has to originate below the conal emission region.

numerical model, which simulates the emission of a rotating disk with the
expected general properties of such objects; a very satisfactory fitting of our
maps is obtained. The meaning and reliability of our results are thoroughly
discussed. Our observations allow measurement of the main properties of GoHam
at scales between ~ 1"" (~ 5 10^15 cm, for the assumed distance, 300 pc) and the
total extent of the nebula, 14"". We are able to measure the global structure of
the gas-rich disk, which is found to be flaring, and its dynamics, which is
clearly dominated by keplerian rotation, with a very small degree of
turbulence. The combination of different lines, particularly showing different
opacities, allows us to reasonably estimate the distributions of the gas
temperature and density. We clearly find a significant and sharp increase in
temperature at large distances from the equator, accompanied by a decrease in
density of the same order. Finally, we identify and study a condensation in the
southern part of the disk that has no counterparts in the rest of the nebula.
This condensation is quite extended (about 5 10^15 cm), contains a significant
amount of mass (roughly, ~ 6 10^-3 Mo), and seems to be associated with a
detectable distortion of the global rotation kinematics.

obliquity. The very-high energy gamma-ray maps due to inverse Compton process
are also synthesized. The properties of images in these different wavelength
bands are compared, with particular emphasis on the location of the bright
limbs in bilateral SNRs. Recent H.E.S.S. observations of SN 1006 show that the

injection is isotropic but the variation of the maximum energy of electrons is
rather quick to compensate for differences in magnetic field; ii) obliquity
dependence of injection (either quasi-parallel or quasi-perpendicular) and the
electron maximum energy is strong enough to dominate magnetic field variation.
In the latter case, the obliquity dependence of the injection and the maximum
energy should not be opposite. We argue that the position of the limbs alone
and even their coincidence in radio, X-rays and gamma-rays, as it is discovered
by H.E.S.S. in SN 1006, cannot be conclusive about the dependence of the
electron injection efficiency, the compression/amplification of ISMF and the

late-type spiral galaxies based on XMM-Newton observations. Since our primary
focus is on the linkage between X-ray emission and star formation in extended,
extranuclear galactic disks, we have selected galaxies with near face-on aspect
and sufficient angular extent so as to be readily amenable to investigation
with the moderate spatial resolution afforded by XMM-Newton. After excluding
regions in each galaxy dominated by bright point sources, we study both the
morphology and spectral properties of the residual X-ray emission, comprised of
both diffuse emission and the integrated signal of the fainter discrete source
populations. The soft X-ray morphology generally traces the inner spiral arms
and shows a strong correlation with the distribution of UV light, indicative of
a close connection between the X-ray emission and recent star formation. The
soft (0.3-2 keV) X-ray luminosity to star formation rate (SFR) ratio varies
from 1-5 x 10^39 erg/s(/Msun/yr), with an indication that the lower range of
this ratio relates to regions of lower SFR density. The X-ray spectra are well
matched by a two-temperature thermal model with derived temperatures of
typically ~0.2 keV and ~0.65 keV, in line with published results for other
normal and star-forming galaxies. The hot component contributes a higher
fraction of the soft luminosity in the galaxies with highest X-ray/SFR ratio,
suggesting a link between plasma temperature and X-ray production efficiency.
The physical properties of the gas present in the galactic disks are consistent
with a clumpy thin-disk distribution, presumably composed of diffuse structures
such as superbubbles together with the integrated emission of unresolved
discrete sources including young supernova remnants.

magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the disk-magnetosphere interaction in cases
where the magnetic field of the star is bunched into an X-type configuration.
Such a configuration arises if the effective viscosity of the disk is larger
than the effective diffusivity, or if the accretion rate in the disk is
enhanced. Conical outflows flow from the inner edge of the disk into a narrow
shell with half-opening angle of 30-45 degrees. The outflow carries about
0.1-0.3 of the disk mass accretion rate and part of the disk's angular
momentum. The conical winds are driven by the gradient of the magnetic pressure
which exists above the disk due to the winding of the stellar magnetic field.
Exploratory 3D simulations show that conical winds are symmetric about rotation
axis of the disk even if the magnetic dipole is significantly misaligned with
the disk's rotation axis. Conical winds appear around stars of different
periods. However, in the case of a star in the ""propeller"" regime, an
additional - much faster component appears: an axial jet, where matter is
accelerated up to very high velocities at small distances from the star by
magnetic pressure force above the surface of the star. The simulations are done
in dimensionless units and are applicable to a variety of the disk-accreting
magnetized stars: young stars, white dwarfs, neutron stars, and possibly black
holes. For the case of young stars, conical winds and axial jets may appear in
different cases, including Class I young stars, classical T Tauri stars, and
EXors. In EXors periods of enhanced accretion may lead to the formation of
conical winds which correspond to the outflows observed from these stars.
