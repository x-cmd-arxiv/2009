binary systems with a total mass between 2 and 35 Msun and a minimum component
mass of 1 Msun using data from the first year of the fifth science run (S5) of
the three LIGO detectors, operating at design sensitivity. Depending on mass,
we are sensitive to coalescences as far as 150 Mpc from the Earth. No
gravitational wave signals were observed above the expected background.
Assuming a compact binary objects population with a Gaussian mass distribution
representing binary neutron star systems, black hole-neutron star binary
systems, and binary black hole systems, we calculate the 90%-confidence upper
limit on the rate of coalescences to be 3.9 \times 10^{-2} yr^{-1} L_{10}^{-1},
1.1 \times 10^{-2} yr^{-1} L_{10}^{-1}, and 2.5 \times 10^{-3} yr^{-1}
L_{10}^{-1} respectively, where $L_{10}$ is $10^{10}$ times the blue solar
luminosity. We also set improved upper limits on the rate of compact binary
coalescences per unit blue-light luminosity, as a function of mass.

solution is analytical, the general properties of the perturbative solution can

coupled to homogeneous electromagnetic backgrounds, both at zero and at finite
temperature and density. In the case of a purely magnetic field, we analyze the
relationship between the invariance of the theory under large gauge
transformations, the appearance of Chern-Simons terms and of different Berry's
phases. In the case of a purely electric background field, we show that the
effective Lagrangian is independent of the chemical potential and of the
temperature. More interesting: we show that the minimal conductivity, as
predicted by the quantum field theory, is the right multiple of the
conductivity quantum and is, thus, consistent with the value measured for
graphene, with no extra factor of pi in the denominator.

Free Lunch"", W. Dembski claims to have established a robust decision process
that can determine when observed structures in the natural world can be
attributed to design. Dembski's decision process first asks whether a structure
as an outcome can be explained by the regularity of natural laws. If not, and
the outcome can be ""specified"", a randomness test is devised to determine
whether an observed low probability outcome indicates design. It is argued in
this paper that the Dembski test is unworkable and is better formulated in
terms of a Martin Loef universal randomness test. A universal randomness test
will show that most observed outcomes in the natural world are non random; they
are highly ordered. However this does not necessarily demonstrate design, as
the decision is not between chance and design, but between natural laws and
design. The Dembski decision template, which eliminates natural processes in
the first decision step, is flawed, forcing a design outcome when none is
warranted. Dembski also introduces a 4th law of thermodynamics, the law of
conservation of information to argue information cannot emerge from random
processes. However if a more robust measure of information based on algorithmic
entropy is used, the so called 4th law is seen to contain no more than the
second law of thermodynamics.
  In conclusion, despite the good intentions, the approach fails to offer any
new insights into the adequacy of evolutionary theory and should not be
regarded as demonstrable science.

SN 1998bw associated with Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) 980425, the following
conditions are required: Edot_iso Mdot_iso > ~ 10^{51} erg M_sun s^{-2} and

0.4M_sun) is probably produced in the shocked stellar mantle, not in the wind.
The expected natures of SNe, e.g., ejected 56Ni masses and ejecta masses, vary
depending on Edot_iso and Mdot_iso. The sequence of the SN properties from high
Edot_iso and Mdot_iso to low Edot_iso and Mdot_iso is the following: SN
1998bw-like -- intermediate case -- low mass ejecta (< ~ 1M_sun$) where 56Ni is

the inner mass distribution of massive galaxy clusters. In particular, clusters
with large Einstein radii provide a wealth of multiply imaged systems in the
cluster core allowing to determine precisely the shape of the central dark
matter profile. This paper presents a spectroscopic survey in the massive
cluster Abell 1703, displaying a large Einstein radius (28"" at z=2.8) and a
high number of strongly-lensed systems including a central ring-like
configuration. We used LRIS on Keck to target multiple images and lensed galaxy
candidates, and use the measured redshifts to constrain the mass distribution
of the cluster using a parametric model. The data enable us to measure accurate
redshifts in good agreement with their photometric redshifts, and to update the
identification of multiply imaged systems by discovering 3 new systems and a
radial counter image. We also report the discovery of a remarkably bright ~3.6
L* i-band dropout at z=5.827 in our mask which is only moderately magnified by
the cluster (~3.0+/-0.08). The improved parametric mass model, including 16
multiple systems with 10 spectroscopic redshifts, further constrains the
cluster-scale mass distribution with a generalized NFW profile of best-fit
logarithmic slope alpha=0.92+/-0.04, concentration c200=4.72+/-0.40 and scale
radius rs=476+/-45 kpc. Our strong-lensing model predicts a large scale shear
signal consistent with Subaru weak-lensing measurements out to 4 Mpc h^-1.
Together with the fact that the strong-lensing modeling requires a single dark
matter clump, this suggests that Abell 1703 is a relaxed, unimodal cluster.
This unique cluster could be probed further using deep X-ray, SZ and dynamics
analysis, for a detailed study of the physics in a relaxed cluster. (abridged)

paper we further study the structure of such a neutron-star disk based on the
two-region (i.e., inner & outer) disk scenario following our previous work, and
calculate the neutrino annihilation luminosity from the disk in various cases.
We investigate the effects of the viscosity parameter, energy parameter
(measuring the neutrino cooling efficiency of the inner disk) and outflow
strength on the structure of the entire disk as well as the effect of emission
from the neutron star surface boundary emission on the total neutrino
annihilation rate. The inner disk satisfies the entropy-conservation or the
advection-dominated self-similar structure depending on the energy parameter.
An outflow from the disk decreases the density and pressure but increases the
thickness of the disk. Moreover, compared with the black-hole disk, the
neutrino annihilation luminosity above the neutron-star disk is higher, and the
neutrino emission from the boundary layer could increase the neutrino
annihilation luminosity by about one order of magnitude higher than the disk
without boundary emission. The neutron-star disk with the advection-dominated
inner disk could produce the highest neutrino luminosity while the disk with an
outflow has the lowest. Although a heavily mass-loaded outflow from the neutron
star surface at early times of neutron star formation prevents the outflow
material from being accelerated to a high bulk Lorentz factor, an energetic
ultrarelativistic jet via neutrino annihilation can be produced above the
stellar polar region at late times if the disk accretion rate and the neutrino
emission luminosity from the surface boundary layer are sufficiently high.

properties has been started. The present paper concludes the project by turning
to classical mechanics. The quantum states that maximize entropy for given
averages and variances of coordinates and momenta are called ME packets. They
generalize the Gaussian wave packets. A non-trivial extension of the
partition-function method of probability calculus to quantum mechanics is
given. Non-commutativity of quantum variables limits its usefulness. Still, the
general form of the state operators of ME packets is obtained with its help.
The diagonal representation of the operators is found. A general way of
calculating averages that can replace the partition function method is
described. Classical mechanics is reinterpreted as a statistical theory.
Classical trajectories are replaced by classical ME packets. Quantum states
approximate classical ones if the product of the coordinate and momentum
variances is much larger than Planck constant. Thus, ME packets with large
variances follow their classical counterparts better than Gaussian wave
packets.

angle $\alpha$ at the reflection is obtained in the plane of $M$ and the
incident angle $\theta$ measured from the normal to the interface. The $\alpha$
shows rich structures around the quantum critical point M=0 and $\theta=0$,
i.e., $\alpha$ can be as large as $\sim \pi$ at an incident angle in the quatum
spin Hall case $M<0$ because the helical edge modes resonantly enhance the spin
rotation, which can be used to map the energy dispersion of the helical edge
modes. As an experimentally relevant system, we also study spin rotation effect
in quantum spin Hall/normal metal/quantum spin Hall trilayer junction.

the counterterms are evaluated at the Hubble-radius crossing time or few
e-foldings after it, the predictions of slow-roll inflation for both the scalar

the consistency condition that relates the tensor-to-scalar amplitude ratio
with spectral indices. A reexamination of the potentials $\bf{\phi^2, \phi^4}$,
shows that both are compatible with five-year WMAP data. Only when the

recovers the standard predictions. The alternative predictions presented here

gets multiplied by a nonconstant background metric; in $\phi-4$ theory the
theorem that $\int d^4 x \phi \star \phi = \int d^4 x \phi^2$ is no longer true

based on the concept of the unscented transform (Julier et al., 2000; Julier

Kalman filter (EnUKF) in this work. When the error distribution of the analysis
is symmetric (not necessarily Gaussian), it can be shown that, compared to the
ordinary EnKF, the EnUKF has more accurate estimations of the ensemble mean and
covariance of the background by examining the multidimensional Taylor series
expansion term by term. This implies that, the EnUKF may have better
performance in state estimation than the ordinary EnKF in the sense that the
deviations from the true states are smaller. For verification, some numerical
experiments are conducted on a 40-dimensional system due to Lorenz and Emanuel
(Lorenz and Emanuel, 1998). Simulation results support our argument.

its emission in the soft X-ray and radio ranges. We suggest the model of the
radio pulse formation in the Vela pulsar, develop the theory of the radio
photon reprocessing to high energies and on this basis interpret the observed
X-ray - radio connection. The processes of spontaneous and induced scattering
of radio waves off the spiraling particles and their observational consequences
are examined. The particles are assumed to acquire relativistic gyration
energies due to resonant absorption of the radio emission in the outer
magnetosphere of a pulsar. The spectral and angular distributions of the
spontaneously scattered power are analyzed and compared with the
characteristics of the particle synchrotron emission. The consequences of
intensity transfer from the radio beam to the background in the course of
induced scattering are studied as well. It is demonstrated that the induced
scattering can account for the basic features of the Vela's radio profile and
its pulse-to-pulse fluctuations. In particular, it can explain a greater role
of the leading component and its earlier arrival in stronger pulses. The
studies of the radio photon reprocessing to high energies in application to the
Vela pulsar shows that the scattered and synchrotron spectra peak at 0.8 and
0.2 keV, respectively, with the corresponding luminosities of 10^{29} erg
s^{-1} and 10^{31} erg s^{-1}. Within the framework of our model, the observed
X-ray - radio connection is explained in terms of the interplay between the
processes of induced and spontaneous scattering of the radio pulse.

the law of likelihood for composite hypotheses. The generalized law is
developed in an axiomatic fashion, illustrated with real examples, and examined
in an asymptotic analysis. Previous concerns about including composite

the formation of young brown dwarfs. To date two optical outflows have been
discovered and results presented in this paper increase this number to three.
Using spectro-astrometry the origin of the LS-RCrA 1 forbidden emission lines
in a blue-shifted outflow is confirmed. The non-detection of the red-shifted
component of the outflow in forbidden lines, along with evidence for some
separation between low and high velocity outflow components, do not support the
hypothesis that LS-RCrA 1 has an edge-on accretion disk. The key result of this
analysis is the discovery of an outflow component to the H-alpha line. The
H-alpha line profile has blue and red-shifted features in the wings which
spectro-astrometry reveals to also originate in the outflow. The discovery that
H-alpha emission in BDs can have a significant contribution from an outflow
suggests the use of H-alpha line widths as a proxy of mass accretion in BDs is
not clear-cut. This method assumes that any contribution to the H-alpha line
flux from a possible outflow is negligible. Finally the fact that the H-alpha
line traces both lobes of the outflow while only the blue-shifted lobe is seen
in forbidden emission points to the presence of a dust hole in the accretion
disk of LS-RCrA 1. This is commonly seen in CTTSs and is assumed to signal the
onset of planet formation.

two states is different for different sources, ranging from 1% to 4% of the
Eddington luminosity. Even for the same source the transition luminosity at
different outbursts is also different. The transition can occur from 0.0069 to
0.15 Eddington luminosity. To investigate the underlying physics, we study the
influence of viscosity parameter $\alpha$ on the transition luminosity on the
basis of the disk-corona model for black holes. We calculate the mass
evaporation rate for a wide range of viscosity parameter, $0.1\le \alpha\le
0.9$. By fitting the numerical results, we obtain fitting formulae for both the
transition accretion rate and the corresponding radius as a function of
$\alpha$. We find that the transition luminosity is very sensitive to the value
of $\alpha$, $L/L_{\rm Edd}\propto\alpha^{2.34}$. For $0.1\le\alpha\le 0.6$,
the transition luminosity varies by two orders of magnitude, from 0.001 to 0.2
Eddington luminosity. Comparing with observations we find that the transition
luminosity can be fitted by adjusting the value of $\alpha$, and the model
determined values of $\alpha$ are mostly in the range of observationally
inferred value. Meanwhile we investigate the truncation of the disk in the
low/hard state for some luminous sources. Our results are roughly in agreement

core is surrounded by structures with radial scales of hundreds of kilometers,
called ""spirals"" and ""jets"". Gravitational scattering by nearby moons was
suggested as a potential production mechanism; however, it remained doubtful
because a population of Prometheus-mass moons is needed and, obviously, such a
population does not exist in the F ring region. We investigate here another
mechanism: dissipative physical collisions of kilometer-size moonlets (or
clumps) with the F-ring core. We show that it is a viable and efficient
mechanism for producing spirals and jets, provided that massive moonlets are
embedded in the F-ring core and that they are impacted by loose clumps orbiting
in the F ring region, which could be consistent with recent data from ISS, VIMS
and UVIS. We show also that coefficients of restitution as low as ~0.1 are
needed to reproduce the radial extent of spirals and jets, suggesting that
collisions are very dissipative in the F ring region. In conclusion, spirals
and jets would be the direct manifestation the ongoing collisional activity of
the F ring region.

close to equilibrium. Away from equilibrium, one may describe the microscopic
time evolution by a general differentiable dynamical system, identify
nonequilibrium steady states (NESS), and study how these vary under
perturbations of the dynamics. Remarkably, it turns out that for uniformly
hyperbolic dynamical systems (those satisfying the ""chaotic hypothesis""), the
linear response away from equilibrium is very similar to the linear response
close to equilibrium: the Kramers-Kronig dispersion relations hold, and the
fluctuation-dispersion theorem survives in a modified form (which takes into
account the oscillations around the ""attractor"" corresponding to the NESS). If
the chaotic hypothesis does not hold, two new phenomena may arise. The first is
a violation of linear response in the sense that the NESS does not depend
differentiably on parameters (but this nondifferentiability may be hard to see
experimentally). The second phenomenon is a violation of the dispersion
relations: the susceptibility has singularities in the upper half complex
plane. These ""acausal"" singularities are actually due to ""energy
nonconservation"": for a small periodic perturbation of the system, the
amplitude of the linear response is arbitrarily large. This means that the NESS
of the dynamical system under study is not ""inert"" but can give energy to the
outside world. An ""active"" NESS of this sort is very different from an
equilibrium state, and it would be interesting to see what happens for active
states to the Gallavotti-Cohen fluctuation theorem.

is comparable to the spatial scale of the X-ray hot spots recently discovered

out in the region with frequent supernova explosions, such as in the Galactic

particular attention is devoted to uncertainty evaluation for scaling factors,

We argue that linear models used for calibration of scaling factors are
generally not statistically valid, in the sense that they are not able to fit
calibration data within their uncertainty limits. Uncertainty evaluation and
uncertainty propagation by statistical methods from such invalid models are
doomed to failure. To relieve this problem, a stochastic function is included
in the model to account for model inadequacy, according to the Bayesian Model
Calibration approach. In this framework, we demonstrate that standard
calibration summary statistics, as optimal scaling factor and root mean square,
can be safely used for uncertainty propagation only when large calibration sets
of precise data are used. For small datasets containing a few dozens of data, a
more accurate formula is provided which involves scaling factor calibration
uncertainty. For measurement uncertainties larger than model inadequacy, the
problem can be reduced to a weighted least squares analysis. For intermediate
cases, no analytical estimators were found, and numerical Bayesian estimation
of parameters has to be used.

interaction does not depend solely on the potential difference between probe
and sample, but instead it may depend on the bias applied to each conductor.
For instance, electrostatic force can change from repulsive to attractive for
certain ranges of applied potentials and probe-sample distances, and this fact
cannot be accounted for by approximated models. We propose a general
capacitance model, even applicable to more than two conductors, considering
values of potentials applied to each of the conductors to determine the
resulting forces and force gradients, being able to account for the above
phenomenon as well as to describe interactions at larger distances. Results

analyzed by simulating the underlying stochastic process. The fluctuations
around the thermal equilibrium in the model are treated as avalanches. We show
that the distributions for the fluctuation length differences at subsequent
time steps are in the shape of a $q$-Gaussian (the distribution which is
obtained naturally in the context of nonextensive statistical mechanics) if one
avoids the finite size effects by increasing the system size. We provide a
clear numerical evidence that the relation between the exponent $\tau$ of
avalanche size distribution obtained by maximum likelihood estimation and the
$q$ value of appropriate q-Gaussian obeys the analytical result recently
introduced by Caruso et al. [Phys. Rev. E \textbf{75}, 055101(R) (2007)]. This
rescues the q parameter to remain as a fitting parameter and allows us to
determine its value a priori from one of the well known exponents of such
dynamical systems.
