translated in a sound and complete way into modal logic S4. We have previously
outlined how normal multimodal logics, including monomodal logics K and S4, can
be embedded in simple type theory (which is also known as higher-order logic)
and we have demonstrated that the higher-order theorem prover LEO-II can
automate reasoning in and about them. In this paper we combine these results
and describe a sound and complete embedding of different access control logics
in simple type theory. Employing this framework we show that the off the shelf
theorem prover LEO-II can be applied to automate reasoning in prominent access
control logics.

energy band in solids from a many-particle point of view, originating in the
electron-electron interaction[1], and from a single particle point of view,
originating in the electron-ion interaction[2]. We proposed that
superconductivity in solids only occurs when the Fermi level is close to the
top of a band (hole carriers), that it originates in `undressing' of carriers
from $both$ the electron-electron and the electron-ion interaction, and that as
a consequence holes in the normal state behave like electrons in the
superconducting state[3]. However, the connection between both undressing
effects was left unclear, as was left unclear how the transformation from hole
behavior to electron behavior occurs. Here we clarify these questions by
showing that the same electron-electron interaction physics that promotes
pairing of hole carriers and undressing of carriers from the electron-electron
interaction leads to undressing of carriers from the electron-ion interaction
and transforms the behavior of carriers from hole-like to electron-like.
Furthermore this phenomenon is connected with the expulsion of negative charge
that we predict to occur in superconductors. These unexpected connections
support the validity of our theoretical framework, the theory of hole
superconductivity, to explain superconductivity in solids.

quantum vacuum and discuss the different contributions to the vacuum energy
density arising from different sectors of the standard model. Next, in chapter
two, we discuss cosmology and the introduction of the cosmological constant
into Einstein's field equations. In chapter three we explore the Casimir effect
and study a number of mathematical techniques used to obtain a finite physical
result for the Casimir energy. We also review the experiments that have
verified the Casimir force. In chapter four we discuss the introduction of
extra dimensions into physics. We begin by reviewing Kaluza Klein theory, and
then discuss three popular higher dimensional models: bosonic string theory,
large extra dimensions and warped extra dimensions. Chapter five is devoted to
an original derivation of the Casimir energy we derived for the scenario of a
higher dimensional vector field coupled to a scalar field in the fifth
dimension. In chapter six we explore a range of vacuum scenarios and discuss
research we have performed regarding moduli stability. Chapter seven explores a
novel approach to spacecraft propulsion we have proposed based on the idea of
manipulating the extra dimensions of string/M theory. Finally, in chapter 8, we
discuss some issues in heterotic string phenomenology derived from the free
fermionic approach.

that the SSBR sensor and scaffold proteins poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and
XRCC1 facilitate accumulation of chromatin assembly factor-1 (CAF-1) at sites
of oxidative DNA strand breakage, which in turn mediates the deposition of
Histone H3.1. We also demonstrate that depletion of CAF-1 slows global rates of
DNA strand break repair in quiescent cells following oxidative stress,
demonstrating that single-strand break repair and histone deposition are
tightly coordinated processes. These data describe a novel role for the DNA
singlestrand break repair machinery and implicate histone turnover as a core

catalogue we consider the various properties of the giant radio sources (gRS)

optical bands, yielding the following results: 1. The fraction of broad line
objects among gRSs with high excitation spectrum is the same as for the RSs
from isotropic samples. According to Unified Scheme this leads to the isotropic
angle distribution of gRSs jets, thus gRSs cannot be characterized as objects
with jets lying in the plane of sky. 2. gRSs do not differ from normal sized
RSs in apparent asymmetry distribution of their extended radio components
(ERC). However the fact that asymmetry distributions for gRSs and giant radio
quasars (gQSS) are essentially the same leads within the Unification Scheme to
the conclusion that the origin of this asymmetry is in the non-uniform
environment. 3. The richness of the environment for gRSs is the same as for
normal sized RSs. This contradicts the opinion that the low density of the
environment is the single reason for gRSs formation. 4. About 10% of FRII RSs
have by order of magnitude longer lifetimes and eventually evolve to gRSs. 5.
The observed relative quantity of radio quasars in gRSs population (~0.1) can
be interpreted as the presence of long-living population of radio loud QSSs as

nucleus at a very low level of activity. Its radio through submm-wave emission
is known to come from a region close to the event horizon, however, the source
of the emission is still under debate. A successful theory explaining the
emission is based on a relativistic jet model scaled down from powerful
quasars. We want to test the predictive power of this established jet model
against newly available measurements of wavelength-dependent time lags and the
size-wavelength structure in Sgr A*. Using all available closure amplitude VLBI
data from different groups, we again derived the intrinsic wavelength-dependent
size of Sgr A*. This allowed us to calculate the expected frequency-dependent
time lags of radio flares, assuming a range of in- and outflow velocities.
Moreover, we calculated the time lags expected in the previously published
pressure-driven jet model. The predicted lags are then compared to radio
monitoring observations at 22, 43, and 350 GHz. The combination of time lags
and size measurements imply a mildly relativistic outflow with bulk outflow
speeds of gamma*beta ~ 0.5-2. The newly measured time lags are reproduced well
by the jet model without any major fine tuning. The results further strengthen
the case for the cm-to-mm wave radio emission in Sgr A* as coming from a mildly
relativistic jet-like outflow. The combination of radio time lag and VLBI
closure amplitude measurements is a powerful new tool for assessing the flow
speed and direction in Sgr A*. Future VLBI and time lag measurements over a
range of wavelengths will reveal more information about Sgr A*, such as the
existence of a jet nozzle, and measure the detailed velocity structure of a
relativistic jet near its launching point for the first time.

developed and succeeded in solar system, astrophysical and cosmological scales
without dark matter [J. W. Moffat, J. Cosmol. Astropart. Phys. 03, 004 (2006)].
However, two assumptions have been used: (i) $B(r)=A^{-1}(r)$, where $B(r)$ and
$A(r)$ are $g_{00}$ and $g_{rr}$ in the Schwarzschild coordinates (static and
spherically symmetric); (ii) scalar field $G=Const.$ in the solar system. These
two assumptions actually imply that the standard parametrized post-Newtonian
parameter $\gamma=1$. In this paper, we relax these two assumptions and study
STVG further by using the post-Newtonian (PN) approximation approach. With
abandoning the assumptions, we find $\gamma\neq1$ in general cases of STVG.
Then, a version of modified STVG (MSTVG) is proposed through introducing a
coupling function of scalar field G: $\theta(G)$. We have derived the metric
and equations of motion (EOM) in 1PN for general matter without specific
equation of state and $N$ point masses firstly. Subsequently, the secular
periastron precession $\dot{\omega}$ of binary pulsars in harmonic coordinates

the polygon between triplets and quadruplets of events in the HiRes data. The

luminosities L_X ~ 4 x 10^{40} erg/s (0.3-10 keV band). In 2007, they were in a
lower state (L_X ~ 5 x 10^{39} erg/s, and L_X ~ 1.5 x 10^{39} erg/s for X1 and
X2, respectively). Their X-ray spectra were dominated by power-laws with photon
indices Gamma ~ 1.8 and Gamma ~ 1.2, respectively. Thus, their spectra were
similar to those at their outburst peaks. Both sources have been seen to vary
by a factor of 20 in luminosity over the years, but their spectra are always
dominated by a hard power-law; unlike most stellar-mass BHs, they have never
been found in a canonical high/soft state dominated by a standard disk. The
lack of a canonical high/soft state seems to be a common feature of ULXs. We
speculate that the different kind of donor star and/or a persistently
super-Eddington accretion rate during their outbursts may prevent accretion
flows in ULXs from settling into steady standard disks.

advertiser to target a large number of queries while bidding only on a limited
number. While giving more expressiveness to advertisers, this feature makes it
challenging to optimize bids to maximize their returns: choosing to bid on a
query as a broad match because it provides high profit results in one bidding
for related queries which may yield low or even negative profits.
  We abstract and study the complexity of the {\em bid optimization problem}
which is to determine an advertiser's bids on a subset of keywords (possibly
using broad match) so that her profit is maximized. In the query language model
when the advertiser is allowed to bid on all queries as broad match, we present
an linear programming (LP)-based polynomial-time algorithm that gets the
optimal profit. In the model in which an advertiser can only bid on keywords,
ie., a subset of keywords as an exact or broad match, we show that this problem
is not approximable within any reasonable approximation factor unless P=NP. To
deal with this hardness result, we present a constant-factor approximation when
the optimal profit significantly exceeds the cost. This algorithm is based on
rounding a natural LP formulation of the problem. Finally, we study a budgeted
variant of the problem, and show that in the query language model, one can find
two budget constrained ad campaigns in polynomial time that implement the
optimal bidding strategy. Our results are the first to address bid optimization
under the broad match feature which is common in ad auctions.

the behaviors of carbon nanotubes in biological systems. Ultra-sensitive
detection of biological species with carbon nanotubes can be realized after
surface passivation to inhibit the non-specific binding of bio-molecules on the
hydrophobic nanotube surface. Electrical nanosensors based on nanotubes provide
a label-free approach to biological detections. Surface enhanced Raman
spectroscopy of CNT opens up a method of protein microarray with down to 1 fM
detection sensitivity. In vitro and in vivo toxicity studies reveal that well
water soluble and serum stable nanotubes are biocompatible, non-toxic and
potentially useful for biomedical applications. In vivo biodistributions vary
with the functionalization and possibly also sizes of nanotubes, with a
tendency of accumulation in the reticuloendothelial systems, including the
liver and spleen, after intravenous administration. If well functionalized,
nanotubes may be excreted mainly through the biliary pathway in feces. Carbon
nanotube-based drug delivery has shown promises in various in vitro and in vivo
experiments including delivery pf small interfering RNA, paclitaxel and
doxorubicin. Moreover, SWNTs with various interesting intrinsic optical

light deficit L_def/L correlates with MBH/M, the ratio of BH mass to the galaxy
stellar mass. All three correlations have scatter similar to or smaller than
the scatter in the well known correlation between MBH and sigma. The new
correlations are remarkable in view of the dichotomy between ellipticals with
cores and those with central extra light. Core light deficit correlates closely
with MBH and sigma, but extra light does not. This supports the suggestion that
extra light Es are made in wet mergers with starbursts whereas core Es are made
in dry mergers. After dry mergers, cores are believed to be scoured by BH
binaries that fling stars away as their orbits decay or by BHs that sink back
to the center after recoiling from anisotropic gravitational radiation emitted
when they merge. Direct evidence has been elusive. We interpret the new
correlations as the ""smoking gun"" that connects cores with BHs. Together, the

factors, including stellar population properties, IMF, rotational support,
luminosity profile non-homology and dark matter (DM) fraction. We evaluate the
impact of all these factors using a large uniform dataset of local ETGs from
Prugniel & Simien (1997). We take particular care in estimating the stellar
masses, using a general star formation history, and comparing different
population synthesis models. We find that the stellar M/L contributes little to
the tilt. We estimate the total M/L using simple Jeans dynamical models, and
find that adopting accurate luminosity profiles is important but does not
remove the need for an additional tilt component, which we ascribe to DM. We
survey trends of the DM fraction within one effective radius, finding it to be
roughly constant for galaxies fainter than $M_B \sim -20.5$, and increasing
with luminosity for the brighter galaxies; we detect no significant differences
among S0s and fast- and slow-rotating ellipticals. We construct simplified
cosmological mass models and find general consistency, where the DM transition
point is caused by a change in the relation between luminosity and effective
radius. A more refined model with varying galaxy star formation efficiency
suggests a transition from total mass profiles (including DM) of faint galaxies
distributed similarly to the light, to near-isothermal profiles for the bright
galaxies. These conclusions are sensitive to various systematic uncertainties
which we investigate in detail, but are consistent with the results of dynamics

cosmic star-formation history from the empirical modeling of mid- and
far-infrared data. We perform a non-parametric inversion of galaxy counts at
15, 24, 70, 160, and 850 microns simultaneously. It is a ""blind"" search (no
redshift information is required) of all possible evolutions of the infrared
luminosity function of galaxies, from which the evolution of the star-formation
rate density and its uncertainties are derived. The cosmic infrared background
(CIRB) measurements are used a posteriori to tighten the range of solutions.
The inversion relies only on two hypotheses: (1) the luminosity function
remains smooth both in redshift and luminosity, (2) a set of infrared spectral
energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies must be assumed. The range of
star-formation histories that we derive is well constrained and consistent with
redshift-based measurements from deep surveys. The redshift decompositions of
the counts are also recovered successfully. Therefore, multi-wavelength counts
and CIRB (both projected observations) alone seem to contain enough information
to recover the cosmic star-formation history with quantifiable errors. A peak
of the SFRD at z~2 is preferred, although higher redshifts are not excluded. We
also find a good consistency between the observed evolution of the stellar mass
density and the prediction from our model. Finally, the inability of the
inversion to model perfectly and simultaneously all the multi-wavelength
infrared counts (especially at 160 microns where an excess is seen around 20
mJ) implies either (i) the existence of a sub-population of colder galaxies,

100 meV and up to the maximum energy of 200 meV are however broader in energy

is a sum of squares of polynomials (SOS). The latter problem is now known to be
reducible to a semidefinite programming (SDP) computation much faster than
classical algebraic methods, thus enabling new speed-ups in algebraic
optimization. However, exactly how often nonnegative polynomials are in fact
sums of squares of polynomials remains an open problem. Blekherman was recently
able to show that for degree k polynomials in n variables -- with k>=4 fixed --
those that are SOS occupy a vanishingly small fraction of those that are
nonnegative on R^n, as n tends to infinity.
  With an eye toward the case of small n, we refine Blekherman's bounds by
incorporating the underlying Newton polytope, simultaneously sharpening some of
his older bounds along the way. Our refined asymptotics show that certain
Newton polytopes may lead to families of polynomials where efficient SDP can

helicity fluxes are responsible for the success of some of the recent
large-scale dynamo simulations. These fluxes help in disposing of excess
small-scale magnetic helicity. This small-scale magnetic helicity, in turn, is
generated in response to the production of an overall tilt in each Parker loop.
Some preliminary calculations of this helicity flux are presented for a system
with uniform shear. In the Sun the effects of magnetic helicity fluxes may be
seen in coronal mass ejections shedding large amounts of magnetic helicity.

higher representation QCD. Ordinary QCD is a SU(n) gauge theory with n_f Dirac
quarks in the fundamental representation. Changing the representation of quarks
leads to different and interesting theories, which are not as well studied as
ordinary QCD. In order to be able to have a consistent asymptotically free
large n limit, we must limit ourselves to three cases: two-index representation
(symmetric or anti-symmetric) and adjoint representation. Skyrmions of the
low-energy effective Lagrangian shall be the main subject of this review. There
are puzzling aspects, both in orientifold and adjoint QCD, regarding the
identification of the Skyrmion and its quantum stability, that have not yet
been understood. We shall explain these problems and the solution we proposed
for them. The first part is dedicated to the two-index representation. Here the
challenge is to identify the correct particle in the spectrum that has to be
identified with the Skyrmion. It turns out not to be the simplest baryon (as in
ordinary QCD) but a baryonic state with higher charge, precisely composed by
n(n\pm 1)/2 quarks. Although not the simplest among the baryons, it is the one
that minimizes the mass per unit of baryonic charge and thus is the most stable
among them. The second part is devoted to the quarks in the adjoint
representation. The task here assume a different perspective. We do not have a
baryon charge, like in ordinary QCD. An important role is now played by a
massive fermion that must be considered in the low-energy effective Lagrangian.
Through this fermion, the Skyrmion acquires an anomalous fermionic number
(-1)^F and, as a consequence, an odd relationship between the latter and its
spin/statistic. This implies a Z_2 stability of the Skyrmion.

super-fast at almost all latitudes, while for lower spindown powers (~ 10^{50}

superconductor with hole carriers, which are introduced into CuO_2 planes by an
unexpected deviation from the nominal content of apical fluorines. In a
previous paper, we proposed a self-doping mechanism as the origin of carrier

superconducting and magnetic properties in n=3 and n=4 by Cu-NMR/NQR and F-NMR.
The extensive NMR studies have confirmed that the apical-fluorine compounds are
not self-doped but hole-doped, and that antiferromagnetism (AFM) and
superconductivity (SC) coexist in a single CuO_2 plane. In n=4, the AFM
ordering occurs at T_N = 80 K, well above T_c=55 K, where the respective AFM
moments are M_AFM=0.11 mu_B and 0.18 mu_B at the OP and the IP. In n=3, on the
other hand, the underdoped single IP exhibits a spontaneous moment M_AFM=0.12
mu_B at low temperatures and a peak in the nuclear-spin-lattice relaxation rate
1/T_1 of F at T_N=23 K, much lower than T_c = 76 K. We note that the increase
in the number of IPs from one to two leads to an increase in T_N due to
strengthening the interlayer coupling, although the doping levels for both
compounds are almost comparable. The present results strongly suggest that the
uniform mixing of AFM and SC is a general property inherent to a single CuO_2
plane in the underdoped regime for hole-doping.

into two parts. One has no contribution to the net momentum due to the
transversality condition. The other yields all the momentum. The angular
momentum that originates from the former part is spin, and the angular momentum
that originates from the latter part is orbital angular momentum. Expressions
for the spin and orbital angular momentum are given in terms of the electric
vector in reciprocal space. The spin and orbital angular momentum defined this
way are used to investigate the angular momentum of nonparaxial beams that are
described in a recently published paper [Phys. Rev. A 78, 063831 (2008)]. It is
found that the orbital angular momentum depends, apart from an $l$-dependent
term, on two global quantities, the polarization represented by a generalized
Jones vector and a new characteristic represented by a unit vector
$\mathbf{I}$, though the spin depends only on the polarization. The
polarization dependence of orbital angular momentum through the effect of
$\mathbf{I}$ is obtained and discussed. Some applications of the result
obtained here are also made. The fact that the spin originates from the part of
momentum density that has no contribution to the net momentum is used to show
that there does not exist the paradox on the spin of circularly polarized plane

shown to be the origin of conversion from the spin of a paraxial
Laguerre-Gaussian beam into the orbital angular momentum of the focused beam

approaches is interesting because it shows the dependency of the amplification
level on such parameters as wave velocity in surface soil layers, velocity
contrast with deep layers, seismic wave type, incidence and damping. In this
specific area of Nice, a one-dimensional (1D) analytical analysis of
amplification does not give a satisfactory estimation of the maximum reached
levels. A boundary element model is then proposed considering different wave
types (SH, P, SV) as the seismic loading. The alluvial basin is successively
assumed as an isotropic linear elastic medium and an isotropic linear
viscoelastic solid (standard solid). The thickness of the surface layer, its
mechanical properties, its general shape as well as the seismic wave type
involved have a great influence on the maximum amplification and the frequency
for which it occurs. For real earthquakes, the numerical results are in very
good agreement with experimental measurements for each motion component.

hydrodynamic equations, we study the dynamics of a phase transition in the
dense core of isolated rotating neutron stars, triggered by the back bending
instability reached via angular momentum loss. In particular, we investigate
the dynamics of a migration from an unstable configuration into a stable one,
which leads to a mini-collapse of the neutron star and excites sizeable
pulsations in its bulk until it acquires a new stable equilibrium state. We
consider equations of state with softening at high densities, a simple analytic
one with a mixed hadron-quark phase in an intermediate pressure interval and
pure quark matter at very high densities, and a microphysical one that has a
first-order phase transition, originating from kaon condensation. Although the
marginally stable initial models are rigidly rotating, we observe that during
the collapse (albeit little) differential rotation is created. We analyze the
emission of gravitational radiation, which in some models is amplified by mode
resonance effects, and assess its prospective detectability by interferometric
detectors. We expect that the most favorable conditions for dynamic migration
exist in very young magnetars. We find that the damping of the post-migration
pulsations strongly depends on the character of the equation of state
softening. The damping of pulsations in the models with the microphysical
equation of state is caused by dissipation associated with matter flowing
through the density jump at the edge of the dense core. If at work, this
mechanism dominates over all other types of dissipation, like bulk viscosity in
the exotic-phase core, gravitational radiation damping, or numerical viscosity.

the evolution of a two dimensional minisuperspace cosmological model in
classical and quantum regimes. The phase space variables turn out to correspond
to the scale factor of a flat FRW model with a positive cosmological constant
and a dilatonic field with which the action of the model is augmented. The
exact classical and quantum solutions in commutative and noncommutative cases
are presented. We also obtain some approximate analytical solutions for the
corresponding classical and quantum cosmology in the presence of the deformed
Heisenberg relations between the phase space variables, in the limit where the
minisuperspace variables are small. These results are compared with the
standard commutative and noncommutative cases and similarities and differences
of these solutions are discussed.

proton transfer reaction is reported for Pyrrole 2-Carboxyldehyde (PCL). Steady
state absorption and emission measurements are conducted in PCL. The
theoretical investigation is done by using different quantum mechanical methods
(e.g. Hartree Fock, DFT, MP2, CCSD etc.). The reaction pathway and two
dimensional potential energy surfaces are computed in various level of theory.
A transition state is also reported in gas phase and reaction filed
calculation. It is established that PCL forms different emitting species in
different media. A large Stokes shifted emission band, which is attributed to
species undergoing excited state intramolecular proton transfer, is observed in
hydrocarbon solvent. Intermolecular proton transfer is observed in hydroxylic
polar solvent. Experimental observations yield all possible signatures of
intramolecular and intermolecular proton transfer in excited state of PCL. The
origins of these signatures have been explained successfully using
corresponding quantum mechanical theories.

that a certain characteristic subgroup X(S) of S always contains the Thompson

Oliver's conjecture as a statement about the representation theory of the
factor group S/X(S). We now verify the conjecture for a wide variety of groups
S/X(S).

of jets. The largest of these three, J0200+4049, exhibits a depression in the
centre of the western lobe, while J0139+3957 and J0807+7400 have been suggested
earlier by Klein et al. and Lara et al. respectively to be relic radio sources.
We estimate the ages of the lobes. We also present Very Large Array (VLA)
observations of the core of J0807+7400, and determine the core radio spectra
for all three sources. Although the radio cores suggest that the sources are
currently active, we explore the possibility that the lobes in these sources
are due to an earlier cycle of activity.

Accepted in WSDM 2009 Late Breaking Results","WSDM 2009 Late Breaking Results",,,"cs.HC cs.CY cs.IR cs.MA physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Analysis of aggregate Web traffic has shown that PageRank is a poor model of
how people actually navigate the Web. Using the empirical traffic patterns
generated by a thousand users over the course of two months, we characterize
the properties of Web traffic that cannot be reproduced by Markovian models, in
which destinations are independent of past decisions. In particular, we show
that the diversity of sites visited by individual users is smaller and more
broadly distributed than predicted by the PageRank model; that link traffic is
more broadly distributed than predicted; and that the time between consecutive
visits to the same site by a user is less broadly distributed than predicted.
To account for these discrepancies, we introduce a more realistic navigation
model in which agents maintain individual lists of bookmarks that are used as
teleportation targets. The model can also account for branching, a traffic
property caused by browser features such as tabs and the back button. The model
reproduces aggregate traffic patterns such as site popularity, while also
generating more accurate predictions of diversity, link traffic, and return
time distributions. This model for the first time allows us to capture the
extreme heterogeneity of aggregate traffic measurements while explaining the
more narrowly focused browsing patterns of individual users.
