(SWCNTs), isolated in vacuum or a medium, and their contributions to the
optical spectra of nanotubes are studied within the elementary potential model,
in which an exciton is represented as a bound state of two oppositely charged
quasi-particles confined to the nanotube surface. The emphasis is given on the
influence of dielectric environment surrounding a nanotube on the exciton
spectra. For nanotubes in environment with permittivity less than 1.8 the
ground-state exciton binding energies exceed the respective energy gaps, while
the obtained binding energies of excitons in nanotubes in a medium with
permittivity greater than 4 are in good accordance with the corresponding
experimental data and consistent with known scaling relation for the
environmental effect. The stabilization process of single-electron spectrum in
SWCNTs in media with rather low permittivities is discussed.

of the structural configurations of Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) phases in

can be pursued for RP phases of any AFD perovskite system. We systematically
investigate the effects of oxygen octahedral rotations on the energies of RP
phases in AFD perovskites (A_n+1 B_n O_3n+1) for n = 1...30, providing
asymptotic results for n --> infinity that give both the form of the
interaction between stacking faults and the behavior of such stacking faults in
isolation. We find an inverse-distance interaction between faults with a
strength which varies by as much as a factor of two depending on the
configuration of the octahedra. We find that the strength of this effect can be
sufficient to (a) stabilize or destabilize the RP phase with respect to
dissociation into the bulk perovskite and the bulk A-oxide and (b) affect the
energy scales of the RP phase sufficiently to constrain the rotational states
of the octahedra neighboring the stacking faults, even at temperatures where
the octahedra in the bulk regions librate freely. Finally, we present evidence
that the importance of the octahedral rotations can be understood in terms of
changes in the distances between oxygen ions on opposing sides of the RP
stacking faults.

Multiple Access Channel (GMAC) with finite complex input alphabets and
continuous output are computed in this paper. When both the users employ the
same code alphabet, it is well known that an appropriate rotation between the
alphabets provides unique decodability to the receiver. For such a set-up, a
metric is proposed to compute the angle(s) of rotation between the alphabets
such that the CC capacity region is maximally enlarged. Subsequently, code
pairs based on Trellis Coded Modulation (TCM) are designed for the two-user
GMAC with $M$-PSK and $M$-PAM alphabet pairs for arbitrary values of $M$ and it
is proved that, for certain angles of rotation, Ungerboeck labelling on the
trellis of each user maximizes the guaranteed squared Euclidean distance of the
\textit{sum trellis}. Hence, such a labelling scheme can be used systematically
to construct trellis code pairs for a two-user GMAC to achieve sum rates close
to the sum capacity of the channel. More importantly, it is shown for the first
time that ML decoding complexity at the destination is significantly reduced
when $M$-PAM alphabet pairs are employed with \textit{almost} no loss in the
sum capacity. \indent A two-user Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) fading
MAC with $N_{t}$ antennas at both the users and a single antenna at the
destination has also been considered with the assumption that the destination
has the perfect knowledge of channel state information and the two users have
the perfect knowledge of only the phase components of their channels. For such
a set-up, two distinct classes of Space Time Block Code (STBC) pairs derived
from the well known class of real orthogonal designs are proposed such that the
STBC pairs are information lossless and have low ML decoding complexity.

accumulates in the same cluster. Numerical data proposes that this cluster
formation will occur at all densities for large system sizes. Coupling of
several filaments leads to an enhanced cluster formation compared to the

latter can assume the value -1 (+1 is their vacuum value) for a discrete set of
frequencies, i.e., for these frequencies the medium behaves as a negative index
material (NIM). We show that such systems have a well-defined time evolution.
In particular the fields remain square integrable (and the electromagnetic
energy finite) if this is the case at some initial time. Next we turn to the
Green's function (a tensor), associated with the electric Helmholtz operator,
for a set of parallel layers filled with a material. We express it in terms of
the well-known scalar s and p ones. For a half space filled with the material
and with a single dispersive Lorentz form for both electric and magnetic
permeabilities we obtain an explicit form for the Green's function. We find the
usual behavior for negative index materials, there is no refection outside the
evanescent regime and the transmission (refraction) shows the usual NIM

modulation of the radiative decay probability of an excited atom. The formalism

absolute magnitude selected samples from the Groth strip in the GOYA

(i) we avoid morphological K-corrections, (ii) we measure asymmetries in
artificially redshifted to z_d = 0.75 galaxies to lead with loss of
morphological information with redshift, and (iii) we take into account the
observational errors in z and A, that tend to overestimate the merger fraction,
by maximum likelihood techniques. We find: (i) our data allow for a robust
merger fraction to be provided for a single redshift bin centered at z=0.6.
(ii) Merger fractions have low values: f_m = 0.045 for M_B <= -20 galaxies, and
f_m = 0.031 for M_Ks <= -23.5 galaxies. And, (iii) failure to address the
effects of the observational errors leads to overestimating f_m by factors of
10%-60%. Combining our results with those on literature, and parameterizing the
merger fraction evolution as f_m(z) = f_m(0)(1+z)^m, we obtain that m = 2.9 +-

a maximum brightness, M_V ~ -12 to -13, intermediate between classical novae
and supernovae. We present ground-based photometric and spectroscopic
monitoring and adaptive-optics imaging of the OT, as well as pre- and
post-outburst space-based imaging with HST and Spitzer. The optical spectrum at
maximum showed an F-type supergiant photosphere with superposed emission lines
of hydrogen, Ca II, and [Ca II], similar to the spectra of low-luminosity Type
IIn ""supernova impostors"" like SN 2008S, as well as cool hypergiants like IRC
+10420. The emission lines have a complex, double structure, indicating a
bipolar outflow with velocities of ~75 km/s. The luminous energy released in
the eruption was ~10^47 ergs, most of it emitted in the first 2 months. By
registering new HST images with deep archival frames, we have precisely located
the OT site, and find no detectable optical progenitor brighter than broad-band
V magnitude 28.5. However, archival Spitzer images reveal a bright,
non-variable mid-IR pre-outburst source. We conclude that the NGC 300 OT was a
heavily dust-enshrouded luminous star, of ~10-15 Msun, which experienced an
eruption that cleared the surrounding dust and initiated a bipolar wind. The
progenitor was likely an OH/IR source which had begun to evolve on a blue loop
toward higher temperatures, but the precise cause of the outburst remains
uncertain.

$u_{A,i}$ for item $i$, our goal is to allocate items to agents to maximize
fairness. Specifically, the utility of an agent is the sum of its utilities for
items it receives, and we seek to maximize the minimum utility of any agent.
While this problem has received much attention recently, its approximability
has not been well-understood thus far: the best known approximation algorithm
achieves an $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{m})$-approximation, and in contrast, the best
known hardness of approximation stands at 2.
  Our main result is an approximation algorithm that achieves an
$\tilde{O}(n^{\eps})$ approximation for any $\eps=\Omega(\log\log n/\log n)$ in
time $n^{O(1/\eps)}$. In particular, we obtain poly-logarithmic approximation
in quasi-polynomial time, and for any constant $\eps > 0$, we obtain
$O(n^{\eps})$ approximation in polynomial time. An interesting aspect of our
algorithm is that we use as a building block a linear program whose integrality
gap is $\Omega(\sqrt m)$. We bypass this obstacle by iteratively using the
solutions produced by the LP to construct new instances with significantly
smaller integrality gaps, eventually obtaining the desired approximation.
  We also investigate the special case of the problem, where every item has a
non-zero utility for at most two agents. We show that even in this restricted
setting the problem is hard to approximate upto any factor better tha 2, and
show a factor $(2+\eps)$-approximation algorithm running in time
$poly(n,1/\eps)$ for any $\eps>0$. This special case can be cast as a graph
edge orientation problem, and our algorithm can be viewed as a generalization
of Eulerian orientations to weighted graphs.

single-walled carbon nanotubes, we demonstrate that there is an upper limit on

increases, all photoluminescence emission peaks arising from different
chirality single-walled carbon nanotubes showed clear saturation in intensity.
Each peak exhibited a saturation value that was independent of the excitation
wavelength, indicating that there is an upper limit on the excitonic density
for each nanotube species. We propose that this saturation behavior is a result
of efficient exciton-exciton annihilation through which excitons decay
non-radiatively. In order to explain the experimental results and obtain
excitonic densities in the saturation regime, we have developed a model, taking
into account the generation, diffusion-limited exciton-exciton annihilation,
and spontaneous decays of one-dimensional excitons. Using the model, we were
able to reproduce the experimentally obtained saturation curves under certain
approximations, from which the excitonic densities were estimated. The validity
of the model was confirmed through comparison with Monte Carlo simulations.
Finally, we show that the conventional rate equation for exciton-exciton
annihilation without taking into account exciton diffusion fails to fit the
experimentally observed saturation behavior, especially at high excitonic
densities.

equivalent to the asymptotically flat exterior of a white hole, and the

to be the main reason for MSD. Posture analysis techniques have been used to
expose MSD risks of the work, but most of the conventional methods are only
suitable for static posture analysis. Meanwhile the subjective influences from

disadvantage is that the evaluation has to be taken place in the workshop, so
it is impossible to avoid some design defects before data collection in the
field environment and it is time consuming. In order to enhance the efficiency
of ergonomic MSD risk evaluation and avoid subjective influences, we develop a
new muscle fatigue model and a new fatigue index to evaluate the human muscle
fatigue during manual handling jobs in this paper. Our new fatigue model is
closely related to the muscle load during working procedure so that it can be
used to evaluate the dynamic working process. This muscle fatigue model is
mathematically validated and it is to be further experimental validated and
integrated into a virtual working environment to evaluate the muscle fatigue

For this purpose we use our non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) wind
code with inclusion of additional artificial source of X-rays, assumed to
originate in the wind shocks.
  We show that the influence of shock X-ray emission on wind mass-loss rate is
relatively small. Wind terminal velocity may be slightly influenced by the
presence of strong X-ray sources, especially for stars cooler than Teff < 35
000 K.
  We discuss the origin of the Lx/L \sim 10^-7 relation. For stars with thick
wind this relation can be explained assuming that the cooling time depends on
wind density. Stars with optically thin winds exhibiting the ""weak wind
problem"" display enhanced X-ray emission which may be connected with large
shock cooling length. We propose that this effect can explain the ""weak wind
problem"".
  Inclusion of X-rays leads to a better agreement of the model ionization
structure with observations. However, we do not found any significant influence
of X-rays on Pv ionization fraction implying that the presence of X-rays cannot
explain the Pv problem.
  We study the implications of modified ionization equilibrium due to shock
emission on the line transfer in the X-ray region. We conclude that the X-ray
line profiles of helium-like ions may be affected by the line absorption within
the cool wind.

improves on the standard mixture of normals by using information contained in

extension a {\em natural extension}. We study probability measures on the set
of natural extensions of a causal set, especially those measures having the
property of {\em order-invariance}: if we condition on the set of the bottom
$k$ elements of the natural extension, each possible ordering among these $k$
elements is equally likely. We give sufficient conditions for the existence and
uniqueness of an order-invariant measure on the set of natural extensions of a
causal set.

degrees of freedom of multiparticle objects like molecules, fullerens, atomic
nuclei, etc. Basing on some invariance properties under the action of isometric
and affine transformations we reviewed some new models of the mutual
interaction between rotational and deformative degrees of freedom. Our
methodology and some results may be useful in the theory of Raman scattering
and nuclear radiation.

impossible if G is prosoluble. We prove that such an image does not exist if G
is semisimple or nonuniversal. We also investigate the existense of dense
normal subgroups in $G$.
