protection against node and link failures essential in the deployment of
reliable networks. To prevent loss of data due to node failures, a network
protection strategy is proposed that aims to withstand such failures.
Particularly, a protection strategy against any single node failure is designed
for a given network with a set of $n$ disjoint paths between senders and
receivers. Network coding and reduced capacity are deployed in this strategy
without adding extra working paths to the readily available connection paths.
This strategy is based on protection against node failures as protection
against multiple link failures. In addition, the encoding and decoding
operational aspects of the premeditated protection strategy are demonstrated.

presented. In this work we analyze the impact of Kaluza-Klein (KK) gauge boson
modes on Delta F=2 observables, for the first time considering the full
operator basis and including NLO renormalization group running. It is pointed
out that the dominant contribution in the B-system does not come from the KK
gluon, but that contributions from KK excitations of the weak gauge bosons are
competitive. In a numerical analysis we assess the amount of fine-tuning
necessary for obtaining realistic values for quark masses and mixings and at
the same time realistic values for epsilon_K, the measure for CP violation in K
meson mixing. We are able to show that a mass of the lightest KK gauge boson of
2-3 TeV, and hence in the reach of the LHC, is still possible for moderate
fine-tuning. These results enable us to make predictions for not yet measured
Delta F=2 observables, such as S_\psi\phi and A_s^SL, which can differ
significantly from their SM values.

disks can exhibit recurrent coherent structures called channel flows. The
formation and destruction of these structures may play a role in the
development and saturation of MRI-induced turbulence, and consequently help us
understand the time-dependent accretion behaviour of certain astrophysical
objects. Previous investigations have revealed that channel solutions are
attacked by various parasitic modes, foremost of which is an analogue of the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. We revisit these instabilities and show how they
relate to the classical instabilities of plasma physics, the kink and pinch
modes. However, we argue that in most cases channels emerge from developed
turbulence and are eventually destroyed by turbulent mixing, not by the
parasites. The exceptions are the clean isolated channels which appear in
systems near criticality or which emerge from low amplitude initial conditions.
These structures inevitably achieve large amplitudes and are only then
destroyed, giving rise to eruptive behaviour.

to be expected. Normally CP is derived as the (small) difference of two large
numbers (LHC and RHC); hence an accurate calibration is absolutely necessary.
Our aim is to improve the calibration accuracy to include the Stokes parameter
V in the common single-dish polarimetric measurements, allowing a full Stokes
study of the source under examination. A detailed study, up to the 2nd order,
of the Mueller matrix elements in terms of cross-talk components allows us to
reach the accuracy necessary to study circular polarization. The new
calibration method has been applied to data taken at the 100-m Effelsberg
radio-telescope during regular test observations of extragalactic sources at
2.8, 3.6, 6 and 11 cm. The D-terms in phase and amplitude appear very stable
with time and the few known values of circular polarization have been
confirmed. It is shown that, whenever a classical receiver and a multiplying
polarimeter are available, the proposed calibration scheme allows one to
include Stokes V in standard single-dish polarimetric observations as
difference of two native circular outputs.

with their vast reservoirs of spectroscopically located and identified sources,
afford us the chance to more accurately study their real space correlations in
the hopes of identifying the physical processes that trigger quasar activity.
We have used these two public databases to measure the projected cross
correlation, $\omega_p$, between quasars and luminous red galaxies. We find the
projected two-point correlation to have a fitted clustering radius of $r_0, =
5.3 \pm 0.6 $ and a slope, $\gamma =1.83 \pm 0.42 $ on scales from
0.7-27$h^{-1}$Mpc.
  We attempt to understand this strong correlation by separating the LRG sample
into 2 populations of blue and red galaxies. We measure at the cross
correlation with each population. We find that these quasars have a stronger
correlation amplitude with the bluer, more recently starforming population in
our sample than the redder passively evolving population, which has a
correlation that is much more noisy and seems to flatten on scales $<
5h^{-1}$Mpc. We compare this result to published work on hierarchical models.
The stronger correlation of bright quasars with LRGs that have undergone a
recent burst of starformation suggests that the physical mechanisms that
produce both activities are related and that minor mergers or tidal effects may
be important triggers of bright quasar activity and/or that bright quasars are
less highly biased than faint quasars.

acoustic excitations with large wavelengths that are well described by plane
waves. This is the Debye model, which rests on the assumption that the medium
is an elastic continuum, holds true for acoustic wavelengths large on the
microscopic scale fixed by the interatomic spacing, and gradually breaks down
on approaching it. Glasses are characterized as well by universal
low-temperature thermal properties, that are however anomalous with respect to
those of the corresponding crystalline phases. Related universal anomalies also
appear in the low-frequency vibrational density of states and, despite of a
longstanding debate, still remain poorly understood. Using molecular dynamics
simulations of a model monatomic glass of extremely large size, we show that in
glasses the structural disorder undermines the Debye model in a subtle way: the
elastic continuum approximation for the acoustic excitations breaks down
abruptly on the mesoscopic, medium-range-order length-scale of about ten
interatomic spacings, where it still works well for the corresponding
crystalline systems. On this scale, the sound velocity shows a marked reduction
with respect to the macroscopic value. This turns out to be closely related to
the universal excess over the Debye model prediction found in glasses at
frequencies of ~1 THz in the vibrational density of states or at temperatures
of ~10 K in the specific heat.

the specific signatures imprinted on the abundances, parameters (such as
metallicity, mass, temperature, and neutron source) characterizing AGB
nucleosynthesis from the specific signatures imprinted on the abundances, and
separate them from the impact of thermohaline mixing, first dredge-up, and
dilution associated with the mass transfer from the companion.To put CEMP stars
in a broad context, we collect abundances for about 180 stars of various
metallicities, luminosity classes, and abundance patterns, from our own sample
and from literature. First, we show that there are CEMP stars which share the
properties of CEMP-s stars and CEMP-no stars (which we call CEMP-low-s stars).
We also show that there is a strong correlation between Ba and C abundances in
the s-only CEMP stars. This strongly points at the operation of the 13C neutron
source in low-mass AGB stars. For the CEMP-rs stars (seemingly enriched with
elements from both the s- and r-processes), the correlation of the N abundances
with abundances of heavy elements from the 2nd and 3rd s-process peaks bears
instead the signature of the 22Ne neutron source. Adding the fact that CEMP-rs
stars exhibit O and Mg enhancements, we conclude that extremely hot conditions
prevailed during the thermal pulses of the contaminating AGB stars. Finally, we
argue that most CEMP-no stars (with no overabundances for the neutron-capture
elements) are likely the extremely metal-poor counterparts of CEMP
neutron-capture-rich stars. We also show that the C enhancement in CEMP-no
stars declines with metallicity at extremely low metallicity ([Fe/H]~< -3.2).
This trend is not predicted by any of the current AGB models.

non-fragmenting disks hovering on the verge of gravitational instability -
using a realistic prescription for the effective viscosity caused by
gravitational torques. This prescription is based on a direct relationship
between the angular momentum transport in a thin accretion disk and the disk
cooling in a steady state. Assuming that opacity is dominated by dust we are
able to self-consistently derive disk properties for a given $\dot M$ assuming
marginal gravitational stability. We also allow external irradiation of the
disk and account for a non-zero background viscosity which can be due to the
MRI. Spatial transitions between different co-existing disk states (e.g.
between irradiated and self-luminous or between gravitoturbulent and viscous)
are described and the location of the boundary at which disk must fragment is
determined in a variety of situations. We demonstrate in particular that at low
enough $\dot M$ external irradiation stabilizes gravitoturbulent disk against
fragmentation all the way to infinity thus providing means of steady mass
transport to the central object. Implications of our results for the
possibility of planet formation by gravitational instability in protoplanetary

only, one finds that the Gamow-Teller matrix element is too large to describe
the known (very long) lifetime of 14-C. As a novel approach to the problem, we
invoke the chiral three-nucleon force (3NF) at leading order and derive from it
a density-dependent in-medium NN interaction. Including this effective
in-medium NN interaction, the Gamow-Teller matrix element vanishes for a
nuclear density close to that of saturated nuclear matter. The genuine
short-range part of the three-nucleon interaction plays a particularly
important role in this context, since the medium modifications to the pion
propagator and pion-nucleon vertex (due to the long-range 3NF) tend to cancel
out in the relevant observable. We discuss also uncertainties related to the
off-shell extrapolation of the in-medium NN interaction. Using the off-shell
behavior of V(low-k) as a guide, we find that these uncertainties are rather
small.

about by the decoupling of infrared singularities in space and time. The former

transverse component of the velocity field (vortices) unbind in space. The
latter on the other hand leads to a transition among excitations (warps) in the
longitudinal component of the velocity field, which unbind in time. The quantum
Ashkin-Teller model, with which the observed loop order in the Cuprates is
described maps in the critical regime to the quantum xy model. We also discuss

within a simplified analytical model, which has been evolved out of the Hubbard

1) in underdoped samples, the missing area integrals reveal a second energy
scale due to the pseudogap, not present at optimum or overdoping; 2) the real
part of the optical self-energy shows a large sharp peak, that emerges with the
opening of the pseudogap which exists within the superconducting state and
persists in the normal state; and 3) the amount of optical spectral weight
which is transferred to the condensate is greatly reduced by the presence of
the pseudogap as compared to the Fermi liquid case. These non-BCS features of
the superconducting state are in good qualitative agreement with a body of
experimental work on different cuprate systems and provide strong evidence from
optical conductivity that they are all a manifestation of the pseudogap energy
scale.

  This paper presents and evaluates the Circulate architecture which maintains
the robustness and simplicity of centralised orchestration, but facilitates
choreography by allowing services to exchange data directly with one another.
Circulate could be realised within any existing workflow framework, in this
paper, we focus on WS-Circulate, a Web services based implementation.
  Taking inspiration from the Montage workflow, a number of common workflow
patterns (sequence, fan-in and fan-out), input to output data size
relationships and network configurations are identified and evaluated. The
performance analysis concludes that a substantial reduction in communication
overhead results in a 2-4 fold performance benefit across all patterns. An
end-to-end pattern through the Montage workflow results in an 8 fold
performance benefit and demonstrates how the advantage of using the Circulate
architecture increases as the complexity of a workflow grows.

Brownian motion $B$ with arbitrary Hurst index $\alpha$ (in particular, for
$\alpha\le 1/4$, which was till now an open problem) by regularizing the
iterated integrals of the analytic approximation of $B$ defined in
\cite{Unt08}. The regularization procedure is applied to 'Fourier normal
ordered' iterated integrals obtained by permuting the order of integration so
that innermost integrals have highest Fourier modes. The algebraic properties
of this rough path are best understood using two Hopf algebras: the Hopf
algebra of decorated rooted trees \cite{ConKre98} for the multiplicative or
Chen property, and the shuffle algebra for the geometric or shuffle property.
The rough path lives in Gaussian chaos of integer orders and is shown to have
finite moments. As well-known, the construction of a rough path is the key to
defining a stochastic calculus and solve stochastic differential equations
driven by $B$. The article \cite{Unt09ter} gives a quick overview of the
method.

Validating and constraining these models is crucial for understanding the
physics and chemistry of planetary atmospheres in extreme environments.
Indications of the presence of water in the atmosphere of HD 189733b have
recently been found in transmission spectra, where the planet's atmosphere
selectively absorbs the light of the parent star, and in broadband photometry.
Here we report on the detection of strong water absorption in a high
signal-to-noise, mid-infrared emission spectrum of the planet itself. We find
both a strong downturn in the flux ratio below 10 microns and discrete spectral
features that are characteristic of strong absorption by water vapour. The
differences between these and previous observations are significant and admit
the possibility that predicted planetary-scale dynamical weather structures
might alter the emission spectrum over time. Models that match the observed
spectrum and the broadband photometry suggest that heat distribution from the
dayside to the night side is weak. Reconciling this with the high night side
temperature will require a better understanding of atmospheric circulation or
possible additional energy sources.

under slow variations of parameters which drive the system through a quantum
phase transition. The model without counterrotating terms and sweeped detuning
is seen in the contexts of a many-body generalization of the Landau-Zener model
and the dynamical passage through a second-order quantum phase transition
(QPT). Adiabaticity is destroyed when the parameter crosses a critical value.
Applying semiclassical analysis based on concepts of classical adiabatic
invariants and mapping to the second Painleve equation (PII), we derive a
formula which accurately describes particle distributions in the Hilbert space
at wide range of parameters and initial conditions of the system. We find
striking universal features in the particle distributions which can be probed
in an experiment on Feshbach resonance passage or a cavity QED experiment. The
dynamics is found to be crucially dependent on the direction of the sweep. The
model with counterrotating terms has been realized recently in an experiment
with ultracold atomic gases in a cavity. Its semiclassical dynamics is
described by a Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom. Passage through
a QPT corresponds to passage through a bifurcation, and can also be described
by PII (after averaging over fast variables), leading to similar universal
distributions. Under certain conditions, the Dicke model is reduced to the
Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model.

that all three mergers proceed along distinctly different directions, the
partial alignment of the merger axes points to a common origin in the

low temperature of 5.7 keV of one of these features suggest that the respective

stages. Looking beyond the triple merger, we find the large-scale filament to
not only provide a spatial as well as temporal arrow for the interpretation of

clusters of galaxies. We argue that cosmic ray diffusion is likely to be slow
compared to the buoyancy time on large length scales, so that cosmic rays are
effectively adiabatic. If the cosmic ray pressure $p_{cr}$ is $\gtrsim 25 %$ of
the thermal pressure, and the cosmic ray entropy ($p_{\rm cr}/\rho^{4/3}$;
$\rho$ is the thermal plasma density) decreases outwards, cosmic rays drive an
adiabatic convective instability analogous to Schwarzschild convection in
stars. Global simulations of galaxy cluster cores show that this instability
saturates by reducing the cosmic ray entropy gradient and driving efficient
convection and turbulent mixing. At larger radii in cluster cores, the thermal
plasma is unstable to the heat flux-driven buoyancy instability (HBI), a
convective instability generated by anisotropic thermal conduction and a
background conductive heat flux. Cosmic-ray driven convection and the HBI may
contribute to redistributing metals produced by Type 1a supernovae in clusters.
Our calculations demonstrate that adiabatic simulations of galaxy clusters can
artificially suppress the mixing of thermal and relativistic plasma;
anisotropic thermal conduction allows more efficient mixing, which may
contribute to cosmic rays being distributed throughout the cluster volume.

Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice within the framework of
spin-wave theory. The distinct features of spin-wave excitations in the
triangular-lattice antiferromagnet are (i) finite lifetime at zero temperature
due to spontaneous two-magnon decays, (ii) strong renormalization of magnon
energies with respect to the harmonic result, and (iii) logarithmic
singularities in the decay rate Gamma_k. Quantum corrections to the magnon
spectrum are obtained using both the on-shell and off-shell solutions of the
Dyson equation with the lowest-order magnon self-energy. At low-energies magnon
excitations remain well-defined albeit with the anomalous decay rate Gamma_k ~
k^2 at k->0 and Gamma_k ~ |k-Q_AF|^7/2 at k->Q_AF. At high energies, magnons
are heavily damped with the decay rate reaching (2 Gamma_k/E_k) ~ 0.3 for the
case S=1/2. The on-shell solution shows logarithmic singularities in Gamma_k
with the concomitant jump-like discontinuities in E_k along certain contours in
the momentum space. Such singularities are even more prominent in the magnon
spectral function A(k,w). Although the off-shell solution removes such
log-singularities, the decay rates remain strongly enhanced. We also discuss
the role of higher-order corrections and show that such singularities may lead
to complete disappearance of the spectrum in the vicinity of certain k-points.
The kinematic conditions for two-magnon decays are analyzed for various
generalizations of the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet as well as for the
XXZ model on a kagome lattice. Our results suggest that decays and
singularities in the spin-wave spectra must be ubiquitous in all these systems.

Ia between 2.6 and 2.9 times larger than before, reducing the statistical
uncertainty to the point where systematics play the largest role. We use four
light curve fitters to test for systematic differences: SALT, SALT2, MLCS2k2
(R_V=3.1), and MLCS2k2 (R_V=1.7). SALT produces high-redshift Hubble residuals
with systematic trends versus color and larger scatter than MLCS2k2. MLCS2k2
overestimates the intrinsic luminosity of SN Ia with 0.7 < Delta < 1.2. MLCS2k2
with R_V=3.1 overestimates host-galaxy extinction while R_V=1.7 does not. Our
investigation is consistent with no Hubble bubble. We also find that, after
light-curve correction, SN Ia in Scd/Sd/Irr hosts are intrinsically fainter
than those in E/S0 hosts by 2 sigma, suggesting that they may come from
different populations. We also find that SN Ia in Scd/Sd/Irr hosts have low
scatter (0.1 mag) and reddening. Current systematic errors can be reduced by
improving SN Ia photometric accuracy, by including the CfA3 sample to retrain
light-curve fitters, by combining optical SN Ia photometry with near-infrared
photometry to understand host-galaxy extinction, and by determining if
different environments give rise to different intrinsic SN Ia luminosity after

dimension of the X-ray source not larger than a few 10^13 cm and a distance of

single/multiple antennas. It is known that the MIMO secrecy capacity is
achievable with the optimal transmit covariance matrix that maximizes the
minimum difference between the channel mutual information of the secrecy user
and those of the eavesdroppers. The MIMO secrecy capacity computation can thus
be formulated as a non-convex max-min problem, which cannot be solved
efficiently by standard convex optimization techniques. To handle this
difficulty, we explore a relationship between the MIMO secrecy channel and the
recently developed MIMO cognitive radio (CR) channel, in which the
multi-antenna secondary user transmits over the same spectrum simultaneously
with multiple primary users, subject to the received interference power
constraints at the primary users, or the so-called ``interference temperature
(IT)'' constraints. By constructing an auxiliary CR MIMO channel that has the
same channel responses as the MIMO secrecy channel, we prove that the optimal
transmit covariance matrix to achieve the secrecy capacity is the same as that
to achieve the CR spectrum sharing capacity with properly selected IT
constraints. Based on this relationship, several algorithms are proposed to
solve the non-convex secrecy capacity computation problem by transforming it
into a sequence of CR spectrum sharing capacity computation problems that are
convex. For the case with single-antenna eavesdroppers, the proposed algorithms
obtain the exact capacity of the MIMO secrecy channel, while for the case with
multi-antenna eavesdroppers, the proposed algorithms obtain both upper and
lower bounds on the MIMO secrecy capacity.

protein structures is therefore a crucial task and has been extensively
investigated. Evaluating the similarity of two proteins can be done by finding
an optimal one-to-one matching between their components, which is equivalent to
identifying a maximum weighted clique in a specific ""alignment graph"". In this
paper we present a new integer programming formulation for solving such clique
problems. The model has been implemented using the ILOG CPLEX Callable Library.
In addition, we designed a dedicated branch and bound algorithm for solving the
maximum cardinality clique problem. Both approaches have been integrated in
VAST (Vector Alignment Search Tool) - a software for aligning protein 3D
structures largely used in NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology

timescale t_{k}<10^{-14} sec, with detailed balance between binary interactions
such as Compton, Bhabha and Moller scattering, and pair production and
annihilation. Later the electron-positron-photon plasma approaches thermal
equilibrium on a timescale t_{th}<10^{-12} sec, with detailed balance for all

details of the computational scheme used in [1], as well as generalize our
treatment, considering proton loading of the pair plasma. When proton loading
is large, protons thermalize first by proton-proton scattering, and then with
the electron-positron-photon plasma by proton-electron scattering. In the
opposite case of small proton loading proton-electron scattering dominates over
proton-proton one. Thus in all cases the plasma, even with proton admixture,
reaches thermal equilibrium configuration on a timescale t_{th}<10^{-11} sec.

rearrangements that take place during embryonic development or for cancer
progression. The measurement is realized with a parallel compression plate
tensiometer using the capillary laws. Although it was introduced more than a
decade ago, it is based on various geometrical or physical approximations.
Surprisingly, these approximations have never been tested. Using a novel
tensiometer, we compare the two currently used methods to measure tissue
surface tension and propose a third one, based on a local polynomial fit (LPF)
of the profile of compressed droplets or cell aggregates. We show the
importance of measuring the contact angle between the plate and the
drop/aggregate to obtain real accurate measurement of surface tension when
applying existing methods. We can suspect that many reported values of surface
tension are greatly affected because of not handling this parameter properly.
We show then the benefit of using the newly introduced LPF method, which is not
dependent on this parameter. These findings are confirmed by generating
numerically compressed droplet profiles and testing the robustness and the
sensitivity to errors of the different methods.

question in the practice of experimental particle physics. Specifically, the
need to evaluate the efficiency of the cuts for background removal, when they
are tested in a signal-free-background-only energy window, originates a
statistical problem which finds its natural framework in the ample family of
solutions for two classical, and closely related, questions, i.e. the
determination of confidence intervals for the parameter of a binomial
proportion and for the ratio of Poisson means. In this paper the problem is
first addressed from the traditional perspective, and afterwards naturally
evolved towards the introduction of non standard confidence intervals both for
the binomial and Poisson cases; in particular, special emphasis is given to the
intervals obtained through the application of the likelihood ratio ordering to
the traditional Neyman prescription for the confidence limits determination.
Due to their attractiveness in term of reduced length and of coverage
properties, the new intervals are well suited as interesting alternative to the
standard Clopper-Pearson PDG intervals.

closely follows the variations of traffic. When tested against real traffic
traces, the proposed on-line algorithm performs well in the sense that the
detection ratio of long flows by the algorithm over a long time period is quite
high. Beyond the identification of elephants, this same class of algorithms is
applied to the closely related problem of detection of anomalies in IP traffic,
e.g., SYN flood due for instance to attacks. An algorithm for detecting SYN and
volume flood anomalies in Internet traffic is designed. Experiments show that
an anomaly is detected in less than one minute and the targeted destinations

by dynamical friction in dwarf galaxies, and are presumed to fall into the

the problem has been proposed. If dwarf galaxies have a core dark matter halo
which has constant density distribution in its center, the effect of dynamical
friction will be weakened considerably, and GCs should be able to survive
beyond the age of the universe. Then, the solution argued that, in a cored dark
halo, the suppression of dynamical friction is caused by a new equilibrium
state constructed by the interaction between the halo and the GC, in which a
part of the halo rotates along with the GC (co-rotating state). In this study,
I tested whether the solution is reasonable and reconsidered why a constant
density, core halo suppresses dynamical friction, by means of N-body
simulations. As a result, I conclude that the true mechanism of suppressed
dynamical friction is not the co-rotating state, although a core halo can
actually suppress dynamical friction on GCs significantly.

techniques. Anisotropy of susceptibility extends far into the paramagnetic
temperature range. A principal source of anisotropy are anisotropic properties
of the involved octahedrally coordinated single Co(2+) ions, as confirmed by
angular-overlap-model calculations presented in this work. Incommensurate
antiferromagnetic order sets in at TN=34 K. Propagation vector is strongly
temperature dependent reaching k1=(0.9458(6), 0, 0.6026(5)) at 30 K. A
transition to a ferrimagnetic structure with k2=0 takes place at TC=27 K.
Magnetically ordered phase is characterized by very unusual anisotropy as well:
while M-H scans along b-axis reveals spectacularly rectangular but otherwise
standard ferromagnetic hysteresis loops, M-H studies along other two principal
axes are perfectly reversible, revealing very sharp spin flop (or spin flip)
transitions, like in a standard antiferromagnet (or metamagnet). Altogether,
the observed magnetic phenomenology is interpreted as an evidence of competing
magnetic interactions permeating the system, first of all of the single ion
anisotropy energy and the exchange interactions. Different coordinations of the
Co(2+)-ions involved in the low-symmetry C2/c structure of Co7(TeO3)4Br6 render
the exchange-interaction network very complex by itself. Temperature dependent
changes in the magnetic structure, together with an abrupt emergence of a
ferromagnetic component, are ascribed to continual spin reorientations
described by a multi-component, but yet unknown, spin Hamiltonian.

fluid dynamic drag and fluid-elastic stability characteristics. An experimental
campaign is undertaken that involves a cantilevered sheet in air flow
characterised by Reynolds numbers of order R=10^4-10^6. The properties of the
sheet include: constant mass per unit area; small but finite flexural rigidity;
varying aspect ratios from within the range 0.43<l/L<1, where L and l denote
the length and width respectively; and tension applied at the trailing edge.
The unique aspect of the present work is an investigation into the influence of
in-plane tension on both the fluid drag and fluid-elastic stability of the
sheet. In the absence of tension, the configuration resembles a flag and the
drag coefficient is observed to decrease with increasing aspect ratio and
Reynolds number. In the presence of tension, the fluid drag is significantly
reduced in the region below the critical flow velocity at which convected wave
instabilities appear. This critical flow velocity can be increased through the
moderate application of in-plane tension. Under lateral tension, the drag of
the sheet is given to good approximation by the turbulent boundary layer drag
law for a flat plate. Once stability is lost, however, the drag coefficient
increases rapidly with Reynolds number due to convected waves travelling over
the sheet's surface.

by-product of the effort to measure secular period changes in the p modes due
to evolutionary effects on a time scale of almost a decade, the O-C diagram has
revealed an additional sinusoidal component attributed to a periodic shift in
the light travel time caused by a planetary-mass companion around the sdB star
in a 3.2 yr orbit. In order to derive the mass of the companion object, it is
necessary to determine the orbital inclination. One promising possibility to do
this is to use the stellar inclination as a primer for the orbital orientation.
The stellar inclination can refer to the rotational or the pulsational axis,
which are assumed to be aligned, and can in turn then be derived by combining
measurements of v_(rot) and v_(rot)sin i. The former is in principle accessible
through rotational splitting in the photometric frequency spectrum (which has
however not been found for V391 Peg yet), while the projected rotational
velocity can be measured from the rotational broadening of spectral lines. The
latter must be deconvolved from the additional pulsational broadening caused by
the surface radial velocity variation in high S/N phase averaged spectra. This

between 0.5 and 0.8 M_sun, as derived from asteroseismic and spectroscopic
determinations. Such mass determinations are, however, themselves
model-dependent. Moreover, asteroseismically and spectroscopically determined

J212531.92-010745.9 is the first known PG 1159 star in a close binary with a
late-main-sequence companion allowing a dynamical mass determination. We have
obtained 14 Calar Alto spectra of SDSS J212531.92-010745.9 covering the full

With co-added phase-corrected spectra the spectral analysis of the PG 1159

modelled with PHOENIX, yielding constraints on radii, effective temperature and
separation of the system's components. The light curve of SDSS

that a narrow region of strong polymer extension (a birefringent strand) forms
downstream of the stagnation point in the UCM model and extensions, like the
FENE-P model. These strands are associated with the existence of an essential
singularity in the stresses, which is induced by the fact that the stagnation
point makes the convective term in the constitutive equation into a singular
point. We argue that the mechanism is quite general, so that all flows that
have a separatrix going away from the stagnation point exhibit some singular

recently discovered singular behaviour in purely elongational flows: the
underlying mechanism is the same while the different nature of the singular

orbiting a single star, and assume there are no non-Keplerian complications or
uncertainties. The real case can only be more difficult. We use periodograms
for discovery and least-squares fits for estimating the Keplerian parameters.
We find a completeness for detection compatible with estimates in the
literature. We find mass estimation by least squares to be biased, as has been
found for noisy radial-velocity data sets; this bias degrades the completeness
of accurate mass estimation. When we compare the true planetary position with
the position predicted from the fitted orbital parameters, at future times, we
find low completeness for an accuracy goal of 0.3 times the semimajor axis of
the planet, even with no delay following the end of astrometric observations.

spectra in the intermediate state can be described by a model containing a
blackbody component and hot thermal plasma. Contrary to the high state the
ratio between soft and hard X-ray flux is nearly balanced. In agreement with
previous measurements we observed a migration of the accretion spot and stream
towards the line connecting both stars. The brightness of HU Aqr was further
reduced by a factor of 80 during two low states in October 2003 and May 2005,

This luminosity would fit well with an active coronal emitter, but the
relatively high plasma temperatures of 3.5 and 2.0 keV are more compatible with
residual accretion. We updated the eclipse ephemeris of HU Aqr based on the
eclipse egress of the accretion spot measured in various wavelength bands. The
(O-C)-diagram of the observed accretion spot eclipse timings reveals complex
deviations from a linear trend, which can be explained by a constant or cyclic
period change or a combination thereof. The quadratic term implies a period
decrease at a rate of \dot{P}_orb = -7..-11 * 10^(-12) sec/sec. In case the
observed period change reflects a true angular momentum loss, this would be a
factor of 30 larger than given by gravitational radiation.

indium nitride by reaction with these indium clusters. We used the In 4d and P

allows us to assert that almost two monolayers of indium nitride are produced.

  Decision of Polynomial Inequalities",,,,,"math.NA math.AG math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In order to verify programs or hybrid systems, one often needs to prove that
certain formulas are unsatisfiable. In this paper, we consider conjunctions of
polynomial inequalities over the reals. Classical algorithms for deciding these
not only have high complexity, but also provide no simple proof of
unsatisfiability. Recently, a reduction of this problem to semidefinite
programming and numerical resolution has been proposed. In this article, we
show how this reduction generally produces degenerate problems on which
numerical methods stumble.

heavy-ion collisions within a two-dimensional transport model. We compute the
transverse radii R_o and R_s as a function of p_t for various values of the
Knudsen number, which measures the degree of thermalization in the system. They
converge to the hydrodynamical limit much more slowly (by a factor 3) than
elliptic flow. This solves most of the HBT puzzle for central collisions:
R_o/R_s is in the range 1.1-1.2 for realistic values of the Knudsen number,
much closer to experimental data ($\simeq 1$) than the value 1.5 from
hydrodynamical calculations. The p_t dependence of R_o and R_s, which is
usually said to reflect collective flow, also has a very limited sensitivity to
the degree of thermalization. We then study the azimuthal oscillations of R_o,
R_s, and R_{os} for non central collisions. Their amplitudes depend little on
the Knudsen number, and reflect the eccentricity of the overlap area between
the two nuclei.

resistivity and ac calorimetry up to 4 GPa and down to 40 mK. The two magnetic
transitions found in both resistivity and specific heat at 0.1 GPa at T_N1=3.95
and T_{N2}=3.21 K are replaced by a single one at 0.7 GPa and 2.81 K.
Increasing pressure initially reduces this further, however at about 1.7 GPa a
new transition appears, accompanied by a marked change in the pressure
dependence of the ordering temperatures, the temperature dependence of the
resistivity, and the residual resistivity. There are signs that this new
transition has some first order character. The phase diagram of CeNiGe2 bears
little resemblance to the Doniach phase diagram widely used to classify heavy
fermion compounds.

Second Law as F = -ma; they were using this form to ensure that the sign of the
force pointed in a direction consistent with the chosen coordinate system while
assuming that some variables have only positive value. We use one student's
detailed explanation to suggest that students' issues with variables are
context-dependent, and that much of their reasoning is useful for productive
instruction.

They accumulate electrons more efficiently than ions which leads to the
formation of a quasi-stationary electron film at the boundaries. We propose, in
a colloquial manner, a physisorption-inspired quantum-kinetic description of
the build-up of surface charges at inert plasma boundaries and calculate the
electron sticking coefficient and the electron desorption time, which play an
important role in determining the quasi-stationary surface charge, and about
which little is empirically and theoretically known, from a microscopic model
for the electron-wall interaction. In an exploratory calculation we
specifically consider a metallic boundary. But thereby we identify quite
generally what we believe are the key issues of the electronic microphysics at
inert plasma boundaries in the hope to inspire other groups to join us on our
journey.

repulsive screened Coulomb interactions between the particles are taken into
account assuming that the net charges are smeared out homogeneously over the
spherical protein surfaces. We incorporate attractive surface patches, with the
interactions between patches on different spheres modeled by an attractive
Yukawa potential. The parameters entering the attractive Yukawa potential part
are determined using information on the experimentally accessed gas-liquid-like
critical point. The Helmholtz free energy of the fluid and solid phases is
calculated using second-order thermodynamic perturbation theory. Our
predictions for the solubility curve are in fair agreement with experimental
data. In addition, we present new experimental data for the gas-liquid
coexistence curves at various salt concentrations and compare these with our
model calculations. In agreement with earlier findings, we observe that the
strength and the range of the attractive potential part only weakly depend on
the salt content.
