Lagrangian SPH technique, or Eulerian hydrodynamics on a Cartesian mesh with
adaptive mesh refinement. Both of these methods have disadvantages that
negatively impact their accuracy in certain situations. We here propose a novel
scheme which largely eliminates these weaknesses. It is based on a moving
unstructured mesh defined by the Voronoi tessellation of a set of discrete
points. The mesh is used to solve the hyperbolic conservation laws of ideal
hydrodynamics with a finite volume approach, based on a second-order unsplit
Godunov scheme with an exact Riemann solver. The mesh-generating points can in
principle be moved arbitrarily. If they are chosen to be stationary, the scheme
is equivalent to an ordinary Eulerian method with second order accuracy. If
they instead move with the velocity of the local flow, one obtains a Lagrangian
formulation of hydrodynamics that does not suffer from the mesh distortion
limitations inherent in other mesh-based Lagrangian schemes. In this mode, our
new method is fully Galilean-invariant, unlike ordinary Eulerian codes, a
property that is of significant importance for cosmological simulations. In
addition, the new scheme can adjust its spatial resolution automatically and
continuously, and hence inherits the principal advantage of SPH for simulations
of cosmological structure growth. The high accuracy of Eulerian methods in the
treatment of shocks is retained, while the treatment of contact discontinuities
improves. We discuss how this approach is implemented in our new parallel code
AREPO, both in 2D and 3D. We use a suite of test problems to examine the
performance of the new code and argue that it provides an attractive and
competitive alternative to current SPH and Eulerian techniques. (abridged)

which their electrons are strongly correlated. Here we address this issue
through the phenomenology of the charge transport and dynamics, single-electron
excitation spectrum, and magnetic ordering and dynamics. We outline the
evidence that the parent compounds, while metallic, have electron interactions
that are sufficiently strong to produce incipient Mott physics. In other words,
in terms of the strength of electron correlations compared to the kinetic
energy, the iron pnictides are closer to intermediately-coupled systems lying
at the boundary between itinerancy and localization, such as V2O3 or Se-doped
NiS2, rather than to simple antiferromagnetic metals like Cr. This level of
electronic correlations produces a new small parameter for controlled
theoretical analyses, namely the fraction of the single-electron spectral
weight that lies in the coherent part of the excitation spectrum. Using this
expansion parameter, we construct the effective low-energy Hamiltonian and
discuss its implications for the magnetic order and magnetic quantum
criticality. Finally, this approach sharpens the notion of magnetic frustration
for such a metallic system, and brings about a multiband matrix t-J1-J2 model
for the carrier-doped iron pnictides.

$B - L$ asymmetry generated at high temperatures is transfered to the dark
matter, which is charged under $B - L$. The interactions that transfer the
asymmetry decouple at temperatures above the dark matter mass, freezing in a
dark matter asymmetry of order the baryon asymmetry. This explains the observed
relation between the baryon and dark matter densities for dark matter mass in
the range 5--15 GeV. The symmetric component of the dark matter can annihilate
efficiently to light pseudoscalar Higgs particles $a$, or via $t$-channel
exchange of new scalar doublets. The first possibility allows for $h^0 \to aa$
decays, while the second predicts a light charged Higgs-like scalar decaying to

question of whether turbulence is isotropic and consistent with the Kolmogorov
theory at small length scales. Using numerical data from a high-resolution
simulation of a thermonuclear supernova explosion, spectra of the turbulence
energy and velocity structure functions are computed. We show that the
turbulent velocity field is isotropic at small length scales and follows a
scaling law that is consistent with the Kolmogorov theory until most of the
nuclear fuel is burned. At length scales greater than a certain characteristic
scale, turbulence becomes anisotropic. Here, the radial velocity fluctuations
follow the scaling law of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, whereas the angular
component still obeys Kolmogorov scaling. In the late phase of the explosion,
this characteristic scale drops below the numerical resolution of the
simulation. The analysis confirms that a subgrid-scale model for the unresolved
turbulence energy is required for the consistent calculation of the flame speed
in deflagration models of Type Ia supernovae, and that the assumption of
isotropy on these scales is appropriate.

the first one, in the supercooled phase in the range 269 K - 272 K, and a
second one above 273 K. In both these regions the measured proton kinetic
energy exceedes the theoretical prediction based on a semi-classical model.
Noteworthy, the proton mean kinetic energy has a maximum at 277 K, the
temperature of the maximum density of water. In the supercooled metastable
phase the measured mean kinetic energy and the proton momentum distribution
clearly indicate proton delocalization between two H-bonded oxygens.

Freeman","Informative Sensing","26 pages; submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Compressed sensing is a recent set of mathematical results showing that
sparse signals can be exactly reconstructed from a small number of linear
measurements. Interestingly, for ideal sparse signals with no measurement
noise, random measurements allow perfect reconstruction while measurements
based on principal component analysis (PCA) or independent component analysis
(ICA) do not. At the same time, for other signal and noise distributions, PCA
and ICA can significantly outperform random projections in terms of enabling
reconstruction from a small number of measurements. In this paper we ask: given
the distribution of signals we wish to measure, what are the optimal set of
linear projections for compressed sensing? We consider the problem of finding a
small number of linear projections that are maximally informative about the
signal. Formally, we use the InfoMax criterion and seek to maximize the mutual
information between the signal, x, and the (possibly noisy) projection y=Wx. We
show that in general the optimal projections are not the principal components
of the data nor random projections, but rather a seemingly novel set of
projections that capture what is still uncertain about the signal, given the
knowledge of distribution. We present analytic solutions for certain special
cases including natural images. In particular, for natural images, the
near-optimal projections are bandwise random, i.e., incoherent to the sparse
bases at a particular frequency band but with more weights on the
low-frequencies, which has a physical relation to the multi-resolution
representation of images.

volume (e.g., 40x300x1.2 micron3) and power dissipation that result in
selfheating and backbending of the current-voltage curve (I-V), there are
accessible bias conditions for which significant polarized THz-wave emission
can be observed. We estimate the mesa temperature by equating the quasiparticle
resistance, Rqp(T), to the ratio V/I over the entire I-V including the
backbending region. These temperatures are used to predict the unpolarized
black-body radiation reaching our bolometer and there is substantial agreement
over the entire I-V. As such, backbending results from the particular Rqp(T)
for Bi2212, as first discussed by Fenton, rather than a significant suppression
of the energy gap. This model also correctly predicts the observed
disappearance of backbending above ~60 K.

a few 10^{39} erg/s in the high/supersoft state: this is an order of magnitude
lower than estimated in previous studies, thus reducing the need for extreme or
exotic scenarios. Moreover, we find that this source was in a non-canonical
low/soft (kT ~ 0.1-0.3 keV) state during the Chandra observation. By comparing
the high and low state, we argue that the spectral properties may not be
consistent with the expected behaviour of an accreting intermediate-mass black
hole. We suggest that recurrent super-Eddington outbursts with photospheric
expansion from a massive white dwarf (M_{wd} >~ 1.3 M_{sun}), powered by
non-steady nuclear burning, may be a viable possibility, in alternative to the
previously proposed scenario of a super-Eddington outflow from an accreting
stellar-mass black hole. The long-term average accretion rate required for
nuclear burning to power such white-dwarf outbursts in this source and perhaps
in other supersoft ULXs is ~ 5-10 x 10^{-6} M_{sun}/yr: this is comparable to
the thermal-timescale mass transfer rate invoked to explain the most luminous
hard-spectrum ULXs (powered by black hole accretion). The other four most
luminous X-ray sources in NGC 4631 (three of which can be classified as ULXs)
appear to be typical accreting black holes, in four different spectral states:
high/soft, convex-spectrum, power-law with soft excess, and simple power-law.

equation $x^m-y^n=1$ has no solution for x,y,m,n in +ve integers other than the
trivial solution $ 3^2-2^3=1 $. An important and first ingredient for the proof
is Cassles criteria which says that whenever we have a solution of $x^p-y^q=1$
with p,q primes then $q|x$ and $p|y$ . Here we look a generalization of the
problem, namely we will consider the equation $x^p-y^q=1$ where x,y takes value
in ring of integers ${O}_K$ of a number field K and p,q are rational primes. In
this article we supply a possible formulation of Cassles criterion and a proof
for that in some particular cases of number fields. After this work one can

constrained by the requirement that nearly all of the initial angular momentum
of the diffuse material from which they form must be removed or redistributed
during the formation process. The mechanisms that may be involved and their
implications are discussed for (1) low-mass stars, most of which probably form
in binary or multiple systems; (2) massive stars, which typically form in
clusters; and (3) supermassive black holes that form in galactic nuclei. It is
suggested that in all cases, gravitational interactions with other stars or
mass concentrations in a forming system play an important role in
redistributing angular momentum and thereby enabling the formation of a compact
object. If this is true, the formation of stars and black holes must be a more
complex, dynamic, and chaotic process than in standard models. The
gravitational interactions that redistribute angular momentum tend to couple
the mass of a forming object to the mass of the system, and this may have
important implications for mass ratios in binaries, the upper stellar IMF in
clusters, and the masses of supermassive black holes in galaxies.

more robustly explained by exciting dark matter (DM) at the center of the
galaxy, if there is a peculiar spectrum of DM states chi_0, chi_1 and chi_2,
with masses M_0 ~ 500 GeV, M_1 <~ M_0 + 2 m_e, and M_2 = M_1 + delta M >~ M_0 +
2 m_e. The small mass splitting delta M should be <~ 100 keV. In addition, we
require at least two new gauge bosons (preferably three), with masses ~100 MeV.
With this spectrum, chi_1 is stable, but can be excited to chi_2 by
low-velocity DM scatterings near the galactic center, which are
Sommerfeld-enhanced by two of the 100 MeV gauge boson exchanges. The excited
state chi_2 decays to chi_0 and nonrelativistic e+e-, mediated by the third
gauge boson, which mixes with the photon and Z. Although such a small 100 keV
splitting has been independently proposed for explaining the DAMA annual
modulation through the inelastic DM mechanism, the need for stability of chi_1
(and hence seqestering it from the Standard Model) implies that our scenario
cannot account for the DAMA signal. It can however address the PAMELA/ATIC
positron excess via DM annihilation in the galaxy, and it offers the
possibility of a sharper feature in the ATIC spectrum relative to previously
proposed models. The data are consistent with three new gauge bosons, whose
couplings fit naturally into a broken SU(2) gauge theory where the DM is a
triplet of the SU(2). We propose a simple model in which the SU(2) is broken by
new Higgs triplet and 5-plet VEV's, giving rise to the right spectrum of DM,
and mixing of one of the new gauge bosons with the photon and Z boson. A
coupling of the DM to a heavy Z' may also be necessary to get the right relic
density and PAMELA/ATIC signals.

other stars with the same luminosity in their environment. As such they appear
to be much younger than the rest of the stellar population. Two main channels
have been suggested to produce such stars: (1) collisions between stars in
clusters or (2) mass transfer between, or merger of, the components of
primordial short-period binaries. Here we suggest a third scenario, in which
the progenitor of BSSs are formed in primordial (or dynamically formed)
hierarchical triple stars. In such configurations the dynamical evolution of
the triples through the Kozai mechanism and tidal friction can induce the
formation of very close inner binaries. Angular momentum loss in a magnetized
wind or stellar evolution could then lead to the merger of these binaries (or
to mass transfer between them) and produce BSSs in binary (or triple) systems.
We study this mechanism and its implications and show that it could naturally
explain many of the characteristics of the BSS population in clusters, most
notably the large binary fraction of long period BSS binaries; their unique
period-eccentricity distribution (with typical periods > 700 days); and the
typical location of these BSSs in the color-magnitude diagram, far from the
cluster turn-off point of their host clusters. We suggest that this scenario
has a major (possibly dominant) role in the formation of BSSs in open clusters
and give specific predictions for the the BSSs population formed in this
manner. We also note that triple systems may be the progenitors of the
brightest planetary nebulae in old elliptical galaxies, which possibly evolved
from BSSs.

Investigation of the difference between these two regimes have shown that
outflows appear only in the case where the ""friction"" between the disk and

small. Matter outflows in a wide cone and is magneto-centrifugally ejected from
the inner regions of the disk. Closer to the axis there is a strong,
collimated, magnetically dominated outflow of energy and angular momentum
carried by the open magnetic field lines from the star. The ""efficiency"" of the
propeller may be very high in the respect that most of the incoming disk matter
is expelled from the system in winds. The star spins-down rapidly due to the
magnetic interaction with the disk through closed field lines and with corona
through open field lines. This mechanism may act in a variety of situations
where magnetized star rotates with super-Keplerian velocity at the
magnetospheric boundary. We speculate that in general any object rotating with

observed by the Cosmic Background Imager (CBI); most are extragalactic active
galactic nuclei (AGN) with 1.4 GHz flux densities of 3 to 10 mJy. The resulting

analysis to obtain an unbiased estimate of the distribution of the 1.4 to 31

~ nu^alpha); 9.0 +/- 0.8 % of sources have alpha > -0.5 and 1.2 +/- 0.2 % have
alpha > 0. By combining this spectral index distribution with 1.4 GHz source
counts we predict 31 GHz source counts in the range 1 mJy < S_31 < 4 mJy,
N(>S_31) = (16.7 +/- 1.7) deg^2 (S_31/1 mJy)^(-0.80 +/- 0.07). We also assess

Including an estimated contribution of 12 micro-Kelvin^2 from the population of
sources responsible for the turn-up in counts below S_1.4 = 1 mJy this amounts
to 21 +/- 7 % of what is needed to explain the CBI high-ell excess signal, 275
+/- 63 micro-Kelvin^2. These results are consistent with other measurements of

large disk galaxies but becomes significant for SMC-type galaxies and less

and that gas-rich mergers are increasingly common at high redshift. Though the
frequency of major mergers into galaxy halos in our simulations greatly exceeds
the observed late-type galaxy fraction, the frequency of gas-poor major mergers
is consistent with the observed fraction of spheroid-dominated galaxies across
the halo mass range M_DM ~ 10^11-10^13 Msun. These results lend support to the
conjecture that mergers with high baryonic gas fractions play an important role
in building and/or preserving disk galaxies in the universe. Also, we find that
the overall fraction of a galaxy's cold baryons deposited directly via major
mergers is substantial. Approximately ~30% of the cold baryonic material in
M_star ~ 10^10 Msun$ (M_DM ~ 10^11.5 Msun) galaxies is accreted as cold gas in
major mergers. For more massive galaxies with M_star ~ 10^11 Msun (M_DM ~ 10^13
Msun) the fraction of baryons amassed in mergers is even higher, ~50%, but most
of these accreted baryons are delivered directly in the form of stars. This
baryonic mass deposition is almost unavoidable, and provides a limit on the
fraction of a galaxy's cold baryons that can originate in cold flows or from
hot halo cooling. (Abridged)

high-redshift galaxies by modeling broad-band SEDs with stellar population
synthesis. In order to do so, we computed synthetic optical-to-NIR SEDs for
model galaxies taken from hydrodynamical merger simulations placed at redshifts
1.5 < z < 3. Viewed under different angles and during different evolutionary
phases, the simulations represent a wide variety of galaxy types (disks,
mergers, spheroids). We show that simulated galaxies span a wide range in SEDs
and color, comparable to these of observed galaxies. In all star-forming
phases, dust attenuation has a large effect on colors, SEDs, and fluxes. The
broad-band SEDs were then fed to a standard SED modeling procedure and
resulting stellar population parameters were compared to their true values.
Disk galaxies generally show a decent median correspondence between the true
and estimated mass and age, but suffer from large uncertainties. During the
merger itself, we find larger offsets (e.g., log M_recovered - log M_true =
-0.13^{+0.10}_{-0.14}). E(B-V) values are generally recovered well, but the
estimated total visual absorption Av is consistently too low, increasingly so
for larger optical depths. Since the largest optical depths occur during the
phases of most intense star formation, it is for the highest SFRs that we find
the largest underestimates. The masses, ages, E(B-V), Av, and SFR of merger
remnants (spheroids) are very well reproduced. We discuss possible biases in
SED modeling results caused by mismatch between the true and template star
formation history, dust distribution, metallicity variations and AGN
contribution.

star-formation rate, while SNe Ia in nearby red galaxies show no significant

samples of SNe in red hosts are relatively small in number, tests on simulated

SN Ia hosts is in poor agreement with a cluster type Ia rate strongly elevated

gas-phase metallicity effect, such that prompt type Ia supernovae occur more
often or are more luminous in metal-poor systems.

(LF) and galaxy scaling relations down to the regime of galaxies with M_V~-10
mag. On deep VLT/FORS1 V- and I-band images of the central part of the cluster,
we identify cluster dwarf-galaxy candidates using both morphological and
surface brightness selection criteria. Photometric and structural parameters of
the candidates are derived from analysis of their surface brightness profiles.
Fundamental scaling relations, such as the colour-magnitude and the
magnitude-surface brightness relation, are used to distinguish the cluster from
the background. We find a flat LF with a slope of \alpha = -1.14 \pm 0.12 for
M_V>-14 mag, when fitting a power law to the completeness-corrected galaxy
number counts. When plotting the central surface brightness of a Sersic model
vs. the galaxy magnitude, we find a continuous relation for magnitudes
-20<M_V<-10 mag, with only the brightest core galaxies deviating from this
relation, in agreement with previous studies of other clusters. In a
size-luminosity diagram of early-type galaxies from a range of environments, we
observe that R_eff slowly decreases with decreasing luminosity for -21<M_V<-13
mag and decreases more rapidly at fainter magnitudes. This trend continues to
the ultra-faint Local Group dwarf galaxies (M_V~-4 mag). The continuous central
surface brightness vs. absolute magnitude relation and the smooth relation in
the size-luminosity diagram over a wide range of magnitudes are consistent with
the interpretation of dwarf galaxies and more massive elliptical galaxies being
one family of objects with gradually changing structural properties. The most
massive core galaxies and the rare cE galaxies are the only exceptions.

fields and thus massless. The second and third fermion families have a very
symmetric coupling to the Higgs fields. But through the electroweak symmetry
breaking a large mass hierarchy is generated between these fermion families.
Thus, the fermion mass spectrum of the model presents a rough approximation to
what is observed in Nature. In the MCPM there are, as in every
two-Higgs-doublet model, five physical Higgs bosons, three neutral ones and a
charged pair. In the MCPM the couplings of the Higgs bosons to the fermions are
completely fixed. This allows us to present clear predictions for the

collapse and the revival of the Rabi oscillations in the Jaynes-Cummings model
(JCM). The JCM is an exactly soluble quantum mechanical model, which describes
the interaction between a two-level atom and a single cavity mode of the
electromagnetic field. If we prepare the atom in the ground state and the
cavity mode in a coherent state initially, the JCM causes the collapse and the
revival of the Rabi oscillations many times in a complicated pattern in its
time-evolution. In this phenomenon, the atomic population inversion is
described with an intractable infinite series. (When the electromagnetic field
is resonant with the atom, the $n$th term of this infinite series is given by a
trigonometric function for $\sqrt{n}t$, where $t$ is a variable of the time.)
According to Klimov and Chumakov's method, using the Abel-Plana formula, we
rewrite this infinite series as a sum of two integrals. We examine the physical
meanings of these two integrals and find that the first one represents the
initial collapse (the semi-classical limit) and the second one represents the
revival (the quantum correction) in the JCM. Furthermore, we evaluate the first

initial thermal coherent state for the cavity mode at low temperature, and
write down their correction terms as sums of integrals by making use of the
Abel-Plana formula.

algebraic group over $k$ and let $\mathfrak{g}$ be its Lie algebra. Let $k(G)$,
respectively, $k(\mathfrak{g})$, be the field of $k$-rational functions on $G$,
respectively, $\mathfrak{g}$. The conjugation action of $G$ on itself induces
the adjoint action of $G$ on $\mathfrak{g}$. We investigate the question
whether or not the field extensions $k(G)/k(G)^G$ and
$k(\mathfrak{g})/k(\mathfrak{g})^G$ are purely transcendental. We show that the
answer is the same for $k(G)/k(G)^G$ and $k(\mathfrak{g})/k(\mathfrak{g})^G$,
and reduce the problem to the case where $G$ is simple. For simple groups we
show that the answer is positive if $G$ is split of type ${\sf A}_{n}$ or ${\sf
C}_n$, and negative for groups of other types, except possibly ${\sf G}_{2}$. A
key ingredient in the proof of the negative result is a recent formula for the
unramified Brauer group of a homogeneous space with connected stabilizers.
  As a byproduct of our investigation we give an affirmative answer to a
question of Grothendieck about the existence of a rational section of the
categorical quotient morphism for the conjugating action of $G$ on itself. The
results and methods of this paper have played an important part in recent A.

genes have a distribution of `expression biases,' and we consider
non-synchronous update, as well as extension of our method to non-Boolean

stability is governed by the maximum eigenvalue of a modified adjacency matrix,

are properly accounted for, the rest-frame UV spectra of the higher-redshift

and z~5 show Lya both in emission and in absorption; when in absorption, strong
interstellar lines and red UV spectra are observed, a fact also measured at z~2
and 3. At z~6, sensitivity issues bias our sample towards galaxies with Lya in
emission; nevertheless, these spectra appear to be similar to their
lower-redshift counterparts. As in other studies at similar redshifts, we find
clear evidence that brighter LBGs tend to have weaker Lya emission lines. At
fixed rest-frame UV luminosity, the equivalent width of the Lya emission line
is larger at higher redshifts. At all redshifts where the measurements can be
reliably made, the redshift of the Lya emission line turns out to be larger
than that of the interstellar absorption lines,with a median velocity
difference DeltaV~400 km/s at z~4 and 5, consistent with results at lower
redshifts. This shows that powerful, large-scale winds are common at high

alignment, for the K-user interference channel with time-varying fading. At any
particular time, each receiver will see a superposition of the transmitted
signals plus noise. The standard approach to such a scenario results in each
transmitter-receiver pair achieving a rate proportional to 1/K its
interference-free ergodic capacity. However, given two well-chosen time
indices, the channel coefficients from interfering users can be made to exactly
cancel. By adding up these two observations, each receiver can obtain its
desired signal without any interference. If the channel gains have independent,
uniform phases, this technique allows each user to achieve at least 1/2 its
interference-free ergodic capacity at any signal-to-noise ratio. Prior
interference alignment techniques were only able to attain this performance as
the signal-to-noise ratio tended to infinity. Extensions are given for the case
where each receiver wants a message from more than one transmitter as well as
the ""X channel"" case (with two receivers) where each transmitter has an
independent message for each receiver. Finally, it is shown how to generalize
this strategy beyond Gaussian channel models. For a class of finite field
interference channels, this approach yields the ergodic capacity region.

thickness tends to infinity and, consequently, the Hausdorff dimension of the
spectrum tends to one. Moreover, the length of every gap tends to zero
linearly. Finally, for sufficiently small coupling, the sum of the spectrum
with itself is an interval. This last result provides a rigorous explanation of
a phenomenon for the Fibonacci square lattice discovered numerically by
Even-Dar Mandel and Lifshitz.

polyanaliticity of the space. Such conditions are equivalent to sharp lattice
density conditions for certain vector-valued Gabor systems, namely superframes

superframes they were studied recently by Gr\""{o}chenig and Lyubarskii. The
proofs of our main results use variations of the Janssen-Ron-Shen duality
principle and reveal a duality between sampling and interpolation in
polyanalytic spaces, and multiple interpolation and sampling in analytic
spaces. To connect these topics we introduce the\emph{polyanalytic Bargmann
transform}, a unitary mapping between vector valued Hilbert spaces and
polyanalytic Fock spaces, which extends the Bargmann transform to polyanalytic
spaces. Motivated by this connection, we discuss a vector-valued version of the
Gabor transform. These ideas have natural applications in the context of
multiplexing of signals. We also point out that a recent result of Balan,
Casazza and Landau, concerning density of Gabor frames, has important
consequences for the Gr\""{o}chenig-Lyubarskii conjecture on the density of

velocity distribution of dilute plasmas, in which the effect of collisions
between particles is negligible, and has the advantage that the accuracy of the
calculated velocity distribution does not depend on the density of plasmas at
each point in the physical space. We succeed in reproducing some features of
the Weibel instability shown by other simulations, for example, the
exponentially growing phase, the saturation of the magnetic field strength, the
formation of filamentary structure, and the coalescence of the filaments.
Especially, we concentrate on the behavior of the filaments after the
saturation of the magnetic field strength and find that there is a kind of
quasi-equilibrium states before the coalescence occurs. Furthermore, it is
found that an analytical solution for stationary states of the 2D3V
Vlasov-Maxwell system can reproduce some dominant features of the
quasi-equilibrium, e.g, the configuration of the magnetic field and the
velocity distribution at each point. The analytical expression could give a
plausible model for the transition layer of a collisionless shock where a
strong magnetic field generated by the Weibel instability provides an effective

in the formation of planetary nebulae (PNe). Yet there remains a severe paucity
of known binary central stars required to test the binary hypothesis and to
place strong constraints on the physics of the common-envelope (CE) phase of
binary stellar evolution. Large photometric surveys offer an unrivalled
opportunity to efficiently discover many binary central stars. We have combined
photometry from the OGLE microlensing survey with the largest sample of PNe
towards the Galactic Bulge to systematically search for new binaries. A total
of 21 periodic binaries were found thereby more than doubling the known sample.
The orbital period distribution was found to be best described by CE population
synthesis models when no correlation between primary and secondary masses is
assumed for the initial mass ratio distribution. A comparison with post-CE
white dwarf binaries indicates both distributions are representative of the
true post-CE period distribution with most binaries exhibiting periods less
than one day. An estimated close binary fraction of 12--21% is derived and is
the first robust and independent validation of the prevailing 10--15% fraction
estimated by Bond (2000). This suggests that binarity is not a precondition for
the formation of PNe and that close binaries do not play a dominant role in the
shaping of nebular morphologies. Systematic effects and biases of the survey
are discussed with implications for future photometric surveys.

precocongruences are a better approximation of behavioural equivalence than
2^2-bisimulations. We also introduce a notion of modal saturation for
neighbourhood models, and investigate its relationship with definability and
image-finiteness. We prove a Hennessy-Milner theorem for modally saturated and
for image-finite neighbourhood models. Our main results are an analogue of Van
Benthem's characterisation theorem and a model-theoretic proof of Craig

radius where the internal binding force of the compact subgroup balances the
external tidal force of the whole system. This effect would torn apart member
galaxies situated in this region determining a marked isolation of the
subgroups from the rest of the host groups. If so, subsequent evolution of
these subgroups should not be affected by external influences as the infall of
new surrounding galaxies on them. Following this idea we have developed a
statistical method of investigation and performed an application to show
evidences of such effect studying a loose group of galaxies hosting a compact
group in its central region. The system UZC 578 / HCG 68 seems to be a fair
example of such hypothesized process.

oriented hyperspheres in the standard sphere. They can be equivalently
described as parabolic geometries corresponding to the contact grading of
orthogonal real Lie algebra. It follows the underlying geometric structure can
be interpreted in several equivalent ways. In particular, we show this is given
by a split-quaternionic structure on the contact distribution, which is
compatible with the Levi bracket. In this vein, we study the geometry of
chains, a distinguished family of curves appearing in any parabolic contact
geometry. Also to the system of chains there is associated a canonical
parabolic geometry of specific type. Up to some exceptions in low dimensions,
it turns out this can be obtained by an extension of the parabolic geometry
associated to the Lie contact structure if and only if the latter is locally
flat. In that case we can show that chains are never geodesics of an affine
connection, hence, in particular, the path geometry of chains is always
non-trivial. Using appropriately this fact, we conclude that the path geometry
of chains allows to recover the Lie contact structure, hence, in particular,
transformations preserving chains must preserve the Lie contact structure.

particles in protoplanetary discs in which angular momentum transport is due to
MHD turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability. We consider
particle sizes that range from approximately 1 micron up to a few
millimeters.We use a grid--based MHD code to perform global two-fluid
simulations of turbulent protoplanetary discs which contain dust grains of
various sizes. In quasi--steady state, the gravitational settling of dust
particles is balanced by turbulent diffusion. Simple and standard models of
this process fail to describe accurately the vertical profile of the dust
density. The disagreement is larger for small dust particles (of a few microns
in size), especially in the disc upper layers ($Z>3H$, where $H$ is the
scale-height). Here there can be orders of magnitude in the disagreement
between the simple model predictions and the simulation results. This is
because MHD turbulence is not homogeneous in accretion discs, since velocity
fluctuations increase significantly in the disc upper layer where a strongly
magnetized corona develops. We provide an alternative model that gives a better
fit to the simulations. In this model, dust particles are diffused away from
the midplane by MHD turbulence, but the diffusion coefficient varies vertically
and is everywhere proportional to the square of the local turbulent vertical
velocity fluctuations. The spatial distribution of dust particles can be used
to trace the properties of MHD turbulence in protoplanetary discs, such as the
amplitude of the velocity fluctuations. In the future, detailed and direct
comparison between numerical simulations and observations should prove a useful
tool for constraining the properties of turbulence in protoplanetary discs.

we observe for the 3d Anderson model obeys a power law as predicted by Larkin

the prediction. However, the power law holds only for much smaller magnetic
fields than has been previously assumed, and is accompanied by a large
prefactor, leading to a surprising strong dependence of the transition point on
the applied magnetic field. Furthermore, we show that the critical
level-spacing distribution is identical in the presence and absence of a
magnetic field if hard-wall boundary conditions are applied. This result is
surprising since both cases belong to different universality classes and
different distributions have been reported for periodic boundary conditions.

many areas of physics, chemistry, and biology. The uncontrollable interaction
of the transmission network with a noisy environment is usually assumed to
deteriorate its transport capacity, especially so when the system is
fundamentally quantum mechanical. Here we identify key mechanisms through which
noise such as dephasing, perhaps counter intuitively, may actually aid
transport through a dissipative network by opening up additional pathways for
excitation transfer. We show that these are processes that lead to the
inhibition of destructive interference and exploitation of line broadening
effects. We illustrate how these mechanisms operate on a fully connected
network by developing a powerful analytical technique that identifies the
invariant (excitation trapping) subspaces of a given Hamiltonian. Finally, we
show how these principles can explain the remarkable efficiency and robustness
of excitation energy transfer from the light-harvesting chlorosomes to the
bacterial reaction center in photosynthetic complexes and present a numerical
analysis of excitation transport across the Fenna-Matthew-Olson (FMO) complex
together with a brief analysis of its entanglement properties. Our results show
that, in general, it is the careful interplay of quantum mechanical features
and the unavoidable environmental noise that will lead to an optimal system
performance.

possibilities like separability criterion (Peres-Horodecki criterion [14,15]),
non violation of Bell's inequality [6]($M(\rho)<1$)and teleportation fidelity
[1,2,3,4] ($(F_{max}>{2/3})$) for this state. We also obtain a relationship
between $N$ (number of qubits) and $p$ (the classical probability of random
mixture) for each of these possibilities. Finally we present a detailed
analysis of all these possibilities for $N=3,4,5$ qubit systems. We also report
that for N=3 and $p\in(.75,1]$, this entangled state can be used as a
teleportation channel without violating Bell's inequality.

was tentatively explained by the presence of a second population with either an
age difference of about 1 Gyr, or a higher C+N+O abundance, probably due to
pollution by the first generation of stars.
  In the present Letter, we analyze VLT-FORS V,I images, covering 12.7x12.7
arcmin, in the southwest quadrant of the cluster, allowing us to probe the
extent of the double SGB from ~1.4 to ~13 arcmin from the cluster center. Our
study reveals, for the first time, that the ""peculiar"" population is the one
associated to the fainter SGB. Indeed, while the percentage of stars in this
sequence is about 45% in the cluster core (as previously found on the basis of
HST-ACS data), we find that it drops sharply, to a level consistent with zero
in our data, at ~2.4 arcmin from the cluster center, where the brighter SGB, in
our sample, still contains ~100 stars. Implications for the proposed scenarios
are discussed.

low intensity beam (quantum regime) the bosonic annihilation operator does
indeed describe a single photon subtraction, while the creation operator
describes a photon addition. Nonetheless, the exact formal expressions for
these operations do not always reduce to these simple identifications, and in
this connection here we deduce the general superoperators for multiple photons
subtraction and addition processes and analyze the statistics of the resulting
states for classical field states having an arbitrary intensity. We obtain
closed analytical expressions and verify that for classical fields with high
intensity (classical regime) the operators that describe photon subtraction and
addition processes deviate significantly from simply annihilation and creation
operators. Complementarily, we analyze in details such a smooth
quantum-classical transition as function of beam intensity for both processes.

adimitting superposition laws, as recently stated in [5]. A Lie-Vessiot sys-
tem is automatically translated into a equation in a Lie group that we call
automorphic system. Reciprocally an automorphic system induces a hierarchy of
Lie-Vessiot systems. In this work we study the global analytic aspects of a
classical method of reduction of differential equations, due to S. Lie. We
propose an differential Galois theory for automorphic systems, and explore the
relationship between integrability in terms of Galois the- ory and the Lie's

Lie-Vessiot systems in algebraic homogeneous spaces. Lie-Vessiot systems are
non autonomous vector fields that are linear combinations with time-dependent
coefficients of fundamental vector fields of an algebraic Lie group action.
Those systems are the building blocks for differential equations that admit
superposition of solutions. Lie-Vessiot systems in algebraic homogeneous spaces
include the case of linear differential equations. Therefore, the differential
Galois theory for Lie-Vessiot systems is an extension of the classical
Picard-Vessiot theory. In particular, algebraic Lie-Vessiot systems are
solvable in terms of Kolchin's strongly normal extensions. Therefore, strongly
normal extensions are geometrically interpreted as the fields of functions on
principal homogeneous spaces over the Galois group. Finally we consider the
problem of integrability and solvability of automorphic differential equations.
Our main tool is a classical method of reduction, somewhere cited as Lie
reduction. We develop and algebraic version of this method, that we call
Lie-Kolchin reduction. Obstructions to the application are related to Galois
cohomology.

red abalone consists of layers of 400-nm thick aragonite crystalline tablets
confined by organic matrix sheets, with the $(001)$ crystal axes of the
aragonite tablets oriented to within $\pm$ 12 degrees from the normal to the
layer planes. Recent experiments demonstrate that this orientational order
develops over a distance of tens of layers from the prismatic boundary at which
nacre formation begins.
  Our previous simulations of a model in which the order develops because of
differential tablet growth rates (oriented tablets growing faster than
misoriented ones) yield patterns of tablets that agree qualitatively and
quantitatively with the experimental measurements. This paper presents an
analytical treatment of this model, focusing on how the dynamical development
and eventual degree of order depend on model parameters. Dynamical equations
for the probability distributions governing tablet orientations are introduced
whose form can be determined from symmetry considerations and for which
substantial analytic progress can be made. Numerical simulations are performed
to relate the parameters used in the analytic theory to those in the
microscopic growth model. The analytic theory demonstrates that the dynamical
mechanism is able to achieve a much higher degree of order than naive estimates
would indicate.

challenging in certain situations to deliver a high degree of longitudinal
polarization to all the halls simultaneously. Normally, the degree of
longitudinal polarization the halls receive is optimized by changing the
initial spin direction at the beginning of the machine with a Wien filter.
Herein, it is shown that it is possible to further improve the degree of

general, some of these solutions might be dynamically unstable, making them
inappropriate as descriptions of steady-state galaxies. Here we demonstrate for
the first time the existence in triaxial galaxy models of an instability
similar to the radial-orbit instability of spherical models. The instability
manifests itself when the number of box orbits, with predominantly radially
motions, is sufficiently large. N-body simulations verify that the evolution is
due neither to chaotic orbits nor to departures of the model from
self-consistency, but rather to a collective mode. The instability transforms
the triaxial model into a more prolate, but still triaxial, configuration.
Stable triaxial models are obtained when the mass contribution of radial orbits
is reduced. The implications of our results for the shapes of dark-matter halos
are discussed.
