Second, we prove that every Reeb flow has at least as many close Reeb orbits as

deposition tool called Biased Target Ion Beam Deposition (BTIBD) using low
energy ion source (0-50 eV) and voltage biased targets. The BTIBD system
applies bias voltage directly and only on the desired targets, providing enough
sputtering energy and avoiding ""overspill"" contamination during film
deposition. The successful deposition of AlOx-MTJs demonstrated the capability
of BTIBD to make multilayer structures with good film quality. MTJ thin film
surface roughness and intermixing between layers are among the key problems
leading to low TMR performance. Here by studying the bias voltage effect on MTJ
properties via the measurement of Neel coupling field and TMR, we suggest that
the lower bias voltage reduces the intermixing that occurs when top CoFe free
layer is deposited on AlOx barrier, but produces relatively high surface
roughness. On the other hand, higher energy deposition enhances both interlayer
mixing and surface flattening. Such understanding of bias voltage effects on
film properties could be used to optimize the MTJ performances.

Galileo to be data supporting the Copernican Principle.

a double-gaussian probability distribution, which consists of two single
gaussian distributions, centered at $+h_{o}$ and $-h_{o}$, with the same width
$\sigma$. This distribution is very general, and can recover in appropriate
limits the bimodal distribution ($\sigma\to 0$) and the single gaussian one

the range $L=32 - 512$. The system exhibits ferromagnetic and paramagnetic
steady states. Our results suggest the occurence of first-order phase
transitions between the above-mentioned phases at low temperatures and large
random-field intensities $h_{o}$, for some small values of the width $\sigma$.
By means of finite size scaling, we estimate the critical exponents in the
low-field region, where we have continuous phase transitions. In addition, we
show a sketch of the phase diagram of the model for some values of $\sigma$.

scattering phase shifts using chiral effective theory potentials. This allows
us to consider arbitrarily high cutoffs in the Lippmann-Schwinger equation
(LSE). We employ NN potentials computed up to next-to-next-to-leading order
(NNLO) in chiral effective theory, using both dimensional regularization and
spectral-function regularization. Our results obtained from the subtracted
P-wave LSE show that renormalization of the NNLO potential can be achieved by
using the generalized NN scattering lengths as input--an alternative to fitting
the constant that multiplies the P-wave contact interaction in the chiral
effective theory NN force. However, in order to obtain a reasonable fit to the
NN data at NNLO the generalized scattering lengths must be varied away from the
values extracted from the so-called high-precision potentials. We investigate
how the generalized scattering lengths extracted from NN data using various
chiral potentials vary with the cutoff in the LSE. The cutoff-dependence of
these observables, as well as of the phase shifts at $T_{lab} \approx 100$ MeV,
suggests that for a chiral potential computed with dimensional regularization
the highest LSE cutoff it is sensible to adopt is approximately 1 GeV. Using
spectral-function regularization to compute the two-pion-exchange potentials
postpones the onset of cutoff dependence in these quantities, but does not
remove it.

assemblies. It is anticipated that these constructs could be made of different
shapes, patterns and functionalities and could constitute the components of
future nanodevices including sensors, actuators or nanocircuits. Here we report
a protocol that allowed us to fabricate such nanoparticle aggregates. The
building blocks of the constructs were anionically coated iron oxide
nanocrytals (superparamagnetic, size 7 nm) and cationic-neutral block
copolymers. We have shown that the electrostatic interactions between charged
species can be controlled by tuning the ionic strength of the dispersion. Under
appropriate conditions, the control of electrostatics resulted in the
elaboration of spherical or elongated aggregates at the micrometer length
scale. The elongated aggregates were found to be rod-like, with diameters of a
few hundred nanometers and lengths between 1 and 50 micrometers. In addition to
their remarkable stiffness, the nanostructured rods were found to reorient
along with an externally applied magnetic field, in agreement with the laws of
superparamagnetism.

interest from both practical and theoretical viewpoints, as it holds the
promise of reducing an inequality-constrained problem to an
equality-constrained problem, in a neighborhood of a solution. We study this
issue in the more general setting of composite nonsmooth minimization, in which
the objective is a composition of a smooth vector function c with a lower
semicontinuous function h, typically nonsmooth but structured. In this setting,
the graph of the generalized gradient of h can often be decomposed into a union
(nondisjoint) of simpler subsets. ""Identification"" amounts to deciding which
subsets of the graph are ""active"" in the criticality conditions at a given
solution. We give conditions under which any convergent sequence of approximate
critical points finitely identifies the activity. Prominent among these
properties is a condition akin to the Mangasarian-Fromovitz constraint
qualification, which ensures boundedness of the set of multiplier vectors that
satisfy the optimality conditions at the solution.

dimming over their entire lifetime, thus making substellar models challenging
to test because of the strong dependence on age. Currently, most brown dwarfs
with independently determined ages are companions to nearby stars, so stellar
ages are at the heart of the effort to test substellar models. However, these
models are only fully constrained if both the mass and age are known. We have
used the Keck adaptive optics system to monitor the orbit of HD 130948BC, a
brown dwarf binary that is a companion to the young solar analog HD 130948A.
The total dynamical mass of 0.109+/-0.003 Msun shows that both components are
substellar, and the ensemble of available age indicators from the primary star
suggests an age comparable to the Hyades, with the most precise age being 0.79
Gyr based on gyrochronology. Therefore, HD 130948BC is unique among field L and
T dwarfs as it possesses a well-determined mass, luminosity, and age. Our
results indicate that substellar evolutionary models may underpredict the
luminosity of brown dwarfs by as much as a factor of ~2-3x. The implications of
such a systematic error in evolutionary models would be far-reaching, for
example, affecting determinations of the initial mass function and predictions
of the radii of extrasolar gas-giant planets. This result is largely based on
the reliability of stellar age estimates, and the case study of HD 130948A
highlights the difficulties in determining the age of an arbitrary field star,
even with the most up-to-date chromospheric activity and gyrochronology
relations. In order to better assess the potential systematic errors present in
substellar models, more refined age estimates for HD 130948A and other stars
with binary brown dwarf companions (e.g., eps Ind Bab) are critically needed.

However, there are some subtleties in the calculation of Hawking radiation, and
particularly is the so-called factor of 2 problem during calculating the
Hawking temperature. The most popular opinion on this problem is that it is
just a problem of the choice of coordinates. However, following other
treatments we show that we can also consider this problem as a problem that we
do not consider the contribution from P(absorption). Moreover, we also give
some subtleties in the balance method and some comparisons with other

that if one takes the tunneling particles' back-reaction into account, the
Hawking radiation would be modified, and this modification is underlying
consistent with the unitary theory, we further find that this modification is
also underlying correlated with the laws of black hole thermodynamics.
Furthermore, we show that this tunneling method may be valid just when the

peers correctly follow the protocol, but try to reveal private information. We
provide three possible schemes for secure multi-party numerical computation for
this model and identify a single light-weight scheme which outperforms the
others. Using extensive simulation results over real Internet topologies, we
demonstrate that our scheme is scalable to very large networks, with up to
millions of nodes. The second model we consider is the malicious peers model,
where peers can behave arbitrarily, deliberately trying to affect the results
of the computation as well as compromising the privacy of other peers. For this
model we provide a fourth scheme to defend the execution of the computation
against the malicious peers. The proposed scheme has a higher complexity
relative to the semi-honest model. Overall, we provide the Peer-to-Peer network
designer a set of tools to choose from, based on the desired level of security.

metrics (IPMs) -- is addressed: these include the Wasserstein distance, Dudley
metric, and Maximum Mean Discrepancy. IPMs have thus far mostly been used in
more abstract settings, for instance as theoretical tools in mass
transportation problems, and in metrizing the weak topology on the set of all
Borel probability measures defined on a metric space. Practical applications of
IPMs are less common, with some exceptions in the kernel machines literature.
The present work contributes a number of novel properties of IPMs, which should
contribute to making IPMs more widely used in practice, for instance in areas
where $\phi$-divergences are currently popular.
  First, to understand the relation between IPMs and $\phi$-divergences, the
necessary and sufficient conditions under which these classes intersect are
derived: the total variation distance is shown to be the only non-trivial
$\phi$-divergence that is also an IPM. This shows that IPMs are essentially
different from $\phi$-divergences. Second, empirical estimates of several IPMs
from finite i.i.d. samples are obtained, and their consistency and convergence
rates are analyzed. These estimators are shown to be easily computable, with
better rates of convergence than estimators of $\phi$-divergences. Third, a
novel interpretation is provided for IPMs by relating them to binary
classification, where it is shown that the IPM between class-conditional
distributions is the negative of the optimal risk associated with a binary
classifier. In addition, the smoothness of an appropriate binary classifier is
proved to be inversely related to the distance between the class-conditional
distributions, measured in terms of an IPM.

the geodesic distance squared. In order to generalise Loeper's calculation to a
broader class of cost-functions, the (A3) condition is reformulated via a
stereographic projection that maps charts of the sphere into Euclidean space.
This reformulation subsequently allows one to verify the (A3) condition for any
case where the cost-fuction of the associated optimal transportation problem
can be expressed as a function of the geodesic distance between points on a

analysed to see whether or not they satisfy this (A3) condition.

superfluid density is suppressed by external magnetic field, and is able to
generate a gap for initially gapless nodal quasiparticles beyond some critical
field $H_{c}$. By solving the gap equation, it is found that the nodal gap
increases with growing field $H$, which leads to a suppression of thermal
conductivity at zero temperature. This mechanism naturally produces the
field-induced thermal metal-insulator transition observed in transport
experiments.

hom-connection with respect to any differential graded algebra. The bulk of the
paper is devoted to describing a method of constructing hom-connections from

introduced and the induced first order differential calculus is described. It
is shown that any free twisted multi-derivation on an algebra A induces a
unique hom-connection on A that vanishes on the dual basis for the module of
one-forms. To any flat hom-connection \nabla on A one associates a chain
complex, termed a complex of integral forms on A. The canonical cokernel
morphism to the zeroth homology space is called a \nabla-integral. Examples of
free twisted multi-derivations, hom-connections and corresponding integral
forms are provided by covariant calculi on Hopf algebras or quantum groups and
on quantum spaces. The example of a flat hom-connection within the 3D
left-covariant differential calculus on the quantum group SL(2) is described in
full detail. A descent of hom-connections to the base algebra of a faithfully
flat Hopf-Galois extension or a principal comodule algebra is studied. As an
example, a hom-connection on the standard quantum Podles sphere is presented.
In both cases the complex of integral forms is shown to be isomorphic to the de
