average early-type galaxy color-magnitude relation (CMR) from z=1 to the
present day, finding that it is consistent with models in which galaxies are
constantly being added to the red sequence through truncation of star formation
in blue cloud galaxies. We used a sample of over 700 red sequence,
structurally-selected early-type galaxies (defined to have Sersic index >2.5)
with redshifts 0<z<1 taken from the Extended Chandra Deep Field South (173
galaxies) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (550 galaxies), constructing
rest-frame U-V colors accurate to <0.04mag. We find that the scatter of the CMR
of cosmic average early-type galaxies is ~0.1mag in rest-frame U-V color at
0.05<z<0.75, and somewhat higher at z=1. We compared these observations with a
model in which new red sequence galaxies are being constantly added at the rate
required to match the observed number density evolution, and found that this
model predicts the correct CMR scatter and its evolution. Furthermore, this
model predicts approximately the correct number density of `blue spheroids' -
structurally early-type galaxies with blue colors - albeit with considerable
model dependence. Thus, we conclude that both the evolution of the number
density and colors of the early-type galaxy population paint a consistent
picture in which the early-type galaxy population grows significantly between
z=1 and the present day through the quenching of star formation in blue cloud
galaxies.

profiles are well fitted by the universal form predicted in N-body simulations
of the LCDM model, all four clusters appear to be slightly more centrally
concentrated (the concentration parameters c_vir \sim 8) than theoretical
predictions, even after accounting for the bias toward higher concentrations
inherent in lensing selected samples. Our results are consistent with previous
studies which similarly detected a concentration excess, and increases the
total number of clusters studied with the combined strong and weak lensing
technique to ten. Combining our sample with previous work, we find that
clusters with larger Einstein radii are more anomalously concentrated. We also
present a detailed model of the lensing cluster A1703 with constraints from

formation. The evolution of massive stars depends sensitively on the
metallicity which has an impact on the intensity of the line driven stellar

observe any change in the form of the distribution curves describing the rate
of microlensing events for lenses in the Galactic halo. The corresponding
expected timescales and number of expected events also do not vary. Conversely,

Interferometric VLA observations of the OH 18 cm transitions in K~3-35 are
presented.OH maser emission is detected in all four ground state lines (1612,
1665, 1667, and 1720 MHz). All the masers appear blueshifted with respect to
the systemic velocity of the nebula and they have different spatial and
kinematic distributions.The OH 1665 and 1720 MHz masers appear spatially
coincident with the core of the nebula, while the OH 1612 and 1667 MHz ones
exhibit a more extended distribution. We suggest that the 1665 and 1720 masers
arise from a region close to the central star, possibly in a torus, while the
1612 and 1667 lines originate mainly from the extended northern lobe of the
outflow. It is worth noting that the location and velocity of the OH 1720 MHz
maser emission are very similar to those of the H2O masers (coinciding within
0.1"" and ~2 km/s, respectively). We suggest that the pumping mechanism in the
H2O masers could be produced by the same shock that is exciting the OH 1720 MHz
transition. A high degree of circular polarization (>50%) was found to be
present in some features of the 1612, 1665, and 1720 MHz emission.For the 1665
MHz transition at ~ +18 km/s the emission with left and right circular
polarizations (LCP and RCP) coincide spatially within a region of ~0.03"" in

  Applying our code to simulate the turbulent plasma motion within a typical
interstellar molecular cloud, we investigate the influence of different
equations of state (isothermal and adiabatic) on the statistical properties of
the resulting turbulent structures. We find slightly different density power
spectra and dispersion maps, while both cases yield qualitatively similar
dissipative structures, and exhibit a departure from the classical Kolmogorov
case towards a scaling described by the She-Leveque model.
  Solving the full energy equation with realistic heating/cooling terms
appropriate for the diffuse interstellar gas, we are able to reproduce a
realistic two-phase distribution of cold and warm plasma. When extracting maps
of polarised intensity from our simulation data, we find encouraging similarity
to actual observations. Finally, we compare the actual magnetic field strength
of our simulations to its value inferred from the rotation measure. We find
these to be systematically different by a factor of about 1.5, thus
highlighting the often underestimated influence of varying line-of-sight
particle densities on the magnetic field strength derived from observed
rotation measures.

frustrated square lattice model to materials lacking tetragonal symmetry. We
focus on the case of layered vanadium phosphates AA'VO(PO4)2 (AA' = Pb2, SrZn,
BaZn, and BaCd). To provide a proper microscopic description of these
compounds, we use extensive band structure calculations for real materials and
model structures and supplement this analysis with simulations of thermodynamic
properties, thus facilitating a direct comparison with the experimental data.
Due to the reduced symmetry, the realistic spin model of layered vanadium
phosphates AA'VO(PO4)2 includes four inequivalent exchange couplings: J1 and
J1' between nearest-neighbors and J2 and J2' between next-nearest-neighbors.
The estimates of individual exchange couplings suggest different regimes, from
J1'/J1 and J2'/J2 close to 1 in BaCdVO(PO4)2, a nearly regular frustrated
square lattice, to J1'/J1 ~ 0.7 and J2'/J2 ~ 0.4 in SrZnVO(PO4)2, a frustrated
square lattice with sizable distortion. The underlying structural differences
are analyzed, and the key factors causing the distortion of the spin lattice in
layered vanadium compounds are discussed. We propose possible routes for
finding new frustrated square lattice materials among complex vanadium oxides.
Full diagonalization simulations of thermodynamic properties indicate the
similarity of the extended model to the regular one with averaged couplings. In
case of moderate frustration and moderate distortion, valid for all the
AA'VO(PO4)2 compounds reported so far, the distorted spin lattice can be
considered as a regular square lattice with the couplings (J1+J1')/2 between
nearest-neighbors and (J2+J2')/2 between next-nearest-neighbors.

PST of a qubit over distance regular spin networks and optimal state transfer
(ST) of a $d$-level quantum state (qudit) over pseudo distance regular networks
were discussed, where the networks considered there were not in general related
with a certain finite group. In this paper, PST of a qudit over antipodes of
more general networks called underlying networks of association schemes, is
investigated. In particular, we consider the underlying networks of group
association schemes in order to employ the group properties (such as
irreducible characters) and use the algebraic structure of these networks (such
as Bose-Mesner algebra) in order to give an explicit analytical formula for
coupling constants in the Hamiltonians so that the state of a particular qudit
initially encoded on one site will perfectly evolve to the opposite site
without any dynamical control. It is shown that the only necessary condition in
order to PST over these networks be achieved is that the centers of the
corresponding groups be non-trivial. Therefore, PST over the underlying
networks of the group association schemes over all the groups with non-trivial
centers such as the abelian groups, the dihedral group $D_{2n}$ with even $n$,
the Clifford group CL(n) and all of the $p$-groups can be achieved.

understood as information that each one carries about the other. In order to
give a model-independent description of secure information disposal, we propose
the paradigm of private quantum decoupling, corresponding to locally reducing
correlations in a given bipartite quantum state without transferring them to
the environment. In this framework, the concept of private local randomness
naturally arises as a resource, and total correlations get divided into
eliminable and ineliminable ones. We prove upper and lower bounds on the amount
of ineliminable correlations present in an arbitrary bipartite state, and show
that, in tripartite pure states, ineliminable correlations satisfy a monogamy
constraint, making apparent their quantum nature. A relation with entanglement
theory is provided by showing that ineliminable correlations constitute an
entanglement parameter. In the limit of infinitely many copies of the initial
state provided, we compute the regularized ineliminable correlations to be
measured by the coherent information, which is thus equipped with a new
operational interpretation. In particular, our results imply that two
subsystems can be privately decoupled if their joint state is separable.

The difference in incubation times - both described by characteristic

in asteroseismology to probe the instantaneous inner structure of a star,
measured changes in the pulsation frequencies as derived from an O-C diagram

represented by density operators. A control design based on the Hilbert-Schmidt
distance as a Lyapunov function is considered. The control dynamics is
redefined on an extended space where the LaSalle invariance principle can be
correctly applied even for non-stationary target states. LaSalle's invariance
principle is used to derive a general characterization of the invariant set,
which is shown to always contain the critical points of the Lyapunov function.
Critical point analysis of the latter is used to show that, for generic states,
it is a Morse function with $n!$ isolated critical points, including one global
minimum, one global maximum and $n!-2$ saddles. It is also shown, however, that
the actual dynamics of the system is not a gradient flow, and therefore a full
eigenvalue analysis of the linearized dynamics about the critical points of the
dynamical system is necessary to ascertain stability of the critical points.
This analysis shows that a generic target state is locally asymptotically
stable if the linearized system is controllable and the invariant set is
regular, and in fact convergence to the target state (trajectory) in this case
is almost global in that the stable manifolds of all other critical points form
a subset of measure zero of the state space. On the other hand, if either of
these sufficient conditions is not satisfied, the target state ceases to be
asymptotically stable, a center manifold emerges around the target state, and
the control design ceases to be effective.

or long-period (g-mode) luminosity variations, with two objects so far known to
exhibit hybrid behaviour, i.e. showing both types of modes at the same time.
The pulsating subdwarf B star V391 Pegasi (or HS2201+2610), which is close to
the two known hybrid pulsators in the log g - Teff plane, has recently been
discovered to host a planetary companion. In order to learn more about the
planetary companion and its possible influence on the evolution of its host
star (subdwarf B star formation is still not well understood), an accurate
characterisation of the host star is required. As part of an ongoing effort to
significantly improve the asteroseismic characterisation of the host star, we
investigate the low-frequency behaviour of HS2201+2610. We obtained rapid high
signal-to-noise photometric CCD (B-filter) and PMT (clear-filter) data at
2m-class telescopes and carried out a careful frequency analysis of the light
curves. In addition to the previously known short-period luminosity variations
in the range 342s-367s, we find a long-period variation with a period of 54min
and an amplitude of 0.15 per cent. This can most plausibly be identified with a
g-mode pulsation, so that HS2201+2610 is a new addition to the short list of
hybrid sdB pulsators. Along with the previously known pulsating subdwarf B
stars HS0702+6043 and Balloon090100001 showing hybrid behaviour, the new hybrid
HS2201+2610 is the third member of this class. This important property of
HS2201+2610 can lead to a better characterisation of this planet-hosting star,
helping the characterisation of its planetary companion as well. Current
pulsation models cannot yet reproduce hybrid sdBV stars particularly well and
improved pulsation models for this object have to include the hybrid behaviour.

Late stages of these jets may loose the SN traces and appear as a short GRB or
a long orphan GRB (depending on jet angular velocity and view angle). XRF are

originated by Inverse Compton and-or Synchrotron Radiation at pulsars or
micro-quasars sources, by ultra-relativistic electrons. These Jets are most
powerful at Supernova birth, blazing, once on axis, to us and flashing GRB

multi-explosive structure of different GRBs. The jets are precessing (by binary
companion or inner disk asymmetry) and decaying by power on time scales of few
hours, but they keep staying inside the observer cone view only a few seconds
duration times (GRB); the jet is thinner in gamma and wider in X band. This

gauge configurations parameterized by wedge states play an essential role.
These pure gauge configurations are constructed as perturbation expansions and
to guaranty that these configurations are asymptotical solutions to equations
of motions one needs to study convergence of the perturbation expansions. We
demonstrate that for the large parameter of the perturbation expansion these
pure gauge truncated configurations give divergent contributions to the
equation of motion on the subspace of the wedge states. We perform this
demonstration numerically for the pure gauge configurations related to tachyon
solutions for the bosonic and the NS fermionic SFT. By the numerical
calculations we also show that the perturbation expansions are cured by adding
extra terms. These terms are nothing but the terms necessary to make valued the
Sen conjectures.

  Sciences",,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An ""exotic"" idea proposed by Viktor Ambartsumian was that new galaxies are
formed through the ejection from older active galaxies. Galaxies beget
galaxies, instead of the standard scenario in which galaxies stem from the
evolution of the seeds derived from fluctuations in the initial density field.
This idea is in some way contained in the speculative proposal that some or all
QSOs might be objects ejected by nearby galaxies, and that their redshift is
not cosmological (Arp, G./M. Burbidge and others).
  I will discuss some of the arguments for and against this scenario; in
particular, I shall talk about the existence of real physical connections in
apparently discordant QSO-galaxy redshift associations. On the one hand, there
are many statistical correlations of high-redshift QSOs and nearby galaxies
that cannot yet be explained in terms of gravitational lensing, biases, or
selection effects; and some particular configurations have very low
probabilities of being a projection of background objects. Our understanding of
QSOs in general is also far from complete. On the other hand, some cases which
were claimed to be anomalous in the past have found an explanation in standard
terms. As an example, I will show some cases of our own research into this
type: statistics of ULXs around nearby galaxies, and the Flesch & Hardcastle
candidate QSOs catalog analysis. My own conclusion is neutral.

small angular scales (l > 1800). Using the GBT survey, we find currently known
radio source populations are not capable of generating the power; a new
population of faint sources with steeply rising spectral indices would be
required to explain the excess with sources... We also present a full

an alloyed wire with 10 wt.% B4C are presented The strongest enhancement was
measured at 20K, where cold densification at 1.85 GPa on a binary Fe/MgB2 wire
raised both Jcpara and Jcperp by more than 300% at 5T, while Birr was enhanced
by 0.7 T. At 4.2K, the enhancement of Jc was smaller, but still reached 53% at
10 T. After applying pressures up to 6.5 GPa, the mass density dm of the
unreacted (B+Mg) mixture inside the filaments reached 96% of the theoretical
density. After reaction under atmospheric pressure, this corresponds to a
highest mass density df in the MgB2 filaments of 73%. After reaction, the
electrical resistance of wires submitted to cold densification was found to
decrease, reflecting an improved connectivity. A quantitative correlation
between filament mass density and the physical properties was established.
Monofilamentary rectangular wires with aspect ratios a/b < 1.25 based on low
energy ball milled powders exhibited very low anisotropy ratios, Gamma =
Jcpara/Jcperp being < 1.4 at 4.2 K and 10T. The present results can be
generalized to alloyed MgB2 wires, as demonstrated on a wire with B4C
additives. Based on the present data, it follows that cold densification has
the potential of further improving the highest Jcpara and Jcperp values
reported so far for in situ MgB2 tapes and wires with SiC and C additives.
Investigations are under work in our laboratory to determine whether the
densification method CHPD can be applied to longer wire or tape lengths.

solution of the 2D NSE vorticity transport equation, and simultaneously solving
the Poisson problem between the vorticity and stream function, in the region to

(WR) star WR142 with the XMM-Newton X-ray telescope. Being of spectral subtype
WO2, WR142 is a massive star in a very advanced evolutionary stage, short
before its explosion as a supernova or gamma-ray burst. This is the first
detection of X-ray emission from a WO-type star. We rule out any serendipitous
X-ray sources within approx 1"" of WR142. WR142 has an X-ray luminosity of
L_X=7\times10^{30} erg/s, which constitutes only $\lsim 10^{-8}$ of its
bolometric luminosity. The hard X-ray spectrum suggests a plasma temperature of
about 100 MK. Commonly, X-ray emission from stellar winds is attributed to
embedded shocks due to the intrinsic instability of the radiation driving. From
qualitative considerations we conclude that this mechanism cannot account for
the hardness of the observed radiation. There are no hints for a binary
companion. Therefore the only remaining, albeit speculative explanation must
refer to magnetic activity. Possibly related, WR142 seems to rotate extremely
fast, as indicated by the unusually round profiles of its optical emission
lines. Our detection implies that the wind of WR142 must be relatively
transparent to X-rays, which can be due to strong wind ionization, wind
clumping, or non-spherical geometry from rapid rotation.

theoretical and empirical studies of both the IGM and galaxy formation. We
present here a new calculation of its spectrum that satisfies the empirical
constraints we recently obtained by combining state-of-the-art luminosity
functions and intergalactic opacity measurements. In our preferred model,
star-forming galaxies and quasars each contribute substantially to the HI
ionizing field at z<3, with galaxies rapidly overtaking quasars at higher
redshifts as quasars become rarer. In addition to our fiducial model, we
explore the physical dependences of the calculated background and clarify how
recombination emission contributes to the ionization rates. We find that
recombinations do not simply boost the ionization rates by the number of
reemitted ionizing photons as many of these rapidly redshift below the
ionization edges and have a distribution of energies. A simple analytic model
that captures the main effects seen in our numerical radiative transfer
calculations is given. Finally, we discuss the effects of HeII reionization by
quasars on both the spectrum of the ionizing background and on the thermal
history of the IGM. In regions that have yet to be reionized, the spectrum is
expected to be almost completely suppressed immediately above 54.4 eV while a
background of higher-energy (>~0.5 keV) photons permeates the entire universe
owing to the frequency-dependence of the photoionization cross section. We
provide an analytic model of the heat input during HeII reionization and its
effects on the temperature-density relation.

homogeneous **intrinsic** colour distributions, featuring red cores with small

size evolution to the amount of dissipation during major mergers. However, in a

modeled as planar disks with in-plane and out-of-plane vibrational dipoles. As
first pointed out by Leger (1988), infrared emission features resulting from
in-plane and out-of-plane modes should have orthogonal polarization directions.
We show analytically how the degree of polarization depends on the viewing
geometry and the molecule's internal alignment between principal axis of
inertia and angular momentum, which gets worse after photon absorption. Longer
wavelength features, emitted after better internal alignment is recovered,
should be more strongly polarized. The degree of polarization for
uni-directional illumination (e.g., by a star) is larger than for diffuse
illumination (e.g., by a disk galaxy), all else being equal. For PAHs in the
Cold Neutral Medium, the predicted polarization is probably too small to
distinguish from the contribution of linear dichroism by aligned foreground
dust. The level of polarization predicted for PAH emission from the Orion Bar
is only ~0.06% at 3.3 microns; Sellgren et al. (1988) report a much larger
value, 0.86+-0.28%, which suggests that the smallest PAHs may have moderately
suprathermal rotation rates. Future observations of (or upper limits on) the
degree of polarization for the Orion Bar or for dust above edge-on galaxies
(e.g., NGC 891 or M82) may constrain the internal alignment of emitting PAHs,

challenge for models of structure formation. In the ultra small-scale limit,
CDM structures form nearly simultaneously across a wide range of scales.
Hierarchical clustering no longer provides a guiding principle for theoretical
analyses and the computation time required to carry out credible simulations
becomes prohibitively high. To gain insight into this problem, we perform
high-resolution (N=720^3 - 1584^3) simulations of an Einstein-de Sitter
cosmology where the initial power spectrum is P(k) propto k^n, with -2.5 < n <
-1. Self-similar scaling is established for n=-1 and n=-2 more convincingly
than in previous, lower-resolution simulations and for the first time,
self-similar scaling is established for an n=-2.25 simulation. However, finite
box-size effects induce departures from self-similar scaling in our n=-2.5
simulation. We compare our results with the predictions for the power spectrum
from (one-loop) perturbation theory and demonstrate that the renormalization
group approach suggested by McDonald improves perturbation theory's ability to
predict the power spectrum in the quasilinear regime. In the nonlinear regime,
our power spectra differ significantly from the widely used fitting formulae of
Peacock & Dodds and Smith et al. and a new fitting formula is presented.
Implications of our results for the stable clustering hypothesis vs. halo model
debate are discussed. Our power spectra are inconsistent with predictions of
the stable clustering hypothesis in the high-k limit and lend credence to the
halo model. Nevertheless, the fitting formula advocated in this paper is purely
empirical and not derived from a specific formulation of the halo model.

investigate whether observations of the acoustic power can be used to detect
emerging active regions before they appear on the surface. In the simulations,
subsurface structures are modeled as regions with enhanced or reduced acoustic

an important problem that could provide insight into biological understanding
and therapeutics. For technical reasons, comparing large networks is
computationally infeasible, and thus heuristics such as the degree distribution
have been sought. It is easy to demonstrate that two networks are different by
simply showing a short list of properties in which they differ. It is much
harder to show that two networks are similar, as it requires demonstrating
their similarity in all of their exponentially many properties. Clearly, it is
computationally prohibitive to analyze all network properties, but the larger
the number of constraints we impose in determining network similarity, the more
likely it is that the networks will truly be similar.
  We introduce a new systematic measure of a network's local structure that
imposes a large number of similarity constraints on networks being compared. In
particular, we generalize the degree distribution, which measures the number of
nodes 'touching' k edges, into distributions measuring the number of nodes
'touching' k graphlets, where graphlets are small connected non-isomorphic
subgraphs of a large network. Our new measure of network local structure
consists of 73 graphlet degree distributions (GDDs) of graphlets with 2-5
nodes, but it is easily extendible to a greater number of constraints (i.e.
graphlets). Furthermore, we show a way to combine the 73 GDDs into a network
'agreement' measure. Based on this new network agreement measure, we show that
almost all of the 14 eukaryotic PPI networks, including human, are better
modeled by geometric random graphs than by Erdos-Reny, random scale-free, or
Barabasi-Albert scale-free networks.

of exchange-correlation and kinetic energies. Based on the perturbation theory
of ""quasiatoms"" and density functional theory, the new embedding function
captures the essential physics missing in UDA, and paves the way for developing
more transferable EAM potentials. With Voter-Chen EAM potential as an example,
we show that the gradient corrections can significantly improve the
transferability of the potential.

does conventional turbulence. A general introduction to this issue and a brief
review of the basic concepts are followed by a description of vortex lattice

Kullback-Leibler divergence between the full model and its projection onto a
submodel has recently been suggested in the literature. Here we extend this
idea by considering projections onto subspaces defined via some form of $L_1$
constraint on the parameter in the full model. This leads to Bayesian model
selection approaches related to the lasso. In the posterior distribution of the
projection there is positive probability that some components are exactly zero
and the posterior distribution on the model space induced by the projection
allows exploration of model uncertainty. We also consider use of the approach
in structured variable selection problems such as ANOVA models where it is
desired to incorporate main effects in the presence of interactions. Here we
make use of projections related to the non-negative garotte which are able to
respect the hierarchical constraints. We also prove a consistency result
concerning the posterior distribution on the model induced by the projection,
and show that for some projections related to the adaptive lasso and
non-negative garotte the posterior distribution concentrates on the true model
asymptotically.

LaFeAsO$_{0.7}$ ($T_{c}=$ 28 K), the spin component of the $^{57}$Fe-Knight

of the superconducting state formed by spin-singlet Cooper pairing. The nuclear

superconducting state is commonly realized in these Fe-based pnictide

extended s$_{\pm}$-wave pairing with a sign reversal of the order parameter

gradually increases upon cooling in Ba$_{0.6}$K$_{0.4}$Fe$_2$As$_2$. Despite

planetary system is of particular interest because it has an orbital period of
9.202 days, the second longest one among the transiting planets known to date.
We study the surface rotation and the activity of the host star during an
uninterrupted sequence of optical observations of 58 days. Our approach is
based on a maximum entropy spot modelling technique extensively tested by
modelling the variation of the total solar irradiance. It assumes that stellar
active regions consist of cool spots and bright faculae, analogous to sunspots
and solar photospheric faculae, whose visibility is modulated by stellar
rotation. The modelling of the light curve of CoRoT-Exo-4a reveals three main
active longitudes with lifetimes between about 30 and 60 days that rotate
quasi-synchronously with the orbital motion of the planet. The different
rotation rates of the active longitudes are interpreted in terms of surface
differential rotation and a lower limit of 0.057 \pm 0.015 is derived for its
relative amplitude. The enhancement of activity observed close to the
subplanetary longitude suggests a magnetic star-planet interaction, although
the short duration of the time series prevents us from drawing definite
conclusions.

Sky survay, we derive the profiles of components constituting the NGC 1550

(oxygen, silicon, and iron) are extended to $\sim 200$ kpc from the center,
wherein $\sim$ 70% of the $K$-band luminosity is carried by NGC 1550 itself. As
first revealed with {\it ASCA}, the data reconfirms the presence of a dark
halo, of which the mass ($1.6 \times 10^{13} M_{\odot}$) is typical of a galaxy
group rather than of a single galaxy. Within 210 kpc, the $K$-band
mass-to-light ratio reaches $75 M_{\odot}/L_{\odot}$, which is comparable to
those of clusters of galaxies. The iron-mass-to-light ratio profile (silicon-
and oxygen mass-to-light ratio profiles as well) exhibits about two orders of
magnitude decrease toward the center. Further studies comparing mass densities
of metals with those of the other cluster components reveal that the iron (as
well as silicon) in the ICM traces very well the total gravitating mass,
whereas the stellar component is significantly more concentrated to within
several tens kpc of the NGC 1550 nucleus. Thus, in the central region, the
amount of metals is significantly depleted for the luminous galaxy light. Among
a few possible explanations of this effect, the most likely scenario is that
galaxies in this system were initially much more extended than today, and
gradually fell to the center and merged into NGC 1550.

nonaxisymmetric deformations, because of its finite shear modulus, and can

are governed by the effective actions that are derived from the Hubbard model

of the particle, energy, and momentum conservations we show that for large
evolution times the ratio of the longitudinal and transverse pressures of the

distribution elongated along the beam axis always passes through the isotropic
stage where the transverse and longitudinal pressures are equal. The inclusion
of the magnetic field in this case gives negative contribution to the

supersymmetric super Yang--Mills and supergravity theories in various

conventional, light-cone, harmonic and certain non-Lorentz covariant
superspaces, and we write down explicitly the relevant invariants. While the
first two types of superspace admit the possibility of one-half BPS
counterterms, of the form $F^4$ and $R^4$ respectively, the last two do not.
This suggests that UV divergences begin with one-quarter BPS counterterms, i.e.
$d^2 F^4$ and $d^4 R^4$, and this is supported by an entirely different
approach based on algebraic renormalisation. The algebraic formalism is
discussed for non-renormalisable theories and it is shown how the allowable
supersymmetric counterterms can be determined via cohomological methods. These
results are in agreement with all the explicit computations that have been
carried out to date. In particular, they suggest that maximal supergravity is
likely to diverge at four loops in D=5 and at five loops in D=4, unless other
infinity suppression mechanisms not involving supersymmetry or gauge invariance

are assumed to satisfy an a priori unknown linear homogeneous differential

problem has practical importance in Signal Processing and other applications.
  It is somewhat of a ``folklore'' that the sequence of the moments of such

bounded order and degree. We derive this recurrence relation explicitly. It
turns out that the coefficients of the differential operator which annihilates
every piece of the function, as well as the locations of the discontinuities,
appear in this recurrence in a precisely controlled manner. This leads to the
formulation of a generic algorithm for reconstructing a piecewise D-finite
function from its moments. We investigate the conditions for solvability of the
resulting linear systems in the general case, as well as analyze a few
particular examples. We provide results of numerical simulations for several

method for substantially increasing the secret key rate and distance that can
be covered by QKD protocols with practical signals. The security analysis of
these schemes, however, leaves open the possibility that the development of
better proof techniques, or better classical post-processing methods, might
further improve their performance in realistic scenarios. In this paper, we
derive upper bounds on the secure key rate for decoy state QKD. These bounds
are based basically only on the classical correlations established by the
legitimate users during the quantum communication phase of the protocol. The
only assumption about the possible post-processing methods is that double click
events are randomly assigned to single click events. Further we consider only
secure key rates based on the uncalibrated device scenario which assigns
imperfections such as detection inefficiency to the eavesdropper. Our analysis
relies on two preconditions for secure two-way and one-way QKD: The legitimate
users need to prove that there exists no separable state (in the case of
two-way QKD), or that there exists no quantum state having a symmetric
extension (one-way QKD), that is compatible with the available measurements
results. Both criteria have been previously applied to evaluate single-photon
implementations of QKD. Here we use them to investigate a realistic source of
weak coherent pulses. The resulting upper bounds can be formulated as a convex
optimization problem known as a semidefinite program which can be efficiently
solved. For the standard four-state QKD protocol, they are quite close to known
lower bounds, thus showing that there are clear limits to the further
improvement of classical post-processing techniques in decoy state QKD.

transition from a high temperature, tetragonal phase to a low temperature

application of pressure this phase transition is rapidly suppressed and by ~
0.35 GPa it is replaced by a first order phase transition to a low temperature
collapsed tetragonal, non-magnetic phase. Further application of pressure leads
to an increase of the tetragonal to collapsed tetragonal phase transition
temperature, with it crossing room temperature by ~ 1.7 GPa. Given the
exceptionally large and anisotropic change in unit cell dimensions associated
with the collapsed tetragonal phase, the state of the pressure medium (liquid
or solid) at the transition temperature has profound effects on the low
temperature state of the sample. For He-gas cells the pressure is as close to
hydrostatic as possible and the transitions are sharp and the sample appears to
be single phase at low temperatures. For liquid media cells at temperatures
below media freezing, the CaFe2As2 transforms when it is encased by a frozen
media and enters into a low temperature multi-crystallographic-phase state,
leading to what appears to be a strain stabilized superconducting state at low

sequences of non-negative integers. It is well-known that these sequences are
so-called \emph{complementary homogeneous}
  \emph{Beatty sequences}, that is they satisfy Beatty's theorem. For a
positive integer $p$, we generalize the solution of $m$-Wythoff Nim to a pair
of \emph{$p$-complementary}---each positive integer occurs exactly $p$
times---homogeneous Beatty sequences $a = (a_n)_{n\in \M}$ and $b = (b_n)_{n\in

we show that $a$ and $b$ are unique among \emph{all} pairs of non-decreasing
$p$-complementary sequences. We prove that such pairs can be partitioned into
$p$ pairs of complementary Beatty sequences. Our main results are that
$\{\{a_n,b_n\}\mid n\in \M\}$ represents the solution to three new
'$p$-restrictions' of $m$-Wythoff Nim---of which one has a \emph{blocking
maneuver} on the \emph{rook-type} options. C. Kimberling has shown that the
solution of Wythoff Nim satisfies the \emph{complementary equation}
$x_{x_n}=y_n - 1$. We generalize this formula to a certain '$p$-complementary
equation' satisfied by our pair $a$ and $b$. We also show that one may obtain
our new pair of sequences by three so-called \emph{Minimal EXclusive}
algorithms. We conclude with an Appendix by Aviezri Fraenkel.

abstract of the Heisenberg commutation relation $[\frac{d}{dx}, x] = {\bf id}$.
The Umbral Clifford analysis provides an effective framework in continuity and
discreteness.
  In this paper we consider functions defined in a star-like domain $\Omega
\subset \BR^n$ with values in the Umbral Clifford algebra $C\ell_{0,n}'$ which
are Umbral polymonogenic with respect to the (left) Umbral Dirac operator $D'$,
i.e. they belong to the kernel of $(D')^k$. We prove that any polymonogenic
function $f$ has a decomposition of the form $$f=f_1+ x'f_2 + ... +
(x')^{k-1}f_k,$$ where $x'=x'_1e_1 + ... + x'_ne_n$ and $f_j, j=1,..., k,$ are
Umbral monogenic functions. As examples, this result recoveries the continuous
version of the classical Almansi theorem for derivatives and establishes the
discrete version of Almansi theorem for difference operator. The approach also
provides a similar result in quantum field about Almansi decomposition related
to Hamilton operators.
  Some concrete examples will presented for the discrete analog version of
Almansi Decomposition and for the quantum harmonic oscillator.

description, but are usually only considered in a single-mode representation.
In general, the important claim in decoy-based QKD protocols for
indistinguishability between signal and decoy states does not hold for all
sources. We derive new bounds on the single photon transmission probability and
error rate for multi-mode states, and apply these bounds to the output state of
a PDC source. We observe two opposing effects on the secure key rate. First,
the multi-mode structure of the state gives rise to a new attack that decreases
the key rate. Second, more contributing modes change the photon number

resistive instability which leads to a change of the topology of the field
configuration from pre- to post reconnection state. On the contrary, the
topological trigger is a quick change of the global topology, which dictates
the fast reconnection of collisional or collisionless nature. The current state

that, in addition to the one loop contribution of the Standard Model (SM), the

strong mixing of transitions is found. Within T DLDA the first peak is slightly
higher in energy than in earlier independent-par ticle calculations. However,
the absorption onset and in particular its composit ion dependence is similar

torus-invariant primitive ideals in $m\times n$ quantum matrices can be seen as
a regular language in a natural way. Using this description and a semigroup
approach to the set of Cauchon diagrams, a combinatorial object that
paramaterizes the primes that are torus-invariant, we show that for $m$ fixed,
the number of torus-invariant primitive ideals in $m\times n$ quantum matrices
satisfies a linear recurrence in $n$ over the rational numbers. In the $3\times
n$ case we give a concrete description of the torus-invariant primitive ideals
and use this description to give an explicit formula for the number P(3,n).

covariant quantization of the free minimally coupled scalar field in de Sitter
spacetime [1,2]. In this processes ultraviolet and infrared divergences have
been automatically eliminated [3]. A natural renormalization of the one-loop
interacting quantum field in Minkowski spacetime ($\lambda\phi^4$) has been
achieved through the consideration of the negative-norm states defined in Krein
space. It has been shown that the combination of quantum field theory in Krein
space together with consideration of quantum metric fluctuation, results in
quantum field theory without any divergences [4]. Pursuing this approach, we
express Wick's theorem and calculate M{\o}ller scattering in the one-loop
approximation in Krein space. The mathematical consequence of this method is
the disappearance of the ultraviolet divergence in the one-loop approximation.
