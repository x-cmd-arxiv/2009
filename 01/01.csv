flavor instantons in bulk of size 1/\sqrt{\lambda} with \lambda=g^2*N_c. Using
the ADHM construction we explicit the exact two-instanton solution in bulk. We
use it to construct the core NN potential to order N_c/\lambda. The core
sources meson fields to order \sqrt{N_c/\lambda} which are shown to contribute
to the NN interaction to order N_c/\lambda. In holographic QCD, the NN
interaction splits into a small core and a large cloud contribution in line
with meson exchange models. The core part of the interaction is repulsive in
the central, spin and tensor channels for instantons in the regular gauge. The
cloud part of the interaction is dominated by omega exchange in the central
channel, by pion exchange in the tensor channel and by axial-vector exchange in
the spin and tensor channels. Vector meson exchanges are subdominant in all

October-November 2002 was followed by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer for more
than a month. We demonstrate how the area covered by the hotspot at the neutron
star surface is decreasing in the course of the outburst together with the
reflection amplitude. These trends are in agreement with the natural scenario,
where the disc inner edge is receding from the neutron star as the mass
accretion rate drops. These findings are further supported by the variations of
the pulse profiles, which clearly show the presence of the secondary maximum at
the late stages of the outburst after October 29. This fact can be interpreted
as the disc receding sufficiently far from the neutron star to open the view of
the lower magnetic pole. In that case, the disc inner radius can be estimated.
Assuming that disc is truncated at the Alfv\'en radius, we constrain the
stellar magnetic moment to \mu=(9\pm5) 10^{25} G cm^3, which corresponds to the
surface field of 10^8 G. On the other hand, using the magnetic moment recently
obtained from the observed pulsar spin-down rate we show that the disc edge has
to be within factor of two of the Alfv\'en radius, putting interesting
constraints on the models of the disc-magnetosphere interaction. We also
demonstrate that the sharp changes in the phase of the fundamental are
intimately related to the variations of the pulse profile, which we associate
with the varying obscuration of the antipodal spot. The pulse profile amplitude
allows us to estimate the colatitude of the hotspot centroid to be 4-10 deg.

comparison of its mid-infrared properties to the expectations of the unified

of different Seyfert types, as well as N-band SEDs of 20 of them. In addition,
we compare our results for 19 of them to Spitzer IRS spectra. Results. We find
that at a resolution of ~ 0.35"", all the nuclei of our observed sources are
point-like, except for 2 objects whose extension is likely of instrumental
origin. For 3 objects, however, we observed additional extended circumnuclear
emission, even though our observational strategy was not designed to detect it.
Comparison of the VISIR photometry and Spitzer spectrophotometry indicates that
the latter is affected by extended emission in at least 7 out of 19 objects and
the level of contamination is (0.20 ~ 0.85) * F_IRS. In particular, the 10 um
silicate emission feature seen in the Spitzer spectra of 6 type I AGN, possibly
1 type II AGN and 2 LINERs, also probably originates not solely in the torus
but also in extended regions. Conclusions. Our results generally agree with the
expectations from the unified scenario, while the relative weakness of the
silicate feature supports clumpy torus models. Our VISIR data indicate that,
for low-redshift AGN, a large fraction of Spitzer IRS spectra are contaminated
by extended emission close to the AGN.

understanding the network stability region under amplify-and-forward scheme is

computation of the electrostatic energy and forces to any desired accuracy in a
system with arbitrary dielectric properties is presented. An integral equation
for the scalar charge density is derived from an energy functional of the
polarization vector field. This energy functional represents the true energy of
the system even in non-equilibrium states. Arbitrary accuracy is achieved by
solving the integral equation for the charge density via a series expansion in
terms of the equation's kernel, which depends only on the geometry of the
dielectrics. The streamlined formalism operates with volume charge
distributions only, not resorting to introducing surface charges by hand.
Therefore, it can be applied to any spatial variation of the dielectric
susceptibility, which is of particular importance in applications to
biomolecular systems. The simplicity of application of the formalism to real
problems is shown with analytical and numerical examples.

ordinary files rather than messages. While it has the significant benefits of
decoupling producer and consumer and allowing existing application programs to
be executed in parallel with no recoding, its typical implementation using
shared file systems places a high performance burden on the overall system and
on the user who will analyze and consume the downstream data. Previous efforts
have achieved great speedups with loosely coupled programs, but have done so
with careful manual tuning of all shared file system access. In this work, we
evaluate a prototype collective IO model for file-based MTC. The model enables
efficient and easy distribution of input data files to computing nodes and
gathering of output results from them. It eliminates the need for such manual
tuning and makes the programming of large-scale clusters using a loosely
coupled model easier. Our approach, inspired by in-memory approaches to
collective operations for parallel programming, builds on fast local file
systems to provide high-speed local file caches for parallel scripts, uses a
broadcast approach to handle distribution of common input data, and uses
efficient scatter/gather and caching techniques for input and output. We
describe the design of the prototype model, its implementation on the Blue

accessible. A wide range of novel reflective behaviors ensues; including the
phenomenon of negative reflection were energy transport remains on the same

alignment by radiation and we explore the efficiency of dust alignment in T

Central proto-star are more efficiently aligned. In the presence of a regular
magnetic field, the aligned grains produce polarized emission in sub-mm/FIR
wavelengths. The direction of polarization is perpendicular to the local
magnetic field direction. When we use a recent T Tauri disk model and take a

of all, formulating of the analytical model of RATs. This model was shown to
reproduce well the torques acting on actual irregular dust grains and allowed
studies of the parameter space for which the alignment happens with long axes
perpendicular and parallel to the magnetic field. Such a study resulted in an
important conclusion that, without any paramagnetic relaxation, the RAT
alignment always happens for interstellar grains with long axes perpendicular
to the magnetic field. We show that the gaseous bombardment in some cases
increases the degree of alignment by knocking out grains from the positions of
imperfect alignment when the grains rotate slowly to more stable positions of
perfect alignment where grains rotate fast. In terms of pinwheel torques,
important revisions have been made in the Lazarian and Draine model of grain
flipping and thermal trapping. Those, however, do not change the major
conclusion that very small grains (i.e. grain size smaller than ~0.03 micron)
should be marginally aligned. Recent work made the RAT alignment a predictive
theory which is ready for quantitative modeling of astrophysical polarization.

the value expected based on an evolutionary model of a Type Ia supernova with

The quantum anomaly that breaks the U(1) axial symmetry of massless QCD leaves
behind a flavor-singlet discrete chiral invariance. When the mass is turned on
this residual symmetry has a close connection with the strong CP violating
parameter theta. One result is that a first order transition is usually
expected when the strong CP violating angle passes through pi. This symmetry
can be understood either in terms of effective chiral Lagrangians or in terms

not follow the shortest path, which is to stay as close as possible to the
inner wall, but try to minimize the travel time. For this they accept to move
on a longer path with some distance to the corner, to avoid large densities and
by this succeed in maintaining a comparatively high speed. In many models of
pedestrian dynamics the basic rule of motion is often either ""move as far as
possible toward the destination"" or - reformulated - ""of all coordinates
accessible in this time step move to the one with the smallest distance to the
destination"". Atop of this rule modifications are placed to make the motion
more realistic. These modifications usually focus on local behavior and neglect
long-ranged effects. Compared to real pedestrians this leads to agents in a
simulation valuing the shortest path a lot better than the quickest. So, in a
situation as the movement of a large crowd around a corner, one needs an
additional element in a model of pedestrian dynamics that makes the agents
deviate from the rule of the shortest path. In this work it is shown, how this
can be achieved by using a flood fill dynamic potential field method, where
during the filling process the value of a field cell is not increased by 1, but
by a larger value, if it is occupied by an agent. This idea may be an obvious
one, however, the tricky part - and therefore in a strict sense the
contribution of this work - is a) to minimize unrealistic artifacts, as naive
flood fill metrics deviate considerably from the Euclidean metric and in this
respect yield large errors, b) do this with limited computational effort, and
c) keep agents' movement at very low densities unaltered.

formulation of the steady 2-D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations introduced
by Erturk et al. (Int. J. Numer. Methods Fluids, 50, 421-436) will be
presented. The benchmark driven cavity flow problem will be solved using the
introduced compact fourth order formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations with
two different line iterative semi-implicit methods for both second and fourth
order spatial accuracy. The extra CPU work needed for increasing the spatial
accuracy from second order (O(x2)) to fourth order (O(x4)) formulation will be
presented.

for dark energy. In the conformally transformed Einstein's frame, our model is
similar to {\it coupled quintessence} model. In such models, we consider
potentials for the scalar field which satisfy the slow-roll conditions:
$[(1/V)(dV/d\phi)]^2 << 1$ and $(1/V)(d^2V/d\phi^2) << 1$. For such potentials,
we show that the equation of state for the scalar field can be described by a
universal behaviour, provided the scalar field rolls only in the flat part of
the potentials where the slow-roll conditions are satisfied. Our work
generalizes the previous work by Scherrer and Sen \cite{scherrer} for minimally
coupled scalar field case. We have also studied the observational constraints
on the model parameters considering the Supernova and BAO observational data.

: G --> H between G and a Hausdorff topological group H is open. Clearly, every
compact Hausdorff group is minimal. It is well known that every infinite
compact Hausdorff group contains a non-trivial convergent sequence. We extend
this result to minimal abelian groups by proving that every infinite minimal
abelian group contains a non-trivial convergent sequence. Furthermore, we show
that ""abelian"" is essential and cannot be dropped. Indeed, for every
uncountable regular cardinal kappa we construct a Hausdorff group topology
T_kappa on the free group F(kappa) with kappa many generators having the
following properties:
  (i) (F(kappa), T_kappa) is a minimal group;
  (ii) every subset of F(kappa) of size less than kappa is T_kappa-discrete
(and thus also T_kappa-closed);
  (iii) there are no non-trivial proper T_kappa-closed normal subgroups of
F(kappa).
  In particular, all compact subsets of (F(kappa), T_kappa) are finite, and
every Hausdorff quotient group of (F(kappa), T_kappa) is minimal (that is,
(F(kappa), T_kappa) is totally minimal).

different superconducting volume fractions (Tc = 38K). 75As-NMR spectra
revealed that the magnetically ordered and superconducting phases are
microscopically separated. The spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 in the normal
state reflects the existence of a large two-dimensional antiferromagnetic spin
fluctuation. The 1/T1 in the superconducting state down to the lowest
measurement temperature T varies close to T^3. In addition, it exhibits no
coherence peak just below Tc. This shows a T dependence similar to those of
other iron pnictides.

  Insights and Future Challenges"", S. Jogee, L. Hao, G. Blanc, I. Marinova, eds",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bulges are of different types, morphologies and kinematics, from
pseudo-bulges, close to disk properties (Sersic index, rotation fraction,
flatenning), to classical de Vaucouleurs bulges, close to elliptical galaxies.
Secular evolution and bar development can give rise to pseudo-bulges. To ensure
prolonged secular evolution, gas flows are required along the galaxy life-time.
There is growing evidence for cold gas accretion around spiral galaxies. This
can explain the bar cycle of destruction and reformation, together with
pseudo-bulge formation. However, bulges can also be formed through major
mergers, minor mergers, and massive clumps early in the galaxy evolution. Bulge
formation is so efficient that it is difficult to explain the presence of
bulgeless galaxies today.

discuss the mechanism of epigenetic landscape. In our simplified model, a
minimal model, the network of the interaction among cells generates the
landscape epigenetically and the differentiation in developmental process is
understood as a self-organization. The effect of the regulation by gene
expression which is a key ingredient in development is renormalized into the
interaction and the environment. At earlier stage of the development the energy
landscape of the model is rugged with small amplitude. The state of cells in
such a landscape is susceptible to fluctuations and not uniquely determined.
These cells are regarded as stem cells. At later stage of the development the
landscape has a funnel-like structure corresponding to the canalization in
differentiation. The rewinding or stability of the differentiation is also
demonstrated by substituting test cells into the time sequence of the model
development.

of the genetic code evolution, the codon capture and ambiguous intermediate
scenarios, in a consistent manner. We sketch the lowest dimensional version of
our model, a minimal model, by introducing a physical quantity, codon level. On
the basis of the hierarchical structure of the codon levels two scenarios are
classified into two different routes of the evolutional process. In the case of
the ambiguous intermediate scenario we perform a simulation implemented cost
selection of amino acids and confirm a rapid transition of the code change.
Such rapidness reduces uncomfortableness of the non-unique translation of the
code at intermediate state that is the weakness of the scenario.
