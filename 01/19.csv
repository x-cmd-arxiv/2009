effect that magnetic fields have on the gravitational-wave emission produced
during the inspiral and merger of magnetized neutron stars. In particular, we
show that magnetic fields have an impact after the merger, because they are
amplified by a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, but also during the inspiral, most
likely because the magnetic tension reduces the stellar tidal deformation for
extremely large initial magnetic fields, B_0>~10^{17}G. We quantify the
influence of magnetic fields by computing the overlap, O, between the waveforms
produced during the inspiral by magnetized and unmagnetized binaries. We find
that for any realistic magnetic field strength B_0<~10^{14}G the overlap during
the inspiral is O>~0.999 and is quite insensitive to the mass of the neutron
stars. Only for unrealistically large magnetic fields like B_0~10^{17}G the
overlap does decrease noticeably, becoming at our resolutions O<~0.76/0.67 for
stars with baryon masses M_b~1.4/1.6 Msun, respectively. Because neutron stars
are expected to merge with magnetic fields ~10^{8}-10^{10}G and because present
detectors are sensitive to O<~0.995, we conclude that it is very unlikely that
the present detectors will be able to discern the presence of magnetic fields

phenomena and classify phenomena. A phenomenon occupies both time and space,
facts and inferences having physical counterparts which are phenomena of

a fact (f', f'') reports the success of a test of generic class f', the outcome

Facts then exist only within structures of a form dictated by constraints on
the structural design of tests. The model explains why responses of real time

homogeneous electric field (biased superlattice with equipopulated levels) is
studied within the tight-binding approximation, taking into account the
scattering by optical and acoustic phonons and by lateral disorder. It is found
that the distribution versus the in-plane kinetic energy depends essentially on
the ratio between the Bloch energy and the optical phonon energy. The in-plane
conductivity is calculated for low-doped structures at temperatures 4.2 K and
20 K. The negative conductivity is found for bias voltages corresponding to the
Bloch-phonon resonance condition.

max-margin structured learning and Bayesian-style estimation and combines and
extends their merits. Major innovations of this model include: 1) It
generalizes the extant Markov network prediction rule based on a point
estimator of weights to a Bayesian-style estimator that integrates over a
learned distribution of the weights. 2) It extends the conventional max-entropy
discrimination learning of classification rule to a new structural max-entropy
discrimination paradigm of learning the distribution of Markov networks. 3) It
subsumes the well-known and powerful Maximum Margin Markov network (M$^3$N) as
a special case, and leads to a model similar to an $L_1$-regularized M$^3$N
that is simultaneously primal and dual sparse, or other types of Markov network
by plugging in different prior distributions of the weights. 4) It offers a
simple inference algorithm that combines existing variational inference and
convex-optimization based M$^3$N solvers as subroutines. 5) It offers a
PAC-Bayesian style generalization bound. This work represents the first
successful attempt to combine Bayesian-style learning (based on generative
models) with structured maximum margin learning (based on a discriminative
model), and outperforms a wide array of competing methods for structured
input/output learning on both synthetic and real data sets.

studied. The substrate is assumed to grow in time following the power law
$t^\gamma$, where the growth index $\gamma$ is an arbitrary positive number.
Two different regimes are clearly identified: for small $\gamma$ the interface
becomes correlated, and the dynamics is dominated by diffusion; for large
$\gamma$ the interface stays uncorrelated, and the dynamics is dominated by
dilution. In this second regime, for short time intervals and spatial scales
the critical exponents corresponding to the non-growing substrate situation are
recovered. For long time differences or large spatial scales the situation is
different. Large spatial scales show the uncorrelated character of the growing
interface. Long time intervals are studied by means of the auto-correlation and
persistence exponents. It becomes apparent that dilution is the mechanism by
which correlations are propagated in this second case.

These flows are driven by two mass parameters from the maximally (N=8)

points, one with G_2 symmetry and the other with SU(3)xU(1) symmetry and N=2
supersymmetry. The generic flow, with unequal mass parameters, is N=1
supersymmetric but goes to the SU(3)xU(1) symmetric, N=2 supersymmetric fixed
point, where the masses are equal. The only flow that goes to the G_2 symmetric
point occurs when one of the mass parameters is set to zero. There is an N=1
supersymmetric flow from the G_2 symmetric point to the SU(3)xU(1) symmetric
point and supergravity gives a prediction of 1/\sqrt{6} for the anomalous
dimensions of the operators that drive this flow. We examine these flows from

results since N=1 supersymmetry in three dimensions is insufficient to protect

recent 'spectacle' of comet 17P/Holmes can be explained by a thick, air-tight
dust cover and the effects of H2O sublimation, which started when the comet
arrived at the heliocentric distance <= 2.5 AU. The porous structure inside the
nucleus provided enough surface for additional sublimation, which eventually
led to the break up of the dust cover and to the observed outburst. The
magnitude of the particle burst can be explained by the energy provided by
insolation, stored in the dust cover and the nucleus within the months before
the outburst: the subliming surface within the nucleus is more than one order
of magnitude larger than the geometric surface of the nucleus -- possibly an
indication of the latter's porous structure. Another surprise is that the
abundance ratios of several molecular species with respect to H2O are variable.
During this apparition, comet Holmes lost about 3% of its mass, corresponding
to a 'dirty ice' layer of 20m.

then independently aligned in parallel using any sequential approach. Further
fine tuning of the local alignments is achieved using constraints derived from
a global ancestor of the entire set. The proposed Sample-Align-D Algorithm has
been implemented on a cluster of workstations using MPI message passing
library. The accuracy of the proposed solution has been tested on standard
benchmarks such as PREFAB. The accuracy of the alignment produced by our
methods is comparable to that of well known sequential MSA techniques. We were

  conference 09, LNCS",,,,"q-bio.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Pyrosequencing is among the emerging sequencing techniques, capable of
generating upto 100,000 overlapping reads in a single run. This technique is
much faster and cheaper than the existing state of the art sequencing technique
such as Sanger. However, the reads generated by pyrosequencing are short in
size and contain numerous errors. Furthermore, each read has a specific
position in the reference genome. In order to use these reads for any
subsequent analysis, the reads must be aligned . Existing multiple sequence
alignment methods cannot be used as they do not take into account the specific
positions of the sequences with respect to the genome, and are highly
inefficient for large number of sequences. Therefore, the common practice has
been to use either simple pairwise alignment despite its poor accuracy for
error prone pyroreads, or use computationally expensive techniques based on
sequential gap propagation. In this paper, we develop a computationally
efficient method based on domain decomposition, referred to as pyro-align, to
align such large number of reads. The proposed alignment algorithm accurately
aligns the erroneous reads in a short period of time, which is orders of
magnitude faster than any existing method. The accuracy of the alignment is
confirmed from the consensus obtained from the multiple alignments.

the particle size spectra of such system exhibit transition to dynamic scaling

(FDPC) Y = H(X + S)+Z, a more general version of Costa's channel, is studied
for the case in which there is partial and perfect knowledge of the fading
process H at the transmitter (CSIT) and the receiver (CSIR), respectively. A
key step in this problem is to determine the optimal inflation factor (under
Costa's choice of auxiliary random variable) when there is only partial CSIT.
Towards this end, two iterative numerical algorithms are proposed. Both of
these algorithms are seen to yield a good choice for the inflation factor.
Finally, the high-SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) behavior of the achievable rate
over the FDPC is dealt with. It is proved that FDPC (with t transmit and r
receive antennas) achieves the largest possible scaling factor of min(t,r) log
SNR even with no CSIT. Furthermore, in the high SNR regime, the optimality of
Costa's choice of auxiliary random variable is established even when there is
partial (or no) CSIT in the special case of FDPC with t <= r. Using the
high-SNR scaling-law result of the FDPC (mentioned before), it is shown that a
DPC-based multi-user transmission strategy, unlike other beamforming-based
multi-user strategies, can achieve a single-user sum-rate scaling factor over
the multiple-input multiple-output Gaussian Broadcast Channel with partial (or

small, 3) in slow-fading, it is adequate to send feedback bits only

Freidlin and Wentzell [Random Perturbations of Dynamical Systems, 2nd ed.
Springer, New York (1998)] and [Mem. Amer. Math. Soc. 109 (1994)] that if the
stream function of the flow is periodic, then the corresponding process on the
graph weakly converges to a Markov process. We consider the situation where the
stream function is not periodic, and the flow (when considered on the torus)
has an ergodic component of positive measure. We show that if the rotation
number is Diophantine, then the process on the graph still converges to a
Markov process, which spends a positive proportion of time in the vertex
corresponding to the ergodic component of the flow.

in turn allow us to compute a system of multiplication matrices

using Macaulay type resultant matrices of $f_1,...,f_s$ and a polynomial $J$ to

$J$ is a polynomial generalizing the Jacobian. We prove bounds on the degrees
needed for the Macaulay matrix in the case when $\I$ has finitely many

work only for the case where $\A$ is Gorenstein to the non-Gorenstein case. The
second proposed method uses Bezoutian matrices to compute matrices of traces of

coarser grids and in obtaining improved solution fidelity of near-wall
turbulent fluctuations. The subgrid scale turbulence effects are represented by
the standard Smagorinsky eddy-viscosity model, which is modified by using the
van Driest wall-damping function for near wall effects. For simulation of a
wider class of problems, we introduce general forcing terms in the natural
moment space of the GLBE. Expressions for the strain rate tensor used in the
SGS model are derived in terms of the non-equilibrium moments of the GLBE to
include such forcing terms. Variable resolutions are introduced into this
extended GLBE framework through a conservative multiblock approach. The
approach is assessed for two canonical flow problems bounded by walls, viz.,
fully-developed turbulent channel flow at a shear or friction Reynolds number
($\mathrm{Re}$) of 183.6 based on the channel half-width and three-dimensional
(3D) shear-driven flows in a cubical cavity at a $\mathrm{Re}$ of 12,000 based
on the side length of the cavity. Comparisons of detailed computed near-wall

problem of a directed polymer on the Cayley tree in the presence of random
energies along the left-most bonds. In the pure case, there exists a
first-order transition between a localized phase and a delocalized phase, with
a correlation length exponent $\nu_{pure}=1$. In the disordered case, we find
that the transition remains first-order, but that there exists two diverging
length scales in the critical region : the typical correlation length diverges
with the exponent $\nu_{typ}=1$, whereas the averaged correlation length
diverges with the bigger exponent $\nu_{av}=2$ and governs the finite-size
scaling properties. We describe the relations with previously studied models
that are governed by the same ""Infinite Disorder Fixed Point"". For the present
model, where the order parameter is the contact density $\theta_L=l_a/L$
(defined as the ratio of the number $l_a$ of contacts over the total length
$L$), the notion of ""infinite disorder fixed point"" means that the thermal
fluctuations of $\theta_L$ within a given sample, become negligeable at large
scale with respect to sample-to-sample fluctuations. We characterize the
statistics over the samples of the free-energy and of the contact density. In

transverse-momentum $Q_T$ of the produced lepton pair is small, and reproduces
the (fixed-order) next-to-leading QCD corrections upon integrating over $Q_T$.
The resummation corrections in $p\bar{p}$-collision behave differently compared

experiments (Czaplewski {\sl et al.}, 2002) show that the presence of large
aromatic molecules (toluene) block the diffusion of light hydrocarbon molecules
(propane) inside the narrow pore of a zeolite sample. As a result, the
desorption temperature of propane is significantly higher in the binary mixture
than in the single component case. In order to obtain further insight into
these results, we use a simple lattice gas model of diffusion of hard-core
particles to describe the diffusive transport of two species of molecules in a
one-dimensional zeolite channel. Our dynamical Monte Carlo simulations show
that taking into account an Arrhenius dependence of the single molecule
diffusion coefficient on temperature, one can explain many significant features
of the temperature programmed desorption profile observed in experiments.
However, on a closer comparison of the experimental curve and our simulation
data, we find that it is not possible to reproduce the higher propane current
than toluene current near the desorption peak seen in experiment. We argue that
this is caused by a violation of strict single-file behavior.

non-cluster fields. Analysis of the number and flux of these sources, using a
detailed pipeline to predict the distribution of non-cluster sources in each
field, reveals an excess of X-ray point sources associated with the galaxy
clusters. A sample of 148 galaxy clusters at 0.1<z<0.9, with no other nearby
clusters, show an excess of 230 cluster sources in total, an average of ~1.5
sources per cluster. The lack of optical data for these clusters limits the
physical interpretation of this result, as we cannot calculate the fraction of
cluster galaxies hosting X-ray sources. However, the fluxes of the excess
sources indicate that over half of them are very likely to be AGN, and the
radial distribution shows that they are quite evenly distributed over the
central 1 Mpc of the cluster, with almost no sources found beyond this radius.
We also use this pipeline to successfully reproduce the results of previous
studies, particularly the higher density of sources in the central 0.5 Mpc of a
few cluster fields, but show that these conclusions are not generally valid for
this larger sample of clusters. We conclude that some of these differences may
be due to the sample properties, such as the size and redshift of the clusters
studied, or a lack of publications for cluster fields with no excess sources.
This paper also presents the basic X-ray properties of the galaxy clusters, and
in subsequent papers in this series the dependence of the AGN population on
these cluster properties will be evaluated.

this ring required a generator of degree $m(p-1)$, thus demonstrating that the
result of Noether in characteristic 0 (that the ring of invariants of a finite
group is always generated in degrees less than or equal to the order of the
group) does not extend to the modular case. He also conjectured that a certain
set of invariants was a generating set with a proof in the case $p=2$. This
conjecture was proved by Campbell and Hughes in \cite{campbell-hughes}. Later,
Shank and Wehlau in \cite{cmipg} determined which elements in Richman's
generating set were redundant thereby producing a minimal generating set.
  We give a new proof of the result of Campbell and Hughes, Shank and Wehlau
giving a minimal algebra generating set for the ring of invariants ${\bf{F}}[m

generating set is also a SAGBI basis for ${\bf{F}}[m V_2]^{C_p}$. Further, our
techniques also serve to give an explicit decomposition of ${\bf{F}}[m V_2]$
into a direct sum of indecomposable $C_p$-modules. Finally, noting that our
representation of $C_p$ on $V_2$ is as the $p$-Sylow subgroup of $SL_2({\bf

primary variables), secondary variables are also considered that are correlated

models: The case $\omega=-1$ corresponds to the strong disorder renormalisation

dynamic increase of non-thermal line broadening of multiple emission lines as
the CME is released and the corona opens; reaching levels seen in coronal
holes. As the corona begins to close, refill and brighten, we see a reduction
of the non-thermal broadening towards the pre-eruption level. The dynamic
evolution of non-thermal broadening is consistent with the expected change of
Alfven wave amplitudes in the magnetically open rarefied dimming region,
compared to the dense closed corona prior to the CME. The presented data
reinforce the belief that coronal dimmings must be temporary sources of the
fast solar wind. It is unclear if such a rapid transition in the thermodynamics
of the corona to a solar wind state has an effect on the CME itself.

of perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD). In such processes, pQCD not only
predicts the hard reaction itself, but also the subsequent evolution in terms
of parton branching and radiation, leading to a parton shower and ultimately to
an observable jet of hadrons. If the hard process occurs in a heavy-ion
collision, a large part of this evolution takes place in the soft medium
created along with the hard reaction. An observation of jets in heavy-ion
collision thus allows a study of medium-modified QCD shower evolution. In
vacuum, Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations are well established tools to describe
such showers. For jet studies in heavy-ion collisions, MC models for in-medium
showers are currently being developed. However, the shower-medium interaction
depends on the nature of the microscopic degrees of freedom of the medium
created in a heavy-ion collision which is the very object one would like to
investigate. This paper presents a study in comparison between three different
possible implementations for the shower-medium interaction, two of them based
on medium-induced pQCD radiation, one of them a medium-induced drag force, and
shows for which observables differences between the three scenarios become
visible. We find that while single hadron observables such as R_AA are
incapable of differentiating between the scenarios, jet observables such as the
longiudinal momentum spectrum of hadrons in the jet show the potential to do
so.

described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD), are generated at the interaction
point. If one represents these fields in terms of partons (quarks and gluons),
the average number densities of the latter saturate at ultrahigh energies. At
that point, nonlinear effects become predominant in the dynamical equations.
The hadronic states that one gets in this regime of QCD are generically called
``color glass condensates''.
  Our understanding of scattering in QCD has benefited from recent progress in
statistical and mathematical physics. The evolution of hadronic scattering
amplitudes at fixed impact parameter in the regime where nonlinear parton
saturation effects become sizable was shown to be similar to the time evolution
of a system of classical particles undergoing reaction-diffusion processes. The
dynamics of such a system is essentially governed by equations in the
universality class of the stochastic Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piscounov
equation, which is a stochastic nonlinear partial differential equation.
Realizations of that kind of equations (that is, ``events'' in a particle
physics language) have the form of noisy traveling waves. Universal properties
of the latter can be taken over to scattering amplitudes in QCD.

physics useful in QCD, and summarizes the correspondence between these two

three-dimensional photon emission and orbits to allow for arbitrary latitudes
in the positions of the distant observers and the X-ray sources in place of the
mainly equatorial positions and photon orbits of the earlier consideration.
Following the trajectories of a large number of photons we calculate the
response functions of a given geometry and use them to produce model light
curves which we subsequently analyze to compute their power spectra and
autocorrelation functions. In the case of an optically-thin environment,
relevant to advection-dominated accretion flows, we consistently find QPOs at
frequencies of order of ~kHz for stellar-mass black hole candidates while order
of ~mHz for typical active galactic nuclei (~10^7 Msun) for a wide range of
viewing angles (30 to 80deg) from X-ray sources predominantly concentrated
toward the equator within the ergosphere. As in our previous treatment, here
too, the QPO signal is produced by the frame-dragging of the photons by the
rapidly-rotating black hole, which results in photon ""bunches"" separated by
constant time-lags, the result of multiple photon orbits around the hole. Our
model predicts for various source/observer configurations the robust presence
of a new class of QPOs, which is inevitably generic to curved spacetime

generally nonlinear functions of a generally continuous set of spectral

non unique, the non unicity allowing further optimization for given criteria.
The mathematical problem of tomography is thus the classification of all such
operator expansions for given (suitably closed) linear spaces of unbounded

problem is a difficult one, and remains still open, involving the theory of
general basis in Banach spaces, a still unfinished chapter of analysis. In this
paper we present new nontrivial operator expansions for the quorum of
quadratures of the harmonic oscillator, and introduce a first very preliminary
general framework to generate new expansions based on the Kolmogorov

for the solution of the general problem of quantum tomography in infinite
dimensions, which corresponds to provide a coherent mathematical framework for
operator expansions over functions of a continuous set of spectral densities.

representing dynamical units which interact through the network's links. Gene
regulatory networks, responsible for the production of proteins inside a cell,
are an example of system that can be described as a network of interacting
genes. The behavior of a complex dynamical system is characterized by
cooperativity of its units at various scales, leading to emergent dynamics
which is related to the system's function. Among the key problems concerning
complex systems is the issue of stability of their functioning, in relation to
different internal and external interaction parameters.
  In this Thesis we study two-dimensional chaotic maps coupled through
non-directed networks with different topologies. We use a non-symplectic
coupling which involves a time delay in the interaction among the maps. We test
the stability of network topologies through investigation of their collective
motion, done by analyzing the departures from chaotic nature of the isolated
units. The study is done on two network scales: (a) full-size networks (a
computer generated scalefree tree and a tree with addition of cliques); (b)
tree's characteristic sub-graph 4-star, as a tree's typical dynamical motif
which captures its topology in smallest possible number of nodes and is
suitable for time-delayed interaction. We study the dynamical relationship
between these two network structures, examining the emergence of cooperativity
on a large scale (trees) as a consequence of mesoscale dynamical patterns
exhibited by the 4-star. (FULL ABSTRACT INSIDE THE TEXT)

that these logarithmic terms make both sets of Virasoro generators non-zero

one-dimensional structural profile constructed as a linear combination of the
eigenvectors of the contact map of the target structure. The structural profile
is used to bias a search of the conformational space towards the target
structure in a Monte Carlo scheme operating on a C_alpha-chain of uniform,
finite thickness. Structure information thus enters the folding dynamics via
the effective connectivity, but the interaction is not restricted to pairs of
amino acids that form native contacts, resulting in a free energy landscape
which does not rely on the assumption of minimal frustration. Moreover,
effective connectivity vectors can be predicted more readily from the amino
acid sequence of proteins than the corresponding contact maps, thus suggesting
that the stochastic protocol presented here could be effectively combined with
other current methods for predicting native structures.

formation in protoplanetary disks. In spite that the electric charging of dust
particles is well recognized in some contexts, it has been largely ignored in
the current modeling of dust coagulation. In this study, we present a general
analysis of the dust charge state in protoplanetary disks, and then demonstrate
how the electric charging could dramatically change the currently accepted
scenario of dust coagulation. First, we describe a new semianalytical method to
calculate the dust charge state and gas ionization state self-consistently.
This method is far more efficient than previous numerical methods, and provides
a general and clear description of the charge state of gas-dust mixture.
Second, we apply this analysis to early evolutionary stages where the dust has
been thought to grow into fractal ($D \sim 2$) aggregates with a
quasi-monodisperse (i.e., narrow) size distribution. We find that, for a wide
range of model parameters, the fractal growth is strongly inhibited by the
electric repulsion between colliding aggregates and eventually ""freezes out"" on
its way to the subsequent growth stage involving collisional compression.
Strong disk turbulence would help the aggregates to overcome this growth
barrier, but then it would cause catastrophic collisional fragmentation in
later growth stages. These facts suggest that the combination of electric
repulsion and collisional fragmentation would impose a serious limitation on
dust growth in protoplanetary disks. We propose a possible scenario of dust
evolution after the freeze-out. Finally, we point out that the fractal growth
of dust aggregates tends to maintain a low ionization degree and, as a result,
a large magnetorotationally stable region in the disk.
