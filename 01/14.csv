possible field-theoretical interpretation as classical solutions is an
important open question. For the system at hand, we propose that it corresponds
to the point-like limit of the eight-dimensional so-called SO(8) instanton
solution. This configuration is a solution of the quartic term of the
non-abelian D7 action, i.e., the term which stays finite in the limit in which
alpha' goes to zero with the string coupling fixed that preserves the D(-1)
effects. As a necessary consistency condition, we check that the next order
term in the non-abelian effective action vanishes on the SO(8) solution so that
the limit we take is well-defined.

of heterotic string theory. The Kerr/CFT correspondence states that the
near-horizon states of an extremal four (or higher) dimensional black hole
could be identified with a certain chiral conformal field theory under the
conjecture that the central charges from the non-gravitational fields vanish.
The corresponding Virasoro algebra is generated by a class of diffeomorphisms
which preserves the appropriate boundary conditions on the near-horizon
geometry. To understand the chiral conformal field theory, we consider the
class of extremal Kerr-Sen black hole (that contains three non-gravitational
fields) as a class of solutions in the low energy limit (effective field
theory) of heterotic string theory. We derive the expression of the conserved
charges for the extremal Kerr-Sen solutions that contain dilaton, abelian gauge
filed and antisymmetric tensor filed. We confirm and extend the validity of the
conjecture (that the central charges from the non-gravitational fields vanish)
for theories including antisymmetric tensor fields. We combine the calculated
central charges with the expected form of the temperature using the Cardy
formula to obtain the entropy of the extremal black hole microscopically; in
agreement with the macroscopic Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the extremal black
hole.

laser-cooling technique [I.S. Averbukh and Y. Prior, Phys. Rev. Lett. 94,
153002 (2005)]. The improved technique results in an increased cooling rate and
decreases the minimum cooling temperature achievable with the optical shaker.
The modified shaker requires only one measurement of the force on the atoms
before each cooling step, resulting in a simplification of the feedback
electronics. The force is inferred from the power variations of the transmitted
laser beams and is used to determine the best moment at which the cooling steps
are applied. The temperature of the atomic system is automatically monitored,
which allows maintaining an optimum cooling rate as the temperature decreases.
The improved shaker is simple to build, provides a faster rate of cooling, and
can work in the microkelvin regime. Numerical modeling shows a reduction by a
factor of three in the required number of phase jumps and a lower temperature
limit reduced by an order of magnitude compared to the initially proposed
shaker. The technique is also extendable to cooling in three dimensions.

argue that indirect detection through neutrinos is challenging but not
altogether excluded. For middle masses, we try to make the most benefit of the
proximity of the so-called 'iron resonance' that might enhance the capture of
the dark matter candidate by the Earth. The signal from the Earth is further
enhanced if light right-handed Majorana neutrinos are introduced, in which case
the scalar dark matter candidate may annihilate into pairs of mono-energetic
neutrinos. In the case of high masses, detection of neutrinos from the Galactic
centre might be possible, provided the dark matter abundance is substantially
boosted.

Finite size corrections can be introduced, although in an approximate way, to
correct for the dependence of the free energy on the size of the system. The
computation of free energies of solid phases can be extended to molecular
fluids. The procedure to compute free energies of solid phases of water (ices

energy calculations agree within statistical uncertainty. Phase diagram
calculations can help to improve potential models of molecular fluids; for
water, the TIP4P/2005 model can be regarded as an improved version of TIP4P. We
will also review some recent work on the phase diagram of the simplest ionic

ionic liquids, the model is becoming quite popular to describe charged
colloids. Besides the possibility of obtaining fluid-solid equilibria for
simple protein models will be discussed. In these primitive models, the protein

studied by computer simulation by using the TIP4P/2005 model of water. Free
energy calculations were performed for ices VII and VIII and for the fluid
phase to determine the melting curve of these ices. In addition molecular
dynamics simulations were performed at high temperatures (440K) observing the
spontaneous freezing of the liquid into a solid phase at pressures of about
80000 bar. The analysis of the structure obtained lead to the conclusion that a
plastic crystal phase was formed. In the plastic crystal phase the oxygen atoms
were arranged forming a body center cubic structure, as in ice VII, but the
water molecules were able to rotate almost freely. Free energy calculations
were performed for this new phase, and it was found that for TIP4P/2005 this
plastic crystal phase is thermodynamically stable with respect to ices VII and
VIII for temperatures higher than about 400K, although the precise value
depends on the pressure. By using Gibbs Duhem simulations, all coexistence
lines were determined, and the phase diagram of the TIP4P/2005 model was
obtained, including ices VIII and VII and the new plastic crystal phase. The
TIP4P/2005 model is able to describe qualitatively the phase diagram of water.
It would be of interest to study if such a plastic crystal phase does indeed
exist for real water. The nearly spherical shape of water makes possible the
formation of a plastic crystal phase at high temperatures. The formation of a
plastic crystal phase at high temperatures (with a bcc arrangements of oxygen
atoms) is fast from a kinetic point of view occurring in about 2ns. This is in
contrast to the nucleation of ice Ih which requires simulations of the order of
hundreds of ns.

increasing the magnetic field, applied parallel to the axis of the sample, from
zero until the first vortex is created. A further increase of the field pulls
the vortex in, until it reaches the antidot. As the polarity of the field is
reversed, an antivortex enters the scene, travels toward the center of the

its temperature, and Ginzburg-Landau parameter, the vortex-antivortex encounter
takes place at the antidot or at the superconducting sea around it. The

the effective temperature and the surface carbon abundance in DQs should be
expected, with the largest carbon abundances expected in the hottest DQs. From

smaller than those predicted by the standard theory of stellar evolution. At

result of tidal interactions with the Sun combined with planetary

core, which should induce a contribution of viscous friction at the core-mantle
boundary to the spin evolution. This last effect greatly increases the chances
of capture in all spin-orbit resonances, being 100% for the 2/1 resonance, and
thus preventing the planet from evolving to the presently observed

evolution of Mercury's orbit can drive its eccentricity to very low values

the eccentricity becomes lower than a critical value. In our numerical

log(deg f), i.e., polynomial in the size of the lacunary representation, and it
works over GF(q)[x] (for large characteristic) as well as Q[x]. We also give
two deterministic algorithms to compute the perfect root h given f and r. The
first is output-sensitive (based on the sparsity of h) and works only over
Q[x]. A sparsity-sensitive Newton iteration forms the basis for the second
approach to computing h, which is extremely efficient and works over both
GF(q)[x] (for large characteristic) and Q[x], but depends on a number-theoretic
conjecture. Work of Erdos, Schinzel, Zannier, and others suggests that both of
these algorithms are unconditionally polynomial-time in the lacunary size of
the input polynomial f. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency of the
randomized detection algorithm and the latter perfect root computation
algorithm with an implementation in the C++ library NTL.

to build an approximately n x n square using tile concentration programming,
and asked whether the approximation could be made exact with high probability.
We show how this technique can be modified to answer another question of Kao

programmed through tile concentrations to assemble arbitrary finite *scaled

of points, for some integer c. Furthermore, we exhibit a smooth tradeoff
between specifying bits of n via tile concentrations versus specifying them via
hard-coded tile types, which allows tile concentration programming to be
employed for specifying a fraction of the bits of ""input"" to a tile assembly
system, under the constraint that concentrations can only be specified to a
limited precision. Finally, to account for some unrealistic aspects of the tile
concentration programming model, we show how to modify the construction to use
only concentrations that are arbitrarily close to uniform.

mechanism by which polypeptide chains aggregate by forming metastable
oligomeric intermediate states prior to converting into fibrillar structures.
Our results illustrate how the formation of ordered arrays of hydrogen bonds
drives the formation of beta-sheets within the disordered oligomeric aggregates
that form early under the effect of hydrophobic forces. Initially individual
beta-sheets form with random orientations, which subsequently tend to align
into protofilaments as their lengths increases. Our results suggest that
amyloid aggregation represents an example of the Ostwald step rule of first
order phase transitions by showing that ordered cross-beta structures emerge
preferentially from disordered compact dynamical intermediate assemblies.

some subtle issues concerning the calculation of the free energy of molecular
solids. First, for solids with non-cubic symmetry, we have studied the effect
of the shape of the simulation box on the free energy. Our results show that
the equilibrium shape of the simulation box must be used to compute the free
energy in order to avoid the appearance of artificial stress in the system that
will result in an increase of the free energy. In complex solids, such as the
solid phases of water, another difficulty is related to the choice of the
reference structure. As in some cases there is not an obvious orientation of
the molecules, it is not clear how to generate the reference structure. Our
results will show that,as long as the structure is not too far from the
equilibrium structure,the calculated free energy is invariant to the reference
structure used in the free energy calculations. Finally, the strong size
dependence of the free energy of solids is also studied.

circumstellar habitable zones (HZs) of dM stars are located within ~0.05-0.4 AU
of the host star. Nevertheless, the prospect of life on a planet located within
the HZ of a red dwarf is moderately high, based on the longevity of these stars
(>50 Gyr), their constant luminosities and high space densities. Here we
describe the aims and early results of the ""Living with a Red Dwarf"" Program -
a study of dM stars that we have been carrying out over the last few years. The
primary focus of our research on dM stars is the study of their magnetic
dynamos and resulting star spots & coronal X-ray and chromospheric UV emissions
as a function of age, rotation and spectral type. This program will provide
datasets that can be used as inputs for the study of all aspects of dM stars,
along with the planets already discovered hosted by them and the probable
hundreds (thousands?) of planets expected to be uncovered in the near future by
missions such as Kepler & Darwin/TPF. These datasets will be invaluable to
those who model exo-planetary atmospheres, as well as exobiologists &
astrobiologists who are studying the possibilities of life elsewhere in the
universe. A significant element of our program is the determination of accurate
stellar magnetic-driven X-ray-UV (X-UV) irradiances that are generated by the
dM stars' vigorous magnetic dynamos. These X-UV irradiances (and flare
frequencies) are strongly dependent on rotation, and thus age, and diminish as
the stars lose angular momentum and spin-down over time via magnetic braking.

achieve both high spectral efficiencies (same spectral efficiency as in V-BLAST

been a challenge. In this paper, we present a probabilistic data association
(PDA) based algorithm for decoding non-orthogonal STBCs with large dimensions.
Our simulation results show that the proposed PDA-based algorithm achieves near
SISO AWGN uncoded BER as well as near-capacity coded BER (within about 5 dB of
the theoretical capacity) for large non-orthogonal STBCs from CDA. We study the
effect of spatial correlation on the BER, and show that the performance loss
due to spatial correlation can be alleviated by providing more receive spatial
dimensions. We report good BER performance when a training-based iterative
decoding/channel estimation is used (instead of assuming perfect channel
knowledge) in channels with large coherence times. A comparison of the
performances of the PDA algorithm and the likelihood ascent search (LAS)
algorithm (reported in our recent work) is also presented.

arguably one of the most interesting parts of the planet spectrum (from 1 to 3
um) is inaccessible with this satellite. This region is at the peak of the
planet's spectral energy distribution and is also the regime where molecular
absorption bands can significantly influence the measured emission.
  Aims: So far, 2.2 um K-band secondary eclipse measurements, which are
possible from the ground, have not yet lead to secure detections. The aim of
this paper is to measure the secondary eclipse of the very hot Jupiter TrES-3b
in K-band, and in addition to observe its transit, to obtain an accurate planet
radius in the near infrared.
  Methods: We have used the William Herschell Telescope (WHT) to observe the
secondary eclipse, and the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) to observe
the transit of TrES-3b. Both observations involved significant defocusing of
the telescope, aimed to produce high-cadence time series of several thousand
frames at high efficiency, with the starlight spread out over many pixels.
  Results: We detect the secondary eclipse of TrES-3b with a depth of
-0.241+-0.043% (~6 sigma). This corresponds to a day-side brightness
temperature of T_B(2.2um)= 2040+-185 K, which is consistent with current models
of the physical properties of this planet's upper atmosphere. The centre of the
eclipse seems slightly offset from phase phi=0.5 by Delta_phi=-0.0042+-0.0027,
which could indicate that the orbit of TrES-3b is non-circular [abridged].

collapsed into a single object earlier than surviving satellites. BBs start to
form stars earlier, during the peak of the merger activity in LCDM, and
build-up half of their final stellar mass (measured at the moment of

satellites keep increasing their stellar masses rather quiescently down to z~1.

post-processing we investigate what kinds of feedback would be required to
reproduce observed galaxy masses and star formation rates. To mimic an extreme
form of ""preventive"" feedback (e.g., AGN radio mode) we remove all baryonic
mass that was originally accreted via ""hot mode"" from shock-heated gas. This
does not bring the high mass end of the galaxy mass function into agreement
with observations because much of the stellar mass in these systems formed at
high redshift from baryons that originally accreted via ""cold mode"" onto lower
mass progenitors. An efficient ""ejective"" feedback mechanism, such as supernova
driven winds, must reduce the masses of these progenitors. Feedback must also
reduce the masses of lower mass z=0 galaxies, which assemble at lower redshifts
and have much lower star formation rates. If we monotonically re-map galaxy
masses to reproduce the observed mass function, but retain the simulation's
predicted star formation rates, we obtain fairly good agreement with the
observed sequence of star-forming galaxies but fail to recover the observed
population of passive, low star formation rate galaxies. Suppressing all hot
mode accretion improves agreement for high mass galaxies but worsens the
agreement at intermediate masses. Reproducing these z=0 observations requires a
feedback mechanism that dramatically suppresses star formation in a fraction of
galaxies, increasing with mass, while leaving star formation rates of other
galaxies essentially unchanged.

blue-ward of the 6.4 keV line due to ionized material. This emission is well
reproduced by a broad line produced in the accretion disc, while it cannot be
easily described by scattering or emission from photo-ionized gas at rest. The
summed spectrum of all XMM-Newton observations shows the presence of a narrow
absorption line at 7.3 keV produced by highly ionized outflowing material. A
spectral variability study of the XMM-Newton data shows an indication for an
excess of variability at 6.6-6.7 keV. These variations may be produced in the

affects the temperature distribution of the intergalactic medium (IGM). During
this process, the residual energy of each ionizing photon is deposited in the
IGM as heat, increasing its temperature to 20,000-30,000 K; subsequent
expansion of the Universe then cools the gas. Because reionization most likely
proceeds from high to low densities, underdense voids are ionized last, have
less time to cool, and are (on average) warmer than mean-density gas
immediately after reionization is complete (an ""inverted"" equation of state).
  From this initial configuration, the low-density gas cools quickly and
eventually returns to a more normal equation of state. The rapidly evolving
temperature introduces systematic uncertainties in measurements of the ionizing
background at z~6. For example, late reionization implies rapid cooling, so
that the ionizing background would have to evolve even more rapidly at z ~5-6
than typically claimed. This degeneracy is difficult to disentangle, because
the Lyman-alpha forest probes only a narrow range in densities (over which the
gas is nearly isothermal). However, higher Lyman-series transitions probe wider
density ranges, sampling different effective temperatures, and offer a new way
to measure the IGM equation of state that should work where nearly saturated
absorption precludes other methods. This will help to separate evolution in
temperature from that in the ionizing background. While more detailed study
with hydrodynamic simulations is needed, we show that such measurements could
potentially distinguish early and late reionization using only a handful of
lines of sight.

Rather than the locality of the metric operator obtained, the ansatz enables
one to calculate the metric operator just once for all dimensions of the
space-time. We calculated the metric operator of the $i\phi^{3}$ scalar field
theory up to first order in the coupling. The higher orders can be conjectured
from their corresponding operators in the quantum mechanical case available in
the literature. We assert that, the calculations existing in literature for the
metric operator in field theory are cumbersome and are done case by case
concerning the dimension of space-time in which the theory is investigated.
Moreover, while the resulted metric operator in this work is local, the
existing calculations for the metric operator leads to a non-local one. Indeed,
we expect that the new results introduced in this work will greatly lead to the
progress of the studies in Pseudo-Hermitian field theories where there exist a
lack of such kind of studies in the literature. In fact, with the aid of this
work a rigorous study of a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Higgs mechanism can be
reached.

of new classes of nanodevices and structures. At the atomic scale of novel
nanostructured semiconductors the distinction between new device and new
material is blurred and device physics and material science meet. The quantum
mechanical effects in the electronic states of the device and the granular,
atomistic representation of the underlying material become important. The
variety of geometries, materials, and doping configurations in semiconductor
devices at the nanoscale suggests that a general nanoelectronic modeling tool
is needed. The Nanoelectronic Modeling tool (NEMO 3-D) has been developed to
address these needs. Based on the atomistic valence-force field (VFF) method
and a variety of nearest-neighbor tight-binding models, NEMO 3-D enables the
computation of strain for over 64 million atoms and of electronic structure for
over 52 million atoms, corresponding to volumes of (110nmx110nmx110nm) and
(101nmx101nmx101nm), respectively. This article discusses the theoretical
models, essential algorithmic and computational components, and optimization
methods that have been used in the development and the deployment of NEMO 3-D.
Also, successful applications of NEMO 3-D are demonstrated in the atomistic
calculation of single-particle electronic states of (1) self-assembled quantum
dots including long-range strain and piezoelectricity; (2) stacked quantum dots
; (3) Phosphorus impurities in Silicon used in quantum computation; (4) Si on
SiGe quantum wells (QWs); and (5) SiGe nanowires.

proposed region includes the Cover-Leung rate region [1], and it is shown that
the inclusion is strict. The proof uses a block-Markov superposition strategy
based on the observation that the messages of the two users are correlated
given the feedback. The rates of transmission are too high for each encoder to
decode the other's message directly using the feedback, so they transmit
correlated information in the next block to learn the message of one another.
They then cooperate in the following block to resolve the residual uncertainty
of the decoder. The coding scheme may be viewed as a natural generalization of
the Cover-Leung scheme with a delay of one extra block and a pair of additional
auxiliary random variables. We compute the proposed rate region for two
different MACs and compare the results with other known rate regions for the
MAC with feedback. Finally, we show how the coding scheme can be extended to
obtain larger rate regions with more auxiliary random variables.

classes and sub types consisting of galaxies with bulges, intermediate types

also detected. The morphological separation is based on automated
classification criteria which resemble the bulge sizes and the flatness of the
disks. Each of these broad classes contains about 1/3 of the total sample.
Using strict criteria for selecting pure bulgeless galaxies leads to a fraction
of 15% of simple disk galaxies. We compare this fraction to other galaxy
catalogs and find an excellent agreement of the observed frequency of bulgeless
galaxies. Although the fraction of simple disk galaxies in this study does not
represent a cosmic fraction of bulgeless galaxies, it shows that the relative

value of the frequency of simple disks in the local Universe. This fraction of

redshift objects, the ""blue"" FUV-NUV color may be caused by enhanced Ly$\alpha$

Synthetic QSO templates constructed with Ly$\alpha$ up to 3 times stronger than
in standard templates match the observed UV colors of our low redshift sample.
The H$\alpha$ emission increases, and the optical spectra become bluer, with
increasing absolute UV luminosity. The UV-blue QSOs at redshift about 2, where
the GALEX bands sample restframe about 450-590A (FUV) and about 590-940A(NUV),
are fainter than the average of UV-normal QSOs at similar redshift in NUV,

that their observed FUV-NUV color may be explained by a combination of steep
flux rise towards short wavelengths and dust absorption below the Lyman limit,
such as from small grains or crystalline carbon. The ratio of Ly$\alpha$ to CIV
could be measured in 10 objects; it is higher (30% on average) than for

to obtain an improved prediction limit with better coverage properties. Kabaila
and Syuhada (2008) present a simulation-based approximation to this improved
prediction limit, which avoids the extensive algebraic manipulations required
for this modification. We present a modification of an estimative prediction
interval, analogous to the Barndorff-Nielsen and Cox modification, to obtain an
improved prediction interval with better coverage properties. We also present
an analogue, for the prediction interval context, of this simulation-based
approximation. The parameter estimator on which the estimative and improved
prediction limits and intervals are based is assumed to have the same
asymptotic distribution as the (conditional) maximum likelihood estimator. The
improved prediction limit and interval depend on the asymptotic conditional
bias of this estimator. This bias can be very sensitive to very small changes
in the estimator. It may require considerable effort to find this bias. We
show, however, that the improved prediction limit and interval have asymptotic
efficiencies that are functionally independent of this bias. Thus, improved
prediction limits and intervals obtained using the Barndorff-Nielsen and Cox
type of methodology can conveniently be based on the (conditional) maximum
likelihood estimator, whose asymptotic conditional bias is given by the formula
of Vidoni (2004, p.144). Also, improved prediction limits and intervals
obtained using Kabaila and Syuhada type approximations have asymptotic
efficiencies that are independent of the estimator on which these intervals are
based.

($h(t)$) which varies sinusoidally with time as $h = h_0\cos{\omega t}$, with
$|t| \leq t_f = \pi/\omega$. We also consider the situation where the magnetic
field consists of an oscillatory as well as a linearly varying component, i.e.,
$h(t) = h_0\cos{\omega t} + t/\tau$. Our purpose is to estimate the defect
density and the local entropy density in the final state if the system is
initially prepared in its ground state. For a single crossing through the
quantum critical point with $h = h_0\cos{\omega t}$, the density of defects in
the final state is calculated by mapping the dynamics to an equivalent Landau
Zener problem by linearizing near the crossing point, and is found to vary as
$\sqrt{\omega}$ in the limit of small $\omega$. On the other hand, the local
entropy density is found to attain a maximum as a function of $\omega$ near a
characteristic scale $\omega_0$. Extending to the situation of multiple
crossings, we show that the non-trivial interference effects of certain
resonance modes solely contribute to the production of defects. Kink density as
well as the diagonal entropy density show oscillatory dependence on the number
of full cycles of oscillation. Finally, the inclusion of a linear term in the
transverse field on top of the oscillatory component, results to a kink density
which decreases continuously with $\tau$ and $\omega$. The entropy density
shows monotonous growth with both $\tau$ and $\omega$, in sharp contrast to the
situations studied earlier. We do also propose appropriate scaling relations
for the defect density in above situations and compare the results with the
numerical results obtained by integrating the Schrodinger equations.

  Node Locations",,,,,"cs.IT cs.NI math.IT math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a lower bound on the capacity of wireless ad hoc erasure
networks is derived in closed form in the canonical case where $n$ nodes are
uniformly and independently distributed in the unit area square. The bound
holds almost surely and is asymptotically tight. We assume all nodes have fixed
transmit power and hence two nodes should be within a specified distance $r_n$
of each other to overcome noise. In this context, interference determines
outages, so we model each transmitter-receiver pair as an erasure channel with
a broadcast constraint, i.e. each node can transmit only one signal across all
its outgoing links. A lower bound of $\Theta(n r_n)$ for the capacity of this
class of networks is derived. If the broadcast constraint is relaxed and each
node can send distinct signals on distinct outgoing links, we show that the
gain is a function of $r_n$ and the link erasure probabilities, and is at most
a constant if the link erasure probabilities grow sufficiently large with $n$.
Finally, the case where the erasure probabilities are themselves random
variables, for example due to randomness in geometry or channels, is analyzed.
We prove somewhat surprisingly that in this setting, variability in erasure
probabilities increases network capacity.

the second-order derivative nature of the RT model and the inherited

straightforwardly. By using the Dirac canonical quantization method our
approach comprises the management of both first- and second-class constraints

the fundamental tradeoff between the communication reliability and transmission

deduced. We then put forth the notion of the bottleneck error exponent, which
is the worst exponent decay between the two links, to give us insight into the

present two optimal resource allocations to maximize the bottleneck error
exponent: i) the optimal rate allocation under a sum-rate constraint and its
closed-form quasi-optimal solution that requires only knowledge of the capacity

important factors which mostly have been ignored in the literature so far.
These include spin-dependent interfacial phase shifts (spin-DIPS) and
inhomogeneous textures of the magnetization in the ferromagnetic layer, both of
which are expected to be present in real experimental samples. Our approach is
numerical, allowing us to access the full proximity effect regime. In Part I of
this work, we study the superconducting proximity effect and the resulting
local density of states in an inhomogeneous ferromagnet with a non-trivial
magnetic texture.
  Our two main results in Part I are a study of how Bloch and N\'eel domain
walls affect the proximity-induced superconducting correlations and a study of
the superconducting proximity effect in a conical ferromagnet. The latter topic
should be relevant for the ferromagnet Ho, which was recently used in an
experiment to demonstrate the possibility to generate and sustain long-range
triplet superconducting correlations. In Part II of this work, we investigate
the inverse proximity effect with emphasis on the induced magnetization in the
superconducting region as a result of the ""leakage"" from the ferromagnetic
region. It is shown that the presence of spin-DIPS modify conclusions obtained
previously in the literature with regard to the induced magnetization in the
superconducting region. In particular, we find that the spin-DIPS can trigger
an anti-screening effect of the magnetization, leading to an induced
magnetization in the superconducting region with \textit{the same sign} as in
the proximity ferromagnet.

fourth-family quarks and leptons, their low-energy effective descriptions may
involve multiple composite Higgs fields, leading to a possibility that the
electroweak phase transition at finite temperature is first order due to the
Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. We examine the behavior of the electroweak phase
transition based on the effective renormalizable Yukawa theory which consists
of the fourth-family quarks and two SU(2)-doublet Higgs fields corresponding to
the bilinear operators of the fourth-family quarks with/without imposing the
compositeness condition. The strength of the first-order phase transition is
estimated by using the finite-temperature effective potential at one-loop with
the ring-improvement. In the Yukawa theory without the compositeness condition,
it is found that there is a parameter region where the first-order phase
transition is strong enough for the electroweak baryogenesis with the
experimentally acceptable Higgs boson and fourth-family quark masses. On the
other hand, when the compositeness condition is imposed, the phase transition
turns out to be weakly first order, or possibly second order, although the
result is rather sensitive to the details of the compositeness condition.
Combining with the result of the Yukawa theory without the compositeness
condition, it is argued that with the fourth-family quark masses in the range
of 330-480 GeV, corresponding to the compositeness scale in the range of
1.0-2.3 TeV, the four-fermion interaction among the fourth-family quarks does
not lead to the strongly first-order electroweak phase transition.

galaxy, NGC7582. The source is characterized by very rapid (on timescales even
lower than a day) changes of the column density of an inner absorber, together
with the presence of constant components arising as reprocessing from a
Compton-thick material. The best fitting scenario implies important
modifications to the zeroth order view of Unified Models. While the existence
of a pc-scale torus is needed in order to produce a constant Compton reflection
component and an iron K$\alpha$ emission line, in this Seyfert 2 galaxy this is
not viewed along the line of sight. On the other hand, the absorption of the
primary continuum is due to another material, much closer to the BH, roughly at
the distance of the BLR, which can produce the observed rapid spectral
variability. On top of that, the constant presence of a $10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$
column density can be ascribed to the presence of a dust lane, extended on a
galactic scale, as previously confirmed by Chandra. There is now mounting
evidence that complexity in the obscuration of AGN may be the rule rather than
the exception. We therefore propose to modify the Unification Model, adding to
the torus the presence of two further absorbers/emitters. Their combination
along the line of sight can reproduce all the observed phenomenology.

infinite multiplicity embedded in its continuous spectrum. We perturb $H_0$ by
smooth scalar potentials $V=O((x_1,x_2)>^{-\de_\perp}x_3>^{-\de_\parallel})$,
$\de_\perp>2, \de_\parallel>1$. We assume also that $V$ and $v_0$ have an
analytic continuation, in the magnetic field direction, in a complex sector
outside a compact set. We define the resonances of $H=H_0+V$ as the eigenvalues
of the non-selfadjoint operator obtained from $H$ by analytic distortions of
$\R_{x_3}$. We study their distribution near any fixed real eigenvalue of
$H_0$, $2bq+\la$ for $q\in\N$. In a ring centered at $2bq+\la$ with radiuses
$(r,2r)$, we establish an upper bound, as $r$ tends to 0, of the number of
resonances. This upper bound depends on the decay of $V$ at infinity only in
the directions $(x_1,x_2)$. Finally, we deduce a representation of the
derivative of the spectral shift function (SSF) for the operator pair ($H_0,H$)

variations on small physical scales. We have applied a new variable nIR colour
excess method, V-NICE, to measure the extinction; this method allows for
variation in both the extinction law parameter alpha and the degree of absolute
extinction on very small physical scales. We see significant variation in both
these parameters on scales of 5 arcsec. In our observed fields, representing a
random sample of sight lines to the NB, we measure alpha to be 2.64 +- 0.52,
compared to the canonical ""universal"" value of 2. Our measured levels of A_Ks
are similar to previously measured results (1 < A_Ks < 4.5); however, the
steeper extinction law results in higher values for A_J (4.5 < A_J < 10) and
A_H (1.5 < A_H < 6.5). Only when the extinction law is allowed to vary on the
smallest scales can we recover self-consistent measures of the absolute
extinction at each wavelength, allowing accurate reddening corrections for
field star photometry in the NB. The steeper extinction law slope also suggests
that previous conversions of nIR extinction to A_V may need to be reconsidered.
Finally, we find that the measured values of extinction are significantly
dependent on the filter transmission functions of the instrument used to obtain
the data. This effect must be taken into account when combining or comparing
data from different instruments.

known as a highly challenging problem. The author determined the rate
distortion region in the case where the $L$ sources working as partial side

condition. In this paper we extend the author's previous result to the case
where $L+1$ sources satisfy a kind of tree structure on their correlation. We
call this tree structure of information sources the TS condition, which
contains the CI condition as a special case. In this paper we derive an
explicit outer bound of the rate distortion region when information sources
satisfy the TS condition. We further derive an explicit sufficient condtion for
this outer bound to be tight. In particular, we determine the sum rate part of
the rate distortion region for the case where information sources satisfy the

derive an explicit recursive formula of this sum rate part.

Eps Indi Ba and Bb forming the tightly bound binary Eps Indi B, which orbits

resolution spectra of Eps Indi B in the J, H and K near-infrared bands. The
spectral types of Eps Indi Ba and Bb are determined by direct comparison of the
flux-calibrated JHK spectra with T dwarf standard template spectra and also by
NIR spectral indices. Eps Indi Bb is confirmed as a T6 while the spectral type
of Eps Indi Ba is T1.5 so somewhat later than the previously reported T1.
Constrained values for surface gravity and effective temperature are derived by
comparison with model spectra. The evolutionary models predict masses around
about 53 M_J for Eps Indi Ba and about 34 M_J for Eps Indi Bb, slightly higher
than previously reported values. The suppressed J-band and enhanced K-band flux

non- linear algorithm Aski is presented. Using the framework of Maximum A
Posteriori inversion, it aims at recovering the full-sky convergence map from
surveys with masks. It proceeds in two steps: CCD images of crowded galactic
fields are deblurred using automated edge-preserving deconvolution; once the
reduced shear is estimated, the convergence map is also inverted via an edge-
preserving method. For the deblurring, it is found that when the observed field
is crowded, this gain can be quite significant for realistic ground-based
surveys when both positivity and edge-preserving penalties are imposed during
the iterative deconvolution. For the convergence inversion, the quality of the
reconstruction is investigated on noisy maps derived from the horizon N-body
simulation, with and without Galactic cuts, and quantified using one-point
statistics, power spectra, cluster counts, peak patches and the skeleton. It is
found that the reconstruction is able to interpolate and extrapolate within the
Galactic cuts/non-uniform noise; its sharpness-preserving penalization avoids
strong biasing near the clusters of the map; it reconstructs well the shape of
the PDF as traced by its skewness and kurtosis; the geometry and topology of
the reconstructed map is close to the initial map as traced by the peak patch
distribution and the skeleton's differential length; the two-points statistics
of the recovered map is consistent with the corresponding smoothed version of
the initial map; the distribution of point sources is also consistent with the
corresponding smoothing, with a significant improvement when edge preserving
prior is applied. The contamination of B-modes when realistic Galactic cuts are
present is also investigated. Leakage mainly occurs on large scales.

electron gas which contains an insulating region comparable to the Fermi
wavelength. The insulating region causes the electron wave function to vanish
in that region. We describe the insulating region as a static vortex. The
vortex carries a flux which is determined by vanishing of the charge density of
the electronic fluid due to the insulating region. The sign of the vorticity
for a hole is opposite to the vorticity for adding additional electrons. The
vorticity gives rise to non-commuting kinetic momenta. The two dimensional
electron gas is described as fluid with a density which obeys the Fermi-Dirac
statistics. The presence of the confinement potential gives rise to vanishing
kinetic momenta in the vicinity of the classical turning points. As a result,
the Cartesian coordinate do not commute and gives rise to a Hall current which
in the presence of a modified Fermi-Surface caused by the microwave field
results in a rectified voltage. Using a Bosonized formulation of the two
dimensional gas in the presence of insulating regions allows us to compute the
rectified current. The proposed theory may explain the experimental results

et. al2006, Jorstad et al. 2007, D'Arcangelo et al. 2007) Our joint analysis of
optical and VLBA polarization data for a sample of about 40 AGNs shows that,
after correction for the inferred VLBA core Faraday rotations, most BL Lac
objects and some quasars have aligned VLBA-core and optical polarizations,
although many quasars also show no obvious relationship between their VLBA-core
and optical polarization angles. This may indicate that not all AGNs have
cospatial regions of optical and radio emission in their jets. However, another
possibility is that some of the 7mm-2cm VLBA cores have Faraday rotations of
the order of several tens of thousand of rad/m^2, which were not properly fit
by our three-frequency data due to n*pi ambiguities in the observed
polarization angles, leading to incorrect subtraction of the effects of the
core Faraday rotation, and so incorrect ""zero-wavelength"" radio polarization
angles. The possibility of such high core Faraday rotations is supported by the
results of the parsec-scale Faraday-rotation studies of Zavala & Taylor (2004)
and Jorstad et al. (2007).

superconductor/ferromagnetic/superconductor (S/FM/S) Josephson junction in
which the FM layer has a conical magnetic structure composed of an in-plane
rotating antiferromagnetic phase and an out-of-plane ferromagnetic component.
In view of the realistic electronic properties and magnetic structures that can
be formed when conical magnets such as Ho are grown with a polycrystalline
structure in thin-film form by methods such as direct current sputtering and
evaporation, we have modeled this situation in the dirty limit with a large
magnetic coherence length ($\xi_f$). This means that the electron mean free
path is much smaller than the normalized spiral length $\lambda/2\pi$ which in
turn is much smaller than $\xi_f$ (with $\lambda$ as the length a complete
spiral makes along the growth direction of the FM). In this physically
reasonable limit we have employed the linearized Usadel equations: we find that
the triplet correlations are short ranged and manifested in the critical
current as a rapid oscillation on the scale of $\lambda/2\pi$. These rapid
oscillations in the critical current are superimposed on a slower oscillation
which is related to the singlet correlations. Both oscillations decay on the
scale of $\xi_f$. We derive an analytical solution and also describe a
computational method for obtaining the critical current as a function of the
conical magnetic layer thickness.

from a hadronic gas at finite temperature. The rates are calculated by an
expansion in Pion density and constrained by broken chiral symmetry and vacuum
correlation functions, many of which have been measured by experiment. We focus
on emission processes having two Pions in the final state.
  Next, follows a separate discussion on viscous hydrodynamics and its effect
on $p_\perp$ spectra and elliptic flow. A non-central hydrodynamic model of
Au-Au collisions in 2+1 dimensions is simulated.Off-equilibrium corrections to
the distribution can bring about large changes in the differential elliptic
flow, especially at higher $p_\perp$. Also discussed is the shear viscous
correction to dilepton production in a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) emanating from
$q\overline{q}$ annihilation in the Born approximation. It is argued that a
thermal description is reliable for invariant masses less than $M_{max} \approx
(2\tau_0 T_0^2)/(\eta/s)$. Shear viscosity leads to qualitative differences in
dilepton $p_\perp$ spectrum, which could be used to extract information on the
thermalization time, viscosity to entropy ratio and possibly the thermalization
mechanism in heavy-ion collisions.
  Finally, the dilepton rates used in this work are integrated over the
space-time evolution of the collision region and compared to the recent results
from the NA60 experiment at CERN and the PHENIX experiment at RHIC. The role
played by chiral symmetry restoration in the hadronic phase and viscosity in

deconvolution of coronagraphic images. The reduced coronagraphic images allow
us to carefully measure the structures of the debris disk and reveal a number
of asymmetries of which some were not reported before (position, elevation and
thickness of the warp). In this program, the circumstellar material is visible
as close as 0.7"" ($13.5 $AU) owing to the phase mask while the Lyot mask

the effects of acoustic modes and toroidicity on the zonal flow. One possible
reason for the weak suppression of ITG turbulence by zonal flows found in
experiments in the Columbia Linear Machine (CLM) [Phys. Plasmas {\bf 13} 055905
(2006)] might be due to the small toroidicity ($\epsilon_n = 2L_n/R$) in the
experiment. The zonal flow is often directly dependent on the ITG mode and the
coupling of zonal flow to acoustic modes and hence is directly affected by any
change of the relevant parameters. The model consists of the continuity,
temperature and parallel ion momentum equations for the ITG turbulence. The
zonal flow time evolution is described by a Hasegawa-Mima like equation and a
fifth order zonal flow dispersion relation is derived. The results are
interpreted in terms of quality of zonal flows, i.e., the ratio of growth rate
and real frequency ($Q = \Omega^{IM}/\Omega^{RE}$). It is found that the
quality of the zonal flow rapidly decreases with decreasing toroidicity.

(SPADES). We focus on estimation in high-dimensional mixture models and
nonparametric adaptive density estimation. We show, respectively, that SPADES
can recover, with high probability, the unknown components of a mixture of
probability densities and that it yields minimax adaptive density estimates.
These results are based on a general sparsity oracle inequality that the SPADES
estimates satisfy. We offer a data driven method for the choice of the tuning
parameter used in the construction of SPADES. The method uses the generalized
bisection method first introduced in \citebb09. The suggested procedure
bypasses the need for a grid search and offers substantial computational
savings. We complement our theoretical results with a simulation study that
employs this method for approximations of one and two-dimensional densities
with mixtures. The numerical results strongly support our theoretical findings.

intermediate redshift (median redshift 1.02) galaxies with their rest-frame
optical morphologies. We select our sample from the deepest near-UV image
obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) using the WFPC2 (F300W) as part
of the parallel observations of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field campaign
overlapping with the HST/ACS GOODS dataset. We perform single component Sersic
fits in both WFPC2/F300W (rest-frame UV) and ACS/F850LP (rest-frame optical)
bands and deduce that the Sersic index $n$ is estimated to be smaller in the
rest-frame UV compared to the rest-frame optical, leading to an overestimation
of the number of merger candidates by ~40-100% compared to the rest-frame
optical depending upon the cutoff in $n$ employed for identifying merger
candidates. This effect seems to be dominated by galaxies with low values of
n(F300W) <= 0.5 that have a value of n(F850LP) ~ 1.0. We argue that these
objects are probably clumpy starforming galaxies or minor mergers, both of
which are essentially contaminants, if one is interested in identifying major
mergers.
  In addition we also find evidence that the axis ratio b/a is lower, i.e.
ellipticity (1-b/a) is higher in rest-frame UV compared to the rest-frame
optical. Moreover, we find that in the rest-frame UV, the number of high
ellipticity (e >= 0.8) objects are higher by a factor of ~2.8 compared to the
rest-frame optical. This indicates that the reported dominance of elongated
morphologies among high-z LBGs might just be a bias related to the use of
rest-frame UV datasets in high-z studies.

clusters. It compares the minimum spanning tree (MST) of massive stars with
that of random stars. If mass segregation is present, the MST length of the
most massive stars will be shorter than that of random stars. This difference
can be quantified (with an associated significance) to measure the degree of
mass segregation. We test the method on simulated clusters in both 2D and 3D
and show that the method works as expected.
  We apply the method to the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) and show that the
method is able to detect the mass segregation in the Trapezium with a `mass
segregation ratio' \Lambda_{MSR}=8.0 \pm 3.5 (where \Lambda_{MSR}=1 is no mass
segregation) down to 16 \Msun, and also that the ONC is mass segregated at a
lower level (~2.0 \pm 0.5) down to 5 \Msun. Below 5 \Msun we find no evidence
for any further mass segregation in the ONC.
