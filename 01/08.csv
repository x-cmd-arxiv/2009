redshift-space correlation function yield the angular diameter distance D_A(z)
and the Hubble parameter H(z) as a function of redshift, constraining the
properties of dark energy and space curvature. We discuss the perturbations
introduced in the galaxy correlation function by gravitational lensing through
the effect of magnification bias and its cross-correlation with the galaxy
density. At the BAO scale, gravitational lensing adds a small and slowly
varying component to the galaxy correlation function and does not change its
shape significantly, through which the BAO peak is measured. The relative shift
in the position of the BAO peak caused by gravitational lensing in the
angle-averaged correlation function is 10^-4 at z=1, rising to 10^-3 at z=2.5.
Lensing effects are stronger near the line-of-sight, however the relative peak
shift increases only to 10^-3.3 and 10^-2.4 at z=1 and z=2.5, when the galaxy
correlation is averaged within 5 degrees of the line-of-sight (containing only
0.4% of the galaxy pairs in a survey). Furthermore, the lensing contribution
can be measured separately and subtracted from the observed correlation at the
BAO scale.

upon which the stellar tidal acceleration can exert a force. This ""thermal
tide"" force can give rise to secular torques on the planet and orbit as well as
radial forces causing eccentricity evolution. We apply this idea to the
close-in gas giant exoplanets (""hot Jupiters""). The response of radiative
atmospheres is computed in a hydrostatic model which treats the insolation as a
time-dependent heat source, and solves for thermal radiation using flux-limited
diffusion. Fully nonlinear numerical simulations are compared to solutions of
the linearized equations, as well as analytic approximations, all of which are
in good agreement. We find generically that thermal tide density perturbations
{\it lead} the semi-diurnal forcing. As a result thermal tides can generate
asynchronous spin and eccentricity. Our results are as follows: (1) Departure
from synchronous spin is significant for hot Jupiters, and increases with
orbital period. (2) Ongoing gravitational tidal dissipation in spin equilibrium
leads to steady-state internal heating rates up to $\sim 10^{28} {\rm erg\
s^{-1}}$. If deposited sufficiently deep, these heating rates may explain the
anomalously large radii of many hot Jupiters in terms of a ""tidal main
sequence"" where cooling balances tidal heating. At fixed stellar type, planet
mass and tidal $Q$, planetary radius increases strongly toward the star inside
orbital periods $\la 2$ weeks. (3) There exists a narrow window in orbital
period where small eccentricities, $e$, grow exponentially with a large rate.
This window may explain the $\sim 1/4$ of hot Jupiters which should have been
circularized by the gravitational tide long ago, but are observed to have
significant nonzero $e$.(Abridged)

general power constraints since the vector of transmit powers is confined to

steepening or truncation at high masses. This contribution considers the
evolution of such a mass function due to cluster disruption, with emphasis on
the part of the mass function that is observable in the first ~Gyr. A Schechter
type function is used for the CIMF, with a power law index of -2 at low masses
and an exponential truncation at M*. Cluster disruption due to the tidal field
of the host galaxy and encounters with giant molecular clouds flattens the
low-mass end of the mass function, but there is always a part of the `evolved
Schechter function' that can be approximated by a power law with index -2. The
mass range for which this holds depends on age, t, and shifts to higher masses
roughly as t^0.6. Mean cluster masses derived from luminosity limited samples
increase with age very similarly due to the evolutionary fading of clusters.
Empirical mass functions are, therefore, approximately power laws with index
-2, or slightly steeper, at all ages. The results are illustrated by an
application to the star cluster population of the interacting galaxy M51, which
can be well described by a model with M*=(1.9+/-0.5)x10^5 M_sun and a short

designed to maximize the planet detection capability of the observations. The
optimal strategy maximizes detection of planet anomalies, and must be coupled
with rapid data reduction to trigger continuous follow-up of anomalies that are
thereby found. A web interface makes the scheme available for use by human or

including the lightcurve observed by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) and
spectra observed by XMM-Newton. The orientation and eccentricity of the orbit
are explored, as are the wind parameters of the stars and the nature and
physics of their close approach. Our modelling supports a viewing angle with an
inclination of ~ 42 degrees, consistent with the polar axis of the Homunculus
nebula (Smith 2006), and the projection of the observer's line-of-sight onto
the orbital plane has an angle of ~ 0 - 30 degrees in the prograde direction on
the apastron side of the semi-major axis. However, there are significant
discrepancies between the observed and model lightcurves and spectra through
the X-ray minimum. In particular, the hard flux in our synthetic spectra is an
order of magnitude greater than observed. Further calculations reveal that
radiative inhibition significantly reduces the preshock velocity of the
companion wind. As a consequence the hard X-ray emission is quenched, but it is
unclear whether the long duration of the minimum is due solely to this
mechanism alone. Models incorporating a collapse/disruption of the WCR and/or

regression a difficult problem due to the masking effect. The available high
breakdown estimators based on Least Trimmed Squares often do not succeed in
detecting masked high leverage outliers in finite samples.
  An alternative to the LTS estimator, called Penalised Trimmed Squares (PTS)
estimator, was introduced by the authors in \cite{ZiouAv:05,ZiAvPi:07} and it
appears to be less sensitive to the masking problem. This estimator is defined
by a Quadratic Mixed Integer Programming (QMIP) problem, where in the objective
function a penalty cost for each observation is included which serves as an
upper bound on the residual error for any feasible regression line. Since the
PTS does not require presetting the number of outliers to delete from the data
set, it has better efficiency with respect to other estimators. However, due to
the high computational complexity of the resulting QMIP problem, exact
solutions for moderately large regression problems is infeasible.
  In this paper we further establish the theoretical properties of the PTS
estimator, such as high breakdown and efficiency, and propose an approximate
algorithm called Fast-PTS to compute the PTS estimator for large data sets
efficiently. Extensive computational experiments on sets of benchmark instances
with varying degrees of outlier contamination, indicate that the proposed
algorithm performs well in identifying groups of high leverage outliers in
reasonable computational time.

class-(5), according to Lounesto spinor field classification based on the
relations and values taken by their associated bilinear covariants. There
exists only six such disjoint classes: the first three corresponding to Dirac
spinor fields, and the other three respectively corresponding to flagpole,
flag-dipole and Weyl spinor fields. Using the mapping from ELKO spinor fields
to the three classes Dirac spinor fields, it is shown that the
Einstein-Hilbert, the Einstein-Palatini, and the Holst actions can be derived
from the Quadratic Spinor Lagrangian (QSL), as the prime Lagrangian for
supergravity. The Holst action is related to the Ashtekar's quantum gravity
formulation. To each one of these classes, there corresponds a unique kind of
action for a covariant gravity theory. Furthermore we consider the necessary
and sufficient conditions to map Dirac spinor fields (DSFs) to ELKO, in order
to naturally extend the Standard Model to spinor fields possessing mass
dimension one. As ELKO is a prime candidate to describe dark matter and can be
obtained from the DSFs, via a mapping explicitly constructed that does not
preserve spinor field classes, we prove that in particular the
Einstein-Hilbert, Einstein-Palatini, and Holst actions can be derived from the
QSL, as a fundamental Lagrangian for supergravity, via ELKO spinor fields. The
geometric meaning of the mass dimension-transmuting operator - leading ELKO

totally unimodular (TU) matrix can be constructed through a series of
composition operations called $k$-sums starting from network matrices and their
transposes and two compact representation matrices $B_{1}, B_{2}$ of a certain
ten element matroid. Given that $B_{1}, B_{2}$ are binet matrices we examine
the $k$-sums of network and binet matrices. It is shown that the $k$-sum of a
network and a binet matrix is a binet matrix, but binet matrices are not closed
under this operation for $k=2,3$. A new class of matrices is introduced the so
called {\em tour matrices}, which generalises network, binet and totally
unimodular matrices. For any such matrix there exists a bidirected graph such
that the columns represent a collection of closed tours in the graph. It is
shown that tour matrices are closed under $k$-sums, as well as under pivoting
and other elementary operations on its rows and columns. Given the constructive
proofs of the above results regarding the $k$-sum operation and existing
recognition algorithms for network and binet matrices, an algorithm is
presented which constructs a bidirected graph for any TU matrix.

study real time series appearing in diverse scientific fields. Because its
intrinsic non-stationarity and long range dependence, its characterization via
the Hurst parameter H requires sophisticated techniques that often yield
ambiguous results. In this work we show that fBm series map into a scale free
visibility graph whose degree distribution is a function of H. Concretely, it
is shown that the exponent of the power law degree distribution depends
linearly on H. This also applies to fractional Gaussian noises (fGn) and
generic f^(-b) noises. Taking advantage of these facts, we propose a brand new

reduced from unity the Dimer correlations near the edge become longer ranged.

are strengthened near the boundary but they decrease rapidly with distance.
These results imply that deep inside the N\'{e}el phase of the $J_1-J_2$

direct transition between the two it is either first order or there is a very

particle trap, consisting of a circular hoop and a frictionless bead, with the
hoop rotating about a horizontal axis lying in the plane of the hoop. The bead
in the frame of the hoop is thus exposed to an effective sinusoidally-varying
gravitational field. This field's component along the hoop is a zero at the top
and bottom. In the same frame, the bead experiences a time-independent
centrifugal force that is zero at the top and bottom as well. The system is
analyzed in the ideal case of small displacements from the minimum, and the
motion of the particle is shown to satisfy the Mathieu equation. In the
particular case that the axis of rotation is tangential to the hoop, the system
is an exact analog for the rf Paul ion trap. Various complicating factors such
as anharmonic terms, friction and noise are considered. A working model of the
proposed system has been constructed, using a ball-bearing rolling in a tube
along the outside of a section of a bicycle rim. The apparatus demonstrates in
detail the operation of an rf Paul trap by reproducing the dynamics of trapped
atomic ions and illustrating the manner in which the electric potential varies

However, this model does not predict the universal critical surface tension
exponent, conjectured to be 11/9. Actually, the range $(1.2,1.36)$ has been
reported in experiments [21,p. 360]. By simply taking a constant kernel, this

block. We combine these ideas with those of the MIT bag model of hadrons, but
adapted to non-relativistic particles. In a second approximation we consider
the particles occupying the energy levels of the Bohr atom, so that the Casimir
force depends explicitly on the fine structure constant alpha. In both
treatments, the mean energies which have explicit dependence on the particle
mass and on the maximum occupied quantum number (related to the Fermi level of

the requirement that they be detected in all seven 2MASS and IRAC bands led to
a sample of 2692 candidate A-type stars with fully sampled 0.6 to 8 micron

templates, with the other being an A-type supergiant. Out of the 2692 A-type
candidates 17 (0.6%) were found to have 8-micron excesses above the expected
photospheric values. Taking into account non-A-Type contamination estimates,
the 8-micron excess fraction is adjusted to ~0.7%. The distances to these
sources range from 0.7-2.5 kpc. Only 10 out of the 17 excess stars had been
covered by Spitzer MIPSGAL survey fields, of which 5 had detectable excesses at
24 micron. For sources with excesses detected in at least two mid-IR wavelength
bands, blackbody fits to the excess SEDs yielded temperatures ranging from 270

2.2x10^{-3}-1.9x10^{-2}, with a mean value of 7.9x10^{-3} (these bolometric
luminosities are lower limits as cold dust is not detectable by this survey).
Both the presence of mid-IR excesses and the derived bolometric luminosity
ratios are consistent with many of these systems being in the planet-building
transition phase between the early protoplanetary disk phase and the later
debris disk phase.

major experimental observations from measuring the bulk properties of particle
production, particle ratios and chemical freeze-out conditions, elliptic flow
followed by hard probes measurements: di-jet fragment azimuthal correlations,
high-pt hadron suppression, and heavy-flavors probes. I present the
measurements as a function of collision centrality, energy, system size and for
different particle species. These results reveal that a dense strongly
interacting medium was created in central Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV: the RHIC
discovery. Further, they suggest that this medium is partonic. However, the
discoveries so far observed at RHIC are far from being understood fully.
Accordingly, the focus of the experiments has shifted from the discovery phase

large number of beamed radio-loud active galactic nuclei, but in only a handful
of the relatively unbeamed radio galaxies. We report here the detection of
parsec-scale polarization at one or more frequencies in all three FRI galaxies
studied. We detect Faraday rotation measures of the order of a few hundred
rad/m^2 in the nuclear jet regions of 3C78 and 3C264. In 3C66B polarization was
detected at 8 GHz only. A transverse rotation measure gradient is observed
across the jet of 3C78. The inner-jet magnetic field, corrected for Faraday
rotation, is found to be aligned along the jet in both 3C78 and 3C264, although
the field becomes orthogonal further from the core in 3C78. The RM values in
3C78 and 3C264 are similar to those previously observed in nearby radio
galaxies. The transverse RM gradient in 3C78, the increase in the degree of
polarization at the jet edge, the large rotation in the polarization angles due
to Faraday rotation and the low depolarization between frequencies, suggests
that a layer surrounding the jet with a sufficient number of thermal electrons
and threaded by a toroidal or helical magnetic field is a good candidate for
the Faraday rotating medium. This suggestion is tentatively supported by Hubble
Space Telescope optical polarimetry but needs to be examined in a greater
number of sources.

compact stellar systems with masses from 10^6 to 10^8 Solar masses are not
consistent with the predictions from simple stellar population (SSP) models.
Top-heavy stellar initial mass functions (IMFs) in these so-called ultra
compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) offer an attractive explanation for this finding,
the stellar remnants and retained stellar envelopes providing the unseen mass.
We therefore construct a model which quantifies by how much the IMFs of UCDs
would have to deviate in the intermediate-mass and high-mass range from the
canonical IMF in order to account for the enhanced M/L_V ratio of the UCDs. The
deduced high-mass IMF in the UCDs depends on the age of the UCDs and the number
of faint products of stellar evolution retained by them. Assuming that the IMF
in the UCDs is a three-part power-law equal to the canonical IMF in the
low-mass range and taking 20% as a plausible choice for the fraction of the
remnants of high-mass stars retained by UCDs, the model suggests the exponent
of the high-mass IMF to be approximately 1.6 if the UCDs are 13 Gyr old (i.e.
almost as old as the Universe) or approximately 1.0 if the UCDs are 7 Gyr old,
in contrast to 2.3 for the Salpeter-Massey IMF. If the IMF was as top-heavy as
suggested here, the stability of the UCDs might have been threatened by heavy
mass loss induced by the radiation and evolution of massive stars. The central
densities of UCDs must have been in the range 10^6 to 10^7 Solar masses per
cubic parsec when they formed with star formation rates of 10 to 100 Solar
masses per year.

begins to accelerate as if under the influence of a cosmological constant.
Changes in the law of gravitation are further manifest in the behavior of the

background, weak lensing, and evolution of large-scale structure. The new
parameter, $\varpi_0$, is naively expected to be of order unity. However, a

on one side of the core and an FR II lobe on the other. The X-ray spectrum of
3C 433 shows intrinsic absorption (with a column density of N_H=8e22 cm-2),
such as is typical of FR II narrow-line radio galaxies. There is excess X-ray
emission below 2 keV containing contributions from diffuse soft X-ray emission
(likely hot gas with kT~1.2 keV) as well as from the nucleus. The core of 3C
433 is extended in hard X-rays, presumably due to X-ray emission from the
inner-jet knot on the FR I side that is apparent in the radio map. It is
possible that the X-ray emission from this inner-jet knot is absorbed by the
dust known to be present in the host galaxy. The spectrum of 4C 65.15 can be
modeled with a simple power law with perhaps mild intrinsic absorption
(N_H=1.3e21 cm-2). X-ray emission is detected at the bend in the FR I jet. This
X-ray jet emission lies above the extrapolation from the high-frequency radio
synchrotron emission and has a spectral slope flatter than alpha_rx, indicating
that the jet spectral energy distribution is concave as with other FR II quasar
jets. Both 3C 433 and 4C 65.15 have unabsorbed X-ray luminosities, radio
luminosities, and optical spectra typically seen in comparable sources with FR
II morphologies. Presumably the FR I structure seen on one side in these hybrid
sources is generated by a powerful jet interacting with a relatively dense
environment.

device conception. In such device an electric bias realizes the writing bits
instead a magnetic field of remote word line with high energy consumption.
Interplay of two graphene mediated exchange bias fields applied to different
sides of free ferromagnet results in programable logic operations that depends
on specific realization of the structure.

done under a reasonable assumed form of the change in the distribution

Keplerian solutions are fitted to radial-velocity data. However, for several
stars, no satisfactory solution could be found, despite the fact that the
radial-velocity standard deviation is larger than the instrumental error,
because M giants suffer from intrinsic radial-velocity variations due to
pulsations. We show that these intrinsic radial-velocity variations can be
linked with both the average spectral-line width and the photometric
variability. We present an extensive collection of spectroscopic orbits for M
giants, with 12 new orbits, plus 17 from the literature. Moreover, to
illustrate the fact that the large radial-velocity jitter present in Mira and
semi-regular variables may easily be confused with orbital variations, we also
present examples of pseudo-orbital variations (in S UMa, X Cnc and possibly in
HD 115521, a former IAU radial-velocity standard). Because of this difficulty,
M giants involving Mira variables were excluded from our monitored sample. We

enables many species of bacteria to swim. Torque is generated by interaction of
stator units, anchored to the peptidoglycan cell wall, with the rotor. Recent
experiments [Yuan, J. & Berg, H. C. (2008) PNAS 105, 1182-1185] show that near
zero load the speed of the motor is independent of the number of stators. Here,
we introduce a mathematical model of the motor dynamics that explains this
behavior based on a general assumption that the stepping rate of a stator
depends on the torque exerted by the stator on the rotor. We find that the
motor dynamics can be characterized by two time scales: the moving-time
interval for the mechanical rotation of the rotor and the waiting-time interval
determined by the chemical transitions of the stators. We show that these two
time scales depend differently on the load, and that their crossover provides
the microscopic explanation for the existence of two regimes in the
torque-speed curves observed experimentally. We also analyze the speed
fluctuation for a single motor using our model. We show that the motion is
smoothed by having more stator units. However, the mechanism for such
fluctuation reduction is different depending on the load. We predict that the
speed fluctuation is determined by the number of steps per revolution only at
low load and is controlled by external noise for high load. Our model can be
generalized to study other molecular motor systems with multiple
power-generating units.

radial-velocity standard deviation for our samples are used to define
appropriate binarity criteria. These then serve to extract the binarity
fraction among the M giants. Comparison is made to earlier data on K giants
binarity frequency. The Sb parameter is discussed in relation to global stellar
parameters and the Sb vs. stellar radius relation is used to identify fast
rotators. We find that the spectroscopic binary detection rate among field M
giants, in a sample with a low number of velocity measurements (~2), unbiased
toward earlier known binaries, is 6.3%. This is less than half of the analogous
rate for field K giants, likely resulting from a real difference. This
difference originates in the greater difficulty of finding binaries among M
giants because of their smaller orbital velocity amplitudes and larger
intrinsic jitter and in the different distributions of K and M giants in the
eccentricity-period diagram. A larger detection rate was obtained in a smaller
M giant sample with more radial velocity measurements per object: 11.1%
confirmed plus 2.7% possible binaries. The CORAVEL spectroscopic parameter Sb
was found to correlate better with the stellar radius than with either
luminosity or effective temperature separately. Two outliers of the Sb vs.
stellar radius relation, HD 190658 and HD 219654, have been recognized as fast

class of binaries and related systems. The orbital properties of binaries
involving M giants were analysed and compared with those of related families of
binaries (K giants, post-AGB stars, barium stars, Tc-poor S stars). The orbital
elements of post-AGB stars and M giants are not different, which may very
indicate that, for the considered sample of post-AGB binaries, the post-AGB
star left the AGB at quite an early stage (M4 or so). Neither are the orbital
elements of post-mass-transfer binaries like barium stars very different from
those of M giants, suggesting that the mass transfer did not alter the orbital
elements much, contrary to current belief. Finally, we show that binary systems
with e < 0.4 log P - 1 (with periods expressed in days) are predominantly
post-mass-transfer systems, because (i) the vast majority of barium and S
systems match this condition, and (ii) these systems have companion masses
peaking around 0.6 solar mass, as expected for white dwarfs. The latter
property has been shown to hold as well for open-cluster binaries involving K
giants, for which a lower bound on the companion mass may easily be set.

serve as a token of the missing reference frame. We here introduce a novel
measure of the quality of such a token: the relative entropy of frameness. This
is defined as the relative entropy distance between the state of interest and
the nearest G-invariant state. Unlike the relative entropy of entanglement,
this quantity is straightforward to calculate and we find it to be precisely
equal to the G-asymmetry, a measure of frameness introduced by Vaccaro et al.
It is shown to provide an upper bound on the mutual information between the
group element encoded into the token and the group element that may be
extracted from it by measurement. In this sense, it quantifies the extent to
which the token successfully simulates a full reference frame. We also show,
that despite a suggestive analogy from entanglement theory, the regularized
relative entropy of frameness is zero and therefore does not quantify the rate
of interconversion between the token and some standard form of quantum
reference frame. Finally, we show how these investigations yield a novel
approach to bounding the relative entropy of entanglement.

field theory on the world sheet for summing the planar graphs of phi^3 theory
was developed. In this earlier work, the ground state of the model was
determined using a variational approximation. Here, starting with the same
world sheet theory, we instead use the mean field method to compute the ground
state, and find results in agreement with the variational calculation. Apart
from serving as a check on the variational calculation, the mean field method
enables us to go beyond the ground state to compute the excited states of the
model. The spectrum of these states is that of a string with linear
trajectories, plus a continuum that starts at higher energy. We show that, by
appropriately tuning the parameters of the model, the string spectrum can be
cleanly seperated from the continuum.

the cosmic microwave background (CMB) as a probe of superhorizon tensor
perturbations created by inflation. By causality, any non-inflationary
mechanism for gravitational wave production after reheating, like global phase
transitions or cosmic strings, must have vanishing correlations for angular
separations greater than the angle subtended by the particle horizon at
recombination, i.e. $\theta \gtrsim 2^\circ$. Since ordinary $B$-modes are
defined non-locally in terms of the Stokes parameters $Q$ and $U$ and therefore
don't have to respect causality, special care is taken to define `causal
$\tilde B$-modes' for the analysis. We compute the real space $\tilde B$-mode
correlation function for inflation and discuss its detectability on
superhorizon scales where it provides an unambiguous test of inflationary
gravitational waves. The correct identification of inflationary tensor modes is
crucial since it relates directly to the energy scale of inflation. Wrongly
associating tensor modes from causal seeds with inflation would imply an
incorrect inference of the energy scale of inflation. We find that the
superhorizon $\tilde B$-mode signal is above cosmic variance for the angular
range $2^\circ < \theta < 4^\circ$ and is therefore in principle detectable. In
practice, the signal will be challenging to measure since it requires
accurately resolving the recombination peak of the $B$-mode power spectrum.
However, a future CMB satellite (CMBPol), with noise level $\Delta_P \simeq
1\mu$K-arcmin and sufficient resolution to efficiently correct for
lensing-induced $B$-modes, should be able to detect the signal at more than
3$\sigma$ if the tensor-to-scalar ratio isn't smaller than $r \simeq 0.01$.

modification allows the RKKY oscillation to change sign. Consequently, while
the previous approach only favors ferromagnetism for this system, an
antiferromagnetic coupling is in fact possible. Since the Mn-rich Mn(Ga)As
nanoclusters are naturally formed and bound to have different sizes, their spin
orientation is likely to be frustrated due to mixed preferences from different

absorption spectra with corresponding emission spectra for study of the
distribution of warm and cool phase H I in the interstellar medium. These
emission-absorption spectrum pairs are used to study the temperature of the
interstellar neutral hydrogen in the outer disk of the Milky Way, outside the
solar circle, to a radius of 25 kpc.
  The cool neutral medium is distributed in radius and height above the plane
with very similar parameters to the warm neutral medium. In particular, the
ratio of the emission to the absorption, which gives the mean spin temperature
of the gas, stays nearly constant with radius to 25 kpc radius. This suggests
that the mixture of cool and warm phases is a robust quantity, and that the
changes in the interstellar environment do not force the H I into a regime
where there is only one temperature allowed. The mixture of atomic gas phases
in the outer disk is roughly 15% to 20% cool (40 K to 60 K), the rest warm,
corresponding to mean spin temperature 250 to 400 K.
  The Galactic warp appears clearly in the absorption data, and other features

is irradiated by a power-law continuum which is attenuated by intervening gas,
presumably closer to the central source. The radiation incident upon the low
ionization gas, external to the bi-cone, is much more heavily absorbed. These
absorbers are similar to the intrinsic UV and X-ray absorbers detected in many

networks including food webs, and play a vital role in recent models of food
web structure. While food webs degree distributions have been suggested to
follow various functional forms, to date there has been no mechanistic or
statistical explanation for these forms. Here I introduce models for the degree
distributions of food webs based on the principle of maximum entropy (MaxEnt)
constrained by the number of species, number of links and the number of top or
basal species. The MaxEnt predictions are compared to observed distributions in
51 food webs. The distributions of the number of consumers and resources in 23
(45%) and 35 (69%) of the food webs respectively are not significantly
different at a 95% confidence level from the MaxEnt distribution. While the
resource distributions of niche model webs are well-described by the MaxEnt
model, the consumer distributions are more narrowly distributed than predicted
by the MaxEnt model. These findings offer a new null model for the most
probable degree distributions in food webs. Having an appropriate null
hypothesis in place allows informative study of the deviations from it; for
example these results suggest that there is relatively little pressure favoring
generalist versus specialist consumption strategies but that there is more
pressure driving the consumer distribution away from the MaxEnt form. Given the
methodological idiosyncrasies of current food web data, further study of such
deviations will need to consider both biological drivers and methodological
bias.

understand how the zero-point energy of quantum fields contributes to gravity.
Here we take the approach that by addressing a fundamental unresolved issue in
quantum theory we can gain a better understanding of the problem. Our starting
point is the observation that the notion of classical time is external to
quantum mechanics. Hence there must exist an equivalent reformulation of
quantum mechanics which does not refer to an external classical time. Such a
reformulation is a limiting case of a more general quantum theory which becomes
nonlinear on the Planck mass/energy scale. The nonlinearity gives rise to a
quantum-classical duality which maps a `strongly quantum, weakly gravitational'
dynamics to a `weakly quantum, strongly gravitational' dynamics. This duality
predicts the existence of a tiny nonzero cosmological constant of the order of
the square of the Hubble constant, which could be a possible source for the
observed cosmic acceleration. Such a nonlinearity could also be responsible for
the collapse of the wave-function during a quantum measurement. We conclude by
suggesting that the idea for the origin of dark energy proposed in this paper
can be tested indirectly in the laboratory by a detailed examination of the
process of quantum measurement.

manual, conceptual and statistical ability to investigate physical phenomena.
Needing very simple apparatus, pendulum experiments are an ideal starting point
in our first-year laboratory course because they are rich in both physical
content and data processing. These experiments allow many variations, e.g.
pendulum bobs can have different shapes, threads can be tied to a hook at their
edge or pass through their centre of mass, they can be hanged as simple or
bifilar pendulums. In these many variations, they emphasize the difference
between theory and practice in the passage from an idealized scheme to a real
experimental asset, which becomes evident, for example, when the pendulum bob
cannot be considered an idealized point mass. Moreover, they require careful
observation of details such as the type of thread used and its rigidity or the
bob initial slant, which leads to different behaviors. Their mathematical
models require a wide range of fundamental topics in experimental data
analysis: arithmetic and weighted mean, standard deviation, central limit
theorem application, data distribution, and the significant difference between
theory and practice. Setting the mass-spring experiment immediately after the
pendulum highlights the question of resonance, revises the gap between theory
and practice in another context, and provides another occasion to practice
further techniques in data analysis.

measure proper motions of X-ray sources with an unprecedented accuracy in this

seven thermally emitting radio-quiet isolated neutron stars (INSs) discovered
in the ROSAT all-sky survey. These INSs (RX J0420.0-5022, RX J0806.4-4123, and
RX J1308.6+2127) either lack an optical counterpart or have one so faint that
ground based or space born optical observations push the current possibilities
of the instrumentation to the limit. Pairs of ACIS observations were acquired 3
to 5 years apart to measure the displacement of the sources on the X-ray sky
using as reference the background of extragalactic or remote Galactic X-ray
sources. We derive 2 sigma upper limits of 123 mas/yr and 86 mas/yr on the
proper motion of RX J0420.0-5022 and RX J0806.4-4123, respectively. RX
J1308.6+2127 exhibits a very significant displacement (~ 9 sigma) yielding mu =
220 +/- 25 mas/yr, the second fastest measured among all ROSAT discovered INSs.
The source is probably moving away rapidly from the Galactic plane at a speed
which precludes any significant accretion of matter from the interstellar
medium. Its transverse velocity of ~ 740 (d/700pc) km/s might be the largest of
all ROSAT INSs and its corresponding spatial velocity stands among the fastest
recorded for neutron stars. RX J1308.6+2127 is thus a middle-aged (age ~ 1 My)
high velocity cooling neutron star. We investigate its possible origin in
nearby OB associations or from a field OB star. In most cases, the flight time
from birth place appears significantly shorter than the characteristic age
derived from spin down rate. The distribution in transverse velocity of ROSAT
INSs is not statistically different from that of normal radio pulsars.

of its frequency when the absorption edge shifts across the phonon energy due
to the temperature dependence of the direct band gap. As the temperature

a semiconductor to a semimetal. The corresponding gain of the spectral weight

This study aims to develop an indirect observational method of ices based on
non-thermal ice desorption in the colder part of protostellar envelopes. For
that purpose the IRAM 30m telescope was employed to observe two molecules that
can be detected both in the gas and the ice, CH3 OH and HNCO, toward 4 low mass
embedded protostars. Their respective gas-phase column densities are determined
using rotational diagrams. The relationship between ice and gas phase
abundances is subsequently determined. The observed gas and ice abundances span
several orders of magnitude. Most of the CH3OH and HNCO gas along the lines of
sight is inferred to be quiescent from the measured line widths and the derived
excitation temperatures, and hence not affected by thermal desorption close to
the protostar or in outflow shocks. The measured gas to ice ratio of ~10-4
agrees well with model predictions for non-thermal desorption under cold
envelope conditions and there is a tentative correlation between ice and gas
phase abundances. This indicates that non-thermal desorption products can serve
as a signature of the ice composition. A larger sample is however necessary to

differential equations have enjoyed considerable success because they are both
flexible and robust: They allow arbitrary unstructured geometries and easy
control of accuracy without compromising simulation stability. Lately, another
property of DG has been growing in importance: The majority of a DG operator is
applied in an element-local way, with weak penalty-based element-to-element
coupling.
  The resulting locality in memory access is one of the factors that enables DG
to run on off-the-shelf, massively parallel graphics processors (GPUs). In
addition, DG's high-order nature lets it require fewer data points per
represented wavelength and hence fewer memory accesses, in exchange for higher
arithmetic intensity. Both of these factors work significantly in favor of a
GPU implementation of DG.
  Using a single US$400 Nvidia GTX 280 GPU, we accelerate a solver for
Maxwell's equations on a general 3D unstructured grid by a factor of 40 to 60
relative to a serial computation on a current-generation CPU. In many cases,
our algorithms exhibit full use of the device's available memory bandwidth.
Example computations achieve and surpass 200 gigaflops/s of net

flow are studied by Direct Numerical Simulations. We consider sinusoidal waves
of spanwise velocity which vary in time and are modulated in space along the
streamwise direction. The phase speed may be null, positive or negative, so
that the waves may be either stationary or traveling forward or backward in the
direction of the mean flow. Such a forcing includes as particular cases two
known techniques for reducing friction drag: the oscillating wall technique (a
traveling wave with infinite phase speed) and the recently proposed steady
distribution of spanwise velocity (a wave with zero phase speed).
  The traveling waves alter the friction drag significantly. Waves which slowly
travel forward produce a large reduction of drag, that can relaminarize the
flow at low values of the Reynolds number. Faster waves yield a totally
different outcome, i.e. drag increase. Even faster waves produce a drag
reduction effect again. Backward-traveling waves instead lead to drag reduction
at any speed.
  The traveling waves, when they reduce drag, operate in similar fashion to the
oscillating wall, with an improved energetic efficiency. Drag increase is
observed when the waves travel at a speed comparable with that of the
convecting near-wall turbulence structures. A diagram illustrating the
different flow behaviors is presented.

jet structure can be formed magnetohydrodynamically within a valley of the
magnetic pressures, which is formed between the peaks due to the poloidal and
toroidal components, with the centrifugal force acting on the rotating sheath
plasma is balanced by the hoop stress of the toroidal field. The poloidal field
concentrated near the polar axis is maintained by a converging plasma flow
toward the jet region, and the toroidal field is developed outside the jet cone
owing to the poloidal current circulating through the jet. Under such
situations, the set of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations allows two main
types of solutions, at least, in the region far from the footpoint. The first
type solution describes the jets of marginally bound nature. This type is
realized when the jet temperature decreases like viral one, and neither the
pressure-gradient nor the MHD forces, which are both determined consistently,
cannot completely overcome the gravity even at infinity. The second type is
realized under an isothermal situation, and the gravity is cancelled exactly by
the pressure-gradient force. Hence, the jets of this type are accelerated
purely by the MHD force. It is suggested also that these two types correspond,
respectively, to the jets from type I and II radio galaxies in the
Fanaroff-Riley classification.

waves can, however, be confined by total internal reflection at dielectric
boundaries. These resonators enrich the class of model systems in the field of
quantum chaos and are an ideal testing ground for the correspondence of ray and
wave dynamics that, typically, is taken for granted. Using phase-space methods
we show that this assumption has to be corrected towards the long-wavelength
limit. Generalizing the concept of Husimi functions to dielectric interfaces,
we find that curved interfaces require a semiclassical correction of Fresnel's
law due to an interference effect called Goos-Haenchen shift. It is accompanied
by the so-called Fresnel filtering which, in turn, corrects Snell's law. These
two contributions are especially important near the critical angle. They are of
similar magnitude and correspond to ray displacements in independent
phase-space directions that can be incorporated in an adjusted reflection law.
We show that deviations from ray-wave correspondence can be straightforwardly
understood with the resulting adjusted reflection law and discuss its
consequences for the phase-space dynamics in optical billiards.

driven into the fast stellar wind (v ~ 1000 km/s) as it collides with an
earlier circumstellar slow wind (v ~ 10 km/s). In theory, the shocked fast wind
(hot bubble) and the ambient cold nebula can remain separated by magnetic
fields along a surface referred to as the contact discontinuity (CD) that
inhibits diffusion and heat conduction. The CD region is extremely difficult to
probe directly owing to its small size and faint emission. This has largely
left the study of CDs, stellar-shocks, and the associated micro-physics in the
realm of theory. This paper presents spectroscopic evidence for ions from the
hot bubble (kT ~ 100 eV) crossing the CD and penetrating the cold nebular gas
(kT ~ 1 eV). Specifically, a narrow radiative recombination continuum (RRC)
emission feature is identified in the high resolution X-ray spectrum of the PN
BD+30 3639 indicating bare C VII ions are recombining with cool electrons at
kT_e=1.7+-1.3 eV. An upper limit to the flux of the narrow RRC of H-like C VI
is obtained as well. The RRCs are interpreted as due to C ions from the hot
bubble of BD+30 3639 crossing the CD into the cold nebula, where they
ultimately recombine with its cool electrons. The RRC flux ratio of C VII to C
VI constrains the temperature jump across the CD to Delta kT > 80 eV, providing
for the first time direct evidence for the stark temperature disparity between
the two sides of an astrophysical CD, and constraining the role of magnetic
fields and heat conduction accordingly. Two colliding-wind binaries are noted
to have similar RRCs suggesting a temperature jump and CD crossing by ions may
be a common feature of stellar wind shocks.

approximation (DCA) approach is used to incorporate momentum dependence into
the Eliashberg equations. First, I consider the effects of introducing partial
momentum dependence on the standard Eliashberg theory using a quasi-local
approximation; which I use to demonstrate that it is essential to include
corrections beyond the standard theory when investigating d-wave states. Using
the extended theory with vertex corrections, I compute electron and phonon
spectral functions. A kink in the electronic dispersion is found in the normal
state along the major symmetry directions, similar to that found in
photo-emission from cuprates. The phonon spectral function shows that for weak
coupling $W\lambda < \omega_0$, the dispersion for phonons has weak momentum
dependence, with consequences for the theory of optical phonon mediated d-wave
superconductivity, which is shown to be 2nd order in $\lambda$. In particular,
examination of the order parameter vs. filling shows that vertex corrections
lead to d-wave superconductivity mediated via simple optical phonons. I map out
the order parameters in detail, showing that there is significant induced
anisotropy in the superconducting pairing in quasi-2D systems.

diameter $R$. Far below a ""hadronic"" Compton wave length $\lambda_{0}$ of order
1 fermi, $R\ll \lambda_{0}$, there is no room left for too small filter
elements, that would, however, be necessary for a filter convergence to an
isolated cold quantum mechanical point particle. When the expansion of the

the breakdown of the conventional theory of metals in a wide range of
three-dimensional materials. However the existence of fractional excitations in
three dimensions remains highly controversial. In this Letter we report direct
numerical evidence for the existence of a quantum liquid phase supporting
fractional excitations in a concrete, three-dimensional microscopic model - the
quantum dimer model on a diamond lattice. We demonstrate explicitly that the
energy cost of separating fractional monomer excitations vanishes in this
liquid phase, and that its energy spectrum matches that of the Coulomb phase in
(3+1) dimensional quantum electrodynamics.

function, in the collisional integral of the classical Boltzmman equation, fix
univocally the entropy of the system, which turn out to be the
Boltzmann-Gibbs-Shannon entropy.
  In the ordinary relativistic Boltzmann equation, some standard
generalizations, with respect its classical version, imposed by the special
relativity, are customarily performed. The only ingredient of the equation,
which tacitly remains in its original classical form, is the two-particle
correlation function, and this fact imposes that also the relativistic kinetics
is governed by the Boltzmann-Gibbs-Shannon entropy. Indeed the ordinary
relativistic Boltzmann equation admits as stationary stable distribution, the
exponential Juttner distribution.
  Here, we show that the special relativity laws and the maximum entropy
principle, suggest a relativistic generalization also of the two-particle
correlation function and then of the entropy. The so obtained, fully
relativistic Boltzmann equation, obeys the H-theorem and predicts a stationary
stable distribution, presenting power-law tails in the high energy region. The
ensued relativistic kinetic theory preserves the main features of the classical
kinetics, which recovers in the $c \to \infty$ limit.

partially open/closed ones - the Massieu functions. Convexity and/or concavity
properties of these functions are determined, their first and second

functions - the Gibbs-Helmholtz functions - are obtained from previous ones as
their Massieu-Planck transforms, i.e. by specific transformation of arguments
(which involves the temperature) and by applying the temperature with the minus
as a prefactor. Such functions are closer to traditional (Gibbs, Helmholtz)
thermodynamic potentials. However, the first and second derivatives of these

Massieu functions. All introduced functions are suitable for application to the
extensions of the density functional theory, both at finite and zero

standard model, NCSM, can directly couple to the photon and the Z-gauge boson.
Therefore the observed flux of neutrinos from SN1987A can constrain the
strength of the new couplings in the NCSM. We obtain two bounds on the
NC-parameter, $\Lambda_{NC}=1/{\sqrt |\th|} $, with respect to escaping or
trapping of the right handed neutrinos inside the supernova which are
$\Lambda_{NC}\gtrsim 3.7 TeV$ or $\Lambda_{NC}\lesssim 1 TeV$, respectively.
The excluded region $1 TeV\lesssim\Lambda_{NC}\lesssim 3.7 TeV$ for the
NC-parameter is obtained for the first time. In fact $\Lambda_{NC}\lesssim 1
TeV$ is consistent with the existing bounds on $\Lambda_{NC}$ and raises our
hopes to find the NC-effects in the LHC or even in the LEP. Meanwhile
$\Lambda_{NC}\gtrsim 3.7 TeV$ is more stringent than the other bounds obtained
from LEP and LHC considerations. Furthermore, since NC-calculations are
perturbative and are correct only up to the energy scale of the NC-system
$\lesssim\Lambda_{NC} $, therefore these bounds which are obtained from the
energy scale considerably less than the energy scale of LEP and LHC are more
reliable.

projection is consistent with large long-range electron-phonon coupling and
large repulsive Hubbard $U$. Significant differences are found between the band
structure of singlet and triplet states: The triplet state (which has a flat
band) is found to be significantly heavier than the singlet state (which has
mass similar to the polaron). We test whether the heavier triplet states
persist to lower electron-phonon coupling using continuous time quantum Monte
Carlo (QMC) simulation. The triplet state is both heavier and larger,
demonstrating that the heavier mass is due to quantum interference effects on
the motion. We also find that retardation effects reduce the differences
between singlet and triplet states, since they reintroduce second order terms
in the hopping into the inverse effective mass.
