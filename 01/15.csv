ultimately a collision of these objects with their host star. Consequently,
conventional circularization and synchronization timescales cannot be defined
because the corresponding states do not represent the endpoint of the tidal
evolution. Using numerical simulations of the coupled tidal equations for the
spin and orbital parameters of each transiting planetary system, we confirm
these predictions and show that the orbital eccentricity and the stellar
obliquity do not follow the usually assumed exponential relaxation but instead
decrease significantly, reaching eventually a zero value, only during the final
runaway merging of the planet with the star. The only characteristic evolution
timescale of {\it all} rotational and orbital parameters is the lifetime of the
system, which crucially depends on the magnitude of tidal dissipation within
the star. These results imply that the nearly circular orbits of transiting
planets and the alignment between the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbit
are unlikely to be due to tidal dissipation. Other dissipative mechanisms, for
instance interactions with the protoplanetary disk, must be invoked to explain
these properties.

accretion models of YSOs is employed to fit the observed SED to obtain various
physical parameters. The SED of IRCs were fitted by models of massive
protostars with a range of masses between 5-42 Msun and ages between 10^3 and
10^6 years. The median mass and age are 10 Msun and 10^4 yrs. The envelopes are
large with a mean size of ~ 0.2-0.3 pc and show a distribution that is very
similar to the distribution of the sizes of 8 micron nebulae discussed in Paper
I. The estimated envelope accretion rates are high with a mean value of 10^(-3)
Msun/yr and show a power law dependence to mass with an exponent of 2,
suggesting spherical accretion at those scales. Disks are found to exist in
most of the sources with a mean mass of 10^(-1.4+-0.7) Msun. The observed
infrared-millimetre SED of the infrared counterparts of HMPOs are successfully
explained with an YSO accretion model. The modelled sources mostly represent
proto-B stars although some of them could become O stars in future. We
demonstrate that many of these results may represent a realistic picture of
massive star formation, despite some of the results which may be an effect of
the assumptions within the models.

material within an annular shear cell. Specifically, two-dimensional assemblies
of disks are placed between two circular walls, the inner one rotating with
prescribed angular velocity, while the outer one may expand or shrink and
maintains a constant radial pressure. Focusing on steady state flows, we
delineate in parameter space the range of applicability of the recently
introduced constitutive laws for sheared granular materials (based on the
inertial number). We discuss the two origins of the stronger strain rates
observed near the inner boundary, the vicinity of the wall and the
heteregeneous stress field in a Couette cell. Above a certain velocity, an
inertial region develops near the inner wall, to which the known constitutive
laws apply, with suitable corrections due to wall slip, for small enough stress
gradients. Away from the inner wall, slow, apparently unbounded creep takes
place in the nominally solid material, although its density and shear to normal
stress ratio are on the jammed side of the critical values. In addition to
rheological characterizations, our simulations provide microscopic information
on the contact network and velocity fluctuations that is potentially useful to
assess theoretical approaches.

results include the following:
  An $(r,l)$-system is an $r$-uniform hypergraph with every two edges sharing
at most $l$ vertices. For $k$ sufficiently large, the minimum number of edges
in an $(r,l)$-system with chromatic number greater than $k$ is at most
$c(k^{r-1}\log k)^{l/(l-1)}$, where $$c<...$$ This improves on the previous
best bounds of Kostochka-Mubayi-R\""odl-Tetali \cite{KMRT}. The upper bound is
sharp aside from the constant $c$ as shown in \cite{KMRT}.
  The minimum number of edges in an $r$-uniform hypergraph with independent

k^{r+1/(r-1)}$ as $k \to \infty$. This generalizes (aside from logarithmic
factors) a result of Gimbel and Thomassen \cite{GT} for triangle-free graphs.
  Let $T$ be an $r$-uniform hypertree of $t$ edges. Then every $T$-free
$r$-uniform hypergraph has chromatic number at most $p(t)$, where $p(t)$ is a
polynomial in $t$. This generalizes the well known fact that every $T$-free

derivation of the hierarchy of differential equations is supplemented by a
comparison with the known sharp cut-off HRT. Then, the theory is applied to a
hard core Yukawa fluid (HCYF): a closure, based on a mean spherical
approximation ansatz, is studied in detail and its intriguing relationship to
the self consistent Ornstein-Zernike approximation is discussed. The asymptotic
properties, close to the critical point are investigated and compared to the
renormalization group results both above and below the critical temperature.
The HRT free energy is always a convex function of the density, leading to flat
isotherms in the two-phase region with a finite compressibility at coexistence.
This makes HRT the sole liquid-state theory able to obtain directly fluid-fluid
phase equilibrium without resorting to the Maxwell construction. The way the
mean field free energy is modified due to the inclusion of density fluctuations
suggests how to identify the spinodal curve. Thermodynamic properties and
correlation functions of the HCYF are investigated for three values of the
inverse Yukawa range: z=1.8, z=4 and z=7 where Monte Carlo simulations are
available. The stability of the liquid-vapor critical point with respect to

rotation rate, magnetic fields and metallicity. Theory suggests that some
massive stars (initially greater than 25-30 solar masses) end up as Wolf-Rayet
stars which are deficient in hydrogen because of mass loss through strong
stellar winds. The most massive of these stars have cores which may form a
black hole and theory predicts that the resulting explosion produces ejecta of
low kinetic energy, a faint optical display and a small mass fraction of
radioactive nickel(1,2,3). An alternative origin for low energy supernovae is
the collapse of the oxygen-neon core of a relatively lowmass star (7-9 solar
masses) through electron capture(4,5). However no weak, hydrogen deficient,
core-collapse supernovae are known. Here we report that such faint, low energy
core-collapse supernovae do exist, and show that SN2008ha is the faintest
hydrogen poor supernova ever observed. We propose that other similar events
have been observed but they have been misclassified as peculiar thermonuclear
supernovae (sometimes labelled SN2002cx-like events(6)). This discovery could
link these faint supernovae to some long duration gamma-ray bursts. Extremely

narrow P-Cygni lines characteristic of this SN family, which are indicative of
a very low expansion velocity (about 1000 km/s) of the ejected material. The
optical light curves cover both the plateau phase and the late-time radioactive
tail, until about 380 days after core-collapse. Numerous unfiltered

monitor the fast rise to maximum light, lasting about 2 days. In addition to
optical observations, we also present near-infrared light curves that (together

Selection rules for the intershell coupling are derived. Due to the finite size

momentum, but only an approximate one; therefore the coupling between
longitudinal momentum states in incommensurate DWNTs becomes possible. The use
of the selection rules allows a fast and efficient calculation of the

We propose a general method to transform standard models of adaptive agents
into asynchronous systems while preserving their global structure under some
conditions. Using the Minority Game as an example, we find that the phase and
fluctuations structure of the standard game subsists even in maximally
asynchronous deterministic case, but that it disappears if too much
stochasticity is added to the temporal structure of interaction. Allowing for
heterogeneous communication speeds and activity patterns gives rise to a new

symmetric channel. The binary message passing algorithms, while allowing
extremely fast hardware implementation, are not very attractive from the
perspective of performance. More complex decoders such as the ones based on
belief propagation exhibit superior performance but lead to slower decoders.
The approach in this paper is to consider message passing decoders that have
larger message alphabet (thereby providing performance improvement) as well as
low complexity (thereby ensuring fast decoding). We propose a class of
message-passing decoders whose messages are represented by two bits. The
thresholds for various decoders in this class are derived using density
evolution. The problem of correcting a fixed number of errors assumes
significance in the error floor region. For a specific decoder, the sufficient
conditions for correcting all patterns with up to three errors are derived. By
comparing these conditions and thresholds to the similar ones when Gallager B
decoder is used, we emphasize the advantage of decoding on a higher number of
bits, even if the channel observation is still one bit.

problems where the number of hypotheses is exponentially large. Such problems
characterize many important applications including detection and classification
of targets in a geographical area using a network of sensors, and detecting
complex substances with a chemical sensor array. We refer to such applications
as largescale detection problems. Using the insight that these problems share
fundamental similarities with the problem of communicating over a noisy
channel, we define a quantity called the sensing capacity and lower bound it
for a number of sensor network models. The sensing capacity expression differs
significantly from the channel capacity due to the fact that a fixed sensor
configuration encodes all states of the environment. As a result, codewords are
dependent and non-identically distributed. The sensing capacity provides a
bound on the minimal number of sensors required to detect the state of an
environment to within a desired accuracy. The results differ significantly from
classical detection theory, and provide an ntriguing connection between sensor
networks and communications. In addition, we discuss the insight that sensing
capacity provides for the problem of sensor selection.

features and emission lines from molecular and atomic hydrogen are detected but
not particularly strong. The dominant spectral features are emission lines from
moderately ionized species of argon, neon, and sulphur, which are used to
determine the physical conditions in the ionized gas. The ionized gas
excitation shows strong variations on parsec scales, some of which can
plausibly be associated with individual hot stars. We fit the ionic line
strengths with photoionization and shock models, and find that photoionization
dominates in the region. The ionization parameter U traces the rim of the
central bubble, as well as highlighting isolated sources of ionization, and at
least one quiescent clump. The hardness of the ionizing radiation field T_rad
reveals several ""hot spots"" that are either the result of individual very hot
stars or trace the propagation of the diffuse ionizing field through the
surrounding neutral cloud. Consistent with other measurements of giant
molecular hydrogen regions, log(U) ranges between -3 and -0.75, and T_rad
between 30000 and 85000K.

three-dimensional cube. The field of view was 5.""8 X 4.""2. We confirmed that
the position of the knot PHK1 coincides with a stationary, point-like x-ray
source within 0.""3. The northern and southern jets are distinguished from each
other at a point 0.""6 away from their driving sources. We also confirmed that
the northern jet consists of well-separated high- and low-velocity components
(HVC and LVC, respectively). The HVC has a terminal velocity of ~400 km/s and
shows a consistently narrow velocity width of 40 km/s. The LVC covers the
velocity range from V_LSR = 0 to -240 km/s and has broad velocity widths of
~150-180 km/s. These decrease with distance from the driving sources. The
spatial width of the LVC varies from 0.""6-0.""7 at V_LSR ~ -200 km/s to
0.""8-0.""9 at V_LSR ~ -30 km/s. These characteristics are well understood in
terms of the two types of outflow mechanisms that are working simultaneously:
one is the HVC, which is launched in a narrow, inner radial region at 0.04-0.05
AU, and the other is the LVC, which is launched in a wider, outer radial region
from within 0.1-4.5 AU of the accretion disk. Part of the LVC emission could
arise in the gas entrained or shocked by the HVC. We also discuss the
possibility that part of the HVC gas is thermalized at PHK1 to produce the
x-ray emission and LVC.

a realization of a mixed Tate motive. This is the cohomology of the pair of the
determinant hypersurface complement and a normal crossings divisor depending
only on the number of loops and the genus of the graph. We show explicitly that
this relative cohomology is a realization of a mixed Tate motive in the case of
three loops and we give alternative formulations of the main question in the
general case, by describing the locus of intersection of the divisor with the
determinant hypersurface complement in terms of intersections of unions of
Schubert cells in flag varieties. We also discuss different methods of
regularization aimed at removing the divergences of the Feynman integral.

frequently faced with important problems, e.g. classical instabilities and
strong coupling problems which are hard to resolve without a known UV
completion of the theory. In this note, we review a recent attempt to study
some of these well known problems with the use of the AdS/CFT correspondence.
In this context, products of large-N conformal field theories coupled by
multi-trace interactions in diverse dimensions are used to define quantum
multi-gravity (multi-string/M theory) on a union of (asymptotically) AdS
spaces. One-loop effects generate a small O(1/N) mass for the gravitons and
provide non-trivial examples of massive multi-graviton theories.

to investigate stripping of a multiphase medium. The clumpy, multiphase ISM is
self-consistently produced by the inclusion of radiative cooling, and spans six
orders of magnitude in gas density. We find no large variations in the amount
of gas lost whether or not cooling is involved, although the gas in the
multiphase galaxy is stripped more quickly and to a smaller radius. We also see
significant differences in the morphology of the stripped disks. This occurs
because the multiphase medium naturally includes high density clouds set inside
regions of lower density. We find that the lower density gas is stripped
quickly from any radius of the galaxy, and the higher density gas can then be
ablated. If high density clouds survive, through interaction with the ICM they
lose enough angular momentum to drift towards the center of the galaxy where
they are no longer stripped. Finally, we find that low ram pressure values
compress gas into high density clouds that could lead to enhanced star
formation, while high ram pressure leads to a smaller amount of high-density

detection efficiency, which implies a total population far larger than these
dozen discoveries. We combine a dynamical model for the CDM sub-halo population
with simple, physically motivated prescriptions for assigning stellar content
to each sub-halo, then apply observational selection effects and compare to the
current observational census. As expected, models in which the stellar mass is
a constant fraction F(Omega_b/Omega_m) of the sub-halo mass M_sat at the time
it becomes a satellite fail for any choice of F. However, previously advocated
models that invoke suppression of gas accretion after reionization in halos
with circular velocity v_c <~ 35 km/s can reproduce the observed satellite
counts for -15 < M_V < 0, with F ~ 10^{-3}. Successful models also require
strong suppression of star formation BEFORE reionization in halos with v_c <~
10 km/s; models without pre-reionization suppression predict far too many
satellites with -5 < M_V < 0. Our models also reproduce the observed stellar
velocity dispersions ~ 5-10 km/s of the SDSS dwarfs given the observed sizes of
their stellar distributions, and model satellites have M(<300 pc) ~ 10^7 M_sun
as observed even though their present day total halo masses span more than two
orders of magnitude. Our modeling shows that natural physical mechanisms acting
within the CDM framework can quantitatively explain the properties of the MW
satellite population as it is presently known, thus providing a convincing
solution to the `missing satellite' problem.

essentially no information about the message, while knowledge of the entire
encoding reveals the message using the decoder. In this paper we study the
notion of efficiently invertible extractors and show that a wiretap protocol
can be constructed from such an extractor. We will then construct invertible
extractors for symbol-fixing, affine, and general sources and apply them to
create wiretap protocols with asymptotically optimal trade-offs between their
rate (ratio of the length of the message versus its encoding) and resilience
(ratio of the observed positions of the encoding and the length of the
encoding). We will then apply our results to create wiretap protocols for
challenging communication problems, such as active intruders who change
portions of the encoding, network coding, and intruders observing arbitrary
boolean functions of the encoding.
  As a by-product of our constructions we obtain new explicit extractors for a
restricted family of affine sources over large fields (that in particular
generalizes the notion of symbol-fixing sources) which is of independent
interest. These extractors are able to extract the entire source entropy with
zero error.

the Jain states at filling $\frac{k}{2k+1}$: they are a direct product of a
Vandermonde determinant (which has to exist for any fermionic state) and a
bosonic polynomial at filling $\frac{k}{k+1}$ which vanishes when $k+1$
particles cluster together. We show that all Jain states satisfy a ""squeezing
rule"" (they are ""squeezed polynomials"") which severely reduces the dimension of
the Hilbert space necessary to generate them. The squeezing rule also proves
the clustering conditions that these states satisfy. We compute the topological
entanglement spectrum of the Jain $\nu={2/5}$ state and compare it to both the
Coulomb ground-state and the non-unitary Gaffnian state. All three states have
very similar ""low energy"" structure. However, the Jain state entanglement
""edge"" state counting matches both the Coulomb counting as well as two
decoupled U(1) free bosons, whereas the Gaffnian edge counting misses some of
the ""edge"" states of the Coulomb spectrum. The spectral decomposition as well
as the edge structure is evidence that the Jain state is universally equivalent
to the ground state of the Coulomb Hamiltonian at $\nu={2/5}$. The evidence is
much stronger than usual overlap studies which cannot meaningfully
differentiate between the Jain and Gaffnian states. We compute the entanglement
gap and present evidence that it remains constant in the thermodynamic limit.
We also analyze the dependence of the entanglement gap and overlap as we drive
the composite fermion system through a phase transition.

Bonnor-Ebert spheres in rigid rotation. The core mass and initial radius are
held fixed at M_O=6.1 M_sun and R_O=17,000 AU, and the only parameter that we
vary is the initial angular speed \Omega_O. Protostellar discs forming from
cores with \Omega_O<1.35 10d-13 1/s have radii between 100 and 300 AU and are
quite centrally concentrated; due to heating by gas infall onto the disc and
accretion onto the central object, they are also quite warm, T>100 K, and
therefore stable against gravitational fragmentation. In contrast, more rapidly
rotating cores form discs which are less concentrated and cooler, and have
radii between 400 and 1000 AU; as a consequence they are prone to gravitational
fragmentation and the formation of multiple systems. We derive a criterion that
predicts whether a rigidly rotating core having given M_O, R_O and \Omega_O
will produce a protostellar disc which fragments whilst material is still
infalling from the core envelope. We then apply this criterion to core samples
for which M_O, R_O and \Omega_O have been estimated observationally. We
conclude that the observed cores are stable against fragmentation at this
stage, due to their low angular speeds and the heat delivered at the accretion
shock where the infalling material hits the disc.

widely separated companion within 5,000 AU are not more likely to have a close

25,000 AU are much more likely to have a close companion. Most importantly,
every target with a close companion has another YSO within a projected
separation of 25,000 AU. We came to the same conclusions after considering a
restricted sample of targets within 500 pc and close companions wider than 50
AU to minimize incompleteness effects. The Orion star forming region was found
to have an excess of both close binaries and YSOs within 25,000 AU compared to

that many close Class I binary stars form via ejections and that many of the
ejected stars become unbound during the Class I phase.

Our Chandra observation of the system yields a total X-ray luminosity of 2.4 x
10^45 erg/s (0.1-2.4 keV) and a global gas temperature of (11.6 +/- 0.7) keV,
very high values typical of MACS clusters. In both optical and X-ray images
MACSJ1206 appears close to relaxed in projection, with a pronounced X-ray peak
at the location of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG); we interpret this
feature as the remnant of a cold core. A spectacular giant gravitational arc,
15"" in length, bright (V~21) and unusually red (R-K=4.3), is seen 20"" west of
the BCG; we measure a redshift of z=1.036 for the lensed galaxy. From our HST
image of the cluster we identify the giant arc and its counter image as a
seven-fold imaged system. An excess of X-ray emission in the direction of the
arc coincides with a mild galaxy overdensity and could be the remnant of a
minor merger with a group of galaxies. We derive estimates of the total cluster
mass as well as of the mass of the cluster core using X-ray, dynamical, and
gravitational-lensing techniques. For the mass enclosed by the giant arc (r<119
kpc) our strong-lensing analysis based on HST imaging yields a very high value
of 1.1 x 10^14 M_sun, inconsistent with the much lower X-ray estimate of 0.5 x
10^14 M_sun. Similarly, the virial estimate of 4 x 10^15 M_sun for the total
cluster mass, derived from multi-object spectroscopy of 38 cluster members, is
significantly higher than the corresponding X-ray estimate of 1.7 x 10^15

along the line of sight during an ongoing merger event, an interpretation that
is supported by the system's very high velocity dispersion of 1580 km/s.

practical digital systems deal with discretized signals, we motivate the
importance of the total number of accurate bits needed from the measurement
outcomes in addition to the number of measurements. It is shown that if one
uses a $2k \times n$ Vandermonde matrix with roots on the unit circle as the
measurement matrix, $O(\ell + k \log(n/k))$ bits of precision per measurement
are sufficient to reconstruct a $k$-sparse signal $x \in \R^n$ with dynamic
range (i.e., the absolute ratio between the largest and the smallest nonzero
coefficients) at most $2^\ell$ within $\ell$ bits of precision, hence
identifying its correct support. Finally, we obtain an upper bound on the total
number of required bits when the measurement matrix satisfies a restricted
isometry property, which is in particular the case for random Fourier and
Gaussian matrices. For very sparse signals, the upper bound on the number of
required bits for Vandermonde matrices is shown to be better than this general

uniform description of spectral energy distribution of these two classes of

parameter which we define as a slope of a nominal power law function between 3
and 20 keV. We show that this parameter can be treated as an equivalent of the
X-ray loudness, alpha_OX, used to describe AGN spectra. We do not find linear
correlation between the alpha_GBH and disc flux (similar to that between
alpha_OX and optical/UV luminosity found in AGN). Instead, we show that
alpha_GBH follows a well defined pattern during a GBH outburst. We find that
alpha_GBH tend to cluster around 1, 1.5 and 2, which correspond to a hard, very
high/intermediate and soft spectral state, respectively. We conclude that
majority of the observed Type 1 radio quiet AGN are in a spectral state
corresponding to a very high/intermediate state of GBHs. The same conclusion is
valid for radio loud AGN. We also study variations of the spectral slopes
(alpha_GBH and the X-ray photon index, Gamma) as a function of disc and
Comptonization fluxes. We discuss these dependencies in the context of
correlations of alpha_OX and Gamma with the optical/UV and X-ray 2 keV fluxes

piecewise smooth containing sharp changes. The weighted essentially
nonoscillatory (WENO) scheme is suitable to handle this problem, as this
algorithm has been found to be highly stable and robust for solving Boltzmann
equation. We test this numerical solver against analytic solutions of the
evolution of the photon distribution in rest background, analytic solution in
expanding background without resonant scattering and formation of local
Boltzmann distribution around the resonant frequency with the temperature same
as that of atom for recoil. We find that evolution of photon distribution
undergoes three phases; profile is similar to the initial one, a flat plateau
(without recoil) or local Boltzmann distribution (with recoil) forms around the
resonant frequency, and finally the distribution around the resonant frequency
is saturated when the photons from the source is balanced by the redshift of
the expansion. This result indicates that the onset of the W-F coupling should
not be determined by the third phase, but by the time scale of the second
phase. We found that the time scale of the W-F coupling is equal to about a few
hundreds of the mean free flight time of photons with resonant frequency, and
is independent of the Sobolev parameter if this parameter is much less than 1.

the resulting changes in the means and standard deviations of decision times,
we show that, for high signal-to-noise ratios, drift-diffusion models with

Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, but not necessarily from each other. The

of Oldroyd-B fluids is studied from an input-output point of view by analyzing
the responses of the velocity components to spatio-temporal body forces. These
inputs into the governing equations are assumed to be harmonic in the spanwise
direction and stochastic in the wall-normal direction and in time. An explicit
Reynolds number scaling of frequency responses from different forcing to
different velocity components is developed, showing the same $Re$-dependence as
in Newtonian fluids. It is found that some of the frequency response components
peak at non-zero temporal frequencies. This is in contrast to Newtonian fluids,
where peaks are always observed at zero frequency, suggesting that viscoelastic
effects introduce additional timescales and promote development of flow
patterns with smaller time constants than in Newtonian fluids. The temporal
frequencies, corresponding to the peaks in the components of frequency
response, decrease with an increase in viscosity ratio (ratio of solvent
viscosity to total viscosity) and show maxima for non-zero elasticity number.
Our analysis of the Reynolds-Orr equation demonstrates that the energy-exchange
term involving the streamwise/wall-normal polymer stress component $\tau_{xy}$
and the wall-normal gradient of the streamwise velocity $\partial_y u$ becomes
increasingly important relative to the Reynolds stress term as the elasticity
number increases, and is thus the main driving force for amplification in flows
with strong viscoelastic effects.

dependence of light scattering properties on wavelength, cluster size and
porosity using these aggregate models. We find that while the shape of the
phase function depends mainly on the size parameter of the aggregates, the
linear polarization depends on both the size parameter and the porosity of the
aggregates, with increasing degree of polarization as the porosity increases.
Contrary to previous studies, we argue that monomer size has negligible effects
on the light scattering properties of ballistic aggregates, as long as the
constituent monomer is smaller than the incident wavelength up to
2*pi*a_0/lambda\sim 1.6 where a_0 is the monomer radius. Previous claims for
such monomer size effects are in fact the combined effects of size parameter
and porosity. Finally, we present aggregate models that can reproduce the phase

from cometary dust, including the negative polarization observed for comets at

iterative spectrum shaping (ISS), for the multi-carrier-based multiuser
communication system, where two coexisting users independently and sequentially
update transmit power allocations over parallel subcarriers to maximize their
individual transmit rates. Unlike the conventional iterative water-filling
(IWF) algorithm that applies the single-user detection (SD) at each user's
receiver by treating the interference from the other user as additional noise,
the proposed ISS algorithm applies multiuser detection techniques to decode
both the desired user's and interference user's messages if it is feasible,
thus termed as opportunistic multiuser detection (OMD). Two encoding methods
are considered for ISS: One is carrier independent encoding where independent
codewords are modulated by different subcarriers for which different decoding
methods can be applied; the other is carrier joint encoding where a single
codeword is modulated by all the subcarriers for which a single decoder is
applied. For each encoding method, this paper presents the associated optimal
user power and rate allocation strategy at each iteration of transmit
adaptation. It is shown that under many circumstances the proposed ISS
algorithm employing OMD is able to achieve substantial throughput gains over
the conventional IWF algorithm employing SD for decentralized spectrum sharing.
Applications of ISS in cognitive radio communication systems are also

Kaluza-Klein spacetime due the the vacuum fluctuation of massless scalar field
with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We consider the general case where the
extra dimensions (internal space) can be any compact connected manifold or
orbifold without boundaries. Using piston analysis, we show that the Casimir
force is always attractive at any temperature, regardless of the geometry of
the internal space. Moreover, the magnitude of the Casimir force increases as
the size of the internal space increases and it reduces to the Casimir force in
(3+1)-dimensional Minskowski spacetime when the size of the internal space
shrinks to zero. In the other extreme where the internal space is large, the
Casimir force can increase beyond all bound. Asymptotic behaviors of the
Casimir force in the low and high temperature regimes are derived and it is
observed that the magnitude of the Casimir force grows linearly with
temperature in the high temperature regime.

capture rate with a target of gallium metal in Dec. 1989. Measurements have
continued with only a few brief interruptions since that time. We give here the
experimental improvements in SAGE since its last published data summary in Dec.
2001. Assuming the solar neutrino production rate was constant during the
period of data collection, combined analysis of 168 extractions through Dec.
2007 gives a capture rate of solar neutrinos with energy more than 233 keV of
65.4 (+3.1)(-3.0) (stat) (+2.6)(-2.8) (syst) SNU. The weighted average of the
results of all three Ga solar neutrino experiments, SAGE, Gallex, and GNO, is
now 66.1 +/- 3.1 SNU, where statistical and systematic uncertainties have been
combined in quadrature. During the recent period of data collection a new test
of SAGE was made with a reactor-produced 37Ar neutrino source. The ratio of
observed to calculated rates in this experiment, combined with the measured
rates in the three prior 51Cr neutrino-source experiments with Ga, is 0.87 +/-
0.05. A probable explanation for this low result is that the cross section for
neutrino capture by the two lowest-lying excited states in 71Ge has been
overestimated. If we assume these cross sections are zero, then the standard
solar model including neutrino oscillations predicts a total capture rate in Ga
in the range of 63-66 SNU with an uncertainty of about 4%, in good agreement
with experiment. We derive the current value of the neutrino flux produced in
the Sun by the proton-proton fusion reaction to be (6.0 +/- 0.8) x
10^(10)/(cm^2 s), which agrees well with the pp flux predicted by the standard
solar model. Finally, we show that the data are consistent with the assumption
that the solar neutrino production rate is constant in time.

survey. Using a new diagnostic tool based on X-ray column density measurements
vs softness ratios, Malizia et al. (2007) identified this source as a candidate
Compton thick AGN. In the present work we have analysed combined XMM-Newton and
INTEGRAL data of IGR J16351-5806 in order to study its broad band spectrum and
investigate its Compton thick nature. The prominent K_alpha fluorescence line
around 6.4 keV (EW > 1 keV) together with a flat 2-10 keV spectrum immediately
point to a highly obscured source. The overall spectrum can be interpreted in
terms of a transmission scenario where some of the high energy radiation is
able to penetrate through the thick absorption but a good fit is also obtained
using a pure reflection spectrum. An alternative possibility is that of a
complex absorption, where two layers of absorbing matter each partially
covering the central nucleus are present in IGR J16351-5806. All three
scenarios are compatible from a statistical viewpoint and provide reasonable
AGN spectral parameters; more importantly all point to a source with an
absorbing column greater than 1.5 x 10^24 cm^-2, i.e. to a Compton thick AGN.
Because of this heavy obscuration, some extra components which would otherwise
be hidden are able to emerge at low energies and can be studied. By providing
strong evidence for the Compton thick nature of IGR J16351-5806, we indirectly
confirm the validity of the Malizia et al. diagnostic diagram.

immunobiology, namely, the discrimination of foreign antigens against a
background of the body's own molecules. The precise mechanism of this
foreign-self-distinction, though one of the major tasks of the immune system,
continues to be a fundamental puzzle. Recent progress has been made by van den
Berg, Rand, and Burroughs (2001), who modelled the \emph{probabilistic} nature
of the interaction between the relevant cell types, namely, T-cells and
antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Here, the stochasticity is due to the random
sample of antigens present on the surface of every APC, and to the random
receptor type that characterises individual T-cells. It has been shown
previously that this model, though highly idealised, is capable of reproducing
important aspects of the recognition phenomenon, and of explaining them on the
basis of stochastic rare events. These results were obtained with the help of a
refined large deviation theorem and were thus asymptotic in nature. Simulations
have, so far, been restricted to the straightforward simple sampling approach,
which does not allow for sample sizes large enough to address more detailed
questions. Building on the available large deviation results, we develop an
importance sampling technique that allows for a convenient exploration of the
relevant tail events by means of simulation. With its help, we investigate the
mechanism of statistical recognition in some depth. In particular, we
illustrate how a foreign antigen can stand out against the self background if
it is present in sufficiently many copies, although no \emph{a priori}
difference between self and nonself is built into the model.

limited to a few cases because for many realistic population genetic models the

with the advent of likelihood-free inference algorithms, often subsumed under

of a post-sampling regression adjustment, allowing larger tolerance values and
as such shifting computation time to realistic orders of magnitude (see
Beaumont et al., 2002). Here we propose a reformulation of the regression
adjustment in terms of a General Linear Model (GLM). This allows the
integration into the framework of Bayesian statistics and the use of its

Using vector autoregressive (VAR) models, these can be defined based on

most cases a parsimonious causality structure is assumed, a promising approach
to causal discovery consists in fitting VAR models with an additional
sparsity-promoting regularization. Along this line we here propose that
sparsity should be enforced for the subgroups of coefficients that belong to
each pair of time series, as the absence of a causal relation requires the
coefficients for all time-lags to become jointly zero. Such behavior can be
achieved by means of l1-l2-norm regularized regression, for which an efficient
active set solver has been proposed recently. Our method is shown to outperform
standard methods in recovering simulated causality graphs. The results are on
par with a second novel approach which uses multiple statistical testing.

structure responsible for bursty and intermittent events driving the PDF tails.
It is found that stronger zonal flows are generated in ITG turbulence than
Hasegawa-Mima (HM) turbulence as well as further from marginal stability. This
suggests that although ITG turbulence has a higher level of heat flux, it also
more likely generates stronger zonal flows, leading to a self-regulating
system. It is also shown that shear flows can significantly reduce the PDF
tails of Reynolds stress and structure formation.

orders of magnitude. We analyzed nine XMM-Newton observations of XTE J1810-197
collected over a four years baseline (September 2003 - September 2007). EPIC PN

Pulse phase spectroscopic studies were also carried out for observations with
sufficiently high signal to noise. We find that: (i) a three blackbodies model
reproduces the spectral properties of the source over the entire outburst
statistically better than the two blackbodies model previously used in the
literature, (ii) the coldest blackbody is consistent with the thermal emission
from the whole surface, and has temperature and radius similar to those
inferred from ROSAT observations before the outburst onset, (iii) there is a
spectral feature around 1.1 keV during six consecutive observations (since
March 2005); if due to proton resonant cyclotron scattering, it would imply a
magnetic field of around 2E14 G. This is in a very good agreement with the

magnetoresistance (MR). Two additional phenomena in this family have also drawn
attention: the metal-insulator transition (MIT) and electroresistance (ER). The
MIT is revealed by measuring resistance as a function of temperature, and
observing a change in the sign of the gradient. ER - the dependence of the
resistance on applied current - is revealed by measuring resistance as a
function of applied current. Up until now, the phenomena of MIT and ER have
been treated separately. Here we report simultaneous observation of the MIT and

voltage-current curves over a wide temperature range (10-300 K) allowing us to
build up an experimental voltage surface over current-temperature axes. These

We show how the theory of CMV matrices gives a natural tool to study these

McGregor developed to study (classical) birth-and-death processes using
orthogonal polynomials on the real line. In perfect analogy with the classical
case the study of QRWs on the set of non-negative integers can be handled using
scalar valued (Laurent) polynomials and a scalar valued measure on the circle.
In the case of classical or quantum random walks on the integers one needs to
allow for matrix valued versions of these notions. We show how our tools yield
results in the well known case of the Hadamard walk, but we go beyond this
translation invariant model to analyze examples that are hard to analyze using
other methods. More precisely we consider QRWs on the set of non- negative
integers. The analysis of these cases leads to phenomena that are absent in the
case of QRWs on the integers even if one restricts oneself to a constant coin.
This is illustrated here by studying recurrence properties of the walk, but the

The stopping power for an ion is calculated employing linear response theory

of plasmons and quasiparticles in the electron gas, is taken into account
through a relaxation time approximation in the linear response function. The
stopping power for an ion is calculated in both the low- and high-velocity

well-defined approach of Bogoliubov, Parasuk, Hepp, and Zimmermann (BPHZ),

simplification of the techniques of perturbation theory, and which applies
equally well to standard quantum field theory and to chiral theories. We
illustrate the proposed method by a number of examples of various orders in
perturbation theory. At the level of multi-loop diagrams we find that
subdiagrams as classified by Zimmermann's forest formula in BPHZ may be
restricted to subdiagrams in the sense of Epstein-Glaser, thus entailing an
important reduction of actual computations. Furthermore, the relationship of
our approach to the method of dimensional regularization is particularly
transparent, without having to invoke analytic continuation to unphysical
spacetime dimension, and sheds new light on certain parameters within

solution composed of two solvents (binary mixture), the osmotic pressure
between charged macromolecules is affected by the binary solvent composition.
By adding local solvent composition terms to the free energy, we obtain a
general expression for the osmotic pressure, in planar geometry and within the
mean-field framework. The added effect is due to the permeability inhomogeneity
and nonelectrostatic short-range interactions between the ions and solvents
(preferential solvation). This effect is mostly pronounced at small distances
and leads to a reduction in the osmotic pressure for macromolecular separations
of the order 1--2 nm. Furthermore, it leads to a depletion of one of the two
solvents from the charged macromolecules (modeled as planar interfaces).
Lastly, by comparing the theoretical results with experimental ones, an
explanation based on preferential solvation is offered for recent experiments
on the osmotic pressure of DNA solutions.

standard picture in which the accretion disk is truncated at large radii in the
low/hard state. We tested a number of spectral models and we found that several
of them fit the observed spectra without the need of a soft disk-like
component. This result implies that the classical paradigm of a truncated
accretion disk in the low/hard state can not be ruled out by these data. We
further discovered a broad iron emission line between 6 and 7 keV in these

Ricci dark energy proposed by Gao et al. [Phys. Rev. D 79, 043511 (2009)], by
using the observational data currently available. The main characteristic of
holographic Ricci dark energy is governed by a positive numerical parameter
$\alpha$ in the model. When $\alpha<1/2$, the holographic Ricci dark energy
will exhibit a quintomlike behavior; i.e., its equation of state will evolve
across the cosmological-constant boundary $w=-1$. The parameter $\alpha$ can be
determined only by observations. Thus, in order to characterize the evolving
feature of dark energy and to predict the fate of the universe, it is of
extraordinary importance to constrain the parameter $\alpha$ by using the
observational data. In this paper, we derive constraints on the holographic
Ricci dark energy model from the latest observational data including the Union
sample of 307 type Ia supernovae, the shift parameter of the cosmic microwave
background given by the five-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe
observations, and the baryon acoustic oscillation measurement from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey. The joint analysis gives the best-fit results (with
1$\sigma$ uncertainty): $\alpha=0.359^{+0.024}_{-0.025}$ and $\Omega_{\rm
m0}=0.318^{+0.026}_{-0.024}$. That is to say, according to the observations,
the holographic Ricci dark energy takes on the quintom feature. Finally, in
light of the results of the cosmological constraints, we discuss the issue of
the scalar-field dark energy reconstruction, based on the scenario of the
holographic Ricci vacuum energy.

We provide a
simple semi-analytic model for the corotation region, which is subsequently
compared to high resolution numerical simulations. The model is used to derive
an expression for the half-width of the horseshoe region, x_s, which in the
limit of zero softening is given by x_s/r_p = 1.68(q/h)^(1/2), where q is the
planet to central star mass ratio, h is the disc aspect ratio and r_p the
orbital radius. This is in very good agreement with the same quantity measured
from simulations. This result is used to show that horseshoe drag is about an
order of magnitude larger than the linear corotation torque in the zero
softening limit. Thus the horseshoe drag, the sign of which depends on the
gradient of specific vorticity, is important for estimates of the total torque
acting on the planet. We further show that phenomena, such as the Lindblad
wakes, with a radial separation from corotation of ~ a pressure scale height H
can affect x_s, even though for low-mass planets x_s << H. The effect is to
distort streamlines and to reduce x_s through the action of a back pressure.
This effect is reduced for smaller gravitational softening parameters and
planets of higher mass, for which x_s becomes comparable to H.

embedded in a protoplanetary disc in the isothermal limit. For low mass
protoplanets and large viscosity the corotation torque behaves as expected from
linear theory. However, when the viscosity becomes small enough to enable
horseshoe turns to occur, the linear corotation torque exists only temporarily
after insertion of a planet into the disc, being replaced by the horseshoe drag
first discussed by Ward. This happens after a time that is equal to the
horseshoe libration period reduced by a factor amounting to about twice the
disc aspect ratio. This torque scales with the radial gradient of specific
vorticity, as does the linear torque, but we find it to be many times larger.
If the viscosity is large enough for viscous diffusion across the coorbital
region to occur within a libration period, we find that the horseshoe drag may
be sustained. If not, the corotation torque saturates leaving only the linear
Lindblad torques. As the magnitude of the non linear coorbital torque
(horseshoe drag) is always found to be larger than the linear torque, we find
that the sign of the total torque may change even for for mildly positive
surface density gradients. In combination with a kinematic viscosity large
enough to keep the torque from saturating, strong sustained deviations from
linear theory and outward or stalled migration may occur in such cases

imaging techniques, operated separately. With the development of modern
technologies it is possible to obtain datacubes in which one combines both
techniques simultaneously, producing images with spectral resolution. To
extract information from them can be quite complex, and hence the development
of new methods of data analysis is desirable. We present a method of analysis
of datacube (data from single field observations, containing two spatial and
one spectral dimension) that uses PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to express
the data in the form of reduced dimensionality, facilitating efficient
information extraction from very large data sets. PCA transforms the system of
correlated coordinates into a system of uncorrelated coordinates ordered by
principal components of decreasing variance. The new coordinates are referred
to as eigenvectors, and the projections of the data onto these coordinates
produce images we will call tomograms. The association of the tomograms
(images) to eigenvectors (spectra) is important for the interpretation of both.
The eigenvectors are mutually orthogonal and this information is fundamental
for their handling and interpretation. When the datacube shows objects that
present uncorrelated physical phenomena, the eigenvector's orthogonality may be
instrumental in separating and identifying them. By handling eigenvectors and
tomograms one can enhance features, extract noise, compress data, extract
spectra, etc. We applied the method, for illustration purpose only, to the
central region of the LINER galaxy NGC 4736, and demonstrate that it has a type
1 active nucleus, not known before. Furthermore we show that it is displaced

the case of two coordinated source nodes, as introduced in the seminal work of
Bergmans and Cover in 1974. A scheme is introduced for two classes of
destination (or relay) nodes: Close nodes and far nodes, as ranked by their
spatial distances to the pair of transmitting nodes. Two linear codes are
combined using the (u,u+v)-construction devised by Plotkin to construct
two-level linear unequal error protection (LUEP) codes. However, instead of
binary addition of subcode codewords in the source encoder, here modulated
subcode sequences are combined at the destination (or relay) nodes antennae.
Bergmans and Cover referred to this as over-the-air mixing. In the case of
Rayleigh fading, additional diversity order as well as robustness to channel
estimation errors are obtained when source nodes transmit pairs of coded
sequences in accordance to Alamouti's transmit diversity scheme. We refer to
this combination as a Plotkin-Alamouti scheme and study its performance over
AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels with a properly partitioned QPSK
constellation.

similar for all the knots, but lower than previously reported in the literature

is remarkably constant over the ring, indicating that local polution processes

young population with less than 10 Myr, responsible for the ionisation of the

the implied volatility (corresponding to at-the-money option with expiry at

ARCH processes. The forecasts are derived from the process equations, and the
parameters set a priori. An empirical analysis across multiple time horizons DT
shows that a forecast provided by an I-GARCH(1) process (1 time scale) does not
capture correctly the dynamic of the realized volatility. An I-GARCH(2) process
(2 time scales, similar to GARCH(1,1)) is better, while a long memory LM-ARCH
process (multiple time scales) replicates correctly the dynamic of the realized
volatility and delivers consistently good forecast for the implied volatility.
The relationship between market models for the forward variance and the
volatility forecasts provided by ARCH processes is investigated. The structure
of the forecast equations is identical, but with different coefficients. Yet
the process equations for the variance are very different (postulated for a
market model, induced by the process equations for an ARCH model), and not of
any usual diffusive type when derived from ARCH.

eigenvarieties for connected reductive algebraic groups G whose real points are
compact modulo centre, extending earlier constructions due to Buzzard,
Chenevier and Yamagami for forms of GL(n). This leads to some new phenomena,
including the appearance of intermediate spaces of ""semi-classical"" automorphic
forms; this gives a hierarchy of interpolation spaces (eigenvarieties)
interpolating classical automorphic forms satisfying different finite slope
conditions (corresponding to a choice of parabolic subgroup of G at p). The
construction of these spaces relies on methods of locally analytic
representation theory, combined with the theory of compact operators on Banach
modules.

Systems in contact with heat baths at two different temperatures or subject to
external driving will be studied. In the first case, by considering different
kinetic rules and couplings with the baths, the behavior of the probability
distributions of the heat exchanged in a time $\tau$ with the thermostats, both
in the disordered and in the low temperature phase, are discussed. The
fluctuation relation is always verified in the large $\tau $ limit and
deviations from linear response theory are observed. Finite-$\tau$ corrections
are shown to obey a scaling behavior. In the other case the system is in
contact with a single heat bath but work is done by shearing it. Also for this
system the statistics collected for the mechanical work shows the validity of
the fluctuation relation and preasymptotic corrections behave analogously to
the case with two baths.

topological charge density is more fragmented, when dynamical quarks are

of vibrations, results, for the same density, in a much smaller coordination
number z, as small as in much looser systems. Upon varying the confining
pressure P, simulations show a very nearly reversible variation of density,
while z is irreversibly changed in a pressure cycle. Elastic moduli are shown
to be mainly related to the coordination number. Their P dependence notably
departs from predictions of simple homogenization approaches in the case of the

that the mesoscopic nuclear spin ensemble of a quantum dot (QD) can in general
not be described by a spin temperature. We associate the observed deviations
from a thermal spin state with the presence of strong quadrupolar interactions
within the QD that cause significant anharmonicity in the spectrum of the
nuclear spins. Strain-induced, inhomogeneous quadrupolar shifts also lead to a
complete suppression of angular momentum exchange between the nuclear spin
ensemble and its environment, resulting in nuclear spin relaxation times
exceeding an hour. Remarkably, the position dependent axes of quadrupolar
interactions render magnetic field sweeps inherently non-adiabatic, thereby
causing an irreversible loss of nuclear spin polarization.
