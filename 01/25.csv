  to finite-strain elasticity","9 pages",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We develop a computational method based on an Eulerian field called the
""reference map"", which relates the current location of a material point to its
initial. The reference map can be discretized to permit finite-difference
simulation of large solid-like deformations, in any dimension, of the type that
might otherwise require the finite element method. The generality of the method
stems from its ability to easily compute kinematic quantities essential to
solid mechanics, that are elusive outside of Lagrangian frame. This
introductory work focuses on large-strain, hyperelastic materials. After a
brief review of hyperelasticity, a discretization of the method is presented
and some non-trivial elastic deformations are simulated, both static and
dynamic. The method's accuracy is directly verified against known analytical
solutions.

emission selected galaxies at z~3 by probing the faint end of the luminosity
function of star-forming galaxies at z~3. We have performed narrow-band imaging
in three fields with intervening QSO absorbers (a damped Ly$\alpha$ absorber
and two Lyman-limit systems) using the VLT. We target Ly-alpha at redshifts
2.85, 3.15 and 3.20. We find a consistent surface density of about 10
Ly-alpha-emitters per square arcmin per unit redshift in all three fields down
to our detection limit of about 3x10^41 ergs s^-1. The luminosity function is
consistent with what has been found by other surveys at similar redshifts.
About 85% of the sources are fainter than the canonical limit of R=25.5 for
most Lyman-break galaxy surveys. In none of the three fields do we detect the
emission counterparts of the QSO absorbers. In particular we do not detect the
counterpart of the z=2.85 damped Ly-alpha absorber towards Q2138-4427.
Narrow-band surveys for Ly-alpha emitters are excellent to probe the faint end
of the luminosity function at z~3. There is a very high surface density of this
class of objects. This is consistent with a very steep slope of the faint end
of the luminosity function as has been inferred by other studies. This faint
population of galaxies is playing a central role in the early Universe. There
is evidence that this population is dominating the integrated star-formation
activity, responsible for the bulk of the ionizing photons at z~3 and likely
also responsible for the bulk of the enrichment of the intergalactic medium.

  In the SMC, we find a population of slowly rotating nitrogen-rich stars
amongst the early B type core-hydrogen burning stars, similar to the LMC. In
the Galactic sample we find no significant enrichment amongst the core
hydrogen-burning stars, which appears to be in contrast with the expectation
from both rotating single-star and close binary evolution models. However, only
a small number of the rapidly rotating stars have evolved enough to produce a
significant nitrogen enrichment, and these may be analogous to the non-enriched
rapid rotators previously found in the LMC sample. Finally, in each metallicity
regime, a population of highly enriched supergiants is observed, which cannot
be the immediate descendants of core-hydrogen burning stars. Their abundances
are, however, compatible with them having gone through a previous red
supergiant phase. Together, these observations paint a complex picture of the
nitrogen enrichment in massive main sequence and supergiant stellar
atmospheres, where age and binarity cause crucial effects. Whether rotational
mixing is required to understand our results remains an open question at this

enabled the use of remote sensing techniques to study the composition of the
Venus atmosphere below the clouds. In particular, water vapor absorption lines
can be observed in a number of the near-infrared windows allowing measurement
of the H2O abundance at several different levels in the lower atmosphere.
Accurate determination of the abundance requires a good database of spectral
line parameters for the H2O absorption lines at the high temperatures (up to
~700 K) encountered in the Venus deep atmosphere. This paper presents a
comparison of a number of H2O line lists that have been, or that could
potentially be used, to analyze Venus deep atmosphere water abundances and
shows that there are substantial discrepancies between them. For example, the
early high-temperature list used by Meadows and Crisp (1996) had large
systematic errors in line intensities. When these are corrected for using the
more recent high-temperature BT2 list of Barber et al. (2006) their value of
45+/-10 ppm for the water vapor mixing ratio reduces to 27+/-6 ppm. The HITRAN
and GEISA lists used for most other studies of Venus are deficient in ""hot""
lines that become important in the Venus deep atmosphere and also show evidence
of systematic errors in line intensities, particularly for the 8000 to 9500
cm-1 region that includes the 1.18 um window. Water vapor mixing ratios derived
from these lists may also be somewhat overestimated. The BT2 line list is
recommended as being the most complete and accurate current representation of
the H2O spectrum at Venus temperatures.

density plasma, it will be absorbed resonantly as long as it is polarized in
the plane of incidence and has an electric field component along the plasma
electron density gradient. This process takes place by linear mode conversion
into an electron plasma wave. In this paper, we have considered the resonant
absorption of laser light near the critical density of a plasma with linear
electron density profile. The behaviour of the electric and magnetic vectors of
a laser light propagating through inhomogeneous plasma has been studied by
calculating them using Maxwell's equations using a new semi-analytical model.
The absorbed fraction of the laser light energy, then, evaluated and plotted
versus the angle of incidence. It has been shown that this new model can
explain the previous classical approximated results at high density scale
lengths as well as the reported numerical results in almost all density scale
lengths.

found that for some interaction terms and for certain values of the couplings,
supersymmetry is unbroken for small lengths of the compact radius, and breaks
dynamically as the radius increases. Also for another class of interaction
terms, when the radius is large supersymmetry is unbroken and breaks
dynamically as the radius decreases. It is pointed out that the two phenomena
have similarities with the theory of metastable vacua at finite temperature and
with the inverse symmetry breaking of continuous symmetries at finite
