electron-positron annihilation at zero temperature in a strongly coupled,
large-Nc SU(Nc) field theory with Nf << Nc quark flavors. The resulting
expressions are valid to leading order in the electromagnetic coupling constant
but non-perturbatively in the SU(Nc) interactions and the mass of the quark. We
obtain this quantity by computing the imaginary part of the hadronic vacuum
polarization function Pi_q using holographic techniques, providing an
alternative to the known method that uses the spectrum of infinitely stable
mesons determined by the normalizable modes of the appropriated fields in the
bulk. Our result exhibits a structure of poles localized at specific real
values of q^2, which coincide with the ones found using the normalizable modes,
and extends it offering the unique analytic continuation of this distribution
to a function defined for values of q^2 over the complex plane. This analytic
continuation permits to include a finite decay width for the mesons. By
comparison with experimental data we find qualitatively good agreement on the
shape of the first pole, when using the rho meson parameters and choosing a
proper normalization factor. We then estimate the contribution to the anomalous
magnetic moment of the muon finding an agreement within 25%, for this choice of
parameters.

unconfined flow has an inefficient conversion of magnetic energy to kinetic
energy. This has led to the conclusion that ideal magnetohydrodynamical (MHD)
processes fail to explain observations of, e.g., the Crab pulsar wind at large
radii where energy conversion appears efficient. In addition, as a model for
astrophysical jets, the monopole field geometry has been abandoned in favor of
externally confined jets since the latter appeared to be generically more
efficient jet accelerators. We perform time-dependent axisymmetric relativistic
MHD simulations in order to find steady state solutions for a wind from a
compact object endowed with a monopole field geometry. Our simulations follow
the outflow for 10 orders of magnitude in distance from the compact object,
which is large enough to study both the initial ""acceleration zone"" of the
magnetized wind as well as the asymptotic ""coasting zone."" We obtain the
surprising result that acceleration is actually {\it efficient} in the polar
region, which develops a jet despite not being confined by an external medium.
Our models contain jets that have sufficient energy to account for moderately
energetic long and short gamma-ray burst (GRB) events (~10^{51}--10^{52} erg),
collimate into narrow opening angles (opening half-angle \theta_j \approx 0.03

unit matter energy flux \sigma<1), and move at ultrarelativistic Lorentz
factors (\gamma_j ~ 200 for our fiducial model). (abridged)

celestial mechanics to characterize the dynamical behavior of bodies. The
stability of their orbit can be determined by the calculation of the local
exponential divergence of arbitrarily close initial conditions in phase space.
As the equations to calculate lambda are given, a straight prediction of the
orbital stability should be possible. However, one finds in the literature a
lot of discrepancies between different studies dedicated to the same object.
  As a possible explanation for this we investigated in the presented work the
effects of the used computer hardware and integration methods on the outcome of
such stability computations. Therefore we calculated the Lyapunov time of
different asteroids as a measure of chaoticity. Exploring the very fine
structure of the nearby phase space of the initial conditions, we are able to
explain the reason of the differences in the published Lyapunov times for some
objects. Applying methods of robust statistics we introduce the computability
index kappa as a measure of repeatability of the results. This kappa gives an
estimate, how much the obtained Lyapunov time will change, e.g. when repeating
the same calculations with a different integration method.

constrain the luminosity distribution of the brightest UCDs in Centaurus, we
continue our search by substantially improving our survey completeness

we obtain low-resolution spectra of 400 compact objects with 19.3<V_0<21.3 mag

cluster, which corresponds to a projected radius of ~150 kpc. Our survey yields
complete area coverage within ~120 kpc. For 94% of the sources included in the
masks we successfully measure a redshift. Due to incompleteness in the slit
assignment, our final completeness in the area surveyed is 52%. Among our
targets we find three new UCDs in the magnitude range -12.2<M_V<-12 mag, hence
at the faint limit of our survey. One of them is covered by archival HST WFPC2
imaging, yielding a size estimate of r_h <= 8-9 pc. At 95% confidence we can
reject the hypothesis that in the area surveyed there are more than 2 massive
UCDs with M_V<-12.2 mag and r_eff <=70 pc. Our survey hence confirms the
extreme rareness of massive UCDs. We find that the radial distributions of

non-spinning black-hole binaries using ground-based gravitational-wave
detectors. While past assessments were based on only the inspiral/ring-down
pieces of the coalescence signal, the recent progress in analytical and
numerical relativity enables us to make more accurate projections using
""complete"" inspiral-merger-ringdown waveforms. We employ the Fisher matrix
formalism to estimate how accurately the source parameters will be measurable
using a single interferometer as well as a network of interferometers. Those
estimates are further vetted by Monte-Carlo simulations. We find that the
parameter accuracies of the complete waveform are, in general, significantly
better than those of just the inspiral waveform in the case of binaries with
total mass M > 20 M_sun. For the case of the Advanced LIGO detector, parameter
estimation is the most accurate in the M=100-200 M_sun range. For an M=100M_sun
system, the errors in measuring the total mass and the symmetric mass-ratio are
reduced by an order of magnitude or more compared to inspiral waveforms. For
binaries located at a luminosity distance d_L and observed with the Advanced
LIGO--Advanced Virgo network, the sky-position error varies widely across the
sky: For M=100M_sun systems at d_L=1Gpc, this variation ranges from ~0.01
square-degrees to one square-degree, with an average value of ~0.1
square-degrees. This is more than forty times better than the average
sky-position accuracy of inspiral waveforms at this mass-range. The error in
estimating d_L is dominated by the error in measuring the wave's polarization
and is ~43% for low-mass binaries and ~23% for high-mass binaries located at
d_L=1Gpc.

couplings of charged matter multiplets are supposed to be generated around
codimension-3 singularity points of a base complex 3-fold, and that has been
confirmed for the simplest type of codimension-3 singularities in recent
studies. However, the geometry of F-theory compactifications is much more
complicated. For a generic F-theory compactification, such issues as flux
configuration around the codimension-3 singularities, field-theory formulation
of the local geometry and behavior of zero-mode wavefunctions have virtually
never been addressed before. We address all these issues in this article, and
further discuss nature of Yukawa couplings generated at such singularities. In
order to calculate the Yukawa couplings of low-energy effective theory,
however, the local descriptions of wavefunctions on complex surfaces and a
global characterization of zero-modes over a complex curve have to be combined
together. We found the relation between them by re-examining how chiral charged
matters are characterized in F-theory compactification. An intrinsic definition
of spectral surfaces in F-theory turns out to be the key concept. As a
biproduct, we found a new way to understand the Heterotic--F theory duality,
which improves the precision of existing duality map associated with
codimension-3 singularities.

correspondence. In planar N=4 SYM theory, its perturbative expansion at weak

an expansion in inverse powers of the 't Hooft coupling which is given by a
non-Borel summable asymptotic series. We study the cusp anomalous dimension in
the transition regime from strong to weak coupling and argue that the
transition is driven by nonperturbative, exponentially suppressed corrections.
To compute these corrections, we revisit the calculation of the cusp anomalous

addressed in the large N_c limit of SU(N_c) Yang--Mills theory. We investigate
the tree level multi-gluon components of the gluon light cone wave functions in
the light cone gauge keeping the exact kinematics of the gluon emissions. We
focus on the components with all helicities identical to the helicity of the
incoming gluon. The recurrence relations for the gluon wave functions are
derived. In the case when the virtuality of the incoming gluon is neglected the
exact form of the multi-gluon wave function is obtained. Furthermore, we
propose an approximate scheme to treat the kinematic effects in the color
dipole evolution kernel. The new kernel entangles longitudinal and transverse
degrees of freedom and leads to a reduced diffusion in the impact parameter.
When evaluated in the next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) accuracy, the kernel
reproduces the correct form of the double logarithmic terms of the dipole size
ratios present in the exact NLL dipole kernel. Finally, we analyze the
scattering of the incoming gluon light cone components off a gluon target and
the fragmentation of the scattered state into the final state. The equivalence
of the resulting amplitudes and the maximally-helicity-violating amplitudes is

that a global encoding/decoding scheme, which involves input entangled states
among different channel uses, is always preferable with respect to a local one

provide an analytical expression for the classical capacity of the channel

dN_gamma emitted by N_e electrons per bunch crossing in the energy interval
dE_gamma is dN_gamma = alpha g N_e dE_gamma/E_gamma, where alpha is the
fine-structure constant, and the function g, which depends on the bunch

for the ILC, we find that E_c = 83 keV and g=5.5 at a vanishing beam axis
displacement, and g=0.88, E_c=0.24 keV for KEKB. We also calculate the specific

baryonic matter self-consistently for the first time. We find that the addition
of baryonic physics drastically alters the dark matter profile in the vicinity
of the Solar neighbourhood. A stellar/gas disc, already in place at high
redshift, causes merging satellites to be dragged preferentially towards the
disc plane where they are torn apart by tides. This results in an accreted dark
matter disc that contributes ~0.25 - 1.5 times the non-rotating halo density at
the solar position. The dark disc, unlike dark matter streams, is an
equilibrium structure that must exist in disc galaxies that form in a
hierarchical cosmology. Its low rotation lag with respect to the Earth
significantly boosts WIMP capture in the Earth and Sun, boosts the annual
modulation signal, and leads to distinct variations in the flux as a function
of recoil energy that allow the WIMP mass to be determined.

galaxies always show a disk, a bar, and a (pseudo)bulge. Where is the
(pseudo)bulge in NGC 4565? We use archival Hubble Space Telescope K-band and
Spitzer Space Telescope 3.6 um images to penetrate the dust in NGC 4565. We
find a high surface brightness, central stellar component, distinct from the
boxy bar and from the galaxy's disk. Its minor-axis profile has a Sersic index
of 1.33+/-0.12, so it is a pseudobulge. The pseudobulge has the smallest scale
height (~90 pc) of any component in the galaxy, in contrast to ~740 pc for the
boxy bar plus thin disk. The disky pseudobulge is also much less luminous than
the boxy bar, so the true (pseudo)bulge-to-total luminosity ratio of the galaxy
is much less than previously thought. We infer that the pseudobulge-to-total
luminosity ratios of edge-on galaxies with box-shaped bulges have generally
been overestimated. Therefore more galaxies than we have recognized contain
little or no evidence of a merger-built classical bulge. This challenges our
picture of galaxy formation by hierarchical clustering, because it is difficult
to grow big galaxies without also making a big classical bulge. Solving the
puzzle of the ""missing pseudobulge"" in NGC 4565 further increases our
confidence that we understand box-shaped bulges correctly as edge-on bars. This
supports our developing picture of the formation of pseudobulges -- both
edge-on bars and disky central components -- by secular evolution in isolated
galaxies.

g and r magnitudes in the observer- and rest-frames directly from the SDSS DR6

the k-corrections from the spectra to study the evolution of the rest-frame
colour-magnitude relation (CMR) and colour-sigma (velocity dispersion) relation
(CsigmaR). The evolution is very sensitive to the k-correction. Both the CMR
and CsigmaR evolve blueward with increasing redshift, approximately in
agreement with passive evolution models with age approx. 12 Gyr. The slope and
zero-point of the CMR depend on whether colours were defined in fixed physical
or angular apertures, a consequence of the fact that the centers of these
objects tend to be redder: the relation is steeper for fixed angular apertures.
One the other hand, the CsigmaR slope does not show this dependence on the
aperture in which the colour was defined, suggesting that colour gradients are
correlated with residuals from the sigma-M_r relation. As these residuals are
age indicators, our findings suggest that colour gradients correlate with the
age of the stellar population.

systems to their performance limits. In many applications, however, sampling at
the Nyquist rate is inefficient because the signals of interest contain only a
small number of significant frequencies relative to the bandlimit, although the
locations of the frequencies may not be known a priori. For this type of sparse
signal, other sampling strategies are possible. This paper describes a new type
of data acquisition system, called a random demodulator, that is constructed
from robust, readily available components. Let K denote the total number of
frequencies in the signal, and let W denote its bandlimit in Hz. Simulations
suggest that the random demodulator requires just O(K log(W/K)) samples per
second to stably reconstruct the signal. This sampling rate is exponentially
lower than the Nyquist rate of W Hz. In contrast with Nyquist sampling, one
must use nonlinear methods, such as convex programming, to recover the signal
from the samples taken by the random demodulator. This paper provides a
detailed theoretical analysis of the system's performance that supports the
empirical observations.

this FAIR approach the magnetic ground state is derived. Its full excitation
spectrum and the composition of the excitations is calculated and numerically
evaluated. From the excitation spectrum the electron density of states is
calculated. Majority and minority d-resonances are obtained. The width of the
resonances is about twice as wide as the mean field theory predicts. This
broadening is due to the fact that any change of the occupation of the d-state
in one spin band changes the eigenstates in the opposite spin band and causes
transitions in both spin bands. This broadening reduces the height of the
resonance curve and therefore the density of states by a factor of two. This
yields an intuitive understanding for a previous result of the FAIR approach
that the critical value of the Coulomb interaction for the formation of a
magnetic moment is twice as large as the mean field theory predicts.

have identified an excess of microwave emission from the centre of the Milky
Way. It has been suggested that this WMAP haze emission could potentially be
synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons and positrons produced in the
annihilations of one (or more) species of dark matter particles. In this paper
we re-calculate the intensity and morphology of the WMAP haze using a
multi-linear regression involving full-sky templates of the dominant forms of
galactic foreground emission, using two different CMB sky signal estimators.
The first estimator is a posterior mean CMB map, marginalized over a general
foreground model using a Gibbs sampling technique, and the other is the ILC map
produced by the WMAP team. Earlier analyses of the WMAP haze used the ILC map,
which is more contaminated by galactic foregrounds than the Gibbs map. In
either case, we re-confirm earlier results that a statistically significant
residual emission remains after foreground subtraction that is concentrated
around the galactic centre. However, we find that the significance of this
emission can be significantly reduced by allowing for a subtle spatial
variation in the frequency dependence of soft synchrotron emission in the inner
and outer parts of the galaxy. We also re-investigate the prospect of a
neutralino dark matter interpretation of the origin of the haze, and find that
significant boosting in the dark matter annihilation rate is required, relative
to that obtained with a smooth galactic dark matter distribution, in order to
reproduce the inferred residual emission, contrary to that deduced in several
recent studies.

extragalactic sources close enough to avoid significant interaction with the

have suggested that Moebius flows can support dynamo action. In this report, it
is shown that a steady perturbation of a magnetic field in a general twisted
Riemannian flux tube may support dynamo action. Instead of the twist number
used in the above reference, the focus here is on the Frenet torsion of the
magnetic flux tube. A relation between the constant torsion of the screw dynamo
torus, its internal radius, and the ratio between toroidal and poloidal flow.
Solution of self-induction equation for the screw dynamo torsioned flow, can be
solved to yield a Frenet torsion as high as
${\tau}_{0}\approx{7.5{\times}{\Omega}^{\theta}Hz^{-1}m^{-1}}$, for an applied
random magnetic field of $<B^{0}>\approx{45 G}$ for an induced steady
perturbation of $B_{1}\approx{0.03G}$, as in the Perm Riemannian torus
experiment. The Moebius strip plays the role of the propeller divertor which
imprints the angular velocity ${\Omega}^{\theta}$, around the torus axis, to
the dynamo flow, here this role is played by torsion. Actually this situation
is already familiar to plasma physicists, where in stellarators torsion
substitutes very well the role played by external magnetic fields in tokamaks
making magnetic fields twist along plasma toroidal devices. Weak torsion of the
torus channel is assumed.

geometric viewpoint for a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) system as a model of

drift and control Hamiltonians, each of which describes the interaction between
pairs of qubits and between one of qubits and an external magnetic field,
respectively. According to a bipartite partition, the Schroedinger equation for
the NMR system is put in the matrix form. This paper gives a solution to the
Schroedinger equation with the assumptions of small coupling among qubits and
of constant controls. The solution is put in the form of power series in small
parameters. In particular, in the case of the two-qubit NMR system, the drift
and control Hamiltonians are shown to be coupled to work for entanglement
promotion, by examining solutions to the Schroedinger equation in detail. The
concurrence, a measure of entanglement, is evaluated along the solution for a
small time interval in order to observe that the control effect appears, not at
the first-order terms in t, but at the higher-order terms in t. The evaluated
concurrence also suggests which control makes the two-qubit more entangled or

halts migration at semi-major axes in the range 0.13 - 1.7 AU due to gas disk
dispersal. An N-body code is employed that is linked to a viscous gas disk
algorithm capable of simulating: gas loss via accretion onto the central star
and photoevaporation; gap formation by the giant planet; type II migration of
the giant; optional type I migration of protoplanets; gas drag on
planetesimals. We find that most of the inner system planetary building blocks
survive the passage of the giant planet, either by being shepherded inward or
scattered into exterior orbits. Systems of one or more hot-Earths are predicted
to form and remain interior to the giant planet, especially if type II
migration has been limited, or where type I migration has affected
protoplanetary dynamics. Habitable planets in low eccentricity warm-Jupiter
systems appear possible if the giant planet makes a limited incursion into the
outer regions of the habitable zone (HZ), or traverses its entire width and
ceases migrating at a radial distance of less than half that of the HZ's inner
edge. We conclude that Type II migration does not prevent terrestrial planet
formation.

periodic grooves on the input surface is revisited theoretically. It is shown
that the influence to the transmission comes from three parts: the
groove-generated surface plasmon wave (SPW), the nano-slit-generated SPW and
the incident wave. The groove-generated SPW is the main factor determining the
local field distribution around the nano-slit opening, which is directly
related to the transmission through the nano-slit. The nano-slit-generated SPW
can be considered as a disturbance to the light distribution on the input
surface. The influence of the incident wave can be strongly reduced when strong
surface plasmon wave is generated on the input surface by many periods of deep
grooves. Our study shows that the slit-to-groove distance for a maximal
transmission through the nano-slit surrounded with periodic grooves can not be
predicted by several previous theories, including the magnetic field phase
theory of a recent work (Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 043902, 2007). A clear physical
explanation is given for the dependence of the transmission on the

[NII], [SII], and [SIII]. We were able to accurately decompose the emission
line profiles into multiple narrow components (FWHM~30-130kms) superimposed on
a broad (FWHM 150-350kms) feature. This paper is the first of a series
examining the optical structure of M82's disk and inner wind; here we focus on
the ionized gaseous and stellar dynamics and present maps of the relevant
emission line properties.
  Our observations show that ionized gas in the starburst core of M82 is
dynamically complex. Localised line splitting of up to 100kms in the narrow
component is associated with expanding shells of compressed, cool, photoionized
gas. We have been able to associate some of this inner-wind gas with a distinct
outflow channel characterised by its dynamics and gas density patterns, and we
discuss the consequences of this discovery in terms of the developing wind
outflow.
  The broad optical emission line component is observed to become increasingly
important moving outward along the outflow channel, and in general with
increasing height above/below the plane. Following our recent work on the
origins of this component, we associate it with turbulent gas in wind-clump
interface layers and hence sites of mass loading, meaning that the turbulent
mixing of cooler gas into the outflowing hot gas must become increasingly
important with height, and provides powerful direct evidence for the existence
of mass-loading over a large, spatially extended area.

uniqueness of solutions of viscous HPE on a cylinder with Neumann-like boundary
conditions on the top and bottom. In contrast, the regularity of solutions of
NPE remains an open question. With this HPE regularity result in mind, the
second issue examined in this paper is whether extreme events are allowed to
arise spontaneously in their solutions. Such events could include, for example,
the sudden appearance and disappearance of locally intense fronts that do not
involve deep convection. Analytical methods are used to show that for viscous
HPE, the creation of small-scale structures is allowed locally in space and
time at sizes that scale inversely with the Reynolds number.

optical second harmonic generation, using superlattices with varying
periodicity to study the evolution of the electronic reconstruction while
avoiding substrate contributions. The superlattices show large perpendicular
optical nonlinearity, which abruptly increases when the sublattice thickness
goes above 3 unit cells, revealing substantial effects of the polar-nonpolar
interface. The nonlinear 'active' area is primarily in SrTiO3, develops with
increasing thickness, and extends up to 8 unit cells from the interface.

performance was studied in presence of e+e- pair background from beamstrahlung
in the International Linear Collider (ILC). Five layer ""long-barrel"" VTX
geometry with varying layer thickness, space resolution and radius of the first
layer was tested with fast simulation tools. Influence of VTX geometry and e+e-
pair background on measurement of SM and MSSM Higgs boson branching ratios was
also studied.
