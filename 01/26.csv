top quark mass for each $\phi_{\nu_1},\phi_{\nu_2}$ pair by minimizing a
$\chi^2$ function in the t-tbar dilepton hypothesis. We assign
$\chi^2$-dependent weights to the solutions in order to build a preferred mass

simulated t-tbar and background events, and parameterized in order to provide
continuous probability density functions. A likelihood fit to the mass

used to evaluate antiretroviral (ARV) therapies in AIDS clinical trials. This
marker can be used to assess the ARV potency of therapies, but is easily
affected by drug exposures, drug resistance and other factors during the
long-term treatment evaluation process. HIV dynamic studies have significantly
contributed to the understanding of HIV pathogenesis and ARV treatment
strategies. However, the models of these studies are used to quantify
short-term HIV dynamics ($<$ 1 month), and are not applicable to describe
long-term virological response to ARV treatment due to the difficulty of
establishing a relationship of antiviral response with multiple treatment
factors such as drug exposure and drug susceptibility during long-term
treatment. Long-term therapy with ARV agents in HIV-infected patients often
results in failure to suppress the viral load. Pharmacokinetics (PK), drug
resistance and imperfect adherence to prescribed antiviral drugs are important
factors explaining the resurgence of virus. To better understand the factors
responsible for the virological failure, this paper develops the
mechanism-based nonlinear differential equation models for characterizing
long-term viral dynamics with ARV therapy. The models directly incorporate drug
concentration, adherence and drug susceptibility into a function of treatment
efficacy and, hence, fully integrate virologic, PK, drug adherence and
resistance from an AIDS clinical trial into the analysis. A Bayesian nonlinear
mixed-effects modeling approach in conjunction with the rescaled version of
dynamic differential equations is investigated to estimate dynamic parameters
and make inference. In addition, the correlations of baseline factors with
estimated dynamic parameters are explored and some biologically meaningful
correlation results are presented. Further, the estimated dynamic parameters in
patients with virologic success were compared to those in patients with
virologic failure and significantly important findings were summarized. These
results suggest that viral dynamic parameters may play an important role in
understanding HIV pathogenesis, designing new treatment strategies for
long-term care of AIDS patients.

The mitochondria is a particular case because the inner mitochondrial space, ie

addition to matricial enzymes, other enzymes are located inside the membranes

that can incorporate such effects. The Poisson model is unfortunately
prohibitively expensive for numerical computation because of the presence of

In this approach and contrary to the original Hamiltonian, the obtained
effective Hamiltonian is rather a real-line one. Accordingly, this work
resembles the first reasonable analysis for the existence of the asymptotic
freedom property in the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric $(-\phi^{4})$ theory. In this
respect, we calculated three different amplitudes of different positive
dimensions (in mass units) and find that all of them goes to very small values

asymptotic freedom property of the theory. To test the validity of our

$\Lambda$ has the value $\frac{(4 \pi)^{2}}{6}= 26. 319$ compared to the result

interior-disjoint rectangles. Rectangular layouts appear in various
applications: as rectangular cartograms in cartography, as floorplans in
building architecture and VLSI design, and as graph drawings. Often areas are
associated with the rectangles of a rectangular layout and it might hence be
desirable if one rectangular layout can represent several area assignments. A
layout is area-universal if any assignment of areas to rectangles can be
realized by a combinatorially equivalent rectangular layout. We identify a
simple necessary and sufficient condition for a rectangular layout to be
area-universal: a rectangular layout is area-universal if and only if it is
one-sided. More generally, given any rectangular layout L and any assignment of
areas to its regions, we show that there can be at most one layout (up to
horizontal and vertical scaling) which is combinatorially equivalent to L and
achieves a given area assignment. We also investigate similar questions for
perimeter assignments. The adjacency requirements for the rectangles of a
rectangular layout can be specified in various ways, most commonly via the dual
graph of the layout. We show how to find an area-universal layout for a given
set of adjacency requirements whenever such a layout exists.

wormhole geometry with the one of a Kerr black hole, we verify that the
intensity of the flux emerging from the disk surface is greater for wormholes

engine for the transformation of the accreting mass into radiation than the
Kerr black holes. Therefore specific signatures appear in the electromagnetic
spectrum of thin disks around rotating wormholes, thus leading to the
possibility of distinguishing wormhole geometries by using astrophysical

entanglement generated between walkers does not reach the highest degree of

entanglement ratio (entanglement generated/highest value of entanglement

depends on the coin initial state and on the coin measurement outcome.
Furthermore, our numerical simulations show that, for the quantum walks used in

arXiv:0808.3162, about noise-based logic, we showed how simple superpositions
of single logic basis vectors can be achieved in a single wire. The
superposition components were the N orthogonal logic basis vectors. Supposing
that the different logic values have ""on/off"" states only, the resultant
discrete superposition state represents a single number with N bit accuracy in
a single wire, where N is the number of orthogonal logic vectors in the base.
In the present paper, we show that the logic hyperspace (product) vectors
defined in the introductory paper can be generalized to provide the discrete
superposition of 2^N orthogonal system states. This is equivalent to a
multi-valued logic system with 2^(2^N) logic values per wire. This is a similar
situation to quantum informatics with N qubits, and hence we introduce the
notion of noise-bit. This system has major differences compared to quantum
informatics. The noise-based logic system is deterministic and each
superposition element is instantly accessible with the high digital accuracy,
via a real hardware parallelism, without decoherence and error correction, and
without the requirement of repeating the logic operation many times to extract
the probabilistic information. Moreover, the states in noise-based logic do not
have to be normalized, and non-unitary operations can also be used. As an
example, we introduce a string search algorithm which is O(M^0.5) times faster
than Grover's quantum algorithm (where M is the number of string entries),
while it has the same hardware complexity class as the quantum algorithm.

investigate toy models in which no Higgs fields or other constructs are

standard SU(3)_c x SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y gauge symmetry and fermion content similar
to that of the standard model. The first class--like the standard electroweak
theory--contains no bare mass terms, so the spontaneous breaking of chiral
symmetry within quantum chromodynamics is the only source of electroweak
symmetry breaking. The second class adds bare fermion masses sufficiently small
that QCD remains the dominant source of electroweak symmetry breaking and the
model can serve as a well-behaved low-energy effective field theory to energies
somewhat above the hadronic scale. A third class of models is based on the
left-right--symmetric SU(3)_c x SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R x U(1)_{B-L} gauge group. In
a fourth class of models, built on SU(4)_{PS} x SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R gauge

characteristics of the models stem from the fact that the effective strength of
the weak interactions is much closer to that of the residual strong

informative contrasts to the real world, but also lead us to consider
intriguing issues in the application of field theory to the real world.

interpreted as an indirect signature of rapid photo-heating in the IGM during
the epoch of HeII reionisation. We examine this interpretation using a
semi-analytic model of inhomogeneous HeII reionisation and high resolution
hydrodynamical simulations of the Lya forest. We instead find that a rapid
(\Delta z ~ 0.2) boost to the IGM temperature (\Delta T ~ 10^4 K) beginning at
z=3.4 produces a well understood and generic evolution in the Lya effective
optical depth, where a sudden reduction in the opacity is followed by a
gradual, monotonic recovery driven largely by adiabatic cooling in the low
density IGM. This behaviour is inconsistent with the narrow feature in the
observational data. If photo-heating during HeII reionisation is instead
extended over several redshift units, as recent theoretical studies suggest,
then the Lya opacity will evolve smoothly with redshift. We conclude that the
sharp dip observed in the Lya forest effective optical depth is instead most
likely due to a narrow peak in the hydrogen photo-ionisation rate around z=3.2,
and suggest that it may arise from the modulation of either reprocessed
radiation during HeII reionisation, or the opacity of Lyman limit systems.

charge of electrons may be dominant. However, quite recently the atomic
ionization tunneling time has been measured. Experimental data of photonic,
phononic, and electronic tunneling time is available now and will be presented.
It appears that the tunneling time is a universal property independent of the
field in question.

characterise the emission and absorption properties.
  Results. A spin period of 809.7+-0.6 s is present, revealed as a complex

contexts, such as query optimization, data exchange, and data integration. Its
practicability, however, is limited by the fact that - for an arbitrary set of
constraints - it might not terminate; even worse, chase termination is an
undecidable problem in general. In response, the database community has
proposed sufficient restrictions on top of the constraints that guarantee chase
termination on any database instance. In this paper, we propose a novel
sufficient termination condition, called inductive restriction, which strictly
generalizes previous conditions, but can be checked as efficiently.
Furthermore, we motivate and study the problem of data-dependent chase
termination and, as a key result, present sufficient termination conditions
w.r.t. fixed instances. They are strictly more general than inductive
restriction and might guarantee termination although the chase does not
terminate in the general case.

expressed by syntactic contexts, typical for a given meaning. The link between
each sense trend and the utterances used to build the sense trend are also

tomography of the N III 4640.64 Bowen blend emission line reveals a focused
spot of emission at a location consistent with the secondary star. The velocity
of this emission occurs at 324 +/- 15 km/s; applying a ""K-correction"", we find
the velocity of the secondary star projected onto the line of sight to be 370

mass ratio of the system to be 0.044^{+0.005}_{-0.004}, and the mass function
for the pulsar to be 0.44^{+0.16}_{-0.13} Msun. Combining this mass function
with various inclination estimates from other authors, we find no evidence to
suggest that the neutron star in SAX J1808.4-3658 is more massive than the
canonical value of 1.4 Msun. Our optical light curves exhibit a possible
superhump modulation, expected for a system with such a low mass ratio. The
equivalent width of the Ca II H and K interstellar absorption lines suggest
that the distance to the source is ~2.5 kpc. This is consistent with previous

of hydrogen, but lower than more recent estimates which assume helium-rich

(index ellipsoid). Rotation of the optical indicatrix arises in three-fold
electrooptical crystals under the action of the rotating electric field applied
perpendicular to the optical axis \cite% {pat}. Such a rotation is possible as
in the Pockels as Kerr crystals and also in the isotropic Kerr medium. The
rotation is used in single-sideband modulators. The single-sideband modulation
has very interesting features from the theoretical viewpoint. In applications
it may be used for the frequency modulation and frequency shifting. In contrast
to usual modulation such a shifting is ""100 persent transformation"" of the
initial into output frequency. However at present the modulation practically is
not in use. It is connected with the high controlling voltage of bulk
modulators; creating waveguide single-sideband modulators calls for
considerable technological efforts.

rather than the theoretical null distribution can be critical for correct

Based on the central matching method for $z$-scores, mode matching estimates
the null density by fitting an appropriate exponential family to the histogram
of the test statistics by Poisson regression in a region surrounding the mode.
The empirical null estimate is then used to estimate local and tail false
discovery rate (FDR) for inference. Delta-method covariance formulas and
approximate asymptotic bias formulas are provided, as well as simulation
studies of the effect of the tuning parameters of the procedure on the
bias-variance trade-off. The standard FDR estimates are found to be biased down
at the far tails. Correlation between test statistics is taken into account in
the covariance estimates, providing a generalization of Efron's ``wing

shown in a family-based genome-wide association study from the Framingham Heart
Study and an anatomical brain imaging study of dyslexia in children.

Cauchy distribution with center 0 and scale 2.5, which in the simplest setting
is a longer-tailed version of the distribution attained by assuming one-half
additional success and one-half additional failure in a logistic regression.
Cross-validation on a corpus of datasets shows the Cauchy class of prior
distributions to outperform existing implementations of Gaussian and Laplace
priors. We recommend this prior distribution as a default choice for routine
applied use. It has the advantage of always giving answers, even when there is
complete separation in logistic regression (a common problem, even when the
sample size is large and the number of predictors is small), and also
automatically applying more shrinkage to higher-order interactions. This can be
useful in routine data analysis as well as in automated procedures such as
chained equations for missing-data imputation. We implement a procedure to fit
generalized linear models in R with the Student-$t$ prior distribution by
incorporating an approximate EM algorithm into the usual iteratively weighted
least squares. We illustrate with several applications, including a series of
logistic regressions predicting voting preferences, a small bioassay
experiment, and an imputation model for a public health data set.

time-resolved optical spectroscopy and R-band photometry with the aim of
measuring the mass of the white dwarf and the donor star and the orbital
inclination. Methods. Cross-correlation of the spectra with K-type dwarf
templates is used to derive the radial velocity curve of the donor star. An
optimal subtraction of the broadened templates is performed to measure the
rotational broadening and constrain the spectral type of the donor. Finally, an
ellipsoidal model is fitted to the R-band light curve to obtain constraints
upon the orbital inclination of the binary system. Results. The orbital period

0.00000002 h), and the amplitude of the donor's radial velocity curve is K2 =
162.4 +- 1.4 km/s. Modelling the ellipsoidal light curves gives an orbital
inclination in the range i = 59 +- 3 deg. A rotational broadening between 82.4

darkening, respectively. The secondary star has most likely a spectral type K5

star mass of 0.23 < M2(Msol) < 0.44. Conclusions. We find that the donor star
in HS 0218+3229 is significantly undermassive for its spectral type. It is
therefore very likely that it has undergone nuclear evolution prior to the
onset of mass transfer.

virus (HIV), the frequency and type of contacts between study participants and
infectious sources are among the most informative risk factors, but are often
not adequately adjusted for in standard analyses. Such adjustment can improve
the assessment of vaccine efficacy as well as the assessment of risk factors.
It can be attained by modeling transmission per contact with infectious
sources. However, information about contacts that rely on self-reporting by
study participants are subject to nontrivial measurement error in many studies.
We develop a Bayesian hierarchical model fitted using Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) sampling to estimate the vaccine efficacy controlled for exposure to
infection, while adjusting for measurement error in contact-related factors.
Our method is used to re-analyze two recent HIV vaccine studies, and the
results are compared with the published primary analyses that used standard
methods. The proposed method could also be used for other vaccines where
contact information is collected, such as human papilloma virus vaccines.

ideal data base for performing a statistical evaluation of the flux
cross-calibration of the XMM-Newton European Photon Imaging Cameras (EPIC). We
aim to evaluate the status of the relative flux calibration of the EPIC cameras
on board XMM-Newton (MOS1, MOS2, and pn) and investigate the dependence of the
calibration on energy, position in the field of view of the X-ray detectors,
and lifetime of the mission. We compiled the distribution of flux percentage
differences for large samples of 'good quality' objects detected with at least
two of the EPIC cameras. The mean offset of the fluxes and dispersion of the
distributions was then found by Gaussian fitting. Count rate to flux conversion
was performed with a fixed spectral model. The impact on the results of varying
this model was investigated. Excellent agreement was found between the two EPIC
MOS cameras to better than 4% from 0.2 keV to 12.0 keV. MOS cameras register
7-9% higher flux than pn below 4.5 keV and 10-13% flux excess above 4.5 keV. No
evolution of the flux ratios is seen with time, except at energies below 0.5
keV, where we found a strong decrease in the MOS to pn flux ratio with time.
This effect is known to be due to a gradually degrading MOS redistribution
function. The flux ratios show some dependence on distance from the optical
axis in the sense that the MOS to pn flux excess increases with off-axis angle.
Furthermore, in the 4.5-12.0 keV band there is a strong dependence of the MOS
to pn excess flux on the azimuthal-angle. These results strongly suggest that
the calibration of the Reflection Grating Array (RGA) blocking factors is
incorrect at high energies. Finally, we recommend ways to improve the
calculation of fluxes in future versions of XMM-Newton source catalogues.

growth of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in accretion discs. The
analysis is performed by use of analytical and numerical means. We provide a
general dispersion relation together with the corresponding eigenfunctions
describing the growth rates of small disturbances on a homogeneous background
shear flow. The dispersion relation includes compressibility and radiative
effects in the flux-limited diffusion approximation. By introducing an
effective speed of sound, all the effects of radiation transport can be
subsumed into one single parameter. It can be shown that the growth rates of
the vertical modes -- which are the fastest growing ones -- are reduced by
radiative transport. For the case of non-vertical modes, the growth rates may
instead be enhanced. We quantify the effects of compressibility and radiative
diffusion on the growth rates for the gas-pressure dominated case. The
analytical discussion is supplemented by numerical simulations, which are also
used for a first investigation of the non-linear stage of the MRI in
gas-pressure dominated accretion discs with radiation transport included.
