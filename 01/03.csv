""nodal-anti-nodal dichotomy"" observed in recent experiments. Our theory begins
with an ordered antiferromagnetic Fermi liquid with electron and hole pockets.
We argue that it is useful to consider a quantum transition at which the loss
of antiferromagnetic order leads to a hypothetical metallic ""algebraic charge
liquid"" (ACL) with pockets of charge -e and +e fermions, and an emergent U(1)
gauge field; the instabilities of the ACL lead to the low temperature phases of
the underdoped cuprates. The pairing instability leads to a superconductor with
the strongest pairing within the -e Fermi pockets, a d-wave pairing signature
for electrons, and very weak nodal-point pairing of the +e fermions near the
Brillouin zone diagonals. The influence of an applied magnetic field is
discussed using a proposed phase diagram as a function of field strength and
doping. We describe the influence of gauge field and pairing fluctuations on
the quantum Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in the normal states induced by the
field. For the finite temperature pseudogap region, our theory has some
similarities to the phenomenological two-fluid model of -2e bosons and +e
fermions proposed by Geshkenbein, Ioffe, and Larkin [cond-mat/9609209], which
describes anomalous aspects of transverse transport in a magnetic field.

of proposed telescope designs to forecast the constraints and detectability

21 cm lensing. The combination of galaxy and 21 cm lensing could constrain the

ratio of the bolometric luminosity of an AGN to the Eddington limit for its

have been plotted on the N_H - lambda_Edd plane. Only one source lies in the

the X-ray flux decay of about 70% of the afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).
The physical origin of this feature is still being debated. We constrain the
proposed interpretations, based on the intrinsic temporal properties of the
plateau phase. We selected and analyzed all the Swift/XRT GRB afterglows at
known redshift observed between March 2005 and June 2008 featuring a shallow
decay phase in their X-ray lightcurves. For our sample of 21 GRBs we find an
anticorrelation of the logarithm of the duration of the shallow phase with re
dshift, with a Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient of r=-0.4 and a null
hypothesis probability of 5%. When we correct the durations for cosmological
dilation, the anticorrelation strenghtens, with r=-0.6 and a null hypothesis
probability of 0.4%. Considering only those GRBs in our sample that have a
well-measured burst peak energy (8 out of 21), we find an anticorrelation
between the energy of the burst and the shallow phase duration, with r=-0.80
and a null hypothesis probability of 1.8%. If the burst energy anticorrelation
with the shallow phase duration is real, then the dependence of the shallow
phase on redshift could be the result of a selection effect, since on average
high-redshift bursts with lower energies and longer plateaus would be missed. A
burst energy anticorrelation with the shallow phase duration would be expected
if the end of the plateau arises from a collimated outflow. Alternative
scenarios are briefly discussed involving a possible cosmological evolution of
the mechanism responsible for the X-ray shallow decay.

view they used nonlinear trajectories, dependent on a speed and direction, what
is more realistic than the linear extrapolation with only one parameter (a
speed). However, there are two errors and one mistake in their procedure: (1)
HS used two free parameters of the direction, whereas only one can be freely
selected, because the second is provided by SMEI data. As a result, the
directions determined by HS are incorrect. (2) HS overlooked that, since the
trajectory depends on more than one parameter, there is a broad set of
trajectories, for various speeds and directions, matching the event, and thus a
broad range of the onset times. HS select only one trajectory for each SMEI
event. Therefore the associations made by them are incomplete, and they should
be reexamined. As long as it is not done any conclusion about CMEs undetected
by solar coronagraphs are premature. (3) HS made some mistake in determination
of the SMEI speeds. The speeds given in their Table 1 are about twice as high

the SMEI speed distribution is excessively shifted toward high speeds ; hence,
there is no reason to search for a physical explanation.

the Hubble scale during inflation can exceed the gravitino mass. Finally, the

motion of saltating particles due to gravity, fluid drag, particle spin, fluid
shear, and turbulence. Moreover, the model explicitly accounts for the
retardation of the wind due to drag from saltating particles. We also developed
a physically-based parameterization of the ejection of surface particles by
impacting saltating particles which matches experimental results. Our numerical
model is the first to reproduce measurements of the wind shear velocity at the
impact threshold (i.e., the lowest shear velocity for which saltation is
possible) and of the aerodynamic roughness length in saltation. It also
correctly predicts a wide range of other saltation processes, including
profiles of the wind speed and particle mass flux, the total height-integrated
mass flux, and the size distribution of saltating particles. Indeed, our model
is the first to reproduce such a wide range of experimental data. Since we use
a minimum number of empirical relations, our model can be easily adapted to
study saltation under a variety of physical conditions, such as saltation on
other planets, saltation under water, and saltating snow. We aim to use our

of narrow filaments that are swept back by differential rotation into a
trailing spiral. The correlation lengths along each of the correlation function
principal axes decrease monotonically with the grid scale. For mean azimuthal
field models, which we argue are more relevant to astrophysical disks than the
zero net field models, we find that: $\alpha$ increases weakly with increasing
resolution at fixed box size; $\alpha$ increases slightly as the box size is
increased; $\alpha$ increases linearly with net field strength, confirming
earlier results; the two-point correlation function of the magnetic field is
resolved and converged, and is composed of narrow filaments swept back by the

setting of the {\em wiretap channel} due to Wyner. In a typical communications
system a cryptographic application is run at a layer above the physical layer
and assumes the channel is error free. However, in any real application the
channels for friendly users and passive eavesdroppers are not error free and
Wyner's wiretap model addresses this scenario. Using this model, we show the
security of a common cryptographic primitive, i.e. a keystream generator based
on linear feedback shift registers (LFSR), can be strengthened by exploiting
properties of the physical layer. A passive eavesdropper can be made to
experience greater difficulty in cracking an LFSR-based cryptographic system
insomuch that the computational complexity of discovering the secret key
increases by orders of magnitude, or is altogether infeasible. This result is
shown for two fast correlation attacks originally presented by Meier and
Staffelbach, in the context of channel errors due to the wiretap channel model.

performing a Legendre transformation, surface terms are added in order to
guarantee a well defined variational principle with which to obtain sensible
equations of motion, and also to allow later on the thermodynamical analysis.
Then a Kucha\v{r} canonical transformation is done, which changes from the
metric canonical coordinates to the physical parameters coordinates. Again a
well defined variational principle is guaranteed through boundary terms. These
terms influence the fall-off conditions of the variables and at the same time
the form of the new Lagrange multipliers. Reduction to the true degrees of
freedom is performed, which are the conserved mass and charge of the black
hole. Upon quantization a Lorentzian partition function $Z$ is written for the
grand canonical ensemble, where the temperature $\bf T$ and the electric
potential $\phi$ are fixed at infinity. After imposing Euclidean boundary
conditions on the partition function, the respective effective action $I_*$,
and thus the thermodynamical partition function, is determined for any
dimension $d$ and topology $k$. This is a quite general action. Several
previous results can be then condensed in our single general formula for the
effective action $I_*$. Phase transitions are studied for the spherical case,
and it is shown that all the other topologies have no phase transitions. A
parallel with the Bose-Einstein condensation can be established. Finally, the
expected values of energy, charge, and entropy are determined for the black
hole solution.

metal-insulator transition (MIT) of non-interacting electrons in d > 2 spatial
dimensions. At the transition, the complex spatial structure of the critical
wavefunctions is reflected in the non-linear behavior of the multifractal
spectrum of generalized inverse participation ratios (IPRs). Beyond the
crossover from narrow to broad IPR statistics, which always occurs for
sufficiently large moments of the wavefunction amplitude, the spectrum obtained
from a typical wavefunction associated with a particular disorder realization
differs markedly from that obtained from the disorder-averaged IPRs. This
phenomenon is known as the termination of the multifractal spectrum. We provide
a field theoretical derivation for the termination of the typical multifractal
spectrum, by combining the non-linear sigma model framework, conventionally
used to access the MIT in d = 2 + epsilon dimensions, with a functional
renormalization group (FRG) technique. The FRG method deployed here was
originally pioneered to study the properties of the two-dimensional (2D) random
phase XY model [D. Carpentier and P. Le Doussal, Nucl. Phys. B 588, 565
(2000)]. The same method was used to demonstrate the termination of the
multifractal spectrum in the very special problem of 2D Dirac fermions subject
to a random Abelian vector potential. Our result shows that the typical
multifractal wavefunction spectrum and its termination can be obtained at a
generic Anderson localization transition in d > 2, within the standard field
theoretical framework of the non-linear sigma model, when combined with the
FRG.

apply three cases for ionization conditions: Fully neutral, fully reionized,
and a patchy model based on the flux from the nearest galaxy. We find that our
simulations broadly fit available z~5-6 IGM metal-line data, although all
observations cannot be accommodated with a single ionization condition.
Variations in O I absorbers among sight lines seen by Becker et al. (2006)
suggest significant neutral IGM patches down to z~6. Strong C IV absorbers at
z~6 may be the result of ionization by their parent galaxy. Our outflows have
typical speeds of ~200 km/s and mass loading factors of ~6. Such high mass
loading is critical for enriching the IGM to the observed levels while
curtailing star formation to match the observed z~6 rest-frame UV luminosity
function. The volume filling factor of metals increases during this epoch, but
only reaches ~1% for Z>10^(-3) Zsolar by z=5. C IV is an ideal tracer of IGM
metals at z~5-6, with dropping global ionization fractions to either higher or
lower redshifts. This results in a strongly increasing global Omega(C IV) from
z=8->5, in contrast to its relative constancy from z=5->2. Our simulations do
not support widespread early IGM enrichment from e.g. Pop III stars. High-z
absorbers arise from metals on their first outward journey from galaxies, at
distances less than 50 kpc. The galaxies responsible for early IGM enrichment
have typical M*=10^(7.0-8.5) Msolar.

networks based on random walks with damping was formulated with two fundamental
modes: emitting and absorbing. While many other network analysis methods based
on random walks or equivalent notions have been developed before and after our
earlier work, one can show that they can all be mapped to one of the two modes.
In addition to these two fundamental modes, a major strength of our earlier
formalism was its accommodation of context-specific directed information flow
that yielded plausible and meaningful biological interpretation of protein
functions and pathways. However, the directed flow from origins to destinations
was induced via a potential function that was heuristic. Here, with a
theoretically sound approach called the channel mode, we extend our earlier
work for directed information flow. This is achieved by constructing a
potential function facilitating a purely probabilistic interpretation of the
channel mode. For each network node, the channel mode combines the solutions of
emitting and absorbing modes in the same context, producing what we call a
channel tensor. The entries of the channel tensor at each node can be
interpreted as the amount of flow passing through that node from an origin to a
destination. Similarly to our earlier model, the channel mode encompasses
damping as a free parameter that controls the locality of information flow.
Through examples involving the yeast pheromone response pathway, we illustrate
the versatility and stability of our new framework.

validate the dynamics that underlie the evolution of the structure of the web.
We find that the overall structure of the web is defined by an intricate
interplay between experience or entitlement of the pages (as measured by the
number of inbound hyperlinks a page already has), inherent talent or fitness of
the pages (as measured by the likelihood that someone visiting the page would
give a hyperlink to it), and the continual high rates of birth and death of
pages on the web. We find that the web is conservative in judging talent and
the overall fitness distribution is exponential, showing low variability. The
small variance in talent, however, is enough to lead to experience
distributions with high variance: The preferential attachment mechanism
amplifies these small biases and leads to heavy-tailed power-law (PL) inbound
degree distributions over all pages, as well as over pages that are of the same
age. The balancing act between experience and talent on the web allows newly
introduced pages with novel and interesting content to grow quickly and surpass
older pages. In this regard, it is much like what we observe in high-mobility
and meritocratic societies: People with entitlement continue to have access to
the best resources, but there is just enough screening for fitness that allows
for talented winners to emerge and join the ranks of the leaders. Finally, we
show that the fitness estimates have potential practical applications in
ranking query results.

of the nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 1365. The X-ray emission is resolved into
point-like sources and complex, extended emission. The X-ray morphology of the
extended emission shows a biconical soft X-ray emission region extending ~5 kpc
in projection from the nucleus, coincident with the high excitation outflow
cones seen in optical emission lines particularly to the northwest. Harder
X-ray emission is detected from a kpc-diameter circumnuclear ring, coincident
with the star-forming ring prominent in the Spitzer mid-infrared images; this
X-ray emission is partially obscured by the central dust lane of NGC 1365.
Spectral fitting of spatially separated components indicates a thermal plasma
origin for the soft extended X-ray emission (kT=0.57 keV). Only a small amount
of this emission can be due to photoionization by the nuclear source. Detailed
comparison with [OIII]5007 observations shows the hot interstellar medium (ISM)
is spatially anticorrelated with the [OIII] emitting clouds and has thermal
pressures comparable to those of the [OIII] medium, suggesting that the hot ISM
acts as a confining medium for the cooler photoionized clouds. The abundance
ratios of the hot ISM are fully consistent with the theoretical values for
enrichment from Type II supernovae, suggesting that the hot ISM is a wind from
the starburst circumnuclear ring. X-ray emission from a ~450 pc long nuclear
radio jet is also detected to the southeast.

represents a collision of characteristics. The resulting shock is resolved by
merging particles so that the total area under the function is conserved. The

black hole (MBH) as it disrupts or accretes stars in a galactic centre. If a
star enters the LC then, depending on its properties, its interaction with the
MBH will either generate a luminous electromagnetic flare or give rise to
gravitational radiation, both of which are expected to have directly observable
consequences. A thorough understanding of loss-cone refilling mechanisms is
important for the prediction of astrophysical quantities, such as rates of
tidal disrupting main-sequence stars, rates of capturing compact stellar
remnants and timescales of merging binary MBHs. In this thesis, we use N-body
simulations to investigate how noise from accreted satellites and other
substructures in a galaxy's halo can affect the LC refilling rate.
  Any N-body model suffers from Poisson noise which is similar to, but much
stronger than, the two-body diffusion occurring in real galaxies. To lessen
this spurious Poisson noise, we apply the idea of importance sampling to
develop a new scheme for constructing N-body realizations of a galaxy model, in
which interesting regions of phase-space are sampled by many low-mass
particles. We use multimass N-body models of galaxies with centrally-embedded
MBHs to study the effects of satellite flybys on LC refilling rates. We find
that although the flux of stars into the initially emptied LC is enhanced, but
the fuelling rate averaged over the entire subhalos is increased by only a
factor 3 over the rate one expects from the Poisson noise due the discreteness
of the stellar distribution.

In this work we
investigate its flux variability and study the intermediate long and short
bursts discovered by Swift on July 17, and 27, 2008, respectively. So far, only
one intermediate long burst, with a duration of ~18 minutes and ten days later
a short burst, have been recorded from XTE J1701-407. We analyzed the public
available data from Swift and RXTE, and compared the observed properties of the
intermediate long burst with theoretical ignition condition and light curves to
investigate the possible nuclear burning processes. The intermediate long burst
may have exhibited a photospheric radius expansion, allowing us to derive the
source distance at 6.2 kpc assuming the empirically derived Eddington
luminosity for pure helium. The intermediate long burst decay was best fit by
using two exponential functions with e-folding times of \tau_1=40(3) s and
\tau_2=221(9) s. The bursts occurred at a persistent luminosity of
L_{per}=8.3x10E36 erg/s. For the intermediate long burst the mass accretion
rate per unit area onto the NS was \dot{m}=4x10E3 g/cm2/s, and the total energy
released was E_{burst}=3.5x10E40 erg. This corresponds to an ignition column
depth of y_{ign}=1.8x10E9 g/cm2, for a pure helium burning. We find that the
energetics of this burst can be modeled in different ways, as (i) pure helium
ignition, as the result of either pure helium accretion or depletion of
hydrogen by steady burning during accumulation, or (ii) as ignition of a thick
layer of hydrogen-rich material in a source with low metallicity. However,
comparison of the burst duration with model light curves suggests that hydrogen
burning plays a role during the burst, and therefore this source is a low
accretion rate burster with a low metallicity in the accreted material.

Kalkman's BRST model, here we introduce the Weil algebra $W(A)$ associated to
any Lie algebroid $A$. We then show that this Weil algebra is related to the
Bott-Shulman-Stasheff complex (computing the cohomology of the classifying
space) via a Van Est map and we prove a Van Est isomorphism theorem. As
application, we generalize and find a simpler more conceptual proof of the main
result of Bursztyn et.al. on the reconstructions of multiplicative forms and of
a result of Weinstein-Xu and Crainic on the reconstruction of connection
1-forms. This reveals the relevance of the Weil algebra and Van Est maps to the
integration and the pre-quantization of Poisson (and Dirac) manifolds.

much smaller than G_N^(-1/2) \sim 10^19 GeV. In particular, the collision of a
ultrahigh energy cosmic ray with a dark matter particle in our galactic halo or
with another cosmic ray could result into a black hole of mass between 10^4 and
10^11 GeV. Once produced, such object would evaporate into elementary particles
via Hawking radiation. We show that the interactions among the particles
exiting the black hole are not able to produce a photosphere nor a
chromosphere. We then evaluate how these particles evolve using the jet-code
HERWIG, and obtain a final diffuse flux of stable 4-dimensional particles
peaked at 0.2 GeV. This flux consists of an approximate 43% of neutrinos, a 28%
of electrons, a 16% of photons and a 13% of protons. Emission into the bulk
would range from a 1.4% of the total energy for n=2 to a 16% for n=6.

oriented Riemannian manifold $M$ to a metric $\hat{g}$ on the total space $P$
of the orthonormal frame bundle of $M$. We call this lift the \textit {Wagner
lift}. Viktor Vladimirovich Wagner (1908 -1981) proposed a technique to extend
a metric defined on a non-holonomic distribution to its prolongation via the
Lie brackets. We apply the Wagner construction to the specific case when the
distribution is the infinitesimal connection in the orthonormal frame bundle
which corresponds to a Levi-Civita connection. We find relations between the
geometry of the Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ and of the total space $(P,G)$ of
the orthonormal frame bundle endowed with the lifted metric.

analysis, are widely used in climate data analysis as a means to aid in the
interpretation of datasets of high dimensionality. These linear methods may not
be appropriate for the analysis of data arising from nonlinear processes
occurring in the climate system. Numerous techniques for nonlinear
dimensionality reduction have been developed recently that may provide a
potentially useful tool for the identification of low-dimensional manifolds in
climate data sets arising from nonlinear dynamics. In this thesis I apply three
such techniques to the study of El Nino/Southern Oscillation variability in
tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures and thermocline depth, comparing
observational data with simulations from coupled atmosphere-ocean general
circulation models from the CMIP3 multi-model ensemble.
  The three methods used here are a nonlinear principal component analysis
(NLPCA) approach based on neural networks, the Isomap isometric mapping
algorithm, and Hessian locally linear embedding. I use these three methods to
examine El Nino variability in the different data sets and assess the
suitability of these nonlinear dimensionality reduction approaches for climate
data analysis.
  I conclude that although, for the application presented here, analysis using
NLPCA, Isomap and Hessian locally linear embedding does not provide additional
information beyond that already provided by principal component analysis, these
methods are effective tools for exploratory data analysis.
