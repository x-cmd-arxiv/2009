candidate. Recently, we published accurate values for the mass of the black
hole and the orbital inclination angle of the binary system. Building on these
results, we have analyzed 53 X-ray spectra obtained by RXTE and, using a
selected sample of 18 of these spectra, we have determined the dimensionless
spin parameter of the black hole to be a* = 0.92(-0.07,+0.05). This result
takes into account all sources of observational and model-parameter
uncertainties. The standard deviation around the mean value of a* for these 18
X-ray spectra, which were obtained over a span of several years, is only 0.02.
When we consider our complete sample of 53 RXTE spectra, we find a somewhat
higher value of the spin parameter and a larger standard deviation. Finally, we
show that our results based on RXTE data are confirmed by our analyses of
selected X-ray spectra obtained by the XMM-Newton, BeppoSAX and Ginga missions.

not only damps the oscillation, but also introduces randomness. In the
so-called ``grand-mother'' clock, discovered by Huygens in the 18th century,
damping is compensated for, on the average, by an escapement mechanism driven
by a falling weight. The purpose of this paper is to show that such a clock is,
in its idealized form, a quiet oscillator. By ``quiet'' we mean that in spite
of the randomness introduced by damping, the dissipated power (viewed as the
oscillator output) does not fluctuate slowly. Comparison is made with quiet
laser oscillators discovered theoretically in 1984. Because the input power
does not fluctuate in both the mechanical oscillator and the quiet laser

of species numbers across genera in a higher taxonomic category, is known to be
a highly skewed distribution. Because the sublineages (such as genera in a
clade) themselves follow a random birth process, deriving the distribution of
lineage sizes involves averaging the solutions to a birth and death process
over the distribution of time intervals separating the origin of the lineages.
In this paper, we show that the resulting distributions can be represented by
hypergeometric functions of the second kind. We also provide approximations of
these distributions up to the second order, and compare these results to the
asymptotic distributions and numerical approximations used in previous studies.
For two limiting cases, one with a relatively high rate of lineage origin, one
with a low rate, the cumulative probability densities and percentiles are
compared to show that the approximations are robust over a wide rane of
parameters. It is proposed that the probability density distributions of
lineage size may have a number of relevant applications to biological problems

species in living and extinct higher taxa, as these systems are special

When the field configuration is a distribution, it is unambiguously defined as
the limit of a sequence of smooth fields. The Lagrangian may or may not be a
distribution, depending on whether there is some undefined product of
distributions. Supposing that the Lagrangian is a distribution, it is
unambiguously defined as the limit of a sequence of Lagrangians. But there
still remains the question: Is the distributional Lagrangian uniquely defined
by the limiting process for the fields themselves? In this paper a general
geometrical construction is advanced to address this question. We describe
certain types of singularities, not by distribution valued tensors, but by
showing that the action functional for the singular fields is (formally)
equivalent to another action built out of \emph{smooth} fields. Thus we manage
to make the problem of the lack of a derivative disappear from a system which
gives differential equations. Certain ideas from homotopy and homology theory
turn out to be of central importance in analyzing the problem and clarifying
finer aspects of it.
  The method is applied to general relativity in first order formalism, which
gives some interesting insights into distributional geometries in that theory.
Then more general gravitational Lagrangians in first order formalism are
considered such as Lovelock terms (for which the action principle admits
space-times more singular than other higher curvature theories).

elliptical galaxies is not in doubt, given the well established relations among
electromagnetic output, black hole mass and galaxy optical luminosity. In
addition, feedback due to mechanical and thermal deposition of energy from jets
and winds emitted by the accretion disk around the central SMBH is also
expected to occur. In this paper we improve and extend the accretion and
feedback physics explored in our previous papers to include also a physically
motivated mechanical feedback. We study the evolution of an isolated elliptical
galaxy with the aid of a high-resolution 1-D hydrodynamical code, where the
cooling and heating functions include photoionization and Compton effects, and
restricting to models which include only radiative or only mechanical feedback.
We confirm that for Eddington ratios above 0.01 both the accretion and
radiative output are forced by feedback effects to be in burst mode, so that
strong intermittencies are expected at early times, while at low redshift the
explored models are characterized by smooth, very sub-Eddington mass accretion
rates punctuated by rare outbursts. However, the explored models always fail
some observational tests. If we assume the high mechanical efficiency of
10^{-2.3}, we find that most of the gas is ejected from the galaxy, the
resulting X-ray luminosity is far less than is typically observed and little
SMBH growth occurs. But models with low enough mechanical efficiency to
accomodate satisfactory SMBH growth tend to allow too strong cooling flows and
leave galaxies at z=0 with E+A spectra more frequently than is observed. We
conclude that both types of feedback are required. Models with combined
feedback are explored in a forthcoming paper [abridged]

dimensionally-regularized fixed-angle scattering amplitudes in massless gauge
theories. Our factorization is based on replacing the hard massless partons by
light-like Wilson lines, and defining gauge-invariant jet and soft functions in
dimensional regularization. In this scheme the factorized amplitude admits a
powerful symmetry: it is invariant under rescaling of individual Wilson-line
velocities. This symmetry is broken by cusp singularities in both the soft and
the eikonal jet functions. We show that the cancellation of these cusp
anomalies in any multi-leg amplitude imposes all-order constraints on the
kinematic dependence of the corresponding soft anomalous dimension, relating it
to the cusp anomalous dimension. For amplitudes with two or three hard partons
the solution is unique: the constraints fully determine the kinematic
dependence of the soft function. For amplitudes with four or more hard partons
we present a minimal solution where the soft anomalous dimension is a sum over
colour dipoles, multiplied by the cusp anomalous dimension. In this case
additional contributions to the soft anomalous dimension at three loops or
beyond are not excluded, but they are constrained to be functions of conformal
cross ratios of kinematic variables.

out detailed three-dimensional, NLTE radiative transfer calculations using the
radiative transfer code HDUST. For the input for the code we have used the most
up-to-date research on Be stars to include a physically realistic description
for the central star and the circumstellar disc. We adopt a rotationally
deformed, gravity darkened central star, surrounded by a disc whose unperturbed
state is given by a steady-state viscous decretion disc model. We further
assume that disc is in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium. Results. By adopting a
viscous decretion disc model for $\zeta$ Tauri and a rigorous solution of the
radiative transfer, we have obtained a very good fit of the time-average
properties of the disc. This provides strong theoretical evidence that the
viscous decretion disc model is the mechanism responsible for disc formation.
With the global oscillation model we have successfully fitted spatially
resolved VLTI/AMBER observations and the temporal V/R variations of the
H$\alpha$ and Br$\gamma$ lines. This result convincingly demonstrates that the
oscillation pattern in the disc is a one-armed spiral. Possible model
shortcomings, as well as suggestions for future improvements, are also
discussed.

full risk of default for the counterparty when traded with brokers or outside
clearing houses, or when embedded in other contracts such as swaps. In this
paper we focus on energy commodities and on Oil in particular. We use a hybrid
commodities-credit model to asses impact of counterparty risk in pricing
formulas, both in the gross effect of default probabilities and on the subtler
effects of credit spread volatility, commodities volatility and
credit-commodities correlation. We illustrate our general approach with a case
study based on an oil swap, showing that an accurate valuation of counterparty

stronger for the 3.0-nm superstructure than for the 2.7-nm superstructure,

associated with a uniformly selected galaxy cluster sample identified in the
8.5 square degree Bootes field of the NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey. The clusters
are distributed over a large range of redshift (0 < z < 1.5) and we identify
AGN using three different selection criteria: mid-IR color, radio luminosity,
and X-ray luminosity. Relative to the field, we note a clear overdensity of the
number of AGN within 0.5 Mpc of the cluster centers at z > 0.5. The amplitude
of this AGN overdensity increases with redshift. Although there are significant
differences between the AGN populations probed by each selection technique, the
rise in cluster AGN surface density generally increases more steeply than that
of field quasars. In particular, X-ray selected AGN are at least three times
more prevalent in clusters at 1 < z < 1.5 compared to clusters at 0.5 < z < 1.
This effect is stronger than can be explained by the evolving median richness
of our cluster sample. We thus confirm the existence of a Butcher-Oemler type
effect for AGN in galaxy clusters, with the number of AGN in clusters
increasing with redshift.

analyzed statistically, and then compared with maps of total reddening and with
models of the C+ - CO transition in H2-bearing diffuse clouds. Results: Around
Zeta Oph, 12CO emission appears in two distinct intervals of reddening centered
near EBV = 0.4 and 0.65 mag, of which < 0.2 mag is background material. Within
either interval, the integrated 12CO intensity varies up to 6-12 K-km/s
compared to 1.5 K-km/s toward Zeta Oph. Nearly 80% of the individual profiles
have velocity dispersions < 0.6 km/s, which are subsonic at the kinetic
temperature derived from H2 toward Zeta Oph, 55 K. Partly as a result, 12CO
emission exposes the internal, turbulent, supersonic (1-3 km/s) gas flows with
especial clarity in the cores of strong lines. The flows are manifested as
resolved velocity gradients in narrow, subsonically-broadened line cores.
Conclusions: The scatter between N(CO) and EBV in global, CO absorption line
surveys toward bright stars is present in the gas seen around Zeta Oph,
reflecting the extreme sensitivity of N(12CO) to ambient conditions. The
two-component nature of the optical absorption toward Zeta Oph is coincidental
and the star is occulted by a single body of gas with a complex internal
structure, not by two distinct clouds. The very bright 12CO lines in diffuse
gas arise at N(H2) ~ 10^21/cm^2 in regions of modest density n(H) ~ 200-500/cc
and somewhat more complete C+-CO conversion. Given the variety of structure in
the foreground gas, it is apparent that only large surveys of absorption
sightlines can hope to capture the intrinsic behavior of diffuse gas.

no comparable CO emission line data exist. Aims: To acquire mm-wave J=1-0 CO
emission line profiles toward a substantial sample of commonly-studied
optical/uv absorption line targets and to compare with the properties of the
absorbing gas, especially the predicted emission line strengths. Methods: Using
the ARO 12m telescope we observed mm-wavelength J=1-0 CO emission with spectral
resolution R ~ 3x10^6 and spatial resolution 1' toward a sample of 110 lines of
sight previously studied in optical/uv absorption lines of CO, \HH, CH, etc.
Results: Interstellar CO emission was detected along 65 of the 110 lines of
sight surveyed and there is a general superabundance of CO emission given the
distribution of galactic latitudes in the survey sample. Much of the emission
is optically thick or very intense and must emanate from dark clouds or warm
dense gas near HII regions. Conclusions: Judging from the statistical
superabundance of CO emission, seen also in the total line of sight reddening,
the OB star optical/uv absorption line targets must be physically associated
with the large quantities of neutral gas whose CO emission was detected, in
which case they are probably influencing the absorbing gas by heating and/or
photoionizing it. This explains why CO/H2 and 12CO/13CO ratios differ somewhat
between $uv$ and mm-wave absorption line studies. Because the lines of sight
have been preselected to have AV < 1 mag, relatively little of the associated
material actually occults the targets, making it difficult for CO emission line
observations to isolate the foreground gas contribution.

to an unusual vector Sachs-Wolfe effect, leaving a signature in the quadrupole
form $Y_{2,\pm 1}(\theta,\varphi)$ on the CMB polarization. We then derive the
details for the Thomson scattering of CMB photons for these $\Psi_{3}$ modes,
and then construct the correspondent Boltzmann equations. Based upon these
results we then qualitatively show that $\Psi_{3}$-mode vector signatures - if

order to derive the nebular chemical abundances, we apply several diagnostics
of the oxygen abundance, including R23, [NII]/[OII] and the [OIII]4363 auroral
line, which was detected in four HII regions. We find that, while inwards of
the optical edge the O/H ratio follows the radial gradient known from previous
investigations, the outer abundance trend flattens out to an approximately
constant value. The latter varies, according to the adopted diagnostic, between
12+log(O/H)=8.2 and 12+log(O/H)=8.6 (i.e. from approximately 1/3 the solar

evidence point towards a ""downsizing"" (DS) of the process of galaxy formation
over cosmic time. This behavior is sometimes termed ""anti-hierarchical"", and
contrasted with the ""bottom-up"" assembly of the dark matter structures in Cold
Dark Matter models. In this paper we address three different kinds of
observational evidence that have been described as DS: the stellar mass
assembly, star formation rate and the ages of the stellar populations in local
galaxies. We compare a broad compilation of available data-sets with the
predictions of three different semi-analytic models of galaxy formation within
the Lambda-CDM framework. In the data, we see only weak evidence at best of DS
in stellar mass and in star formation rate. We find that, when observational
errors on stellar mass and SFR are taken into account, the models acceptably
reproduce the evolution of massive galaxies, over the entire redshift range
that we consider. However, lower mass galaxies are formed too early in the
models and are too passive at late times. Thus, the models do not correctly
reproduce the DS trend in stellar mass or the archaeological DS, while they
qualitatively reproduce the mass-dependent evolution of the SFR. We demonstrate
that these discrepancies are not solely due to a poor treatment of satellite
galaxies but are mainly connected to the excessively efficient formation of
central galaxies in high-redshift haloes with circular velocities ~100-200
km/s. [abridged]

that masers at intermediate and high redshifts would be extremely rare, but
galaxies at redshifts z > 2 might be quite different from those found locally,
not least because of more frequent mergers and interaction events. Using
gravitational lensing as a tool to enable us to search higher redshifts than
would otherwise be possible, we have embarked on a survey of lensed galaxies,
looking for masers. Here we report the discovery of a water maser at redshift
2.64 in the dust- and gas-rich gravitationally lensed type 1 quasar MG

distant maser previously known. Using the locally-determined luminosity
function, the probability of finding a maser this luminous associated with any

provides an alternative to internal shocks as a mechanism for producing GRBs'

relativistically in the outflow's rest frame. Variability arises because an

a small fraction of the emitters are seen by a given observer. Models with
significant relativistic random motions require converting and maintaining a

the variability. While both models successfully produce the observed

0.49^{+0.11}_{-0.15} Mpc, consistent with its compact appearance on the sky.
This translates to a depth scatter smaller than the intrinsic, or ""cosmic"",
scatter sigma_cosmic in the SBF calibration, unlike in Virgo. As a result, we
are able to place the first tight constraints on the value of sigma_cosmic,
finding 0.06 +/- 0.01 mag, with a firm upper limit of sigma_cosmic<0.08 mag, at
least for galaxies with g-z>1.02. We also present an alternative SBF

first-principles calculations, we attribute the different measured conductance
states to distinct contact geometries at the flexible but stable N-Au bond:
conductance is low when the N-Au bond is perpendicular to the conducting
pi-system, and high otherwise. This switching mechanism, inherent to the

integrated numerically over time in such a manner that the overall structures

formation timescale in an H I cloud with N(H) ~ 4x10^{20}/cm^2 is 1-3 x 10^7
yr, nearly independent of the assumed density or H2 formation rate constant on
grains, etc. Attempts to speed up the evolution of the H2-fraction would
require densities well beyond the range usually considered typical of diffuse
gas. The calculations suggest that, under benign, quiescent conditions,
formation of H2 is favored in larger regions having moderate density,
consistent with the rather high mean kinetic temperatures measured in H2, 70-80
K. Formation of H3+ is essentially complete when H2-formation equilibrates but
the final abundance of H3+ appears more nearly at the very last instant.
Chemistry in a weakly-molecular gas has particular properties so that the
abundance patterns change appreciably as gas becomes more fully molecular,
either in model sequences or with time in a single model. One manifestation of
this is that the predicted abundance of H3+ is much more weakly dependent on
the cosmic-ray ionization rate when n(H2)/n(H) < 0.05. In general, high
abundances of H3+ do not enhance the abundances of other species (e.g. HCO+)
but late-time OH formation proceeds most vigourously in more diffuse regions
having modest density, extinction and H2 fraction and somewhat higher
fractional ionization, suggesting that atypically high OH/H2 abundance ratios

maintained only by a high ionization rate of H_2. Cosmic rays are the dominant
ionization mechanism in this environment, so the large ionization rate implies
a high cosmic-ray flux, and a large amount of energy residing in cosmic rays.
In this paper we find that the standard propagated cosmic-ray spectrum predicts
an ionization rate much lower than that inferred from H_3^+. Low-energy (~10
MeV) cosmic rays are the most efficient at ionizing hydrogen, but cannot be
directly detected; consequently, an otherwise unobservable enhancement of the
low-energy cosmic-ray flux offers a plausible explanation for the H_3^+
results. Beyond ionization, cosmic rays also interact with the interstellar
medium by spalling atomic nuclei and exciting atomic nuclear states. These
processes produce the light elements Li, Be, and B, as well as gamma-ray lines.
To test the consequences of an enhanced low-energy cosmic-ray flux, we adopt
two physically-motivated cosmic-ray spectra which by construction reproduce the
ionization rate inferred in diffuse clouds, and investigate the implications of
these spectra on dense cloud ionization rates, light element abundances,
gamma-ray fluxes, and energetics. One spectrum proposed here provides an
explanation for the high ionization rate seen in diffuse clouds while still
appearing to be broadly consistent with other observables, but the shape of
this spectrum suggests that supernovae remnants may not be the predominant
accelerators of low-energy cosmic rays.

Fokker--Planck (SFP) approach to sample from the posterior density. Stationary
Fokker--Planck sampling generalizes the Gibbs sampler algorithm for arbitrary
and unknown conditional densities. By the SFP procedure approximate analytical
expressions for the conditionals and marginals of the posterior can be
constructed. At each stage of SFP, the approximate conditionals are used to
define a Gibbs sampling process, which is convergent to the full joint
posterior. By the analytical marginals efficient learning methods in the
context of Artificial Neural Networks are outlined. Off--line and incremental
Bayesian inference and Maximum Likelihood Estimation from the posterior is
performed in classification and regression examples. A comparison of SFP with
other Monte Carlo strategies in the general problem of sampling from arbitrary
densities is also presented. It is shown that SFP is able to jump large
low--probabilty regions without the need of a careful tuning of any step size
parameter. In fact, the SFP method requires only a small set of meaningful
parameters which can be selected following clear, problem--independent
guidelines. The computation cost of SFP, measured in terms of loss function
evaluations, grows linearly with the given model's dimension.

models of which universal (high scale) gaugino masses are a limiting case. We
improve on previous methods to define an analytic expression for the metric on
signature space and use it to study one-parameter deviations from universality
in the gaugino sector, randomizing over other soft supersymmetry-breaking
parameters. We put forward three ensembles of observables targeted at the
physics of the gaugino sector, allowing for a determination of this
non-universality parameter without reconstructing individual mass eigenvalues
or the soft supersymmetry-breaking gaugino masses themselves. In this
controlled environment we find that approximately 80% of the supersymmetric

non-universality in the gaugino mass sector at the 10% level with an integrated

detectors are significantly more susceptible than NbN to thermal instability
(latching) at high bias. We show that the devices can be stabilized by reducing
the input resistance of the readout. Nb detectors optimized in this way are
shown to have approximately 2/3 the reset time of similar large-active-area NbN

halo mass of the host group (Mhalo), and (3) their halo-centric position. We
establish and thoroughly test a GALFIT-based pipeline to fit 2D Sersic models
to SDSS data. We find that the fitting results are most sensitive to the
background sky level determination and strongly recommend using the SDSS global
value. We find that uncertainties in the background translate into a strong
covariance between the total magnitude, half-light size (r50), and Sersic index
(n), especially for bright/massive galaxies. We find that n depends strongly on
Mstar for CENs, but only weakly or not at all on Mhalo. Less (more) massive
CENs tend to be disk (spheroid)-like over the full Mhalo range. Likewise, there
is a clear r50-Mstar relation for CENs, with separate slopes for disks and
spheroids. When comparing CENs with satellite galaxies (SATs), we find that low
mass (<10e10.75 Msun/h^2) SATs have larger median n than CENs of similar Mstar.
Low mass, late-type SATs have moderately smaller r50 than late-type CENs of the
same Mstar. However, we find no size differences between spheroid-like CENs and
SATs, and no structural differences between CENs and SATs matched in both mass
and colour. The similarity of massive SATs and CENs shows that this distinction
has no significant impact on the structure of spheroids. We conclude that Mstar
is the most fundamental property determining the basic structure of a galaxy.
The lack of a clear n-Mhalo relation rules out a distinct group mass for
producing spheroids, and the responsible morphological transformation processes
must occur at the centres of groups spanning a wide range of masses. (abridged)

synthesize a combinatorial number of imaginary events, (4) dynamically change
its mental set to match a combinatorial number of contexts? We propose a
uniform answer to (1)-(4) based on the general postulate that the human
neocortex processes symbolic information in a ""nonclassical"" way. Instead of
manipulating symbols in a read/write memory, as the classical symbolic systems
do, it manipulates the states of dynamical memory representing different
temporary attributes of immovable symbolic structures stored in a long-term
memory. The approach is formalized as the concept of E-machine. Intuitively, an
E-machine is a system that deals mainly with characteristic functions
representing subsets of memory pointers rather than the pointers themselves.
This nonclassical symbolic paradigm is Turing universal, and, unlike the
classical one, is efficiently implementable in homogeneous neural networks with
temporal modulation topologically resembling that of the neocortex.

full disk images from the Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) on SOHO
over solar cycle 23 to measure the perimeter of polar coronal holes as they
appear on the limbs. Perimeter tracing minimizes line-of-sight obscurations
caused by the emitting plasma of the various wavelengths by taking measurements
at the solar limb. Perimeter tracing also allows for the polar rotation period
to emerge organically from the data as 33 days. We have called this the Harvey
rotation rate and count Harvey rotations starting 4 January 1900. From the
measured perimeter, we are then able to fit a curve to the data and derive an
area within the line of best fit. We observe the area of the northern polar
hole area in 1996, at the beginning of solar cycle 23, to be about 4.2% of the
total solar surface area and about 3.6% in 2007. The area of the southern polar
hole is observed to be about 4.0% in 1996 and about 3.4% in 2007. Thus, both

as a result of folding the set of rational places of a function field using
certain elements (automorphisms) from the Galois group of the extension. This
work is an extension of Folded Reed Solomon codes to the setting of Algebraic
Geometric codes. We describe two constructions based on this framework
depending on if the order of the automorphism used to fold the code is large or
small compared to the block length. When the automorphism is of large order,
the codes have polynomially bounded list size in the worst case. This
construction gives codes of rate $R$ over an alphabet of size independent of
block length that can correct a fraction of $1-R-\epsilon$ errors subject to
the existence of asymptotically good towers of function fields with large
automorphisms. The second construction addresses the case when the order of the
element used to fold is small compared to the block length. In this case a
heuristic analysis shows that for a random received word, the expected list
size and the running time of the decoding algorithm are bounded by a polynomial
in the block length. When applied to the Garcia-Stichtenoth tower, this yields
codes of rate $R$ over an alphabet of size
$(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2})^{O(\frac{1}{\epsilon})}$, that can correct a fraction

Galactic latitudes can be modeled by electron distributions and large-scale
magnetic fields. The statistical properties of the magnetized interstellar
medium at various scales have been studied using rotation measure data and
polarization data. In the Galactic center, the non-thermal filaments indicate
poloidal fields. There is no consensus on the field strength, maybe mG, maybe
tens of uG. The polarized dust emission and much enhanced rotation measures of
background radio sources are probably related to toroidal fields. In the
Galactic halo, the antisymmetric RM sky reveals large-scale toroidal fields
with reversed directions above and below the Galactic plane. Magnetic fields
from all parts of our Galaxy are connected to form a global field structure.
More observations are needed to explore the untouched regions and delineate how
fields in different parts are connected.

corrections are solely due to momentum-nonconserving processes that change the
relative number of left- and right-moving electrons. This leads to a
suppression of the conductance for increasing temperature or voltage. The size
of the suppression is estimated for a realistic saddle-point potential, and is
largest in the beginning of the conductance plateau. For large magnetic field,
interaction effects are strongly suppressed by the Pauli principle, and hence
the first spin-split conductance plateau has a much weaker interaction
correction. For the nonperturbative calculations, we use a self-consistent
nonequilibrium Green's function approach, which suggests that the conductance
saturates at elevated temperatures. These results are consistent with many

way in which burst take place, and the time of separation between these bursts.

shift in position space which entangles the coin and position degrees of
freedom of the walker. After several steps, the coin-position entanglement
(CPE) converges to a well defined value which depends on the initial state. In
this work we provide an analytical method which allows for the exact
calculation of the asymptotic reduced density operator and the corresponding
CPE for a discrete-time quantum walk on a two-dimensional lattice. We use the
von Neumann entropy of the reduced density operator as an entanglement measure.
The method is applied to the case of a Hadamard walk for which the dependence
of the resulting CPE on initial conditions is obtained. Initial states leading
to maximum or minimum CPE are identified and the relation between the coin or
position entanglement present in the initial state of the walker and the final
level of CPE is discussed. The CPE obtained from separable initial states
satisfies an additivity property in terms of CPE of the corresponding
one-dimensional cases. Non-local initial conditions are also considered and we
find that the extreme case of an initial uniform position distribution leads to

general, in previous works in the literature about the SBGWs, old Cosmic

problem of how the SBGWs and f(R) gravity (where f(R) is a function of the
Ricci scalar R) can be related, showing, vice versa, that a revealed SBGWs
could be a powerful probe for a given theory of gravity. In this way, it will
also be shown that the conform treatment of SBGWs can be used to parametrize in
a natural way f(R) theories. Some interesting examples which have been recently
discussed in the literature will be also analysed. The presence and the
potential detection of the SBGWs is quite important in the framework of the
debate on high-frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs) too. Recently, the
importance of HFGWs has been emphasized in some papers in the literature.

analysed in detail for rational values of the noncommutativity parameter theta

noncommutative field theory (NCFT) and a non-abelian theory of twisted fields
on ordinary space. We focus on a particular conformal field theory (CFT), the
one obtained by means of the m-reduction procedure (V. Marotta, J. Phys. A 26

a correspondence and to clarify its role in the physics of strongly correlated

carrying out a perturbative computation, we demonstrate that the spectral
function corresponding to this correlator is relatively flat at small

continuation from Euclidean lattice data susceptible to severe systematic

that such a crossing does not correspond to a phase transition, but rather to a

around $700 nm$, is a characteristic of vegetation spectra, and can therefore
be used as a biomarker if it can be detected in an unresolved extrasolar
Earth-like planet integrated reflectance spectrum. Here we investigate the
potential for detection of vegetation spectra during the last Quaternary
climatic extrema, the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the Holocene optimum, for
which past climatic simulations have been made. By testing the VRE
detectability during these extrema when Earth's climate and biomes maps were
different from today, we are able to test the vegetation detectability on a
terrestrial planet different from our modern Earth. Data from the Biome3.5
model have been associated to visible GOME spectra for each biome and cloud
cover to derive Earth's integrated spectra for given Earth phases and observer
positions. The VRE is then measured. Results show that the vegetation remains
detectable during the last climatic extrema. Compared to current Earth, the
Holocene optimum with a greener Sahara slightly increases the mean VRE on one
hand, while on the other hand, the large ice cap over the northern Hemisphere
during the LGM decreases vegetation detectability. We finally discuss the
detectability of the VRE in the context of recently proposed space missions.

such as convection, to drive a weak differential rotation within the core. The
force balance in the Earth's core is very unlike classical astrophysical
applications of the MRI (such as gaseous disks around stars). Here, the weak
differential rotation in the Earth core yields an instability by its
constructive interaction with the planet's much larger rotation rate. The
resulting destabilising mechanism is just strong enough to counteract
stabilizing resistive effects, and produce growth on geophysically interesting
timescales. We give a simple physical explanation of the instability, and show
that it relies on a force balance appropriate to the Earth's core, known as

present a new method for the pricing of CPPIs and options on CPPIs, which is
much faster and more accurate than the usual Monte-Carlo method. Provided the
underlying follows a homogeneous process, the path-dependent CPPI strategy is
reformulated into a Markov process in one variable, which allows to use
efficient linear algebra techniques. Tail events, which are crucial in the
pricing are handled smoothly. We incorporate in this framework linear
thresholds, profit lock-in, performance coupons... The American exercise of
open-ended CPPIs is handled naturally through backward propagation. Finally we
use our pricing scheme to study the influence of various features on the gap

in cataclysmic variables (CVs) or in low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), which
leads to dwarf nova and soft X-ray transient outbursts. It has been suggested
that this thermal/viscous instability can account for the long term variability
of AGNs. We test this assertion by presenting a systematic study of the
application of the disk instability model (DIM) to AGNs. We are using the
adaptative grid numerical code we have developed in the context of CVs,
enabling us to fully resolve the radial structure of the disk. We show that,
because in AGN disks the Mach numbers are very large, the heating and cooling
fronts are so narrow that they cannot be resolved by the numerical codes that
have been used until now. In addition, these fronts propagate on time scales
much shorter than the viscous time. As a result, a sequence of heating and
cooling fronts propagate back and forth in the disk, leading only to small
variations of the accretion rate onto the black hole, with short quiescent
states occurring for very low mass transfer rates only. Truncation of the inner
part of the disk by e.g. an ADAF does not alter this result, but enables longer
quiescent states. Finally we discuss the effects of irradiation by the central
X-ray source, and show that, even for extremely high irradiation efficiencies,
outbursts are not a natural outcome of the model.

the very high energy (VHE) radiation from the BL Lac object 1ES 0806+524,
recently detected by VERITAS. The efficiency of the inverse Compton scattering
(ICS) of the accretion disk thermal photons against rotationally accelerated
electrons is examined. By studying the dynamics of centrifugally induced
outflows and by taking into account a cooling process due to the ICS, we
estimate the maximum attainable Lorentz factors of particles and derive
corresponding energetic characteristics of the emission. Examining physically
reasonable parameters, by considering the narrow interval of inclination angles
(0.7^o-0.95^o) of magnetic field lines with respect to the rotation axis, it is
shown that the centrifugally accelerated electrons may lead to the
observational pattern of the VHE emission, if the density of electrons is in a
certain interval.

stellar content thus provides a basis for studying the star formation history
into recent times and constraining several stellar population properties, such
as the present day mass function, the initial mass function and the binary
fraction. To better characterize the pre-main sequence population, we present a
new set of model stellar evolutionary tracks for this evolutionary phase with
metallicity appropriate for the Small Magellanic Cloud (Z = 0.004). We use a
stellar population synthesis code, which takes into account a full range of
stellar evolution phases to derive our best estimate for the star formation
history in the region by comparing observed and synthetic color-magnitude
diagrams. The derived present day mass function for NGC 602 is consistent with
that resulting from the synthetic diagrams. The star formation rate in the
region has increased with time on a scale of tens of Myr, reaching $0.3-0.7
\times 10^{-3} M_\odot yr^{-1}$ in the last 2.5 Myr, comparable to what is
found in Galactic OB associations. Star formation is most complete in the main

hole binaries (and neutron stars) can be explained by Lense-Thirring
precession. This has been proposed many times in the past, and simple, single
radius models can qualitatively match the observed increase in QPO frequency by
decreasing a characteristic radius, as predicted by the truncated disc models.
However, this also predicts that the frequency is strongly dependent on spin,
and gives a maximum frequency at the last stable orbit which is generally much
higher than the remarkably constant maximum frequency at ~10Hz observed in all
black hole binaries. The key aspect of our model which makes it match these
observations is that the precession is of a radially extended region of the hot
inner flow. The outer radius is set by the truncation radius of the disc as
above, but the inner radius lies well outside of the last stable orbit at the
point where numerical simulations show that the density drops off sharply for a
misaligned flow. Physically motivated analytic estimates for this inner radius
show that it increases with a_*, decreasing the expected frequency in a way
which almost completely cancels the expected increase with spin. This ties the
maximum predicted frequency to around 10Hz irrespective of a_*, as observed.
This is the first QPO model which explains both frequencies and spectrum in the
context of a well established geometry for the accretion flow.

Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations are performed to compute the difference in
Coulomb energies of the two states which determines the amplification of
variations in alpha into variations of the transition frequency. The kinetic
energies are also calculated which reflect a possible variation in the nucleon

use of density-matrix functionals.
  As the two states differ mainly in the orbit occupied by the last unpaired
neutron the Coulomb energy difference results from a change in the nuclear
polarization of the proton distribution. This effect turns out to be rather
small and to depend on the nuclear model, the amplification varies between
about -4 x 10^4 and +4 x 10^4. Therefore much more effort must be put into the
improvement of the nuclear models before one can draw conclusions from a

covariance-based methods have been used to identify correlation between amino
acid positions in interacting proteins. However, these methods have an
important shortcoming, in that they cannot distinguish between directly and
indirectly correlated residues. We developed a method that combines covariance
analysis with global inference analysis, adopted from use in statistical
physics. Applied to a set of >2,500 representatives of the bacterial
two-component signal transduction system, the combination of covariance with
global inference successfully and robustly identified residue pairs that are
proximal in space without resorting to ad hoc tuning parameters, both for
heterointeractions between sensor kinase (SK) and response regulator (RR)
proteins and for homointeractions between RR proteins. The spectacular success
of this approach illustrates the effectiveness of the global inference approach
in identifying direct interaction based on sequence information alone. We
expect this method to be applicable soon to interaction surfaces between
proteins present in only 1 copy per genome as the number of sequenced genomes
continues to expand. Use of this method could significantly increase the
potential targets for therapeutic intervention, shed light on the mechanism of
protein-protein interaction, and establish the foundation for the accurate
prediction of interacting protein partners.

audience response systems in the literature have shown their success:
encouraging participation of the students as well as immediate feedback to
answers to the whole group for evaluational purposes of the teacher. However,
commercial systems are relatively expensive and the number of students in such
a teaching-learning scenario is limited. ARSBO solves these problems. Using the
Internet (e.g. in computer rooms or by wireless Internet access) there are no
special costs and the number of participating students is not limited. ARSBO is
very easy to use for students as well as for the construction of new questions
with possible answers and for the visualization of statistical results to
questions.

two dimensions in the Boussinesq limit. The density variation length scale is
chosen to be four times smaller than the velocity variation length scale so
that Holmboe or Kelvin-Helmholtz unstable modes are present depending on the
choice of the global Richardson number Ri. Three different values of Ri were
examined Ri =0.2, 2, 20. The flows for the three examined values are all
unstable due to different modes namely: the Kelvin-Helmholtz mode for Ri=0.2,
the first Holmboe mode for Ri=2, and the second Holmboe mode for Ri=20 that has
been discovered recently and it is the first time that it is examined in the
non-linear stage. It is found that the amplitude of the velocity perturbation
of the second Holmboe mode at the non-linear stage is smaller but comparable to
first Holmboe mode. The increase of the potential energy however due to the
second Holmboe modes is greater than that of the first mode. The
Kelvin-Helmholtz mode is larger by two orders of magnitude in kinetic energy
than the Holmboe modes and about ten times larger in potential energy than the
Holmboe modes. The results in this paper suggest that although mixing is
suppressed at large Richardson numbers it is not negligible, and turbulent
mixing processes in strongly stratified environments can not be excluded.

microfluidic devices with microwave dielectric heating. Water absorbs microwave
power more efficiently than polymers, glass, and oils due to its permanent
molecular dipole moment that has a large dielectric loss at GHz frequencies.
The relevant heat capacity of the system is a single thermally isolated
picoliter drop of water and this enables very fast thermal cycling. We
demonstrate microwave dielectric heating in a microfluidic device that
integrates a flow-focusing drop maker, drop splitters, and metal electrodes to
locally deliver microwave power from an inexpensive, commercially available 3.0
GHz source and amplifier. The temperature of the drops is measured by observing
the temperature dependent fluorescence intensity of cadmium selenide
nanocrystals suspended in the water drops. We demonstrate characteristic
heating times as short as 15 ms to steady-state temperatures as large as 30
degrees C above the base temperature of the microfluidic device. Many common
biological and chemical applications require rapid and local control of
temperature, such as PCR amplification of DNA, and can benefit from this new
technique.

  at Highway Bottlenecks","research report",,,,"nlin.CG nlin.PS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A bottleneck simulation of road traffic on a loop, using the deterministic
cellular automata (CA) Nagel-Schreckenberg model with zero dawdling
probability, reveals three types of stationary wave solutions. They consist of
i) two shock waves, one at each bottleneck boundary, ii) one shock wave at the
boundary and one on the ""open"" road, and iii) the trivial solution, i.e.
homogeneous, uniform flow. These solutions are selected dynamically from a
range of kinematicly permissible stationary shocks. This is similar in fashion
to the wave selection in a bottleneck simulation of the optimal-velocity (OV)
model, which is explained by a travelling wave phase-plane analysis of the
corresponding continuum model. It is yet another strong indication that CA and
OV models share certain underlying dynamics, although the former are discrete
in space and time while the latter are continuous.

slow and dense wind. They are often considered to be the more massive counter
parts of Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars. While the AGB mass loss is linked
to their strong pulsations, the RSG are often only weakly variable. Aim: To
study the conditions at the base of the wind, by determining the dust
composition in a sample of RSG. The dust composition is thought to be sensitive
to the density, temperature and acceleration at the base of the wind. Method:
We compile a sample of 27 RSG infrared spectra (ISO-SWS) and supplement these
with photometric measurements to obtain the full spectral energy distribution
(SED). These data are modelled using a dust radiative transfer code. The
results are scrutinised for correlations. Results: We find (1) strong
correlations between dust composition, mass-loss rate and stellar luminosity,
roughly in agreement with the theoretical dust condensation sequence, (2) the
need for a continuous (near-)IR dust opacity and tentatively propose amorphous
carbon, and (3) significant differences with AGB star winds: presence of PAHs,
absence of 'the' 13 micron band, and a lack of strong water bands. Conclusions:
Dust condensation in RSG is found to experience a similar freeze-out process as
in AGB stars. Together with the positive effect of the stellar luminosity on
the mass-loss rate, this suggests that radiation pressure on dust grains is an
important ingredient in the driving mechanism. Still, differences with AGB
stars are manifold and thus the winds of RSG deserve separate studies.

towards any dense stellar field. The densest parts of the Galactic spiral arms
have been monitored to maximize the microlensing signal expected from the stars
of the Galactic disk and bulge. 12.9 million stars have been monitored during 7
seasons towards 4 directions in the Galactic plane, away from the Galactic
center. A total of 27 microlensing event candidates have been found. Estimates
of the optical depths from the 22 best events are provided. A first order
interpretation shows that simple Galactic models with a standard disk and an
elongated bulge are in agreement with our observations. We find that the
average microlensing optical depth towards the complete EROS-cataloged stars of
the spiral arms is $\bar{\tau} =0.51\pm .13\times 10^{-6}$, a number that is
stable when the selection criteria are moderately varied. As the EROS catalog
is almost complete up to $I_C=18.5$, the optical depth estimated for the
sub-sample of bright target stars with $I_C<18.5$ ($\bar{\tau}=0.39\pm
>.11\times 10^{-6}$) is easier to interpret. The set of microlensing events
that we have observed is consistent with a simple Galactic model. A more
precise interpretation would require either a better knowledge of the distance
distribution of the target stars, or a simulation based on a Galactic model.
For this purpose, we define and discuss the concept of optical depth for a
given catalog or for a limiting magnitude.
