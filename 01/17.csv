amplitudes in N=8 supergravity, obtained from solving the supersymmetric
on-shell recursion relations. The formula is patterned after one recently
obtained for all tree amplitudes in N=4 super Yang-Mills which involves nested
sums of dual superconformal invariants. We find that all graviton amplitudes
can be written in terms of exactly the same structure of nested sums with two
modifications: the dual superconformal invariants are promoted from N=4 to N=8
superspace in the simplest manner possible--by squaring them--and certain
additional non-dual conformal gravity dressing factors (independent of the
superspace coordinates) are inserted into the nested sums. To illustrate the
procedure we give explicit closed-form formulas for all NMHV, NNMHV and NNNMV
gravity superamplitudes.

flavors. Inspired by the well known fact that the U_A(1) anomaly could induce
first order phase transitions, we study the effect of the possible restoration
of the U_A(1) symmetry at finite density. In particular, we explore the link
between the U_A(1) restoration and the recent lattice QCD results of de
Forcrand and Philipsen, in which the first order phase transition region near
zero chemical potential (mu) shrinks in the quark mass and mu space when mu is
increased. Starting from the Ginzburg-Landau theory for general discussions, we
then use the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model for quantitative studies. With the
partial U_A(1) restoration modeled by the density dependent 't Hooft
interaction, we fit the shrinking of the critical surface found in de Forcrand
and Philipsen's lattice calculation at low mu. At higher mu, the critical
surface might shrink or expand, depending on the scenarios. This raises the
possibility that despite the shrinking of the critical surface at lower mu, the
QCD critical end point might still exist due to the expansion at higher mu. In
this case, very high precision lattice data will be needed to detect the
back-bending of the critical surface with the currently available analytic
continuation or Taylor expansion approaches. Lattice computations could,
however, test whether the U_A(1) restoration is responsible for the shrinking
of the critical surface by computing eta' mass or the topological
susceptibility at small mu.

hydrogen (HI) in different galaxies from a phenomenological and theoretical
viewpoint. First, the local H2-mass function (MF) is estimated from the local
CO-luminosity function (LF) of the FCRAO Extragalactic CO-Survey, adopting a
variable CO-to-H2 conversion fitted to nearby observations. This implies an
average H2-density Omega_H2=(6.9+-2.7) 10^5/h and Omega_H2/Omega_HI=0.26+-0.11
in the local Universe. Second, we investigate the correlations between Rmol and
global galaxy properties in a sample of 245 local galaxies. Based on these
correlations we introduce four phenomenological models for Rmol, which we apply
to estimate H2-masses for each HI-galaxy in the HIPASS catalogue. The resulting
H2-MFs (one for each model for Rmol) are compared to the reference H2-MF
derived from the CO-LF, thus allowing us to determine the Bayesian evidence of
each model and to identify a clear best model, in which, for spiral galaxies,
Rmol negatively correlates with both galaxy Hubble type and total gas mass.
Third, we derive a theoretical model for Rmol for regular galaxies based on an

product state capacity of a noisy quantum channel with memory is investigated.
A forgetful noise-memory channel is constructed by Markov switching between two
depolarizing channels which introduces non-Markovian noise correlations between
successive channel uses. This function of a Markov process can be reformulated
as an algebraic measure. This framework provides an expression for the
asymptotic entropy rate and thus enables the calculation of the classical
capacity. The effects of the hidden-Markovian memory on the capacity are
explored. An increase in noise-correlations is found to increase the capacity.

interest in combinatorics and randomness extraction. (A) We show that every
Kakeya set (a set of points that contains a line in every direction) in
$\F_q^n$ must be of size at least $q^n/2^n$. This bound is tight to within a $2
+ o(1)$ factor for every $n$ as $q \to \infty$, compared to previous bounds
that were off by exponential factors in $n$. (B) We give improved randomness
extractors and ""randomness mergers"". Mergers are seeded functions that take as
input $\Lambda$ (possibly correlated) random variables in $\{0,1\}^N$ and a
short random seed and output a single random variable in $\{0,1\}^N$ that is
statistically close to having entropy $(1-\delta) \cdot N$ when one of the
$\Lambda$ input variables is distributed uniformly. The seed we require is only
$(1/\delta)\cdot \log \Lambda$-bits long, which significantly improves upon
previous construction of mergers. (C) Using our new mergers, we show how to
construct randomness extractors that use logarithmic length seeds while
extracting $1 - o(1)$ fraction of the min-entropy of the source.
  The ""method of multiplicities"", as used in prior work, analyzed subsets of
vector spaces over finite fields by constructing somewhat low degree
interpolating polynomials that vanish on every point in the subset {\em with
high multiplicity}. The typical use of this method involved showing that the
interpolating polynomial also vanished on some points outside the subset, and
then used simple bounds on the number of zeroes to complete the analysis. Our
augmentation to this technique is that we prove, under appropriate conditions,
that the interpolating polynomial vanishes {\em with high multiplicity} outside
the set. This novelty leads to significantly tighter analyses.

in accelerated populations is highlighted, focusing on how spectra above 1 MeV
can probe the field obliquity in GRB internal shocks, and the character of
hydromagnetic turbulence in their environs. When encompassing the MeV-band
spectral break, fits to BATSE/EGRET burst data indicate that the preponderance
of electrons responsible for the prompt emission reside in an intrinsically

generated in acceleration simulations; potential resolutions of this conflict
such as the action of self-absorption are mentioned. Spectral modeling also
suggests that the synchrotron mechanism is favored over synchrotron
self-Compton scenarios due to the latter's typically broad curvature near the
peak. Such diagnostics will be enhanced by the broadband spectral coverage of

interaction with the hot halo gas, this freshly accreted cold gas settles into
a large disk-like system, not necessarily aligned to an older stellar
component, that undergoes fragmentation and subsequent star formation, forming
large clumps in the mass range 10^7-10^9 M_sun. Galaxy formation is a complex
process at this important epoch when most of the central baryons are being
acquired through a range of different mechanisms - we highlight that a rapid
mass loading epoch is required to fuel the fragmentation taking place in the
massive arms in the outskirts of extended disks, an accretion mode that occurs
naturally in the hierarchical assembly process at early epochs.

realization of this generalization (for instance, in 3+1 dimensions) amounts to
introducing wave functions that depend on elements of the Poincare group $G$. A
complete set of transformations that test the symmetries of an orientable
object and of the embedding space belongs to the group $\Pi =G\times G$. All
such transformations can be studied by considering a generalized regular
representation of $G$ in the space of scalar functions on the group, $f(x,z)$,
that depend on the Minkowski space points $x\in G/Spin(3,1)$ as well as on the
orientation variables given by the elements $z$ of a matrix $Z\in Spin(3,1)$.
In particular, the field $f(x,z)$ is a generating function of usual spin-tensor
multicomponent fields. In the theory under consideration, there are four
different types of spinors, and an orientable object is characterized by ten
quantum numbers. We study the corresponding relativistic wave equations and
their symmetry properties.

some modulus. Both the capacity of wrapping quantization and the capacity

gaussian and relatively small, the capacity of saturation quantization is shown

have observed unsaturated, narrow absorption in OI and SiII together with
mildly saturated CII absorption at high radial velocities (|v_LSR|=100-320

attractive interactions and no disorder. If time-reversal symmetry is absent,
it is possible to obtain incompressible insulating states in addition to the
superfluid at zero temperature. The superfluid-insulator phase transition is
found to be second order in type-II systems using a perturbative analysis of
Cooper pairing instability in quantum Hall states of unpaired fermions. We
obtain the pairing phase diagram as a function of chemical potential (density)
and temperature. However, a more careful analysis presented here reveals that
the pairing quantum phase transition is always preempted by another transition
into a strongly correlated normal state which retains Cooper pairing and cannot
be smoothly connected to the quantum Hall state of unpaired fermions. Such a
normal phase can be qualitatively viewed as a liquid of vortices, although it
may acquire conventional broken symmetries. Even if it did not survive at
finite temperatures its influence would be felt through strong quantum
fluctuations below a crossover temperature scale. These conclusions directly
apply to fermionic ultra-cold atom systems near unitarity, but are likely
relevant for the properties of other strongly correlated superfluids as well,
including high temperature superconductors.

the halo implies at least some of the population is ancient. Although it is
possible to obtain the detailed star formation history of the M33 halo via deep
photometry, this has not been done to date. M31 hosts a traditional bulge that
is apparently dominated by stars older than 10 Gyr. Deep photometry of the M31

Combining that approach with a recent one (due to Antony Bahri, Martin
Bendersky, Fred Cohen and the first author) we study here the intersections of
k>2 quadrics and we identify very general families of such manifolds that are
diffeomorphic to connected sums of sphere products. These include those
moment-angle manifolds for which the result was conjectured by Frederic Bosio

result for the case k=2 is obtained.
  Two new sections contain results not included in the first version of this
article: Section 2 describes the topological change on the manifolds after the
operations of cutting off a vertex or an edge of the associated polytope, which
can be combined in a special way with the previos results to produce new
infinite families of manifolds that are connected sums of sphere products. In
other cases we get slightly more complicated manifolds: with this we solve
another question by Bosio-Meersseman about the manifold associated to the
truncated cube.

dispensable or even incapable of carrying activity under certain circumstances.
Yet, the mechanisms as well as the range of conditions and phenotypes
associated with this behavior remain very poorly understood. Here we predict
computationally and analytically that any organism evolving to maximize growth
rate, ATP production, or any other linear function of metabolic fluxes tends to
significantly reduce the number of active metabolic reactions compared to
typical non-optimal states. The reduced number appears to be constant across
the microbial species studied and just slightly larger than the minimum number
required for the organism to grow at all. We show that this massive spontaneous
reaction silencing is triggered by the irreversibility of a large fraction of
the metabolic reactions and propagates through the network as a cascade of
inactivity. Our results help explain existing experimental data on
intracellular flux measurements and the usage of latent pathways, shedding new
light on microbial evolution, robustness, and versatility for the execution of
specific biochemical tasks. In particular, the identification of optimal
reaction activity provides rigorous ground for an intriguing knockout-based
method recently proposed for the synthetic recovery of metabolic function.

builds up above the HeII ionization edge. Unlike the background responsible for
HI ionizations, this field should be highly variable, thanks to the scarcity of
bright quasars and the relatively short attenuation lengths (~50 Mpc) of these
high-energy photons. Recent observations of the HeII and HI Lyman-alpha forests
show that this background does indeed vary strongly, with substantial
fluctuations on scales as small as ~2 Mpc. Here we show that such spatial
fluctuation scales are naturally expected in any model in which the sources are
as rare as bright quasars, so long as the attenuation length is relatively
small. The correlation length itself is comparable to the attenuation length
(~10 Mpc) for the most plausible physical scenarios, but we find
order-of-magnitude fluctuations on all scales smaller than ~6 Mpc. Moreover,
aliasing along the one-dimensional skewers probed by the HeII and HI
Lyman-alpha forests exaggerates these variations, so that order-of-magnitude
fluctuations should be observed on all scales smaller than ~20 Mpc. Complex
radiative transfer is therefore not required to explain the observed
fluctuations, at least at the level of current data.

full survey, scheduled for completion in 2010, will map an effective volume
V_eff ~ 1 Gpc^3 (evaluated at a scale k = 0.15 h/Mpc) and will measure the

for the sake of simplicity, our model assumes no direct link between the two
end nodes of each pair implying that all communication must go through the
relay node (i.e., the MIMO switch). Assuming a delay-limited scenario, the
fundamental limits in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime is analyzed
using the diversity multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) framework. Our results sheds
light on the structure of optimal transmission schemes and the gain offered by
the relay node in two distinct cases, namely reciprocal and non-reciprocal
channels (between the relay and end-users). In particular, the existence of a
relay node, equipped with a sufficient number of antennas, is shown to increase
the multiplexing gain; as compared with the traditional fully connected K-pair
interference channel. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first known
example where adding a relay node results in enlarging the pre-log factor of
the sum rate. Moreover, for the case of reciprocal channels, it is shown that,
when the relay has a number of antennas at least equal to the sum of antennas
of all the users, static time allocation of decode and forward (DF) type
schemes is optimal. On the other hand, in the non-reciprocal scenario, we
establish the optimality of dynamic decode and forward in certain relevant
scenarios.

per DMPA at the interface is saturated at concentrations that exceed

and associations to study the stellar mass dependent dispersal of circumstellar
disks. All clusters older than ~3 Myr show a decrease in disk fraction with
increasing stellar mass for Solar to higher mass stars. This result is
significant at about the 1 $\sigma$ level in each cluster. For the complete set
of clusters we reject the null hypothesis--that Solar and intermediate-mass
stars lose their disks at the same rate--with 95-99.9% confidence. To interpret
this behaviour, we investigate the impact of grain growth, binary companions,
and photoevaporation on the evolution of disk signatures. Changes in grain
growth timescales at fixed disk temperature may explain why early-type stars
with IR excesses appear to evolve faster than their later-type counterparts.
Little evidence that binary companions affect disk evolution suggests that
photoevaporation is the more likely mechanism for disk dispersal. A simple
photoevaporation model provides a good fit to the observed disk fractions for
Solar and intermediate-mass stars. Although the current mass-dependent disk
dispersal signal is not strong, larger and more complete samples of clusters
with ages of 3-5 Myr can improve the significance and provide better tests of
theoretical models. In addition, the orbits of extra-Solar planets can
constrain models of disk dispersal and migration. We suggest that the signature
of stellar mass dependent disk dispersal due to photoevaporation may be present
in the orbits of observed extra Solar planets. Planets orbiting hosts more
massive than ~1.6 Msun may have larger orbits because the disks in which they
formed were dispersed before they could migrate.

interest is defined by a function and a lower dimensional set consisting of the

assumed to be a `small' function almost everywhere except on sets where it
concentrates as a singular measure. This is the case, for instance, in crack
detection from fracture mechanics or in certain digital image segmentation

free-discontinuity problem in the discrete setting can be re-formulated as that
of finding a derivative vector with small components at all but a few entries

in the field of `sparse recovery', where vectors with a small number of
dominating components in absolute value are recovered from a few given linear
measurements via the minimization of related energy functionals. Several
iterative thresholding algorithms that intertwine gradient-type iterations with

zero bias the differential conductance versus bias voltage possesses a strong
dip. The zero-bias anomaly in the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) is affected

In presence of a static external magnetic field the differential conductance

of two distinct zones: an inner relativistic outflow, which we identify with

self-collimate efficiently due to its high effective inertia, the latter
fulfills all the conditions for efficient collimation by the
magneto-centrifugal mechanism. Given the right balance between the effective
inertia of the inner flow and the collimation efficiency of the outer disk
wind, the relativistic flow is magnetically confined into a well collimated

orders of magnitude in spatial extent. The synthetic synchrotron maps reproduce
the morphological structure of the jet of M87, i.e. center-bright profiles near
the core and limb-bright profiles away from the core. At the same time, they
also show a local increase of brightness at some distance along the axis
associated to a recollimation shock in the MHD model. Its location coincides
with the position of the optical knot HST-1. In addition our best fitting model
is consistent with a number of observational constraints such as the magnetic

electron and ion fluctuation scales in a five-dimensional phase space and time.
Simultaneously, one must account for the interaction of this turbulence with
the slow evolution of the large-scale plasma profiles. Because of the enormous
range of scales involved and the high dimensionality of the problem, resolved
first-principles global simulations are very challenging using conventional
(brute force) techniques. In this thesis, the problem of resolving turbulence
is addressed by developing velocity space resolution diagnostics and an
adaptive collisionality that allow for the confident simulation of velocity
space dynamics using the approximate minimal necessary dissipation. With regard
to the wide range of scales, a new approach has been developed in which
turbulence calculations from multiple gyrokinetic flux tube simulations are
coupled together using transport equations to obtain self-consistent,
steady-state background profiles and corresponding turbulent fluxes and
heating. This approach is embodied in a new code, Trinity, which is capable of
evolving equilibrium profiles for multiple species, including electromagnetic
effects and realistic magnetic geometry, at a fraction of the cost of
conventional global simulations. Furthermore, an advanced model physical
collision operator for gyrokinetics has been derived and implemented, allowing
for the study of collisional turbulent heating, which has not been extensively
studied. To demonstrate the utility of the coupled flux tube approach,
