  Galaxies at small lookback time and dependence on the environment","18 pages, 22 figures.

galaxies of similar L, whether these other objects are in the field, or are
satellites in clusters (Re ~ L for BCGs). At fixed M* and formation time, BCGs
at lower z are larger and have smaller velocity dispersions, i.e. Re increases
and sigma decreases with age. As a result, at z~0.25, corresponding to a
lookback time of order 3 Gyrs, BCGs are smaller than their lower z counterparts
by as much as 70% for the brightest BCGs: Re evolves as (1+z)^{0.85(Mr+21)}.
Qualitatively similar but weaker evolution in the sizes is also seen in the
bulk of the early-type population: at Mr<-22 Re evolves as (1+z)^{0.7(Mr+21)},
while at Mr>-22 the evolution is approximately (1+z)^{-0.7}, independent of Mr.
The sigma-L correlation also evolves: (1+z)^{-0.2(Mr+21)} at Mr < -22 (as for
the BCGs) and (1+z)^{0.2} for fainter galaxies. The Re- and sigma-M*
correlations yield consistent results. These trends are most easily understood
if early-type BCGs grew from many dry minor mergers rather than a few major
mergers. Only in such a scenario can BCGs be the descendents of the superdense
galaxies seen at z~2; major dry mergers, which increase the size in proportion
to the mass, cannot bring these galaxies onto the BCG Re-M* relation at z~0. We
also compared the ages and sizes of our early-type BCGs with satellites. BCGs
are larger than satellites of similar L or M* at the same redshift. Although
both satellites and BCGs trace the same weak age-L or age-M* relation, this can
be understood by noting that BCGs are typically about 1 Gyr older than the
satellites in their group, and they are about 0.5 mags more luminous. Finally,
we find that the mean satellite L is approximately independent of BCG L, in
agreement with recent predictions based on the L-dependence of clustering.

greater applicability and can very well be used to describe the rapidity
spectra of protons and antiprotons separately measured at the highest energy of
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider i.e., 200 GeV/A by BRAHMS Collaboration. We
have also determined that the contribution of the decay products of the heavier
resonances like delta, lambda etc. actually dominate over the protons
(antiprotons) of pure thermal origin. We have also imposed the criteria of
exact strangeness conservation in each fireball separately. It is shown that it
is possible to explain not only the p-pbar data but the complete set of data
viz. the rapidity distributions of protons, antiprotons and the ratio pbar/p
simultaneously quite well with a single set of model parameters which includes
a single value of the temperature parameter T chosen for all the fireballs. We
have also fitted the Kaon rapidity spectra obtained by BRAHMS collaboration in
the same experiment. This is unlike the previous analyses wherein a varying
temperature has been assumed for the fireballs formed along the rapidity axis.
The chemical potentials are however assumed to be dependent on the fireball

  Intense Energy Fluxes with Matter (accepted)",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the fcc lattice of Pd, hydrogen occupies octahedral interstitial positions
with cubic symmetry. One could therefore expect that in dilute solid H
solutions in Pd the fundamental band of optical H vibrations should be reduced
to a narrow line of 3-fold degenerate, non-interacting isotropic local
oscillators. A few attempts to test this assumption by inelastic neutron
scattering gave ambiguous results due to the very small limiting hydrogen
concentration, x<0.001, of the PdH$_x$ solutions at low temperatures. We
increased maximum x by alloying Pd with 20 at% Au and studied disordered
Pd$_{0.8}$Au$_{0.2}$H$_{x}$ solutions with concentrations varying from x = 0.03
to 0.74. According to reported $^{197}$Au Mossbauer studies, hydrogen atoms in
the Pd$_{0.8}$Au$_{0.2}$H$_{x}$ solutions with x < (0.8)^{6} = 0.26 can only
occupy interstices having no Au neighbours. This abates the effect of H-Au
interactions in the solutions with lower H concentrations and effectively
prevents hydrogen clustering at low temperatures. Our INS investigation showed
that the fundamental optical H band in both concentrated and dilute
Pd$_{0.8}$Au$_{0.2}$H$_{x}$ solutions consists of a sharp peak with a broad
shoulder towards higher energies. The shoulder shows no tendency to vanish with
decreasing H concentration and amounts to approximately 0.44 integral intensity
of the main peak in all studied samples. The optical band in infinitely diluted
H solutions in Pd should therefore consist of a peak with a pronounced shoulder
too. Implications for the isotopic effects in the hydrogen solubility in Pd are
considered in the present paper.

obtained by a statistical subtraction of the decay photon pairs from inclusive

the measured $\pi^0$-hadron by means of a Monte Carlo based calculation which
takes into account decay kinematics and detector response. Under the assumption
that the suppression is nearly pt independent using a specific averaging
scheme, we find an average ratio of Au+Au to p+p per-trigger photon yields,
$I_{AA}$, consistent with the single particle suppression level Raa, which can
be interpreted as a qualitative confirmation of the basic geometrical picture
of jet suppression at RHIC. The application of the event by event photon
isolation cuts in $p+p$ results our highest precision measurement yet, and
allows for precision studies of the baseline fragmentation function $D(z)$, and
well as a variable \pout which is proportional to the apparent intrinsic $k_T$,
or non-zero transverse momentum of the original collision partons. With a model
dependent extraction method, the average $sqrt(<k_T^2>)$ at this center of mass
energy in p+p is found to be in the vicinity of 3 GeV, consistent with analysis
of di-hadron (di-jet) correlations. This and the improved precision in the
isolated yields warrant further comparison with the baseline perturbative QCD

determined from high energy resolution Chandra observations, show that the
highest temperatures occur near the star, and then steadily decrease outward
through the wind. To explain this unexpected behavior, we propose a shock model
concept that utilizes a well-known magnetic propulsion mechanism; the surface
ejection of ""diamagnetic plasmoids"" into a diverging external magnetic field.
This produces rapidly accelerating self-contained structures that plow through
an ambient wind and form bow shocks that generate a range in X-ray temperatures
determined by the plasmoid-wind relative velocities. The model free parameters
are the plasmoid initial Alfven speed, the initial plasma-beta of the external
medium, and the divergence rate of the external field. These are determined by
fitting the predicted bow shock temperatures with the observed OB supergiant
X-ray temperature distribution. We find that the initial external plasma-beta
has a range between 0 and 2, and the assumed radially-decreasing external
magnetic field strength that scales as r^{-S} has a value of S lying between 2
and 3. Most importantly, the initial plasmoid Alfven speed is found to be
well-constrained at a value of 0.6 times the terminal velocity, which appears
to represent an upper limit for all normal OB stars. This intriguing new limit
on OB magnetic properties, as derived from Chandra observations, emphasizes the
need for further studies of magnetic propulsion mechanisms in these stars.

the design of wireless systems such as future generation cellular networks.
This paper studies receiver design for a wireless channel model with both
time-varying Rayleigh fading and strong co-channel interference of similar form
as the desired signal. It is assumed that the channel coefficients of the
desired signal can be estimated through the use of pilots, whereas no pilot for
the interference signal is available, as is the case in many practical wireless
systems. Because the interference process is non-Gaussian, treating it as
Gaussian noise generally often leads to unacceptable performance. In order to
exploit the statistics of the interference and correlated fading in time, an
iterative message-passing architecture is proposed for joint channel
estimation, interference mitigation and decoding. Each message takes the form
of a mixture of Gaussian densities where the number of components is limited so
that the overall complexity of the receiver is constant per symbol regardless
of the frame and code lengths. Simulation of both coded and uncoded systems
shows that the receiver performs significantly better than conventional
receivers with linear channel estimation, and is robust with respect to
mismatch in the assumed fading model.

determining and solving the Anderson model. When an electron reservoir is
explicitly considered, it is proved that the single-site self-energy is that of
a normal Fermi liquid even if the multisite self-energy is anomalous. Thus, the
ground state is a normal Fermi liquid in the supreme single-site approximation
(S^3A). In the strong-coupling regime, the Fermi liquid is stabilized by the
Kondo effect in the S^3A and is further stabilized by the Fock-type term of the
superexchange interaction or the resonating-valence-bond (RVB) mechanism beyond
the S^3A. The stabilized Fermi liquid is frustrated as much as an RVB spin
liquid in the Heisenberg model. It is a relevant unperturbed state that can be

Kandrup on nonequilibrium statistical mechanics in the framework of special
relativity. This is the first one devoted to the general mathematical
structure. Basing on the action-at-a-distance formalism we obtain a single-time
Liouville equation. This equation describes the manifestly covariant evolution
of the distribution function of full classical many-body systems. For such
global evolution the Bogoliubov functional assumption is justified. In
particular, using the Balescu-Wallenborn projection operator approach we find
that the distribution function of full many-body systems is completely
determined by the reduced one-body distribution function. A manifestly
covariant closed nonlinear equation satisfied by the reduced one-body
distribution function is rigorously derived. We also discuss extensively the
generalization to the general relativity especially an application to
self-gravitating systems.

rays (UHECR) interacting with CMB photons (cosmogenic neutrinos) and by
top-down sources, such as topological defects (TD), superheavy dark matter
(SHDM) and mirror matter. Cosmogenic neutrinos are reliably predicted and their
fluxes can be numerically evaluated using the observed flux of UHECR. The lower
limit for the flux is obtained for the case of pure proton composition of the
observed UHECR. The rigorous upper limit for cosmogenic neutrino flux also
exists. The maximum neutrino energy is determined by maximum energy of
acceleration, which at least for the shock acceleration is expected not to
exceed $10^{21} - 10^{22}$ eV. The top-down sources provide neutrino energies a
few orders of magnitude higher, and this can be considered as a signature of
these models. Oscillations play important role in UHE neutrino astronomy. At
production of cosmogenic neutrinos $\tau$-neutrinos are absent and
$\bar{\nu}_e$ neutrinos are suppressed. These species, important for detection,
appear in the observed fluxes due to oscillation. Mirror neutrinos cannot be
observed directly, but due to oscillations to ordinary neutrinos they can
provide the largest neutrino flux at the highest energies.

phase-referencing, pulsar gating, calibration, and data reduction. The use of
the bootstrap method to estimate astrometric uncertainties in the presence of
unmodeled systematic errors is also described. Based on our new
model-independent estimates for distance and transverse velocity, we
investigate the kinematics and birth sites of the pulsars and revisit models of
the Galactic electron density distribution. We find that young pulsars are
moving away from the Galactic plane, as expected, and that age estimates from
kinematics and pulsar spindown are generally in agreement, with certain notable
exceptions. Given its present trajectory, the pulsar B2045-16 was plausibly
born in the open cluster NGC 6604. For several high-latitude pulsars, the
NE2001 electron density model underestimates the parallax distances by a factor
of two, while in others the estimates agree with or are larger than the
parallax distances, suggesting that the interstellar medium is irregular on
relevant length scales. The VLBA astrometric results for the recycled pulsar

Line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies. NLS1 galaxies differ from BLS1 with respect to

the natural expectation is the need to use a different scaling coefficient
between the mass and the variance in these two types of sources. However, we

NLS1 galaxies in our sample a single scaling coefficient (larger by a factor
20) provided us with a satisfactory method of mass determination, in a small
subset of NLS1 galaxies this approach failed. Variability of those objects
appeared to be at the intermediate level between NLS1 and BLS1 galaxies. These
exceptional NLS1 galaxies have much harder soft X-ray spectra than majority of
NLS1 galaxies. We thus postulate that the division of Seyfert 1 galaxies into

Hence, the effects of thermal prestress are important research subjects in view

prestress, geometrically non-linear behaviour, as well as damping and its
coupling with the aforementioned phenomena has to be taken into account for a
comprehensive understanding of the structural behaviour. Since the literature
on this subject lacks a clear procedure to derive models of thin prestressed
and damped structures from 3D continuum mechanics, this paper presents a new
derivation of models for thin structures accounting for generic prestress,
moderate rotations and viscous damping. Although inspired by classical
approaches, the proposed procedure is quite different, because of (i) the
definition of a modified Hu-Washizu (H-W) functional, accounting for stress
constraints associated with Lagrange multipliers, in order to derive
lower-dimensional models in a convenient way; (ii) an original definition of a
(mechanical and thermal) strain measure and a rotation measure enabling one to
identify the main terms in the strain energy and to derive a cascade of
lower-dimensional models (iii) a new definition of ""strain-rotation domains""
providing a clear interpretation of the classical assumptions of ""small
perturbations"" and ""small strains and moderate rotations""; (iv) the
introduction of a pseudo-potential with stress constraints to account for

behavior of materials to be represented by introducing the notion of intrinsic
time. With different viewpoints, several authors discussed the relationship
between this theory and the classical theory of plasticity. Two major
differences are the presence of plastic strains during unloading phases and the
absence of an elastic domain. Later, the endochronic plasticity theory was
modified in order to introduce the effect of damage. In the present paper, a
basic endochronic model with isotropic damage is formulated starting from the
postulate of strain equivalence. Unlike the previous similar analyses, in this
presentation the formal tools chosen to formulate the model are those of convex
analysis, often used in classical plasticity: namely pseudopotentials,
indicator functions, subdifferentials, etc. As a result, the notion of loading
surface for an endochronic model of plasticity with damage is investigated and
an insightful comparison with classical models is made possible. A damage
pseudopotential definition allowing a very general damage evolution is given.

strength and stiffness degradation is provided. It is based on the relationship
between the flow rules of these models and those of the endochronic plasticity
theory with damage, discussed in a companion paper (Erlicher and Point, 2008).
Using the theoretical framework of that extended endochronic theory, it is
shown that an elastic Bouc-Wen model with damage, i.e. without plastic strains,
can be formulated. Moreover, a proper definition of the dissipated energy of
these Bouc-Wen models with degradation is given and some thermodynamic
constraints on the parameters defining the models behavior are emphasized and
discussed. In particular, some properties of the energetic linear stiffness
degradation rule as well as the so-called pivot rule, well-known in the seismic
engineering field, are illustrated and commented upon. An improved energetic
stiffness degradation rule and a new stiffness degradation rule are proposed.

  Journal of Knot Theory and its Ramifications",,,,"math.GT math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Let $D$ be an oriented classical or virtual link diagram with directed
universe $\vec{U}$. Let $C$ denote a set of directed Euler circuits, one in
each connected component of $U$. There is then an associated looped
interlacement graph $L(D,C)$ whose construction involves very little geometric
information about the way $D$ is drawn in the plane; consequently $L(D,C)$ is
different from other combinatorial structures associated with classical link
diagrams, like the checkerboard graph, which can be difficult to extend to
arbitrary virtual links. $L(D,C)$ is determined by three things: the structure
of $\vec{U}$ as a 2-in, 2-out digraph, the distinction between crossings that
make a positive contribution to the writhe and those that make a negative
contribution, and the relationship between $C$ and the directed circuits in
$\vec{U}$ arising from the link components; this relationship is indicated by
marking the vertices where $C$ does not follow the incident link component(s).
We introduce a bracket polynomial for arbitrary marked graphs, defined using
either a formula involving matrix nullities or a recursion involving the local
complement and pivot operations; the marked-graph bracket of $L(D,C)$ is the
same as the Kauffman bracket of $D$. This provides a unified combinatorial
description of the Jones polynomial that applies seamlessly to both classical
and non-classical virtual links.
