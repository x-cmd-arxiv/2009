Necessary conditions for consistency include the prior putting enough weight on

sufficient conditions further restrict the prior in ways analogous to capacity
control in frequentist nonparametrics. The asymptotics of Bayesian updating
with mis-specified models or priors, or non-Markovian data, are far less well
explored. Here I establish sufficient conditions for posterior convergence when
all hypotheses are wrong, and the data have complex dependencies. The main

convergence, lets me build a sieve-like structure for the prior. The main
statistical assumption, also a form of capacity control, concerns the
compatibility of the prior and the data-generating process, controlling the
fluctuations in the log-likelihood when averaged over the sieve-like sets. In
addition to posterior convergence, I derive a kind of large deviations
principle for the posterior measure, extending in some cases to rates of
convergence, and discuss the advantages of predicting using a combination of
models known to be wrong. An appendix sketches connections between these

For heavy baryons, we include production from coalescence of heavy quarks with

the strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma produced in these collisions. Including
the contribution from decays of heavy hadron resonances and also that due to
fragmentation of heavy quarks that are left in the system after coalescence,
the resulting $\Lambda_c/D^0$ and $\Lambda_b/\bar{B}^0$ ratios in midrapidity
($|y|\le 0.5$) from central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV are
about a factor of five and ten, respectively, larger than those given by the
thermal model, and about a factor of ten and twelve, respectively, larger than
corresponding ratios in the PYTHIA model for $pp$ collisions. These ratios are
reduced by a factor of about 1.6 if there are no diquarks in the quark-gluon

found to be sensitive to the heavy quark mass, with the $\Lambda_b/\bar{B}^0$

the transverse momentum $p_T^{} \simeq 0.8$ GeV but the peak shifts to $p_T^{}

non-trivial task to construct physically meaningful states on the algebra. For
instance, we are in the unsatisfactory situation that there exist no examples
of states suited to describe local thermal equilibrium in a non-stationary
spacetime. In this thesis, we construct a class of states for the Klein-Gordon
field in Robertson-Walker spacetimes, which seem to provide the first example
of thermal states in a spacetime without time translation symmetry. More
precisely, in the setting of real, linear, scalar fields in Robertson-Walker
spacetimes we define on the set of homogeneous, isotropic, quasi-free states a
free energy functional that is based on the averaged energy density measured by
an isotropic observer along his worldline. This functional is well defined and
lower bounded by a suitable quantum energy inequality. Subsequently, we
minimize this functional and obtain states that we interpret as 'almost
equilibrium states'. It turns out that the states of low energy, which were
recently introduced by Olbermann, are the ground states of the almost
equilibrium states. Finally, we prove that the almost equilibrium states
satisfy the Hadamard condition, which qualifies them as physically meaningful
states.

has been a subject of interest since the inception of quantum mechanics.
Prerequisite to this regime are both preparation of the mechanical oscillator
at low phonon occupancy and a measurement sensitivity at the scale of the
spread of the oscillator's ground state wavefunction. It has been widely
perceived that the most promising approach to address these two challenges are
electro nanomechanical systems. Here we approach for the first time the quantum
regime with a mechanical oscillator of mesoscopic dimensions--discernible to
the bare eye--and 1000-times more massive than the heaviest nano-mechanical
oscillators used to date. Imperative to these advances are two key principles
of cavity optomechanics: Optical interferometric measurement of mechanical
displacement at the attometer level, and the ability to use measurement induced
dynamic back-action to achieve resolved sideband laser cooling of the
mechanical degree of freedom. Using only modest cryogenic pre-cooling to 1.65
K, preparation of a mechanical oscillator close to its quantum ground state
(63+-20 phonons) is demonstrated. Simultaneously, a readout sensitivity that is
within a factor of 5.5+-1.5 of the standard quantum limit is achieved. The
reported experiments mark a paradigm shift in the approach to the quantum limit
of mechanical oscillators using optical techniques and represent a first step
into a new era of experimental investigation which probes the quantum nature of
the most tangible harmonic oscillator: a mechanical vibration.

fields of precipitation, precipitation frequency, and near surface air
temperature, simulated by the Eta model, were compared with the observational
data of the CRU and GPCP projects. This comparison shows that the Eta model
reproduces well the main patterns of the summer and winter observed
precipitation fields over South America. But the magnitude of precipitation is
underestimated by the ETA CCS model in the regions of strong convection
activity in summer. This underestimation of observed precipitation is larger
for the Eta model driven by HadAM3P than by the reanalysis. The observed number
of wet days is overestimated by HadAM3P. The number of wet days in both runs of
the Eta model is closer to observations. The main summer and winter patterns of
near surface air temperature are reproduced well by both HadAM3P and the Eta
model. The Eta model overestimates the observed surface temperature over the
central part of the continent due to the lack of convective cloudiness in this

selected regions over South America. On the whole, these results support the

norm of the potential part of the fluxes of solutions, which is equivalent to
the usual $H^1$-norm. We show that in the flux norm, the error associated with
approximating, in a properly defined finite-dimensional space, the set of
solutions of the aforementioned PDEs with rough coefficients is equal to the
error associated with approximating the set of solutions of the same type of
PDEs with smooth coefficients in a standard space (e.g., piecewise polynomial).
We refer to this property as the {\it transfer property}.
  A simple application of this property is the construction of finite
dimensional approximation spaces with errors independent of the regularity and
contrast of the coefficients and with optimal and explicit convergence rates.
This transfer property also provides an alternative to the global harmonic
change of coordinates for the homogenization of elliptic operators that can be
extended to elasticity equations. The proofs of these homogenization results
are based on a new class of elliptic inequalities which play the same role in
our approach as the div-curl lemma in classical homogenization.

genes, their function and amino acid composition. Results of Monte Carlo
simulations of evolution of protein coding sequences have shown a specific role
of genetic code in minimizing the effect of nucleotide substitutions on the
amino acid composition of proteins. The results of simulations were compared
with the results of analyses of genomic and proteomic data bases. This chapter
is considered as an introduction to further chapters where chromosomes with
genes represented by nucleotide sequences were replaced by bitstrings with
single bits representing genes.

infinity. The function $f$ is said to be of generalised regular variation if
there exist functions $h \not\equiv 0$ and $g > 0$ such that $f(xt) - f(t) =
h(x) g(t) + o(g(t))$ as $t \to \infty$ for all $x \in (0, \infty)$. Zooming in
on the remainder term $o(g(t))$ leads eventually to a relation of the form
$f(xt) - f(t) = h_1(x) g_1(t) + ... + h_n(x) g_n(t) + o(g_n(t))$, each $g_i$
being of smaller order than its predecessor $g_{i-1}$. The function $f$ is said
to be generalised regularly varying of order $n$ with rate vector $\g = (g_1,
>..., g_n)'$. Under general assumptions, $\g$ itself must be regularly varying
in the sense that $\g(xt) = x^{\B} \g(t) + o(g_n(t))$ for some upper triangular
matrix $\B \in \RR^{n \times n}$, and the vector of limit functions $\h = (h_1,

vector $\c \in \RR^{1 \times n}$. The usual results in the theory of regular
variation such as uniform convergence and Potter bounds continue to hold. An
interesting special case arises when all the rate functions $g_i$ are slowly
varying, yielding $\Pi$-variation of order $n$, the canonical case being that
$\B$ is equivalent to a single Jordan block with zero diagonal. The theory is
applied to a long list of special functions.

source to a single destination. The reliability of this transmission may suffer
from bursty packet losses - the predominant type of failures in today's
Internet. An effective and well studied solution to this problem is to protect
the data by a Forward Error Correction (FEC) code and send the FEC packets over
multiple paths.
  In this paper we show that the performance of such a multipath FEC scheme can
often be further improved. Our key observation is that the propagation times on
the available paths often significantly differ, typically by 10-100ms.
  We propose to exploit these differences by appropriate packet scheduling that
we call `Spread'. We evaluate our solution with a precise, analytical
formulation and trace-driven simulations. Our studies show that Spread
substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions. It typically achieves
two- to five-fold improvement (reduction) in the effective loss rate. Or
conversely, keeping the same level of effective loss rate, Spread significantly
decreases the observed delays and helps fighting the delay jitter.

location or physical conditions of the GC lobe. This paper describes the
analysis of new and archival single-dish observations of radio recombination
lines toward this enigmatic object. The observations find that the ionized gas
has a morphology similar to the radio continuum emission, suggesting that they
are associated. We study averages of several transitions from H106alpha to
H191epsilon and find that the line ratios are most consistent with gas in local
thermodynamic equilibrium. The radio recombination line widths are remarkably
narrow, constraining the typical electron temperature to be less than about
4000 K. These observations also find evidence of pressure broadening in the
higher electronic states, implying a gas density of n_e=910^{+310}_{-450}

consistent with the idea that the GC lobe is located in the GC region. If so,
the ionized gas appears to form a shell surrounding the central 100 parsecs of

electron gas on the surface of a cylinder. The novel topology leads to a
spatially varying filling factor along the current path. The resulting
inhomogeneous current-density distribution gives rise to additional features in
the magneto-transport, such as resistance asymmetry and modified longitudinal
resistances. We experimentally demonstrate that the asymmetry relations
satisfied in the integer filling factor regime are valid also in the transition
regime to non-integer filling factors, thereby suggesting a more general form
of these asymmetry relations. A model is developed based on the screening
theory of the integer quantum Hall effect that allows the self-consistent
calculation of the local electron density and thereby the local current density
including the current along incompressible stripes. The model, which also
includes the so-called `static skin effect' to account for the current density
distribution in the compressible regions, is capable of explaining the main
experimental observations. Due to the existence of an
incompressible-compressible transition in the bulk, the system behaves always
metal-like in contrast to the conventional Landauer-Buettiker description, in
which the bulk remains completely insulating throughout the quantized Hall
plateau regime.

calibrated. For TiCoSb, NbNiSn, FeMoSb the stability of Half-Heusler phase
against concurrent crystal structures like TiNiSi, ZrCoAl, ZrBeSi, FeSiV, ZrNiP

calculated from the difference in lattice energies is less than 0.1eV/atom.
Hence, the fabrication of Half Heusler phases is a challenge and requires three
steps, surface activation of the raw material by ball milling, arc-melting of
pressed pellets and finally long-term annealing treatment in a vacuum furnace.
On doped TiCoSb specimens, Seebeck coefficients up to 0.1 mV/K, on NiNbSn 0.16
mV/K were measured, although the microstructure was not yet optimized.

to obtain a sparse solution to the generalized eigenvalue problem. We achieve
this by constraining the cardinality of the solution to the generalized
eigenvalue problem and obtain sparse principal component analysis (PCA), sparse
canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and sparse Fisher discriminant analysis
(FDA) as special cases. Unlike the $\ell_1$-norm approximation to the
cardinality constraint, which previous methods have used in the context of
sparse PCA, we propose a tighter approximation that is related to the negative
log-likelihood of a Student's t-distribution. The problem is then framed as a
d.c. (difference of convex functions) program and is solved as a sequence of
convex programs by invoking the majorization-minimization method. The resulting
algorithm is proved to exhibit \emph{global convergence} behavior, i.e., for
any random initialization, the sequence (subsequence) of iterates generated by
the algorithm converges to a stationary point of the d.c. program. The
performance of the algorithm is empirically demonstrated on both sparse PCA
(finding few relevant genes that explain as much variance as possible in a
high-dimensional gene dataset) and sparse CCA (cross-language document

strongly suppressed in the hadronic free region between the chiral restoration

potential role played by the holographic dimension intrinsic in gravity-gauge
duality that provides a unified field theory description of hadrons -- both
mesons and baryons -- under extreme conditions. Baryons arise as coherent
states of pions and vector mesons of holographic QCD which define the ground
state or the ""vacuum"" on which mesonic excitations could undergo BR scaling.

luminosities are not correlated. Complementing the infrared photometry with
GALEX-UV data, we estimate the source bolometric luminosities. For a given
stellar IMF we simulate a theoretical curve for the expected
bolometric-to-Halpha luminosity ratio, along which stellar clusters are born.
We call this the cluster birthline in the Lbol--Lbol/LHal plane. The birthline
is flat for Lbol>3x10^{39}erg/s because all clusters fully sample the IMF and
it increases toward lower luminosities as the upper end of the IMF becomes
incompletely sampled. The observations of M33 show that young isolated clusters
lie close to the theoretical birthline for a wide range of Lbol. The luminosity
is not proportional to Halpha emission for low mass clusters and aging moves
clusters above the birthline. The best fit to the birthline is for a randomly
sampled IMF, in which the mass of most massive star in a cluster is not
strictly limited by the cluster's mass. We also find that the IR luminosity of
young stellar clusters in M33 is not proportional to their bolometric
luminosity. This irregularity could be the result of low and patchy dust
abundance in M33.

respect to the $z-$axis is studied using a path integral approach. It is shown
that it is possible to reduce this problem to a two-dimensional case, in a way
which is similar to the reduction of the statistical mechanics of a directed
polymer to the random walk of a two-dimensional particle.

degeneracies of low-energy excited states for the bimodal Ising spin glass on
the brickwork lattice. Since the distributions are extreme and do not
self-average, we base our conclusions on the most likely values of the
degeneracies. Our main result is that the degeneracy of the first excited state
per ground state and per spin is finite in the thermodynamic limit. This is
very different from the same model on a square lattice where a divergence
proportional to the linear lattice size is expected. The energy gap for the
brickwork lattice is obviously 2J on finite systems and predicted to be the
same in the thermodynamic limit. Our results suggest that a 2J gap is universal
for planar bimodal Ising spin glasses. The distribution of the second
contribution to the internal energy has a mode close to zero and we predict
that the low-temperature specific heat is dominated by the leading term
proportional to $T^{-2} \exp(-2J/kT)$.

(reaching ~3 mJy at 70 um) obtained with Spitzer in the GOODS and FIDEL fields
to derive the evolution of the rest-frame 15 um, 35 um, and total infrared
luminosity functions of galaxies spanning z < 1.3. In comparison with previous
studies, the present one takes advantage of deep 70 um observations that
provide a more robust infrared luminosity indicator than 24 um affected by the
emission of PAHs at high redshift (z~1), and we use several independent fields
to control cosmic variance. We use a new extraction technique based on the
well-determined positions of galaxies at shorter wavelengths to extract the 24
and 70 um flux densities of galaxies. Using a combination of photometric and
spectroscopic redshifts that exist for ~80% of the sources in our sample, we
are able to estimate the rest-frame luminosities of galaxies at 15um and 35um.
Then using a careful stacking analysis to validate the infrared bolometric
corrections we compute the infrared luminosity function in three redshift bins
z~0.55, z~0.85, and z~1.15. We find that the average infrared spectral energy
distribution of galaxies over the last 2/3 of the cosmic time is consistent
with that of local galaxies, although individual sources do present significant
scatter. We also measured both the bright and faint ends of the infrared
luminosity functions and find no evidence for a change in the slope of the
double power law used to characterize the luminosity function. The redshift
evolution of infrared luminous galaxies is consistent with pure luminosity
evolution proportional to (1+z)^3.6 up to z~1.3. The comoving number density of
infrared luminous galaxies has increased by a factor of ~100 between 0< z <1.
By z~1.0, LIRGs produce half of the total comoving infrared luminosity density.

computational biology is almost always a compromise between mathematical theory

progresses, computational power increases but well-established inference
methods often remain locked in their initial suboptimal solution. We revisit
the approach of Segal et al. (2003) to infer regulatory modules and their
condition-specific regulators from gene expression data. In contrast to their
direct optimization-based solution we use a more representative centroid-like
solution extracted from an ensemble of possible statistical models to explain
the data. The ensemble method automatically selects a subset of most
informative genes and builds a quantitatively better model for them. Genes
which cluster together in the majority of models produce functionally more
coherent modules. Regulators which are consistently assigned to a module are
more often supported by literature, but a single model always contains many
regulator assignments not supported by the ensemble. Reliably detecting
condition-specific or combinatorial regulation is particularly hard in a single
optimum but can be achieved using ensemble averaging.

observed EPs, focusing on the origin of the HPs. Among the several HP formation
mechanisms proposed so far, the two main formation mechanisms are type II
migration and scattering. In both cases, planets form beyond the so-called
snow-line of the protoplanetary disk and then migrate inward due to angular
momentum and energy exchange with either the protoplanetary disk or with
companion planets. Although theoretical studies produce a range of observed
features, no firm correspondence between the observed EPs and models has yet
been established. In our analysis, by means of principal component analysis and
hierarchical cluster analysis, we find convincing indications for the existence
of two types of HPs, whose parameters reflect physical mechanisms of type II
migration and scattering.

black hole implies that very different processes originating from the
gravitational collapse a) of a single star in a binary system induced by the
companion, or b) of two neutron stars, or c) of a neutron star and a white
dwarf, do lead to the same structure for the observed GRB. The recent progress
of the numerical integration of the relativistic Boltzmann equations with
collision integrals including 2-body and 3-body interactions between the
particles offer a powerful conceptual tool in order to differentiate the
traditional ""fireball"" picture, an expanding hot cavity considered by Cavallo
and Rees, as opposed to the ""fireshell"" model, composed of an internally cold
shell of relativistically expanding electron-positron-baryon plasma. The
analysis of the fireshell naturally leads to a canonical GRB composed of a

paradigms for GRBs we show how the fireshell model leads to an understanding of

layer and carbon nanotubes, using a tight-binding model and the continuum
theory based on Dirac fermion fields. The latter provides a unified description
of different lattice structures with curvature, which is always localized at
six heptagonal carbon rings around each junction. When these are evenly spaced,
we find that it is possible to curve the planar lattice into armchair (6n,6n)
as well as zig-zag (6n,0) nanotubes. We show that the junctions fall into two
different classes, regarding the low-energy electronic behavior. One of them,
constituted by the junctions made of the armchair nanotubes and the zig-zag
(6n,0) geometries when n is a multiple of 3, is characterized by the presence
of two quasi-bound states at the Fermi level, which are absent for the rest of
the zig-zag nanotubes. These states, localized at the junction, are shown to
arise from the effective gauge flux induced by the heptagonal carbon rings,
which has a direct reflection in the local density of states around the
junction. Furthermore, we also analyze the band structure of the arrays of
junctions, finding out that they can also be classified into two different
groups according to the low-energy behavior. In this regard, the arrays made of
armchair and (6n,0) nanotubes with n equal to a multiple of 3 are characterized
by the presence of a series of flat bands, whose number grows with the length
of the nanotubes. We show that such flat bands have their origin in the
formation of states confined to the nanotubes in the array. This is explained
in the continuum theory from the possibility of forming standing waves in the
mentioned nanotube geometries, as a superposition of modes with opposite
momenta and the same quantum numbers under the C_6v symmetry of the junction.

The peak in the conductance of the FIS contact at the zero potential for the

that the source was approximately 1 mag brighter than in 2003-2006 due to an
on-going X-ray flare that started in March 2007. The increased source
brightness enabled us to detect optical pulsations with an identical period
(6.458 s) to the X-ray pulsations. The rms pulsed fraction in our data is
21+/-7%, approximately the same as the 2-10 keV X-ray rms pulsed fraction. The
optical and X-ray pulse profiles show similar morphologies and appear to be
approximately in phase with each other, the latter lagging the former by only
0.06+/-0.02 cycles. The optical pulsations in 1E 1048.1-5937 are very similar

any graph of average degree greater than $d$ and, based upon it, we tackle MIS
in graphs of average degree 4, 5 and 6.

properties of magnetic fluctuations are investigated in the Venusian

scaling features of fluctuations along Venus Express (VEX) trajectory and to
understand the specific circumstances of the occurrence of different types of
scalings. For the latter task we also use the results of measurements from the
previous missions to Venus. Our main result is that the changing character of
physical interactions between the solar wind and the planetary obstacle is
leading to different types of spectral scaling in the near-Venusian space.
Noisy fluctuations are observed in the magnetosheath, wavy structures near the
terminator and in the nightside near-planet wake. Multi-scale turbulence is
observed at the magnetosheath boundary layer and near the quasi-parallel bow
shock. Magnetosheath boundary layer turbulence is associated with an average
magnetic field which is nearly aligned with the Sun-Venus line. Noisy magnetic
fluctuations are well described with the Gaussian statistics. Both
magnetosheath boundary layer and near shock turbulence statistics exhibit
non-Gaussian features and intermittency over small spatio-temporal scales. The
occurrence of turbulence near magnetosheath boundaries can be responsible for
the local heating of plasma observed by previous missions.

different species that are often observed in birds, primates and cetaceans.
They have been interpreted as a strategy to reduce predation risk, enhance
foraging success and/or provide a social advantage. In the archipelago of the
Azores, four species of dolphins are commonly involved in mixed-species
associations: the common dolphin, Delphinus delphis, the bottlenose dolphin,
Tursiops truncatus, the striped dolphin, Stenella coeruleoalba, and the spotted
dolphin, Stenella frontalis. In order to understand the reasons why dolphins
associate, we analysed field data collected since 1999 by research scientists
and trained observers placed onboard fishing vessels. In total, 113
mixed-species groups were observed out of 5720 sightings. The temporal
distribution, habitat (water depth, distance to the coast), behaviour (i.e.
feeding, travelling, socializing), size and composition of mixed-species groups
were compared with those of single-species groups. Results did not support the
predation avoidance hypothesis and gave little support to the social advantage
hypothesis. The foraging advantage hypothesis was the most convincing. However,
the benefits of mixed-species associations appeared to depend on the species.
Associations were likely to be opportunistic in the larger bottlenose dolphin,
while there seemed to be some evolutionary constraints favouring associations
in the rarer striped dolphin. Comparison with previous studies suggests that
the formation of mixed-species groups depends on several environmental factors,
and therefore may constitute an adaptive response.

The random thermal fluctuations are delineated from random noise at sub-shot
noise levels. The principle behind this extraction, which is quite general and
is not limited to surface measurements, is explained. An optical lever is used
to measure the spectrum of fluctuations in the inclinations of surfaces down to
$\sim 10^{-17}\rm rad^2/Hz$ at $1\sim10 \mu$W optical intensity, corresponding
to $\sim 10^{-29} \rm m^2/\rm Hz$ in the vertical displacement, in the
frequency range $1{\rm}\rm kHz\sim10 MHz$. The dynamical evolution of the
surface properties is also investigated. The measurement requires only a short
amount of time and is essentially passive, so that it can be applied to a wide
variety of surfaces.

companion galaxy to study the H2/HI transition, the gas-to-dust ratios, and the
stability of the disk against gravitational collapse. We combine maps of the
molecular gas using 12CO 2--1 map HERA/IRAM-30m data and HI VLA data to study
the total gas surface density and the phase transition of atomic to molecular
gas. The total gas surface density is compared to the dust surface density from
850 micron SCUBA data. Taking into account the velocity dispersions of the
molecular and atomic gas, and the stellar surface densities derived from the
2MASS K-band survey, we derive the total Toomre Q parameter of the disk. The
gas surface density in the spiral arms is approximately 2-3 higher compared to
that of the interarm regions. The ratio of molecular to atomic surface density
shows a nearly power-law dependence on the hydrostatic pressure P_hydro. The
gas surface density distribution in M51 shows an underlying exponential
distribution with a scale length of h_gas=7.6 kpc representing 55% of the total
gas mass, comparable to the properties of the exponential dust disk. In
contrast to the velocity widths observed in HI, the CO velocity dispersion
shows enhanced line widths in the spiral arms compared to the interarm regions.
The contribution of the stellar component in the Toomre Q-parameter analysis is
significant and lowers the combined Q-parameter Q_tot by up to 70% towards the
threshold for gravitational instability. The value of Q_tot varies from 1.5-3
