developments concerning states with lattice symmetry breaking in the cuprate
high-temperature superconductors. Recent experiments have provided evidence for
states with broken rotation as well as translation symmetry, and will be
discussed in terms of nematic and stripe physics. Of particular importance here
are results obtained using the techniques of neutron and x-ray scattering and
scanning tunneling spectroscopy. Ideas on the origin of lattice-symmetry-broken
states will be reviewed, and effective models accounting for various
experimentally observed phenomena will be summarized. These include both
weak-coupling and strong-coupling approaches, with a discussion on their
distinctions and connections. The collected experimental data indicate that the
tendency toward uni-directional stripe-like ordering is common to underdoped
cuprates, but becomes weaker with increasing number of adjacent CuO_2 layers.

showing agreement and predictions in comparison with string expansion;
speculations on the 'universal' part (upon subtracting the collinear anomalous

The matching coefficient at the heavy particle mass scale depends however on

  Due to the large mass of the heavy colored particle, i.e., the hard scale and
near the partonic kinematic threshold for production of such particles a

receiver wishes to reconstruct each source component with the least possible

The data analysed here consist of spectroheliograms in the continuum around
142.0 nm and in the Si iv 140.2 nm, O iii 70.3 nm, N iv 76.5 nm, and O iv 79.0

line-of-sight velocity and Doppler-width maps. Results: The data show an
asymmetric downflow pattern compatible with the presence of the inverse
Evershed flow in a region within roughly twice the penumbral radius at
transition-region temperatures up to 0.18 MK. The motions, highly inhomogeneous
on small scales, seem to occur in a collar of radially directed filamentary
structures, with an average width less than the 1 Mm spatial resolution of
SUMER and characterised by different plasma speeds. Assuming that the flows are
directed along the field lines, we deduce that such field lines are inclined by
10 deg to 25 deg with respect to the solar surface.

low mass stars with stellar types M0 and later. The PEARS fields lay within the
larger GOODS fields, and we used new, deeper images to further refine the

newly developed stellarity parameter. The total number of stars with reliable
spectroscopic and morphological identification was 95 and 108 in the north and
south fields respectively. The sample of spectroscopically identified stars
allows constraints to be set on the thickness of the Galactic thin disk as well
as contributions from a thick disk and a halo component. We derive a thin disk
scale height, as traced by the population of M4 to M9 dwarfs along two
independent lines of sight, of h_thin = 370 +60/-65 pc. When including the more
massive M0 to M4 dwarf population, we derive h_thin = 300 +/- 70pc. In both
cases, we observe that we must include a combination of thick and halo
components in our models in order to account for the observed numbers of faint
dwarfs. The required thick disk scale height is typically h_thick=1000 pc and
the acceptable relative stellar densities of the thin disk to thick disk and
the thin disk to halo components are in the range of 0.00025<f_halo<0.0005 and
0.05<f_thick<0.08 and are somewhat dependent on whether the more massive M0 to

and a constraint structure apparently distinct from the ADM action and the ADM
constraint structure in that secondary first class constraints as well as
tertiary first class constraints arise with an unusual Poisson Bracket (PB)
algebra [24]. By canonical transformations of the fundamental fields we show
how from the tertiary constraints one may derive the Hamiltonian and momentum
constraints. Special attention is paid to the Hamiltonian formulation of the
first order EH action in terms of the variables h, h^i and q^{ij} employed in
[19,20]. It is shown that the variables h and h^i are left undetermined in the
formalism. This fact is used for a proper gauge fixation of the secondary
constraints and reduction to the Faddeev action [19,20]. Considering
invariances of the total action, the generator of the gauge transformations of
the EH Lagrangian action is derived. Using this generator, the explicit form of
the gauge invariance of the field h is obtained, by which the relation between
the gauge functions and the descriptors of the diffeomorphism invariance is
determined in order for the gauge transformations to correspond to
diffeomorphism invariance. By linearizing the novel Hamiltonian formulation of

that are predominantly ionized in the chromosphere, are enriched in the corona
by a factor 3-4. We model the propagation of Alfven waves through the
chromosphere using a non-WKB treatment, and evaluate the ponderomotive force
associated with these waves. Under solar conditions, this is generally pointed
upwards in the chromosphere, and enhances the abundance of chromospheric ions
in the corona. Our new approach captures the essentials of the solar coronal
abundance anomalies, including the depletion of He relative to H, and also the
putative depletion of Ne, recently discussed in the literature. We also argue
that the FIP effect provides the strongest evidence to date for energy fluxes
of Alfven waves sufficient to heat the corona. However it appears that these

regular fractionation pattern without strong variations from loop to loop

greater relevance than ever, as precision cosmology promises to verify
inflationary predictions about the curvature of the Universe. We revisit the
question of what can be learnt about the spatial geometry of the Universe from
the perspective of a three-way Bayesian model comparison. We show that, given
current data, the probability that the Universe is spatially infinite lies
between 67% and 98%, depending on the choice of priors. For the strongest prior
choice, we find odds of order 50:1 (200:1) in favour of a flat Universe when
compared with a closed (open) model. We also report a robust, prior-independent
lower limit to the number of Hubble spheres in the Universe, N_U > 5 (at 99%
confidence). We forecast the accuracy with which future CMB and BAO
observations will be able to constrain curvature, finding that a cosmic
variance limited CMB experiment together with an SKA-like BAO observation will
constrain curvature with a precision of about sigma ~ 4.5x10^{-4}. We
demonstrate that the risk of 'model confusion' (i.e., wrongly favouring a flat
Universe in the presence of curvature) is much larger than might be assumed
from parameter errors forecasts for future probes. We argue that a 5-sigma
detection threshold guarantees a confusion- and ambiguity-free model selection.
Together with inflationary arguments, this implies that the geometry of the
Universe is not knowable if the value of the curvature parameter is below
|Omega_curvature| ~ 10^{-4}, a bound one order of magnitude larger than the
size of curvature perturbations, ~ 10^{-5}. [abridged]

hydrogen from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The common denominator of these
experiments are the large data sets produced, contaminated by various
instrumental effects, ionospheric distortions, RFI and strong Galactic and
extragalactic foregrounds. In this paper, the first in a series, we present the
Data Model that will be the basis of the signal analysis for the LOFAR (Low
Frequency Array) EoR Key Science Project (LOFAR EoR KSP). Using this data model
we simulate realistic visibility data sets over a wide frequency band, taking
properly into account all currently known instrumental corruptions (e.g.
direction-dependent gains, complex gains, polarization effects, noise, etc). We
then apply primary calibration errors to the data in a statistical sense,
assuming that the calibration errors are random Gaussian variates at a level
consistent with our current knowledge based on observations with the LOFAR Core
Station 1. Our aim is to demonstrate how the systematics of an interferometric
measurement affect the quality of the calibrated data, how errors correlate and
propagate, and in the long run how this can lead to new calibration strategies.
We present results of these simulations and the inversion process and
extraction procedure. We also discuss some general properties of the coherency
matrix and Jones formalism that might prove useful in solving the calibration
problem of aperture synthesis arrays. We conclude that even in the presence of
realistic noise and instrumental errors, the statistical signature of the EoR
signal can be detected by LOFAR with relatively small errors. A detailed study
of the statistical properties of our data model and more complex instrumental
models will be considered in the future.

rates within a quasiclassical approach. While previous studies mainly have
focused on the clean or dirty limits, our results grant access to the regime of
intermediate impurity concentrations, thus allowing us to probe the crossover
from the clean to dirty limit. We find that in the crossover regime, all
possible symmetry correlations of the proximity-induced anomalous Green's
function are induced in the ferromagnet. We also point out that the local
density of states oscillates spatially, not only for an F/S bilayer, but also
for a normal/superconductor (N/S) bilayer in the diffusive limit, a fact which
appears to have gone unnoticed in the literature. Within the weak-proximity
effect regime, we present compact analytical expressions valid for arbitrary
exchange fields and impurity scattering rates for \textit{i)} the local density
of states in an F/S bilayer, \textit{ii)} the Josephson current in an S/F/S
junction, and \textit{iii)} the critical temperature in an F/S/F multilayer.
For all cases, we study in particular the crossover regime between diffusive

show that any Bondi-Hoyle accretion of contaminated residual gas from the natal
star cluster made a negligible contribution to the primordial Al-26 inventory
of the Solar System. These results are consistent with the absence of the
oxygen isotopic signature expected with any late introduction of supernova
ejecta into the protoplanetary disk. Instead, the presence of Al-26 in the
oldest Solar System solids (calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions or CAIs) and its
apparent uniform distribution with the inferred canonical Al-26/Al-27 ratio of
(4.5-5)E-5 support the inheritance of Al-26 from the parent giant molecular
cloud. We propose that this radionuclide originated in a prior generation of
massive stars that formed in the same host molecular cloud as the Sun and
contaminated that cloud by Wolf-Rayet winds. We calculated the Galactic
distribution of Al-26/Al-27 ratios that arise from such contamination using the
established embedded cluster mass and stellar initial mass functions, published
nucleosynthetic yields from the winds of massive stars, and by assuming rapid
and uniform mixing into the cloud. Although our model predicts that the
majority of stellar systems contain no Al-26 from massive stars, and that the a
priori probability that the Al-26/Al-27 ratio will reach or exceed the
canonical Solar System value is only ~6%, the maximum in the distribution of
non-zero values is close to the canonical ratio.

We derive the radio luminosity function for these AGN, and its evolution with
cosmic time assuming two extreme cases: i) pure luminosity and ii) pure density
evolution. The former and latter yield L_*\propto(1+z)^(0.8+/-0.1), and
Phi*\propto (1+z)^(1.1+/-0.1), respectively, both implying a fairly modest
change in properties of low radio-power AGN since z=1.3. We show that this is
in stark contrast with the evolution of powerful (L_1.4GHz > 5\times10^25 W/Hz)
radio AGN over the same cosmic time interval, constrained using the 3CRR, 6CE,
and 7CRS radio surveys by Willott et al. (2001). We demonstrate that this can
be explained through differences in black hole fueling and triggering
mechanisms, and a dichotomy in host galaxy properties of weak and powerful AGN.
Our findings suggest that high and low radio-power AGN activity is triggered in
different stages during the formation of massive red galaxies. We show that
weak radio AGN occur in the most massive galaxies already at z~1, and they may
significantly contribute to the heating of their surrounding medium and thus
inhibit gas accretion onto their host galaxies, as recently suggested for the
`radio mode' in cosmological models.

spectrum from the star SDSS J125637-022452 has mixed spectral features of both
late-M spectral subtype (strong TiO and CaH at 7000A) and mid-L spectral
subtype (strong wings of KI at 7700A, CrH and FeH), which is interpreted as the
signature of a very low-mass, metal-poor star (ultra-cool subdwarf) of spectral
type sdL. The near infrared (NIR) (J-Ks) colors from 2MASS shows the object to
be significantly bluer compared to normal L dwarfs, which is probably due a
strong collision induced absorption (CIA) due to H2 molecule. This is
consistent with the idea that CIA from H2 is more pronounced at low
metallicities. Proper motion and radial velocity measurements also indicate
that the star is kinematically ""hot"" and probably associated with the Galactic
halo population.

non-constant acceleration and expansion.
  We exploit the multiscale nature of CMEs to extract structure with a
multiscale decomposition, akin to a Canny edge detector. Spatio-temporal
filtering highlights the CME front as it propagates in time. We apply an
ellipse parameterisation of the front to extract the kinematics (height,
velocity, acceleration) and changing morphology (width, orientation).
  The kinematic evolution of the CMEs discussed in this paper have been shown
to differ from existing catalogues. These catalogues are based upon
running-difference techniques that can lead to over-estimating CME heights. Our
resulting kinematic curves are not well-fitted with the constant acceleration
model. It is shown that some events have high acceleration below $\sim$5
R$_{\sun}$. Furthermore, we find that the CME angular widths measured by these
catalogues are over-estimated, and indeed for some events our analysis shows
non-constant CME expansion across the plane-of-sky.

the Coriolis force, the diurnal thermal forcing can excite internal waves
propagating into the planet's interior when the thermal forcing period is
longer than the sound crossing time of the planet's surface. When the Coriolis
effect is taken into consideration, the latitude-dependent stellar heating can
excite weak internal waves (g modes) and/or strong baroclinic Rossby waves
(buoyant r modes) depending on the asynchrony of the planet. When the planet
spins faster than its orbital motion (i.e. retrograde thermal forcing), these
waves carry negative angular momentum and are damped by radiative loss as they
propagate downwards from the upper layer of the radiative zone. As a result,
angular momentum is transferred from the lower layer of the radiative zone to
the upper layer and generates a vertical shear. We estimate the resulting
internal torques for different rotation periods based on the parameters of HD

that a small collection of linear projections of a sparse signal contains
enough information for stable recovery. In this paper we introduce a new theory
for distributed compressive sensing (DCS) that enables new distributed coding
algorithms for multi-signal ensembles that exploit both intra- and inter-signal
correlation structures. The DCS theory rests on a new concept that we term the
joint sparsity of a signal ensemble. Our theoretical contribution is to
characterize the fundamental performance limits of DCS recovery for jointly
sparse signal ensembles in the noiseless measurement setting; our result
connects single-signal, joint, and distributed (multi-encoder) compressive
sensing. To demonstrate the efficacy of our framework and to show that
additional challenges such as computational tractability can be addressed, we
study in detail three example models for jointly sparse signals. For these
models, we develop practical algorithms for joint recovery of multiple signals
from incoherent projections. In two of our three models, the results are
asymptotically best-possible, meaning that both the upper and lower bounds
match the performance of our practical algorithms. Moreover, simulations
indicate that the asymptotics take effect with just a moderate number of
signals. DCS is immediately applicable to a range of problems in sensor arrays
and networks.

diameters all grown along [111] direction and reveal interesting trends between
cohesive energy and nanowire type with varying diameters. Generally, the
average cohesive energy of nanowires with wurtzite stacking is higher than
those with zinc blende stacking for small diameters. We found that most of the
bare nanowires considered here are semiconducting and continue to be
semiconducting upon the passivation of surface dangling bonds with hydrogen
atom. However, the surface states associated with the surface atoms having two
dangling bonds in zinc blende stacking occur in the band gap and can decrease
the band gap to change the nanowire from semiconducting to metallic state.
These nanowires become semiconducting upon hydrogen passivation. Even if the
band gap of some nanowires decreases with increasing diameter and hence reveals
the quantum confinement effect, generally the band gap variation is rather
complex and depends on the type and geometry, diameter, type of relaxation and
also whether the dangling bonds of surface atoms are saturated with hydrogen.

efforts to constrain structure formation models, the normalisation of the
matter power spectrum and the cosmological matter density, and the nature and
evolution of dark energy. Large weak lensing surveys of ~20,000 galaxy clusters
and groups will be key tools in the observational pursuit of that goal. These
weak lensing studies often proceed by stacking the lensing signals of many
clusters and groups binned by mass-correlated observables such as richness and
luminosity; typically such analyses ignore the triaxial structure of dark
matter halos on the assumption that the averaging of many shear signals within
each mass bin makes its effects (as large as factors of two in mass model
parameter estimates from individual clusters) negligible. We test this
assumption and find that triaxiality can bias 3D virial mass estimates compared
to those for a spherical population by a few percent if suboptimal mass
estimators are used. This bias affects not only direct lensing constraints on
the mass function but can also affect the scatter and normalization of the
mass-observable relations derived from lensing that are so crucial to
constraining the cluster mass function with large samples. However, we
demonstrate that a careful choice of mass estimator can remove the bias very
effectively if the lensing signals from a sufficient number of triaxial halos
are averaged together, and further quantify that sufficient number for adequate
shape averaging. We thus show that by choosing observable bins to contain an
adequate number of halos and by utilizing a carefully chosen 3D mass estimator
stacked weak-lensing analyses can give unbiased constraints on the triaxial
mass function.

presented, and several examples are examined. This is followed by a brief
introduction to entanglement in the context of field modes. The next task is
the quantization of the electromagnetic field in an inhomogeneous, linear
dielectric medium. Before going on to field quantization in nonlinear media, we
discuss a number of commonly employed phenomenological models for quantum
nonlinear optical processes. We then quantize the field in both nondispersive
and dispersive nonlinear media. Flaws in the most commonly used methods of
accomplishing this task are pointed out and discussed. Once the quantization
has been completed, it is used to study a multimode theory of parametric down
conversion and the propagation of quantum solitons.

possible to find a transition temperature with the same set of UV completion

decreases in magnitude in the positive side, becomes negative, and increases in
magnitude in the negative side, indicating symmetry breaking at high

black hole astrophysics can be tested, and the environment of black holes can
be investigated. Since it is not an active galactic nucleus, it also offers the
possibility of observing the capture of small objects that may orbit the
central black hole. We study the effects of the strong gravitational field of
the black hole on small objects, such as a comet or an asteroid. We also
explore the idea that the flares detected in Sgr A might be produced by the
final accretion of single, dense objects with mass of the order of 10^20 g, and
that their timing is not a characteristic of the sources, but rather of the
space-time of the central galactic black hole in which they are moving. We find
that tidal effects are strong enough to melt the solid object, and present
calculations of the temporal evolution of the light curve of infalling objects
as a function of various parameters. Our modelling of tidal disruption suggests
that during tidal squeezing, the conditions for synchrotron radiation can be
met. We show that the light curve of a flare can be deduced from dynamical

5.762072+/-0.000002 s, and 32 X-ray bursts were detected by the XIS, four of
which were also detected at higher energies by the Hard X-ray Detector (HXD).
The strongest burst, which occurred at 03:16:16.9 (UTC), was so bright that it
caused instrumental saturation, but its precursor phase, lasting for about 200
ms, was detected successfully over the 0.5-200 keV range, with a fluence of

is estimated to be ~50 times higher. The precursor spectrum was very hard, and
well modeled by a combination of two blackbodies. We discuss the bursting

effect for massive particles in black holes. The calculations are performed
with the help of Painleve-Gullstrand's coordinates which are associated with a
radially free-falling observer that starts at rest from infinity. It is shown
that if the energy per unit rest mass, e, is assumed to be related to the the
Killing constant, k, by k = sqrt(2e -1) then e, must be greater than 1/2. For
particles that are confined below the event horizon (EH), k is negative. In the
quantum creation of particle pairs at the EH with k = 1, the time component of
the particle's four velocity that lies below the EH is compatible only with the
time component of an outgoing particle above the EH, i.e, the outside particle
cannot fall back on the black hole. Energy conservation requires that the
particles inside, and outside the EH have the same value of e, and be created
at equal distances from the EH, (1 - rin = rout - 1). Global energy
conservation forces then the mass of the particle below the EH to be negative,
and equal to minus the mass the particle above the EH, i.e, the black hole
looses energy as a consequence of pair production.

emission from the Crab pulsar is presented. By taking into account the fact
that Crab pulsar's radiation for the optical and VHE spectrum peak at the same
phases, we argue that the source of this broad band emission is spatially
localized. It is shown that the only mechanism providing the results of the
MAGIC Cherenkov telescope, should be the synchrotron radiation. We find that in
the magnetospheric electron-positron plasma, due to the cyclotron instability,
the pitch angle becomes non-vanishing, which leads to the efficient synchrotron
mechanism, intensifying on the light cylinder lengthscales. We also estimate
the VHE radiation spectral index to be equal to -1/2.

driver for hydrological models that forecast flash floods, and they are
essential for disaster prediction associated with heavy rain. Rainfall
information can be obtained from rain gages that provide relatively accurate
estimates of the actual rainfall values at point-referenced locations, but they
do not characterize well enough the spatial and temporal structure of the

but Doppler radar measures effective radar reflectivity ($Ze$) rather than
rainfall rate ($R$). Thus, rainfall estimates from radar data suffer from
various uncertainties due to their measuring principle and the conversion from
$Ze$ to $R$. We introduce a framework to combine radar reflectivity and gage
data, by writing the different sources of rainfall information in terms of an
underlying unobservable spatial temporal process with the true rainfall values.
We use spatial logistic regression to model the probability of rain for both
sources of data in terms of the latent true rainfall process. We characterize
the different sources of bias and error in the gage and radar data and we

agricultural, hydrological, ecological and other applications. Forecasts from
numerical weather prediction models are often biased and do not provide
uncertainty information. Here we present a postprocessing technique for such
numerical forecasts that produces correlated probabilistic forecasts of
precipitation accumulation at multiple sites simultaneously. The statistical
model is a spatial version of a two-stage model that represents the
distribution of precipitation by a mixture of a point mass at zero and a Gamma
density for the continuous distribution of precipitation accumulation. Spatial
correlation is captured by assuming that two Gaussian processes drive
precipitation occurrence and precipitation amount, respectively. The first
process is latent and drives precipitation occurrence via a threshold. The
second process explains the spatial correlation in precipitation accumulation.
It is related to precipitation via a site-specific transformation function, so
as to retain the marginal right-skewed distribution of precipitation while
modeling spatial dependence. Both processes take into account the information
contained in the numerical weather forecast and are modeled as stationary
isotropic spatial processes with an exponential correlation function. The
two-stage spatial model was applied to 48-hour-ahead forecasts of daily
precipitation accumulation over the Pacific Northwest in 2004. The predictive
distributions from the two-stage spatial model were calibrated and sharp, and
outperformed reference forecasts for spatially composite and areally averaged
quantities.

high-dimensional data vectors to develop an archetypal set of states (nodes)
that span, in some sense, the high-dimensional space. Noteworthy applications
include weather states as described by weather variables over a region and
speech patterns as characterized by frequencies in time. The SOM approach is
essentially a neural network model that implements a nonlinear projection from
a high-dimensional input space to a low-dimensional array of neurons. In the
process, it also becomes a clustering technique, assigning to any vector in the
high-dimensional data space the node (neuron) to which it is closest (using,
say, Euclidean distance) in the data space. The number of nodes is thus equal
to the number of clusters. However, the primary use for the SOM is as a
representation technique, that is, finding a set of nodes which
representatively span the high-dimensional space. These nodes are typically
displayed using maps to enable visualization of the continuum of the data
space. The technique does not appear to have been discussed in the statistics
literature so it is our intent here to bring it to the attention of the
community. The technique is implemented algorithmically through a training set
of vectors. However, through the introduction of stochasticity in the form of a
space--time process model, we seek to illuminate and interpret its performance
in the context of application to daily data collection. That is, the observed
daily state vectors are viewed as a time series of multivariate process
realizations which we try to understand under the dimension reduction achieved
by the SOM procedure.

especially in the study of cosmic evolution. There are several progenitor
models for SNe Ia proposed in the past years. In this paper, we have carried
out a detailed study of the He star donor channel, in which a carbon-oxygen
white dwarf (CO WD) accretes material from a He main sequence star or a He
subgiant to increase its mass to the Chandrasekhar mass. Employing Eggleton's
stellar evolution code with an optically thick wind assumption, and adopting
the prescription of Kato & Hachisu (2004) for the mass accumulation efficiency
of the He-shell flashes onto the WDs, we performed binary evolution
calculations for about 2600 close WD binary systems. According to these
calculations, we mapped out the initial parameters for SNe Ia in the orbital
period--secondary mass ($\log P^{\rm i}-M^{\rm i}_2$) plane for various WD
masses from this channel. The study shows that the He star donor channel is
noteworthy for producing SNe Ia (i.e. $\sim 1.2\times10^{-3} {\rm yr}^{-1}$ in
the Galaxy), and that the progenitors from this channel may appear as supersoft
X-ray sources. Importantly, this channel can explain SNe Ia with short delay
times ($\la 10^{8}$ yr), which is consistent with recent observational
implications of young populations of SN Ia progenitors.

to incompressible MHD, makes it possible to measure the energy cascade rate in
incompressible MHD turbulence by means of third-order moments. In
hydrodynamics, accurate measurement of third-order moments requires large
amounts of data because the probability distributions of velocity-differences
are nearly symmetric and the third-order moments are relatively small.
Measurements of the energy cascade rate in solar wind turbulence have recently
been performed for the first time, but without careful consideration of the
accuracy or statistical uncertainty of the required third-order moments. This
paper investigates the statistical convergence of third-order moments as a
function of the sample size N. It is shown that the accuracy of the
third-moment depends on the number of correlation lengths spanned by the data
set and a method of estimating the statistical uncertainty of the third-moment
is developed. The technique is illustrated using both wind tunnel data and
solar wind data.

(U) while in the others the correlations are represented by an effective field,
the self-energy(single-site approximation). This field is self-consistently
determined by imposing the translational invariance of the problem. Thereby one
gets an exchange split quasi-particle density of states and then an
electron-spin polarization for some values of the parameters $(U,V, \alpha,

lead us to re-examine the hydrogen maps of the Milky Way, from which we
identify the possibility of a symmetric two-armed spiral with half the
conventionally accepted pitch angle. We describe a model of spiral arm motions
which matches the observed velocities and composition of the six major streams,
as well as the observed velocities of the Hyades and Praesepe clusters at the
extreme of the Hyades stream. We model stellar orbits as perturbed ellipses
aligned at a focus in coordinates rotating at the rate of precession of
apocentre. Stars join a spiral arm just before apocentre, follow the arm for
more than half an orbit, and leave the arm soon after pericentre. Spiral
pattern speed equals the mean rate of precession of apocentre. Spiral arms are
shown to be stable configurations of stellar orbits, up to the formation of a
bar and/or ring. Pitch angle is directly related to the distribution of orbital
eccentricities in a given spiral galaxy. We show how spiral galaxies can evolve
to form bars and rings. We show that orbits of gas clouds are stable only in
bisymmetric spirals. We conclude that spiral galaxies evolve toward grand
design two-armed spirals. We infer from the velocity distributions that the
Milky Way evolved into this form about 9 Gyrs ago.
