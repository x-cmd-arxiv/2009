of ultrathin films containing graphene layers synthesized by chemical vapor
deposition (CVD) based surface segregation on polycrystalline Ni foils then
transferred onto insulating SiO2/Si substrates. Films of size up to several
mm's have been synthesized. Structural characterizations by atomic force
microscopy (AFM), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), cross-sectional
transmission electron microscopy (XTEM) and Raman spectroscopy confirm that
such large scale graphitic thin films (GTF) contain both thick graphite regions
and thin regions of few layer graphene. The films also contain many wrinkles,
with sharply-bent tips and dislocations revealed by XTEM, yielding insights on
the growth and buckling processes of the GTF. Measurements on mm-scale
back-gated transistor devices fabricated from the transferred GTF show
ambipolar field effect with resistance modulation ~50% and carrier mobilities
reaching ~2000 cm^2/Vs. We also demonstrate quantum transport of carriers with
phase coherence length over 0.2 $\mu$m from the observation of 2D weak
localization in low temperature magneto-transport measurements. Our results
show that despite the non-uniformity and surface roughness, such large-scale,
flexible thin films can have electronic properties promising for device
applications.

It is interesting to ask: how long-lived are
vacua which are nearly supersymmetric? This question is relevant if our
universe is approximately supersymmetric. It is also of importance for a number
of issues of the physics of the landscape and eternal inflation. In this note,
we distinguish a variety of cases. In all of them the decay is slow. For a flat
space theory decaying to a deep AdS vacuum, the leading behavior of the decay
amplitude, if a thin wall approximation is valid, is ${\cal A} = \gamma e^{-2

breaking generally yields parametrically more rapid decays. For nearly
supersymmetric decays, we will see that it is necessary to compute subleading
terms in the exponential to extraordinarily high accuracy before one can

the quantizers of the form $I(X_{n} \ge \lambda),$ but it is shown to be
asymptotically Bayes. Moreover, by adopting the principle of invariance, we
also investigate decentralized invariant tests with the stationary quantizers
of the form $I(|X_{n}| > \lambda),$ and show that $\lambda = 0.5$ only leads to

experiment. It amounts to transform a classical fluid into a quantum-type fluid
by the application of a quantum-like potential, either directly in a stationary
configuration, or through a retro-active loop to simulate the time evolution.
In this framework, the amplitude of the quantum potential depends on a
macroscopic generalization of the Planck constant, which can be changed during
the experiment, therefore simulating a quantum to classical transition. The
experiment is exemplified here by an application of this concept to gravity
waves at the surface of an incompressible liquid in a basin of finite height,
with particular emphasis on the quantized vortex. We construct a complex wave
function with the height of the fluid in the basin as its square modulus and
the velocity potential as its phase. This wave function is solution of a
nonlinear Schrodinger equation typical of superfluids. The quantum potential is
therefore defined here in terms of the square root of the fluid height. We
suggest two methods for applying this quantum-like potential to the fluid: (i)
by the action of a force on the surface (wind, blower, pressure, field,
etc...); (ii) by a curvature of the basin ground. In this last case the ground
profile yields the quantum potential itself, while usually only the quantum
force is accessible, so that such an experiment is expected to provide one with
a macroscopic model of a quantum-type vacuum energy. These results may also be
relevant to the study of freak waves, which have already been described by
nonlinear Schrodinger equations.

special role of the pion as a q-qbar bound state and as a pseudo
Nambu-Goldstone boson, we postulate that the soft effect associated with it is
significant. This soft factor enhances the nonfactorizable color-suppressed
tree amplitudes, such that the branching ratios B(pi^0 pi^0) and B(pi^0 rho^0)

  We develop a probability calculus based on these more general distributions
that includes definitions of joints, conditionals and formulas that relate
these, including analogs of the Theorem of Total Probability and various Bayes
rules for the calculation of posterior density matrices. The resulting calculus
parallels the familiar ""conventional"" probability calculus and always retains
the latter as a special case when all matrices are diagonal. We motivate both
the conventional and the generalized Bayes rule with a minimum relative entropy
principle, where the Kullbach-Leibler version gives the conventional Bayes rule
and Umegaki's quantum relative entropy the new Bayes rule for density matrices.
  Whereas the conventional Bayesian methods maintain uncertainty about which

about which unit direction has the largest variance. Surprisingly the bounds
also generalize: as in the conventional setting we upper bound the negative log

channel state information. The common models used in analyses either assume
perfect channel state information at the receiver and/or noiseless state
feedback links. However, in practical systems, neither is the channel estimate
known perfectly at the receiver and nor is the feedback link perfect. In this
paper, we study the achievable diversity multiplexing tradeoff using i.i.d.
Gaussian codebooks, considering the errors in training the receiver and the
errors in the feedback link for FDD systems, where the forward and the feedback
are independent MIMO channels.
  Our key result is that the maximum diversity order with one-bit of feedback
information is identical to systems with more feedback bits. Thus,
asymptotically in $\mathsf{SNR}$, more than one bit of feedback does not
improve the system performance at constant rates. Furthermore, the one-bit
diversity-multiplexing performance is identical to the system which has perfect
channel state information at the receiver along with noiseless feedback link.
This achievability uses novel concepts of power controlled feedback and
training, which naturally surface when we consider imperfect channel estimation
and noisy feedback links. In the process of evaluating the proposed training
and feedback protocols, we find an asymptotic expression for the joint
probability of the $\mathsf{SNR}$ exponents of eigenvalues of the actual
channel and the estimated channel which may be of independent interest.

period of 60.65 +/- 0.08 days. Eighteen sets of PCA observations were obtained
over an approximately one month interval in 1999. The flux variability measured

The PCA measurements of the pulse period showed it to decrease
non-monotonically and then to increase significantly. Doppler shifts due to
orbital motion rather than accretion torques appear to be better able to
explain the pulse period changes. Observations with the WFC during the extended
outburst give a position which is consistent with a previously determined PCA
error box, but which has a significantly smaller error. The transient nature of

binary system WR 147 where INTEGRAL and MAGIC upper limits on the high-energy
emission have recently been presented. We conduct a parameter study of the set
of free quantities describing the yet vaguely constrained geometry and
respective effects on the non-thermal high-energy radiation from WR 147. The
results are confronted with the recently obtained high-energy observations and
with sensitivities of contemporaneous high-energy instruments like Fermi-LAT.
For binaries with sufficient long periods, like WR 147, gamma-ray attenuation
is unlikely to cause any distinctive features in the high-energy spectrum. This
leaves the anisotropic inverse Compton scattering as the only process that
reacts sensitively on the line-of-sight angle with respect to the orbital
plane, and therefore allows the deduction of system parameters even from
observations not covering a substantial part of the orbit.
  Provided that particle acceleration acts sufficiently effectively to allow
the production of GeV photons through inverse Compton scattering, our analysis
indicates a preference for WR 147 to possess a large inclination angle.
Otherwise, for low inclination angles, electron acceleration is constrained to
be less efficient as anticipated here.

an absorption profile different than standard interstellar dust and with
evidence for clumpiness. The second component is 3 by 4 pc in FWHM with T=300K,
and we identify it with the cooler body of the torus. The compact component is
tilted by 45 degrees with respect to the radio jet and has similar size and
orientation to the observed water maser distribution. We show how the dust
distribution relates to other observables within a few parsecs of the core of

test if the presence of BHk populations in a given GC is linked to specific
physical or structural cluster properties, we have constructed a parent sample

absence of BHk populations with confidence. We then compare the properties of
those clusters in our parent sample that do contain a BHk population to those

also find that the BHk clusters are consistent with being uniformly distributed
within the cumulative mass distribution of the parent sample. Thus, while it is
attractive to suggest there is is a lower mass cut-off for clusters capable of
forming BHk stars, the data do not require this. Instead, the apparent
preference for massive clusters could still be a purely statistical effect:
intrinsically rare objects can only be found by searching a sufficiently large
number of stars.

the cloud and tracks the radial and vertical motion of material in the

treatment of the dust temperature, which controls much of the chemistry. A
small parameter grid is explored to understand the effects of the sound speed
and the mass and rotation of the cloud. The freeze-out and evaporation of
carbon monoxide (CO) and water (H2O), as well as the potential for forming
complex organic molecules in ices, are considered as important first steps to
illustrate the full chemistry.
  Results. Both species freeze out towards the centre before the collapse
begins. Pure CO ice evaporates during the infall phase and re-adsorbs in those
parts of the disk that cool below the CO desorption temperature of ~18 K. H2O
remains solid almost everywhere during the infall and disk formation phases and
evaporates within ~10 AU of the star. Mixed CO-H2O ices are important in
keeping some solid CO above 18 K and in explaining the presence of CO in
comets. Material that ends up in the planet- and comet-forming zones of the
disk is predicted to spend enough time in a warm zone during the collapse to
form first-generation complex organic species on the grains. The dynamical
timescales in the hot inner envelope (hot core or hot corino) are too short for
abundant formation of second-generation molecules by high-temperature gas-phase

baryons contribute decisively to the evolution of the central region, leading
to an isothermal DM cusp, and to a flat DM density core -- the result of
heating by dynamical friction of the substructure during a quiescent evolution
epoch. This process ablates the cold gas from an embedded disk, cutting the
star formation rate by ~10, and heats up the spheroidal gas and stellar
components, triggering their expansion. The substructure is more resilient in
the presence of baryons. The disk which formed from inside-out as gas
dominated, is transformed into an intermediate Hubble type by z ~ 2 and to an
early type by z ~ 0.5, based on its gas contents and spheroidal-to-disk stellar
mass ratio. Only a relatively small ~20% fraction of DM particles in PDM and
BDM models are bound within the radius of maximal circular velocity in the halo
-- most of the DM particles perform larger radial excursions. We also find that
the fraction of baryons within the halo virial radius somewhat increases during
the major mergers and decreases during the minor mergers. The net effect
appears to be negligible. While the substructure is being tidally-disrupted,
mixing of its debris in the halo is not efficient and becomes even less so with

of both asexually and sexually reproducing populations of diploid unicellular
organisms. We consider two forms of genome organization. In one case, we assume
that the genome consists of two multi-gene chromosomes, while in the second
case we assume that each gene defines a separate chromosome. If the organism
has $ l $ homologous pairs that lack a functional copy of the given gene, then
the fitness of the organism is $ \kappa_l $. The $ \kappa_l $ are assumed to be
monotonically decreasing, so that $ \kappa_0 = 1 > \kappa_1 > \kappa_2 > ... >
\kappa_{\infty} = 0 $. For nearly all of the reproduction strategies we
consider, we find, in the limit of large $ N $, that the mean fitness at
mutation-selection balance is $ \max\{2 e^{-\mu} - 1, 0\} $, where $ N $ is the
number of genes in the haploid set of the genome, $ \epsilon $ is the
probability that a given DNA template strand of a given gene produces a mutated
daughter during replication, and $ \mu = N \epsilon $. The only exception is
the sexual reproduction pathway for the multi-chromosomed genome. Assuming a
multiplicative fitness landscape where $ \kappa_l = \alpha^{l} $ for $ \alpha
\in (0, 1) $, this strategy is found to have a mean fitness that exceeds the
mean fitness of all of the other strategies. Furthermore, while the other
reproduction strategies experience a total loss of viability due to the steady
accumulation of deleterious mutations once $ \mu $ exceeds $ \ln 2 $, no such
transition occurs in the sexual pathway. The results of this paper demonstrate
a selective advantage for sexual reproduction with fewer and much less
restrictive assumptions than previous work.

be folded continuously between any two configurations while preserving the bar

strictly simple configurations, where bars intersect only at their common
endpoints. We generalize the theorem to self-touching configurations, where
bars can touch but not properly cross. At the heart of our proof is a new
definition of self-touching configurations of planar linkages, based on an
annotated configuration space and limits of nontouching configurations. We show
that this definition is equivalent to the previously proposed definition of
self-touching configurations, which is based on a combinatorial description of
overlapping features. Using our new definition, we prove the generalized
Carpenter's Rule Theorem using a topological argument. We believe that our
topological methodology provides a powerful tool for manipulating many kinds of
self-touching objects, such as 3D hinged assemblies of polygons and rigid

self-touching configurations universal reconfigurability results for open

with variation distance for measuring how close to uniform a deck has become.
  The surprising results are that for a deck with only two types of cards (such

by insuring that the top and bottom cards are the same before shuffling. And in
the case of dealing cards for a game with ""hands"", such as bridge or poker, the

In the case of a well-shuffled bridge deck, changing to another dealing method
is as good as doing 3.7 extra shuffles. How the deck is cut in poker affects

Centaurus A using data from the Chandra Very Large Programme observations. The
X-ray spectrum of the emission around the outer southwestern edge of the lobe
is well described by a single power-law model with Galactic absorption --
thermal models are strongly disfavoured, except in the region closest to the
nucleus. We conclude that a significant fraction of the X-ray emission around
the southwest part of the lobe is synchrotron, not thermal. We infer that in
the region where the shock is strongest and the ambient gas density lowest, the
inflation of the lobe is accelerating particles to X-ray synchrotron emitting
energies, similar to supernova remnants such as SN1006. This interpretation
resolves a problem of our earlier, purely thermal, interpretation for this
emission, namely that the density compression across the shock was required to
be much larger than the theoretically expected factor of 4. We estimate that
the lobe is expanding to the southwest with a velocity of ~2600 km/s, roughly
Mach 8 relative to the ambient medium. We discuss the spatial variation of
spectral index across the shock region, concluding that our observations
constrain gamma_max for the accelerated particles to be 10^8 at the strongest
part of the shock, consistent with expectations from diffusive shock
acceleration theory. Finally, we consider the implications of these results for
the production of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) and TeV emission from
Centaurus A, concluding that the shock front region is unlikely to be a
significant source of UHECRs, but that TeV emission from this region is
expected at levels comparable to current limits at TeV energies, for plausible
assumed magnetic field strengths.

inconspicuous but collectively they are completely enclosed within the overall
radio contours of this known SNR. Three of these filamentary groupings are
particularly prominent and optical spectra have been obtained across two of
them. Their morphological structure and spectral characteristics are typical of
optically detected SNR filaments. Very strong [S II] emission relative to H has
been detected with [S II]/HAlpha 0.7 and 1.1, confirming strong, shock heated
emission. This is sufficient to classify these filaments in the likely SNR
domain and therefore indicating a direct connection with the radio remnant.
Other typical SNR emission lines such as [O II] at 3727A, HBeta, [O III] at

strong support to an SNR origin of these optical filaments. The value and
insights that these optical data can provide for known remnants are discussed
along with their relevance to the Galactic nitrogen abundance. A serendipitous
discovery of an adjacent H II region is also briefly described.

play a vital role in recycling metal-rich gas ejected from the bulges and thus
in promoting chemical evolution of disks. Our numerical simulations show that
metal-rich stellar winds from bulges in disk galaxies can be accreted onto the
thin disks owing to hydrodynamical interaction between the gaseous ejecta and
the gaseous halos, if the mean densities of the halos (rho_ hg) are as high as
10^{-5} cm^{-3}. The total amount of gas that is ejected from a bulge through a
stellar wind and then accreted onto the disk depends mainly on rho_ hg and the
initial velocity of the stellar wind. About ~ 1% of gaseous ejecta from bulges
in disk galaxies of scale length a_d can be accreted onto disks around R ~ 2.5

distributions and a current dependence of the total energy are determined for
both states. With no injected current, the energy of the ACDW state is lower
than that of the striped Hall state. We find that the energy of the ACDW state
increases faster than that of the striped Hall state as the injected current
increases. Hence, the striped Hall state becomes the lower energy state when
the current exceeds the critical value. The critical value is estimated at
about 0.04 - 0.05 nA which is much smaller than the current used in the

lattices numerically, by means of transfer-matrix calculations and Monte Carlo
simulations. The lattices include the square, triangular, honeycomb kagome and
diced lattices with nearest-neighbor bonds, and the square lattice with
nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor bonds. Results are presented for the
bond-percolation thresholds of the kagome and diced lattices, and the
site-percolation thresholds of the square, honeycomb and diced lattices. We
also include the bond- and site-percolation thresholds for the square lattice
with nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor bonds.
  We find that corrections to scaling behave according to the second
temperature dimension $X_{t2}=4$ predicted by the Coulomb gas theory and the
theory of conformal invariance. In several cases there is evidence for an
additional term with the same exponent, but modified by a logarithmic factor.
Only for the site-percolation problem on the triangular lattice such a
logarithmic term appears to be small or absent. The amplitude of the power-law
correction associated with $X_{t2}=4$ is found to be dependent on the
orientation of the lattice with respect to the cylindrical geometry of the
finite systems.

Carlo methods based on sequences of random transition kernels $\{P_n\}$ where
the kernel $P_n$ is allowed to have an invariant distribution $\pi_n$ not
necessarily equal to the distribution of interest $\pi$ (target distribution).
These algorithms are designed such that as $n\to\infty$, $P_n$ converges to
$P$, a kernel that has the correct invariant distribution $\pi$. Typically, $P$
is a kernel with good convergence properties, but one that cannot be directly
implemented. It is then expected that the algorithm will inherit the good
convergence properties of $P$. The equi-energy sampler of [Ann. Statist. 34
(2006) 1581--1619] is an example of this type of adaptive MCMC. We show in this
paper that the asymptotic variance of this type of adaptive MCMC is always at
least as large as the asymptotic variance of the Markov chain with transition
kernel $P$. We also show by simulation that the difference can be substantial.

  Case studies in bionanoscience","28 pages, 8 figures",,,,"physics.soc-ph physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The multidimensional character and inherent conflict with categorisation of
interdisciplinarity makes its mapping and evaluation a challenging task. We
propose a conceptual framework that aims to capture interdisciplinarity in the
wider sense of knowledge integration, by exploring the concepts of diversity
and coherence. Disciplinary diversity indicators are developed to describe the
heterogeneity of a bibliometric set viewed from predefined categories, i.e.
using a top-down approach that locates the set on the global map of science.
Network coherence indicators are constructed to measure the intensity of
similarity relations within a bibliometric set, i.e. using a bottom-up
approach, which reveals the structural consistency of the publications network.
We carry out case studies on individual articles in bionanoscience to
illustrate how these two perspectives identify different aspects of
interdisciplinarity: disciplinary diversity indicates the large-scale breadth
of the knowledge base of a publication; network coherence reflects the novelty
of its knowledge integration. We suggest that the combination of these two
approaches may be useful for comparative studies of emergent scientific and
technological fields, where new and controversial categorisations are
accompanied by equally contested claims of novelty and interdisciplinarity.
