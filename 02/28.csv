when it comes to the observed luminosity distance-redshift relation. Besides
the fact that this effect tends to disappear on average over random directions,
we show in this work that based on the Rees-Sciama effect on the cosmic
microwave background (CMB), the Swiss-Cheese model can be ruled out if all
holes have a radius larger than about 35 Mpc. We also show that for smaller
holes, the CMB is not observably affected, and that the small holes can still
mimic Dark Energy, albeit in special directions, as opposed to previous
conclusions in the literature. However, in this limit, the probability of
looking in a special direction where the luminosity of supernovae is
sufficiently supressed becomes very small, at least in the case of a lattice of
spherical holes considered in this paper.

Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM) parameter space, and an independent MCMC
analysis of the dark matter halo properties of the satellites using published
radial velocities. We present a formalism for determining the boost from halo
substructure in these galaxies and show that its value depends strongly on the
extrapolation of the concentration-mass (c(M)) relation for CDM subhalos down
to the minimum possible mass. We show that the preferred region for this
minimum halo mass within the CMSSM with neutralino dark matter is ~10^-9-10^-6
solar masses. For the boost model where the observed power-law c(M) relation is
extrapolated down to the minimum halo mass we find average boosts of about 20,
while the Bullock et al (2001) c(M) model results in boosts of order unity. We
estimate that for the power-law c(M) boost model and photon energies greater
than a GeV, the Fermi space-telescope has about 20% chance of detecting a dark
matter annihilation signal from Draco with signal-to-noise greater than 3 after
about 5 years of observation.

from final state radiation produced by annihilation or decay into charged
leptons, either directly or via an intermediate particle $\phi$. Our analysis
utilizes the experimental gamma-ray flux upper limits from four Milky Way dwarf
satellites: HESS observations of Sagittarius and VERITAS observations of Draco,
Ursa Minor, and Willman 1. Using 90% confidence level lower limits on the
integrals over the dark matter distributions, we find that these constraints
are largely unable to rule out dark matter annihilations or decays as an
explanation of the PAMELA and ATIC/PPB-BETS excesses. However, if there is an
additional Sommerfeld enhancement in dwarfs, which have a velocity dispersion
~10 to 20 times lower than that of the local Galactic halo, then the
cross-sections for dark matter annihilating through $\phi$'s required to
explain the excesses are very close to the cross-section upper bounds from
Willman 1. Dark matter annihilation directly into $\tau$'s is also marginally
ruled out by Willman 1 as an explanation of the excesses, and the required
cross-section is only a factor of a few below the upper bound from Draco.
Finally, we make predictions for the gamma-ray flux expected from the dwarf
galaxy Segue 1 for the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. We find that for a
sizeable fraction of the parameter space in which dark matter annihilation into
charged leptons explains the PAMELA excess, Fermi has good prospects for
detecting a gamma-ray signal from Segue 1 after one year of observation.

shown that the model is equivalent to the gauge field theory of composed two

questions that have been opened by observations carried out in the last years
and that represent the legacy of Chandra and XMM: (a) When and how is entropy
injected into the inter-galactic medium (IGM)? (b) What is the history of metal
enrichment of the IGM? (c) What physical mechanisms determine the presence of
cool cores in galaxy clusters? (d) How is the appearance of proto-clusters at

that a highly efficient observational strategy to address these questions is to
carry out a large-area X-ray survey, reaching a sensitivity comparable to that
of deep Chandra and XMM pointings, but extending over several thousands of
square degrees. A similar survey can only be carried out with a Wide-Field
X-ray Telescope (WFXT), which combines a high survey speed with a sharp PSF
across the entire FoV. We emphasize the important synergies that WFXT will have
with a number of future ground-based and space telescopes, covering from the

that the bag model equation of state with a strong first order phase transition
is in qualitative agreement with the experimentally observed step-like
behaviour in the < m_T > excitation function. The hybrid model with a hadron

correlation function of the particles emerging from the evolving system. A long

theory of symmetries, with simple rederivations of its essential results, with
special emphasis given to the Noether identities for gauge theories. Will this
baggage on board, we next discuss in detail, for Poincar\'e invariant theories
in flat spacetime, the differences between the Belinfante energy-momentum
tensor and a family of Hilbert energy-momentum tensors. All these tensors
coincide on shell but they split their duties in the following sense:
Belinfante's tensor is the one to use in order to obtain the generators of
Poincar\'e symmetries and it is a basic ingredient of the generators of other
eventual spacetime symmetries which may happen to exist. Instead, Hilbert
tensors are the means to test whether a theory contains other spacetime
symmetries beyond Poincar\'e. We discuss at length the case of scale and
conformal symmetry, of which we give some examples. We show, for Poincar\'e
invariant Lagrangians, that the realization of scale invariance selects a
unique Hilbert tensor which allows for an easy test as to whether conformal
invariance is also realized. Finally we make some basic remarks on metric
generally covariant theories and classical field theory in a fixed curved

(pi/14) = 0.2225. These values are very close to those observed in experiments.
The value of |V_{ud}| (theta_C) is based on the fact that different Z2
subgroups of D14 are conserved in the up and down quark sector. In order to
achieve this, D14 is accompanied by a Z3 symmetry. The spontaneous breaking of
D14 is induced by flavons, which are scalar gauge singlets. The quark mass
hierarchy is partly due to the flavor group D14 and partly due to a
Froggatt-Nielsen symmetry U(1)_{FN} under which only the right-handed quarks
transform. The model is completely natural in the sense that the hierarchies
among the quark masses and mixing angles are generated with the help of
symmetries. The issue of the vacuum alignment of the flavons is solved up to a
small number of degeneracies, leaving four different possible values for
|V_{ud}|. Out of these, only one of them leads to a phenomenological viable
model. A study of the Z2 subgroup breaking terms shows that the results
achieved in the symmetry limit are only slightly perturbed. At the same time
they allow |V_{ud}| (theta_C) to be well inside the small experimental error
bars.

renormalization is developed for noncommutative scalar field theory. The
dimensionful noncommutativity parameter, theta, induces several new features.
Fixed-points are replaced by `floating-points' (actions which are scale
independent only up to appearances of theta written in cutoff units).
Furthermore, it is found that one must use correctly normalized operators, with
respect to a new scalar product, to define the right notion of relevance and
irrelevance.
  In this framework it is straightforward and intuitive to reproduce the
classification of operators found by Grosse & Wulkenhaar, around the Gaussian
floating-point. The one-loop beta-function of their model is computed directly
within the exact renormalization group, reproducing the previous result that it
vanishes in the self-dual theory, in the limit of large cutoff. With the link
between this methodology and earlier results made, it is discussed how the
vanishing of the beta-function to all loops, as found by Disertori et al.,
should be interpreted in a Wilsonian framework.

  Worrall","The Evolution of Galaxy Clusters Across Cosmic Time","Science white paper submitted to the Astro2010 Decadal Survey",,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The large scale structure of the present Universe is determined by the growth
of dark matter density fluctuations and by the dynamical action of dark energy
and dark matter. While much progress has been made in recent years in
constraining the cosmological parameters, and in reconstructing the evolution
in the large--scale structure of the dark matter distribution, we still lack an
understanding of the evolution of the baryonic component of the Universe.
  Located at nodes of the cosmic web, clusters of galaxies are the largest
collapsed structures in the Universe with total masses up to 10$^{15}$
M$_{\sun}$. Over 80% of their mass resides in the form of dark matter. The
remaining mass is composed of baryons, most of which (about 85%) is a diffuse,
hot plasma that radiates primarily in X-rays. X-ray observations of the
evolving cluster population provide a unique opportunity to address such open
and fundamental questions as: How do hot diffuse baryons dynamically evolve in
dark matter potentials? How and when was the excess energy which we observe in
the intergalactic medium generated? What is the cosmic history of heavy-element
production and circulation?
  Our current knowledge comes primarily from detailed studies of clusters in
the relatively nearby Universe (z$<$0.5). Major advances will come from high
throughput, high spectral and spatial resolution X-ray observations that
measure the thermodynamical properties and metal content of the first low mass
clusters emerging at z $\sim$ 2 and directly trace their evolution into today's
massive clusters.

an annulus between two infinitely long perfectly conducting cylinders subject
to a generally helical magnetic field. The cylinders are electrically connected
through a remote, perfectly conducting endcap, which allows a radial electric
current to pass through the liquid. The radial current interacting with the
axial component of magnetic field gives rise to the azimuthal electromagnetic
force, which destabilizes the base flow by making its angular momentum decrease
radially outwards. This instability, which we refer to as the
pseudo--magnetorotational instability (MRI), looks like an MRI although its
mechanism is basically centrifugal. In a helical magnetic field, the radial
current interacting with the azimuthal component of the field gives rise to an
axial electromagnetic force, which drives a longitudinal circulation. First,
this circulation advects the Taylor vortices generated by the centrifugal
instability, which results in a traveling wave as in the helical MRI (HMRI).
However, the direction of travel of this wave is opposite to that of the true
HMRI. Second, at sufficiently strong differential rotation, the longitudinal
flow becomes hydrodynamically unstable itself. For electrically connected
cylinders in a helical magnetic field, hydrodynamic instability is possible at
any sufficiently strong differential rotation. In this case, there is no
hydrodynamic stability limit defined in the terms of the critical ratio of
rotation rates of inner and outer cylinders that would allow one to distinguish
a hydrodynamic instability from the HMRI. These effects can critically
interfere with experimental as well as numerical determination of MRI.

of unitary random operators on the d-dimensional lattice in various regimes.
These operators are generalizations of one-dimensional physical models of
quantum transport and draw their name from the analogy with the discrete
Anderson model of solid state physics. They consist in a product of a
deterministic unitary operator and a random unitary operator. The deterministic
operator has a band structure, is absolutely continuous and plays the role of
the discrete Laplacian. The random operator is diagonal with elements given by
i.i.d. random phases distributed according to some absolutely continuous
measure and plays the role of the random potential. In dimension one, these
operators belong to the family of CMV-matrices in the theory of orthogonal
polynomials on the unit circle.
  We implement the method of Aizenman-Molchanov to prove exponential decay of
the fractional moments of the Green function for the unitary Anderson model in
the following three regimes: In any dimension, throughout the spectrum at large
disorder and near the band edges at arbitrary disorder and, in dimension one,
throughout the spectrum at arbitrary disorder. We also prove that exponential
decay of fractional moments of the Green function implies dynamical
localization, which in turn implies spectral localization.
  These results complete the analogy with the self-adjoint case where dynamical
localization is known to be true in the same three regimes.

estimated total background of 0.93+-0.17(stat.)+0.32-0.24(syst.) events. This
brings the total number of observed K+ => pi+,nu,nubar events to seven.
Combining this observation with previous results, assuming the pion spectrum

monitoring at the functional level. Our approach provides several distinct
advantages. First, ScALPEL is portable across a wide variety of architectures,
and its ability to selectively monitor functions presents low run-time
overhead, enabling its use for large-scale production applications. Second, it
is run-time configurable, enabling both dynamic selection of functions to
profile as well as events of interest on a per function basis. Third, our
approach is transparent in that it requires no source code modifications.
Finally, ScALPEL is implemented as a pluggable unit by reusing existing
performance monitoring frameworks such as Perfmon and PAPI and extending them
to support both sequential and MPI applications.

investigate the properties of the hypothetical stationary states that should

those with large quantum numbers. In this first of a series of papers, we
attempt to address this shortfall by developing analytic, non-integral
expressions for the electromagnetic dipole state-to-state transition rates of
charged particles for any given initial and final gravitational quantum states.
The expressions are non-relativistic and hence valid provided the eigenstate
wavefunctions do not extend significantly into regions of strong gravity. The
formulae may be used to obtain tractable approximations to the transition rates
that can be used to give general trends associated with certain types of
transitions. Surprisingly, we find that some of the high angular momentum
eigenstates have extremely long lifetimes and a resulting stability that belies
the multitude of channels available for state decay.

the polar spreads of the angular components of the high-n, high-l eigenstates
and the effects these have on the limiting values of the angular components of
the dipole matrix elements in the case of large l and m and (2) investigation
of the rapid cut off and limited width of the low-p, high-n radial

position and oscillatory behaviour of those eigenfunctions in cases of
arbitrarily large values of n, l and p. The methods have wider applicability
than dipole transition rate estimates and may be also used to determine limits
on the rates for more general interactions. Combining the methods enables the
establishment of upper limits to the total dipole decay rates of many high-n,

using differential equations of three variables: a shape parameter, the
inclination angle $\theta$, and phase angle $\phi$ of the membrane rotation. In
steady shear flow, three types of dynamics occur depending on the shear rate
and viscosity ratio. i) tank-treading (TT): $\phi$ rotates while the shape and
$\theta$ oscillate. ii) tumbling (TB): $\theta$ rotates while the shape and
$\phi$ oscillate. iii) intermediate motion: both $\phi$ and $\theta$ rotate
synchronously or intermittently. In oscillatory shear flow, RBCs show various
dynamics based on these three motions. For a low shear frequency with zero mean
shear rate, a limit-cycle oscillation occurs, based on the TT or TB rotation at
a high or low shear amplitude, respectively. This TT-based oscillation well
explains recent experiments. In the middle shear amplitude, RBCs show an
intermittent or synchronized oscillation. As shear frequency increases, the
vesicle oscillation becomes delayed with respect to the shear oscillation. At a
high frequency, multiple limit-cycle oscillations coexist. For a high mean
shear rate with small shear oscillation, the shape and $\theta$ oscillate in
the TT motion but only one attractor exists even at high shear frequencies. The
measurement of these oscillatory modes is a promising tool for quantifying the
viscoelasticity of RBCs and synthetic capsules.

L2-orthogonal space-time codes (STC) for continuous phase modulation (CPM). In
this approach, we split the STC CPM transmitter into a single conventional CPM
modulator and a correction filter bank. While the CPM modulator is common to
all transmit antennas, the correction filter bank applies different correction
units to each antenna. Thereby desirable code properties as orthogonality and
full diversity are achievable with just a slightly larger bandwidth demand.
This new representation has three main advantages. First, it allows to easily
generalize the orthogonality condition to any arbitrary number of transmit
antennas. Second, for a quite general set of correction functions that we
detail, it can be proved that full diversity is achieved. Third, by separating
the modulation and correction steps inside the receiver, a simpler receiver can
be designed as a bank of data independent inverse correction filters followed
by a single CPM demodulator. Therefore, in this implementation, only one
correlation filter bank for the detection of all transmitted signals is
necessary. The decoding effort grows only linearly with the number of transmit
antennas.

diagram is not a critical point even if the surface energy vanishes at this
point. Sensitivity of the inferred phase diagram to the employed statistical
framework in the case of finite systems is discussed by considering the
grand-canonical and constant-pressure canonical ensembles. A Wigner-Seitz
formalism in which the fragment charge is neutralized by an uniform electron
distribution allows to build the phase diagram of neutron star matter.

states inside the potential barrier induced by a finite-width gate. These
states are localized outside the Dirac cone of continuum states and are
responsible for novel quantum transport phenomena. Specifically, the
longitudinal (along the barrier) conductance exhibits oscillations as a
function of barrier height and/or width, which are both controlled by a nearby
gate. The origin of these oscillations can be traced back to singularities in
the density of localized states. These graphene conductance-oscillations
resemble the Shubnikov-de-Haas (SdH) magneto-oscillations; however, here these
are driven by an electric field instead of a magnetic field.

at a factor of 10 (in amplitude) above the standard quantum limit (SQL) within
a broad frequency band. Such a low classical noise budget has already allowed
the creation of a controlled 2.7 kg macroscopic oscillator with an effective
eigenfrequency of 150 Hz and an occupation number of 200. This result, along
with the prospect for further improvements, heralds the new possibility of
experimentally probing macroscopic quantum mechanics (MQM) - quantum mechanical
behavior of objects in the realm of everyday experience - using
gravitational-wave detectors. In this paper, we provide the mathematical
foundation for the first step of a MQM experiment: the preparation of a
macroscopic test mass into a nearly minimum-Heisenberg-limited Gaussian quantum
state, which is possible if the interferometer's classical noise beats the SQL
in a broad frequency band. Our formalism, based on Wiener filtering, allows a
straightforward conversion from the classical noise budget of a laser
interferometer, in terms of noise spectra, into the strategy for quantum state
preparation, and the quality of the prepared state. Using this formalism, we
consider how Gaussian entanglement can be built among two macroscopic test
masses, and the performance of the planned Advanced LIGO interferometers in
quantum-state preparation.

behaves as a dust. At the next step near two pure de-Sitter or Schwarzschild
horizons we obtain a coupling dependent pressure to energy density ratio. In
the case of a minimally couplling this ratio is -1 which springs to the mind
thermodynamical behavior of dark energy. If having a negative pressure behavior
near these horizons we concluded that the coupling constant must be $\xi<{1/4}$

These two different behaviors of unique matter in the distinct regions of
spacetime at present era can be interpreted as a phase transition from dark
matter to dark energy in the cosmic scales and construct a unified scenario.

Due to the fractal nature of the flow, its continuity condition undergoes
modifications. The conserved stationary fractal flow admits only saddle points
and centre-type points in its phase portrait. Completely analytical solutions
of the equilibrium point conditions indicate that the fractal properties enable
the flow to behave like an effective continuum of lesser density, and
facilitates the generation of transonicity. However, strongly fractal flows
inhibit multitransonicity from developing. The mass accretion rate exhibits a
fractal scaling behaviour, and the entire fractal accretion disc is stable
under linearised dynamic perturbations.
