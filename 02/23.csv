simulation to investigate the statistics of the mass accretion histories (MAHs)
and accretion rates of ~500,000 haloes from redshift z=0 to 6. We find only
about 25% of the haloes to have MAHs that are well described by a 1-parameter
exponential form. For the rest of the haloes, between 20% (Milky-Way mass) to
50% (cluster mass) experience late-time growth that is steeper than an
exponential, whereas the remaining haloes show plateau-ed late-time growth that
is shallower than an exponential. The haloes with slower late-time growth tend
to reside in denser environments, suggesting that either tidal stripping or the
""hotter"" dynamics are suppressing the accretion rate of dark matter onto these
haloes. These deviations from exponential growth are well fit by introducing a
second parameter: M(z) \propto (1+z)^beta exp(-gamma z). The full distribution
of beta and gamma as a function of halo mass is provided. From the analytic
form of M(z), we obtain a simple formula for the mean accretion rate of dark
matter, dM/dt, as a function of redshift and mass. At z=0, this rate is 42
Msun/yr for 1e12 Msun haloes, which corresponds to a mean baryon accretion rate
of dMbaryon/dt=7 Msun/yr. This mean rate increases approximately as (1+z)^1.5
at low z and (1+z)^2.5 at high z, reaching dMbaryon/dt = 27, 69, and 140
Msun/yr at z=1, 2, and 3. The specific rate depends on halo mass weakly:
dlogM/dt \propto M^0.127. Results for the broad distributions about the mean
rates are also discussed.

have a treatable model realizing it in four dimensions. Motivated by the
general idea of the AdS/CFT correspondence, we consider a simple construction:
the Randall-Sundrum 2 (single brane) setup with the Standard Model fields on
the brane and a massive vector field in the warped bulk. We show that in this
model the known properties of vector unparticles -- the nontrivial phase of the
CFT propagator, the necessity and dominance of contact interactions, the
unitarity constraint on the conformal dimension of the operator, and the tensor
structure dictated by conformal symmetry -- follow by simple inspection of the
brane-to-brane propagator. The phase has a physical interpretation as
controlling the rate of escape of unparticles into the extra dimension.
Requiring the correct sign for the imaginary part of the longitudinal
polarization of the propagator, we obtain the unitarity condition m_5^2 >= 0,
which, unlike in the scalar case, is unchanged from flat space. This condition
results in the unitarity bound d_V >= 3, or, more generally, d_V >= D-1 for a
vector unparticle in D-dimensional space. It is instructive to consider the RS
2 propagator in (Euclidean) position space: at large distances it behaves as a
pure CFT propagator, while at short distances it turns into the 5d flat space
propagator. The latter is softer than the former, thus regulating the would-be
divergences of the spectral integral and turning the ""contact"" terms seen at
low energies into finite-range interactions. Upon Fourier transforming to
momentum space, one finds that at low momenta the CFT piece is subdominant to
the ""contact"" interactions.

to check if the interpretation of this phenomenon in terms of reconnecting
current sheet is consistent with the observations. The study is focused on
measurements of the ray width, density excess, and coronal velocity field as a
function of the radial distance. The morphology of rays indicates that they
occur as a consequence of Petschek-like reconnection in the large scale current
sheet formed in the wake of CME. The hypothesis is supported by the flow
pattern, often showing outflows along the ray, and sometimes also inflows into
the ray. The inferred inflow velocities range from 3 to 30 km s$^{-1}$,
consistent with the narrow opening-angle of rays, adding up to a few degrees.
The density of rays is an order of magnitude larger than in the ambient corona.
The density-excess measurements are compared with the results of the analytical
model in which the Petschek-like reconnection geometry is applied to the
vertical current sheet, taking into account the decrease of the external
coronal density and magnetic field with height. The model results are
consistent with the observations, revealing that the main cause of the density
excess in rays is a transport of the dense plasma from lower to larger heights
by the reconnection outflow.

  We show that the observed excess of electron-like events could originate from
the production and decay of a heavy neutrino ($\nu_h$) in the MiniBooNE
detector. The $\nu_h$ is created by mixing in $\nu_\mu$ neutral-current
interactions and decays radiatively into $ \nu \gamma$ due to a transition
magnetic moment between the $\nu_h$ and a light neutrino $\nu$. The energy
measured in the detector arises from the subsequent conversion of the decay
photon into a $\pair$ pair within the detector volume.
  The analysis of the energy and angular distributions of the excess events
suggests that the $\nu_h$ has a mass around 500 MeV and the lifetime
$\tau_{\nu_h} \lesssim 10^{-9}$ s. Existing experimental data are found to be
consistent with a mixing strength between the $\nu_h$ and the $\nu_\mu$ of
$|U_{\mu h}|^2 \simeq (1-4)\times 10^{-3}$ and a $\nu_h$ transition magnetic
moment of $ \mu_{tr} \simeq (1- 6)\times 10^{-9} \mu_B$. Finally, we discuss

computed by diagonalizing the Hessian matrix evaluated at the potential energy
minima for systems with different values of polydispersity. An increase of
polydispersity leads to an increase in relative population of the localized
high-frequency modes. At low frequencies, the density of states show an excess
compared to the Debye squared-frequency law, which has been identified with the
boson peak. The height of the boson peak increases with polydispersity. The
values of the participation ratio as well as the level spacing statistics
demonstrate that the modes comprising the boson peak are largely delocalized.
Interestingly, the intensity of the boson peak shows a rather narrow
sensitivity to changes in temperature and is seen to persist even at high
temperatures. Study of the difference spectrum at two different polydispersity
reveals that the increase in the height of boson peak is due to a population
shift from modes with frequencies above the maximum in the VDOS to that below
the maximum, indicating an increase in the fraction of the unstable modes in
the system. The latter is further supported by the facilitation of the observed
dynamics by polydispersity. Since the strength of the liquid increases with
polydispersity, the present result provides an evidence that the intensity of
boson peak correlates positively with the strength of the liquid, as observed
earlier in many experimental systems.

from the need to solve the \mu problem, involve novel matter species and gauge
groups. These extended MSSM models can be searched for at the LHC via the
effects of the gauge and Higgs bosons or their fermionic partners.
Traditionally, the focus has been on the study of the extra forces induced by
the new gauge and Higgs bosons present in such models. An alternative way of
studying such effects is through the superpartners of matter species and the
gauge forces. We thus consider a $U(1)^\prime$ gauge extension of the MSSM, and
perform an extensive study of the signatures of the model through the
production and decays of the scalar quarks and gluino, which are expected to be
produced copiously at the LHC. After a detailed study of the distinctive
features of such models with regard to the signatures at the LHC, we carry out
a detailed Monte Carlo analysis of the signals from the process pp-> n leptons
+ m jets + EMT, and compare the resulting distributions with those predicted by
the MSSM. Our results show that the searches for the extra gauge interactions
in the supersymmetric framework can proceed not only through the forces
mediated by the gauge and Higgs bosons but also through the superpartner forces
mediated by the gauge and Higgs fermions. Analysis of the events induced by the
squark/gluino decays presented here is complementary to the direct Z' searches

the minimal assumptions behind Bell's inequality are locality and
counterfactual definiteness, but not scientific realism, determinism, or hidden

surfaces at equal values of the radial coordinate. In particular, we define the
corresponding conjugate momentum. We compute the Noether currents for
isometries in the bulk, and perform the asymptotic limit on the corresponding
charges. We then introduce Poisson brackets at the border, and show that the
asymptotic values of the bulk scalar field and the conjugate momentum transform
as conformal fields of scaling dimensions \Delta_{-} and \Delta_{+},
respectively, where \Delta_{\pm} are the standard parameters giving the
asymptotic behavior of the scalar field in AdS. Then we consider the case d=2,
where we obtain two copies of the Virasoro algebra, with vanishing central
charge at the classical level. An AdS_3/CFT_2 prescription, giving the
commutators of the boundary CFT in terms of the Poisson brackets at the border,
arises in a natural way. We find that the boundary CFT is similar to a
generalized ghost system. We introduce two different ground states, and then
compute the normal ordering constants and quantum central charges, which depend
on the mass of the scalar field and the AdS radius. We discuss certain

weak. Although first proposed in cases where the noise variables are
independent, higher criticism also has reasonable performance in settings where
those variables are correlated. In this paper we show that, by exploiting the
nature of the correlation, performance can be improved by using a modified
approach which exploits the potential advantages that correlation has to offer.
Indeed, it turns out that the case of independent noise is the most difficult
of all, from a statistical viewpoint, and that more accurate signal detection
(for a given level of signal sparsity and strength) can be obtained when
correlation is present. We characterize the advantages of correlation by
showing how to incorporate them into the definition of an optimal detection
boundary. The boundary has particularly attractive properties when correlation
decays at a polynomial rate or the correlation matrix is Toeplitz.

exists a class of solutions in which the wave function is self-trapped,
rotationally symmetric, spatially localized with finite support, and spinning
around its center, yet stationary. The stationarity comes from the balance
between the attractive quantum force field of a trapping quantum potential
generated by quantum probability density and the repulsive centrifugal force of
a rotating velocity vector field. We further show that there is a limiting case

discretizing the autonomous continuous-time linear system in \cite{Uykan09a}

often encountered in the analysis of incomplete data sets exhibiting an
underlying factor model with applications in collaborative filtering, computer
vision and control. Most recent work had been focused on constructing efficient
algorithms for exact or approximate recovery of the missing matrix entries and
proving lower bounds for the number of known entries that guarantee a
successful recovery with high probability. A related problem from both the
mathematical and algorithmic point of view is the distance geometry problem of
realizing points in a Euclidean space from a given subset of their pairwise
distances. Rigidity theory answers basic questions regarding the uniqueness of
the realization satisfying a given partial set of distances. We observe that
basic ideas and tools of rigidity theory can be adapted to determine uniqueness
of low-rank matrix completion, where inner products play the role that
distances play in rigidity theory. This observation leads to an efficient
randomized algorithm for testing both local and global unique completion.
Crucial to our analysis is a new matrix, which we call the completion matrix,
that serves as the analogue of the rigidity matrix.

of M31*, the central supermassive black hole of the galaxy, to be L (0.3-7
keV)<= 1.2x10^{36}erg/s, approximately 10^{-10} of the Eddington luminosity.
  From the diffuse X-ray emission, we characterize the circumnuclear hot gas
with a temperature of ~0.3 keV and a density of ~0.1 cm^{-3}. In the absence of
an active SMBH and recent star formation, the most likely heating source for
the hot gas is Type Ia SNe. The presence of cooler, dusty gas residing in a
nuclear spiral has long been known in terms of optical line emission and
extinction. We further reveal the infrared emission of the nuclear spiral and
evaluate the relative importance of various possible ionizing sources. We show
evidence for interaction between the nuclear spiral and the hot gas, probably
via thermal evaporation. This mechanism lends natural understandings to 1) the
inactivity of M31*, in spite of a probably continuous supply of gas from outer
disk regions, and 2) the launch of a bulge outflow of hot gas, primarily
mass-loaded from the circumnuclear regions. One particular prediction of such a
scenario is the presence of gas with intermediate temperatures arising from the
conductive interfaces. The FUSE observations do show strong OVI$\lambda$1032
and 1038 absorption lines against the bulge starlight, but the effective OVI
column density (~4x10^{14} cm^{-2}), may be attributed to foreground gas
located in the bulge and/or the highly inclined disk of M31. Our study strongly
argues that stellar feedback, particularly in the form of energy release from
SNe Ia, may play an important role in regulating the evolution of SMBHs and the
interstellar medium in galactic bulges.

changes along the orbital cycle of 3.9 days, which can be tested at

comfortably within a microquasar scenario, whereas they appear to be compatible
with the predicted behavior for a non-accreting pulsar.

intensity and taking into account the effect of rotational aberration in the

high-frequency interpulse (IP') and the pair of the so-called high-frequency

demonstrated that the observed spectral and polarization properties of the

of dark matter and how it is distributed in the local universe. For systems
several Mpc across like the Local Group, we introduce three self-consistent
independent mass estimators. These account for the antigravity effect of dark
energy treated as Einstein's cosmological constant Lambda. The first is a
modified Kahn-Woltjer model which gives a value of the Local Group mass via the
particular motions of the two largest members, the Milky Way and M31. Inclusion
of dark energy in this model increases the minimum mass estimate by a factor of
three compared to the ""classical estimate"". The increase is less but still
significant for different ways of using the timing argument. The second
estimator is a modified virial theorem which also demonstrates how dark energy
can ""hide"" from detection a part of the gravitating mass of the system. The
third is a new zero-gravity method which gives an upper limit to the group mass
which we calculate with high precision HST observations. In combination, the
estimators lead to a robust and rather narrow range for a group's mass, M. For
the Local Group, 3.2 < M < 3.7 x 10^{12} M_sun. Our result agrees well with the
Millennium Simulation based on the LambdaCDM cosmology.

Kossakowski et al, that a macroscopic body behaves as a thermal reservoir with
well-defined temperature, in the sense of the zeroth law, if and only if its
state satisfies the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition. In order to relate
this result to the relativistic thermodynamics of moving bodies, we employ the
Tomita-Takesaki modular theory to prove that a state cannot satisfy the KMS
conditions with respect to two different inertial frames whose relative
velocity is non-zero. This implies that the concept of temperature stemming
from the zeroth law is restricted to states of bodies in their rest frames and
thus that there is no law of temperature transformations under Lorentz boosts.
The corresponding results for nonrelativistic Galilean systems have also been
established.

categories, i.e. a functor U with values in an additive category Add, which
inverts the Morita equivalences, satisfies matrix invariance, and is universal
with respect to these two properties. For example, the algebraic K-theory and
the topological Hochschild and cyclic homologies are matrix invariants, and so
they factor uniquely throw U. As an application, we obtain for free non-trivial
trace maps from the Grothendieck group to the topological Hochschild homology

can be resolved into individual stars. We measured the proper motions of more
than 6000 stars within ~1.0 pc of the supermassive black hole Sgr A*. The full
data set is provided in this work. We largely exclude the known early-type
stars with their peculiar dynamical properties from the dynamical analysis. The
cluster is found to rotate parallel to Galactic rotation, while the velocity
dispersion appears isotropic (or anisotropy may be masked by the cluster
rotation). The Keplerian fall-off of the velocity dispersion due to the point
mass of Sgr A* is clearly detectable only at R <~ 0.3 pc. Nonparametric
isotropic and anisotropic Jeans models are applied to the data. They imply a
best-fit black hole mass of 3.6 (+0.2/-0.4) x 10^6 solar masses. Although this
value is slightly lower than the current canonical value of 4.0x10^6 solar
masses, this is the first time that a proper motion analysis provides a mass
for Sagittarius A* that is consistent with the mass inferred from orbits of
individual stars. The point mass of Sagittarius A* is not sufficient to explain
the velocity data. In addition to the black hole, the models require the
presence of an extended mass of 0.5-1.5x10^6 solar masses in the central
parsec. This is the first time that the extended mass of the nuclear star
cluster is unambiguously detected. The influence of the extended mass on the
gravitational potential becomes notable at distances >~0.4 pc from Sgr A*.
Constraints on the distribution of this extended mass are weak. The extended
mass can be explained well by the mass of the stars that make up the cluster.

to non-zero temperatures in order to derive equation of state for the pure

sources it is nothing but the vacuum energy density. The key element of this
derivation was an introduction of the temperature dependence into the
expression for the Bag constant. Such obtained non-perturbative analytical
equation of state for the gluon matter does not depend on the coupling
constant, only the dependence on the mass gap, which is responsible for the
large-scale structure of the QCD ground state, is present. The important
thermodynamic quantities such as the pressure, energy and entropy densities,
etc. have been calculated. We have shown explicitly that the pressure may
continuously change its regime at $T_c=266.5 Mev$. All other thermodynamic
quantities are to be understood to have drastic changes in their regimes at
this point. The proposed analytical approach makes it possible to controll
thermodynamics of the gluon matter at low temperatures below $T_c$ for the
first time. We automatically reproduce the so-called ""fuzy""-type bag models

constitutes one of the most robust empirical laws of ecology, quantified by
species-area relationships (SAR). In many ecosystems, SAR curves display a
power-law dependence, $S\propto A^z$. The exponent $z$ is always less than one
but shows significant variation in different ecosystems. We study the multitype
voter model as one of the simplest models able to reproduce SAR similar to
those observed in real ecosystems in terms of basic ecological processes such
as birth, dispersal and speciation. Within the model, the species-area exponent
$z$ depends on the dimensionless speciation rate $\nu$, even though the
detailed dependence is still matter of controversy. We present extensive
numerical simulations in a broad range of speciation rates from $\nu =10^{-3}$
down to $\nu = 10^{-11}$, where the model reproduces values of the exponent
observed in nature. In particular, we show that the inverse of the species-area
exponent linearly depends on the logarithm of $\nu$. Further, we compare the
model outcomes with field data collected from previous studies, for which we
separate the effect of the speciation rate from that of the different species
lifespans. We find a good linear relationship between inverse exponents and
logarithm of species lifespans. However, the slope sets bounds on the
speciation rates that can hardly be justified on evolutionary basis, suggesting
that additional effects should be taken into account to consistently interpret
the observed exponents.

constraints on the internal structure and composition of stars. To begin this
process, oscillation frequencies must be extracted from the observational data,
typically time series of the star's brightness or radial velocity. In this
paper, a probabilistic model is introduced for inferring the frequencies and
amplitudes of stellar oscillation modes from data, assuming that there is some
periodic character to the oscillations, but that they may not be exactly
sinusoidal. Effectively we fit damped oscillations to the time series, and
hence the mode lifetime is also recovered. While this approach is
computationally demanding for large time series (> 1500 points), it should at
least allow improved analysis of observations of solar-like oscillations in
subgiant and red giant stars, as well as sparse observations of semiregular
stars, where the number of points in the time series is often low. The method
is demonstrated on simulated data and then applied to radial velocity
measurements of the red giant star xi Hydrae, yielding a mode lifetime between
0.41 and 2.65 days with 95% posterior probability. The large frequency
separation between modes is ambiguous, however we argue that the most plausible
value is 6.3 microHz, based on the radial velocity data and the star's position

parallaxes and proper motions of masers found in high-mass star-forming regions
across the Milky Way. Early results from 18 sources locate several spiral arms.
The Perseus spiral arm has a pitch angle of 16 +/- 3 degrees, which favors four
rather than two spiral arms for the Galaxy. Combining positions, distances,
proper motions, and radial velocities yields complete 3-dimensional kinematic
information. We find that star forming regions on average are orbiting the
Galaxy ~15 km/s slower than expected for circular orbits. By fitting the
measurements to a model of the Galaxy, we estimate the distance to the Galactic
center R_o = 8.4 +/- 0.6 kpc and a circular rotation speed Theta_o = 254 +/- 16
km/s. The ratio Theta_o/R_o can be determined to higher accuracy than either
parameter individually, and we find it to be 30.3 +/- 0.9 km/s/kpc, in good
agreement with the angular rotation rate determined from the proper motion of
Sgr A*. The data favor a rotation curve for the Galaxy that is nearly flat or
slightly rising with Galactocentric distance. Kinematic distances are generally
too large, sometimes by factors greater than two; they can be brought into
better agreement with the trigonometric parallaxes by increasing Theta_o/R_o
from the IAU recommended value of 25.9 km/s/kpc to a value near 30 km/s/kpc. We
offer a ""revised"" prescription for calculating kinematic distances and their
uncertainties, as well as a new approach for defining Galactic coordinates.
Finally, our estimates of Theta_o and To/R_o, when coupled with direct
estimates of R_o, provide evidence that the rotation curve of the Milky Way is
similar to that of the Andromeda galaxy, suggesting that the dark matter halos
of these two dominant Local Group galaxy are comparably massive.

interface of two fluid phases which are mediated by thermal fluctuations of the
interface. In this system the restriction of the long--ranged interface
fluctuations by particles gives rise to fluctuation--induced forces which are
equivalent to interactions of Casimir type and which are anisotropic in the
interface plane. Since the position and the orientation of the colloids with
respect to the interface normal may also fluctuate, this system is an example
for the Casimir effect with fluctuating boundary conditions. In the approach
taken here, the Casimir interaction is rewritten as the interaction between
fluctuating multipole moments of an auxiliary charge density--like field
defined on the area enclosed by the contact lines. These fluctuations are
coupled to fluctuations of multipole moments of the contact line position (due
to the possible position and orientational fluctuations of the colloids). We
obtain explicit expressions for the behavior of the Casimir interaction at
large distances for arbitrary ellipsoid aspect ratios. If colloid fluctuations
are suppressed, the Casimir interaction at large distances is isotropic,
attractive and long ranged (double--logarithmic in the distance). If, however,
colloid fluctuations are included, the Casimir interaction at large distances
changes to a power law in the inverse distance and becomes anisotropic. The
leading power is 4 if only vertical fluctuations of the colloid center are
allowed, and it becomes 8 if also orientational fluctuations are included.

only the average firing rate while leaving out higher order statistics like
correlations between firing. A stochastic theory of neural networks which
includes statistics at all orders was recently formulated. We describe how this
theory yields a systematic extension to population rate equations by
introducing equations for correlations and appropriate coupling terms. Each
level of the approximation yields closed equations, i.e. they depend only upon
the mean and specific correlations of interest, without an {\it ad hoc}
criterion for doing so. We show in an example of an all-to-all connected
