Matter (DM) particles, mediated by an ultralight scalar, is tightly constrained
by galactic dynamics and large scale structure formation. We examine the
implications of such a ""dark force"" for several terrestrial experiments,
including Eotvos tests of the WEP, direct-detection DM searches, and collider
studies. The presence of a dark force implies a non-vanishing effect in Eotvos
tests that could be probed by current and future experiments depending on the
DM model. For scalar singlet DM scenarios, a dark force of astrophysically
relevant magnitude is ruled out in large regions of parameter space by the DM
relic density and WEP constraints. WEP tests also imply constraints on the
Higgs-exchange contributions to the spin-independent (SI) DM-nucleus direct
detection cross-section. For WIMP scenarios, these considerations constrain
Higgs-exchange contributions to the SI cross-section to be subleading compared
to gauge-boson mediated contributions. In multicomponent DM scenarios, a dark
force would preclude large shifts in the rate for Higgs decay to two photons
associated with DM-multiplet loops that might otherwise lead to measurable
deviations at the LHC or a future linear collider. The combination of
observations from galactic dynamics, large scale structure formation, Eotvos
experiments, DM-direct-detection experiments, and colliders can further
constrain the size of new long range forces in the dark sector.

plane of polarization of the CMB is constructed. This statistic can estimate a
spatially varying rotation angle. We use this estimator to quantify the
prospects of detecting such a rotation field with forthcoming experiments. For
PLANCK and CMBPol we find that the estimator containing the product of the E
and B components of the polarization field is the most sensitive. The variance
of this EB estimator, N(L) is roughly independent of the multipole L, and is
only weakly dependent on the instrumental beam. For FWHM of the beam size ~
5'-50', and instrument noise $\Delta_p ~ 5-50 uK-arcmin, the scaling of
variance N(L) can be fitted by a power law N(L)=3.3 x 10^{-7} \Delta^2_p
(FWHM)^{1.3} sq-deg. For small instrumental noise \Delta_p \leq 5 uK-arcmin,
the lensing B-modes become important, saturating the variance to ~10^{-6}
sq-deg even for an ideal experiment. Upcoming experiments like PLANCK will be
able to detect a power spectrum of the rotation angle, C^{\alpha \alpha}(L), as
small as 0.01 sq-deg, while futuristic experiment like CMBPol will be able to
detect rotation angle power spectrum as small as 2.5 x 10^{-5} sq-deg. We
discuss the implications of such constraints, both for the various physical
effects that can rotate the polarization as photons travel from the last
scattering surface as well as for constraints on instrumental systematics that
can also lead to a spurious rotation signal. Rotation of the CMB polarization
generates B-modes which will act as contamination for the primordial B-modes
detection. We discuss an application of our estimator to de-rotate the CMB to
increase the sensitivity for the primordial B-modes.

the Hubbard model fitted to reproduce the local spin density approximation

and the corresponding band gap in ZGNR can be completely eliminated by passing
large enough DC current through it. The threshold voltage increases with the
ZGNR length (e.g., reaching $\approx 0.8$ V for $\simeq 13$ nm long ZGNR) which
provides possible explanation of why the recent experiments [Wang et al., Phys.

top gates have been studied and characterized by means of Density Functional
Theory calculations. Varying independently the bottom and top gates it is
possible to control separately the total doping charge on the sample, and the
average external electric field acting on the bilayer. We show that, at fixed
doping level, the band gap at the K point in the Brillouin zone depends
linearly on the average electric field, whereas the corresponding
proportionality coefficient has a non-monotonic dependence on doping. We find
that the DFT-calculated band gap at K, for small doping levels, is roughly half
of the band gap obtained with standard Tight Binding approach. We show that
this discrepancy arises from an underestimate, in the TB model, of the
screening of the system to the external electric field. In particular, on the
basis of our DFT results we observe that, when the bilayer graphene is in
presence of an external electric field, both an interlayer and an intralayer
screening occur. Only the interlayer screening is included in TB calculations,
while both screenings are fundamental for the description of the band gap
opening. We finally provide a general scheme to obtain the full band structure
of the gated bilayer graphene, for an arbitrary value of the external electric
field and of the doping.

X-ray periodicity first reported by Hertz and Wood in 1987 was weak or not
detected for most of the mission prior to late 2004, but then became strong and
remained strong for approximately 2 years after which it weakened considerably.
When the modulation at the 4.19 hour period is strong, it appears in folded
light curves as an intensity dip over slightly less than 30% of a cycle and is
distinctly nonsinusoidal. A number of PCA observations of GX 9+9 were performed
before the appearance of strong modulation; two were performed in 2006 during
the epoch of strong modulation. Data obtained from the earlier PCA observations
yield at best limited evidence of the presence of phase-dependent intensity
changes, while the data from the later observations confirm the presence of
flux minima with depths and phases compatible with those apparent in folded ASM
light curves. Light curves from a Chandra observation of GX 9+9 performed in
the year 2000 prior to the start of strong modulation show the possible
presence of shallow dips at the predicted times. Optical observations performed
in 2006 while the X-ray modulation was strong do not show an increase in the
degree of modulation at the 4.19 hour period. Implications of the changes in
modulation strength in X-rays and other observational results are considered.

considerable debate over the last 100 years. The reasons for this are twofold:
(i) Thermodynamic variables are nonlocal quantities and, thus, single out a
preferred class of hyperplanes in spacetime. (ii) There exist different,
seemingly equally plausible ways of defining heat and work in relativistic
systems. These ambiguities led, for example, to various proposals for the
Lorentz transformation law of temperature. Traditional 'isochronous'
formulations of relativistic thermodynamics are neither theoretically
satisfactory nor experimentally feasible. Here, we demonstrate how these
deficiencies can be resolved by defining thermodynamic quantities with respect
to the backward-lightcone of an observation event. This approach yields novel,
testable predictions and allows for a straightforward-extension of
thermodynamics to General Relativity. Our theoretical considerations are
illustrated through three-dimensional relativistic many-body simulations.

Fluids, 20, 075101 (2008)) for the large-scale-circulation (LSC) dynamics of

pair of stochastic ordinary differential equations, motivated by the
Navier-Stokes equations, one each for the strength delta and the orientation
theta_0 of the LSC. Here we extend it to cases where the rotational invariance
of the system is broken by one of several physically relevant perturbations. As
an example we present experimental measurements of the LSC dynamics for a
container tilted relative to gravity. In that case the model predicts that the
buoyancy of the thermal boundary layers encourages fluid to travel along the
steepest slope, that it locks the LSC in this direction, and that it
strengthens the flow, as seen in experiments. The increase in LSC strength is
shown to be responsible for the observed suppression of cessations and
azimuthal fluctuations. We predict and observe that for large enough tilt
angles, the restoring force that aligns the flow with the slope is strong
enough to cause oscillations of the LSC around this orientation. This planar
oscillation mode is different from coherent torsional oscillations that have
been observed previously. The model was applied also to containers with
elliptical cross-sections and predicts that the pressure due to the side walls
forces the flow into a preferred orientation in the direction of the longest
diameter. When the ellipticity is large enough, then oscillations around this
orientation are predicted.

cooperation on scale-free networks is extremely robust against random deletion
of vertices, but declines fast if vertices with the maximal degree are
targeted. In particular, attack tolerance is lowest if the temptation to defect
is largest, whereby a small fraction of removed vertices suffices to decimate
cooperators. The decline of cooperation can be directly linked to the decrease
of heterogeneity of scale-free networks that sets in due to the removal of high
degree vertices. We conclude that the evolution of cooperation is characterized
by similar attack and error tolerance as was previously reported for
information readiness and spread of viruses on scale-free networks.

relativistic observer-participant manner, an operator symmetry of ""microscopic
observer-participation"" called Measurement Color (MC) is incorporated into the
field theoretic structure of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) in the Heisenberg
Picture. It is found that the resultant Measurement Color Quantum
Electrodynamics (MC-QED) contains a microscopic quantum electrodynamic arrow of
time that emerges dynamically, independent of any thermodynamic or cosmological
assumptions. This occurs because the photon has a negative time parity in
MC-QED. This causes a spontaneous breaking of the T and CPT symmetry to be
generated by the physical requirement that a stable vacuum state exists in the
MC-QED formalimm. This dynamically selects operator solutions containing a
causal, retarded, quantum electrodynamic arrow of time due in the Heisenberg
operator equations of motion. In support of the validity of this idea we show
that a classic nonlinear optics experiment in the scientific literature, which
involves a Michelson interferometer using combinations of ordinary mirrors and
phase conjugate mirrors, contains experimental results which support the idea
that the photon has a negative parity under Wigner time reversal and thus
carries the arrow of time in the universe.

correction to the Einstein-Hilbert action, which defines an effective theory:
Chern-Simons (CS) modified gravity. The CS correction consists of the product
of a scalar field with the Pontryagin density, where the former can be treated
as a background field (non-dynamical formulation) or as an evolving field
(dynamical formulation). Many solutions of general relativity persist in the
modified theory; a notable exception is the Kerr metric, which has sparked a
search for rotating black hole solutions. Here, for the first time, we find a
solution describing a rotating black hole within the dynamical framework, and
in the small-coupling/slow-rotation limit. The solution is axisymmetric and
stationary, constituting a deformation of the Kerr metric with dipole scalar
""hair,"" whose effect on geodesic motion is to weaken the frame-dragging effect
and shift the location of the inner-most stable circular orbit outwards
(inwards) relative to Kerr for co-rotating (counter-rotating) geodesics. We
further show that the correction to the metric scales inversely with the fourth
power of the radial distance to the black hole, suggesting it will escape any
meaningful bounds from weak-field experiments. For example, using binary pulsar
data we can only place an initial bound on the magnitude of the dynamical
coupling constant of $\xi^{1/4} \lesssim 10^{4} {\textrm{km}}$. More stringent
bounds will require observations of inherently strong-field phenomena.

considerably advanced our understanding of ISM gas and dust, they cannot

We first
consider a function f defined as the sum of a quaternionic power series

0). At each point p of this ball, f admits expansions in terms of appropriately
defined 'regular power series centered at p'. The expansion holds in a ball
Sigma(p, R-|p|), defined with respect to a (non-Euclidean) distance sigma. We
thus say that f is 'sigma-analytic' in B(0,R). Furthermore, we remark that
Sigma(p, R-|p|) is not always an Euclidean neighborhood of p; when it is, we
say that f is 'quaternionic analytic' at p. It turns out that f is quaternionic
analytic only near the real axis.
  We then relate these notions of anayticity to the class of regular
quaternionic functions introduced in Adv. Math. 216 (2007), 279-301, and
recently extended. Indeed, sigma-analyticity proves equivalent to regularity,
in the same way as complex analyticity is equivalent to holomorphy. Hence the
theory of regular quaternionic functions, which is quickly developing, reveals
a new feature that reminds the nice properties of holomorphic complex
functions.

enough to the Sun for near-surface water ice to sublimate, are conventionally
labeled as ""short-period"" (specifically, Jupiter-family) comets. Remarkably,
some Centaurs show comet-like activity even when far beyond the orbit of
Jupiter, suggesting mass-loss driven by a process other than the sublimation of
water ice. We observed a sample of 23 Centaurs and found nine to be active,
with mass-loss rates measured from several kg/s to several tonnes/s. Considered
as a group, we find that the ""active Centaurs"" in our sample have perihelia
smaller than the inactive Centaurs (median 5.9 AU vs. 8.7 AU), and smaller than
the median perihelion distance computed for all known Centaurs (12.4 AU). This
suggests that their activity is thermally driven. There are several
possibilities for the origin of the mass-loss from the active Centaurs. We
consider the possibility that activity in the Centaurs is triggered by the
conversion of amorphous ice into the crystalline form accompanied by the
release of trapped gases, including carbon monoxide. By imposing the condition
that crystallization should occur when the crystallization time is shorter than
the orbital period we find a qualitative match to the perihelion distribution
of the active Centaurs and conclude that the data are consistent with the
hypothesis that the Centaurs contain amorphous ice.

6 areas of laboratory astrophysics, which we have identified as relevant to the
CFP panel, are atomic, molecular, solid matter, plasma, nuclear physics, and
particle physics. In this white paper, we describe in Section 2 the scientific
context and some of the new scientific opportunities and compelling scientific
themes which will be enabled by advances in laboratory astrophysics. In Section
3, we discuss some of the experimental and theoretical advances in laboratory
astrophysics required to realize the SSE scientific opportunities of the next
decade. As requested in the Call for White Papers, Section 4 presents four
central questions and one area with unusual discovery potential. Lastly, we
give a short postlude in Section 5.

reported around various types of galaxies since the mid-1990s. The colours of
these halos are too red to be reconciled with any hitherto known type of
stellar population, and instead indicative of a very bottom-heavy stellar
initial mass function (IMF). Due to the large mass-to-light ratios of such
stellar halos, they could contribute substantially to the baryonic masses of
galaxies while adding very little to their overall luminosities. The red halos
of galaxies therefore constitute potential reservoirs for some of the baryons
still missing from inventories in the low-redshift Universe. While most studies
of red halos have focused on disk galaxies, a red excess has also been reported
in the faint outskirts of blue compact galaxies (BCGs). A bottom-heavy IMF can
explain the colours of these structures as well, but due to model degeneracies,
stellar populations with standard IMFs and abnormally high metallicities have
also been demonstrated to fit the data. Here, we show that due to recent
developments in the field of spectral synthesis, the metallicities required in
this alternative scenario may be less extreme than previously thought. This
suggests that the red excess seen in the outskirts of BCGs may stem from a
normal, intermediate-metallicity host galaxy rather than a red halo of the type
seen around disk galaxies. The inferred host metallicity does, however, still
require the host to be more metal-rich than the gas in the central starburst of
BCGs, in contradiction with current simulations of how BCGs form.

galaxies at z ~ 2 from Halpha line emission. The galaxies are selected from the
larger sample of the SINS survey, based on the prominence of ordered rotational
motions with respect to more complex merger induced dynamics. The quality of
the data allows us to carefully select systems with kinematics dominated by
rotation, and to model the gas dynamics across the whole galaxy using suitable
exponential disk models. We obtain a good correlation between the dynamical
mass and the stellar mass, finding that large gas fractions Mgas~M*) are
required to explain the difference between the two quantities. We use the
derived stellar mass and maximum rotational velocity Vmax from the modeling to
construct for the first time the stellar mass Tully-Fisher relation at z ~ 2.2.
The relation obtained shows a slope similar to what is observed at lower
redshift, but we detect an evolution of the zero point. We find that at z ~ 2.2
there is an offset in log(M*) for a given rotational velocity of 0.41+-0.11
with respect to the local Universe. This result is consistent with the
predictions of the latest N-body/hydrodynamical simulations of disk formation
and evolution, which invoke gas accretion onto the forming disk in filaments

from SINS, where gas accretion from the halo is required to reproduce the
observed properties of a large fraction of the z ~ 2 galaxies.

keV\lesssim T_s \lesssim 200 keV. We argue that the spectrum emitted during the
breaking out of supernova shocks from the stellar envelopes (or the surrounding
winds) of Blue Super Giants and Wolf-Rayet stars, which reach \beta_s>0.1 for
reasonable stellar parameters, may include a hard component with photon
energies reaching tens or even hundreds of keV. This may account for the X-ray
outburst associated with SN2008D, and possibly for other SN-associated
outbursts with spectra not extending beyond few 100 keV (e.g.
XRF060218/SN2006aj).

LBGs at 1.5<z<2.7. Among the optical spectra, 12 have Ly-alpha emission with
rest-frame equivalent widths of ~5-60AA. The success rate for identifying LBGs
as NUV-dropouts at 1.5<z<2.7 is 86%. The rest-frame UV (1700AA) luminosity
function (LF) is constructed from the photometric sample with corrections for
stellar contamination and z<1.5 interlopers. The LF is 1.7+/-0.1 times higher
than those of z~2 BXs and z~3 LBGs. Three explanations were considered, and it
is argued that significantly underestimating low-z contamination or effective
comoving volume is unlikely: the former would be inconsistent with the
spectroscopic sample at 93% confidence, and the second explanation would not
resolve the discrepancy. The third scenario is that different photometric
selection of the samples yields non-identical galaxy populations, such that
some BX galaxies are LBGs and vice versa. This argument is supported by a
higher surface density of LBGs at all magnitudes while the redshift
distribution of the two populations is nearly identical. This study, when
combined with other star-formation rate (SFR) density UV measurements from LBG
surveys, indicates that there is a rise in the SFR density: a factor of 3-6
(3-10) increase from z~5 (z~6) to z~2, followed by a decrease to z~0. This
result, along with past sub-mm studies that find a peak at z~2 in their
redshift distribution, suggest that z~2 is the epoch of peak star-formation.
Additional spectroscopy is required to characterize the complete shape of the
z~2 LBG UV LF via measurements of contamination and accurate distances.

isomonodromic tau function defined by Jimbo-Miwa-Ueno vanishes on the
Malgrange's divisor of generalized monodromy data for which a vector bundle is
nontrivial, or, which is the same, a certain Riemann-Hilbert problem has no
solution. In their original work, Jimbo, Miwa, Ueno did not derive the
dependence on the (generalized) monodromy data (i.e. monodromy representation
and Stokes' parameters). We fill the gap by providing a (simpler and more
general) description in which all the parameters of the problem
(monodromy-changing and monodromy-preserving) are dealt with at the same level.
We thus provide variational formulae for the isomonodromic tau function with
respect to the (generalized) monodromy data. The construction applies more
generally: given any (sufficiently well-behaved) family of Riemann-Hilbert
problems (RHP) where the jump matrices depend arbitrarily on deformation
parameters, we can construct a one-form Omega (not necessarily closed) on the
deformation space (Malgrange's differential), defined off Malgrange's divisor.
We then introduce the notion of discrete Schlesinger transformation: it means
that we allow the solution of the RHP to have poles (or zeros) at prescribed
point(s). Even if Omega is not closed, its difference evaluated along the
original solution and the transformed one, is shown to be the logarithmic
differential (on the deformation space) of a function. As a function of the
position of the points of the Schlesinger transformation, yields a natural
generalization of Sato formula for the Baker-Akhiezer vector even in the
absence of a tau function, and it realizes the solution of the RHP as such BA
vector. Some exemples (Painleve' II and finite Toplitz/Hankel determinants) are
provided.

galaxies evolve from their initial dark matter seeds to the complex structures

observations and simulations, numerous satellites that may represent these

redshift galaxies have been revealed with monstrous star formation rates, and
the gaseous cosmic web has been mapped through absorption line experiments.
Despite these efforts, the dark matter simulations that include baryons are
still unable to accurately reproduce galaxies. One of the major problems is our
incomplete understanding of how a galaxy accretes its baryons and subsequently
forms stars. Galaxy formation simulations have been unable to accurately
represent the required gas physics on cosmological timescales, and observations
have only just begun to detect the star formation fuel over a range of
redshifts and environments. How galaxies obtain gas and subsequently form stars
is a major unsolved, yet tractable problem in contemporary extragalactic
astrophysics. In this paper we outline how progress can be made in this area in
the next decade.

well-known. An undecidable property can be classified by the complexity of the
formula defining it. This gives rise to a hierarchy of distinct levels of
undecidability, starting from the arithmetical hierarchy classifying properties
using first order arithmetical formulas and continuing into the analytic
hierarchy, where also quantification over function variables is allowed.
  In this paper we consider properties of first order term rewriting systems
and classify them in this hierarchy. Weak and strong normalization for single
terms turn out to be Sigma-0-1-complete, while their uniform versions as well
as dependency pair problems with minimality flag are Pi-0-2-complete. We find
that confluence is Pi-0-2-complete both for single terms and uniform.
Unexpectedly weak confluence for ground terms turns out to be harder than weak
confluence for open terms. The former property is Pi-0-2-complete while the
latter is Sigma-0-1-complete (and thereby recursively enumerable).
  The most surprising result is on dependency pair problems without minimality
flag: we prove this to be Pi-1-1-complete, which means that this property
exceeds the arithmetical hierarchy and is essentially analytic.

strength are calculated numerically in quiet Sun and simple sunspot models in
order to estimate and compare the direct and indirect (thermal) effects of the
fields on helioseismic waves. It is found that the largest direct effects occur
in highly inclined field characteristic of penumbrae, and scale roughly
linearly with magnetic field strength. The combined effects of sunspot magnetic
and thermal anomalies typically yield negative travel-time perturbations in
penumbrae. Travel-time shifts in umbrae depend on details of how the thermal
and density structure differs from the quiet Sun. The combined shifts are
generally not well approximated by the sum of the thermal and magnetic effects
applied separately, except at low field strengths of around 1 kG or less, or if
the thermal shift is small. A useful rule-of-thumb appears to be that
travel-time perturbations in umbrae are predominantly thermal, whereas in
penumbrae they are mostly magnetic.

<r>~0.15-0.2 m) permits access to a wide range of magnetic configurations.
Surprisingly, in the absence of any obvious population of energetic particles,
Alfven modes normally associated with energetic populations in larger fusion
experiments are observed. Using H-1's unique combination of flexibility and
advanced diagnostics, RF-generated plasma in H-1 is shown to have a very
complex dependence on configuration of both the electron density and
fluctuations in the MHD Alfven range. Magnetic fluctuations range from highly
coherent, often multi-frequency, to approaching broad-band (df/f ~ 0.02-0.5),
in the range 1-200 kHz. Application of datamining techniques to a wide range of
configurations classifies these fluctuations and extracts poloidal and toroidal
mode numbers, revealing that a significant class of fluctuations exhibit
scaling which is i) Alfvenic with electron density (within a constant factor)
and ii) shear Alfvenic in rotational transform. This is confirmed by scans
within a single pulse, which can follow mode conversions. An array of optical
and interferometric diagnostics is combined with the magnetic probe arrays to
provide initial information on the internal structure of the MHD modes, and
associated 3D effects. The configurational dependence is closely related to the
presence of low order rational surfaces; density falls to very low values near,
but not precisely at these rational values. Results from a uniquely accurate
magnetic field mapping system, combined with a comprehensive model of the
vacuum magnetic field in H-1 show that magnetic islands should not dominate the
confinement of the configuration, and indicate that the dependence of density
on configuration may be attributable to plasma generation effects.

would then be more luminous than any known Taurus objects of similar spectral
type. We re-evaluate the distance to the LkHa 233 group and find a value of 325
(+72-50) pc, based on the Hipparcos distance to a nearby B3-type group member

complement these observations with archival mid-IR submm and radio data.
Analysis of the CO, mid-IR and radio data result in the clouds being divided
into three distinct groups. We refer to these groups as spontaneous, triggered,
and zapped clouds, respectively. Comparing the physical parameters of
spontaneous and triggered samples we find striking differences in luminosity,
surface temperature and column density with all three quantities significantly
enhanced for the clouds considered to have been triggered. Furthermore, we find
strong evidence for star formation within the triggered sample by way of
methanol and H_2O masers, embedded mid-IR point sources and CO wings, however,
we find evidence of ongoing star formation within only two of the spontaneous
sample. We have used CO, mid-IR and radio data to identify 24 of the 45
southern BRCs that are undergoing a strong interaction with their HII region.
We can therefore exclude ~50% from future studies. 14 of the 24 interacting
BRCs are found to be associated with embedded mid-IR point sources and we find
strong evidence of that these clouds are forming stars. The absence of
mid-infrared sources towards the remaining ten clouds leads us to conclude that
these represent an earlier evolutionary stage of star formation.

Universe has emerged and been actively developed over the last decade. In the
coming decade, non-Gaussianity, i.e., the study of non-Gaussian contributions
to the correlations of cosmological fluctuations, will become an important
probe of both the early and the late Universe. Specifically, it will play a
leading role in furthering our understanding of two fundamental aspects of
cosmology and astrophysics: (i) the physics of the very early universe that
created the primordial seeds for large-scale structures, and (ii) the
subsequent growth of structures via gravitational instability and gas physics
at later times. To date, observations of fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) and the Large-Scale Structure of the Universe (LSS) have
focused largely on the Gaussian contribution as measured by the two-point
correlations (or the power spectrum) of density fluctuations. However, an even
greater amount of information is contained in non-Gaussianity and a large
discovery space therefore still remains to be explored. Many observational
probes can be used to measure non-Gaussianity, including CMB, LSS,
gravitational lensing, Lyman-alpha forest, 21-cm fluctuations, and the
abundance of rare objects such as clusters of galaxies and high-redshift
galaxies. Not only does the study of non-Gaussianity maximize the science
return from a plethora of present and future cosmological experiments and
observations, but it also carries great potential for important discoveries in
the coming decade.

which have an identity diffusion matrix and a drift function that is piecewise
constant and scale invariant. Abstract stochastic calculus immediately gives us
general results about existence and uniqueness in law and invariant probability
distributions when they exist. These invariant distributions are probability
measures on the $n$-dimensional space and can be extremely resistant to a more
detailed understanding. To have a better analysis, we construct a polyhedra
such that the inward normal at its surface is given by the drift function and
show that the finer structures of the invariant probability measure is
intertwined with the geometry of the polyhedra. We show that several natural
interacting Brownian particle models can thus be analyzed by studying the
combinatorial fan generated by the drift function, particularly when these are
simplicial. This is the case when the polyhedra is a polytope that is invariant
under a Coxeter group action, which leads to an explicit description of the
invariant measures in terms of iid Exponential random variables. Another class
of examples is furnished by interactions indexed by weighted graphs all of
which generate simplicial polytopes with $n !$ faces. We show that the
proportion of volume contained in each component simplex corresponds to a
probability distribution on the group of permutations, some of which have
surprising connections with the classical urn models.

fact that the fundamental solutions of the Helmholtz operator of EQFT have a
unique singularity structure, i.e. they are unique up to a smooth part. Second,

in graphene, however, are subject to microscopic perturbations that include
topographic corrugations and electron density inhomogeneities (i.e. charge
puddles). Such perturbations profoundly alter Dirac fermion behavior, with
implications for their fundamental physics as well as for future graphene
device applications. Here we report a new technique of Dirac point mapping that
we have used to determine the origin of charge inhomogeneities in graphene. We
find that fluctuations in graphene charge density are not caused by
topographical corrugations, but rather by charge-donating impurities below the

be continuously modulated by electric gating. Our observations provide new

differential intensity spectrum is a rather smooth power-law spectrum, with two
kinks at the ""knee"" (~10^15 eV) and at the ""ankle"" (~3 10^18 eV). It is unclear
if these kinks are related to boundaries between different dominating sources,
or rather related to characteristics of cosmic-ray propagation. We believe that
Galactic sources dominate up to 10^17 eV or even above, and the extragalactic
origin of cosmic rays at highest energies merges rather smoothly with Galactic
contributions throughout the 10^15--10^18 eV range. Pulsars and supernova
remnants are among the prime candidates for Galactic cosmic-ray production,
while nuclei of active galaxies are considered best candidates to produce
ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays of extragalactic origin. Acceleration processes
are related to shocks from violent ejections of matter from energetic sources
such as supernova explosions or matter accretion onto black holes. Details of
such acceleration are difficult, as relativistic particles modify the structure
of the shock, and simple approximations or perturbation calculations are
unsatisfactory. This is where laboratory plasma experiments are expected to
contribute, to enlighten the non-linear processes which occur under such

rising function of the host's metallicity. However, the data for stars with

The lensing galaxy is modeled with two components (stars and dark matter), and
we include the perturbing effect of the group environment, and all available

convergence and mass density slope, are significantly reduced with respect to
standard systems and infer tight constraints on the mass density profile: (i)
the dark matter content of the main lens galaxy is in line with that of typical
galaxies $f_{\rm dm}(<R_{\rm e})=0.41^{+0.09}_{-0.06}$; (ii) the required mass
associated with the dark matter halo of the nearby group is consistent with
X-ray and weak-lensing estimates ($\sigma_{\rm grp}=550^{+130}_{-240}$); (iii)
accounting for the group contribution in the form of an external convergence,
the slope of the mass density profile of the main lens galaxy alone is found to
be $\alpha=-1.03^{+0.22}_{-0.16}$, consistent with the isothermal ($\alpha=-1$)
slope. We demonstrate that multiple source plane systems together with good
ancillary dataset can be used to disentangle local and environmental effects.

underlying the recently developed Fractional Analytic Perturbation Theory
(FAPT) of QCD and present its main calculational tools together with key
applications. For this, it is first necessary to review previous methods to
apply QCD perturbation theory at low spacelike momentum scales, where the
influence of the Landau singularities becomes inevitable. Several concepts are
considered and their limitations are pointed out. The usefulness of FAPT is
discussed in terms of two characteristic hadronic quantities: the
perturbatively calculable part of the pion's electromagnetic form factor in the
spacelike region and the Higgs-boson decay into a $b\bar b$ pair in the
timelike region. In the first case, the focus is on the optimization of the
prediction with respect to the choice of the renormalization scheme and the
dependence on the renormalization and the factorization scales. The second case
serves to show that the application of FAPT to this reaction reaches already at
the four-loop level an accuracy of the order of 1%, avoiding difficulties
inherent in the standard perturbative expansion. The obtained results are
compared with estimates from fixed-order and contour-improved QCD perturbation
theory. Using the brand-new Higgs mass value of about 125 GeV, measured at the
Large Hadron Collider (CERN), a prediction for $\Gamma_{H\to b\bar{b}}=2.4 \pm
0.15 {\rm MeV}$ is extracted.

triplet-singlet transitions of atomic pairs in the fully spin-polarized sample
are forbidden. The apparent nonzero shift is associated with the
density-dependent wall shift of the hyperfine constant and the pressure shift
due to the presence of H atoms in the hyperfine state $a$ not involved in the
observed $b\to c$ transition. The interaction of adsorbed atoms with one
another effectively decreases the binding energy and, consequently, the wall
shift by the amount proportional to their density. The pressure shift of the
$b\to c$ resonance comes from the fact that the impurity $a$-state atoms
interact differently with the initial $b$-state and final $c$-state atoms and
is also linear in density. The net effect of the two contributions, both
specific for 2D hydrogen, is comparable with the experimental observation. To
our knowledge, this is the first mentioning of the density-dependent wall
shift. We also show that the difference between the triplet and singlet
scattering lengths of H atoms, $a_t-a_s=30(5)$ pm, is exactly twice smaller
than the value reported by Ahokas {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf101},
263003 (2008).

on 3-4 nm thick NbN films grown on MgO (TS=400C) substrates by reactive

we see no dwarf nova oscillations, but there are often quasi-periodic
oscillations in the range 350 - 1500 s. There is a strong brightness modulation
with a period of 3.78 h, which we attribute to negative superhumps, and there

probably a further example of that seen in GW Lib and some other systems. We

the standard ChPT power counting scheme. We discuss the importance of
unitarity, which allows for an accurate high energy description of scattering
amplitudes, generating dynamically the $\rho (770)$ and $f_0(600)$ mesons. Our
results are compatible with analyses of kinetic theory, both in the
non-relativistic very low-$T$ regime and near the transition. We show the
behavior with temperature of the electrical and thermal conductivities as well
as of the shear and bulk viscosities. We obtain that bulk viscosity is
negligible against shear viscosity, except near the chiral phase transition
where the conformal anomaly might induce larger bulk effects. Different
asymptotic limits for transport coefficients, large-$N_c$ scaling and some
applications to heavy-ion collisions are studied.

the arcs $a_1 \cup a_2 \cup ... \cup a_n$ setwise and fixing $D \times \{1\}$
pointwise. This group can be considered as a subgroup of the braid group. The
pure Hilden group is defined to be the intersection of the Hilden group and the
pure braid group.
  In a previous paper we computed a presentaion for the Hilden group using an
action of the group on a cellular complex. This paper uses the same action and
complex to calculate a finite presentation for the pure Hilden group. The
framed braid group acts on the pure Hilden group by conjugation and this action
is used to reduce the number of cases.

Candidate IXO (Colbert & Ptak). An Intermediate-luminosity X-ray Object (IXO)
is defined as an off-nuclear, compact object with luminosity Lx [2-10keV] >=
1039 erg s-1. The cutoff Lx is defined as a value greater than the Eddington
luminosity of a 1.4 Mo black hole (10 38.3 erg s-1). IXO is an early
denomination of what is call now a ULX point source. The Catalog was derived
from a ROSAT survey and represents 87 IXOS in 54 galaxies. IXO6 was selected
because of being positioned in the outer disk of the galaxy, with no near X-ray
source neighbors. The study of this ULX pretends to confirm certain assumptions
related to this class of objects (Roberts et al.)

density under the alternative is separated in the $L_2$-norm from any density
lying in the null hypothesis. The copula densities under consideration are
supposed to belong to a range of Besov balls. According to the minimax

$\log\log$ term loss in the minimax rate of testing in comparison with the
non-adaptive case. A smoothness-free test statistic that achieves the minimax
rate is proposed. The lower bound is also proved. Besides, the empirical

observed the drastic improvement in the confinement of magnetic field lines

non-twist condition that notably acts in the same way the safety profile being

of the amount of flatness of the safety profile in the vicinity of its zero
shear point. All other things being equal, the beneficial effect of the
vanishing of the shear profile is shown to be increased if the radial extent of
the low-shear region is increased. To be specific, the low-shear region induces
the formation of a belt of robust KAM tori acting as an internal transport
barrier whose width is all the larger as the extent of the low-shear region is
broad.

giving the quotient of H by the P-lattice together with the cusps the structure

clearly indicated a substantially smaller value than estimated before. Detailed
modelling of line profile variations for 8 spectra during the eclipse for the

31.8+/-1.8 km/s. The previous determinations of Vsini, based on the HeII 4686 A
line, appear to be invalid because of the large natural broadening of the line.
With the assumption of the solid-body, synchronous rotation of the sdOB
primary, the measured values of the semi-amplitude K1 and Vsini lead to the
mass ratio q = 0.213+/-0.013 which in turn gives K2 and thus the masses and
radii of both components. The sdOB component appears to be less massive than
assumed before, M1 = 0.25+/-0.05 Msol, but the secondary has its mass-radius
parameters close to theoretically predicted for a brown dwarf, M2 =
0.054+/-0.010 Msol and R2 = 0.089+/-0.005 Rsol. Our results do not agree with
the recent determination of Vuckovic et al. 2008 based on a K2 estimate from
