cluster catalog to simultaneously constrain cosmology and the richness--mass
relation of the clusters. Assuming a flat \LambdaCDM cosmology, we find
\sigma_8(\Omega_m/0.25)^{0.41} = 0.832\pm 0.033 after marginalization over all
systematics. In common with previous studies, our error budget is dominated by
systematic uncertainties, the primary two being the absolute mass scale of the
weak lensing masses of the maxBCG clusters, and uncertainty in the scatter of
the richness--mass relation. Our constraints are fully consistent with the WMAP
five-year data, and in a joint analysis we find \sigma_8=0.807\pm 0.020 and
\Omega_m=0.265\pm 0.016, an improvement of nearly a factor of two relative to
WMAP5 alone. Our results are also in excellent agreement with and comparable in
precision to the latest cosmological constraints from X-ray cluster abundances.
The remarkable consistency among these results demonstrates that cluster
abundance constraints are not only tight but also robust, and highlight the
power of optically-selected cluster samples to produce precision constraints on
cosmological parameters.

Repeating patterns of precisely timed activity across a group of neurons is
potentially indicative of a microcircuit in the underlying neural tissue.
Frequent episode discovery, a temporal data mining framework, has recently been
shown to be a computationally efficient method of counting the occurrences of
such patterns. In this paper, we propose a framework to determine when the
counts are statistically significant by modeling the counting process. Our
model allows direct estimation of the strengths of functional connections
between neurons with improved resolution over previously published methods. It
can also be used to rank the patterns discovered in a network of neurons
according to their strengths and begin to reconstruct the graph structure of
the network that produced the spike data. We validate our methods on simulated

cortical neurons.

also to explain a possible origin and a viable explanation of cosmological

revisited in the context of a classical probability distribution of mass, which

because the reddening trajectories in the color-magnitude plane are closely
parallel to lines of constant period. As a result W-based Period-Luminosity
relations have extremely low residual dispersion, which is because differential
(and total line-of-sight) reddening is eliminated in the definition of W and
the residual scatter due to a star's intrinsic color/position within the
Cepheid is also largely insensitive to W. Basic equations are presented and
graphically illustrated, showing the insensitivity of W to changes in the

sense that it does not only mirror some cases of referential interpretation of
indefinite articles in natural language, but may also contribute to philosophy
of language. Finally, we ask the question whether our epsilon within our

computation of semantics of discourses in natural language.

associated to massless normal ordering (MNO), phase space normal ordering (PNO)
plays crucial role in the analysis in the following way. While defining the
quantum energy-momentum (EM) tensor one needs to take into account the field
redefinition relating the space-time field and the corresponding world-sheet
coupling. We argue that for a simple off-shell ansatz for the background this
field redefinition can be taken to be identity if the interaction term is
ordered according to PNO. This definition reproduces the correct physical
spectrum when the background is on-shell. We further show that the right way to
extract the effective equation of motion from the Virasoro anomaly is to first
order the anomaly terms according to PNO at a finite regularization parameter
$\eps$ and then take the $\eps \to 0$ limit. This prescription fixes an
ambiguity in taking the limit for certain bosonic and fermionic contributions
to the Virasoro anomaly and is the natural one to consider given the above
definition of the EM tensor.

Stationary solution of the coupled partial differential equations in a simple

physics, e.g. generation, destruction, collision and reflection of solitons, as
well as turbulence bursting can also be observed due to effects of linear

of green fluorescent protein (GFP) chromophores using a representation over

and competes with fluorescence in these systems. In the protein, this pathway
is suppressed, leading to fluorescence. Understanding the electronic structure
of the photoisomerization is a prerequisite to understanding how the protein
suppresses this pathway and preserves the emitting state of the chromophore. We
present a solution to the state-averaged complete active space problem, which
is spanned at convergence by three fragment-localized orbitals. We generate the
diabatic-state representation by applying a block diagonalization
transformation to the Hamiltonian calculated for the anionic chromophore model
HBDI with multi-reference, multi-state perturbation theory. The diabatic states
that emerge are charge-localized structures with a natural valence-bond
interpretation. At planar geometries, the diabatic picture recaptures the
charge transfer resonance of the anion. The strong S0-S1 excitation at these
geometries is reasonably described within a two-state model, but extension to a
three-state model is necessary to describe decay via two possible pathways
associated with photoisomerization of the (methine) bridge. Parametric
Hamiltonians based on the three-state ansatz can be fit directly to data
generated using the underlying active space. We provide an illustrative example
of such a parametric Hamiltonian.

glimpse of the possibility that dark matter as a light transmitting medium
played a role that accounts for the discordant inferences about the dynamical
behaviour of light, in which some optical experiments cannot detect the earth's
motion in space, while others definitely can. In a converse way, the mentioned
laboratory and astronomical observations provide an accessible experimental
proof for the existence of a transparent, non-baryonic earth-bound medium which
does not occupy the whole of universal space, dark matter being a possible
candidate medium.

J1655-40 exhibited a behaviour similar to its last outburst observed almost
eight years ago. We analyze a total of 150 observational spells in 122 days of
data spreaded over the entire outburst phase of Feb. 2005 to Oct. 2005. From
our study, a comprehensive understanding of the detailed behaviour of this
black hole candidate has emerged. Based on the degree of importance of the
black body and the power-law components we divide the entire episode in four
spectral states, namely, hard, soft, very soft and intermediate. Quasi-Periodic
oscillations (QPOs) were found in two out of these four states, namely, in the
hard and the intermediate states. In the hard state, at the rising phase of the
outburst, QPO frequency ranged from 0.034 - 17.78Hz and the spectra was fitted
by a disk black body, power-law and iron emission line at 6.2 - 6.5 keV. In the
intermediate state, QPOs vary from 13.17Hz to 19.04Hz and the QPO frequency
modulation in this state was not significant. The spectra in this state are
well fitted by the disk black body and the power-law components. In the hard
state of the declining phase of the outburst, we found QPOs of decreasing
frequency from 13.14 Hz to 0.034 Hz. The spectra of this state were fitted by a
disk black body and power-law components, but in the initial few days a cooler
Comptonized component was required for a better fit. In the soft and very soft
states, the spectral states are mostly dominated by the strong disk black body
component.

non-Archimedean local field (of characteristic not equal to 2), (ii) A =
Aut^{0}(T) - the group of orientation preserving automorphisms of a
(q+1)-regular tree, for q > 1.
  In contrast, a recent result of Minsky's shows that the same action is not
ergodic when A = PSL(2,R) or A = PSL(2,C). Therefore if K is a local field
(with characteristic different than 2) the action of Aut(F_k) on D_{k,PSL(2,K)}
is ergodic, for every k>2, if and only if K is non-Archimedean.
  Ergodicity implies that every ""measurable property"" either holds or fails to
hold for almost every k-generated dense subgroup of A.

polarization of gluinos vanishes in the limit in which the small mass
difference between L and R squarks of the first two generations is neglected,
non-zero spin-spin correlations are predicted within gluino pairs. If the
squark/quark charges in Majorana gluino decays are tagged, the spin
correlations have an impact on the energy and angular distributions in
reconstructed final states. On the other hand, the gluino polarization in
single gluino production in the supersymmetric Compton process $g q \to

affects the final-state distributions in super-Compton events.

of our cosmic habitat. The age-old questions have been transformed into two
pressing issues primed for attack in the coming decade: How did the Universe
begin? and What physical laws govern the Universe at the highest energies? The
clearest window onto these questions is the pattern of polarization in the
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), which is uniquely sensitive to primordial
gravity waves. A detection of the special pattern produced by gravity waves
would be not only an unprecedented discovery, but also a direct probe of
physics at the earliest observable instants of our Universe. Experiments which
map CMB polarization over the coming decade will lead us on our first steps
towards answering these age-old questions.
