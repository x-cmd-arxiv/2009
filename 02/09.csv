transition between a Low/Hard State (LHS) and a High/Soft State (HSS). Besides
drastic spectral and timing changes, this transition often shows a discrete
ejection event detectable in the radio range. However, the exact nature of the
ejected material and the mechanisms that give birth to these phenomena are yet
to be unraveled. Recent simultaneous radio and X-ray observations on several
sources point to a coronal nature of the ejected material. In the cases of GRS
1915+105, XTE J1550-564, and the 2002 outburst of GX 339-4, the flux of the
Compton component decreases sharply just before an ejection is detected in the
radio range. Finally, in the case of H1743-322, drastic physical changes
occurred in the corona just before the state transition, compatible with the
disappearance of part of this medium. Thus, the behaviour of at least 4
microquasars points in the direction of an ejection of the corona at the state
transition, feature that is yet to be confirmed (or infirmed) in the case of
other available sources.

adenosine triphosphate, ATP, for living cells. The formation of ATP is
accomplished by a stepwise internal rotation of subunits within the enzyme.
Briefly, proton translocation through the membrane-bound Fo part of ATP
synthase drives a 10-step rotary motion of the ring of c subunits with respect
to the non-rotating subunits a and b. This rotation is transmitted to the gamma
and epsilon subunits of the F1 sector resulting in 120 degree steps. In order
to unravel this symmetry mismatch we monitor subunit rotation by a
single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) approach using
three fluorophores specifically attached to the enzyme: one attached to the F1
motor, another one to the Fo motor, and the third one to a non-rotating
subunit. To reduce photophysical artifacts due to spectral fluctuations of the
single fluorophores, a duty cycle-optimized alternating three-laser scheme
(DCO-ALEX) has been developed. Simultaneous observation of the stepsizes for
both motors allows the detection of reversible elastic deformations between the
rotor parts of Fo and F1.

coupled oscillators is an example for a dynamic critical point far from
thermodynamic equilibrium. The universal behaviors of such critical
oscillators, arranged on a lattice in a $d$-dimensional space and coupled by
nearest neighbors interactions, can be studied using field theoretical methods.
The field theory associated with the critical point of a homogeneous
oscillatory instability (or Hopf bifurcation of coupled oscillators) is the
complex Ginzburg-Landau equation with additive noise. We perform a perturbative
renormalization group (RG) study in a $4-\epsilon$ dimensional space. We
develop an RG scheme that eliminates the phase and frequency of the
oscillations using a scale-dependent oscillating reference frame. Within a
Callan-Symanzik RG scheme to two-loop order in perturbation theory, we find
that the RG fixed point is formally related to the one of the model $A$
dynamics of the real Ginzburg-Landau theory with an O(2) symmetry of the order
parameter. Therefore, the dominant critical exponents for coupled oscillators
are the same as for this equilibrium field theory. This formal connection with
an equilibrium critical point imposes a relation between the correlation and
response functions of coupled oscillators in the critical regime. Since the
system operates far from thermodynamic equilibrium, a strong violation of the
fluctuation-dissipation relation occurs and is characterized by a universal
divergence of an effective temperature. The formal relation between critical
oscillators and equilibrium critical points suggests that long-range phase
order exists in critical oscillators above two dimensions.

question of why there is cultural diversity given that people's beliefs have a
tendency to become more similar to each other's as people interact repeatedly.
The answer depends on the two control parameters of the model, namely, the
number $F$ of cultural features that characterize each agent, and the number
$q$ of traits that each feature can take on, as well as on the size $A$ of the
territory or, equivalently, on the number of interacting agents. Here we
investigate the dependence of the number $C$ of distinct coexisting cultures on
the area $A$ in Axelrod's model -- the culture-area relationship -- through
extensive Monte Carlo simulations. We find a non-monotonous culture-area
relation, for which the number of cultures decreases when the area grows beyond
a certain size, provided that $q$ is smaller than a threshold value $q_c = q_c
(F)$ and $F \geq 3$. In the limit of infinite area, this threshold value
signals the onset of a discontinuous transition between a globalized regime
marked by a uniform culture (C=1), and a completely polarized regime where all
$C = q^F$ possible cultures coexist. Otherwise the culture-area relation
exhibits the typical behavior of the species-area relation, i.e., a
monotonically increasing curve the slope of which is steep at first and
steadily levels off at some maximum diversity value.

conventional charge quantum Hall effect \cite{Klitzing,Tsui} dictates that an
electronic excitation gap is generated in the sample bulk, but metallic
conduction is permitted at the boundary. Recent theoretical models suggest that
certain bulk insulators with large spin-orbit interactions may also naturally
support conducting topological boundary states in the extreme quantum limit,
which opens up the possibility for studying unusual quantum Hall-like phenomena
in zero external magnetic field. Bulk Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$ single crystals are
expected to be prime candidates for one such unusual Hall phase of matter known
as the topological insulator. The hallmark of a topological insulator is the
existence of metallic surface states that are higher dimensional analogues of
the edge states that characterize a spin Hall insulator. In addition to its
interesting boundary states, the bulk of Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$ is predicted to
exhibit three-dimensional Dirac particles, another topic of heightened current
interest. Here, using incident-photon-energy-modulated (IPEM-ARPES), we report
the first direct observation of massive Dirac particles in the bulk of
Bi$_{0.9}$Sb$_{0.1}$, locate the Kramers' points at the sample's boundary and
provide a comprehensive mapping of the topological Dirac insulator's gapless
surface modes. These findings taken together suggest that the observed surface
state on the boundary of the bulk insulator is a realization of the much sought
exotic ""topological metal"". They also suggest that this material has potential
application in developing next-generation quantum computing devices.

X-ray observations of six additional sources of this class has enabled us to
place the strongest constraints yet on the X-ray properties of this remarkable
class of AGNs. Although our data cannot rule out the possibility that the
emission lines are overwhelmed by a relativistically boosted continuum, as
manifested by BL Lac objects, we find that WLQs are considerably weaker in the
X-ray and radio bands than the majority of BL Lacs found at much lower
redshifts. If WLQs are high-redshift BL Lacs, then it is difficult to explain
the lack of a large parent population of X-ray and radio bright weak-lined
sources at high redshift. We also consider the possibility that WLQs are
quasars with extreme properties, and in particular that the emission lines are
suppressed by high accretion rates. Using joint spectral fitting of the X-ray
spectra of 11 WLQs we find that the mean photon index in the hard X-ray band is
consistent with those observed in typical radio-quiet AGNs with no hint of an
unusually steep hard-X-ray spectrum. This result poses a challenge to the
hypothesis that WLQs have extremely high accretion rates, and we discuss
additional observations required to test this idea.

a matter of debate. In particular, protostellar outflows have been proposed as
a source of turbulence in cluster-forming clumps, which may provide support
against global collapse for several free-fall times.
  Here, we seek to test the above hypothesis in the case of the well-documented
NGC 2264-C protocluster, byquantifying the amount of turbulence and support
injected in the surrounding medium by protostellar outflows.
  Using the HERA heterodyne array on the IRAM 30m telescope, we carried out an
extensive mapping of NGC 2264-C in the three molecular line transitions
12CO(2-1), 13CO(2-1), and C18O(2-1). We found widespread high-velocity 12CO
emission, testifying to the presence of eleven outflow lobes, closely linked to
the compact millimeter continuum sources previously detected in the
protocluster.
  We carried out a detailed analysis of the dynamical parameters of these
outflows, including a quantitative evaluation of the overall momentum flux
injected in the cluster-forming clump. These dynamical parameters were compared
to the gravitational and turbulent properties of the clump.
  We show that the population of protostellar outflows identified in NGC 2264-C
are likely to contribute a significant fraction of the observed turbulence but
cannot efficiently support the protocluster against global collapse. Gravity
appears to largely dominate the dynamics of the NGC 2264-C clump at the present
time. It is however possible that an increase in the star formation rate during
the further evolution of the protocluster will trigger sufficient outflows to
finally halt the contraction of the cloud.

Newton-Cartan like limit of Einstein's equations in anti de Sitter space which

due to the Strutinsky-Denisov induced polarisation mechanism may give rise to
such an effect. Earlier, this mechanism was shown to fit the non-statistical
part observed in the gamma spectrum from spontaneous fission of Cf-252. The
calculated value of the magnitude of the asymmetry parameter is on the level of
10$^{-4}$. That is in agreement with the current experimental data. A crucial
experiment to give a more definite picture of the concrete mechanism would be
determination of the energy of the quanta responsible for the asymmetry.
Detection of the quanta with the energy of ~5 MeV approaching the giant dipole
resonance is needed in order to identify prompt gamma rays emitted at the stage
of fissioning.

only through the frictional effect generated at the point of the contact. We

force and a magnetic force at the contact point between the C60 fullerene and
the graphene sheet or the inner surface of the single-walled carbon nanotube,
induces the C60 molecule to spin and precess from a standing up position to a
lying down position. Unlike the classical tippe top, the nanoscale tippe top
does not flip over since the gravitational effect is not sufficient at the nano
scale. After the precession, while the molecular top spins about its lying down
axis, if we apply the opposite retarding magnetic force at the contact point,
then the molecule will return to its standing up position. The standing up and
the lying down configurations of the nano tippe top during the precession and
retraction processes demonstrate its potential use as a memory device in
nano-computing.

minimum delay achievable in a P2P streaming network. In a homogeneous scenario,
we derive a performance bound for such metric, and we show how this bound
relates to two fundamental parameters: the upload bandwidth available at each

k-step Fibonacci sequences do emerge, and appear to set the fundamental laws

while selfishly minimizing the link creation costs plus the sum of the
distances to all other players (usage cost). In this paper, we pursue two
important facets of the network creation game. First, we study extensively a
natural version of the game, called the cooperative model, where nodes can
collaborate and share the cost of creating any edge in the host graph. We prove
the first nontrivial bounds in this model, establishing that the price of
anarchy is polylogarithmic in n for all values of &#945; in complete host
graphs. This bound is the first result of this type for any version of the
network creation game; most previous general upper bounds are polynomial in n.
Interestingly, we also show that equilibrium graphs have polylogarithmic
diameter for the most natural range of \alpha (at most n polylg n). Second, we
study the impact of the natural assumption that the host graph is a general
graph, not necessarily complete. This model is a simple example of nonuniform
creation costs among the edges (effectively allowing weights of \alpha and
\infty). We prove the first assemblage of upper and lower bounds for this
context, stablishing nontrivial tight bounds for many ranges of \alpha, for
both the unilateral and cooperative versions of network creation. In
particular, we establish polynomial lower bounds for both versions and many
ranges of \alpha, even for this simple nonuniform cost model, which sharply
contrasts the conjectured constant bounds for these games in complete (uniform)
graphs.

pure de Sitter space, here we are mainly interested on the effects induced by
the presence of the string. So this analysis is developed by expressing the
complete Wightman function as the sum of two terms: The first one corresponds
to the bulk where the cosmic string is absent and the second one is induced by
the presence of the string. By using the Abel-Plana summation formula, we show
that for points away from the string the latter is finite at the coincidence
limit and it is used to evaluate the vacuum averages of the square of the field
and the energy-momentum tensor induced by the cosmic string. Simple asymptotic
formulae are obtained for these expectation values for points near the string

radius of de Sitter spacetime, two regimes are realized with monotonic and

open? We address this question using the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
(nAChR) as the exemplar. The nAChR is an integral membrane protein which forms
a cation selective channel gated by neurotransmitter binding to its
extracellular domain. A hydrophobic gating model has been proposed for the
nAChR, whereby the pore is incompletely occluded in the closed state channel,
with a narrow hydrophobic central gate region which presents an energetic
barrier to ion permeation. The nAChR pore is lined by a parallel bundle of five
M2 alpha-helices, with the gate formed by three rings of hydrophobic sidechains
(9', 13', and 17' of M2). A number of models have been proposed to describe the
nature of the conformational change underlying the closed to open transition of
the nAChR. These models involve different degrees of M2 helix displacement,
rotation, and/or kinking. In this study, we use a simple pore expansion method
(previously used to model opening of potassium channels) to generate a series
of progressively wider models of the nAChR transmembrane domain. Continuum
electrostatics calculations are used to assess the change in the barrier height
of the hydrophobic gate as a function of pore expansion. The results suggest
that an increase in radius of Delta r ~ 1.5 angstrom is sufficient to
functionally open the pore without, for example, a requirement for rotation of
the M2 helices. This is evaluated in the context of current mutational and
structural data on the nAChR and its homologues.

Function (VDF) were recorded in the course of low-frequency discharge current

thruster. The evolution in time of the ion axial velocity component is
monitored by means of a laser induced fluorescence diagnostic tool with a time
resolution of 100 ns. As the number of fluorescence photons is very low during
such a short time period, a hom-made pulse-counting lock-in system was used to
perform real-time discrimination between background photons and fluorescence
photons. The evolution in time of the ion VDF was observed at three locations
along the thruster channel axis after a fast shut down of the thruster power.
The anode discharge current is switched off at 2 kHz during 5 $\mu$s without
any synchronization with the current oscillation cycle. This approach allows to
examine the temporal behavior of the ion VDF during decay and ignition of the
discharge as well as during forced and natural plasma oscillations.
Measurements show that the distribution function of the axial component of the
Xe$^+$ ion does change periodically in time with a frequency close to the
current oscillation frequency in both forced and natural cases. The ion density
and the mean velocity are found to oscillate whereas the velocity dispersion
stays constant, which indicates that ionization and acceleration layers have
identical dynamics. Finally, variations over time of the electric field are for
the first time experimentally evidenced in a crossed-field discharge.

14-23 arcsecond resolution toward the Orion Bar in the SO 8_8-9_9, H2CO

pattern. The C2H emission peaks close to the ionization front, followed by H2CO
and SO, while C18O, HCN and 13CO peak deeper into the cloud. A simple PDR model
reproduces the observed stratification, although the SO emission is predicted
to peak much deeper into the cloud than observed while H2CO is predicted to
peak closer to the ionization front than observed. In addition, the predicted
SO abundance is higher than observed while the H2CO abundance is lower than
observed. The discrepancies between the models and observations indicate that
more sophisticated models, including production of H2CO through grain surface
chemistry, are needed to quantitatively match the observations of this region.

light curve is marginally consistent with the 56Ni heating model, although the

types of SNe. It showed many intermediate width (~2000 km/s FWHM) emission
lines, e.g., [Fe II], [Ca II], and Ca II. The absence of the broad [O I] 6300,
6364 line and weakness of [Fe II] and [Ca II] lines compared with Ca II IR
triplet would be explained by a moderately high electron density in the line
emitting region. This high density assumption seems to be consistent with the
large amount of ejecta and low expansion velocity of SN 2006gy. The H-alpha
line luminosity was as small as ~1x10^39 erg/s, being comparable with those of
normal Type II SNe at similar epochs. Our observation indicates that the strong
CSM interaction had almost finished by ~400 days. If the late time optical flux
is purely powered by radioactive decay, at least M_Ni ~ 3 M_sun should be
produced at the SN explosion. In the late phase spectrum, there were several

line shape at resonances. We apply the general formalism to the nonequilibrium
anisotropic Kondo model at finite magnetic field. We consider the weak-coupling
regime, where the maximum of voltage and bare magnetic field is larger than the
Kondo-temperature. In this regime, we calculate the nonlinear conductance, the
magnetic susceptibility, the renormalized spin relaxation and dephasing rates,
and the renormalized g-factor. All quantities are considered up to the first
logarithmic contributions at resonance. Up to a redefinition of the Kondo
temperature, we confirm previous results for the conductance and the magnetic
susceptibility in the isotropic case. In addition, we present a consistent
calculation of the line shape at the resonances, including the determination
which rate cuts off the logarithmic divergence. Furthermore, we calculate the
rates and the renormalized g-factor in nonequilibrium beyond leading order,
being quantities characterizing the exponential decay of the time evolution of
the magnetization. For all quantities we analyse also the anisotropic case and
find interesting nonequilibrium effects at resonance.

quantum system with discrete states coupled in an arbitrary way (i.e. not
necessarily linear) to several infinitely large particle or heat reservoirs.
For both bosonic or fermionic reservoirs we develop a quantum field-theoretical
diagrammatic formulation in Liouville space by expanding systematically in the
reservoir-system coupling and integrating out the reservoir degrees of freedom.
As a result we obtain a kinetic equation for the reduced density matrix of the
quantum system. Based on this formalism, we present a formally exact
perturbative renormalization group (RG) method from which the kernel of this
kinetic equation can be calculated. It is demonstrated how the nonequilibrium
stationary state (induced by several reservoirs kept at different chemical
potentials or temperatures), arbitrary observables such as the transport
current, and the time evolution into the stationary state can be calculated.
Most importantly, we show how RG equations for the relaxation and dephasing
rates can be derived and how they cut off generically the RG flow of the
vertices. The method is based on a previously derived real-time RG technique
but formulated here in Laplace space and generalized to arbitrary
reservoir-system couplings. Furthermore, for fermionic reservoirs with flat
density of states, we make use of a recently introduced cutoff scheme on the
imaginary frequency axis which has several technical advantages. We demonstrate
the method by applying it to the nonequilibrium isotropic Kondo model in
1-loop. We present a systematic way to solve the RG equations analytically in
the weak-coupling limit and provide an outlook of the applicability to the
strong-coupling case.

problem in colloid physics and becomes a central topic in the study of
biological systems where the electrostatic interaction between proteins,
nucleic acids, membranes is involved. This problem is often described starting
from the simple one-dimensional model of two parallel charged plates. Several
different approaches to this problem exist, focusing on different features. In
many cases, an intuitive expression of the pressure exerted on the plates is
proposed, which includes an electrostatic plus an osmotic contribution. We
present an explicit and self-consistent derivation of this formula for the
general case of any charge densities on the plates and any salt solution,
obtained in the framework of the Poisson-Boltzmann theory. We also show that,
depending on external constraints, the correct thermodynamic potential can
differ from the usual PB free energy. The resulting expression predicts, for
asymmetric, oppositely charged plates, the existence of a non trivial
equilibrium position with the plates separated by a finite distance. It is
therefore crucial, in order to study the kinetic stability of the corresponding
energy minimum, to obtain its explicit dependence on the plates charge
densities and on the ion concentration. An analytic expression for the position
and value of the corresponding energy minimum has been derived in 1975 by
Ohshima [Ohshima H., Colloid and Polymer Sci. 253, 150-157 (1975)] but,
surprisingly, this important result seems to be overlooked today. We retrieve
the expressions obtained by Ohshima in a simpler formalism, more familiar to
the physics community, and give a physical interpretation of the observed
behavior.
