taking a continuum limit of Denef et al's multi-center solutions provides a

undecidable if it is restricted to strategies with (unbounded) finite memory.
However, if mixed strategies are allowed, decidability remains an open problem.
One way to obtain a provably decidable variant of the problem is restricting
the strategies to be positional or stationary. For the complexity of these two

to the action of the isotropy group of homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes

a generic spacetime. Using the Hamiltonian formalism for gravitating perfect
fluids, we obtain a set of equations for the evolution of the effective
variables; these equations incorporate the effects of backreaction by the
inhomogeneities. Specializing to dust-filled spacetimes, we find regimes that
lead to a closed set of backreaction equations, which we solve for small
inhomogeneities. We then study the case of large inhomogeneities in relation to
the proposal that backreaction can lead to accelerated expansion. In
particular, we identify regions of the gravitational state space that
correspond to effective cosmic acceleration. Necessary conditions are (i) a
strong expansion of the congruences corresponding to comoving observers, and
(ii) a large negative value of a dissipation variable that appears in the
effective equations (i.e, an effective ""anti-dissipation"").

based on Cherenkov light measurements, e.g. in the Imaging Air Cherenkov
Telescopes (IACT). IACT's are commonly and successfully used in order to search
and study Very High Energy (VHE) gamma-ray sources. Difficulties with
separating primary photons from primary hadrons (mostly protons) in Cherenkov
experiments become larger at lower energies. I have calculated longitudinal and
lateral density distributions and their fluctuations at low energies basing on
Monte Carlo simulations (for vertical gamma cascades and protonic showers) to
check the influence of the detector parameters on the possible measurement.
Relative density fluctuations are significantly higher in proton than in photon
induced showers. Taking into account the limited detector field of view (FOV)
implies the changes of these calculated distributions for both types of primary
particles and causes an enlargement in relative fluctuations. Absorption due to
Rayleigh and Mie scattering has an impact on mean values but does not change
relative fluctuations. The total number of Cherenkov photons is more sensitive
to the observation height in gamma cascades than in proton showers at low
primary energies. The relative fluctuations of the density do not depend on the
reflector size in the investigated size range (from 240 m^2 up to 960 m^2).
This implies that a single telescope with a mirror area larger than that of the
MAGIC telescope cannot achieve better energy resolution than estimated and
presented in this paper. The correlations between longitudinal and lateral
distributions are much more pronounced for primary gamma-ray than for primary
proton showers.

one to probe two-particle properties (susceptibilities) and collective
excitations by standard experimental tunneling methods. We demonstrate this
theoretically, using a novel many-body calculation for the multi-center Kondo
problem, including both direct and indirect exchange between magnetic atoms. An
example of the two-particle correlations around a single magnetic adatom in the
Kondo regime, as would be viewed by a scanning tunneling microscope, is given.
The spatial dependance of the charge and spin correlations, including the
formation of the Kondo cloud in the spin sector, are shown.

bird and plane. Whereas birds use this technique mainly for foraging, humans do
it as a sporting activity. Thermalling involves efficient optimization

fields applied parallel to trilayers consisting of a low-T Nb interlayer and
two outer Ni Fe layers having in-plane anisotropy. At low magnetic fields these
trilayers exhibit a pronounced magnetoresistance effect. Its dynamic transport
behavior is presented through detailed I-V characteristics. More importantly,
the detailed evolution of the longitudinal and transverse magnetic components
of the trilayers is presented from close to well below T . These data clearly
show that below T and for low magnetic fields the transport properties of the
Nb interlayer are influenced by transverse stray-fields that motivate
subsequent transverse magnetic coupling of the outer Ni Fe layers. By
generalizing this experimental finding we propose that the generic prerequisite
for the occurrence of intense magnetoresistance effects in relative trilayers
is that the coercive fields of the outer ferromagnetic layers should almost
coincide since the simultaneous occurrence of magnetic domains all over their
surface will promote a transverse magnetic coupling mediated by the
accompanying transverse stray fields. Finally, the trilayer's upper-critical
field exhibits a pronounced suppression for low magnetic fields indicative of a
behavior, while for high values the conventional behavior is recovered. A
similar process is observed in both Nb-Ni Fe bilayers and Nb single layers.
However, significant qualitative and quantitative differences exist between
these samples. Based on a mechanism that is motivated by longitudinal
stray-fields existing exclusively in the high-field regime we propose a
possible interpretation for this experimental finding.

experimentations have provided promising detection rates, in particular for
script files (89%), with almost none false positives. In the case of process

Bose-Einstein condensate. This model describes a mixture of two species of
atoms in different proportions, which can combine to form a triatomic molecule.
Beginning with a classical analysis, we determine the fixed points of the
system. Bifurcations of these points separate the parameter space into
different regions. Three distinct scenarios are found, varying with the atomic
population imbalance. This result suggests the ground-state properties of the
quantum model exhibit a sensitivity on the atomic population imbalance, which
is confirmed by a quantum analysis using different approaches, such as the
ground-state expectation values, the behavior of the quantum dynamics, the
energy gap, and the ground-state fidelity.

responsible for the burst. Similar, though somewhat shorter, tails are seen in

Multiple Access (SDMA) systems with bursty traffic, where zero-forcing
beamforming enables simultaneous transmission to multiple mobiles. Computing
beamforming vectors relies on quantized channel state information (CSI)
feedback (limited feedback) from mobiles. Define the stability region for SDMA
as the set of multiuser packet-arrival rates for which the steady-state queue
lengths are finite. Given perfect CSI feedback and equal power allocation over
scheduled queues, the stability region is proved to be a convex polytope having
the derived vertices. For any set of arrival rates in the stability region,
multiuser queues are shown to be stabilized by a joint queue-and-beamforming
control policy that maximizes the departure-rate-weighted sum of queue lengths.
The stability region for limited feedback is found to be the perfect-CSI region
multiplied by one minus a small factor. The required number of feedback bits
per mobile is proved to scale logarithmically with the inverse of the above
factor as well as linearly with the number of transmit antennas minus one. The
effects of limited feedback on queueing delay are also quantified. For Poisson
arrival processes, CSI quantization errors are shown to multiply average
queueing delay by a factor larger than one. This factor can be controlled by
adjusting the number of feedback bits per mobile following the derived
relationship. For general arrival processes, CSI errors are found to increase
Kingman's bound on the tail probability of the instantaneous delay by one plus
a small factor. The required number of feedback bits per mobile is shown to
scale logarithmically with this factor.

the evolution timescale of circumstellar debris discs, and the physical
mechanisms responsible for such evolution around solar-type stars. In addition,
we perform a detailed characterisation of the detected debris discs.
Theoretically, the mass of the disc is expected to decrease with time. In order
to test this hypothesis, we performed the generalised Kendall's tau correlation
and three different two-sample tests. A characterisation of the detected debris
discs has been obtained by computing the collision and Poynting-Robertson
timescales and by modelling the spectral energy distribution. The Kendall's tau
correlation yields a probability of 76% that the mass of debris discs and their
age are correlated. Similarly, the three two-sample tests give a probability
between 70 and 83% that younger and older debris systems belong to different
parent populations in terms of dust mass. We detected submillimetre/millimetre
emission from six debris discs, enabling a detailed SED modelling. Our results
on the correlation and evolution of dust mass as a function of age are
conditioned by the sensitivity limit of our survey. Deeper millimetre
observations are needed to confirm the evolution of debris material around
solar-like stars. In the case of the detected discs, the comparison between
collision and Poynting-Robertson timescales supports the hypothesis that these
discs are collision dominated. All detected debris disc systems show the inner
part evacuated from small micron-sized grains.

barrier becomes lower and is eventually replaced by a flat inflection point,
around which the remaining branes easily inflate. This dynamical flattening of

also leads to successful inflation for a larger range of inflaton initial

parametrize the phase curves by a linear-exponential model (Kaasalainen et al.,

amplitude A and the Half-Width at Half-Maximum (HWHM) of the opposition surge,
and the slope S of the linear part of the phase function at larger phase
angles. Our analysis demonstrates that all of these morphological parameters
are correlated with the single scattering albedos of the surfaces. By taking
more accurately into consideration the finite angular size of the Sun, we find
that the Galilean, Saturnian, Uranian and Neptunian satellites have similar
HWHMs (0.5 degrees), whereas they have a wide range of amplitudes A. The Moon
has the largest HWHM (2 degrees). We interpret that as a consequence of the
solar size bias, via the finite size of the Sun which varies dramatically from
the Earth to Neptune. By applying a new method that attempts to morphologically
deconvolve the phase function to the solar angular size, we find that icy and
young surfaces, with active resurfacing, have the smallest values of A and
HWHM, whereas dark objects (and perhaps older surfaces) such as the Moon,

Unlike submodular minimization, submodular maximization is NP-hard. For the

Vondr\'ak recently developed a $2\over 5$-approximation algorithm \cite{FMV07},

give the first constant-factor approximation algorithm for maximizing any

Observational evidence for a local excess of high-energy positrons has
motivated recent models with an additional interaction between dark matter
particles that can result in a Sommerfeld enhancement to the cross section for
annihilation. In such models, the cross section becomes velocity-dependent and
may enhance the dark matter annihilation rate in the solar neighborhood
relative to the rate in the early universe sufficiently to source observed
fluxes of high-energy positrons. We demonstrate that, for particle interaction
cross sections that increase with decreasing velocity, the kinematical
structures of dark matter halos with interior density profiles shallower than
isothermal, such as Navarro-Frenk-White or Einasto halos, may induce a further
enhancement owing to the position-dependent velocity distribution. We provide
specific examples for the increase in the annihilation rate with a cross
section enhanced by the Sommerfeld effect. In dark matter halos like that of
the Milky Way and Local Group dwarf galaxies, the effective cross section at
the halo center can be significantly larger than its local value. The
additional enhancement owing to halo kinematics depends upon the parameters of
any model, but is a prediction of certain models aimed at explaining measured
positron fluxes and can exceed an order of magnitude.

Mpc and slope gamma=1.66 +/-0.22. X-ray AGN have a similar clustering amplitude
as red, quiescent and `green' transition galaxies at z~1 and are significantly
more clustered than blue, star-forming galaxies. The X-ray AGN clustering
strength is primarily determined by the host galaxy color; AGN in red host
galaxies are significantly more clustered than AGN in blue host galaxies, with
a relative bias that is similar to that of red to blue DEEP2 galaxies. We
detect no dependence of clustering on optical brightness, X-ray luminosity, or
hardness ratio within the ranges probed here. We find evidence for galaxies
hosting X-ray AGN to be more clustered than a sample of galaxies with matching
joint optical color and magnitude distributions. This implies that galaxies
hosting X-ray AGN are more likely to reside in groups and more massive dark
matter halos than galaxies of the same color and luminosity without an X-ray
AGN. In comparison to optically-selected quasars in the DEEP2 fields, we find
that X-ray AGN at z~1 are more clustered than optically-selected quasars (with
a 2.6-sigma significance) and therefore likely reside in more massive dark
matter halos. Our results are consistent with galaxies undergoing a quasar
phase while in the blue cloud before settling on the red sequence with a
lower-luminosity X-ray AGN, if they are similar objects at different
evolutionary stages.

resolution of approx. 2 mas. To extract the astrometric data from our
spectrally dispersed AMBER data, we employed a new algorithm, which fits the
wavelength-differential visibility and closure phase modulations along the H-

changing atmospheric conditions. Our new astrometric measurements show that the
companion has nearly completed one orbital revolution since its discovery in
1997. The derived orbital elements imply a short-period (P=11.3 yrs) and
high-eccentricity orbit (e=0.6) with periastron passage around 2002.6. The new
orbit is consistent with recently published radial velocity measurements, from
which we can also derive the first direct constraints on the mass ratio of the

extracted from field correlation functions. This makes it possible to study
quantum kinks in a fully non-perturbative way using Monte Carlo simulations. We
demonstrate this by calculating the kink mass as well as the spectrum and
approximate wave functions of its excitations. This way of measuring the kink
mass has clear advantages over the existing approaches based on creation and
annihilation operators or the kink free energy. Our methods are straightforward
to generalise to more realistic theories and other defect types.

three phases: search, characterization, and evaluation. The evaluation of the
detection - determining whether a candidate event is astrophysical in origin or
some artifact created by instrument noise - is a crucial step in the analysis.
The on-going analyses of data from ground based detectors employ a frequentist
approach to the detection problem. A detection statistic is chosen, for which
background levels and detection efficiencies are estimated from Monte Carlo
studies. This approach frames the detection problem in terms of an infinite
collection of trials, with the actual measurement corresponding to some
realization of this hypothetical set. Here we explore an alternative, Bayesian
approach to the detection problem, that considers prior information and the
actual data in hand. Our particular focus is on the computational techniques
used to implement the Bayesian analysis. We find that the Parallel Tempered
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (PTMCMC) algorithm is able to address all three phases
of the anaylsis in a coherent framework. The signals are found by locating the
posterior modes, the model parameters are characterized by mapping out the
joint posterior distribution, and finally, the model evidence is computed by
thermodynamic integration. As a demonstration, we consider the detection
problem of selecting between models describing the data as instrument noise, or
instrument noise plus the signal from a single compact galactic binary. The
evidence ratios, or Bayes factors, computed by the PTMCMC algorithm are found
to be in close agreement with those computed using a Reversible Jump Markov
Chain Monte Carlo algorithm.

In the simulations of jet evolution, a small-scale equilibrium magnetic arcade
is twisted by a differentially rotating accretion disk. These simulations
produce a collimated outflow which is unstable to the current driven m=1 kink
mode for low rotational velocities of the accretion disk relative to the Alfven
speed of the coronal plasma. The growth rate of the kink mode in the jet is
shown to be inversely related to the rotation rate of the disk, and the jet is
stable for high rotation rates. Linear MHD calculations investigate the effect
of rigid rotation on the kink mode in a cylindrical plasma. These calculations
show that the Coriolis force distorts the m=1 kink eigenmode and stabilizes it
at rotation frequencies such that the rotation period is longer than a few

confirming the previous results. (3) The distribution of power spectrum
estimators at BAO scales, among the realizations, is well approximated by a
Gaussian distribution with variance that is given by the diagonal covariance

non-Gaussian errors is mitigated due to nonlinear redshift distortions. (5) For
an actual galaxy survey, the additional shot noise contamination compromises
the cosmological information inherent in the galaxy power spectrum, but also
mitigates the impact of non-Gaussian errors. The S/N is degraded by up to 30%

DGLAP evolution equation for the proton structure function $F_2^{\gamma

heavy-quark masses. We derive the equation for $G(x,Q^2)$ in two different
ways, first using our original differential-equation method, and then using a
new method based on Laplace transforms. The results do not require the use of
the gluon evolution equation, or, to good approximation, knowledge of the
individual quark distributions. Given an analytic expression that successfully
reproduces the known experimental data for $F_2^{\gamma p}(x,Q^2)$ in a domain
${\cal D}(x,Q^2)$--where $x_{\rm min}(Q^2) \le x \le x_{\rm max}(Q^2)$,
$Q^2_{\rm min}\le Q^2\le Q^2_{\rm max}$ of the Bjorken variable $x$ and the
virtuality $Q^2$--$G(x,Q^2)$ is uniquely determined in the same domain. As an
application of the method, we construct a new global parametrization of the
complete set of ZEUS data on $F_2^{\gamma p}(x,Q^2)$, and use this to determine
the 5 quark gluon distribution, $G(x,Q^2)$, for massless $u, d, s$ and massive
$c, b$ quarks and discuss the mass effects evident in the result. We compare
these results to the gluon distributions for CTEQ6L, and in the domain ${\cal
D}(x,Q^2)$ where they should agree, they do not; the discrepancy is due to the
fact that the CTEQ6L results do not give an accurate description of the ZEUS
$F_2^{\gamma p}(x,Q^2)$ experimental data. We emphasize that our method for
obtaining the LO gluon distribution connects $G(x,Q^2)$ {\em directly} to the
proton structure function without either the need for individual parton

Millennium Run. Our initial conditions include well resolved compound galaxy
models consisting of dark matter halos and stellar bulges that are used to
replace the most massive cluster progenitor halos at redshift z=3. By
construction, our galaxy models obey the stellar mass-size relation initially.
We demonstrate that the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) evolves away from the
Kormendy relation as defined by the smaller mass galaxies (i.e., the relation
bends). As a result of the comparatively large number of mergers the BCG
experiences, its total mass-to-light ratio becomes significantly higher than in
typical elliptical galaxies. We also show that the mixing processes between
dark matter and stars lead to a small but numerically robust tilt in the
fundamental plane and that the BCG lies on the tilted plane. Our model is
consistent with the observed steepening of the logarithmic mass-to-light
gradient as a function of the stellar mass. Surprisingly, we find only
tentative weak distortion in the Faber-Jackson relation that depends on the
aperture size, unlike expected based on studies of isolated merger simulations.
This may be due to differences in the distribution of galaxy orbits, which is
given in our approach directly by the cosmological context while it has to be
assumed in isolated merger simulations, and the fact that the BCG is located
deep in the cluster potential well.

can naturally explain this anomaly. If the nearest major CR source is about a
kpc away, then low energy electrons ($\sim 1$ GeV) can easily reach us. At
higher energies ($\gtrsim 10$ GeV), the source electrons cool via synchrotron
and inverse-Compton before reaching Earth. Pairs formed in the local vicinity
through the proton/ISM interactions can reach Earth also at high energies, thus
increasing the positron/electron ratio. A natural origin of source
inhomogeneity is the strong concentration of supernovae in the galactic spiral
arms. Assuming supernova remnants (SNRs) as the sole primary source of CRs, and
taking into account their concentration near the galactic spiral arms, we
consistently recover the observed positron fraction between 1 and 100 GeV.
ATIC's electron excess at $\sim 600$ GeV is explained, in this picture, as the
contribution of a few known nearby SNRs. The apparent coincident similarity
between the cooling time of electrons at 10 GeV (where the positron/electron
ratio upturn), $\sim 10$ Myr, and the CRs protons cosmogenic age at the same

games with repeated selfish behavior of self-interested agents. Sink equilibria
has been introduced by Goemans, Mirrokni, and Vetta for studying social cost on
Nash dynamics over pure strategies in games. However, they do not address the
complexity of sink equilibria in these games. Recently, Fabrikant and
Papadimitriou initiated the study of the complexity of Nash dynamics in two
classes of games. In order to completely understand the complexity of Nash
dynamics in a variety of games, we study the following three questions for
various games: (i) given a state in game, can we verify if this state is in a
sink equilibrium or not? (ii) given an instance of a game, can we verify if
there exists any sink equilibrium other than pure Nash equilibria? and (iii)
given an instance of a game, can we verify if there exists a pure Nash
equilibrium (i.e, a sink equilibrium with one state)?
  In this paper, we almost answer all of the above questions for a variety of
classes of games with succinct representation, including anonymous games,
player-specific and weighted congestion games, valid-utility games, and
two-sided market games. In particular, for most of these problems, we show that
(i) it is PSPACE-complete to verify if a given state is in a sink equilibrium,
(ii) it is NP-hard to verify if there exists a pure Nash equilibrium in the
game or not, (iii) it is PSPACE-complete to verify if there exists any sink
equilibrium other than pure Nash equilibria. To solve these problems, we
illustrate general techniques that could be used to answer similar questions in
other classes of games.

Function (IMF) is universal. Our observations of HI selected galaxies in the
light of H-alpha and the far-ultraviolet (FUV) challenge this notion. The flux
ratio H-alpha/FUV from these two star formation tracers shows strong
correlations with the surface-brightness in H-alpha and the R band: Low Surface
Brightness (LSB) galaxies have lower ratios compared to High Surface Brightness
galaxies and to expectations from equilibrium star formation models using
commonly favored IMF parameters. Weaker but significant correlations of
H-alpha/FUV with luminosity, rotational velocity and dynamical mass are found
as well as a systematic trend with morphology. The correlated variations of
H-alpha/FUV with other global parameters are thus part of the larger family of
galaxy scaling relations. The H-alpha/FUV correlations can not be due to dust
correction errors, while systematic variations in the star formation history
can not explain the trends with both H-alpha and R surface brightness. LSB
galaxies are unlikely to have a higher escape fraction of ionizing photons
considering their high gas fraction, and color-magnitude diagrams. The most
plausible explanation for the correlations are systematic variations of the
upper mass limit and/or slope of the IMF at the upper end. We outline a
scenario of pressure driving the correlations by setting the efficiency of the
formation of the dense star clusters where the highest mass stars form. Our
results imply that the star formation rate measured in a galaxy is highly
sensitive to the tracer used in the measurement. A non-universal IMF also calls
into question the interpretation of metal abundance patterns in dwarf galaxies
and star formation histories derived from color magnitude diagrams. Abridged.

inside a galactic bulge, similar to that of our Galaxy or M31. We assume that
the dynamical and thermal properties of the hot gas are dominated by mechanical
energy input from SNe, primarily Type Ia, and mass injection from evolved stars

the SN heating on scales down to ~4 pc. An embedding scheme that is devised to
plant individual SNR seeds, allows to examine, for the first time, the effect
of sporadic SNe on the density, temperature, and iron ejecta distribution of
the hot gas as well as the resultant X-ray morphology and spectrum. We find
that the SNe produce a bulge wind with highly filamentary density structures
and patchy ejecta. Compared with a 1D spherical wind model, the non-uniformity
of simulated gas density, temperature, and metallicity substantially alters the
spectral shape and increases the diffuse X-ray luminosity. The differential
emission measure as a function of temperature of the simulated gas exhibits a
log-normal distribution, with a peak value much lower than that of the
corresponding 1D model. The bulk of the X-ray emission comes from the
relatively low temperature and low abundance gas shells associated with SN
blastwaves. SN ejecta are not well mixed with the ambient medium, at least in
the bulge region. These results, at least partly, account for the apparent lack

cause in an originally quiescent fluid. We employ the Eulerian-Lagrangian
method with two-way coupling and periodic boundary conditions. In order to be
able to treat up to 288000 bubbles, the following approximations and
simplifications had to be introduced: (i) The bubbles were treated as
point-particles, thus (ii) disregarding the near-field interactions among them,
and (iii) effective force models for the lift and the drag forces were used. In
particular, the lift coefficient was assumed to be 1/2, independent of the
bubble Reynolds number and the local flow field. The results suggest that large
scale motions are generated, owing to an inverse energy cascade from the small
to the large scales. However, as the Taylor-Reynolds number is only in the
range of 1, the corresponding scaling of the energy spectrum with an exponent
of -5/3 cannot develop over a pronounced range. In the long term, the property
of local energy transfer, characteristic of real turbulence, is lost and the
input of energy equals the viscous dissipation at all scales. Due to the lack
of strong vortices the bubbles spread rather uniformly in the flow. The
mechanism for uniform spreading is as follows: Rising bubbles induce a velocity
field behind them that acts on the following bubbles. Owing to the shear, those
bubbles experience a lift force which make them spread to the left or right,
thus preventing the formation of vertical bubble clusters and therefore of
efficient forcing. Indeed, when the lift is artifically put to zero in the
simulations, the flow is forced much more efficiently and a more pronounced
energy accumulates at large scales is achieved.

main minimum-problem of the theory of interior capacities of condensers in a

interesting to find statements of variational problems dual to the main

capacity), but always solvable (e.g., even for nonclosed condensers). For all
positive definite kernels satisfying B. Fuglede's condition of consistency
between the strong and vague topologies, problems with the desired properties
are posed and solved. Their solutions provide a natural generalization of the
well-known notion of interior capacitary distributions associated with a set.
We give a description of those solutions, establish statements on their

observed cooperative transport process using a stochastic model that describes
the dynamics of two molecular motors, an active one that moves cargo
unidirectionally along a filament track and a passive one that acts as a
tether. Analytical expressions obtained from our analysis are fit to
experimental data to estimate the microscopic kinetic parameters of our model.
Our analysis reveals two qualitatively distinct processivity-enhancing
mechanisms: the passive tether can decrease the typical detachment rate of the
active motor from the filament track or it can increase the corresponding
reattachment rate. Our estimates unambiguously show that in the case of
microtubular transport, a higher average run length arises mainly from the
ability of the passive motor to keep the cargo close to the filament, enhancing
the reattachment rate of an active kinesin motor that has recently detached.
Instead, for myosin-driven transport along actin, the passive motor tightly
tethers the cargo to the filament, suppressing the detachment rate of the
active myosin.

necessary (but not sufficient) for a 1 solar mass star to become a red giant,
this is not the case in a star of 5 solar masses. It therefore seems that there
may be more than one way to make a giant.

inspiral and merger of black hole (BH)-neutron star (NS) binaries are

conditions, BH-NS binaries in a quasiequilibrium state are prepared in a
modified version of the moving-puncture approach. The BH is modeled by a
nonspinning moving puncture and for the NS, a polytropic equation of state with
$\Gamma=2$ and the irrotational velocity field are employed. The mass ratio of
the BH to the NS, $Q=M_{\rm BH}/M_{\rm NS}$, is chosen in the range between 1.5
and 5. The compactness of the NS, defined by ${\cal C}=GM_{\rm NS}/c^2R_{\rm
NS}$, is chosen to be between 0.145 and 0.178. For a large value of $Q$ for
which the NS is not tidally disrupted and is simply swallowed by the BH,
gravitational waves are characterized by inspiral, merger, and ringdown
waveforms. In this case, the waveforms are qualitatively the same as that from
BH-BH binaries. For a sufficiently small value of $Q \alt 2$, the NS may be
tidally disrupted before it is swallowed by the BH. In this case, the amplitude
of the merger and ringdown waveforms is very low, and thus, gravitational waves
are characterized by the inspiral waveform and subsequent quick damping. The
difference in the merger and ringdown waveforms is clearly reflected in the
spectrum shape and in the ""cut-off"" frequency above which the spectrum
amplitude steeply decreases. When an NS is not tidally disrupted (e.g., for
Q=5), kick velocity, induced by asymmetric gravitational wave emission, agrees
approximately with that derived for the merger of BH-BH binaries, whereas for
the case that the tidal disruption occurs, the kick velocity is significantly
suppressed.

solves the stochastic differential equation describing the model, rather than
the equivalent master equation. This has the advantages of allowing more
efficient numerical solution, the modelling of time-dependent situations, and
investigation of details of event statistics. The Monte-Carlo approach is
illustrated by application to a Gaussian test case, and to the class of
flare-like models presented in Wheatland (2008), which are steady-state models
with constant rates of energy supply, and power-law distributed jump transition
rates. These models have two free parameters: an index ($\delta $), which
defines the dependence of the jump transition rates on active-region energy,
and a non-dimensional ratio ($\overline{r})$ of total flaring rate to rate of
energy supply. For $\overline{r}\ll 1$ the non-dimensional mean energy
$<\overline{E}>$ of the active-region satisfies $<\overline{E}> \gg 1$,
resulting in a power-law distribution of flare events over many decades in
energy. The Monte-Carlo method is used to explore the behavior of the
waiting-time distributions for the flare-like models. The models with
$\delta\neq 0$ are found to have waiting times which depart significantly from
simple Poisson behavior when $<\overline{E}> \gg 1$. The original model from
Wheatland and Glukhov (1998), with $\delta=0$ (no dependence of transition
rates on active-region energy), is identified as being most consistent with
observed flare statistics.

separation of 5.7"", corresponding to 800 AU at the distance of Taurus. To
assess the nature of these two objects, we have obtained spectra of them and
have constructed their spectral energy distributions. Both sources are young
(~1 Myr) according to their Halpha emission, gravity-sensitive spectral
features, and mid-IR excess emission. The proper motion of FU Tau A provides
additional evidence of its membership in Taurus. We measure spectral types of
M7.25 and M9.25 for FU Tau A and B, respectively, which correspond to masses of
~0.05 and ~0.015 M\cdot according to the evolutionary models of Chabrier and
Baraffe. FU Tau A is significantly overluminous relative to an isochrone
passing through FU Tau B and relative to other members of Taurus near its
spectral type, which may indicate that it is an unresolved binary. FU Tau A and
B are likely to be components of a binary system based on the low probability
(~3x10^-4) that Taurus would produce two unrelated brown dwarfs with a
projected separation of a </- 6"". Barnard 215 contains only one other young
star and is in a remote area of Taurus, making FU Tau A and B the first
spectroscopically-confirmed brown dwarfs discovered forming in isolation rather
than in a stellar cluster or aggregate. Because they were born in isolation and
comprise a weakly bound binary, dynamical interactions with stars could not
have played a role in their formation, and thus are not essential for the birth
of brown dwarfs. ERRATUM: The K-band magnitude for FU Tau B in Table 1 is
incorrect and should be 13.33. The bolometric luminosity of FU Tau B in Table 3
and Figure 5 is incorrect because of that mistake and a separate arithmetic
error. The correct value of the luminosity is 0.0039 Lsun. FU Tau A and B
exhibited different isochronal ages in the original Hertzsprung-Russell diagram
in Figure 5, which was unexpected for members of a binary system. This
discrepancy is reduced in the corrected version of Figure 5 since both objects
are now above the isochrone for 1 Myr. Given the large uncertainties in model
isochrones at such young ages, the positions of FU Tau A and B in Figure 5
could be roughly consistent with coevality.

cosmological information. Precision cosmological probes targeted primarily at
investigations of dark energy require accurate theoretical determinations of
the power spectrum in the nonlinear regime. To exploit the observational power
of future cosmological surveys, accuracy demands on the theory are at the one
percent level or better. Numerical simulations are currently the only way to
produce sufficiently error-controlled predictions for the power spectrum. The
very high computational cost of (precision) N-body simulations is a major
obstacle to obtaining predictions in the nonlinear regime, while scanning over
cosmological parameters. Near-future observations, however, are likely to
provide a meaningful constraint only on constant dark energy equation of state
'wCDM' cosmologies. In this paper we demonstrate that a limited set of only 37
cosmological models -- the ""Coyote Universe"" suite -- can be used to predict
the nonlinear matter power spectrum at the required accuracy over a prior
parameter range set by cosmic microwave background observations. This paper is
the second in a series of three, with the final aim to provide a high-accuracy
prediction scheme for the nonlinear matter power spectrum for wCDM cosmologies.

axiomatic definition of a theory of singular Bott-Chern classes, study their

theory defined by Bismut, Gillet and Soule as the only one that satisfies the
additional condition of being homogeneous. We include a proof of the arithmetic
Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem for closed immersions that generalizes a
result of Bismut, Gillet and Soule and was already proved by Zha. This result
can be combined with the arithmetic Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem for
submersions to extend this theorem to projective morphisms. As a byproduct of
this study we obtain two results of independent interest. First, we prove a
Poincare lemma for the complex of currents with fixed wave front set, and
second we prove that certain direct images of Bott-Chern classes are closed.

show that the values of these physical observables are greatly modified by the
effects of neutral Higgs bosons. In SUSY SO(10) GUT model, the new physics
contribution comes from the operators which are induced by the neutral Higgs
boson penguins and also from the operators with chirality opposite to that of
the corresponding Standard Model (SM) operators. SUSY SO(10) effects show up
only in the decay $B \to K^{\ast}_0 \mu^{+} \mu^{-}$ where the transverse
lepton polarization asymmetries deviate significantly from the SM value while
the effects in the decay rate, forward-backward asymmetries, the longitudinal

polarization asymmetry is almost zero in SM and in MSSM model, whereas it can
reach to -0.3 in SUSY SO(10) GUT model which could be seen at the future
colliders; hence this asymmetry observable can be used to discriminate between

inextendible antichain, which is the analog of a spacelike hypersurface, and a
one parameter family of nerve simplicial complexes is constructed by
""thickening"" this antichain. The associated homology groups can then be
calculated using existing homology software, and their behaviour studied as a
function of the thickening parameter. Earlier analytical work showed that for
an inextendible antichain in a causal set which can be approximated by a
globally hyperbolic spacetime region, there is a one parameter sub-family of
these simplicial complexes which are homological to the continuum, provided the
antichain satisfies certain conditions. Using causal sets that are approximated
by a set of 2d spacetimes our numerical analysis suggests that these conditions
are generically satisfied by inextendible antichains. In both 2d and 3d
simulations, as the thickening parameter is increased, the continuum homology
groups tend to appear as the first region in which the homology is constant, or
""stable"" above the discreteness scale. Below this scale, the homology groups
fluctuate rapidly as a function of the thickening parameter. This provides a
necessary though not sufficient criterion to test for manifoldlikeness of a
causal set.

in the broken symmetry states, including the partial gaps in the spin-density
wave states of parent compounds, and the pairing gaps in the superconducting

pairing lineshape in hole-doped BaFe$_2$As$_2$. Optical phonons at zone center
detected by Raman and infrared techniques are classified for several Fe-based
compounds. Related issues, such as the electron-phonon coupling and the effect
of spin-density wave and superconducting transitions on phonons, are also
discussed. Meanwhile, open questions including the \emph{T}-dependent
mid-infrared peak at 0.6-0.7 eV, electronic correlation, and the
similarities/differences between high-\Tc cuprates and Fe-based superconductors

understood) r-process in the first galactic stars and currently the Ba
abundances in these very metal-poor stars were mostly measured under the Local
Thermodynamical Equilibrium (LTE) assumption, which may lead in general to an
underestimation of Ba. We present here determinations of the barium abundance
taking into account the non-LTE (NLTE) effects in a sample of extremely
metal-poor stars (EMP stars): 6 turnoff stars and 35 giants. The NLTE profiles
of the three unblended Ba II lines (455.4, 585.3, 649.6nm) have been computed.
The computations were made with a modified version of the MULTI code, applied
to an atomic model of the Ba atom with 31 levels of Ba I, 101 levels of Ba II,
and compared to the observations. The ratios of the NLTE abundances of barium
relative to Fe are slightly shifted towards the solar ratio. In the plot of
[Ba/Fe] versus [Fe/H], the slope of the regression line is slightly reduced as
is the scatter. In the interval -3.3 <[Fe/H] < -2.6, [Ba/Fe] decreases with a
slope of about 1.4 and a scatter close to 0.44. For [Fe/H] <-3.3 the number of

that Turing-equivalent models do not support interactive computations. New

ion-molecule reactions and complex molecular spectroscopy at temperatures
between few Kelvin and room temperatures. This article presents a tutorial on
radiofrequency ion trapping in multipole electrode configurations. Stable
trapping conditions and buffer gas cooling, as well as important heating
mechanisms, are discussed. In addition, selected experimental studies on cation

a relatively simple evolution in time of the beryllium abundance and suggests
its use as a time-like observable. We study the evolution of Be in the early
Galaxy and its dependence on kinematic and orbital parameters. We investigate
the formation of the halo and the thick disk of the Galaxy and the use of Be as
a cosmochronometer. Beryllium abundances are determined from high resolution,
high signal to noise UVES spectra with spectrum synthesis in the largest sample
of halo and thick disk stars analyzed to date. We present our observational
results in various diagrams. 1) In a log(Be/H) vs [Fe/H] diagram we find a
marginal statistical detection of a real scatter, above what expected from
measurement errors, with a larger scatter among halo stars. The detection of
the scatter is further supported by the existence of pairs of stars with
identical atmospheric parameters and different Be abundances. 2) In an
log(Be/H) vs [alpha/Fe] diagram, the halo stars separate into two components;
one is consistent with predictions of evolutionary models, while the other has
too high alpha and Be abundances and is chemically indistinguishable from thick
disk stars. This suggests that the halo is not a single uniform population
where a clear age-metallicity relation can be defined. 3) In diagrams of Rmin
vs [alpha/Fe] and log(Be/H) the thick disk stars show a possible decrease of
[alpha/Fe] with Rmin, whereas no dependence of Be with Rmin is seen. This
anticorrelation suggests that the star formation rate was lower in the outer
regions of the thick disc, pointing towards an inside-out formation. The lack
of correlation for Be indicates that it is insensitive to the local conditions
of star formation.

to describe biological reality. It segments the entire biological space-time in
a series of different biological organizations before modeling the property
space of each of these organizations with computational and topological

proved here that the quest for an objective and all-encompassing biological
complexity measure would necessarily end up in failure. Since any study of
biological complexity is rooted in the knowledge of biological reality, an
expression for possible limit of human knowledge about ontological biological
reality, in the form of an uncertainty principle, is proposed here. Two
theorems are proposed to model the fundamental limitation, owing to observer
dependent nature of description of biological reality. They explain the reasons
behind failures to construct a single and complete biological complexity
measure. This model finds support in various experimental results and therefore
provides a reliable and general way to study biological complexity and

collision operator for hard and soft potentials in $n$-dimensions. A
reformulation of the collisional integrals allows us to write the weak form of
the collision operator as a weighted convolution, where the weight is given by
an operator invariant under rotations. Using a symmetrization technique in
$L^p$ we prove a Young's inequality for hard potentials, which is sharp for
Maxwell molecules in the $L^2$ case. Further, we find a new

non-increasing potentials that lie in some $L^{s}_{weak}$ or $L^{s}$. The

weighted convolution inequalities and follows a weak formulation setting.
Consequently, it is closely connected to the classical analysis of Young and
Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequalities. In all cases, the inequality constants
are explicitly given by formulas depending on integrability conditions of the
angular cross section (in the spirit of Grad cut-off). As an additional
application of the technique we also obtain estimates with exponential weights

devices without boundaries, such as tokamaks, stellarators and torsatrons. It
is shown that a perturbed untwisted flow given by a decaying mode magnetic
field is able to generate a slow twisted dynamo plasma flow where the
unperturbed flow is also a steady flow. When the slow dynamo limit is obtained
for high Reynolds magnetic numbers $Rm$, the unperturbed plasma flow achieve

It is shown that the temperature dependence of B_1 and B_2 may be caused by
thermal fluctuations of the polarization, provided the fourth-order
anharmonicity is anomalously small, i. e. the nonlinearity of P^4 type and
higher-order ones play comparable roles. Non-singular (non-critical)
fluctuation contributions to B_1 and B_2 are calculated in the first

perturbations, to be compared with the recent cosmological observations. We
study in detail three different classes of inflationary models, chaotic, hybrid
models and hilltop models, and discuss their embedding into supersymmetric
models and the consequences for model building of the warm inflationary
dynamics based on first principles calculations. Due to the extra friction term
introduced in the inflaton background evolution generated by the dissipative
dynamics, inflation can take place generically for smaller values of the field,
and larger values of couplings and masses. When the dissipative dynamics
dominates over the expansion, in the so-called strong dissipative regime,
inflation proceeds with sub-planckian inflaton values. Models can be naturally
embedded into a supergravity framework, with sugra corrections suppressed by
the Planck mass now under control, for a larger class of K\""ahler potentials.
In particular, this provides a simpler solution to the ""eta"" problem in
supersymmetric hybrid inflation, without restricting the K\""ahler potentials
compatible with inflation. For chaotic models dissipation leads to a smaller
prediction for the tensor-to-scalar ratio and a less tilted spectrum when
compared to the cold inflation scenario. We find in particular that a small
component of dissipation renders the quartic model now consistent with the
current CMB data.

that these LINERs have stopped forming stars long ago. Moreover, their ionizing
radiation field is amazingly consistent with that expected from their old
stellar populations alone. The black-hole in the centers of these massive,
early-type galaxies is not active enough to overwhelm stellar ionization, and
thus, despite their looks, they should not be called AGN.

an optimal auction for procuring multiple units of multiple items when the

satisfying Bayesian incentive compatibility and interim individual rationality.
Under appropriate regularity conditions, this optimal auction also satisfies
dominant strategy incentive compatibility.

arising from colliding wind binaries. The main application is for systems
involving a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star and an OB star companion. The WR wind is
assumed to dominate the forbidden line emission. The colliding wind interaction
is treated as an archimedean spiral with an inner boundary. Under the
assumptions of the model, the major findings are as follows. (a) The
redistribution of the WR wind as a result of the wind collision is not flux
conservative but typically produces an excess of line emission; however, this
excess is modest at around the 10% level. (b) Deviations from a flat-top
profile shape for a spherical wind are greatest for viewing inclinations that
are more nearly face-on to the orbital plane. At intermediate viewing
inclinations, profiles display only mild deviations from a flat-top shape. (c)
The profile shape can be used to constrain the colliding wind bow shock opening
angle. (d) Structure in the line profile tends to be suppressed in binaries of
shorter periods. (e) Obtaining data for multiple forbidden lines is important
since different lines probe different characteristic radial scales. Our models
are discussed in relation to ISO data for WR 147 and gamma Vel (WR11). The
lines for WR 147 are probably not accurate enough to draw firm conclusions. For
gamma Vel, individual line morphologies are broadly reproducible but not
simultaneously so for the claimed wind and orbital parameters. Overall, the
effort demonstrates how lines that are sensitive to the large-scale wind can
help to deduce binary system properties and provide new tests of numerical
simulations.

layered Fe arsenide superconductors at high magnetic fields. Our systematic
magnetotransport measurements of polycrystalline SmFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_x$ at
different doping levels confirm the upward curvature of the upper critical
magnetic field $H_{c2}(T)$ as a function of temperature $T$ defining the phase
boundary between the superconducting and metallic states for crystallites with
the ab planes oriented nearly perpendicular to the magnetic field. We further
show from measurements on single crystals that this feature, which was
interpreted in terms of the existence of two superconducting gaps, is
ubiquitous among both series of single and double layered compounds. In all
compounds explored by us the zero temperature upper critical field $H_{c2}(0)$,
estimated either through the Ginzburg-Landau or the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg
single gap theories, strongly surpasses the weak coupling Pauli paramagnetic
limiting field. This clearly indicates the strong coupling nature of the
superconducting state and the importance of magnetic correlations for these
materials. Our measurements indicate that the superconducting anisotropy, as
estimated through the ratio of the effective masses $\gamma =
(m_c/m_{ab})^{1/2}$ for carriers moving along the c-axis and the ab planes,
respectively, is relatively modest as compared to the high-$T_c$ cuprates, but
it is temperature, field and even doping dependent. Finally, our preliminary
estimations of the irreversibility field $H_m(T)$, separating the vortex-solid
from the vortex-liquid phase in the single layered compounds, indicates that it
is well described by the melting of a vortex lattice in a moderately
anisotropic uniaxial superconductor.
