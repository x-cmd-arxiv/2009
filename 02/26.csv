reddening effects due to galactic halos and large-scale structure. The
measurement is based on correlating the brightness of ~85,000 quasars at z>1
with the position of 20 million galaxies at z~0.3 derived from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey and is used to constrain the galaxy-mass and galaxy-dust
correlation functions up to cosmological scales.
  The presence of dust is detected from 20 kpc to several Mpc, and we find its
projected density to follow: Sigma_dust ~ theta^-0.8, a distribution similar to
mass. The amount of dust in galactic halos is found to be comparable to that in
disks. On large scales its wavelength dependence is described by R_V=3.9+/-2.6,
consistent with interstellar dust. We estimate the resulting opacity of the
Universe as a function of redshift and find A_V~0.03 mag up to z=0.5. This, in
turn, implies a cosmic dust density of Omega_dust ~ 5x10^-6, roughly half of
which comes from dust in halos of ~L* galaxies.
  We present magnification measurements, corrected for dust extinction, from
which the galaxy-mass correlation function is inferred. The mean mass profile
around galaxies is found to be Sigma ~ 30 (theta/arcmin)^-0.8 h M_sun/pc^2 up
to a radius of 10 Mpc, in agreement with gravitational shear estimates.

physical characteristics of a comet. Photometry sets a limit to the effective
radius of the nucleus at r_e < 0.7 km (red geometric albedo 0.05 assumed). The
coma shows a secular fading in our data caused by the escape of dust particles
from the near-nucleus environment. The optical reflection spectrum is a nearly
neutral continuum devoid of gaseous emission lines, from which we derive a
limit to the cyanide (CN) radical production rate of Q_CN <1.4e23/s and infer a
mass loss rate <1.5 kg/s at the time of our observations. Unlike the
first-reported main-belt comets, P/2008 R1 is not dynamically stable. The
nearby 8:3 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter induces dynamical instability on
timescales 20 to 30 Myr. Hence, we conclude that P/2008 R1 has recently arrived
from a more stable source elsewhere. The high Tisserand parameter of the orbit
(in fact, with T_J = 3.216 it is the highest of any comet) points to a source
in the asteroid belt itself, instead of in the Kuiper belt (putative source of
the Jupiter family comets). We infer that P/2008 R1 is an icy body from the
outer asteroid belt in which sublimation has been triggered by rising
temperatures resulting from a decreasing perihelion distance.

wave turbulence are performed to investigate role of whistler waves in solar

characterized typically by the frequency and length scales that are
respectively bigger than ion gyro frequency and smaller than ion gyro radius.
The electron inertial length is an intrinsic length scale in whistler wave
turbulence that distinguishably divides the high frequency solar wind turbulent
spectra into scales smaller and bigger than the electron inertial length. Our
simulations find that the dispersive whistler modes evolve entirely differently
in the two regimes. While the dispersive whistler wave effects are stronger in
the large scale regime, they do not influence the spectral cascades which are
describable by a Kolmogorov-like $k^{-7/3}$ spectrum. By contrast, the small
scale turbulent fluctuations exhibit a Navier-Stokes like evolution where
characteristic turbulent eddies exhibit a typical $k^{-5/3}$ hydrodynamic
turbulent spectrum. By virtue of equipartition between the wave velocity and

  We have performed a comparative analysis between the local and pseudo-global
peak-bagging techniques by fitting the ""limit"" profiles of simulated
helioseismic data. Results show that for asymmetric modes the traditional
fitting technique returns systematically biased estimates of the central
frequency parameter. This bias is significantly reduced when employing the
pseudo-global routine. Similarly, we show that estimates of the background
returned from the pseudo-global routine match the input values much more
closely than the estimates from the local fitting method.

Similar differences between the estimated frequencies returned by the two

alternative to standard general relativity. The Poincar{\'e} group, as a
symmetry group of all relativistic theories in the absence of gravitation,
constitutes the most natural candidate for a gauge group. Although the
Poincar{\'e} gauge theory of gravity has been elaborated over the years and
cast into a beautiful formal framework, some fundamental problems have remained
unsolved. One of them concerns the inclusion of matter. The minimal coupling
procedure, which is employed in standard Yang--Mills theories, appears to be
ambiguous in the case of gravity. We propose a slight modification of this
procedure, which removes the ambiguity. Our modification justifies some earlier
results concerning the consequences of the Poincar{\'e} gauge theory of
gravity. In particular, the predictions of Einstein--Cartan theory with
fermionic matter are rendered unique. We recall the earlier proposed solution
based on modified volume--forms. The advantage of our modification is that the
predictions of the theory are not radically changed. Basically, this
modification simply justifies the results that were obtained partly `by chance'
in the hitherto prevailing accounts on the Einstein--Cartan theory. The only
difference in the predictions, when compared to the standard treatment,
concerns the Proca field in the presence of gravity. The `torsion
singularities' which occur there are shifted towards other values of the field.

subsample of 10 galaxies. The dark matter distribution in each of these
galaxies are calculated using the mass distribution derived from the observed
light distribution and the observed rotation curves. The theoretical
predictions of the onset radii for the warps are then derived by applying a
self-consistent linear response theory to the obtained mass models for 6
galaxies with rotation curves in the literature. By comparing the observed
onset radii to the theoretical ones, we find that discs with constant thickness
can not explain the observations; moderately flaring discs are needed. The
required flaring is consistent with the observations. Our analysis shows that
the onset of warp is not symmetric in our sample of galaxies. We define a new
quantity called the onset-asymmetry index and study its dependence on galaxy
properties. The onset asymmetries in warps tend to be larger in galaxies with
smaller disc scale lengths. We also define and quantify the global asymmetry in
the stellar light distribution, that we call the edge-on asymmetry in edge-on
galaxies. It is shown that in most cases the onset asymmetry in warp is
actually anti-correlated with the measured edge-on asymmetry in our sample of

non-rotating extremal solutions. The nilpotency degree of C is directly related
to the BPS degree of the corresponding solution when they are BPS.
Equivalently, the charges can be described in terms of a Weyl spinor |C > of
Spin*(2N), and then the characteristic equation becomes equivalent to a
generalisation of the Cartan pure spinor constraint on |C>. The invariance of a

`Dirac equation' on the Weyl spinor |C>. We explicitly solve this equation for

the moduli space of asymptotically Taub-NUT black holes with respect with their

bound to each other via strong attractive on-site interaction that exceeds the
inter-site tunneling rate. An ensemble of such lattice-dimers is accurately
described by an effective Hamiltonian of hard core bosons with strong
nearest-neighbor repulsion which is equivalent to the $XXZ$ model with
Ising-like anisotropy. We calculate the ground-state phase diagram for a
one-dimensional system which exhibits incompressible phases, corresponding to
an empty and a fully filled lattice (ferromagnetic phases) and a half-filled
alternating density crystal (anti-ferromagnetic phase), separated from each
other by compressible phases. In a finite lattice the compressible phases show
characteristic oscillatory modulations on top of the anti-ferromagnetic density
profile and in density-density correlations. We derive a kink model which
provides simple quantitative explanation of these features. To describe the
long-range correlations of the system we employ the Luttinger liquid theory
with the relevant Luttinger parameter $K$ obtained exactly using the Bethe
Ansatz solution. We calculate the density-density as well as first-order
correlations and find excellent agreement with numerical results obtained with
density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods. We also present a
perturbative treatment of the system in higher dimensions.

find that the plus component is well behaved and use its spin-flip matrix

of the HI data. Two absorption lines are found toward the southern jet of the
source, one redshifted by 370 +/- 10 km/s and the other blueshifted by 700 +/-
10 km/s with respect to the systemic velocity of the source, which, along with
the results obtained for the opacity distribution over the source, suggests the
presence of two mass clumps rotating around the central region of the source.
We propose a model consisting of a geometrically thick disk, of which we only
see a couple of clumps, that reproduces the velocities measured from the HI
absorption profiles. These clumps rotate in circular Keplerian orbits around an
axis that crosses one of the supermassive black holes of the binary system in

  The most difficult problem in the two-dimensional Toda-Liouville DG is to

Furthermore, in networks carrying traffic load, the failure of one node can
result in redistribution of the load onto other nearby nodes. If these nodes
fail due to excessive load, then this process can result in a cascading
failure. Using a simple but descriptive model, we show that the cascading
failure problem for large-scale wireless networks is equivalent to a
degree-dependent site percolation on random geometric graphs. We obtain
analytical conditions for cascades in this model.

frames. Moreover, the azimuthal anisotropy can be, in certain frames, as
significant as the polar one. The seemingly contradictory J/psi polarization
results reported by E866, HERA-B and CDF can be consistently described assuming
that the most suitable axis for the measurement is along the direction of the
relative motion of the colliding partons, and that directly produced J/psi's
are longitudinally polarized at low momentum and transversely polarized at high
momentum. We make specific predictions that can be tested on existing CDF data
and by LHC measurements, which should show a full transverse polarization for
direct J/psi mesons of pT > 25 GeV/c.

effectively overcome by emulating double precision for calculating the distance

Submillimetre Survey (LESS), a sensitive 870-um survey (~1.2-mJy rms) of the
full 30'x30' ECDFS with the LABOCA camera on the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment
(APEX) telescope. The submm emission is identified with a radio counterpart for
which optical spectroscopy provides a redshift of z=4.76. We show that the
bolometric emission is dominated by a starburst with a star formation rate of
~1000 Msun/yr, although we also identify a moderate luminosity Active Galactic
Nucleus (AGN) in this galaxy. Thus it has characteristics similar to those of
z~2 submm galaxies (SMGs), with a mix of starburst and obscured AGN signatures.
This demonstrates that ultraluminous starburst activity is not just restricted
to the hosts of the most luminous (and hence rare) QSOs at z~5, but was also
occurring in less extreme galaxies at a time when the Universe was less than
10% of its current age. Assuming that we are seeing the major phase of star
formation in this galaxy, then we demonstrate that it would be identified as a
luminous distant red galaxy at z~3 and that the current estimate of the space
density of z>4 SMGs is only sufficient to produce ~10% of the luminous red
galaxy population at these early times. However, this leaves open the
possibility that some of these galaxies formed through less intense, but more
extended star formation events. If the progenitors of all of the luminous red
galaxies at z~3 go through an ultraluminous starburst at z>4 then the required
volume density of z>4 SMGs will exceed that predicted by current galaxy
formation models by more than an order of magnitude.

in rapidly accreting protoplanetary disks, based on a number of observational
properties. A fundamental test of the accretion disk scenario is that the
differentially rotating disk spectrum should produce a variation of rotational
velocity with the wavelength of observation, as spectra taken at longer
wavelengths probe outer, more slowly rotating disk regions. Previous
observations of FU Ori have shown smaller rotation at near-infrared (~ 2.2
micron) wavelengths than observed at optical (~ 0.6 micron) wavelengths
consistent with the assumption of Keplerian rotation. Here we report a spectrum
from the Phoenix instrument on Gemini South which shows that differential
(slower) rotation continues to be observed out to ~ 5 micron. The observed
spectrum is well matched by the prediction of our accretion disk model
previously constructed to match the observed spectral energy distribution and
the differential rotation at wavelengths < 2.2 micron. This kinematic result
allows us to confirm our previous inference of a large outer radius (~ 1 AU)
for the rapidly accreting region of the FU Ori disk, which presents
difficulties for outburst models relying purely on thermal instability. While
some optical spectra have been interpreted to pose problems for the disk
interpretation of FU Ori, we show that the adjustment of the maximum effective
temperature of the disk model, proposed in a previous paper, greatly reduces
these difficulties.

explored two simple geometrical scenarios for which we derived physical
quantities of the absorbing material like the density, size, and mass. We find
that the continuum is absorbed by a neutral gas, and by both a collisionally
(temperature T~70 eV) and photoionised (ionisation parameter log\xi~2.5)
absorbers. Emission lines from OVII and OVIII are also detected. This is the
first time that evidence of a collisionally ionised absorber has been found in
a low-mass X-ray binary. The collisionally ionised absorber may be in the form
of dense (n>10^14 cm^-3) filaments, located at a distance r>10^11 cm. During
dips, the photoionised absorber significantly increases its column density
(factor 2--4) while becoming less ionised. This strengthens the idea that the
colder material of the accretion stream impinging the disc is passing on our
line of sight during dips. We find that the distance from the neutron star to
the impact region (~ 5x10^10 cm) is similar to the size of the neutron star's
Roche lobe. The gas observed during the persistent state may have a flattened
geometry. Finally, we explore the possibility of the existence of material
forming an initial, hotter portion of a circumbinary disc.

triplet-quintet intersystem electron collisions, a form of coupling previously

generally severe for models (both giants and dwarfs) with higher T_eff.
Interestingly, in metal-poor turn-off stars, the negative non-LTE abundance
corrections tend to rapidly become more severe towards lower metallicity. When
neglecting H collisions, they amount to as much as ~ 0.9 dex and ~ 1.2 dex,
respectively at [Fe/H]=-3 and [Fe/H]=-3.5. Even when such collisions are
included, the LTE abundance remains a serious overestimate, correspondingly by

a series of wave packets with nearly constant period, typically persisting for
4-6 cycles with a lifetime of 20-30 min. There is an approximate in-phase
relation between Doppler shift and intensity oscillations. This provides
evidence for slow magnetoacoustic waves propagating upwards from the transition
region into the corona. We find that the oscillations detected in the five
coronal lines are highly correlated, and the amplitude decreases with
increasing temperature. The amplitude of Doppler shift oscillations decrease by
a factor of about 3, while that of relative intensity decreases by a factor of
about 4 from Fe X to Fe XV. These oscillations may be caused by the leakage of
the photospheric p-modes through the chromosphere and transition region into
the corona, which has been suggested as the source for intensity oscillations
previously observed by TRACE. The temperature dependence of the oscillation
amplitudes can be explained by damping of the waves traveling along the loop

represents a foundation for other more sophisticated distributed and
asynchronous MAC protocols, e.g., CSMA. In this paper, unlike in the
traditional work that focused on mean value analysis, we study the
distributional properties of packet transmission delays over an ALOHA channel.
We discover a new phenomenon showing that a basic finite population ALOHA model
with variable size (exponential) packets is characterized by power law
transmission delays, possibly even resulting in zero throughput. These results
are in contrast to the classical work that shows exponential delays and
positive throughput for finite population ALOHA with fixed packets.
Furthermore, we characterize a new stability condition that is entirely derived
from the tail behavior of the packet and backoff distributions that may not be
determined by mean values. The power law effects and the possible instability
might be diminished, or perhaps eliminated, by reducing the variability of
packets. However, we show that even a slotted (synchronized) ALOHA with packets
of constant size can exhibit power law delays when the number of active users
is random. From an engineering perspective, our results imply that the
variability of packet sizes and number of active users need to be taken into

performed to investigate how a magnetically confined mountain on an accreting
neutron star relaxes resistively. No evidence is found for non-ideal MHD
instabilities on a short time-scale, such as the resistive ballooning mode or
the tearing mode. Instead, the mountain relaxes gradually as matter is
transported across magnetic surfaces on the diffusion time-scale, which
evaluates to $\tau_\mathrm{I} \sim 10^5 - 10^8$ yr (depending on the
conductivity of the neutron star crust) for an accreted mass of $M_a = 1.2
\times 10^{-4} M_\odot$. The magnetic dipole moment simultaneously reemerges as
the screening currents dissipate over $\tau_\mathrm{I}$. For nonaxisymmetric
mountains, ohmic dissipation tends to restore axisymmetry by magnetic
reconnection at a filamentary neutral sheet in the equatorial plane. Ideal-MHD
oscillations on the Alfv\'{e}n time-scale, which can be excited by external
influences, such as variations in the accretion torque, compress the magnetic
field and hence decrease $\tau_\mathrm{I}$ by \change{one order of magnitude}
relative to its standard value (as computed for the static configuration). The
implications of long-lived mountains for gravitational wave emission from
low-mass X-ray binaries are briefly explored.

one. The sloshing mode has the same frequency as the torsional oscillation
discovered by Funfschilling and Ahlers (2004). We show that both modes can be
described by an extension of a model developed previously [Brown and Ahlers
(2008)] which consists of permitting a lateral displacement of the LSC
circulation plane away from the vertical center line of the sample as well as a
variation in displacements with height (such displacements had been excluded in
the original model). Pressure gradients produced by the side wall of the
container on average center the plane of the LSC so that it prefers to reach
its longest diameter. If the LSC is displaced away from this diameter, the
walls provide a restoring force. Turbulent fluctuations drive the LSC away from
the central alignment, and combined with the restoring force they lead to
oscillations. These oscillations are advected along with the LSC. This model
predicts the correct wavenumber and phase of the oscillations, as well as
estimates of the frequency, amplitude, and probability distributions of the
displacements.

group membership, local environment, and redshift in a very large, $500h^{-1}
Mpc$, cosmological N-body simulation, the \textit{Millennium Simulation}. The
goal is to provide environmental diagnostics of major merger populations in
order to test simulations against observations and provide further constraints
on major merger driven galaxy evolution scenarios. A halo sample is defined
using the maximum circular velocity, which is both well defined for subhalos
and closely correlated with galaxy luminosity. Subhalos, including the
precursors of major mergers, are severely tidally stripped. Major mergers
between subhalos are therefore extremely rare. Tidal stripping also suppresses
dynamical friction, resulting in long major merger time scales when the more
massive halo does not host other subhalos. In contrast, when other subhalos are
present major merger time scales are several times shorter. This enhancement is
likely due to inelastic unbound collisions between subhalos. Following these
results, we predict that major mergers in group environments are dominated by
mergers involving the central galaxy, that the specific merger rate is
suppressed in groups, and that the frequency of fainter companions is enhanced
for mergers and their remnants. We also observe an `assembly bias' in the major
merger rate in that mergers of galaxy-like halos are slightly suppressed in
overdense environments while mergers of group-like halos are slightly enhanced.
A dynamical explanation for this trend is advanced which calls on both tidal
effects and interactions between bound halos beyond the virial radii of locally
dynamically dominant halos.

draw the solutions together as time goes to infinity. Such ""asymptotic

emphasis here is on stochastic differential delay equations.Harris' celebrated
theorem states that if a Markov chain admits a Lyapunov function whose level
sets are ""small"" (in the sense that transition probabilities are uniformly
bounded from below), then it admits a unique invariant measure and transition
probabilities converge towards it at exponential speed. This convergence takes
place in a total variation norm, weighted by the Lyapunov function. A second
aim of this article is to replace the notion of a ""small set"" by the much
weaker notion of a ""d-small set,"" which takes the topology of the underlying
space into account via a distance-like function d. With this notion at hand, we
prove an analogue to Harris' theorem, where the convergence takes place in a
Wasserstein-like distance weighted again by the Lyapunov function. This
abstract result is then applied to the framework of stochastic delay equations.

Boo and alpha Boo), in order to check whether the K abundances are uniform
within a cluster and to investigate the behavior of [K/Fe] ratio at the
relevant metallicity range of -2.5 <[Fe/H] < -1. We confirmed that [K/H] (as
well as [Fe/H]) is almost homogeneous within each cluster to a precision of <
~0.1 dex, though dubiously large deviations are exceptionally seen for two
peculiar stars showing signs of considerably increased turbulence in the upper
atmosphere. The resulting [K/Fe] ratios are mildly supersolar by a few tenths
of dex for three clusters, tending to gradually increase from ~+0.1-0.2 at
[Fe/H] ~-1 to ~+0.3 at [Fe/H] ~ -2.5. This result connects reasonably well with
the [K/Fe] trend of disk stars (-1 < [Fe/H]) and that of extremely metal-poor
stars (-4 <[Fe/H] < -2.5). That is, [K/Fe] appears to continue a gradual
increase from [Fe/H]~0 toward a lower metallicity regime down to [Fe/H]~-3,
where a broad maximum of [K/Fe]~+0.3-0.4 is attained, possibly followed by a
slight downturn at [Fe/H]<~-3.

assumed to be enclosed in a giant $S^3$-spherical shell of significant
thickness, which expands (ultra)relativisticaly in Minkowski (1+4)$D$-space.
This model, as compared with the kinematic (1+3)$D$ Milne cosmological model
(which was reinvented by Prof Farley), goes in line with the Copernican
principle: any galaxy observes the same isotropic distribution of distant
galaxies and supernovae, as well as the same Hubble plot of SN Ia distance
modulus $\mu$ vs redshift $z$. A good fit is obtained (no free parameters); it
coincides with the Milne model (empty model) at low $z$, while shows some more
luminosity at high $z$, leading to 1% decrease in the true distance modulus
(and 50% increase in luminosity) at $z\sim2$.
  The model proposed can be also interpreted as a sort of FLRW-model with the
scale factor $a(t)=t/t_0$; this could hardly be a solution of general
relativity (without inventing some super-dark energy with $w=-1/3$, a sort of
dark curvature); 5$D$ GR is also unsuitable -- it has no longitudinal

the Milky Way and other disc galaxies form by condensation of the hot galactic

is well represented by a non-rotating, stratified atmosphere, we find that for
this formation mechanism to work the corona must have an almost perfectly flat
entropy profile. In all other cases the growth of thermal perturbations is
suppressed by a combination of buoyancy and thermal conduction. Even if the
entropy profile were nearly flat, cold clouds with sizes smaller than 10 kpc
could form in the corona of the Milky Way only at radii larger than 100 kpc, in
contradiction with the determined distances of the largest HVC complexes.
Clouds with sizes of a few kpc can form in the inner halo only in low-mass
systems. We conclude that unless even slow rotation qualitatively changes the
dynamics of a corona, thermal instability is unlikely to be a viable mechanism
for formation of cold clouds around disc galaxies.

a text file, so there is a need for a visualization tool to animate the
simulation of the wireless network. The purpose of this tool is to help the
researcher examine in detail how the wireless protocol works both on a network
and a node basis. It is clear that much of this information is protocol
dependent and cannot be depicted properly by a general purpose animation
process. Existing animation tools do not provide this level of information
neither permit the specific protocol to control the animation at all. EXAMS is
an NS-2 visualization tool for mobile simulations which makes possible the
portrayal of NS-2 internal information like transmission properties and node
data structures. This is mainly possible due to EXAMS extensible architecture
which separates the animation process into a general and a protocol specific
part. The latter can be developed independently by the protocol designer and
loaded on demand. These and other useful characteristics of the EXAMS tool can
be an invaluable help for a researcher in order to investigate and debug a

rate. Variable mass supply rate occurs, e.g., during disc state transitions,
and in interacting eccentric binaries. It is, however, damped by the viscosity
of the disc. Here, we calculate this damping in detail. We derive an analytical
description of the propagation of the flow rate using the solution of
Lynden-Bell & Pringle, in which the disc is assumed to extend to infinity. In
particular, we derive the accretion-rate Green's function, and its Fourier
transform, which gives the fractional damping at a given variability frequency.
We then compare this model to that of a finite disc with the mass supply at its
outer edge. We find significant differences with respect to the infinite disc
solution, which we find to overestimate the viscous damping. In particular, the
asymptotic form of the Green's function is power-law for the infinite disc and
exponential for the finite one. We then find a simple fitting form for the
latter, and also calculate its Fourier transform. In general, the damping
becomes very strong when the viscous time at the outer edge of the disc becomes
longer than the modulation time scale. We apply our results to a number of
astrophysical systems. We find the effect is much stronger in low-mass X-ray
binaries, where the disc size is comparable to that of the Roche lobe, than in
high-mass binaries, where the wind-fed disc can have a much smaller size.

fill the penumbral photosphere. Flows along these arched field lines are
responsible for both the Evershed effect and the convective transport. This
scenario seems to be qualitatively consistent with most existing observations,
including the dark cores in penumbral filaments reported by Scharmer et al.
Each bright filament with dark core would be a system of two paired convective
rolls with the dark core tracing the common lane where the plasma sinks down.
The magnetic loops would have a hot footpoint in one of the bright filament and
a cold footpoint in the dark core. The scenario fits in most of our theoretical
prejudices (siphon flows along field lines, presence of overturning convection,
drag of field lines by downdrafts, etc). If the conjecture turns out to be
correct, the mild upward and downward velocities observed in penumbrae must
increase upon improving the resolution. This and other observational tests to
support or disprove the scenario are put forward.

in detail the case of two plane-parallel material slabs, separated by an empty
gap, and we show that at all points in the empty region between the slabs,
including their surfaces, the electromagnetic fields always satisfy free-field
canonical equal-time commutation relations. This result is a consequence of
general analyticity and fall-off properties at large frequencies satisfied by
the reflection coefficients of all real materials. It is also shown that this
result does not obtain in the case of conductors, if the latter are modelled as
perfect mirrors. In such a case, the free-field form of the commutation
relations is recovered only at large distances from the mirrors, in agreement
with the findings of previous authors. Failure of perfect-mirror boundary
conditions to reproduce the correct form of the commutation relations near the
surfaces of the conductors, suggests that caution should be used when these
idealized boundary conditions are used in investigations of proximity phenomena
originating from the quantized electromagnetic field, like the Casimir effect.

1396N core and the molecular outflows detected in the region and to reveal the
presence of additional YSOs inside this globule. Methods. We carried out a deep
survey of the IC 1396N region in the J, H, K' broadband filters and deep
high-angular resolution observations in the H2 narrowband filter with NICS at
the TNG telescope. The completeness limits in the 2MASS standard are Ks~17.5,
H~18.5 and J~19.5. Results. A total of 736 sources have been detected in all
three bands within the area where the JHK' images overlap. There are 128
sources detected only in HK', 67 detected only in K', and 79 detected only in
H. We found only few objects exhibiting a Near-Infrared excess and no clear
signs of clustering of sources towards the southern rim. In case of triggered
star formation in the southern rim of the globule, this could be very recent,
because it is not evidenced through Near-Infrared imaging alone. The H2
emission is complex and knotty and shows a large number of molecular hydrogen
features spread over the region, testifying a recent star-formation activity
throughout the whole globule. This emission is resolved into several chains or
groups of knots that sometimes show a jet-like morphology. The shocked cloudlet
model scenario previously proposed to explain the V-shaped morphology of the CO
molecular outflow powered by the intermediate-mass YSO BIMA 2 seems to be
confirmed by the presence of H2 emission at the position of the deflecting
western clump. New possible flows have been discovered in the globule,

braking on the evolution of such systems. A phase-plane analysis of a
simplified system of equations, including only the stellar tide together with a
model of the braking torque proposed by Verbunt & Zwaan (1981), is presented.
The inclusion of stellar magnetic braking is found to be extremely important in
determining the secular evolution of such systems, and its neglect results in a
very different orbital history. We then show the results of numerical
integrations of the full tidal evolution equations, using the misaligned spin
and orbit of the XO-3 system as an example, to study the accuracy of simple
timescale estimates of tidal evolution. We find that it is essential to
consider coupled evolution of the orbit and the stellar spin in order to model
the behaviour accurately. In addition, we find that for typical Hot Jupiters
the stellar spin-orbit alignment timescale is of the same order as the inspiral
time, which tells us that if a planet is observed to be aligned, then it
probably formed coplanar. This reinforces the importance of Rossiter-McLaughlin

neglect can result in a very different system history. We then present the
results of numerical integrations of the tidal evolution equations, where we
find that it is essential to consider coupled evolution of the orbital and
rotational elements, including dissipation in both the star and planet, to
accurately model the evolution. The main result of our integrations is that for
typical Hot Jupiters, tidal friction aligns the stellar spin with the orbit on
a similar time as it causes the orbit to decay. This means that if a planet is
observed to be aligned, then it probably formed coplanar. This reinforces the
importance of Rossiter-McLaughlin effect observations in determining the degree
of spin-orbit alignment in transiting systems. We apply these results to the
XO-3 system, and constrain the tidal quality factors Q' in both the star and
planet in this system. Using a model in which inertial waves are excited by
tidal forcing in the outer convective envelope and dissipated by turbulent
viscosity, we calculate Q' for a range of F-star models, and find it to vary
considerably within this class of stars. This means that assuming a single Q'
applies to all stars is probably incorrect. We propose an explanation for the

effective potential, up to second order in the coupling, for the theory in
$1+1$ and $2+1$ space-time dimensions. We found that the obtained effective
potential is bounded from below, which proves the vacuum stability of the
theory in space-time dimensions higher than the previously studied $0+1$ case.
In our calculations, we used the canonical quantization regime in which one
deals with operators rather than classical functions used in the path integral
formulation. Therefore, the non-Hermiticity of the effective field theory is
obvious. Moreover, the method we employ implements the canonical equal-time
commutation relations and the Heisenberg picture for the operators. Thus, the
metric operator is implemented in the calculations of the transition
amplitudes. Accordingly, the method avoids the very complicated calculations
needed in other methods for the metric operator. To test the accuracy of our

small coupling values, which has been obtained in the literature using other

transient workload of a multi-queue single-server system is established where
the service rates are chosen from a compact, convex and coordinate-convex rate
region and where the service discipline is the max-weight policy. Under the
assumption that the arrival processes satisfy a many-sources LDP, this is
accomplished by employing Garcia's extended contraction principle that is
applicable to quasi-continuous mappings.
  For the simplex rate-region, an LDP for the stationary workload is also
established under the additional requirements that the scheduling policy be
work-conserving and that the arrival processes satisfy certain mixing
conditions.
  The LDP results can be used to calculate asymptotic buffer overflow
probabilities accounting for the multiplexing gain, when the arrival process is
an average of \emph{i.i.d.} processes. The rate function for the stationary
workload is expressed in term of the rate functions of the finite-horizon
workloads when the arrival processes have \emph{i.i.d.} increments.

collapse or pair-creation instability phases. We adopt the following stellar
mass-dependent accretion rates which are derived from cosmological simulations
of early structure formation based on the low mass dark matter halos at
redshifts $z \sim 20$: (1) the accretion rates for the first generation (Pop
III.1) stars and (2) the rates for zero-metallicity but the second generation
(Pop III.2) stars which are affected by radiation from the Pop III.1 stars. For
comparison, we also study the evolution with the mass-dependent accretion rates

III.1 stars can be as large as $\sim 1000M_{\odot}$, beyond the mass range
($140 - 300M_{\odot}$) for the pair-instability supernovae. Such massive stars
undergo core-collapse to form intermediate-mass black holes, which may be the
seeds for merger trees to supermassive black holes. On the other hand, Pop
III.2 stars become less massive ($\lsim 40 - 60M_{\odot}$), being in the mass
range of ordinary iron core-collapse stars. Such stars explode and eject heavy
elements to contribute to chemical enrichment of the early universe as observed

\cite{1}, who showed an example that is consistent with General Relativity
(GR). By now, the possibility of a rotating universe has been discussed
comprehensively in the framework of some types of Bianchi's models, such as
Type V, VII and IX \cite{2,3}, and different approaches have been proposed to
constrain the rotation. Recent discoveries of some non-Gaussian properties of
the Cosmic Microwave Background Anisotropies (CMBA)
\cite{nG1,nG2,nG3,nG4,nG5,nG6,nG7}, such as the suppression of the quadrupole
and the alignment of some multipoles draw attention to some Bianchi models with
rotation \cite{bi1,bi2}. However, cosmological data, such as those of the CMBA,
strongly prefer a homogeneous and isotropic model. Therefore, it is of interest
to discuss the rotation of the universe as a perturbation of the
Robertson-Walker metric, to constrain the rotating speed by cosmological data
and to discuss whether it could be the origin of the non-Gaussian properties of
the CMBA mentioned above. Here, we derive the general form of the metric (up to
2nd-order perturbations) which is compatible with the rotation perturbation in
a flat $\Lambda$-CDM universe. By comparing the 2nd-order Sachs-Wolfe effect
\cite{4,5,6,7,8} due to rotation with the CMBA data, we constrain the angular
speed of the rotation to be less than $10^{-9}$ rad yr$^{-1}$ at the last
scattering surface. This provides the first constraint on the shear-free
rotation of a $\Lambda$CDM universe.

  The observations were carried out in the near-infrared part of the spectrum
to mitigate the glare from the planet. Frames were acquired at rates > 1/min.
Following modelling and subtraction of the planetary source from these frames,
differential aperture photometry was carried out on the satellite pairs
involved in the predicted events. In all cases but one, nearby bright
satellites were used as reference sources.
  We have obtained fifteen individual lightcurves, eight of which show a clear
drop in the flux from the satellite pair, indicating that a mutual event took
place. Three of these involve the faint satellite Miranda. All eight
lightcurves were model-fitted to yield best estimates of the time of maximum
flux drop and the impact parameter. In three cases best-fit albedo ratios were
also derived. We used these estimates to generate intersatellite astrometric
positions with typical formal uncertainties of <0.01 arcsec, several times
better than conventional astrometry of these satellites. The statistics of our
estimated event midtimes show a systematic lag, with the observations later
than predictions. In addition, lightcurves of two partial eclipses of Miranda
show no statistically significant evidence of a light drop, at variance with
the predictions. These indicate that new information about the Uranian

$K$-primitive matrices $A$, is denoted by $\gamma(K)$. It is proved that for
any positive integers $m,n, 3 \le n \le m$, the maximum value of $\gamma(K)$,
as $K$ runs through all $n$-dimensional polyhedral cones with $m$ extreme rays,
equals $(n-1)(m-1)+1$ when $m$ is even or $m$ and $n$ are both odd, and is at
least $(n-1)(m-1)$ and at most $(n-1)(m-1)+1$ when $m$ is odd and $n$ is even.
For the cases when $m = n, m = n+1$ or $n = 3$, the cones $K$ and the
corresponding $K$-primitive matrices $A$ such that $\gamma(K)$ and $\gamma(A)$
attain the maximum value are identified up to respectively linear isomorphism
and cone-equivalence modulo positive scalar multiplication.

HD 80606b, an object in a highly-eccentric orbit (e ~ 0.93) about its parent
star of approximately solar type. The astrophysical reality of the signal of
variability in HD 80606 is confirmed by observation with two independent
telescope systems, and checks against several reference stars in the field.
Differential photometry with respect to the nearby comparison star HD 80607
provides a precise light curve. Modelling of the light curve with a full
eccentric-orbit model indicates a planet/star-radius ratio of 0.1057 +/-
0.0018, corresponding to a planet radius of 1.029 R_J for a solar-radius parent
star; and a precise orbital inclination of 89.285 +/- 0.023 degrees, giving a
total transit duration of 12.1 +/- 0.4 hours. The planet hence joins HD 17156b
in a class of highly eccentric transiting planets, in which HD 80606b has both
the longest period and most eccentric orbit. The recently reported discovery of
a secondary eclipse of HD 80606b by the Spitzer Space Observatory permits a
combined analysis with the mid-time of primary transit in which the orbital
parameters of the system can be tightly constrained. We derive a transit
ephemeris of T_tr = HJD (2454876.344 +/- 0.011) + (111.4277 +/- 0.0032) E.

recently due to its potential to address power concerns in nanoelectronics. The
recently discovered graphene nanoribbon (GNR) is ideal for tunneling FETs due
to its symmetric bandstructure, light effective mass, and monolayer-thin body.
In this work, we examine the device physics of p-i-n GNR tunneling FETs using
atomistic quantum transport simulations. The important role of the edge bond
relaxation in the device characteristics is identified. The device, however,
has ambipolar I-V characteristics, which are not preferred for digital
electronics applications. We suggest that using either an asymmetric
source-drain doping or a properly designed gate underlap can effectively
suppress the ambipolar I-V. A subthreshold slope of 14mV/dec and a
significantly improved on-off ratio can be obtained by the p-i-n GNR tunneling
FETs.

cohomology classes for the symmetric space associated to GO(V) for an
indefinite rational quadratic space V of even dimension to holomorphic Siegel
modular forms on GSp_n(A). For n=2 we prove Thom's Lemma for hyperbolic
3-space, which together with results of Kudla and Millson imply an
interpretation of the Fourier coefficients of the theta lift as period
integrals of the cohomology class over certain cycles. This allows us to prove
the p-integrality of the lift for a particular choice of Schwartz function for
almost all primes p. We further calculate the Hecke eigenvalues (including for
some ""bad"" places) for this choice in the case of V of signature (3,1).

for the ratios of quark and lepton masses (or Yukawa couplings) at the
unification scale. Due to supersymmetric (SUSY) threshold corrections the
viability of such predictions can depend strongly on the SUSY parameters. For
three common minimal SUSY breaking scenarios with anomaly, gauge and gravity
mediation we investigate which GUT scale ratios $m_e/m_d$, $m_\mu/m_s$,
$y_\tau/y_b$ and $y_t/y_b$ are allowed when phenomenological constraints from
electroweak precision observables, $B$ physics, $(g-2)_\mu$, mass-limits on
sparticles from direct searches as well as, optionally, constraints from the
observed dark matter density are taken into account. We derive possible new
predictions for the GUT scale mass ratios and compare them with the
phenomenologically allowed ranges. We find that new GUT scale predictions such
as $m_\mu/m_s = 9/2$ or 6 and $y_\tau/y_b = 3/2$ or 2 are often favoured
compared to the ubiquitous relations $m_\mu/m_s = 3$ or $y_\tau/y_b =1$. They
are viable for characteristic SUSY scenarios, testable at the CERN LHC and
future colliders.
