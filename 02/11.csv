detection of gravitational waves (GWs). The ground-based LIGO and Virgo GW
observatories are being upgraded to advanced sensitivity, and are expected to
observe a significant binary merger rate. The launch of The Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) would extend the GW window to low
frequencies, opening new vistas on dynamical processes involving massive (M >~
10^5 M_Sun) black holes. GW events are likely to be accompanied by
electromagnetic (EM) counterparts and, since information carried
electromagnetically is complementary to that carried gravitationally, a great
deal can be learned about an event and its environment if it becomes possible
to measure both forms of radiation in concert. Measurements of this kind will
mark the dawn of trans-spectral astrophysics, bridging two distinct spectral
bands of information. The aim of this whitepaper is to articulate future
directions in both theory and observation that are likely to impact broad
astrophysical inquiries of general interest. What will EM observations reflect
on the nature and diversity of GW sources? Can GW sources be exploited as
complementary probes of cosmology? What cross-facility coordination will expand
the science returns of gravitational and electromagnetic observations?

for various extended reionization histories described by a simple analytic
form. These models are parametrized by dz, the duration of the reionization
event. For reionization histories with identical values of tau_r, the OV
amplitude at l = 3000 (C_3000) differs by ~20 % between the models with dz =
0.1 and dz = 3.0. We demonstrate that the removal of the z < 6 component of the
OV signal will significantly enhance the ability to differentiate between
reionization histories, with C_3000 varying by a factor of ~2 between the

propose an ansatz for the form of the dilaton field, $|\phi(a)|/m_P \equiv

the dark energy equation of state. Sensible constraints are imposed on model

feedback for smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations. We consider the
timed release of individual elements by both massive (Type II supernovae and
stellar winds) and intermediate mass stars (Type Ia supernovae and asymptotic
giant branch stars). We illustrate the results of our method using a suite of
cosmological simulations that include new prescriptions for radiative cooling,
star formation, and galactic winds. Radiative cooling is implemented
element-by-element, in the presence of an ionizing radiation background, and we
track all 11 elements that contribute significantly to the radiative cooling.
We contrast two reasonable definitions of the metallicity of a resolution
element and find that while they agree for high metallicities, there are large
differences at low metallicities. We argue the discrepancy is indicative of the
lack of metal mixing caused by the fact that metals are stuck to particles. We
argue that since this is a (numerical) sampling problem, solving it using a
poorly constrained physical process such as diffusion could have undesired
consequences. We demonstrate that the two metallicity definitions result in
redshift z = 0 stellar masses that can differ by up to a factor of two, because
of the sensitivity of the cooling rates to the elemental abundances. We find
that by z = 0 most of the metals are locked up in stars. The gaseous metals are
distributed over a very wide range of gas densities and temperatures. The
shock-heated warm-hot intergalactic medium has a relatively high metallicity of
~ 10^-1 Z_sun that evolves only weakly and is therefore an important reservoir
of metals.

it creates at a temperature T while moving through a plasma using a gravity
dual that captures the renormalisation group runnings in the dual gauge theory.
Our gravity dual has a black hole and seven branes embedded via Ouyang
embedding, but the geometry is a deformation of the usual conifold metric. In
particular the gravity dual has squashed two spheres, and a small resolution at
the IR. Using this background we show that the drag of a massive quark receives
corrections that are proportional to powers of log T when compared with the
drag computed using AdS/QCD correspondence. We use the perturbation produced by
the quark strings to compute the wake and compare with the results obtained
using AdS/QCD correspondence. We also study the shear viscosity with running
couplings, analyze the viscosity to entropy ratio and compare the result with
the known bound. In the presence of higher order curvature square corrections
from the back-reactions of the embedded D7 branes, we argue the possibility of
the entropy to viscosity bound being violated. Finally, we show that our set-up
could in-principle allow us to study a family of gauge theories at the boundary
by cutting off the dual geometry respectively at various points in the radial
direction. All these gauge theories can have well defined UV completions, and
more interestingly, we demonstrate that any thermodynamical quantities derived
from these theories would be completely independent of the cut-off scale and
only depend on the temperature at which we define these theories. Such a result
would justify the holographic renormalisabilities of these theories which we,
in turn, also demonstrate. We give physical interpretations of these results

moving soliton and a dispersive term. Furthermore, a solution starting on N
remains on N for all positive time and for some finite negative time and N can
be identified as the centre-stable manifold for this equation. The proof is
based on the method of modulation, introduced by Soffer and Weinstein and
adapted by Schlag to the L^2-supercritical case. Novel elements include a

using various interferometric combination schemes. More recently we proposed a
new detection principle aimed at directly sampling and extracting the spectral
information of an input signal together with its flux level measurement. The
so-called SWIFTS demonstrated concept that stands for Stationary-Wave
Integrated Fourier Transform Spectrometer, provides full spectral and spatial
information recorded simultaneously thanks to a motionless detecting device.
  Due to some newly available detection principles considered for the
implementation of the SWIFTS concept, some technologies can even provide
photo-counting operation that brought a significant extension of the
interferometry domain of investigation in astrophysics . The proposed concept
is applicable to most of the interferometric instrumental modes including
fringe tracking, fast and sensitive detection, Fourier spectral reconstruction
and also to manage a large number of incoming beams. The paper presents three
practical implementations, two dealing with pair-wise integrated optics beam
combinations and the third one with an all-in-one 8 beam combination. In all

radiation near the forward shocks of young shell-type supernova remnants, for
which X-ray data indicate a strong amplification of turbulent magnetic field.
Modeling the magnetic turbulence through the superposition of waves, we
calculate the degree of polarization and the magnetic polarization direction
which is at $90^\circ$ to the conventional electric polarization direction. We
find that isotropic strong turbulence will produce weakly polarized radio
emission even in the absence of internal Faraday rotation. If anisotropy is
imposed on the magnetic-field structure, the degree of polarization can be
significantly increased, provided internal Faraday rotation is inefficient.
Both for shock compression and a mixture with a homogeneous field, the increase
in polarization degree goes along with a fairly precise alignment of the
magnetic-polarization angle with the direction of the dominant magnetic-field
component, implying tangential magnetic polarization at the rims in the case of
shock compression. We compare our model with high-resolution radio polarimetry
data of Tycho's remnant. Using the absence of internal Faraday rotation we find
a soft limit for the amplitude of magnetic turbulence, $\delta B \lesssim 200\
{\rm \mu G}$. The data are compatible with a turbulent magnetic field
superimposed on a radial large-scale field of similar amplitude, $\delta
B\simeq B_0$. An alternative viable scenario involves anisotropic turbulence
with stronger amplitudes in the radial direction, as was observed in recent MHD
simulations of shocks propagating through a medium with significant density
fluctuations.

spontaneous magnetization, both at sample edges and at domain walls between
regions of different chirality. Indeed, muon spin resonance experiments are
interpreted as evidence of spontaneous magnetization due to domain walls or
defects in the bulk. However, recent magnetic microscopy experiments place
upper limits on the magentic fields at the sample edge and surface which are as
much as two orders of magnitude smaller than the fields predicted theoretically
for a somewhat idealized chiral p-wave superconductor. We investigate the
effects on the spontaneous supercurrents and magnetization of rough and pair
breaking surfaces for a range of parameters within a Ginzburg-Landau formalism.

the observed size distributions of metastases, while size-independent growth
rates cannot account for clinical and experimental data. In addition, it
potentially explains the observed preferential growth of metastases on tissue
surfaces and membranes such as the pleural and peritoneal layers, suggests a
mechanism underlying the seed and soil hypothesis introduced by Stephen Paget

relating it to the runtime of randomized broadcast. In particular, we strongly
confirm for dense graphs the intuition of Chandra et al. \cite{CRRST97} that
""the cover time of the graph is an appropriate metric for the performance of
certain kinds of randomized broadcast algorithms"". In more detail, our results
are as follows: For any graph $G=(V,E)$ of size $n$ and minimum degree
$\delta$, we have $\mathcal{R}(G)= \Oh(\frac{|E|}{\delta} \cdot \log n)$, where
$\mathcal{R}(G)$ denotes the quotient of the cover time and broadcast time.
This bound is tight for binary trees and tight up to logarithmic factors for
many graphs including hypercubes, expanders and lollipop graphs. For any
$\delta$-regular (or almost $\delta$-regular) graph $G$ it holds that
$\mathcal{R}(G) = \Omega(\frac{\delta^2}{n} \cdot \frac{1}{\log n})$. Together
with our upper bound on $\mathcal{R}(G)$, this lower bound strongly confirms
the intuition of Chandra et al. for graphs with minimum degree $\Theta(n)$,
since then the cover time equals the broadcast time multiplied by $n$
(neglecting logarithmic factors). Conversely, for any $\delta$ we construct
almost $\delta$-regular graphs that satisfy $\mathcal{R}(G) = \Oh(\max
\{\sqrt{n},\delta \} \cdot \log^2 n)$. Since any regular expander satisfies
$\mathcal{R}(G) = \Theta(n)$, the strong relationship given above does not hold
if $\delta$ is polynomially smaller than $n$. Our bounds also demonstrate that
the relationship between cover time and broadcast time is much stronger than
the known relationships between any of them and the mixing time (or the closely
related spectral gap).

diagram and the behavior of the diffusion coefficient in an associating lattice
gas (ALG) model on different regions of the phase diagram. The ALG model
combines a two dimensional lattice gas where particles interact through a soft
core potential and orientational degrees of freedom. The competition between
soft core potential and directional attractive forces results in a high density
liquid phase, a low density liquid phase, and a gas phase. Besides anomalies in
the behavior of the density with the temperature at constant pressure and of
the diffusion coefficient with density at constant temperature are also found.
The two liquid phases are separated by a coexistence line that ends in a
bicritical point. The low density liquid phase is separated from the gas phase
by a coexistence line that ends in tricritical point. The bicritical and
tricritical points are linked by a critical $\lambda$-line. The high density
liquid phase and the fluid phases are separated by a second $\tau$ critical
line. We then investigate how the diffusion coefficient behaves on different
regions of the chemical potential-temperature phase diagram. We find that
diffusivity undergoes two types of dynamic transitions: a fragile-to-strong
trans ition when the critical $\lambda$-line is crossed by decreasing the
temperature at a constant chemical potential; and a strong-to-strong transition
when the $\tau$-critical line is crossed by decreasing the temperature at a
constant chemical potential.

polymerization of the generalized area variable alone leads to a complete,

replaced by a bounce. The bounce radius is independent of rescalings of the
homogeneous internal coordinate, but does depend on the arbitrary fiducial cell
size. The model is therefore necessarily incomplete. It nonetheless has many
interesting features: After the bounce, the interior region asymptotes to an
infinitely expanding Kantowski-Sachs spacetime. If the solution is analytically
continued across the horizon, the black hole exterior exhibits asymptotically
vanishing quantum-corrections due to the polymerization. In all spacetime
dimensions except four, the fall-off is too slow to guarantee invariance under
Poincare transformations in the exterior asymptotic region. Hence the
four-dimensional solution stands out as the only example which satisfies the
criteria for asymptotic flatness. In this case it is possible to calculate the
quantum-corrected temperature and entropy. We also show that polymerization of

measured by Quadri et al 2008. We find that, with robust estimates of the

measured clustering can be well fit within standard halo occupation models, in
contrast to previous results. However, in order to fit the strong break in
w(theta) at theta=10 arcsec, nearly all satellite galaxies in the DRG
luminosity range are required to be DRGs. Within this luminosity-threshold
sample, the fraction of galaxies that are DRGs is ~44%, implying that the
formation of DRGs is more efficient for satellite galaxies than for central
galaxies. Despite the evolved stellar populations contained within DRGs at
z=2.3, 90% of satellite galaxies in the DRG luminosity range have been accreted
within 500 Myr. Thus, satellite DRGs must have known they would become
satellites well before the time of their accretion. This implies that the
formation of DRGs correlates with large-scale environment at fixed halo mass,
although the large-scale bias of DRGs can be well fit without such assumptions.
Further data are required to resolve this issue. Using the observational
estimate that ~30% of DRGs have no ongoing star formation, we infer a timescale
for star formation quenching for satellite galaxies of 450 Myr, although the
uncertainty on this number is large. However, unless all non-star forming
satellite DRGs were quenched before accretion, the quenching timescale is
significantly shorter than z~0 estimates. Down to the completeness limit of the
Quadri et al sample, we find that the halo masses of central DRGs are ~50%
higher than non-DRGs in the same luminosity range, but at the highest halo
masses the central galaxies are DRGs only ~2/3 of the time.

of observed stellar phenomena, such as the surface enhancements of N and He.
However, recent observations have questioned the idea that rotational mixing is
the main process responsible for the surface enhancements, emphasizing the need
for a strong and conclusive test.
  We investigate the consequences of rotational mixing for massive
main-sequence stars in short-period binaries. In these systems the tides spin
up the stars to rapid rotation. We use a state-of-the-art stellar evolution
code including the effect of rotational mixing, tides, and magnetic fields. We
discuss the surface abundances expected in massive close binaries (M1~20 solar
masses) and we propose using such systems to test the concept of rotational
mixing. As these short-period binaries often show eclipses, their parameters
can be determined with high accuracy, allowing for a direct comparison with
binary evolution models.
  In more massive close systems (M1~50 solar masses, Porb<~2 days) we find that
helium is efficiently mixed throughout the envelope. The star remains blue and
compact during the main-sequence phase. It stays within its Roche lobe while it
gradually becomes a helium star. It is the less massive star, in which the
effects of rotational mixing are less pronounced, which fills its Roche lobe
first. We propose that this evolution path provides an alternative channel for
the formation of tight Wolf-Rayet binaries with a main-sequence companion and
might explain massive black hole binaries such as the intriguing system M33
X-7.

involving the same object can occur, which has been suggested to lead to the
formation of an intermediate-mass black hole. In order to verify this scenario
we compute the detailed evolution of the merger remnant of three sequences. We
follow the evolution until the onset of carbon burning and estimate the final
remnant mass to determine the ultimate fate of a runaway merger sequence.
  We use a detailed stellar evolution code to follow the evolution of the
collision product. At each collision, we mix the two colliding stars, taking
account of mass loss during the collision. During the stellar evolution we
apply mass loss rates from the literature, as appropriate for the evolutionary
stage of the merger remnant. We compute models for high ($Z=0.02$) and low
($Z=0.001$) metallicity to quantify metallicity effects.
  We find that the merger remnant becomes a Wolf-Rayet star before the end of
core hydrogen burning. Mass loss from stellar winds dominates over the mass
increase due to repeated mergers for all three merger sequences that we
consider. In none of our high metallicity models an intermediate-mass black
hole is formed, instead our models have a mass of 10--14 \Msun{} at the onset
of carbon burning. For low metallicity we expect the final remnant of the
merger sequence to explode as a pair creation supernova. We find that our
metal-rich models become inflated as a result of developing an extended
low-density envelope. This may increase the probability of further collisions,
but self-consistent $N$-body calculations with detailed evolution of runaway

luminosity (L) of supernova remnants (SNRs) is a strong function of the average
gas surface density (Sigma) of the galaxy in which the remnants reside, from
normal spirals to luminous starbursts. We combine a simple theory for electron
cooling in SNRs with the observed radio luminosities to estimate the remnant
magnetic field strength (B_SNR): the correlation between L and Sigma implies
that B_SNR also increases with Sigma. We explore two interpretations of this
correlation: (1) B_SNR is generated by post-shock magnetic field amplification,
with B_SNR^2 proportional to Sigma and (2) B_SNR results from shock-compression
of the ambient ISM magnetic field (B_ISM), with B_ISM being larger in denser
galaxies. We find that shock compression is, on average, sufficient to produce
the observed radio emission from SNRs in the densest starbursts; amplification
of post-shock magnetic fields is not required. By contrast, in normal spirals
post-shock field amplification (by a factor of a few - 10) is consistent with
the data; we find tentative evidence that both the Alfven speed and the ratio
of B_SNR^2 to the post-shock pressure (""epsilon_B"") are constant in SNRs from
galaxy to galaxy. We discuss observational tests that can be used to
distinguish between these two interpretations of the radio luminosities of
SNRs. Regardless of which is correct, the radio emission from SNRs provides an
upper limit to B_ISM that is independent of the minimum energy assumption. For
the densest starbursts, the ISM magnetic energy density is below that required
for hydrostatic equilibrium; thus magnetic fields are not dynamically important
on the largest scales in starbursts, in contrast with spiral galaxies like our
own. This dichotomy may have implications for galactic dynamo theory.

of classification for AGN activity and show that pollution of nuclear spectra
by host galaxy light leads to a serious misclassification of weak-lined AGN
with increasing redshift. We develop an algorithm to correct for this bias and
show that, for a fixed host luminosity, the misclassification preferentially
affects redder systems, suggesting that lines in these systems are weaker.
After correction for dilution, the sample displays the same fraction of AGN as
in the sensitive Palomar Survey of nearby galaxies (Ho et al.). We demonstrate
that spectroscopically truly passive systems show signatures of X-ray or radio

luminosity of this class. While we confirm that the fraction of AGN with strong
[OIII] emission decreases in denser environments, we show that, including the
faint population of AGN, the fractional abundance of AGN increases with

dust of southern IRDCs. The present paper aims at characterizing the continuuum
properties of this sample of objects. We cross-correlated 1.2 mm continuum data
from SIMBA@SEST with Spitzer/GLIMPSE images to establish the connection between
emission sources at millimeter wavelengths and the IRDCs we see at 8 $\mu$m in
absorption against the bright PAH background. Analysing the dust emission and
extinction leads to a determination of masses and column densities, which are
important quantities in characterizing the initial conditions of massive star
formation. The total masses of the IRDCs were found to range from 150 to 1150
$\rm M_\odot$ (emission data) and from 300 to 1750 $\rm M_\odot$ (extinction
data). We derived peak column densities between 0.9 and 4.6 $\times 10^{22}$
cm$^{-2}$ (emission data) and 2.1 and 5.4 $\times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$
(extinction data). We demonstrate that the extinction method fails for very
high extinction values (and column densities) beyond A$_{\rm V}$ values of
roughly 75 mag according to the Weingartner & Draine (2001) extinction relation
$R_{\rm V} = 5.5$ model B. The derived column densities, taking into account
the spatial resolution effects, are beyond the column density threshold of 3.0
$\times 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ required by theoretical considerations for massive
star formation. We conclude that the values for column densities derived for
the selected IRDC sample make these objects excellent candidates for objects in
the earliest stages of massive star formation.

well-defined outer radius. However, we do not assume that the cloud is in

it as input, and thus avoids possible inconsistencies. It is significantly
easier to fit to observational data than the Bonnor-Ebert sphere. We apply this

theory by taking the (Laplacian) probability as the normalized size of each
subset-event of a finite universe. The analogous step in the logic of
partitions is to assign to a partition the number of distinctions made by a
partition normalized by the total number of ordered pairs |UxU| from the finite
universe. That yields a notion of ""logical entropy"" for partitions and a
""logical information theory."" The logical theory directly counts the
(normalized) number of distinctions in a partition while Shannon's theory gives
the average number of binary partitions needed to make those same distinctions.

optimization when only the marginal probabilities of (binary) random variables
are given, and the correlation between the random variables is unknown. In the
robust model, the objective is to minimize expected cost against worst possible
joint distribution with those marginals. We introduce the concept of
correlation gap to compare this model to the stochastic optimization model that
ignores correlations and minimizes expected cost under independent Bernoulli
distribution. We identify a class of functions, using concepts of summable cost
sharing schemes from game theory, for which the correlation gap is well-bounded
and the robust model can be approximated closely by the independent
distribution model. As a result, we derive efficient approximation factors for
many popular cost functions, like submodular functions, facility location, and
Steiner tree. As a byproduct, our analysis also yields some new results in the
areas of social welfare maximization and existence of Walrasian equilibria,
which may be of independent interest.

and records the thermal history of a cluster. Entropy is therefore a useful
quantity for studying the effects of feedback on the cluster environment and
investigating any breakdown of cluster self-similarity. We find that most ICM
entropy profiles are well-fit by a model which is a power-law at large radii
and approaches a constant value at small radii: K(r) = K0 + K100(r/100 kpc),
where K0 quantifies the typical excess of core entropy above the best fitting
power-law found at larger radii. We also show that the K0 distributions of both
the full archival sample and the primary HIFLUGCS sample of Reiprich (2001) are
bimodal with a distinct gap between K0 ~ 30 - 50 keV cm^2 and population peaks
at K0 ~ 15 keV cm^2 and K0 ~ 150 keV cm^2. The effects of PSF smearing and
angular resolution on best-fit K0 values are investigated using mock Chandra
observations and degraded entropy profiles, respectively. We find that neither
of these effects is sufficient to explain the entropy-profile flattening we
measure at small radii. The influence of profile curvature and number of radial
bins on best-fit K0 is also considered, and we find no indication K0 is
significantly impacted by either. For completeness, we include previously
unpublished optical spectroscopy of Halpha and [N II] emission lines discussed

appears as a single coronal source at one leg of the prominence and it then
splits into a double source. Such a source splitting happens three times, each
coinciding with an increased X-ray flux and plasma temperature, suggestive of
fast reconnection in a localized current sheet and an enhanced energy release
rate. In the late stage of this phase, the prominence displays a helical
structure. These observations are consistent with the tether-cutting and/or
kink instability model for triggering solar eruptions. (2) The eruption of the
prominence takes place during the flare impulsive phase. Since then, there
appear signatures predicted by the classical CSHKP model of two-ribbon flares
occurring in a vertical current sheet trailing an eruption. These signatures
include an EUV cusp and current-sheet-like feature (or ridge) above it. There
is also X-ray emission along the EUV ridge both below and above the cusp, which
in both regions appears closer to the cusp at higher energies in the thermal
regime. This trend is reversed in the nonthermal regime. (3) Spectral analysis
indicates thermal X-rays from all sources throughout the flare, while during
the impulsive phase there is additional nonthermal emission which primarily
comes from the coronal source below the cusp. This source also has a lower
temperature, a higher emission measure, and a much harder nonthermal spectrum
than the upper sources.

techniques enabling the study of the applicability of rule sequences, their
independence, state reachability and the minimal graph able to fire a sequence.
  In the present paper we improve our framework in two ways. First, we make
explicit (in the form of a Boolean matrix) some negative implicit information
in rules. This matrix (called nihilation matrix) contains the elements that, if
present, forbid the application of the rule (i.e. potential dangling edges, or
newly added edges, which cannot be already present in the simple digraph).
Second, we introduce a novel notion of application condition, which combines
graph diagrams together with monadic second order logic. This allows for more
flexibility and expressivity than previous approaches, as well as more concise
conditions in certain cases. We demonstrate that these application conditions
can be embedded into rules (i.e. in the left hand side and the nihilation
matrix), and show that the applicability of a rule with arbitrary application
conditions is equivalent to the applicability of a sequence of plain rules
without application conditions. Therefore, the analysis of the former is
equivalent to the analysis of the latter, showing that in our framework no
additional results are needed for the study of application conditions.
Moreover, all analysis techniques of [21, 22] for the study of sequences can be
applied to application conditions.

Wolf 940. At a distance of 12.50 (+0.75,-0.67) pc, the angular separation of
32arcsec corresponds to a projected separation of 400 AU. The M4 primary
displays no Halpha emission, and we apply the age-activity relations of West et
al. to place a lower limit on the age of the system of 3.5 Gyr. Weak Halpha
absorption suggests some residual activity and we estimate an upper age limit
of 6 Gyr. We apply the relations of Bonfils et al for V-Ks and M_Ks to
determine the metallicity, [Fe/H] = -0.06 +/- 0.20 for Wolf~940A, and by
extension the T8.5 secondary, Wolf 940B. We have obtained JHK NIRI spectroscopy
and JHKL' photometry of Wolf 940B, and use these data, in combination with
theoretical extensions, to determine its bolometric flux, Fbol = 1.75 +/- 0.18
E-16 Wm^-2 and thus its luminosity log(L*/Lsun) = -6.07 +/- 0.04. Using the age
constraints for the system, and evolutionary structural models of Baraffe et
al. we determine Teff = 570 +/- 25K and log g = 4.75-5.00 for Wolf940B, based
on its bolometric luminosity. This represents the first determination of these
properties for a T8+ dwarf that does not rely on the fitting of T-dwarf
spectral models. This object represents the first system containing a T8+ dwarf
for which fiducial constraints on its properties are available, and we compare
its spectra with those of the latest very cool BT-Settl models. This clearly
demonstrates that the use of the (W_J,K/J) spectral ratios (used previously to
constrain Teff and log g) would have over-estimated Teff by ~100K.

with disorder is investigated theoretically by computational and analytical
methods. It is argued that the general phase diagram consists of three
non-equilibrium phases that are determined by the dynamic behavior at the
entrance, at the exit and at the slowest defect bond in the bulk of the system.
Specifically, we consider dynamics of asymmetric exclusion process with two
identical defect bonds as a function of distance between them. Two approximate
theoretical methods, that treat the system as a sequence of segments with exact
description of dynamics inside the segments and neglect correlations between
them, are presented. In addition, a numerical iterative procedure for
calculating dynamic properties of asymmetric exclusion systems is developed.
Our theoretical predictions are compared with extensive Monte Carlo computer
simulations. It is shown that correlations play an important role in the
particle dynamics. When two defect bonds are far away from each other the
strongest correlations are found at these bonds. However, bringing defect bonds
closer leads to the shift of correlations to the region between them.

are enabled by the possibility to engineer many of the characteristic
parameters at will. In cavity QED, the observation of the vacuum Rabi mode
splitting is a hallmark experiment aimed at probing the nature of matter-light
interaction on the level of a single quantum. However, this effect can, at
least in principle, be explained classically as the normal mode splitting of
two coupled linear oscillators. It has been suggested that an observation of
the scaling of the resonant atom-photon coupling strength in the
Jaynes-Cummings energy ladder with the square root of photon number n is
sufficient to prove that the system is quantum mechanical in nature. Here we
report a direct spectroscopic observation of this characteristic quantum
nonlinearity. Measuring the photonic degree of freedom of the coupled system,
our measurements provide unambiguous, long sought for spectroscopic evidence
for the quantum nature of the resonant atom-field interaction in cavity QED. We
explore atom-photon superposition states involving up to two photons, using a
spectroscopic pump and probe technique. The experiments have been performed in
a circuit QED setup, in which ultra strong coupling is realized by the large

mass-loss rates consistent with previous CMFGEN results regarding O8-9V stars
were obtained. A discrepancy of roughly 2 orders of magnitude is found between
these mass-loss rates and the values predicted by theory (Mdot(Vink)),
confirming a breakdown or a steepening of the modified wind momentum-luminosity
relation at log L/Lsun < 5.2. We have estimated the carbon abundance for the
stars of our sample and concluded that its uncertainty cannot cause the weak
wind problem. Upper limits on Mdot were established for all objects using lines
of different ions, namely, PV 1118,28, CIII 1176, NV 1239,43, Si IV 1394,03,
and NIV 1718. All the values obtained are also in disagreement with theoretical
predictions, bringing support to the reality of weak winds. Together with CIV
1549, the use of NV 1239,43 results in the lowest mass-loss rates: the upper
limits indicate that Mdot must be less than about -1.0 dex Mdot(Vink).
Regarding the other transitions, the upper limits still point to low rates:
Mdot must be less than about $(-0.5 \pm 0.2)$ dex Mdot(Vink). We have studied
the behavior of the Halpha line with different mass-loss rates. We have also
explored ways to fit the observed spectra with Mdot(Vink). By using large
amounts of X-rays, we verified that few wind emissions take place, as in weak
winds. However, unrealistic X-rays luminosities had to be used (log Lx/Lbol >
-3.5) (abridged).

for incompressible fluids, which assumes that the turbulence is due to the
bifurcations associated to the velocity field. The theory is formulated using a
representation of the fluid motion which is more general than the classical
Navier-Stokes equations, where the fluid state variables are expressed in terms
of the referential coordinates.
  The theory is developed according to the following four items: 1) Study of
the route toward the turbulence through the bifurcations analysis of the
kinematic equations. 2) Referential description of the motion and calculation
of the velocity fluctuation using the Lyapunov analysis of the local
deformation. 3) Study of the mechanism of the energy cascade from large to
small scales through the Lyapunov analysis of the relative kinematics equations
of motion. 4) Determination of the statistics of the velocity difference with
the Fourier analysis. Each item contributes to the formulation of the theory.
  The theory gives the connection between number of bifurcations, scales and
Reynolds number at the onset of the turbulence and supplies an explanation for
the mechanism of the energy cascade which leads to the closure of the von
K\'arm\'an-Howarth equation. The theory also gives the statistics of the
velocity difference fluctuation and permits the calculation of its PDF.
  The presented results show that the proposed theory describes quite well the
properties of the isotropic turbulence.

type metric having two scale factors $a$ and $R$, corresponding to
$D$-dimensional internal space and 4-dimensional universe, respectively. By
introducing an exotic matter in the form of perfect fluid with an special
equation of state, as the space-time part of the higher dimensional
energy-momentum tensor, a four dimensional effective decaying cosmological term
appears as $\lambda \sim R^{-m}$ with $0 \leq m\leq 2$, playing the role of an
evolving dark energy in the universe. By taking $m=2$, which has some
interesting implications in reconciling observations with inflationary models
and is consistent with quantum tunneling, the resulting Einstein's field
equations yield the exponential solutions for the scale factors $a$ and $R$.
These exponential behaviors may account for the dynamical compactification of
extra dimensions and the accelerating expansion of the 4-dimensional universe
in terms of Hubble parameter, $H$. The acceleration of the universe may be
explained by the negative pressure of the exotic matter. It is shown that the
rate of compactification of higher dimensions as well as expansion of
4-dimensional universe depends on the dimension, $D$. We then obtain the
corresponding Wheeler-DeWitt equation and find the general exact solutions in
$D$-dimensions. A good correspondence between the solutions of classical
Einstein's equations and the solutions of quantum Wheeler-DeWitt equation in
any dimension, $D$, is obtained based on Hartle's point of view concerning the

the wavelength derivative in the Lagrangian equation of radiative transfer is
associated with a generalised opacity. In non-monotonic velocity fields, this
generalised opacity may become negative. To ensure that the opacity remains
positive, this term of the derivative is included in the formal solution of the
radiative transfer problem.
  The new definition of the generalised opacity allows for a new solution of
the equation of radiative transfer in the presence of velocity fields. It is
especially useful for arbitrary velocity fields, where it effectively prevents
the occurrences of negative generalised opacities and still allows the explicit
construction of the Lambda-operator of the system needed for an accelerated
Lambda-iteration. We performed test calculations, where the results of old,
established solutions were compared with the new solution. The relative
deviations never exceeded 1% and so the new solution is indeed suitable for use
in radiative-transfer modelling. Non-monotonic velocity fields along photon
paths frequently occur in three-dimensional hydrodynamical models of
astrophysical atmospheres. Therefore, the formal solution will be of use for
multidimensional radiative transfer and has immediate applications in the
modelling of pulsating stars and astrophysical shock fronts.

double positive feedback loop and an autoregulatory negative feedback loop. The
motif appears in the gene regulatory network controlling the functional
activity of pancreatic $\beta$-cells. The model exhibits bistability and
hysteresis in appropriate parameter regions. The two stable steady states
correspond to low (OFF state) and high (ON state) protein levels respectively.
Using a deterministic approach, we show that the region of bistability
increases in extent when the copy number of one of the genes is reduced from
two to one. The negative feedback loop has the effect of reducing the size of
the bistable region. Loss of a gene copy, brought about by mutations, hampers
the normal functioning of the $\beta$-cells giving rise to the genetic
disorder, maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). The diabetic phenotype
makes its appearance when a sizable fraction of the $\beta$-cells is in the OFF
state. Using stochastic simulation techniques, we show that, on reduction of
the gene copy number, there is a transition from the monostable ON to the ON
state in the bistable region of the parameter space. Fluctuations in the
protein levels, arising due to the stochastic nature of gene expression, can
give rise to transitions between the ON and OFF states. We show that as the
strength of autorepression increases, the ON$\to$OFF state transitions become
less probable whereas the reverse transitions are more probable. The
implications of the results in the context of the occurrence of MODY are
pointed out..

  It is specifically shown that the label's drag coefficient is determined by
its hydrodynamic size, and that the drag per label monomer is largest for
linear labels. However, the addition of side chains to a linear label offers
the possibility to increase the hydrodynamic size, and therefore the label
efficiency, without having to increase the linear length of the label, thereby
simplifying synthesis. The third class of labels investigated, transiently
bound micelles, seems very promising for the usage in ELFSE, as they provide a
significant higher hydrodynamic drag than the other label types.

the efficiency of the ELFSE method can be improved by using smartly designed

expected to form in binaries, and an appreciable fraction of these (as much as
~30%) will evolve into X-ray luminous (L_X~10^38 erg/s) high-mass X-ray
binaries (HMXBs). These sources would have made a contribution to the X-ray
background at z>~6. Using Monte Carlo models of a globular cluster, we estimate
the total X-ray luminosity of a population of HMXBs. We compare and contrast
this with the total UV luminosity of the massive stars during their main
sequence lives. For reasonable estimates, we find that the bolometric
luminosity of the cluster peaks at ~10^42 erg/s during the first few million
years, but declines to ~10^41 erg/s after ~5 million years as the most massive
stars evolve off the main sequence. From this time onwards, the total
bolometric luminosity is dominated by HMXBs and falls gradually to ~10^40 erg/s

the HMXBs, we calculate the effective number of neutral hydrogen ionisations

density of states for different electron crystals in graphene subject to a
strong magnetic field. We investigate both the Wigner crystal and bubble
crystals with M_e electrons per lattice site. The total density of states
consists of several pronounced peaks, the number of which in the negative
energy range coincides with the number of electrons M_e per lattice site, as
for the case of electron-solid phases in the conventional two-dimensional
electron gas. Analyzing the local density of states at the peak energies, we
find particular scaling properties of the density patterns if one fixes the
ratio nu_N/M_e between the filling factor nu_N of the last partially filled
Landau level and the number of electrons per bubble. Although the total density
profile depends explicitly on M_e, the local density of states of the lowest
peaks turns out to be identical regardless the number of electrons M_e. Whereas
these electron-solid phases are reminiscent to those expected in the
conventional two-dimensional electron gas in GaAs heterostructures in the
quantum Hall regime, the local density of states and the scaling relations we
highlight in this paper may be, in graphene, directly measured by spectroscopic
means, such as e.g. scanning tunneling microscopy.

to overcome these bottlenecks by achieving fusion of the quantum chemistry (QC)
approach with DMFT. QC+DMFT supplants the LDA bandstructure by its QC
counterpart as an input to DMFT. Using QC+DMFT, we show that undoped
$La_{2}CuO_{4}$ is a $d$-Mott insulator, and qualitatively discuss the
circulating current- and incoherent metal phase, at small but finite hole
doping. Very good quantitative agreement with experimental photoemission- and
optical spectra constitutes strong support for efficacy of QC+DMFT. Our work
thus opens a new avenue for truly {\it ab-initio} correlation-based approaches
to describe correlated electronic systems in general.

three variations of an SU(3) flavour model with spontaneous CP violation. Such
models explain the hierarchy in the fermion masses and mixings, and predict the
structure of the flavoured soft SUSY breaking terms. In such a situation, both
SUSY flavour and CP problems do not exist. We use electric dipole moments and

progenitor of a long gamma-ray burst (GRB), we develop a two-dimensional
general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) code. We show the code passes
many, well-known test calculations, by which the reliability of the code is
confirmed. Then we perform a numerical simulation of a collapsar using a
realistic progenitor model. It is shown that a jet is launched from the center
of the progenitor. We also find that the mass accretion rate after the launch
of the jet shows rapid time variability that resembles to a typical time
profile of a GRB. The structure of the jet is similar to the previous study: a
poynting flux jet is surrounded by a funnel-wall jet. Even at the final stage
of the simulation, bulk Lorentz factor of the jet is still low, and total
energy of the jet is still as small as 10^48 erg. However, we find that the
energy flux per unit rest-mass flux is as high as 10^2 at the bottom of the
jet. Thus we conclude that the bulk Lorentz factor of the jet can be
potentially high when it propagates outward. It is shown that the outgoing
poynting flux exists at the horizon around the polar region, which proves that
the Blandford-Znajek mechanism is working. However, we conclude that the jet is
launched mainly by the magnetic field amplified by the gravitational collapse
and differential rotation around the black hole, rather than the
Blandford-Znajek mechanism.

consider a typical quantization ambiguity arising from the quantization of the
field strength of the gravitational connection. An alternative Hamiltonian
constraint operator is constructed, which is shown to have the correct
classical limit by the semiclassical analysis. The effective Hamiltonian
incorporating higher order quantum corrections is also obtained. In the
spatially flat FRW model with a massless scalar field, the classical big bang
is again replaced by a quantum bounce. Moreover, there are still great
possibilities for the expanding universe to recollapse due to the quantum
gravity effect. Thus, these key features are robust against this quantization
ambiguity.

initially disordered population homogenizes some traits via local interactions.
The simplest of these models, with wide applications ranging from evolutionary
to social dynamics, are the Voter and Moran processes, usually defined in terms
of static or randomly mixed individuals that interact with a neighbor to copy
or modify a discrete trait. Here we study the effects of diffusion in
Voter/Moran processes by proposing a generalization of ordering dynamics in a
metapopulation framework, in which individuals are endowed with mobility and
diffuse through a spatial structure represented as a graph of patches upon
which interactions take place. We show that diffusion dramatically affects the
time to reach the homogeneous state, independently of the underlying network's
topology, while the final consensus emerges through different local/global
mechanisms, depending on the mobility strength. Our results highlight the
crucial role played by mobility in ordering processes and set up a general
framework that allows to study its effect on a large class of models, with
implications in the understanding of evolutionary and social phenomena.
