  Matters","5 pages, 2 figures. To appear in proceedings of ""Galaxy Evolution:
  Emerging Insights and Future Challenges""",,,,"astro-ph.CO astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The mapping between dark matter halo mass, galaxy stellar mass, and galaxy
cold gas mass is not a simple linear relation, but is influenced by a wide
array of galaxy formation processes. We implement observationally-normalized
relations between dark matter halo mass, stellar mass, and cold gas mass to
explore these mappings, with specific emphasis on the correlation between
different definitions of a major galaxy merger. We always define a major merger
by a mass ratio m/M>0.3, but allow the masses used to compute this ratio to be
defined in one of three ways: dark matter halo masses, galaxy stellar masses,
or galaxy baryonic masses (stars and cold gas). We find that the merger ratio
assigned to any particular merger event depends strongly on which of these
masses is used, with the mapping between different mass ratio definitions
showing strong evolution with halo mass and redshift. For example, major dark
matter mergers (>0.3) in small galaxies (M_DM < 10^11 Msun) typically
correspond to very minor stellar mergers (<1/20). These mergers contain
significant dark matter mass, and should cause noticable morphological
disruption to the primary galaxy, even though there is no observable bright
companion. In massive galaxies, there is an opposite effect, with bright
companion galaxies corresponding to only minor dark matter mergers. We
emphasize that great care must be taken when comparing mergers based on
different mass ratio definitions.

between the finite part of planar six-point MHV amplitudes and hexagon Wilson
loops which has been observed at two loops. At n=6 we confirm that the ABDK/BDS
ansatz must be corrected by adding a remainder function, which depends only on
conformally invariant ratios of kinematic variables. We numerically compute
remainder functions for n=7,8 and verify dual conformal invariance.
Furthermore, we study simple and multiple collinear limits of the Wilson loop
remainder functions and demonstrate that they have precisely the form required
by the collinear factorisation of the corresponding two-loop n-point
amplitudes. The number of distinct diagram topologies contributing to the n-gon
Wilson loops does not increase with n, and there is a fixed number of ""master

polygon Wilson loops, and if the correspondence with amplitudes continues to
hold, all planar n-point two-loop MHV amplitudes in the N=4 theory.

walls of the duct perpendicular to the magnetic field are perfectly conducting
whereas the parallel ones are insulating. In a sufficiently strong magnetic
field, the flow consists of two jets at the insulating walls and a
near-stagnant core. We use a vector stream function formulation and Chebyshev
collocation method to solve the eigenvalue problem for small-amplitude
perturbations. Due to the two-fold reflection symmetry of the base flow the
disturbances with four different parity combinations over the duct
cross-section decouple from each other. Magnetic field renders the flow in a
square duct linearly unstable at the Hartmann number Ha 5.7 with respect to a
disturbance whose vorticity component along the magnetic field is even across
the field and odd along it. For this mode, the minimum of the critical Reynolds
number Re_c 2018, based on the maximal velocity, is attained at Ha ~ 10.
Further increase of the magnetic field stabilises this mode with Re_c growing
approximately as Ha. For Ha>40, the spanwise parity of the most dangerous
disturbance reverses across the magnetic field. At Ha ~ 46 a new pair of most
dangerous disturbances appears with the parity along the magnetic field being
opposite to that of the previous two modes. The critical Reynolds number, which
is very close for both of these modes, attains a minimum Re_c ~ 1130 at Ha ~ 70

discovered a bipolar 12CO outflow in the direction of the line of sight and a
HCO+ clump towards IR1, confirming that it is a YSO. From the detection of the
CS J=7--6 line we infer the presence of high density (>10^7 cm^-3) and warm
(>60 K) gas towards IR1, probably belonging to the protostellar envelope where
the YSO is forming. We investigated the possible genetic connection of IR1 with
the SNR and the HII region. By comparing the dynamical time of the outflows and
the age of the SNR W44, we conclude that the possibility of the SNR has
triggered the formation of IR1 is unlikely. On the other hand, we suggest that
the expansion of the HII region G034.8-0.7 is responsible for the formation of

tendency for SSP-equivalent ages to be biased young means that archaeological
downsizing overstates the mass-weighted downsizing in age with mass. We find
that the SSP-equivalent metallicity closely tracks the mass- and light-weighted

closely reflect the underlying trends. We construct mock catalogues of
early-type galaxies in a Coma cluster-sized halo and compare them directly to
observations of early-type galaxies in the Coma cluster. The similarity of the
SSP-equivalent ages in the observational samples and the mock catalogues gives
us confidence that the star-formation quenching implemented in the hierarchical
galaxy formation model produces roughly the correct amount of recent star
formation. The SSP-equivalent metallicities are however too low and have the
wrong slope as a function of velocity dispersion, and the SSP-equivalent ages

populations of three nearby, old elliptical galaxies: NGC 3379, NGC 4278, and
NGC 4697. With a cumulative ~1 Ms Chandra ACIS observing time, we detect 90-170
LMXBs within the D25 ellipse of each galaxy. Cross-correlating Chandra X-ray
sources and HST optical sources, we identify 75 globular cluster (GC) LMXBs and
112 field LMXBs. In the low luminosity range allowed by our deeper data (LX < 5
x 1037 erg s-1), we find a significant relative lack of GC-LMXBs, when compared
with field sources. Using the co-added sample from the three galaxies, we find
that the incompleteness-corrected X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) of GC and
field LMXBs differ at ~4# significance at LX < 5 x 1037 erg s-1. As previously
reported, these XLFs are consistent at higher luminosities. Our observations
may indicate a potential predominance of GC-LMXBs with donors evolved beyond
the main sequence, when compared to current models, but their efficient
formation requires relatively high initial binary fractions in clusters. The
field LMXB XLF can be fitted with either a single power-law model plus a
localized excess at a luminosity of 5-6 x 1037 erg s-1, or a broken power-law
with a similar low-luminosity break. This XLF may be explained with
NS-red-giant LMXBs, contributing to ~15% of total LMXBs population at ~5x1037
erg s-1. The difference in the GC and field XLFs is consistent with different
origins and/or evolutionary paths between the two LMXB populations, although a
fraction of the field sources are likely to have originated in GCs.

emission from three OH/IR stars close to the Galactic centre. The intention was
to find out whether it would be possible to conduct a large-scale survey for
mass-loss rates using, for example, the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA).
Such a survey would increase our understanding of the evolution of the Galactic
bulge.
  Methods: Two millimetre-wave instruments were used: the Nobeyama Millimeter
Array at 115 GHz and the Submillimeter Array at 230 GHz. An interferometer is
necessary as a `spatial filter' in this region of space because of the
confusion with interstellar CO emission.
  Results: Towards two of the stars, CO emission was detected with positions
and radial velocities coinciding within the statistical errors with the
corresponding data of the associated OH sources. However, for one of the stars
the line profile is not what one expects for an unresolved expanding
circumstellar envelope. We believe that this CO envelope is partially resolved
and that this star therefore is a foreground star not belonging to the bulge.
  Conclusions: The results of the observations have shown that it is possible
to detect line profiles of circumstellar CO from late-type stars both within
and in the direction of the Galactic bulge. ALMA will be able to detect CO
emission in short integrations with sensitivity sufficient to estimate
mass-loss rates from a large number of such stars.

the electromagnetic form factor of a pseudoscalar meson for space-like momentum
transfers. The elastic scattering of an electron by a confined quark-antiquark
pair is treated as a relativistic two-channel problem for the $q\bar{q}e$ and
$q\bar{q}e\gamma$ states. With the approximation that the total velocity of the
$q\bar{q}e$ system is conserved at (electromagnetic) interaction vertices this
simplifies to an eigenvalue problem for a Bakamjian-Thomas type mass operator.
After elimination of the $q\bar{q}e\gamma$ channel the electromagnetic meson
current and form factor can be directly read off from the one-photon-exchange
optical potential. By choosing the invariant mass of the electron-meson system
large enough, cluster separability violations become negligible. An equivalence
with the usual front-form expression, resulting from a spectator current in the
$q^+=0$ reference frame, is established. The generalization of this
multichannel approach to electroweak form factors for an arbitrary bound
few-body system is quite obvious. By an appropriate extension of the Hilbert
space this approach is also able to accommodate exchange-current effects.

motivated by the black hole information paradox where one appears to have pure

between conservation laws and locality can be circumvented by constructing a
relational theory of information destruction. In terms of conservation laws, we
derive a generalisation of Noether's theorem for general theories, and show
that symmetries imply a strong restriction on the type of evolution
permissable. With respect to locality, we distinguish violations of causality
from the creation or destruction of space-like seperated correlations. We show
that violations of causality need not occur in a relational framework, although
one can have situations where correlations decay faster than one might
otherwise expect or can be created over spatial distances. This creation or
destruction of correlations cannot be used to signal superluminally, and thus
no violation of causality occurs. We prove that theories with information
destruction can be made time-symmetric, thus impossing no arrow of time.

demonstrated by Terashima and Ueda \cite{TU2}, where the degree of violation of
the Bell inequality is dependent of the angle of the Wigner rotation. This
geometrical approach to study the relativistic EPR correlations is a promissing

  Constraints Combine",,,,,"math.OC cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we study the problem of recovering sparse or compressible
signals from uniformly quantized measurements. We present a new class of convex
optimization programs, or decoders, coined Basis Pursuit DeQuantizer of moment
$p$ (BPDQ$_p$), that model the quantization distortion more faithfully than the
commonly used Basis Pursuit DeNoise (BPDN) program. Our decoders proceed by
minimizing the sparsity of the signal to be reconstructed subject to a
data-fidelity constraint expressed in the $\ell_p$-norm of the residual error
for $2\leq p\leq \infty$.
  We show theoretically that, (i) the reconstruction error of these new
decoders is bounded if the sensing matrix satisfies an extended Restricted
Isometry Property involving the $\ell_p$ norm, and (ii), for Gaussian random
matrices and uniformly quantized measurements, BPDQ$_p$ performance exceeds
that of BPDN by dividing the reconstruction error due to quantization by
$\sqrt{p+1}$. This last effect happens with high probability when the number of
measurements exceeds a value growing with $p$, i.e. in an oversampled situation
compared to what is commonly required by BPDN = BPDQ$_2$. To demonstrate the
theoretical power of BPDQ$_p$, we report numerical simulations on signal and
image reconstruction problems.

small-scale magnetic fields such as those produced by streaming Weibel-type

present a comprehensive study of the dependence of the jitter radiation spectra
on the properties of, in general, anisotropic magnetic turbulence. We have
obtained that the radiation spectra do reflect, to some extent, properties of
the magnetic field spatial distribution, yet the radiation field is anisotropic
and sensitive to the viewing direction with respect to the field anisotropy
direction. We explore the parameter space of the magnetic field distribution
and its effect on the radiation spectrum. Some important results include: the
presence of the harder-than-synchrotron segment below the peak frequency at
some viewing angles, the presence of the high-frequency power-law tail even for
a monoenergetic distribution of electrons, the dependence of the peak frequency
on the field correlation length rather than the field strength, the strong
correlation of the spectral parameters with the viewing angle. In general, we
have found that even relatively minor changes in the magnetic field properties
can produce very significant effects upon the jitter radiation spectra. We
consider these results to be important for accurate interpretation of prompt
gamma-ray burst spectra and possibly other sources.

nucleosynthesis over cosmic history? Was significant energy released by
non-stellar processes? Is there a diffuse component to the EBL anywhere from
optical to sub-millimeter? When did first stars appear and how luminous was the
reionization epoch? Absolute optical to mid-IR EBL spectrum to an
astrophysically interesting accuracy can be established by wide field imagingat

while the clusters themselves are ideal testbeds in which to study the
predictions of stellar evolutionary theory. To this end, we present a study of
the RSGs' surface abundances using a combination of high-resolution H-band
spectroscopy and spectral synthesis analysis. We provide abundance measurements
for elements C, O, Si, Mg, Ti, and Fe. We find that the surface abundances of
the stars studied are consistent with CNO burning and deep, rotationally
enhanced mixing. The average a/Fe ratios of the clusters are solar, consistent
with a thin-disk population. However, we find significantly sub-solar Fe/H
ratios for each cluster, a result which strongly contradicts a simple
extrapolation of the Galactic metallicity gradient to lower Galacto-centric
distances. We suggest that a simple one-dimensional parameterization of the
Galaxy's abundance patterns is insufficient at low Galactocentric distances, as
large azimuthal variations may be present. Indeed, we show that the abundances
of O, Si and Mg are consistent with independent measurements of objects in
similar locations in the Galaxy. In combining our results with other data in
the literature, we present evidence for large-scale (~kpc) azimuthal variations
in abundances at Galacto-centric distances of 3-5kpc. While we cannot rule-out
that this observed behaviour is due to systematic offsets between different
measurement techniques, we do find evidence for similar behaviour in a study of
the barred-spiral galaxy NGC4736 which uses homogeneous methodology. We suggest
that these azimuthal abundance variations could result from the intense but
patchy star formation driven by the potential of the central bar.

models and perform a ray-tracing of photons (in the Kerr geometry) to calculate
the observed disk spectra. Previously, it was a common practice to ray-trace
photons assuming that they are emitted from the Kerr geometry equatorial plane,
z = 0. We show that the spectra calculated with this assumption differ from
these calculated under the assumption that photons are emitted from the actual
surface of the disc, z = H(r). This implies that a knowledge of the location of
the thin disks effective photosphere is relevant for calculating the spectra.
In this paper we investigate, in terms of a simple toy model, a possible
influence of the (unknown, and therefore ad hoc assumed) vertical dissipation
profiles on the vertical structure of the disk and thus on the location of the
effective photosphere, and on the observed spectra. For disks with moderate and
high mass accretion rates (\dot m>0.01\dot m_C) we find that the photosphere
location in the inner, radiation pressure dominated, disk region (where most of
the radiation comes from) does not depend on the dissipation profile and
therefore emerging disk spectra are insensitive to the choice of the
dissipation function. For lower accretion rates the photosphere location
depends on the assumed vertical dissipation profile down to the disk inner
edge, but the dependence is very weak and thus of minor importance. We conclude
that the spectra of optically thick accretion disks around black holes should
be calculated with the ray-tracing from the effective photosphere and that,
fortunately, the choice of a particular vertical dissipation profile does not
substantially influence the calculated spectrum.

the Kennicutt-Schmidt star formation law, is log(G_{HI}/S) = -1.73238(g-r) +
0.215182mu_i - 4.08451, where mu_i is the i-band surface brighteness and g-r is

compared to sigma ~ 0.4 dex for previous estimators that were based on colour
alone. We investigate whether the residuals in our estimate of log(G_{HI}/S)

no effect as a function of stellar mass or 4000A break strength, but there is a
systematic effect as a function of the concentration index of the light. We
then apply our estimator to a sample of 10^5 emission-line galaxies in the SDSS

agreement with recent results from H I blind surveys. Finally, we re-examine
the well-known relation between gas-phase metallicity and stellar mass and ask
whether there is a dependence on H I-to-stellar mass ratio, as predicted by
chemical evolution models. We do find that gas-poor galaxies are more metal
rich at fixed stellar mass. We compare our results with the semi-analytic

hydrodynamic simulation of a GRB outflow during the afterglow phase, which uses
the fifth-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory scheme and adaptive mesh
refinement. Initially, the jet has a Lorentz factor of 20. We have followed its
evolution up to 150 years. Using the hydrodynamic data, we calculate
synchrotron radiation based upon standard afterglow models and compare our
results with previous analytic work. We find that the sideways expansion of a
relativistic GRB jet is a very slow process and previous analytic works have
overestimated its rate. In our computed lightcurves, a very sharp jet break is
seen and the post-break lightcurves are steeper than analytic predictions. We
find that the jet break in GRB afterglow lightcurves is mainly caused by the
missing flux when the edge of the jet is observed. The outflow becomes
nonrelativistic at the end of the Blandford-McKee phase. But it is still highly
nonspherical, and it takes a rather long time for it to become a spherical
Sedov-von Neumann-Taylor blast wave. We find that the late-time afterglows
become increasingly flatter over time. But we disagree with the common notion
that there is a sudden flattening in lightcurves due to the transition into the
Sedov-von Neumann-Taylor solution. We have also found that there is a bump in
lightcurves at very late times ($\sim 1000$ days) due to radiation from the

Four of the X-ray sources have previously been identified as compact accreting
binaries in the cluster--three cataclysmic variables (CVs) and one quiescent
neutron star. Correlating the Chandra positions with known variable stars
yields eight matches, of which five are probable cluster members that are
likely to be binary stars with active coronae. Extrapolating these optical
identifications to the remaining unidentified X-ray source population, we
estimate that 20-35 of the sources are CVs and a similar number are active
binaries. This likely represents most of the CVs in the cluster, but only a
small fraction of all the active binaries. We place a 2-sigma upper limit of Lx
< 3x10^30 erg/s on the integrated luminosity of any additional faint,
unresolved population of sources in the core. We explore the significance of
these findings in the context of primordial vs. dynamical channels for CV
formation. The number of CVs per unit mass in Omega Cen is at least 2-3 times
lower than in the field, suggesting that primordial binaries that would
otherwise lead to CVs are being destroyed in the cluster environment.

are used to study sizes, SFRs, morphologies, gas-phase metallicities, gas
fractions and effective yields. Optical, near-IR and Spitzer/IRAC photometry is
used to measure stellar mass. We obtain that morphologies are usually complex,
with the presence of several peaks of emissions and companions that are not
detected in broad-band images. Typical metallicities are 10-50% solar, with a
strong evolution of the mass-metallicity relation from lower redshifts. Stellar
masses, gas fraction, and evolutionary stages vary significantly among the
galaxies, with less massive galaxies showing larger fractions of gas. In
contrast with observations in the local universe, effective yields decrease
with stellar mass and reach solar values at the low-mass end of the sample.
This effect can be reproduced by gas infall with rates of the order of the
SFRs. Outflows are present but are not needed to explain the mass-metallicity
relation. We conclude that a large fraction of these galaxies are actively
creating stars after major episodes of gas infall or merging.

bounds for a number of key problems in the data stream model. In this problem,
Alice and Bob have to decide whether the Hamming distance between their $n$-bit
input strings is large (i.e., at least $n/2 + \sqrt n$) or small (i.e., at most
$n/2 - \sqrt n$); they do not care if it is neither large nor small. This
$\Theta(\sqrt n)$ gap in the problem specification is crucial for capturing the
approximation allowed to a data stream algorithm.
  Thus far, for randomized communication, an $\Omega(n)$ lower bound on this
problem was known only in the one-way setting. We prove an $\Omega(n)$ lower
bound for randomized protocols that use any constant number of rounds.
  As a consequence we conclude, for instance, that $\epsilon$-approximately
counting the number of distinct elements in a data stream requires
$\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ space, even with multiple (a constant number of) passes
over the input stream. This extends earlier one-pass lower bounds, answering a
long-standing open question. We obtain similar results for approximating the
frequency moments and for approximating the empirical entropy of a data stream.
  In the process, we also obtain tight $n - \Theta(\sqrt{n}\log n)$ lower and
upper bounds on the one-way deterministic communication complexity of the
problem. Finally, we give a simple combinatorial proof of an $\Omega(n)$ lower
bound on the one-way randomized communication complexity.

interactions in the cytoplasm. The model organisms contain replication
controlling genes (DCGs) and genes modeling the mismatch repair (MMR)

landscape. The microscopic pathway of adaptation follows a well-defined set of
events: stochastic switching to the mutator phenotype first, then mutation in
the MMR complex that hitchhikes with a beneficial mutation in the DCGs, and
finally a compensating mutation in the MMR complex returning the population to
a non-mutator phenotype. Similarity of these results to reported adaptation

Great Annihilator is known to be near a small, bright molecular cloud on the
sky in a region largely devoid of emission in 12-CO surveys of the Galactic
Center. The region is of interest because it is interior to the dust lanes
which may be the shock zones where atomic gas from HI nuclear disk is converted
into molecular gas. We find that the region is populated with a number of dense
(n ~ 10^5 cm^-3) regions of excited gas with small filling factors, and
estimate that up to 1-3 x 10^5 solar masses of gas can be seen in our maps. The
detection suggests that a significant amount of mass is transported from the
shock zones to the GC star-forming regions in the form of small, dense bundles.

the observed surface brightness distribution and the central velocity

extracted by deprojecting the measured brightness distribution and scaling it
by a fiduciary, step-function shaped, $raw$ mass-to-light ratio profile

source HW2 drives a pulsed, precessing jet that has changed its orientation by
about 45 degrees in roughly 104 years. The current HW2 radio jet represents the
most recent event in this time series of eruptions. This scenario is consistent
with the recent discovery of a disk around HW2, perpendicular to the current
jet orientation, and with the presence of companions at projected distances
comparable to the disk radius. We propose that the Cep A system formed by the
disk-assisted capture of a sibling star by HW2. We present a numerical model of
a 15 M_sun star with a circumstellar disk, orbited by a companion in an
inclined, eccentric orbit. Close passages of the companion through or near the
disk result in periods of enhanced accretion and mass loss, as well as forced
precession of the disk and associated orientation changes in the jet. The
observations reveal a second powerful outflow that emerges from radio source
HW3c or HW3d. This flow is associated with blueshifted CO emission and a faint
H2 bow shock to the east, and with HH 168 to the west. A collision between the
flows from HW2 and HW3c/d may be responsible for X-ray and radio continuum

hard GRBs. They could have been recognized by BATSE as short/hard GRBs should
they have occurred at z <= 1. We perform a more thorough investigation on two
physically distinct types (Type I/II) of cosmological GRBs and their
observational characteristics. We reiterate the definitions of Type I/II GRBs
and review the observational criteria and their physical motivations. Contrary
to the traditional approach of assigning the physical category based on the
gamma-ray properties (duration, hardness, and spectral lag), we take an
alternative approach to define the Type I and Type II Gold Samples using
several criteria that are more directly related to the GRB progenitors, and
study the properties of the two Gold Samples and compare them with the
traditional long/soft and short/hard samples. We find that the Type II Gold
Sample reasonably tracks the long/soft population, although it includes several
intrinsically short (shorter than 1s in the rest frame) GRBs. The Type I Gold
Sample only has 5 GRBs, 4 of which are not strictly short but have extended
emission. Other short/hard GRBs detected in the Swift era represent the BATSE
short/hard sample well, but it is unclear whether all of them belong to Type I.
We suggest that some (probably even most) high-luminosity short/hard GRBs
instead belong to Type II. We suggest that GRB 080913 and GRB 090423 are more
likely Type II events. We re-emphasize the importance of invoking multiple
observational criteria, and cautiously propose an operational procedure to
infer the physical origin of a given GRB with available multiple observational
criteria, with various caveats laid out.

markets for contingent claims. Hanson introduced a market maker derived from
the logarithmic scoring rule, and later Chen and Pennock developed a cost
function formulation for the market maker. On the other hand, the SCPM model of
Peters et al. is based on ideas from a call auction setting using a convex
optimization model. In this work, we develop a unified framework that bridges
these seemingly unrelated models for centrally organizing contingent claim
markets. The framework, developed as a generalization of the SCPM, will support
many desirable properties such as proper scoring, truthful bidding (in a myopic
sense), efficient computation, and guarantees on worst case loss. In fact, our
unified framework will allow us to express various proper scoring rules,
existing or new, from classical utility functions in a convex optimization
problem representing the market organizer. Additionally, we utilize concepts
from duality to show that the market model is equivalent to a risk minimization
problem where a convex risk measure is employed. This will allow us to more
clearly understand the differences in the risk attitudes adopted by various
mechanisms, and particularly deepen our intuition about popular mechanisms like
Hanson's market-maker. In aggregate, we believe this work advances our
understanding of the objectives that the market organizer is optimizing in
popular pari-mutuel mechanisms by recasting them into one unified framework.

monochromatic electron spectrum is transformed due to a photon emission and
fluctuations of energy loss in a target. The selection criterion of $\mu \to e
(\gamma)$ conversion events is an electron momentum above the threshold
momentum of 103.5 MeV/c, which corresponds to the maximum energy loss of 1.5
MeV. Radiative corrections including a virtual photon correction and soft
photon emission below 1.5 MeV lead to a reduction by about 10% in the
probability of $\mu \to e $ conversion process calculated without radiative
corrections.
  The soft photons emission below 1.5 MeV contributes to a change of electron
spectrum from monoenergetic one at 105 MeV to a spectrum with a low energy tail
for the process of $\mu \to e (\gamma)$ conversion. However the effect of
smearing of the initial momentum distribution due to the soft photon emission

compensated for the delays between the antennas of our platform-mounted

the path to be equipped with instruments capable to combine between four to six
telescopes. In the framework of the VLTI second generation instruments Gravity
and VSI, we propose a new beam combining concept using Integrated Optics (IO)
technologies with a novel ABCD-like fringe encoding scheme. Our goal is to
demonstrate that IO-based combination brings considerable advantages in terms
of instrumental design and performance. We therefore aim at giving a full
characterization of an IO beam combiner to establish its performances and check
its compliance with the specifications of an imaging instrument. Laboratory
measurements were made in the H band with a dedicated testbed. We studied the
beam combiners through the analysis of throughput, instrumental visibilities,
phases and closure phases in wide band as well as with spectral dispersion.
Study of the polarization properties is also done. We obtain competitive
throughput, high and stable instrumental contrasts, stable but non-zero closure
phases which we attribute to internal well calibrable optical path differences.
We validate a new static and achromatic phase shifting IO function close to the
nominal 90deg value. All these observables show limited chromaticity over the H
band range. Our results demonstrate that such ABCD-like beam combiners are
particularly well suited to achieve aperture synthesis imaging. This opens the
way to extend to all near infrared wavelengths and in particular, the K band.

simulating strongly-correlated electronic systems in optical lattices. It may
shed light on some long-standing puzzles in condensed-matter physics, like the
nature of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates that had baffled
people over two decades. It is believed that the two-dimensional fermionic
Hubbard model, or t-J model, contains the key to this problem; but the
difficulty of unveiling the mystery of a strongly-interacting fermionic system
is also generally acknowledged. Here, as a substitute, we systematically
analyze the property of bosonic t-J model simulated in optical superlattices
near unit-filling. In particular, we show the emergence of a strange
topological Fermi liquid with Fermi surfaces from a purely bosonic system. We
also discuss the possibility of observing these phenomena in ultracold atom
experiments. The result may provide some crucial insights into the origin of
high-T_{c} superconductivity.

achievements always spring to mind. But, his Number-Theoretical achievements
(See Books 7, 8 and 9 in his magnum opus \emph{Elements} [1]) are rarely
spoken. The object of this paper is to affirm the number-theoretical role of
Euclid and the historical significance of Euclid's algorithm. It is known that
almost all elementary number-theoretical texts begin with Division algorithm.
However, Euclid did not do like this. He began his number-theoretical work by
introducing his algorithm. We were quite surprised when we began to read the
\emph{Elements} for the first time. Nevertheless, one can prove that Euclid's
algorithm is essentially equivalent with the Bezout's equation and Division
algorithm. Therefore, Euclid has preliminarily established Theory of
Divisibility and the greatest common divisor. This is the foundation of Number
Theory. After more than 2000 years, by creatively introducing the notion of
congruence, Gauss published his \emph{Disquisitiones Arithmeticae} in 1801 and
developed Number Theory as a systematic science. Note also that Euclid's
algorithm implies Euclid's first theorem (which is the heart of `the uniqueness
part' of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic) and Euclid's second theorem
(which states that there are infinitely many primes). Thus, in the nature of
things, Euclid's algorithm is the most important number-theoretical work of
Euclid. For this reason, we further summarize briefly the influence of Euclid's
algorithm. Knuth said `we might call Euclid's method the granddaddy of all
algorithms'. Based on our discussion and analysis, it leads to the conclusion
Euclid's algorithm is the greatest number-theoretical achievement of the
Euclidean age.
