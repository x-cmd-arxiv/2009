explaining the galactic positron excess observed by PAMELA/HEAT and
ATIC/PPB-BETS: One is the conventional (bino-like) lightest supersymmetric
particle (LSP) \chi, and the other is a TeV scale meta-stable neutral singlet
N_D, which is a Dirac fermion (N,N^c). In this model, N_D decays dominantly
into \chi e^+e^- through an R parity preserving dimension 6 operator with the
life time \tau_N\sim 10^{26} sec. We introduce a pair of vector-like superheavy
SU(2) lepton doublets (L,L^c) and lepton singlets (E,E^c). The dimension 6
operator leading to the N_D decay is generated from the leptophilic Yukawa
interactions by W\supset Ne^cE+Lh_dE^c+m_{3/2}l_1L^c with the dimensionless
couplings of order unity, and the gauge interaction by {\cal L}\supset \sqrt{2}
g'\tilde{e}^{c*}e^c\chi + h.c. The superheavy masses of the vector-like leptons
(M_L, M_E\sim 10^{16} GeV) are responsible for the longevity of N_D. The low
energy field spectrum in this model is just the MSSM fields and N_D. Even for
the case that the portion of N_D is much smaller than that of \chi in the total
DM density [{\cal O}(10^{-10}) \lesssim n_{N_D}/n_\chi], the observed positron
excess can be explained by adopting relatively lighter masses of the
vector-like leptons (10^{13} GeV \lesssim M_{L,E} \lesssim 10^{16} GeV). The
smallness of the electron mass is also explained. This model is easily embedded
in the flipped SU(5) grand unification, which is a leptophilic unified theory.

at RHIC have opened a rich field for parton energy loss analysis in heavy-ion
collisions. Recently, a considerable amount of work has beendevoted to study
the shapes of the ``away-side'' jet which exhibit an interesting and unexpected
``double hump'' structure not observed in the analogous treatment of $pp$ data.
Driven by the possibility that the latter result might just mean that such
structure exists already in the case of $pp$ collisions, but that its relative
intensity could be small, here we use the Event Shape Analysis to show that it
is possible to identify and select well defined event topologies in $pp$
collisions, among which, a double hump structure for the away-side jet emerges.
Using two shape parameters, the sphericity in the transverse plane and the
recoil to analyze a sample of PYTHIA generated $pp$ collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV, we show that this structure corresponds to two jets
emitted in the backward hemisphere. Finally, we show that Q-PYTHIA
qualitatively reproduces the decrease in the yield of dijet events and the
increase of the double hump structure in the away side observed in heavy ion
collisions. The implications for the treatment of parton energy loss in
heavy-ion collisions are discussed

Analytical expressions for the shape, moments and some other basic statistical
properties are given. Furthermore, several well-known econometric tools for
measuring inequality, which all exist in a closed form, are considered. A
method for parameter estimation is also discussed. The model is shown to fit
remarkably well the data on personal income for the United States, and the
analysis of inequality performed in terms of its parameters reveals very
powerful.

observed from 10-36 microns at relatively high spectral resolution, R~600. The
sample was chosen because they all gave some evidence in the visible of a
carbon-rich chemistry. All seven of the sources show the broad, unidentified 21
micron emission feature; three of them are new detections (IRAS 06530-0213,
07430+1115, and 19477+2401) and the others are observed at higher S/N than in
previous spectra. These have the same shape and central wavelength (20.1
microns) as found in the ISO spectra of the brighter PPNs. The 30 micron
feature was seen in all seven objects. However, it is not resolved into two
separate features (26 and 33 microns) as was claimed on the basis of ISO
spectra, which presumably suffered from the noisy detector bands in this
region. All showed the infrared aromatic bands (AIB) at 11.3, 12.4, and 13.3
microns. Five of these also appear to have the C2H2 molecular band at 13.7
microns, one in absorption and four in emission. This is extremely rare, with
only one other evolved star, IRC+10216, in which C2H2 emission has been
observed. Four also possessed a broad, unidentified emission feature at 15.8
microns that may possibly be related to the 21 micron feature. Model fits were
made to the spectral energy distributions for these PPNs to determine
properties of the detached circumstellar envelopes. The 21 micron feature has
been seen in all Galactic carbon-rich PPNs observed, and thus its carrier
appears to be a common component of the outflow around these objects.

placement of the states with different orbital angular momentum ${\it l}$,

reality, which we call the reality game. It is a game of chance in which the
probabilities for different objective outcomes (e.g., heads or tails in a coin
toss) depend on the amount wagered on those outcomes. By varying the `reality
map', which relates the amount wagered to the probability of the outcome, it is
possible to move continuously from a purely objective game in which
probabilities have no dependence on wagers to a purely subjective game in which
probabilities equal the amount wagered. We study self-reinforcing games, in
which betting more on an outcome increases its odds, and self-defeating games,
in which the opposite is true. This is investigated in and out of equilibrium,
with and without rational players, and both numerically and analytically. We
introduce a method of measuring the inefficiency of the game, similar to
measuring the magnitude of the arbitrage opportunities in a financial market.
We prove that convergence to equilibrium is is a power law with an extremely
slow rate of convergence: The more subjective the game, the slower the
convergence.

applications. Most of the properties that could not be derived or defined for

algebra of type II which is introduced in this book. In case of n-linear
algebra of type II we are in a position to define linear functionals which is
one of the marked difference between the n-vector spaces of type I and II.
However all the applications mentioned in n-linear algebras of type I can be
appropriately extended to n-linear algebras of type II. Another use of n-linear
algebra (n-vector spaces) of type II is that when this structure is used in
coding theory we can have different types of codes built over different finite
fields whereas this is not possible in the case of n-vector spaces of type I.
Finally in the case of n-vector spaces of type II, we can obtain n-eigen values
from distinct fields; hence, the n-characteristic polynomials formed in them
are in distinct different fields.
  An attractive feature of this book is that the authors have suggested 120
problems for the reader to pursue in order to understand this new notion. This
book has three chapters. In the first chapter the notion of n-vector spaces of
type II are introduced. This chapter gives over 50 theorems. Chapter two
introduces the notion of n-inner product vector spaces of type II, n-bilinear
forms and n-linear functionals. The final chapter suggests over a hundred
problems. It is important that the reader is well-versed not only with linear
algebra but also n-linear algebra of type I.

many astrophysical phenomena such as the core collapse of massive stars.

galaxy UGC7388 with the 8.1-m Gemini North telescope. Judging by its observed
characteristics, UGC7388 is a giant late-type spiral galaxy seen almost
edge-on. The main body of the galaxy is surrounded by two faint (\mu(B) ~ 24
and \mu(B) ~ 25.5) extended (~20-30 kpc) loop-like structures. A large-scale
rotation of the brighter loop about the main galaxy has been detected. We
discuss the assumption that the tidal disruption of a relatively massive
companion is observed in the case of UGC7388. A detailed study and modeling of
the observed structure of this unique galaxy can give important information
about the influence of the absorption of massive companions on the galactic
disks and about the structure of the dark halo around UGC7388.

  systems with quadratic integrals of motion","21 pages, Detailed version of the talk given at the XXVII Colloquium
  on Group Theoretical Methods in Physics, Yerevan, Armenia, Aug. 2008",,,,"math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The three dimensional superintegrable systems with quadratic integrals of
motion have five functionally independent integrals, one among them is the
Hamiltonian. Kalnins, Kress and Miller have proved that in the case of non
degenerate potentials there is a sixth quadratic integral, which is linearly
independent of the other integrals. The existence of this sixth integral imply
that the integrals of motion form a ternary {parafermionic-like} quadratic
Poisson algebra with five generators. We show that in all the non degenerate
cases (with one exception) there are at least two subalgebras of three
integrals having a Poisson quadratic algebra structure, which is similar to the
two dimensional case.

  2008",,,,"math.CO math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the last decade it became apparent that a large number of the most
interesting structures and phenomena of the world can be described by networks:
separable elements, with connections (or interactions) between certain pairs of
them.
  These huge networks pose exciting challenges for the mathematician. Graph
Theory (the mathematical theory of networks) faces novel, unconventional
problems: these very large networks (like the Internet) are never completely
known, in most cases they are not even well defined. Data about them can be
collected only by indirect means like random local sampling.
  Dense networks (in which a node is adjacent to a positive percent of others
nodes) and sparse networks (in which a node has a bounded number of neighbors)
show very different behavior. From a practical point of view, sparse networks
are more important, but at present we have more complete theoretical results
for dense networks. The paper surveys relations with probability, algebra,
extrema graph theory, and analysis.
