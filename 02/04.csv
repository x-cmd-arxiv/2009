antiferromagnet is governed by an Abelian Higgs model in $d=2+1$ spacetime
dimensions featuring $N$ complex scalar fields. In this context, we derive for
$2\leq d\leq 4$ an exact formula for the central charge of the U(1) current in
terms of the gauge coupling at quantum criticality and compare it with the
corresponding result obtained using gauge-gravity duality. There is a
remarkable similarity precisely for $d=2+1$. In this case the amplitude of the
current correlation function has the same form as predicted by the
gauge-gravity duality. We also compare finite temperature results for the
charge susceptibility in the large $N$ limit with the result predicted by the
gauge-gravity duality. Our results suggest that condensed matter systems at
quantum criticality may provide interesting quantitative tests of the
gauge-gravity duality even in absence of supersymmetry.

first derive the classical dynamics describing the physical fluctuations in a
wide class of models incorporating gravity, non-Abelian gauge fields, the
dilaton and two-form potential, as well as 3-brane sources. Next, we use these
results to study braneworld compactifications in 6D supergravity, focusing on
the bosonic fields in the minimal model; composed of the supergravity-tensor
multiplet and the U(1) gauge multiplet whose flux supports the
compactification. For unwarped models sourced by positive tension branes, a
harmonic analysis allows us to solve the large, coupled, differential system
completely and obtain the full 4D spin-2,1 and 0 particle spectra, establishing
(marginal) stability and a qualitative behaviour similar to the smooth sphere
compactification. We also find interesting results for models with negative
tension branes; extra massless Kaluza-Klein vector fields can appear in the
spectra, beyond those expected from the isometries in the internal space. These
fields imply an enhanced gauge symmetry in the low energy 4D effective theory
obtained by truncating to the massless sector, which is explicitly broken as
higher modes are excited, until the full 6D symmetries are restored far above
the Kaluza-Klein scale. Remarkably, the low energy effective theory does not
seem to distinguish between a compactification on a smooth sphere and these
singular, deformed spheres.

bands, is commonly used to derive the chemical composition of protoplanetary
dust. Different analysis methods have been proposed for this purpose, but so
far, no comparative test has been performed to test their validity. We
calculated model spectra of disk models with different geometries and central
sources, using a 2D radiative transfer code. These spectra were then fitted in
a blind test using four different spectral decomposition methods. We studied
the effect of disk structure (flared vs. flat), inclination angle, size of the
inner disk hole and stellar luminosity on the fitted chemical composition. Our
results show that the derived dust compositions by all methods deviate
systematically from the real chemical composition. Out of the four tested
spectral decomposition methods, our new two-layer temperature distribution
method, differs the least from the input dust composition and the results show
the weakest systematic effects. The reason for the deviations of the results
given by other methods lies in their simplifying assumptions (e.g. single
average grain temperature or one component continuum). We also tested the
influence of different noise levels on the results of the spectral
decomposition methods. We find that, for ground-based observations (8-13
micrometer) the expected uncertainty in the value of the crystallinity is about
11% for a signal-to-noise ratio of 100, while for space-based observations
(7-17 micrometer) the uncertainty is about 5%. On the basis of our results, we
propose a recipe for the analysis and interpretation of dust spectroscopy data
in the mid-infrared which should be especially valuable for analysing Spitzer

we obtain a mixed antiferromagnetic+superconducting phase at low doping with a
first-order transition to a pure superconducting phase accompanied by phase
separation. In the single-particle spectrum a clear Zhang-Rice singlet band
with an incoherent and a coherent part can be seen, in which holes enter upon
doping around $(\pi/2,\pi/2)$. The latter is very similar to the coherent
quasi-particle band crossing the Fermi surface in the single-band model. Doped
electrons go instead into the upper Hubbard band, first filling the regions of
the Brillouin zone around $(\pi,0)$. This fact can be related to the enhanced
robustness of the antiferromagnetic phase as a function of electron doping
compared to hole doping.

millimeter, sub-millimeter, and Spitzer data available for this cloud enable us
both to determine core properties precisely and to accurately classify cores as
starless or protostellar. The properties of cores in different cluster
environments and before-and-after star formation provide important constraints
on simulations of star-formation, particularly under the paradigm that the
essence of star formation is set by the turbulent formation of prestellar
cores. We separate the influence of stellar content from that of cluster
environment and find that cores within clusters have (1) higher kinetic
temperatures and (2) lower fractional abundances of CCS and NH3. Cores
associated with protostars have (1) slightly higher kinetic temperatures (2)
higher NH3 excitation temperatures), (3) are at higher column density, have (4)
slightly more non-thermal/turbulent NH3 linewidths, have (5) higher masses and
have (6) lower fractional abundance of CCS. We find that neither cluster
environment nor protostellar content makes a significant difference to the
dynamical state of cores as estimated by the virial parameter -- most cores in
each category are gravitationally bound. Overall, cluster environment and
protostellar content have a smaller influence on the properties of the cores
than is typically assumed, and the variation within categories is larger than
the differences between categories.

absorption line variations (CH, CH+, H2) in order to better characterize them.
We have mapped the CO(2-1) emission at 12 arcsec resolution around HD34078's
position, using the 30 m IRAM antenna. The follow-up of CH and CH+ absorption
lines has been extended over 5 more years. In parallel, CH absorption towards
the reddened star Zeta Per have been monitored to check the homogeneity of our
measurements. Three more FUSE spectra have been obtained to search for N(H2)
variations. CO observations show a pronounced maximum near HD34078's position,
clearly indicating that the star and diffuse cloud are associated. The optical
spectra confirm the reality of strong, rapid and correlated CH and CH+
fluctuations. On the other hand, N(H2, J=0) has varied by less than 5 % over 4
years. We also discard N(CH) variations towards Zeta Per at scales less than 20
AU. Observational constraints from this work and from 24 micron dust emission
appear to be consistent with H2 excitation but inconsistent with steady-state
bow shock models and rather suggest that the shell of compressed gas
surrounding HD34078, is seen at an early stage of the interaction. The CH and
CH+ time variations as well as their large abundances are likely due to
chemical structure in the shocked gas layer located at the stellar wind/ambient
cloud interface. Finally, the lack of variations for both N(H2, J=0) towards
HD34078 and N(CH) towards Zeta Per suggests that quiescent molecular gas is not
subject to pronounced small-scale structure.

momentum meaning that the superfluid density is homogeneous. We know for
decades that it is a priori possible to observe at high fields the
Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinikov (FFLO) state in which the superfluid density
exhibits a field dependent modulation. The search for such inhomogeneous
condensates in materials is the subject of tremendous excitement especially
after the discovery of a promising high-field superconducting (HFSC) phase in
CeCoIn$_5$. However, subsequent neutron and NMR experiments contradicted the
FFLO picture in CeCoIn$_5$ establishing a puzzling coupling of the distinct
HFSC state with a magnetic modulation. Here we show that, a novel type of
exotic state is observed at high fields in CeCoIn$_5$ in which a pattern of
coexisting condensates manifests. The specific pattern includes the d-wave
singlet SC state, the staggered $\pi$-triplet SC state and Spin Density Waves
(SDW). Because of particle-hole asymmetry these three condensates may either
appear separately or all three together providing a new perspective on
antiferromagnetic superconductors that may include high-$T_c$ cuprates and
pniktides. The field induced transition to the pattern state in CeCoIn$_5$ is
only a paradigm of a generic mechanism that prevents the elimination of the
dominating condensate by the field via the formation of a pattern of
condensates. This opens new avenues for the search of exotic states not only in
electronic systems, but also in other systems where inhomogeneous condensates
are actively discussed like trapped atomic fermi gases and dense quark matter.

previously known wide companions and all known spectroscopic binaries, we
determine the multiplicity rate of cool subdwarfs to be 26$\pm$6%, which is
somewhat lower than comparable main sequence stars, which have a multiplicity
rate of 37$\pm$5%. We find that only 3% of the cool subdwarfs surveyed have
companions within 10 AU, 3% have companions between 10 and 100 AU, and 14% have
companions beyond 100 AU. The other 6% of cool subdwarfs are spectroscopic
binaries. This is very different from K/M dwarfs that have most companions
(13%) at separations closer than 10 AU. However, because a search for close
binaries among a large sample of nearby cool subdwarfs remains elusive, it is
not yet settled whether or not the multiplicity rates are significantly
different. Nonetheless, several different observational results and theories
pointing to a possible dearth of subdwarf multiples are discussed.

deployments. However, even though traditional networking applications run
mostly unchanged over wireless links, the actual interaction between these
applications and the dynamics of wireless transmissions is not yet fully
understood. An important example of such applications are bandwidth estimation
tools. This area has become a mature research topic with well-developed
results. Unfortunately recent studies have shown that the application of these
results to WLAN links is not straightforward. The main reasons for this is that
the assumptions taken to develop bandwidth measurements tools do not hold any
longer in the presence of wireless links (e.g. non-FIFO scheduling). This paper
builds from these observations and its main goal is to analyze the interaction
between probe packets and WLAN transmissions in bandwidth estimation processes.
The paper proposes an analytical model that better accounts for the
particularities of WLAN links. The model is validated through extensive
experimentation and simulation and reveals that (1) the distribution of the
delay to transmit probing packets is not the same for the whole probing
sequence, this biases the measurements process and (2) existing tools and
techniques point at the achievable throughput rather than the available
bandwidth or the capacity, as previously assumed.

localized inhomogeneous enrichment from a single Type Ia supernova (SNeIa) and
intermediate-mass (4 7Msun) asymptotic giant branch (AGB) field stars. GC
formation is then assumed to take place within this chemically-peculiar region.
Thus, in our model the first low-mass GC stars to form are those with peculiar
abundances (i.e., O-depleted and Na-enhanced) while ``normal'' stars (i.e.,
O-rich and Na depleted) are formed in a second stage when self-pollution from
SNeII occurs and the peculiar pollution from the previous phase is dispersed.
In this study, we focus on three different GCs: NGC6752, NGC6205 (M13) and
NGC2808. We demonstrate that, within this framework, a model can be constructed
which is consistent with (i) the elemental abundance anti-correlations, (ii)
isotopic abundance patterns, and (iii) the extreme [O/Fe] values observed in
NGC2808 and M13, without violating the global constraints of approximately
unimodal [Fe/H] and C+N+O.

high-resolution observations of filament threads, i.e. the fine-structures of
solar filaments/prominences, and are typically damped in a few periods. Kink
wave modes supported by the thread body offer a consistent explanation of these
observed oscillations. Among the proposed mechanisms to explain the kink mode
damping, resonant absorption in the Alfven continuum seems to be the most
efficient as it produces damping times of about 3 periods. However, for a
nonzero-beta plasma and typical prominence conditions, the kink mode is also
resonantly coupled to slow (or cusp) continuum modes, which could further
reduce the damping time. In this Letter, we explore for the first time both
analytically and numerically the effect of the slow continuum on the damping of
transverse thread oscillations. The thread model is composed of a homogeneous
and straight cylindrical plasma, an inhomogeneous transitional layer, and the
homogeneous coronal plasma. We find that the damping of the kink mode due to
the slow resonance is much less efficient than that due to the Alfven
resonance.

very sensitive instruments. The full-sky maps of both temperature and

Multiscale methods, such as isotropic wavelets, steerable wavelets, or

estimated using the DYNAGE algorithm of Machalski et al., and compared with

expected, the DYNAGE fits give slightly different dynamical ages and other
model's parameters for the opposite lobes modelled independently each other,
e.g. the age ratios are found between ~1.1 to ~1.4. Demanding similar values of
the jet power and the radio core density for the same source, we look for a
self-consistent solution for the opposite lobes, which results in different
density profiles along them found by the fit. We also show that a departure
from the equipartition conditions assumed in the model, justified by X-ray
observations of the lobes of some nearby radio galaxies, and a relevant
variation of the magnetic-field strengths may provide an equalisation of the
lobes' ages. A comparison of the dynamical and spectral ages shows that a ratio
of the dynamical age to the spectral age of the lobes of investigated giant
radio galaxies is between ~1 and ~5, i.e. is similar to that found for smaller
radio galaxies (e.g. Parma et al. 1999). Supplementing possible causes for this
effect already discussed in the literature, like uncertainty of assumed
parameters of the model, an influence of a possible departure from the energy
equipartition assumption, etc. Arguments are given to suggest that DYNAGE can
better take account of radiative effects at lower frequencies than the
spectral-ageing analysis.The DYNAGE algorithm is especially effective for
sources at high redshifts, for which an intrinsic spectral curvature is shifted
to low frequencies.

shown to converge to $\zeta(2)$ as $n\to\infty$, as conjectured by M\'ezard and
Parisi (1987) through the so-called cavity method. The latter also suggested a
non-rigorous decentralized strategy for finding the optimum, which turned out
to be an instance of the Belief Propagation (BP) heuristic discussed by Pearl
(1987). In this paper we use the objective method to analyze the performance of
BP as the size of the underlying graph becomes large. Specifically, we
establish that the dynamic of BP on $\Knn$ converges in distribution as
$n\to\infty$ to an appropriately defined dynamic on the Poisson Weighted
Infinite Tree, and we then prove correlation decay for this limiting dynamic.
As a consequence, we obtain that BP finds an asymptotically correct assignment

convergence of BP derived by Bayati, Shah and Sharma (2005) and the best-known

particles annihilate largely to charged leptons, which enables them to produce
a spectrum of cosmic ray electrons and positrons consistent with the PAMELA and

factors (~10^3) are required. Despite these large boost factors and significant
annihilation to hadronic modes (35%), we find that the constraints from cosmic

this model force us to consider a rather specific range of masses

as the internal states of a system that lead to the same decision, based on a
user-provided utility or pay-off function. The utility function encodes some a
priori knowledge external to the system, it quantifies how bad it is to make
mistakes. The intrinsic underlying structure of the system is modeled by an
epsilon-machine and its causal states. The decisional states form a partition
of the lower-level causal states that is defined according to the higher-level
user's knowledge. In a complex systems perspective, the decisional states are
thus the ""emerging"" patterns corresponding to the utility function. The
transitions between these decisional states correspond to events that lead to a
change of decision. The new REMAPF algorithm estimates both the epsilon-machine
and the decisional states from data. Application examples are given for hidden
model reconstruction, cellular automata filtering, and edge detection in
images.

been explored in depth. In contrast, other basic properties like the existence
of bursts of rare words in specific documents, the topical organization of
collections, or the sublinear growth of vocabulary size with the length of a
document, have only been studied one by one and mainly applying heuristic
methodologies rather than basic principles and general mechanisms. As a
consequence, there is a lack of understanding of linguistic processes as
complex emergent phenomena. Beyond Zipf's law for word frequencies, here we
focus on Heaps' law, burstiness, and the topicality of document collections,
which encode correlations within and across documents absent in random null
models. We introduce and validate a generative model that explains the
simultaneous emergence of all these patterns from simple rules. As a result, we
find a connection between the bursty nature of rare words and the topical
organization of texts and identify dynamic word ranking and memory across

good agreement with available constraints for an accretion efficiency of ~10%.

establish a local reference for evolutionary studies of galaxies and galaxy

the WINGS sample and describes the procedures followed to construct them.
Methods. We have constructed photometric catalogs based on wide-field images in
B and V bands using SExtractor. Photometry has been performed on images in
which large galaxies and halos of bright stars were removed after modeling them
with elliptical isophotes. Results. We publish deep optical photometric
catalogs (90% complete at V~21.7, which translates to ~M*(V)+6 at mean

produced three catalogs containing galaxies, stars and objects of ""unknown""

resource) and assigning the resulting portions to several players in a way that
each of the players feels to have received a ``fair'' amount of the cake. An
important notion of fairness is envy-freeness: No player wishes to switch the
portion of the cake received with another player's portion. Despite intense
efforts in the past, it is still an open question whether there is a
\emph{finite bounded} envy-free cake-cutting protocol for an arbitrary number
of players, and even for four players. We introduce the notion of degree of
guaranteed envy-freeness (DGEF) as a measure of how good a cake-cutting
protocol can approximate the ideal of envy-freeness while keeping the protocol
finite bounded (trading being disregarded). We propose a new finite bounded
proportional protocol for any number n \geq 3 of players, and show that this

governed by Markovian dynamics. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are appropriate
especially in the case of conformational states that are hardly
distinguishable. However, the evolution of the conformational states of
proteins mostly shows non-Markovian behavior, recognizable by
non-monoexponential state dwell time histograms. The application of a Hidden
Markov Model technique to a cyclic system demonstrating semi-Markovian dynamics
is presented in this paper and the required extension of the model design is
discussed. As standard ranking criteria of models cannot deal with these
systems properly, a new approach is proposed considering the shape of the dwell
time histograms. We observed the rotational kinetics of a single F1-ATPase
alpha3beta3gamma sub-complex over six orders of magnitude of different ATP to
ADP and Pi concentration ratios, and established a general model describing the
kinetics for the entire range of concentrations. The HMM extension described
here is applicable in general to the accurate analysis of protein dynamics.

to survey the galaxy population to trace the geometry of the universe and the

goal of high precision cosmology they need to evaluate the capabilities of
different instrument designs based on realistic mock catalog. The aim of this
paper is to construct realistic and flexible mock catalogs based on our
knowledge of galaxy population from current deep surveys. We explore two
categories of mock catalog : (i) based on luminosity functions fit of
observations (GOODS, UDF,COSMOS,VVDS) using the Le Phare software (ii) based on
the observed COSMOS galaxy distribution which benefits from all the properties
of the data-rich COSMOS survey. For these two catalogs, we have produced
simulated number counts in several bands, color diagrams and redshift
distribution for validation against real observational data. We also derive
some basic requirements to help designing future Dark Energy mission in terms
of number of galaxies available for the weak-lensing analysis as a function of
the PSF size and depth of the survey. We also compute the spectroscopic success
rate for future spectroscopic redshift surveys (i) aiming at measuring BAO in
the case of the wide field spectroscopic redshift survey, and (ii) for the
photometric redshift calibration survey which is required to achieve weak

been pivotal in studying phase separation, but is hindered by being surface-
rather than bulk-sensitive. For our sputtered LCMO films the data indicates a
strong correlation between surface morphology and signatures of phase
separation; rough films show phase separation while atomically flat films are
electronically homogeneous but have a more or less inactive surface layer.
Regardless of surface morphology, the film bulk is electronically and
magnetically active. Many of the reported conclusions about electronic
inhomogeneities measured by STS have been confused by this issue. We study both

  December 1-3 2008",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The nature of most of the ~300 high-energy gamma-ray sources discovered by
the EGRET instrument aboard the Gamma-ray Observatory (GRO) between 1991 and
1999 is one of the greatest enigmas in high-energy astrophysics. While about
half of the extragalactic sources have been optically identified with Active
Galactic Nuclei (AGN), only a meagre 10% of the galactic sources have a
reliable identification. This low success rate has mainly to be ascribed to the
local crowding of potential optical counterparts and to the large gamma-ray
error boxes (of the order of one degree in radius) which prevented a
straightforward optical identification. Indeed, a multi-wavelength
identification strategy, based on a systematic coverage of the gamma-ray error
boxes, has been the only do-able approach. The situation is now greatly
improving thanks to the observations performed by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space
Telescope which, thanks to the LAT instrument, provides a factor of 50
improvement in sensitivity and a factor of 10 improvement in positional
accuracy. However, while the smaller error boxes will make the multi-wavelength
follow-ups easier, the larger sensitivity will enormously increase the number
of detected gamma-ray sources, requiring an even larger effort in the
multi-wavelength follow-ups. This effort can not be obviously sustained by
targeted observations only and it would greatly benefit from multi-wavelength
data and advanced data products available world wide through the science data
centres and interfaced by the Virtual Observatory (VO) tools. In this
contribution, I outline the science case, the multi-wavelength observation
synergies, and the requirements for both the the science data centres and the
VO.

unreliable T and beta estimates. Thus, for long wavelength observations (lambda
>~ 200 micron), or for warm sources (T >~ 60 K), it becomes difficult to
distinguish sources with different temperatures. We assess the role of noise in
recent observational results that indicate an inverse and continuously varying
T - beta relation. Though an inverse and continuous T - beta correlation may be
a physical property of dust in the ISM, we find that the observed inverse
correlation may be primarily due to noise.

absorption covering a wide range of column densities, ionization and dynamics,
and discuss the growing evidence for partial-covering absorption from data at
energies > 10 keV. Such absorption can also explain the observed X-ray spectral
curvature and variability in AGN at lower energies and is likely an important
factor in shaping the observed properties of this class of source.
Consideration of self-consistent models for local AGN indicates that X-ray
spectra likely comprise a combination of absorption and reflection effects from
material originating within a few light days of the black hole as well as on
larger scales. It is likely that AGN X-ray spectra may be strongly affected by
the presence of disk-wind outflows that are expected in systems with high
accretion rates, and we describe models that attempt to predict the effects of
radiative transfer through such winds, and discuss the prospects for new data

after the neutrino trapping time scale (~10 s). Consequently the compact
remnant of SN 1987A may be a strange quark star, which has a softer equation of
state than that of neutron star matter. Such a phase transition can induce the
stellar collapse and result in a large amplitude stellar oscillations. We use a
three dimensional Newtonian hydrodynamic code to study the time evolution of
the temperature and density at the neutrinosphere. Extremely intense pulsating
neutrino fluxes, with submillisecond period and with neutrino energy (> 30 MeV)
can be emitted because the oscillations of the temperature and density are out
of phase almost 180 degree. If this is true we predict that the current X-ray
emission from the compact remnant of SN 1987A will be lower than 10^34 erg s-1,
and it should be a thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum for a bare strange star with
surface temperature of around ~10^7 K.

decomposition allows for calculating $\psi$ for moderate and large $t$, to any
prescribed exponential accuracy, using optimal truncation of power series plus
finitely many Gamow vectors contributions. The analytic structure of $\psi$ is
perhaps surprising: in general (even in simple examples such as square wells),

trees. In this article is suggested a new method which solves this problem. The
idea is to design a double film blanket filled by light gas (for example,
methane, hydrogen, or helium). Sections of this AB Blanket are lighter then air
and fly in atmosphere. They can be made on a flat area (serving as an assembly
area) and delivered by dirigible or helicopter to station at altitude over the
city. Here they connect to the already assembled AB Blanket subassemblies,
cover the city in an AB Dome and protect it from bad weather, chemical,

  2008",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While linear programming (LP) decoding provides more flexibility for
finite-length performance analysis than iterative message-passing (IMP)
decoding, it is computationally more complex to implement in its original form,
due to both the large size of the relaxed LP problem, and the inefficiency of
using general-purpose LP solvers. This paper explores ideas for fast LP
decoding of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. We first prove, by modifying
the previously reported Adaptive LP decoding scheme to allow removal of
unnecessary constraints, that LP decoding can be performed by solving a number
of LP problems that contain at most one linear constraint derived from each of
the parity-check constraints. By exploiting this property, we study a sparse
interior-point implementation for solving this sequence of linear programs.
Since the most complex part of each iteration of the interior-point algorithm
is the solution of a (usually ill-conditioned) system of linear equations for
finding the step direction, we propose a preconditioning algorithm to
facilitate iterative solution of such systems. The proposed preconditioning
algorithm is similar to the encoding procedure of LDPC codes, and we
demonstrate its effectiveness via both analytical methods and computer
simulation results.

deformation on nuclear transition matrix elements is investigated by varying
the strength of quadrupolar correlations in the parent and daughter nuclei
independently. The variation of the nuclear transition matrix elements as a
function of the difference in deformation parameters of parent and daughter
nuclei reveals that in general, the former tend to be maximum for equal
deformation and they decrease as the difference in deformation parameters
increases, exhibiting a very similar trend for the $(\beta^{-}\beta

estimators and their covariances. We investigate the optimality of these
approximation, how accurate the covariance needs to be, and how to estimate the
covariance from simulations. For a simple case with azimuthal symmetry we
compare optimality of hybrid pseudo-C_l CMB power spectrum estimators with the
exact result, indicating that the loss of information is not negligible, but
neither is it enough to have a large effect on standard parameter constraints.
We then discuss the number of samples required to estimate the covariance from
simulations, with and without a good analytic approximation, and assess the use
of shrinkage estimators. Finally we discuss how to combine an approximate
high-ell likelihood with a more exact low-ell harmonic-space likelihood as a
practical method for accurate likelihood calculation on all scales.

alternating stripe pattern. We observe a broad band of magnetic excitations
above a small gap of 1.8 meV and extending up to 7.5 meV, indicating strongly
dispersive excitations. The measured dispersions of the boundaries of the
powder-averaged spectrum can be quantitatively explained by a linear spin-wave
dispersion for triangular layers with antiferromagnetic nearest- and weak
next-nearest neighbor couplings, a strong easy-axis anisotropy and additional
weak inter-layer couplings. The resulting dispersion relation has global minima
not at magnetic Bragg wavevectors but at symmetry-related soft points and we
attribute this anomalous feature to the strong competition between the
easy-axis anisotropy and the frustrated antiferromagnetic couplings. We have
also calculated the quantum corrections to the dispersion relation to order 1/S
in spin-wave theory by extending the work of Chubukov and Jolicoeur [Phys. Rev.

smooth and non--flat in $r$ in a neighborhood of $\gamma_0$. We define the

its ideal structure. This algebra is the Banach algebra most naturally
associated with the dynamical system, and it has a richer structure than its
well studied $C^*$-envelope, as becomes evident from the possible existence of
non-self-adjoint closed ideals. This paper initiates the study of these

determined when exactly the algebra is simple, or prime, and when there exists
a non-self-adjoint closed ideal. In addition, a structure theorem is obtained
for the case when $X$ consists of one finite orbit, and the algebra is shown to
be Hermitian if $X$ is finite. The key to these results lies in analysing the
commutant of $C(X)$ in the algebra, which can be shown to be a maximal abelian
subalgebra with non-zero intersection with each non-zero closed ideal.

facilitate numerical examination of not only how QC algorithms work, but also
to include noise, decoherence, and attenuation effects and to evaluate the
efficacy of error correction schemes. The present work builds on an earlier
Mathematica code QDENSITY, which is mainly a pedagogic tool. In QCMPI, the
stress is on state vectors, in order to employ a large number of qubits. The
parallel processing feature is implemented by using the Message-Passing
Interface (MPI) protocol.
  Codes for Grover's search and Shor's factoring algorithms are provided as
examples. A major feature of this work is that concurrent versions of the
algorithms can be evaluated with each version subject to alternate noise
effects, which corresponds to the idea of solving a stochastic Schr\""{o}dinger
equation.

two codimension-one parallel plates, located on a $(D+1)$-dimensional
background spacetime with an arbitrary internal space. The most general case of
different Robin coefficients on the two separate plates is considered. With
independence of the geometry of the internal space, the Casimir forces are seen
to be attractive for special cases of Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions
on both plates and repulsive for Dirichlet boundary conditions on one plate and
Neumann boundary conditions on the other. For Robin boundary conditions, the
Casimir forces can be either attractive or repulsive, depending on the Robin
coefficients and the separation between the plates, what is actually remarkable
and useful. Indeed, we demonstrate the existence of an equilibrium point for
the interplate distance, which is stabilized due to the Casimir force, and show
that stability is enhanced by the presence of the extra dimensions.
Applications of these properties in braneworld models are discussed. Finally,
the corresponding results are generalized to the geometry of a piston of

formalism - total energy for any configuration - is also obtained from the
formalism (ES-DWF) that incorporates the role of Debye-Waller Factor in
electronic structure calculations. The two formalisms are exactly equivalent
and represent the direct and perturbation theory approaches to determine total
energy. This equivalence allows either formalism to be used depending on the
requirement - ES-DWF for a priori theoretical analysis and AIMD for ab initio
modeling of the effect of thermal vibrations. Combining the two formalisms
makes the ES-DWF formalism into an ab initio method and increases the range of
problems that can be modeled ab initio. It is also theoretically possible to
obtain self-consistent band structures from AIMD calculations. This study
clarifies the incorrect assumptions regarding the two formalisms that exist in

effects, more accurate results can be obtained, ab initio, within the adiabatic
approximation, than by using AIMD alone.

external magnetic field of magnetars may contain a toroidal component, likely

threaded by currents flowing along the closed field lines which can efficiently
interact with soft thermal photons via resonant cyclotron scatterings (RCS).
Actually, RCS spectral models proved quite successful in explaining the
persistent ~1-10 keV emission from the magnetar candidates, the soft gamma-ray
repeaters (SGRs) and the anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs). Moreover, it has been
proposed that, in presence of highly relativistic electrons, the same process
can give rise to the observed hard X-ray spectral tails extending up to ~200
keV. Spectral calculations have been restricted up to now to the case of a
globally twisted dipolar magnetosphere, although there are indications that the
twist may be confined only to a portion of the magnetosphere, and/or that the
large scale field is more complex than a simple dipole. In this paper we
investigate multipolar, force-free magnetospheres of ultra-magnetized neutron
stars. We first discuss a general method to generate multipolar solutions of
the Grad- Schluter-Shafranov equation, and analyze in detail dipolar,
quadrupolar and octupolar fields. The spectra and lightcurves for these
multipolar, globally twisted fields are then computed using a Monte Carlo code
and compared with those of a purely dipolar configuration. Finally the

Boltzmann evolution and prove its convergence to the associated Boltzmann
equation when $N\to \infty$. For any time $T>0$ we bound the distance between
the empirical measure of the particle system and the measure given by the
Boltzmann evolution in some homogeneous negative Sobolev space. The control we
get is Gaussian, i.e. we prove that the distance is bigger than $x N^{-1/2}$
with a probability of type $O(e^{-x^2})$. The two main ingredients are first a
control of fluctuations due to the discrete nature of collisions, secondly a
Lipschitz continuity for the Boltzmann collision kernel. The latter condition,
in our present setting, is only satisfied for Maxwellian models. Numerical
computations tend to show that our results are useful in practice.

curved regions of space-time. Exact expressions for luminosity distances and

magnitudes of astrophysical sources. It is found that the intervening voids we
consider, between the observer and source, produce changes in apparent
magnitude of less than 0.012. Sources inside voids, however, can be affected
considerably at redshifts below z~0.5. By averaging observable quantities over
many randomly generated distributions of voids we find that the presence of
these structures has the effect of introducing a dispersion around the mean,
which itself can be displaced the background value. Observers in an
inhomogeneous universe, who take averages of observables along many different
lines of sight, may then introduce systematic biases, and under-estimate
errors, if these effects are not taken into account. Estimates of the potential
size of these effects are made using data from simulated large-scale structure.

subtle optical anisotropy of space around a spherically symmetric, non-rotating

show that the refractive index in such a pseudo-isotropic system would be a

investigate the spectral energy distribution (SED) resulting from a one-zone

  We present here results of such a model, where we have considered synchrotron
radiation by primary electrons and protons, inverse Compton interactions, and
gamma-ray emission originated by the inelastic hadronic interactions between
relativistic protons and cold nuclei within the jets themselves. Photo-meson
production by relativistic hadrons were also taken into account, as well as the
effects of secondary particles injected by all interactions. The internal and

the observable SED, which was also recently constrained by the results of HESS.
