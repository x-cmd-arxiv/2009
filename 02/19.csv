radial velocity data by reanalysing a set of radial velocity measurements. We
present Bayesian analysis of a recently published set of radial velocity
measurements known to contain the signal of one extrasolar planetary candidate,
namely, HD 11506. The analysis is conducted using the Markov chain Monte Carlo
method and the resulting distributions of orbital parameters are tested by
performing direct integration of randomly selected samples with the
Bulirsch-Stoer method. The magnitude of the stellar radial velocity
variability, known as jitter, is treated as a free parameter with no
assumptions about its magnitude. We show that the orbital parameters of the
planet known to be present in the data correspond to a different solution when
the jitter is allowed to be a free parameter. We also show evidence of an
additional candidate, a 0.8 MJup planet with period of about 0.5 yr in orbit
around HD 11506. This second planet is inferred to be present with a high level
of confidence.

not be described in the framework of mean field Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) theory
because multivalent counterions form a strongly correlated liquid (SCL) on the
surface of the macroion. It was predicted that a distant counterion polarizes
the SCL as if it were a metallic surface and creates an electrostatic image.
The attractive potential energy of the image is the reason why the charge
density of counterions decreases faster with distance from the charged surface
than in PB theory. Using the Monte Carlo method to find the equilibrium
distribution of counterions around the macroion, we confirm the existence of
the image potential energy. It is also shown that due to the negative screening
length of the SCL, $-2\xi$, the effective metallic surface is actually above
the SCL by $|\xi|$.

calculate the graviton field produced in the collisions in the NLO and NNLO

one shock wave is much higher than in the other one. In the boundary theory
this setup corresponds to proton-nucleus collisions, with the nucleus being the
denser of the two shock waves and the proton being the less dense one.
Employing the eikonal approximation we find the exact high energy analytic
solution for the metric in AdS_5 for the asymmetric collision of two
delta-function shock waves. The solution resums all-order graviton exchanges
with the ""nucleus"" shock wave and a single-graviton exchange with the ""proton""
shock wave. Using the holographic renormalization prescription we read off the
energy-momentum tensor of the matter produced in proton-nucleus collisions. We
show in explicit detail that in the boundary theory the proton is completely
stopped by strong-coupling interactions with the nucleus, in agreement with our
earlier results. We also apply the eikonal technique to the asymmetric
collision of two unphysical delta-prime shock waves, which we introduced in an
earlier work as a means of modeling nuclear collisions with weak coupling
initial dynamics. We obtain a surprising result that, for delta-prime shock
waves, the multiple bulk graviton exchange series giving the leading
energy-dependent contribution to the energy-momentum tensor terminates at the

relay station simultaneously assists two transmitters in multicasting their
independent messages to two receivers. The relay may also have an independent
message of its own to multicast. As a first step to address this general model,
referred to as the compound multiple access channel with a relay (cMACr), the
capacity region of the multiple access channel with a ""cognitive"" relay is
characterized, including the cases of partial and rate-limited cognition. Then,
achievable rate regions for the cMACr model are presented based on
decode-and-forward (DF) and compress-and-forward (CF) relaying strategies.
Moreover, an outer bound is derived for the special case, called the cMACr
without cross-reception, in which each transmitter has a direct link to one of
the receivers while the connection to the other receiver is enabled only
through the relay terminal. The capacity region is characterized for a binary
modulo additive cMACr without cross-reception, showing the optimality of binary
linear block codes, thus highlighting the benefits of physical layer network
coding and structured codes. Results are extended to the Gaussian channel model
as well, providing achievable rate regions for DF and CF, as well as for a
structured code design based on lattice codes. It is shown that the performance
with lattice codes approaches the upper bound for increasing power, surpassing
the rates achieved by the considered random coding-based techniques.

ill-defined. Strong gravitational lensing furnishes a powerful method to probe
gravity in the central regions of galaxies. It can (1) provide a unique
detection-channel of dark-matter substructure beyond the local galaxy group,
(2) constrain dark-matter physics, complementary to direct-detection
experiments, as well as metric theories of gravity, (3) probe central
super-massive black holes, and (4) provide crucial insight into galaxy
formation processes from the dark matter point of view, independently of the
nature and state of dark matter. To seriously address the above questions, a
considerable increase in the number of strong gravitational-lens systems is

30-50m telescopes for spectroscopy (e.g. TMT, GMT, ELT). To answer these
fundamental questions through strong gravitational lensing, a strong investment
in large radio and optical-IR facilities is therefore critical in the coming
decade. In particular, only large-scale radio lens surveys (e.g. with SKA)
provide the large numbers of high-resolution and high-fidelity images of lenses
needed for SMBH and flux-ratio anomaly studies.

molecular-weight organic semiconductors are commonly carried out using a
technique in which a phosphorescent-doped probe layer is set in the vicinity of
a supposed exciton generation zone. However, analyses commonly used to retrieve
$L$ ignore microcavity effects that may induce a strong modulation of the
emitted light as the position of the exciton probe is shifted. The present
paper investigates in detail how this technique may be improved to obtain more
accurate results for L. The example of 4,4'-bis(carbazol-9-yl)1,1'-biphenyl
(CBP) is taken, for which a triplet diffusion length of L=16 +/- 4 nm (at 3
mA/cm2) is inferred from experiments. The influence of triplet-triplet
annihilation, responsible for an apparent decrease of L at high current
densities, is theoretically investigated, as well as the 'invasiveness' of the
thin probe layer on the exciton distribution. The interplay of microcavity
effects and direct recombinations is demonstrated experimentally with the
archetypal trilayer structure
[N,N'-bis(naphthalen-1-yl)-N,N'-bis(phenyl)]-4,4'-diaminobiphenyl (NPB)/CBP/
2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (named bathocuproine, BCP). It is
shown that in this device holes do cross the NPB/CBP junction, without the
assistance of electrons and despite the high energetic barrier imposed by the
shift between the HOMO levels. The use of the variable-thickness doped layer
technique in this case is then discussed. Finally, some guidelines are given
for improving the measure of the diffusion length of triplet excitons in
operational OLEDs, applicable to virtually any small molecular-weight material.

spirals for which the stellar kinematics have been measured. For 10 out of the
18 galaxies, HST data in both F160W (H) and F606W (V) are available, and, for
those, we present colour maps and radial colour profiles at the resolution of
the Hubble Space Telescope.
  Colours vary significantly from galaxy to galaxy, but tend to be highly
homogeneous within each galaxy, with smooth and flat colour profiles. Some of
the colour maps show jumps in the inner regions, likely due to dust. We
determine extinction-maps in an almost model-independent way using the V-H
colour map and the SAURON Mg b absorption line map of Ganda et al. (2007). The
maps show that A_V ranges from 0 to 2 mag, in the center from 0 to 1.5 mag, in
agreement with the models of Tuffs et al. (2004).
  We describe the surface brightness profiles as the superposition of an
exponential disk and a Sersic bulge. The bulges are small (0.1-2.5 kpc), and
show a shape parameter n ranging from ~ 0.7 to 3, with a mean value smaller
than two: well below the value for the 'classical' de Vaucouleurs bulges. Most
galaxies (16 out of 18) show a central light excess above the Sersic fit to the
bulge, which can be interpreted as a nuclear cluster, as shown by previous
studies. We provide zero-order estimates for the magnitude of these components.
We discuss the correlations among the structural galaxy parameters and with
other relevant quantities (abridged).

discoveries (extra-solar planets, dark matter, dark energy) and precision
cosmology. Fundamental understanding of the working of stars and galaxies is
within reach, thanks to newly available precision measurements. We highlight
the importance of distances and model independent distances and masses.
  Distances are fundamental in astrophysics and their knowledge can change our
perception of phenomena dramatically: e.g., in antiquity, the Heliocentric
model was rejected because the predicted stellar parallaxes were not observed.
  Distance measurements are directly related to the history & fate of the uni-
verse as they provide 2 of 3 methods available to date the universe. The 1st
method is based on the ages of stars, which can be ascertained if their lumi-
nosities (distances) are accurately known. The 2nd method relies on cosmolo-
gical methods. To 1st order, the age of the universe is the inverse H_0.
  As stressed by the previous decadal report, ""the fundamental goal of ...
astrophysics is to understand how the universe ... galaxies [and] stars ...
formed, how they evolved, and what their destiny will be."" These questions can
be answered partly by micro-arcsecond astrometry: 1) Galactic archeology: a
detailed reconstruction of the formation history of the Milky Way and other
Local Group galaxies, 2) the very oldest stars in the Milky Way and the age of
the Universe, and 3) H_0 and concordance cosmology.
  These goals are achievable by combining muas-arcsecond astrometry from the
proposed SIM-Lite mission supplemented with ground-based spectroscopy. The
results of our proposed project will force the biggest reassessment of stellar
astrophysics in 50 years, which will affect most branches of astrophysics.

This requires the fast generation of random numbers greater or smaller than a
certain value. We present a method to achieve this, and also to generate random
numbers within any arbitrary interval. We demonstrate the method showing the
properties of the transform maps of the above mentioned distributions as
examples of stable and geometric stable random numbers used for the stochastic

with shorter range hotspots (e.g. femtocells, distributed antennas, or wired
relays) -- with universal frequency reuse, the near-far effect from cross-tier
interference creates dead spots where reliable coverage cannot be guaranteed to
users in either tier. Equipping the macrocell and femtocells with multiple
antennas enhances robustness against the near-far problem. This work derives
the maximum number of simultaneously transmitting multiple antenna femtocells
meeting a per-tier outage probability constraint. Coverage dead zones are
presented wherein cross-tier interference bottlenecks cellular and hotspot
coverage. Two operating regimes are shown namely 1) a cellular-limited regime
in which femtocell users experience unacceptable cross-tier interference and 2)
a hotspot-limited regime wherein both femtocell users and cellular users are
limited by hotspot interference. Our analysis accounts for the per-tier
transmit powers, the number of transmit antennas (single antenna transmission
being a special case) and terrestrial propagation such as the Rayleigh fading
and the path loss exponents. Single-user (SU) multiple antenna transmission at
each tier is shown to provide significantly superior coverage and spatial reuse
relative to multiuser (MU) transmission. We propose a decentralized
carrier-sensing approach to regulate femtocell transmission powers based on
their location. Considering a worst-case cell-edge location, simulations using
typical path loss scenarios show that our interference management strategy
provides reliable cellular coverage with about 60 femtocells per cellsite.

Ising SG (FISG) model in the presence of a magnetic transverse field $\Gamma$.
The fermionic path integral formalism, replica method and static approach have
been used to obtain the thermodynamic potential within one step replica
symmetry breaking ansatz. The replica symmetry (RS) results show that the SG
phase is always unstable against the replicon. Moreover, the two other
eigenvalues $\lambda_{\pm}$ of the Hessian matrix (related to the diagonal
elements of the replica matrix) can indicate an additional instability to the
SG phase, which enhances when $\Gamma$ is increased. Therefore, this result
suggests that the study of the replicon can not be enough to guarantee the RS
stability in the present quantum FISG model, especially near the quantum
critical point. In particular, the FISG model allows changing the occupation
number of sites, so one can get a first order transition when the chemical
potential exceeds a certain value. In this region, the replicon and the
$\lambda_{\pm}$ indicate instability problems for the SG solution close to all
range of first order boundary.

isolating the quantum system from the environment to prevent decoherence, and
easily and accurately controlling the system with external fields. For example,
neutral-atom optical-lattice architectures provide environmental isolation
through the use of states that are robust against fluctuating external fields,
yet external fields are essential for qubit addressing. Here we demonstrate the
selection of individual qubits with external fields, despite the fact that the

inhomogeneous external field to map selected qubits to a different
field-insensitive superposition (""optical MRI""), minimally perturbing
unselected qubits, despite the fact that the addressing field is not spatially
localized. We show robust single-qubit rotations on neutral-atom qubits located

dark matter, both within and beyond extensions of the Standard Model of
particle physics. Each of these candidates may have scattering (and other)
cross section properties that are consistent with the dark matter abundance,
BBN, and the most scales in the matter power spectrum; but which may have
vastly different behavior at sub-galactic ""cutoff"" scales, below which dark
matter density fluctuations are smoothed out. The only way to quantitatively
measure the power spectrum behavior at sub-galactic scales at distances beyond
the local universe, and indeed over cosmic time, is through probes available in
multiply imaged strong gravitational lenses. Gravitational potential
perturbations by dark matter substructure encode information in the observed
relative magnifications, positions, and time delays in a strong lens. Each of
these is sensitive to a different moment of the substructure mass function and
to different effective mass ranges of the substructure. The time delay
perturbations, in particular, are proving to be largely immune to the
degeneracies and systematic uncertainties that have impacted exploitation of
strong lenses for such studies. There is great potential for a coordinated
theoretical and observational effort to enable a sophisticated exploitation of
strong gravitational lenses as direct probes of dark matter properties. This
opportunity motivates this white paper, and drives the need for: a) strong
support of the theoretical work necessary to understand all astrophysical
consequences for different dark matter candidates; and b) tailored
observational campaigns, and even a fully dedicated mission, to obtain the
requisite data.

particular, non-Abelian gauge potentials for ultracold atoms trapped in optical
lattices. Motivated by this fact, we investigate the fundamental properties of
an ultracold Fermi gas in a non-Abelian U(2) gauge potential characterized by a
constant Wilson loop. Under this specific condition, the energy spectrum
exhibits a robust band structure with large gaps and reveals a new fractal
figure. The transverse conductivity is related to topological invariants and is
shown to be quantized when the Fermi energy lies inside a gap of the spectrum.
We demonstrate that the analogue of the integer quantum Hall effect for neutral
atoms survives the non-Abelian coupling and leads to a striking fractal phase
diagram. Moreover, this coupling induces an anomalous Hall effect as observed
in graphene.

measurements due to the sample selection of LRGs and due to uncertainties in

determined using a it flux-limited LRG sample and a volume-limited one. The
comparison shows that the relative halo bias of MgII absorbers using a
flux-limited LRG sample can be overestimated by as much as \approx 20%. Next,
we assess the systematic uncertainty due to photometric redshift errors using a
mock galaxy catalog with added redshift uncertainties comparable to the data.
We show that the relative clustering amplitude measured without accounting for
photometric redshift uncertainties is overestimated by \approx 10%. After
accounting for these two main uncertainties, we find a 1-\sigma
anti-correlation between mean halo bias and absorber strength that translates
into a 1-\sigma anti-correlation between mean galaxy mass and W_r(2796). The
results indicate that a significant fraction of the MgII absorber population of
W_r(2796)=1-1.5 \AA are found in group-size dark matter halos of log M_h <

Compared to the pure PBE functional, the lattice constants expanded with
respect to the experimental value when the PBE-HF hybrid functionals were

growth of fine particles, the internal structure of which corresponds to
different crystal lattices. A growing cluster (particle) is immersed in, and
exchanges monomer building blocks with a surrounding medium of diffusing

allowing, in addition to detachment, monomer motion to the neighboring vacant
crystal sites, according to probabilistic rules mimicking local thermalization.
The key new feature of our model is the focus on the growth of a single

can control large-scale growth modes. This single, defect-free core growth is
imposed by the specific dynamical rules assumed. Our results offer a possible
explanation of the experimentally observed shape uniformity, i.e., fixed,
approximately even-sized proportions, in synthesis of uniform colloids and
nanoparticles. We demonstrate the basic principles of well-defined particle
shape emergence in such growth. Specifically, several shapes are possible for a
given crystal structure. Formation of shapes that follow the crystal symmetry
and are uniform, can be a result of the nonequilibrium nature of the growth
process. The shape of a growing particle can be controlled by varying the
relative rates of kinetic processes, as well as by adjusting the concentration

large Balmer decrement. The MIR emission measured with the Spitzer IRS in the
narrow 10-20mu band is extraordinarily luminous (3.5 x 10^{43} erg\s). The IRS
spectrum shows a bump around ~11mu and an increase towards longer wavelengths,
reminiscent of silicate emission. The strong MIR excess over the NIR implies
the dominance of relatively cold dust. The X-ray luminosity of 10^{41} erg\s

day stellar mass in 8 Gyr. In almost all galaxies in our sample the specific
SFR (SFR per unit stellar mass) of the bulge is higher than that of the outer
disk, suggesting that almost all galaxies are increasing their B/T through
internal star formation. In pseudobulges, SFR density correlates, positvely,
with mass density, this is consistent with that stellar mass being formed by
moderate, extended star fromation. As well, SFR density and stellar mass of
pseudobulges are shown to be correlated with the stellar mass of the outer
disk. Classical bulges have the lowest specific SFR implying a growth times
that are longer than a Hubble time. We identify a class of bulges that have
nuclear morphology similar to pseudobulges, significantly lower specific SFR
than pseudobulges, and are closer to classical bulges in structural parameter
correlations. Our results are consistent with a scenario in which bulge growth
via internal star formation is a natural, and near ubiquitous phenomenon in
disk galaxies. Some disk galaxies with out a large classical bulge, over long
periods of extended star formation are able to growth a pseudobulge. In this
sense, galaxies with pseudobulges may very well be bulgeless (or
""quasi-bulgeless"") galaxies, and galaxies with classical bulges are galaxies in
which both internal evolution and hierarchical merging are responsible for the
bulge mass by fractions that vary from galaxy-to-galaxy. [Abridged]

made possible in the next decade, with the launch of the James Webb Space
Telescope (JWST). We carry out cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations
of Population III (Pop III) starbursts in a 10^8 M_Sun dwarf galaxy at z =
12.5. For different star formation efficiencies and stellar initial mass
functions (IMFs), we calculate the luminosities and equivalent widths (EWs) of
the recombination lines H_alpha, Ly_alpha, and He II 1640, under the simple
assumption that the stellar population does not evolve over the first ~3 Myr of
the starburst. Although only < 40 percent of the gas in the central 100 pc of
the galaxy is photoionized, we find that photoheating by massive stars causes a
strong dynamical response, which results in a weak correlation between
luminosity emitted in hydrogen recombination lines and the total mass in stars.
However, owing to the low escape fraction of He II-ionizing photons, the
luminosity emitted in He II 1640 is much more strongly correlated with the
total stellar mass. The ratio of the luminosity in He II 1640 to that in
Ly_alpha or H_alpha is found to be a good indicator of the IMF in many cases.
The ratio of observable fluxes is F_1640/F_Halpha ~ 1 for clusters of 100 M_Sun
Pop III stars and F_1640/F_Halpha ~ 0.1 for clusters of 25 M_Sun Pop III stars.
The EW of the He II 1640 emission line is the most reliable IMF indicator, its
value varying between ~ 20 and ~ 200 angstrom for a massive and very massive
Pop III IMF, respectively. Even the bright, initial stages of Pop III
starbursts in the first dwarf galaxies will likely not be directly detectable
by the JWST. Instead, the JWST may discover only more massive, and hence more
chemically evolved, galaxies which host normal, Pop I/II, star formation.

degree of a shallow minor of a graph in the class is bounded by a function of
the depth of the shallow minor. Several linear-time algorithms are known for
bounded expansion classes (such as subgraph isomorphism testing), and they
allow restricted homomorphism dualities, amongst other desirable properties. In
this paper we establish two new characterisations of bounded expansion classes,
one in terms of so-called topological parameters, the other in terms of
controlling dense parts. The latter characterisation is then used to show that
the notion of bounded expansion is compatible with Erd\""os-R\'enyi model of
random graphs with constant average degree. In particular, we prove that for
every fixed $d>0$, there exists a class with bounded expansion, such that a
random graph of order $n$ and edge probability $d/n$ asymptotically almost
surely belongs to the class. We then present several new examples of classes
with bounded expansion that do not exclude some topological minor, and appear
naturally in the context of graph drawing or graph colouring. In particular, we
prove that the following classes have bounded expansion: graphs that can be
drawn in the plane with a bounded number of crossings per edge, graphs with
bounded stack number, graphs with bounded queue number, and graphs with bounded
non-repetitive chromatic number. We also prove that graphs with `linear'
crossing number are contained in a topologically-closed class, while graphs
with bounded crossing number are contained in a minor-closed class.

moduli space of type II string theories has led to much progress recently in
uncovering D-instanton contributions. In this work, we suggest that the
extended duality group SL(3,Z), which includes both S-duality and Ehlers
symmetry, may determine the contributions of D5 and NS5-branes. We support this
claim by automorphizing the perturbative corrections to the ""extended universal
hypermultiplet"", a five-dimensional universal SL(3,R)/SO(3) subspace which
includes the string coupling, overall volume, Ramond zero-form and six-form and
NS axion. Using the non-Abelian Fourier expansion of the Eisenstein series
attached to the principal series of SL(3,R), first worked out by Vinogradov and
Takhtajan 30 years ago, we extract the contributions of D(-1)-D5 and NS5-brane
instantons, corresponding to the Abelian and non-Abelian coefficients,
respectively. In particular, the contributions of k NS5-branes can be
summarized into a vector of wave functions \Psi_{k,l}, l=0... k-1, as expected
on general grounds. We also point out that for more general models with a
symmetric moduli space G/K, the minimal theta series of G generates an infinite
series of exponential corrections of the form required for ""small""
D(-1)-D1-D3-D5-NS5 instanton bound states. As a mathematical spin-off, we make
contact with earlier results in the literature about the spherical vectors for
the principal series of SL(3,R) and for minimal representations.

the Galaxy. It features a bright H II region erupting as a blister from the
side of a giant molecular cloud (GMC). Combining photometry from the Spitzer
GLIMPSE survey with complementary infrared (IR) surveys, we identify candidate
young stellar objects (YSOs) throughout a 1.5 deg x 1 deg field that includes
the M17 complex. The long sightline through the Galaxy behind M17 creates
significant contamination in our YSO sample from unassociated sources with
similar IR colors. Removing contaminants, we produce a highly-reliable catalog
of 96 candidate YSOs with a high probability of association with the M17
complex. We fit model spectral energy distributions to these sources and
constrain their physical properties. Extrapolating the mass function of 62
intermediate-mass YSOs (M >3 Msun), we estimate that >1000 stars are in the
process of forming in the extended outer regions of M17.
  From IR survey images from IRAS and GLIMPSE, we find that M17 lies on the rim
of a large shell structure ~0.5 deg in diameter (~20 pc at 2.1 kpc). We present
new maps of CO and 13CO (J=2-1) emission, which show that the shell is a
coherent, kinematic structure associated with M17 at v = 19 km/s. The shell is
an extended bubble outlining the photodissociation region of a faint, diffuse H
II region several Myr old. We provide evidence that massive star formation has
been triggered by the expansion of the bubble. The formation of the massive
cluster ionizing the M17 H II region itself may have been similarly triggered.
We conclude that the star formation history in the extended environment of M17

from their source undeflected by magnetic fields and unimpeded by interactions

detected in dense, radio frequency (RF) transparent media via the Askaryan

the subsequent investigation of a global analytic approach to the construction

other fields, in particular, superstring theory and superconformal field
theory.
  This new approach, which was actually first proposed by Molotkov and Schwarz
and Voronov already in the mid-80s, is based on a consequent use of the functor
of points. Apart from clarifying various issues of supergeometry which
sometimes remain obscure in the standard (ringed-space) approach, its main
achievement is that it makes infinite-dimensional supermanifolds available.
  We use this to define the supermanifold of all almost complex structures on a
given finite-dimensional supermanifold and show that it actually carries a
complex structure itself. Moreover we succeed in giving an explicit definition
and construction of the diffeomorphism supergroup of a finite-dimensional
supermanifold.
  We then combine these results to show that one can construct a slice for the
action of the diffeomorphism supergroup on the subspace of integrable almost
complex structures on a smooth closed oriented 2|2-dimensional supersurface.
This slice represents a local patch of super Teichmueller space. We also
investigate how this construction changes if one instead looks at N=1
superconformal structures on such a surface and show that one obtains an

Lipschitz continuous initial data. Assuming only a certain bound on the

the parabolic equation \eqref{PMA} for the Lagrangian potential has a longtime
solution which is smooth for all positive time and satisfies uniform estimates
away from time $t=0$. In particular, under the mean curvature flow the graph
immediately becomes smooth and the solution exists for all time such that the
second fundamental form decays uniformly to 0 on the graph as $t\to \infty$.
Our assumption on the Lipschitz norm is equivalent to the assumption that the
underlying Lagrangian potential $u$ is uniformly convex with its Hessian
bounded in $L^\infty$. We apply this result to prove a Bernstein type theorem

smooth translating soliton, then it must be a flat plane. We also prove

scattered lights, a reflection component, and an iron-K emission line. There
are two distinct groups, three ""new type"" AGNs (including the two sources
reported by \citealt{Ueda2007}) with an extremely small scattered fraction
($f_{\rm{scat}} < 0.5%$) and strong reflection component ($R = \Omega / 2 \pi
\gtrsim 0.8$ where $\Omega$ is the solid angle of the reflector), and three
""classical type"" ones with $f_{\rm{scat}} > 0.5%$ and $R \lesssim 0.8$. The
spectral parameters suggest that the new type has an optically thick torus for
Thomson scattering ($N_{\rm{H}} \sim 10^{25} \rm{cm}^{-2}$) with a small
opening angle $\theta \sim 20^{\circ}$ viewed in a rather face-on geometry,

For pressure-less configurations, we find the marginal stability conclusions of
each treatment to be identical, confirming analytic results in the literature.
The tearing mode treatment also resolves ideal MHD unstable solutions for which
$\Delta' \to \infty$: these correspond to displacement of a resonant interface.
Wall stabilisation scans resolve the internal and external ideal kink. Scans
with increasing pressure are also performed: these indicate that both
variational and tearing mode treatments have the same stability trends with
$\beta$, and show pressure stabilisation in configurations with increasing edge
pressure. Combined, our results suggest that MRXMHD configurations which are
stable to ideal perturbations plus tearing modes are automatically in a stable
state. Such configurations, and their stability properties, are of emerging
importance in the quest to find mathematically rigorous solutions of ideal MHD
force balance in 3D geometry.

Rvir is the spherical infall estimate of the virial radius, covering about

stronger shocks (""external shocks"") is located farther out, at about 3 Rvir,

simulate SZ surface brightness maps of relaxed massive galaxy clusters drawn

Simultaneous solution of two-band light curves and radial velocities permits

NSVS 02502726 are in a circular orbit with 0.56-day orbital period and have
stellar masses of M$_1$=0.714$\pm$0.019 \Msun, and M$_2$=0.347$\pm$0.012 \Msun.
Both of the components have large radii, being R$_1$=0.67$\pm$0.01 \Rsun, and
R$_2$=0.76$\pm$0.01 \Rsun. The principal parameters of the mass and radius of
the component stars are found with an accuracy of 3% and 1%, respectively. The
secondary component's radius is significantly larger than model predictions for
its mass, similar to what is seen in almost all of the other well-studied
low-mass stars which belong to double-lined eclipsing binaries. Strong
H$_{\alpha}$ emission cores and considerable distortion at out-of-eclipse light
curve in both $R$ and $I$ bandpasses, presumably due to dark spots on both
stars, have been taken as an evidence of strong stellar activity. The distance
to system was calculated as 173$\pm$8 pc from the $BVRIJHK$ magnitudes. The
absolute parameters of the components indicate that both components are close
to the zero-age main-sequence. Comparison with current stellar evolution models
gives an age of 126 $\pm$30 Myr, indicating the stars are in the final stages

present a conceptually new approach to mitigation of RFI in interferometric

observations using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, India. However, the
concept can be used to excise RFI in any interferometer. Briefly, the
fringe-stopped correlator output of an interferometer baseline oscillates with
the fringe-stop period in the presence of RFI. RfiX works by identifying such a
pattern and subtracting it from the data. It is perhaps the only purely
software technique which can salvage the true visibility value from
RFI-corrupted data. It neither requires high-speed hardware nor real-time
processing and works best on normal correlator output integrated for 1-10s. It
complements other mitigation schemes with its different approach and the regime
it addresses. Its ability to work with data integrated over many seconds gives
it an advantage while excising weak, persistent RFI unlike most other
techniques which use high-speed sampling to localise RFI in time-frequency
plane. RfiX is also different in that it does not require RFI-free data to
identify corrupted sections. Some results from the application of RfiX is
presented including an image at 240 MHz with a Peak/noise ratio of 43000, the

stationary, or H-minimal, if it is a critical point of the volume functional
under Hamiltonian deformations. It is called Hamiltonian stable if in addition
the second variation of volume under Hamiltonian deformations is nonnegative.
  Our main result is that if L is a compact, Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian
in C^n satisfying the extra condition of being Hamiltonian rigid, then for any
M,w,g as above there exist compact Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangians L' in M
contained in a small ball about some p in M and locally modelled on tL for
small t>0, identifying M near p with C^n near 0. If L is Hamiltonian stable, we
can take L' to be Hamiltonian stable.
  Applying this to known examples L in C^n shows that there exist families of
Hamiltonian stable, Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangians diffeomorphic to T^n,
and to (S^1 x S^{n-1})/{1,-1}, and with other topologies, in every compact
symplectic 2n-manifold (M,w) with compatible metric g.

disordered harmonic crystals in a slab geometry, connected at the boundaries to
stochastic white noise heat baths at different temperatures.The disorder causes
short wavelength phonon modes to be localized so the heat current in this
system is carried by the extended phonon modes which can be either diffusive or
ballistic. Using ideas both from localization theory and from kinetic theory we
estimate the contribution of various modes to the heat current and from this we
obtain the asymptotic system size dependence of the current. These estimates
are compared with results obtained from a numerical evaluation of an exact
formula for the current, given in terms of a frequency transmission function,
as well as from direct nonequilibrium simulations. These yield a strong
dependence of the heat flux on boundary conditions. Our analytical arguments
show that for realistic boundary conditions the conductivity is finite in three
dimensions but we are not able to verify this numerically, except in the case
where the system is subjected to an external pinning potential. This case is
closely related to the problem of localization of electrons in a random
potential and here we numerically verify that the pinned three dimensional
system satisfies Fourier's law while the two dimensional system is a heat
insulator. We also investigate the inverse participation ratio of different
normal modes.

Adiabaticity is destroyed when a parameter crosses a critical value, even at

direction of the sweep. We apply our recent analysis [A.P. Itin, P. Torma,

(in a context of Feshbach resonance passage) to dissociation of molecules. On a

the system to a Painlev\'e equation allows us to calculate deviation from

are intimately connected. An important point is that the Lorentz force is
nearly compensated by the electric force therefore the acceleration zone spans
a large range of scales. We derived the asymptotic equations describing
relativistic, axisymmetric MHD flows far beyond the light cylinder. These
equations do not contain either intrinsic small scales (like the light cylinder
radius) or terms that nearly cancel each other (like the electric and magnetic
forces) therefore they could be easily solved numerically. They also suit well
for qualitative analysis of the flow and in many cases, they could even be
solved analytically or semi-analytically. We show that there are generally two
collimation regimes. In the first regime, the residual of the hoop stress and
the electric force is counterbalanced by the pressure of the poloidal magnetic
field so that at any distance from the source, the structure of the flow is the
same as the structure of an appropriate cylindrical equilibrium configuration.
In the second regime, the pressure of the poloidal magnetic field is negligible
small so that the flow could be conceived as composed from coaxial shrinking
magnetic loops. In the two collimation regimes, the flow is accelerated in
different ways. We study in detail the structure of jets confined by the
external pressure with a power law profile. In particular, we obtained simple
scalings for the extent of the acceleration zone, for the terminal Lorentz
factor and for the collimation angle.

depolarized dynamic light scattering (DDLS). The systems under study consist of
a solid core of polystyrene and a thermosensitive shell of cross-linked
poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPA) without and with embedded palladium
nanoparticles. PNIPA is soluble in water, but has a lower critical solution
temperature at 32 C (LCST). Below the LCST the PNIPA shell is swollen. Here we
find that besides translational and rotational diffusion, the particles exhibit
additional dynamics resulting from shape fluctuations. This leads to a
pronounced apparent increase of the rotational diffusion coefficient. Above the
transition temperature the shell collapses and provides a rather tight envelope
of the core. In this state the dynamics of the shell is frozen and the
core-shell particles behave like hard spheres. A simple physical model is

the radio number counts below 1 mJy is mostly due to star forming galaxies,
these sources and AGN make up an approximately equal fraction of the
sub--millijansky sky, contrary to some previous results. We have also uncovered
a population of distant AGN systematically missing from many previous studies
of sub-millijansky radio source identifications. The AGN include radio
galaxies, mostly of the low-power, Fanaroff-Riley I type, and a significant
radio-quiet component, which amounts to approximately one fifth of the total

attributable to metallicity in these clusters and M15. On the red giant branch,
emission in Halpha generally appears in stars with T_eff < 4500 K and log
L/L_sun > 2.75. Fainter stars showing emission are asymptotic giant branch
(AGB) stars or perhaps binary stars. The line-bisector for Halpha reveals the
onset of chromospheric expansion in stars more luminous than log L/L_sun ~ 2.5
in all clusters, and this outflow velocity increases with stellar luminosity.
However, the coolest giants in the metal-rich M13 show greatly reduced outflow
in Halpha most probably due to decreased T_eff and changing atmospheric
structure. The Ca K_3 outflow velocities are larger than shown by Halpha at the
same luminosity and signal accelerating outflows in the chromospheres. Stars
clearly on the AGB show faster chromospheric outflows in Halpha than RGB
objects. While the Halpha velocities on the RGB are similar for all
metallicities, the AGB stars in the metal-poor M15 and M92 have higher outflow
velocities than in the metal-rich M13. Comparison of these chromospheric line
profiles in the paired metal-poor clusters, M15 and M92 shows remarkable

infrared-luminous galaxies obtained with the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS)

Survey (ELAIS) with S15 > 0.8 mJy and photometric or spectroscopic z > 1. About
half of the sample are QSOs in the optical, while the remaining sources are
galaxies, comprising both obscured AGN and starbursts. We classify the spectra
using well-known infrared diagnostics, as well as a new one that we propose,
into three types of source: those dominated by an unobscured AGN (QSOs),
obscured AGN, and starburst-dominated sources. Starbursts concentrate at z ~
0.6-1.0 favored by the shift of the 7.7-micron PAH band into the selection 15
micron band, while AGN spread over the 0.5 < z < 3.1 range. Star formation
rates (SFR) are estimated for individual sources from the luminosity of the PAH
features. An estimate of the average PAH luminosity in QSOs and obscured AGN is
obtained from the composite spectrum of all sources with reliable redshifts.
The estimated mean SFR in the QSOs is 50-100 Mo yr^-1, but the implied FIR
luminosity is 3-10 times lower than that obtained from stacking analysis of the
FIR photometry, suggesting destruction of the PAH carriers by energetic photons
from the AGN. The SFR estimated in obscured AGN is 2-3 times higher than in
QSOs of similar MIR luminosity. This discrepancy might not be due to luminosity
effects or selection bias alone, but could instead indicate a connection
between obscuration and star formation. However, the observed correlation
between silicate absorption and the slope of the near- to mid-infrared spectrum
is compatible with the obscuration of the AGN emission in these sources being
produced in a dust torus.

the context of recent measurements of firing dynamics in 2D neuronal cultures.
There are two regimes, depending on the graph size N. Large metric graphs are
ignited by the occurrence of critical nuclei, which initially occupy an
infinitesimal fraction, f_* -> 0, of the graph and then explode throughout a
finite fraction. Smaller metric graphs are effectively random in the sense that
their ignition requires the initial ignition of a finite, unlocalized fraction
of the graph, f_* >0. The crossover between the two regimes is at a size N_*
which scales exponentially with the connectivity range \lambda like_* \sim
\exp\lambda^d. The neuronal cultures are finite metric graphs of size N \simeq
10^5-10^6, which, for the parameters of the experiment, is effectively random
since N<< N_*. This explains the seeming contradiction in the observed finite
f_* in these cultures. Finally, we discuss the dynamics of the firing front.

J17098-3628, by the All Sky Monitor on board the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer,
has shown that it displays a long term (~163d) quasi-periodic modulation in the
data spanning its ""active"" state (i.e. approximately MJD 53450-54200).
Furthermore, this light-curve is not typical of ""classical"" soft X-ray
transients, in that J17098-3628 has remained active since its initial
discovery, and may be more akin to the pseudo-transient EXO0748-676, which is
now classified as a persistent Low Mass X-ray Binary. However, EXO0748-676
recently entered a more active phase (since approximately MJD 53050), since
when we find that it too displays a quasi-periodic modulation (~181d) in its
light-curve. This must be a ""superorbital"" modulation, as the orbital period of
EXO0748-676 is well established (3.8hrs), and hence we interpret both objects'
long periods as representing some intrinsic properties of the accretion disc
(such as coupled precessional and warping effects). By analogy, we therefore
suggest that IGR J17098-3628 is another member of this class of
pseudo-transient LMXBs and is likely to have a <1d orbital period.

identifies 38 of these as members of the Coma cluster, evenly split between AGN
and star-forming galaxies (SFG). The radio-detected SFG are the dominant
population only for ~21 < log(L) < ~22 W/Hz, an interesting result given that
star formation dominates field RLFs for log(L) < ~23. The majority of the
radio-detected SFGs have characteristics of starbursts, including high specific
star formation rates and optical spectra with strong emission lines. In
conjunction with prior studies on post-starburst galaxies within the Coma
cluster, this is consistent with a picture in which late-type galaxies entering
Coma undergo a starburst prior to a rapid cessation of star formation.
Optically bright elliptical galaxies (Mr <= -20.5) make the largest
contribution to the radio luminosity function at both the high (log(L) >~ 22.48
W/Hz) and low (log(L) <~ 21 W/Hz) ends. Through a stacking analysis of these
optically-bright ellipticals we find that they continue to harbor radio sources
down to log(L) = 19.48. However, contrary to published results for the Virgo
cluster we find no evidence for the existence of a population of optically
faint (Mr ~ -14) dwarf ellipticals hosting strong radio AGN.

In order to study which coupling allows fast energy transfer to lattice
vibrations in correlated electron systems, we calculate the time evolutions of
the kinetic energies of different types and frequencies of lattice vibrations.
The one-dimensional half-filled Hubbard model is augmented with
electron-lattice couplings that modulate transfer integrals, site energies, and
Coulomb repulsion strengths. The time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation is
solved for exact many-electron wave functions, and the classical equation of
motion for the lattice displacements. In order to transfer energy to classical
lattice vibrations that modulate transfer integrals or site energies, the
translational invariance must be broken to give optical activity to an
electronic excitation with wave number $ \pi $ and to these lattice vibrations.
On the other hand, a certain amount of energy is always transferred to lattice
vibrations that modulate Coulomb repulsion strengths, irrespective of the
symmetry of the ground state, as long as the corresponding electron-lattice
couplings are present. In strongly correlated electron systems, these couplings
can be strong, although they are usually insignificant because their effects on
the equilibrium properties can be absorbed into redefinition of Coulomb
repulsion strengths. We will discuss competition or collaboration between
energy transfer pathways through different types of electron-lattice couplings.

by Swift. The source was soon confirmed by several groups in space- and
ground-based multi-wavelength observations. In this letter we report the
analysis of five short bursts from the recently discovered SGR, detected with
Konus-Wind gamma-ray burst spectrometer. Properties of the time histories of
the observed events, as well as results of multi-channel spectral analysis,
both in the 20--300 keV energy range, show, that the source exhibits itself as
a typical SGR. The bursts durations are <0.75 s and their spectra above 20 keV
can be fitted by optically-thin thermal bremsstrahlung (OTTB) model with kT of
20--40 keV. The spectral evolution is observed, which resembles the SGR 1627-41
bursts, where a strong hardness-intensity correlation was noticed in the
earlier Konus-Wind observations. The peak energy fluxes of all five events are
comparable to highest those for known SGRs, so a less distant source is
implied, consistent with the determined Galactic anti-center direction.
Supposing the young supernova remnant HB9 (at the distance of 1.5 kpc) as a
natal environment of the source, the peak luminosities of the bursts are
estimated to be (2--5)x10^{40} erg s-1. The values of the total energy release,
given the same assumptions, amount to (0.6--6)x10^{39} erg. These estimations
of both parameters are typical for short SGR bursts.

(age, metallicity and the alpha-element enhancement [E/Fe]) and morphologies of
red-sequence galaxies in 24 clusters and groups from z~0.75 to z~0.45. The
dataset, consisting of 215 spectra drawn from the ESO Distant Cluster Survey,
constitutes the largest spectroscopic sample at these redshifts for which such
an analysis has been conducted. Analysis reveals that the evolution of the
stellar population properties of red-sequence galaxies depend on their mass:
while the properties of most massive are well described by passive evolution
and high-redshift formation, the less massive galaxies require a more extended
star formation history. We show that these scenarios reproduce the index-sigma
relations as well as the galaxy colours. The two main results of this work are
(1) the evolution of the line-strength indices for the red-sequence galaxies
can be reproduced if 40% of the galaxies with sigma < 175 km/s entered the
red-sequence between z=0.75 to z=0.45, in agreement with the fraction derived
in studies of the luminosity functions, and (2) the percentage the red-sequence
galaxies exhibiting early-type morphologies (E and S0) decreases by 20% from
z=0.75 to z=0.45. This can be understood if the red-sequence gets populated at
later times with disc galaxies whose star formation has been quenched. We
conclude that the processes quenching star formation do not necessarily produce
a simultaneous morphological transformation of the galaxies entering the
red-sequence.

coaction of a Hopf algebra replacing the action of a group. Galois extensions
with respect to a group $G$ are the Hopf-Galois extensions with respect to the
dual of the group algebra of $G$. Rognes recently defined an analogous notion
of Hopf-Galois extensions in the category of structured ring spectra, motivated
by the fundamental example of the unit map from the sphere spectrum to $MU$.
  This article introduces a theory of homotopic Hopf-Galois extensions in a
monoidal category with compatible model category structure that generalizes the
case of structured ring spectra. In particular, we provide explicit examples of
homotopic Hopf-Galois extensions in various categories of interest to
topologists, showing that, for example, a principal fibration of simplicial
monoids is a homotopic Hopf-Galois extension in the category of simplicial
sets. We also investigate the relation of homotopic Hopf-Galois extensions to
descent.

on an infinite-dimensional space, the Thoma simplex. The family depends on
three continuous parameters, one of which, the Jack parameter, is similar to
the beta parameter in random matrix theory. The processes arise in a scaling
limit transition from certain finite Markov chains, the so called up-down
chains on the Young graph with the Jack edge multiplicities. Each of the limit
Markov processes is ergodic and its stationary distribution is a symmetrizing
measure. The infinitesimal generators of the processes are explicitly computed;
viewed as selfadjoint operators in the L^2 spaces over the symmetrizing
measures, the generators have purely discrete spectrum which is explicitly
described.
  For the special value 1 of the Jack parameter, the limit Markov processes
coincide with those of the recent work by Borodin and the author (Prob. Theory
Rel. Fields 144 (2009), 281--318; arXiv:0706.1034). In the limit as the Jack
parameter goes to 0, our family of processes degenerates to the one-parameter
family of diffusions on the Kingman simplex studied long ago by Ethier and
Kurtz in connection with some models of population genetics.
  The techniques of the paper are essentially algebraic. The main computations
are performed in the algebra of shifted symmetric functions with the Jack
