(BI) transition of strongly interacting fermionic atoms in an optical lattice
at a filling of two fermions per well. We present physical arguments to show
that a consistent mean field description of this problem is obtained by
retaining only intraband pairing between the fermions. Using this approach we
obtain a reasonable account of the experimentally observed critical lattice
depth for the SF-BI transition and the modulated components of the condensate
density, and make predictions for the lattice depth dependence of the
quasiparticle gap which can be tested in future experiments. We also highlight
some interesting features unique to cold atom superfluids within this intraband
pairing approximation; for instance, the pair field is forced to be uniform in
space and the Hartree field vanishes identically. These arise as a result of
the fact that while the pairing interaction is cut off at the scale of the
Debye frequency in conventional superconductors, or at the lattice scale in
tight binding model Hamiltonians, such a cutoff is absent for cold Fermi gases.

suggesting a perturbative model for large-scale clustering of galaxies (or
other dark matter tracers), in which the galaxy density is written as a Taylor
series in the local mass density, delta, with the unknown coefficients in the
series treated as free ""bias"" parameters. We extend this model to include
dependence of the galaxy density on the local values of nabla_i nabla_j phi and
nabla_i v_j, where phi is the potential and v is the peculiar velocity. We show
that only two new free parameters are needed to model the power spectrum and
bispectrum up to 4th order in the initial density perturbations, once symmetry
considerations and equivalences between possible terms are accounted for. One
of the new parameters is a bias multiplying s_ij s_ji, where s_ij=[nabla_i
nabla_j \nabla^-2 - 1/3 delta^K_ij] delta. The other multiplies s_ij t_ji,
where t_ij=[nabla_i nabla_j nabla^-2 - 1/3 delta^K_ij](theta-delta), with
theta=-(a H dlnD/dlna)^-1 nabla_i v_i. (There are other, observationally
equivalent, ways to write the two terms, e.g., using theta-delta instead of
s_ij s_ji.) We show how short-range (non-gravitational) non-locality can be
included through a controlled series of higher derivative terms, starting with
R^2 nabla^2 delta, where R is the scale of non-locality (this term will be a
small correction as long as k^2 R^2 is small, where k is the observed
wavenumber). We suggest that there will be much more information in future huge
redshift surveys in the range of scales where beyond-linear perturbation theory
is both necessary and sufficient than in the fully linear regime.

earlier paper. We work out the consequences of this proposal for the lowest
mode, viz. the tachyon. The action can be calculated for generic momenta,
perturbatively, order by order in the tachyon field. For on shell tachyons we
explicitly calculate the cubic action and show that it reproduces the correct
equations of motion and coincides wih the $\beta$ function to the required
order. The calculation is done in terms of bare fields with a finite cutoff,
which is the original prescription. We also show that it is possible in some
momentum regions to renormalize the theory and eliminate the cutoff dependence
so that the continuum limit can be taken. After renormalization, the parameter
$R\over a$ is replaced by $R\over L$ where $R$ is an IR cutoff, $a$ is the UV
cutoff and $L$ is some renormalization scale. There is also some arbitrariness
in the overall normalization due to the choice of regularization scheme - this
does not affect on-shell quantities. We also rederive within this scheme, the
action in the region of zero momentum, which gives the exact (tree level)
tachyon potential. The tachyon potential is consistent with Sen's conjecture
that the height of the potential is the same as the tension of the brane.

is also achieved using two operators, related to the parabosonic total number

ordinary Hopf algebra, producing thus two different variants of $P_{B}$, with

ignition of a pure deuterium micro-explosion an intense GeV ion beam can be

superfluid neutron stars. Our analysis accounts for the centrifugal deformation
of the star, and considers the two-fluid dynamics at linear order in the
perturbed velocities. Our main focus is on a simple model system where the
total density profile is that of an $n=1$ polytrope. We derive a partially
analytic solution for the superfluid analogue of the classical r-mode. This
solution is used to analyse the relevance of the vortex mediated mutual
friction damping, confirming that this dissipation mechanism is unlikely to
suppress the gravitational-wave driven instability in rapidly spinning
superfluid neutron stars. Our calculation of the superfluid r-modes is
significantly simpler than previous approaches, because it decouples the r-mode
from all other inertial modes of the system. This leads to the results being
clearer, but it also means that we cannot comment on the relevance of potential
avoided crossings (and associated ""resonances"") that may occur for particular
parameter values. Our analysis of the mutual friction damping differs from
previous studies in two important ways. Firstly, we incorporate realistic
pairing gaps which means that the regions of superfluidity in the star's core
vary with temperature. Secondly, we allow the mutual friction parameters to
take the whole range of permissible values rather than focussing on a
particular mechanism. Thus, we consider not only the weak drag regime, but also
the strong drag regime where the fluid dynamics is significantly different.

is a subject in which mathematical and conceptual reasoning can not be
separated, instructors of physics face the problem of finding suitable advise
on the most effective methods of teaching physics (i.e. how much time should be

quantitative reasoning, and how to teach both in a unitary way). In spite the

region of an ordinary quasar with 881 optical brightness measurements made
during the epoch 1993 - 1999. We find evidence for systematic trends having the
character of a pattern of reverberations following an initial disturbance. The
initial pulses have brightness increases of order 20% and pulse widths of 50
days, and the reverberations have typical amplitudes of 12% with longer mean
pulse widths of order 80 days and pulse separations of order 90 days. The
repeat pattern occurs over the same time scales whether the initial disturbance
is a brightening or fading. The lags of the pulse trains are comparable to the
lags seen previously in reverberation of the broad blue-shifted emission lines
following brightness disturbances in Seyfert galaxies, when allowance is made
for the mass of the central object. In addition to the burst pulse trains, we
find evidence for a semi-periodicity with a time scale of 2 years. These strong
patterns of brightness fluctuations suggest a method of discovering quasars
from photometric monitoring alone, with data of the quality expected from large

to construct low order conforming finite elements for the bi-wave equation.

allow and not allow construction of low order conforming finite elements for
approximating the bi-wave equation. We then construct a cubic and a quartic

positive and negative curvature, we find a correlation between curvature and
dark energy that leads to an extended region of preferred values. Our universe

bulges that operates during epochs of radio-loud quasar activity. In the radio
cores of relativistic quasar jets, internal shocks convert a fraction of
ordered bulk kinetic energy into randomized relativistic ions, or in other
words cosmic rays. By employing a phenomenologically-motivated jet model, we
show that enough 1-100 GeV cosmic rays escape the radio core into the host
galaxy to break the Eddington limit in cosmic rays. As a result, hydrostatic
balance is lost and a cosmic ray momentum-driven wind develops, expelling gas
from the host galaxy and thus self-limiting the black hole and bulge growth.
Although the interstellar cosmic ray power is much smaller than the quasar
photon luminosity, cosmic rays provide a stronger feedback than UV photons,
since they exchange momentum with the galactic gas much more efficiently. The
amount of energy released into the host galaxy as cosmic rays, per unit of
black hole rest mass energy, is independent of black hole mass. It follows that
radio-loud jets should be more prevalent in relatively massive systems since
they sit in galaxies with relatively deep gravitational potentials. Therefore,
jet-powered cosmic ray feedback not only self-regulates the black hole and
bulge growth, but also provides an explanation for the lack of radio-loud
activity in relatively small galaxies. By employing basic known facts regarding
the physical conditions in radio cores, we approximately reproduce both the
slope and the normalization of the M_{BH}-M_{Bulge} relation.

its origin in the four dimensional effective two-field version of the

dimensional space-time. We show that this interaction term could indeed enable
the dark energy equation of state parameter $\wx$ to cross the $\L$-barrier
(i.e., $\wx = -1$), keeping the Hamiltonian well behaved (bounded from below),
as well as satisfying the condition of stability of cosmological density
perturbations, i.e., the positivity of the squares of the sound speeds
corresponding to the adiabatic and entropy modes. The model is found to fit
well with the latest Supernova Union data and the WMAP results. The best fit
curve for $\wx$ crosses -1 at red-shift $z$ in the range $\sim 0.215 - 0.245$,

surprising, however, is the detection of silicate emission in a few type 2 AGN.
By combining Gemini and Spitzer mid-infrared imaging and spectroscopy of NGC
2110, the closest known Seyfert 2 galaxy with silicate emission features, we
can constrain the location of the silicate emitting region to within 32 pc of
the nucleus. This is the strongest constraint yet on the size of the silicate
emitting region in a Seyfert galaxy of any type. While this result is
consistent with a narrow line region origin for the emission, comparison with
clumpy torus models demonstrates that emission from an edge-on torus can also
explain the silicate emission features and 2-20 micron spectral energy
distribution of this object. In many of the best-fitting models the torus has
only a small number of clouds along the line of sight, and does not extend far
above the equatorial plane. Extended silicate-emitting regions may well be
present in AGN, but this work establishes that emission from the torus itself
is also a viable option for the origin of silicate emission features in active

(5 kpc < r < 20 kpc) and implied merger rate. In common with some recent
studies we find that the fraction of paired systems that could result in major
mergers is low (~4%) and does not increase significantly with redshift to
z~1.2, with (1+z)^{1.6 \pm 1.6}. Our key finding is that massive galaxies with
M_* > 1E11 Msun are more likely to host merging companions than less massive
systems (M_* ~ 1E10 Msun). We find evidence for a higher pair fraction for red,
spheroidal hosts compared to blue, late-type systems, in line with expectations
based on clustering at small scales. So-called ""dry"" mergers between early-type
galaxies represent nearly 50% of close pairs with M_* > 3E10 Msun at z~0.5, but
less than 30% at z~1. This result can be explained by the increasing abundance
of red, early-type galaxies at these masses. We compare the volumetric merger
rate of galaxies with different masses to mass-dependent trends in galaxy
evolution, finding that major mergers cannot fully account for the formation of
spheroidal galaxies since z~1. In terms of mass assembly, major mergers
contribute little to galaxy growth below M_* ~ 3E10 Msun but are more
significant among galaxies with M_* > 1E11 Msun, 30% of which have undergone
mostly dry mergers over the observed redshift range. Overall, the relatively
more rapid coalescence of high mass galaxies mirrors the expected hierarchical
growth of halos and is consistent with recent model predictions, even if the
downsizing of star formation and morphological evolution involves additional
physical processes.

discussing the entropy of eternal AdS black holes in dimension four and above

of a certain function of the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) mass and the

Schwarzschild limit) the quantized function becomes the horizon area and in the
limit of a large cosmological constant it approaches the ADM mass of the black
holes. We show that in the Schwarzschild limit the area quatization leads to
the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy if Boltzmann statistics are employed. In the
limit of a large cosmological constant the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy can be
recovered only via Bose statistics. The two limits are separated by a first
order phase transition, which seems to suggest a shift from ""particle-like""
degrees of freedom at large cosmological constant to geometric degrees of
freedom as the cosmological constant approaches zero.

international meeting of epidemiologists. It centered on a concern, perhaps
widely spread, that measurement error adjustment methods can induce positive
bias in results of epidemiological studies when there is no true association. I
trace the possible history of this supposition and test it in a simulation
study of both continuous and binary health outcomes under a classical
multiplicative measurement error model. A Bayesian measurement adjustment
method is used. The main conclusion is that adjustment for the presumed
measurement error does not 'induce' positive associations, especially if the
focus of the interpretation of the result is taken away from the point
estimate. This is in line with properties of earlier measurement error
adjustment methods introduced to epidemiologists in the 1990s. An heuristic
argument is provided to support the generalizability of this observation in the
Bayesian framework. I find that when there is no true association, positive
bias can only be induced by indefensible manipulation of the priors, such that
they dominate the data. The misconception about bias induced by measurement
error adjustment should be more clearly explained during the training of
epidemiologists to ensure the appropriate (and wider) use of measurement error
correction procedures. The simple message that can be derived from this paper
is: 'Do not focus on point estimates, but mind the gap between boundaries that
reflect variability in the estimate'. And of course: 'Treat measurement error
as a tractable problem that deserves much more attention than just a
qualitative (throw-away) discussion'.

using reduced-order models of the governing equations, linearized about a
possibly unstable steady state. The reduced models are obtained using an
approximate balanced truncation method that retains the most controllable and
observable modes of the system. The original method is valid only for stable
linear systems, and we present an extension to unstable linear systems. The
dynamics on the unstable subspace are represented by projecting the original
equations onto the global unstable eigenmodes, assumed to be small in number. A
snapshot-based algorithm is developed, using approximate balanced truncation,
for obtaining a reduced-order model of the dynamics on the stable subspace. The
proposed algorithm is used to study feedback control of 2-D flow over a flat
plate at a low Reynolds number and at large angles of attack, where the natural
flow is vortex shedding, though there also exists an unstable steady state. For
control design, we derive reduced-order models valid in the neighborhood of
this unstable steady state. The actuation is modeled as a localized body force
near the leading edge of the flat plate, and the sensors are two velocity
measurements in the near-wake of the plate. A reduced-order Kalman filter is
developed based on these models and is shown to accurately reconstruct the flow
field from the sensor measurements, and the resulting estimator-based control
is shown to stabilize the unstable steady state. For small perturbations of the
steady state, the model accurately predicts the response of the full
simulation. Furthermore, the resulting controller is even able to suppress the
stable periodic vortex shedding, where the nonlinear effects are strong, thus
implying a large domain of attraction of the stabilized steady state.

Sasa-Satsuma equation whose spectral operator is a $3\times 3$ system, while
its linearized operator is a $2\times 2$ system. It is shown that these squared
eigenfunctions are sums of two terms, where each term is a product of a Jost
function and an adjoint Jost function. The procedure of this derivation
consists of two steps: first is to calculate the variations of the potentials
via variations of the scattering data by the Riemann-Hilbert method. The second
one is to calculate the variations of the scattering data via the variations of
the potentials through elementary calculations. While this procedure has been
used before on other integrable equations, it is shown here, for the first
time, that for a general integrable equation, the functions appearing in these
variation relations are precisely the squared eigenfunctions and adjoint
squared eigenfunctions satisfying respectively the linearized equation and the
adjoint linearized equation of the integrable system. This proof clarifies this
procedure and provides a unified explanation for previous results of squared
eigenfunctions on individual integrable equations. This procedure uses
primarily the spectral operator of the Lax pair. Thus two equations in the same
integrable hierarchy will share the same squared eigenfunctions (except for a
time-dependent factor). In the Appendix, the squared eigenfunctions are
presented for the Manakov equations whose spectral operator is closely related
to that of the Sasa-Satsuma equation.

to examine the extraordinary behaviour displayed by 18 R Coronae Borealis (RCB)
stars in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs). RCB stars exhibit a unique variability
whereby they undergo rapid declines of up to several magnitudes. These are
thought to be caused by the formation of dust in the stellar environment which
reduces the brightness.
  The monitoring programme comprised the collection of UBVRI photometric data
using five telescopes located at three different southern hemisphere longitudes
(Las Campanas Observatory in Chile, Mount Joun University Observatory in New
Zealand, and the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) in South Africa).
  Examination of the data acquired in the V and I filters resulted in the
identification of a total of 18 RCB declines occurring in four stars.
Construction of colour-magnitude diagrams (V vs V-I), during the recovery to
maximum light were undertaken in order to study the unique colour behaviour
associated with the RCB declines. The combined recovery slope for the four
stars was determined to be 3.37+/-0.24, which is similar to the value of
3.1+/-0.1 calculated for galactic RCB stars (Skuljan et al. 2003). These
results may imply that the nature of the dust (i.e. the particle size) is
similar in both our Galaxy and the MCs.

slight improvement over the SQL. The required quantum states are generally
difficult to produce, and very prone to decoherence. Here we show that
decoherence itself may be used as an extremely sensitive probe of system

orthogonal multiaccess relay channels (MARCs) in which the users (sources)
communicate with a destination with the aid of a half-duplex relay that
transmits on a channel orthogonal to that used by the transmitting sources.
Under the assumption that the instantaneous fading state information is
available at all nodes, the maximum sum-rate and the optimal user and relay
power allocations (policies) are developed for a decode-and-forward (DF) relay.
With the observation that a DF relay results in two multiaccess channels, one
at the relay and the other at the destination, a single known lemma on the
sum-rate of two intersecting polymatroids is used to determine the DF sum-rate
and the optimal user and relay policies. The lemma also enables a broad
topological classification of fading MARCs into one of three types. The first
type is the set of partially clustered MARCs where a user is clustered either
with the relay or with the destination such that the users waterfill on their
bottle-neck links to the distant receiver. The second type is the set of
clustered MARCs where all users are either proximal to the relay or to the
destination such that opportunistic multiuser scheduling to one of the
receivers is optimal. The third type consists of arbitrarily clustered MARCs
which are a combination of the first two types, and for this type it is shown
that the optimal policies are opportunistic non-waterfilling solutions. The
analysis is extended to develop the rate region of a K-user orthogonal
half-duplex MARC. Finally, cutset outer bounds are used to show that DF

[32] for an obliquely rotating magnetic dipole, to incorporate the effect of
the gravitational mass. So, by using the numerical and analytical solutions of
the differential equation for the radiation, we construct the energy spectra
for different masses of the dipole-NS. These spectra show that, in relatively
low angular momentum l, the effect of the gravitational mass is very
significant in suppressing the relativistic enhancement factor, which had been
found [27, 28, 32], by two to three orders of magnitude, as the mass changes
from 0.5 solar mass to 3 solar masses. It is an indication that most of the
angular momentum of the NS is retained as rotational kinetic energy instead of
being radiated as an electromagnetic energy. Also, the suppressing in radiation
energy is more or less independent of the angular momentum, and the high
rotational velocity. We also found that electromagnetic energy is proportional
to square of sin(inclination angle the obliquity) which is similar to the
classical behavior. However, in the very high angular momentum, the whole
radiation suppresses and the effect of mass is neglected. It indicates that the
(special) relativistic enhancement expected is lost to the (general)
relativistic increase of angular momentum after incorporating the effect of
mass.

can be easily specialized to discover serial or parallel episodes. Also, the
algorithms are flexible enough to be specialized for mining in the space of

inherent combinatorial explosion in frequent partial order mining and most
importantly, frequency alone is not a sufficient measure of interestingness. We
propose a new interestingness measure for general partial order episodes and a

relationship with other CME-associated phenomena and to compare these
observations with observables predicted by a model of partially-expelled flux
ropes (Gibson & Fan, 2006a, b).
  METHODS: We have studied 6 selected events with partially-erupting
prominences using multi wavelength observations recorded by the
Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT), Transition Region and Coronal
Explorer (TRACE), Mauna Loa Solar Observatory (MLSO), Big Bear Solar
Observatory (BBSO) and soft X-ray telescope (SXT). The observational features
associated with partially-erupting prominences were then compared with the
predicted observables from the model.
  RESULTS: The partially-expelled-flux-rope (PEFR) model of Gibson & Fan
(2006a, b) can explain the partial eruption of these prominences, and in
addition predicts a variety of other CME-related observables that provide
evidence for internal reconnection during eruption. We find that all of the
partially-erupting prominences studied in this paper exhibit indirect evidence
for internal reconnection. Moreover, all cases showed evidence of at least one
observable unique to the PEFR model, e.g., dimmings external to the source
region, and/or a soft X-ray cusp overlying a reformed sigmoid.
  CONCLUSIONS: The PEFR model provides a plausible mechanism to explain the
observed evolution of partially-erupting-prominence-associated CMEs in our
study.

The fraction of stirred particles allows to probe superfluidity of the system.
We find that it crosses over at a critical velocity, lower than the sound one,
from a characteristic power law at high velocities to a constant at low
velocities. Some experimental issues on quantum stirring in ring-trapped

  the interface of statistics and computing)",,,,"cs.OH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper has several objectives. First, it separates randomness from
lawlessness and shows why even genuine randomness does not imply lawlessness.
Second, it separates the question -why should I call a phenomenon random? (and
answers it in part one) from the patent question -What is a random sequence?
-for which the answer lies in Kolmogorov complexity (which is explained in part
two). While answering the first question the note argues why there should be
four motivating factors for calling a phenomenon random: ontic, epistemic,
pseudo and telescopic, the first two depicting genuine randomness and the last
two false. Third, ontic and epistemic randomness have been distinguished from
ontic and epistemic probability. Fourth, it encourages students to be applied
statisticians and advises against becoming armchair theorists but this is
interestingly achieved by a straight application of telescopic randomness.
Overall, it tells (the teacher) not to jump to probability without explaining
randomness properly first and similarly advises the students to read (and
understand) randomness minutely before taking on probability.

nanoribbons) is described as the superposition of two non-equivalent Dirac
points of graphene. In spite of the lack of well-separated two valley
structures, the single-channel transport subjected to long-ranged impurities is
nearly perfectly conducting, where the backward scattering matrix elements in
the lowest order vanish as a manifestation of internal phase structures of the
wavefunction. For multi-channel energy regime, however, the conventional
exponential decay of the averaged conductance occurs. Since the inter-valley
scattering is not completely absent, armchair nanoribbons can be classified
into orthogonal universality class irrespective of the range of impurities. The
nearly perfect single-channel conduction dominates the low-energy electronic
transport in rather narrow nanorribbons.

In the stable (unzipped) phase, epoxy group breaks underneath sp2 bond and
modifies the mechanical and electronic properties of graphene remarkably. The
foldable epoxy ring structure reduces its Young's modulus by 42.4%, while
leaves the tensile strength almost unchanged. Epoxidation also perturbs the pi
