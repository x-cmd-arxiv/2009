Submitted to Physical Review D",,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We show that linear redshift distortions in the galaxy distribution can
affect the ISW galaxy-temperature signal, when the galaxy selection function is
derived from a redshift survey. We find this effect adds power to the ISW
signal at all redshifts and is larger at higher redshifts. Omission of this
effect leads to an overestimation of the dark energy density $\Omega_\Lambda$
as well as an underestimation of statistical errors. We find a new expression
for the ISW Limber equation which includes redshift distortions, though we find
that Limber equations for the ISW calculation are ill-suited for tomographic
calculations when the redshift bin width is small. The inclusion of redshift
distortions provides a new cosmological handle in the ISW spectrum, which can
help constrain dark energy parameters, curvature and alternative cosmologies.

periodic amplitude and/or phase modulation of their pulsation cycles. More than
a century after its discovery, this ""Blazhko effect"" still lacks acceptable
theoretical understanding. In one of the plausible models for explaining the
phenomenon, the modulation is caused by the effects of a magnetic field. So
far, the available observational data have not allowed us to either support nor
rule out the presence of a magnetic field in RR Lyrae stars. We intend to
determine whether RR Lyrae stars are generally characterized by the presence of
a magnetic field organized on a large scale. With the help of the FORS1
instrument at the ESO VLT we performed a spectropolarimetric survey of 17
relatively bright southern RR Lyrae stars, both Blazhko stars and non-modulated
stars, and determined their mean longitudinal magnetic field with a typical
error bar < 30 G. All our measurements of the mean longitudinal magnetic field
resulted in null detections within 3 sigma. From our data we can set an upper
limit for the strength of the dipole component of the magnetic fields of RR
Lyrae stars to ~ 130 G. Because of the limitations intrinsic to the diagnostic
technique, we cannot exclude the presence of higher order multipolar
components. The outcome of this survey clarifies that the Blazhko modulation in
the pulsation of RR Lyrae stars is not correlated with the presence of a
strong, quasi-dipolar magnetic field.

bringing together various fields. For each of these fields, various algorithms
and techniques, which have been developed to leverage sparsity, are described
succinctly. The common benefits of significant reduction in sampling rate and
processing manipulations are revealed.
  The key applications of sparse signal processing are sampling, coding,
spectral estimation, array processing, component analysis, and multipath
channel estimation. In terms of reconstruction algorithms, linkages are made
with random sampling, compressed sensing and rate of innovation. The redundancy
introduced by channel coding in finite/real Galois fields is then related to
sampling with similar reconstruction algorithms. The methods of Prony,
Pisarenko, and MUSIC are next discussed for sparse frequency domain
representations. Specifically, the relations of the approach of Prony to an
annihilating filter and Error Locator Polynomials in coding are emphasized; the
Pisarenko and MUSIC methods are further improvements of the Prony method. Such
spectral estimation methods is then related to multi-source location and DOA
estimation in array processing. The notions of sparse array beamforming and
sparse sensor networks are also introduced. Sparsity in unobservable source
signals is also shown to facilitate source separation in SCA; the algorithms
developed in this area are also widely used in compressed sensing. Finally, the
multipath channel estimation problem is shown to have a sparse formulation;
algorithms similar to sampling and coding are used to estimate OFDM channels.

nonclassical have been present in scientific literature for many years. The aim
of this note is to move from the domain of speculation to rigorous statistical
arguments in favor of probabilistic nonclassicality of the financial market. I
design a corresponding statistical test which is based on violation of the
formula of total probability (FTP). The latter is the basic in classical
probability and its violation would be a strong sign in favor of QL behavior at
the market.

cardinalities are members of $c$. We are interested in polyhedra associated
with those problems, in particular in inequalities that cut off solutions of
forbidden cardinality. Maurras (1977) and Camion and Maurras (1982) introduced
a family of inequalities, that we call forbidden set inequalities, which can be
used to cut off those solutions. However, these inequalities are in general not
facet defining for the polyhedron associated with $\Pi_c$. Kaibel and Stephan
(2007) showed how one can combine integer characterizations for cycle and path
polytopes and a modified form of forbidden set inequalities to give facet
defining integer representations for the cardinality restricted versions of
these polytopes. Motivated by this work, we apply the same approach on the
matroid polytope. It is well known that the so-called rank inequalities
together with the nonnegativity constraints provide a complete linear
description of the matroid polytope (see Edmonds (1971). By essentially adding
the forbidden set inequalities in an appropriate form, we obtain a complete
linear description of the cardinality constrained matroid polytope which is the
convex hull of the incidence vectors of those independent sets that have a
feasible cardinality. Moreover, we show how the separation problem for the
forbidden set inequalities can be reduced to that for the rank inequalities. We
also give necessary and sufficient conditions for a forbidden set inequality to

(MFV) in the lepton sector is revisited. To this end, the most general
parametrizations of the slepton soft-breaking terms are constructed assuming a
seesaw mechanism of type I. After a critical reassessment of how the
CP-symmetry is broken within the MFV framework, all possible CP-violating
phases are introduced. From the strong hierarchy of their contributions to the
Electric Dipole Moments (EDMs), these phases are split into three classes:
flavor-blind, flavor-diagonal and flavor off-diagonal. In particular, the
phases from the neutrino sector belong to the last class; they start to
contribute only at the second order in the mass-insertion approximation and
have thus a negligible effect. It is then shown that to each class of phases
corresponds a unique largely dominant term in the MFV expansion. Numerically,
for a realistic range of MSSM and neutrino parameters, such that B(mu --> e
gamma) does not exceed its experimental bound, the three types of phases are
found to be allowed by the current bound on the electron EDM, though the next
generation of experiments should constrain tightly the flavor-blind phase.
Finally, we relax the MFV hypothesis and show how in the general MSSM, the MFV
operator basis can be used to judge of the naturality of the slepton
soft-breaking terms.

parameters are fixed at their critical values. This scheme is studied using a
self-tuning variant of the Ising model. It is contrasted with a scheme where
systems approach criticality through a target value for the order parameter
that vanishes with increasing system size. In the former scheme, the universal
exponents are observed in naive finite-size scaling studies, whereas in the
latter they are not.

$d$-dimensional Hilbert space from a time-dependent Hamiltonian through a
combination of stochastic searches and geometric construction. The protocol is
based on the eigen-decomposition of the map. A unitary matrix can be
implemented by sequentially mapping each eigenvector to a fiducial state,
imprinting the eigenphase on that state, and mapping it back to the
eigenvector. This requires the design of only $d$ state-to-state maps generated
by control waveforms that are efficiently found by a gradient search with
computational resources that scale polynomially in $d$. In contrast, the
complexity of a stochastic search for a single waveform that simultaneously
acts as desired on all eigenvectors scales exponentially in $d$. We extend this
construction to design maps on an $n$-dimensional subspace of the Hilbert space
using only $n$ stochastic searches. Additionally, we show how these techniques
can be used to control atomic spins in the ground electronic hyperfine manifold
of alkali atoms in order to implement general qudit logic gates as well to
perform a simple form of error correction on an embedded qubit.

has a coverage probability larger than or equal to $1-\epsilon$. The numerical
experiments reported in the paper show that the length of the confidence set is

data-driven procedure for choosing the LASSO penalty. The selection power of

the existence of the Callan-Symanzik-Lifshitz equations and ii) the

behaviors at the same perturbative order. Similarly to the computation in the

dynamical response of thin disks to bombardment by cold dark matter (CDM)
substructure. Our method combines (1) cosmological simulations of the formation
of Milky Way (MW)-sized CDM halos to derive the properties of substructure and
(2) controlled numerical experiments of consecutive subhalo impacts onto an
initially-thin, fully-formed MW type disk galaxy. The present study is the
first to account for the evolution of satellite populations over cosmic time in
such an investigation of disk structure. We find that accretions of massive
subhalos onto the central regions of host halos, where the galactic disks
reside, since z~1 should be common. One host halo accretion history is used to
initialize the controlled simulations of satellite-disk encounters. We show
that these accretion events severely perturb the thin galactic disk and produce
a wealth of distinctive dynamical signatures on its structure and kinematics.
These include (1) considerable thickening and heating at all radii, with the
disk thickness and velocity ellipsoid nearly doubling at the solar radius; (2)
prominent flaring associated with an increase in disk thickness greater than a
factor of 4 in the disk outskirts; (3) surface density excesses at large radii,
beyond ~5 disk scale lengths, resembling those of observed antitruncated disks;
(4) lopsidedness at levels similar to those measured in observational samples
of disk galaxies; and (5) substantial tilting. The interaction with the most
massive subhalo drives the disk response while subsequent bombardment is much
less efficient at disturbing the disk. We conclude that substructure-disk
encounters of the kind expected in the LCDM paradigm play a significant role in
setting the structure of disk galaxies and driving galaxy evolution.

INTEGRAL and a member of the new class of HMXB, the Supergiant Fast X-ray
Transients (SFXTs). While INTEGRAL and RXTE observations have shown that the
outbursts occur with a periodicity of ~330 days, Swift data have recently
demonstrated that the true outburst period is ~165 days. IGR J11215-5952 is the
first discovered SFXT displaying periodic outbursts, which are possibly related
to the orbital period. We performed a Guest Investigator observation with Swift
that lasted 20ks and several follow-up Target of Opportunity (ToO)
observations, for a total of ~32ks, during the expected ""apastron"" passage
(defined assuming an orbital period of ~330 days), between 2008 June 16 and
July 4. The characteristics of this ""apastron'' outburst are quite similar to
those previously observed during the ""periastron'' outburst of 2007 February 9.
The mean spectrum of the bright peaks can be fit with an absorbed power law
model with a photon index of 1 and an absorbing column of 1E22 cm^-2. This
outburst reached luminosities of ~1E36 erg/s (1-10keV), comparable with the
ones measured in 2007. The light curve can be modelled with the parameters
obtained by Sidoli et al. (2007) for the 2007 February 9 outburst, although
some differences can be observed in its shape. The properties of the rise to
this new outburst and the comparison with the previous outbursts allow us to
suggest that the true orbital period of IGR J11215-5952 is very likely 164.6
days, and that the orbit is eccentric, with the different outbursts produced at
the periastron passage, when the neutron star crosses the inclined equatorial
wind from the supergiant companion. Based on a ToO observation performed on
2008 March 25-27, we can exclude that the period is 165/2 days. [Abridged]

independent models, i) an empirical halo occupation model which fits current
measurements of the clustering and luminosity function of galaxies at low and
high redshifts, and ii) the GALFORM semi-analytic model of galaxy formation,
which follows the evolution of the galaxy population from first principles,
adjusted to match the statistics of low and high redshift galaxies. In both
models we constrain the MgII halo sizes of field and cluster galaxies using
observational results on the observed MgII statistics. Our results for the
field are in good agreement with previous works, indicating a typical \mgii\
halo size of $r_MgII ~ 50h_71^-1kpc in the semi-analytic model, and slightly
lower in the halo occupation number approach. For the cluster environment, we
find that both models require a median MgII halo size of r_MgII< 10h_71^-1kpc
in order to reproduce the observed statistics on absorption line systems in
clusters of galaxies. Based on the Chen & Tinker (2008) result that stronger
systems occur closer to the MgII halo centre, we find that strong absorption
systems in clusters of galaxies occur at roughly a fixed fraction of the
cold-warm halo size out to 1h_71^-1Mpc from the cluster centres. In contrast,
weaker absorption systems appear to occur at progressively shorter relative
fractions of this halo as the distance to the cluster centre decreases.

also lower by a similar factor, compared to expectations for a non-evolving

build-up of intergalactic C IV over a period of only 300 Myr; such a build-up
could reflect the accumulation of metals associated with the rising levels of
star formation activity from z = 9 indicated by galaxy counts, and/or an
increasing degree of ionisation of the intergalactic medium (IGM), following
the overlap of ionisation fronts from star-forming regions. If the value of
Omega(C IV) we derive is typical of the IGM at large, it would imply a
metallicity Z(IGM) = 10^(-4) Z(Sun). The early-type stars responsible for
synthesising these metals would have emitted only about one Lyman continuum
photon per baryon prior to z = 5.8; such a background is insufficient to keep
the IGM ionised and we speculate on possible factors which could make up the
required shortfall.

radial motion into a wormhole after passing the event horizon is physically
different from the motion into a Schwarzschild black hole, Einstein-Rosen and
Schwarzschild black holes are different, physical realizations of general

show that timelike geodesics in the field of a wormhole are complete because
the expansion scalar in the Raychaudhuri equation has a discontinuity at the

doubly, special relativity (DSR) into a curved spacetime is a generalisation of
Einstein-Cartan theory, considered by Stelle and West. Instead of interpreting
the noncommuting ""spacetime coordinates"" of the Snyder algebra as endowing
spacetime with a fundamentally noncommutative structure, we are led to consider
a connection with torsion in this framework. This may lead to the usual
ambiguities in minimal coupling. We note that observable violations of charge
conservation induced by torsion should happen on a time scale of 10^3 s, which
seems to rule out these modifications as a serious theory. Our considerations
show, however, that the noncommutativity of translations in the Snyder algebra
need not correspond to noncommutative spacetime in the usual sense.

is based on multiple steps which make use of both radio and optical
constraints. The basic assumptions are that 1) the break in radio power between
low-power FRIs and the more powerful FRIIs does not change with redshift, and
2) that the photometric properties of the host galaxies of low power radio
galaxies in the distant universe are similar to those of FRIIs in the same
redshift bin, as is the case for nearby radio galaxies. We describe the results
of our search, which yields 37 low-power radio galaxy candidates that are
possibly FRIs. We show that a large fraction of these low-luminosity radio
galaxies display a compact radio morphology, that does not correspond to the
FRI morphological classification. Furthermore, our objects are apparently
associated with galaxies that show clear signs of interactions, at odds with
the typical behavior observed in low-z FRI hosts. The compact radio morphology
might imply that we are observing intrinsically small and possibly young
objects, that will eventually evolve into the giant FRIs we observe in the
local universe. One of the objects appears as point-like in HST images. This
might belong to a population of FRI-QSOs, which however would represent a tiny
minority of the overall population of high-z FRIs. As for the local FRIs, a
large fraction of our objects are likely to be associated with groups or
clusters, making them ""beacons"" for high redshift clusters of galaxies. Our
search for candidate high-z FRIs we present in this paper constitutes a pilot
study for objects to be observed with future high-resolution and
high-sensitivity instruments (shortened)

threshold at a density (namely, clause-variable ratio) of roughly 2^k\ln 2: at
densities slightly below this threshold almost all k-CNF formulas are
satisfiable whereas slightly above this threshold almost no k-CNF formula is
satisfiable. In the current work we consider satisfiable random formulas, and
inspect another parameter -- the diameter of the solution space (that is the
maximal Hamming distance between a pair of satisfying assignments).
  It was previously shown that for all densities up to a density slightly below
the satisfiability threshold the diameter is almost surely at least roughly n/2
(and n at much lower densities). At densities very much higher than the
satisfiability threshold, the diameter is almost surely zero (a very dense
satisfiable formula is expected to have only one satisfying assignment). In
this paper we show that for all densities above a density that is slightly
above the satisfiability threshold (more precisely at ratio (1+ \eps)2^k \ln 2,
\eps=\eps(k) tending to 0 as k grows) the diameter is almost surely
O(k2^{-k}n). This shows that a relatively small change in the density around
the satisfiability threshold (a multiplicative (1 + \eps) factor), makes a
dramatic change in the diameter. This drop in the diameter cannot be attributed
to the fact that a larger fraction of the formulas is not satisfiable (and
hence have diameter 0), because the non-satisfiable formulas are excluded from
consideration by our conditioning that the formula is satisfiable.

solar activity: in 1996 (at minimum), 1998 (rising phase), 2000 (at maximum)
and 2003 (declining phase). The results from the area with active regions show
that the lifetime decreases as activity increases. The maximal lifetime
variations are between solar minimum in 1996 and maximum in 2000; the relative
variation averaged over all mode degree values and frequencies is a decrease of
about 13%. The lifetime reductions relative to 1996 are about 7% in 1998 and
about 10% in 2003. The lifetime computed in the quiet region still decreases
with solar activity although the decrease is smaller. On average, relative to
1996, the lifetime decrease is about 4% in 1998, 10% in 2000 and 8% in 2003.
Thus, measured lifetime increases when regions of high magnetic activity are
avoided. Moreover, the lifetime computed in quiet regions also shows variations

up the drops spontaneously align to turn them into uniaxial nematic liquid
crystalline droplets. The nematic droplets or ""tactoids"" that are formed this
way are not spherical but elongated, resulting from the competition between the
anisotropic surface tension and the elastic deformation of the director field.
In agreement with recent theoretical predictions we find that sufficiently
small tactoids have a uniform director field, whilst large ones are
characterized by a bipolar director field. From the shape and director-field

considered a nemesis to be avoided due to strong absorption in the THz
frequency range. Here we report the first experimental demonstration and
theoretical implications of using femtosecond laser pulses to generate intense
broadband THz emission from water vapor. When we focused an intense laser pulse
in water vapor contained in a gas cell or injected from a gas jet nozzle, an
extraordinarily strong THz field from optically excited water vapor is
observed. Water vapor has more than 50% greater THz generation efficiency than
dry nitrogen. It had previously been assumed that the nonlinear generation of
THz waves in this manner primarily involves a free-electron plasma, but we show
that the molecular structure plays an essential role in the process. In
particular, we found that THz wave generation from H2O vapor is significantly
stronger than that from D2O vapor. Vibronic activities of water cluster ions,
occurring naturally in water vapor, may possibly contribute to the observed
isotope effect along with rovibrational contributions from the predominant
monomers.

activity within a population of neurons. Assuming that these neurons are driven
by a common fluctuating input with Gaussian statistics, we evaluate the
cross-correlation of spike trains in pairs of model neurons with different
thresholds. This correlation function tends to be asymmetric in time,
indicating a preference for the neuron with the lower threshold to fire before
the one with the higher threshold, even if their inputs are identical. The
relationship between these results and spike statistics in other models of
neural activity are explored. In particular, we compare our model with an
integrate-and-fire model in which the membrane voltage resets following each
spike. The qualitative properties of spike cross correlations, emerging from
the threshold-crossing model, are similar to those of bursting events in the
integrate-and-fire model. This is particularly true for generalized
integrate-and-fire models in which spikes tend to occur in bursts as observed,
for example, in retinal ganglion cells driven by a rapidly fluctuating visual
stimulus. The threshold crossing model thus provides a simple, analytically
tractable description of event onsets in these neurons.

strength the driven depinning transitions are continuous, and the sliding
velocity varies with the force from the threshold with power-law exponents in
agreement with analytical predictions. Transverse depinning transitions in the
moving state are also found in two dimensions. Surprisingly, for sufficiently
weak pinning potential we find a discontinuous depinning transition with
hysteresis even in one dimension under overdamped dynamics. We also

$f=-W'$ with $W$ bistable and balanced, for instance $W(u) =\frac 14

non-degenerate, in the sense that its bounded Jacobi fields are all originated
from rigid motions (this is known for instance for a Catenoid and for the
Costa-Hoffman-Meeks surface of any genus). We prove that for any small $\alpha
>0$, the Allen-Cahn equation has a family of bounded solutions depending on
$m-1$ parameters distinct from rigid motions, whose level sets are embedded
surfaces lying close to the blown-up surface $M_\alpha := \alpha^{-1} M$, with
ends possibly diverging logarithmically from $M_\A$. We prove that these

that their Morse index coincides with the index of the minimal surface. Our

power-law tail, has been a subject of intensive investigations in statistical
physics community. Several models have been employed to explain this behavior.
However, most of the agent based models assume the conservation of number of
agents and wealth. Both these assumptions are unrealistic. In this paper, we
study the limiting wealth distribution when one or both of these assumptions
are not valid. Given the universality of the law, we have tried to study the
wealth distribution from the asset exchange models point of view. We consider
models in which a) new agents enter the market at constant rate b) richer
agents fragment with higher probability introducing newer agents in the system
c) both fragmentation and entry of new agents is taking place. While models a)
and c) do not conserve total wealth or number of agents, model b) conserves
total wealth. All these models lead to a power-law tail in the wealth
distribution pointing to the possibility that more generalized asset exchange
models could help us to explain emergence of power-law tail in wealth
distribution.

measured by the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) that are in the LAT bright AGN
sample (LBAS). We find that the gamma-ray bright quasars have faster jets on
average than the non-LBAS quasars, with a median of 15 c, and values ranging up
to 34 c. The LBAS AGNs in which the LAT has detected significant gamma-ray flux
variability generally have faster jets than the nonvariable ones. These
findings are in overall agreement with earlier results based on nonuniform
EGRET data which suggested that gamma-ray bright AGNs have preferentially
higher Doppler boosting factors than other blazar jets. However, the relatively
low LAT detection rates for the full MOJAVE sample (24%) and previously known
MOJAVE EGRET-detected blazars (43%) imply that Doppler boosting is not the sole
factor that determines whether a particular AGN is bright at gamma-ray
energies. The slower apparent jet speeds of LBAS BL Lac objects and their
higher overall LAT detection rate as compared to quasars suggest that the
former are being detected by Fermi because of their higher intrinsic (unbeamed)
gamma-ray to radio luminosity ratios.

entangled states. Quantifying the amount of entanglement that was actually
generated can, in principle, be accomplished using full-state tomography. This
method requires the determination of a parameter set that is growing
exponentially with the number of qubits and becomes infeasible even for
moderate numbers of particles. Non-trivial bounds on experimentally prepared
entanglement can however be obtained from partial information on the density
matrix. The fundamental question that needs to be addressed in this context is
then formulated as: What is the entanglement content of the least entangled
quantum state that is compatible with the available measurement data?
  We formulate the problem mathematically employing methods from the theory of
semi-definite programming and then address this problem for the case, where the
goal of the experiment is the creation of graph states. The observables that we
consider are the generators of the stabilizer group, thus the number of
measurement settings grows only linearly in the number of qubits. We provide
analytical solutions as well as numerical methods that may be applied directly
to experiments, and compare the obtained bounds with results from full-state
tomography for simulated data.

the physics regulating the transformation of gas into stars was allowed to
change producing galaxies with different morphologies. Although the DM profiles
get more concentrated as baryons are collected at the centre of the haloes
compared to a pure dynamical run, the total baryonic mass alone is not enough
to fully predict the reaction of the DM profile. We also note that baryons
affect the DM distribution even outside the central regions. Those systems
where the transformation of gas into stars is regulated by Supernova (SN)
feedback, so that significant disc structures are able to form, are found to
have more concentrated dark matter profiles than a galaxy which has efficiently
transformed most of its baryons into stars at early times. The accretion of
satellites is found to be associated with an expansion of the dark matter
profiles, triggered by angular momentum transfer from the incoming satellites.
As the impact of SN feedback increases, the satellites get less massive and are
even strongly disrupted before getting close to the main structure causing less
angular momentum transfer. Our findings suggest that the response of the DM
halo is driven by the history of assembly of baryons into a galaxy along their
merger tree.

general mathematical scheme is proposed that attempts to achieve the same.
Instead of n-dimensional random vector description, protein surface roughness
is described here as a system of algebraic equations. Such description resulted
in the construction of a generalized index that not only describes the
shape-change-vs-surface-roughness-change process but also reduces the
estimation error in local shape characterization. Suitable algorithmic
implementation of it in context-specific macromolecular recognition can be
attempted easily. Contemporary drug discovery studies will be enormously

the change in protein surface roughness as the local shape of the protein is
changing (and vice-versa).

large displacement-gradients near a crack's tip, even at scales where no
irreversible deformation and energy dissipation occurs. This physical situation
provides the motivation for a systematic gradient expansion of general
nonlinear elastic constitutive laws that goes beyond the first order
displacement-gradient expansion that is the basis for linear elastic fracture
mechanics (LEFM). A weakly nonlinear fracture mechanics theory was recently
developed by considering displacement-gradients up to second order. The theory
predicts that, at scales within a dynamic lengthscale $\ell$ from a crack's
tip, significant $\log{r}$ displacements and $1/r$ displacement-gradient
contributions arise. Whereas in LEFM the $1/r$ singularity generates an
unbalanced force and must be discarded, we show that this singularity not only
exists but is {\em necessary} in the weakly nonlinear theory. The theory
generates no spurious forces and is consistent with the notion of the autonomy
of the near-tip nonlinear region. The J-integral in the weakly nonlinear theory
is also shown to be path-independent, taking the same value as the linear
elastic J-integral. Thus, the weakly nonlinear theory retains the key tenets of
fracture mechanics, while providing excellent quantitative agreement with
measurements near the tip of single propagating cracks. As $\ell$ is consistent
with lengthscales that appear in crack tip instabilities, we suggest that this
theory may serve as a promising starting point for resolving open questions in
fracture dynamics.

studying the abundances of key elements in bulge stars. The aim of this study
is to determine the chemical evolution of CNO, and a few other elements in
stars in the Galactic bulge, and to discuss the sensitivities of the derived
abundances from molecular lines. High-resolution, near-IR spectra in the H band
were recorded using VLT/CRIRES. Due to the high and variable visual extinction
in the line-of-sight towards the bulge, an analysis in the near-IR is
preferred. The CNO abundances can all be determined simultaneously from the
numerous molecular lines in the wavelength range observed. The three giant
stars in Baade's window presented here are the first bulge stars observed with
CRIRES. We have especially determined the CNO abundances, with uncertainties of
less than 0.20 dex, from CO, CN, and OH lines. Since the systematic
uncertainties in the derived CNO abundances due to uncertainties in the stellar
fundamental parameters, notably Teff, are significant, a detailed discussion of
the sensitivities of the derived abundances is included. We find good agreement
between near-IR and optically determined O, Ti, Fe, and Si abundances. Two of
our stars show a solar [C+N/Fe], suggesting that these giants have experienced
the first dredge-up and that the oxygen abundance should reflect the original
abundance of the giants. The two giants fit into the picture, in which there is
no significant difference between the O abundance in bulge and thick-disk
stars. Our determination of the S abundances is the first for bulge stars. The
high [S/Fe] values for all the stars indicate a high star-formation rate in an
early phase of the bulge evolution.

approximate abundances and absolute magnitudes for 368 stars over 1.3 square

from our previous photometric parallax investigations and with sufficient
accounting for the metallicity bias in the UVX method, we are able to compare
the vertical abundance distribution to those measured in previous studies. We
find that the abundance distribution has an underlying uniform component
consistent with previous spectroscopic results that posit a monometallic thick
disk and halo with abundances of $[Fe/H]$ = $-$0.8 and $-$1.4, respectively.
However, there are a number of outlying data points that may indicate
contamination by more metal-rich halo streams. The absence of vertical
abundance gradients in the Galactic stellar populations and the possible
presence of interloping halo streams would be consistent with expectations from
merger models of Galaxy formation. We find that our UVX method has limited
sensitivity in exploring the metallicity distribution of the distant Galactic
halo, owing to the poor constraint on the $UBV$ properties of very metal-poor
stars. The derivation of metallicities from broadband $UBV$ photometry remains
fundamentally sound for the exploration of the halo but is in need of both
improved calibration and superior data.

time of arrivals of the pulses observed during the XMM observation, we derived
the best-fit orbital solution and a best-fit value of the spin period for the
2008 outburst. Comparing this new set of orbital parameters and, in particular,
the value of the time of ascending-node passage with the orbital parameters
derived for the previous four X-ray outbursts of SAX J1808.4-3658 observed by
the PCA on board RXTE, we find an updated value of the orbital period
derivative, which turns out to be $\dot P_{\rm orb} = (3.89 \pm 0.15) \times
10^{-12}$ s/s. This new value of the orbital period derivative agrees with the
previously reported value, demonstrating that the orbital period derivative in
this source has remained stable over the past ten years. Although this timespan
is not sufficient yet for confirming the secular evolution of the system, we
again propose an explanation of this behavior in terms of a highly
non-conservative mass transfer in this system, where the accreted mass (as
derived from the X-ray luminosity during outbursts) accounts for a mere 1% of
the mass lost by the companion.

behaviour and novel states of matter. One remarkable example is predicted to
occur in a semiconductor quantum dot (QD) where at vanishing density the
Coulomb correlation among electrons rigidly fixes their relative position as
that of the nuclei in a molecule. In this limit, the neutral few-body
excitations are roto-vibrations, which have either rigid-rotor or
relative-motion character. In the weak-correlation regime, on the contrary, the
Coriolis force mixes rotational and vibrational motions. Here we report
evidence of roto-vibrational modes of an electron molecular state at densities
for which electron localization is not yet fully achieved. We probe these
collective modes by inelastic light scattering in QDs containing four
electrons. Spectra of low-lying excitations associated to changes of the
relative-motion wave function -the analogues of the vibration modes of a
conventional molecule- do not depend on the rotational state represented by the
total angular momentum. Theoretical simulations via the
configuration-interaction (CI) method are in agreement with the observed
roto-vibrational modes and indicate that such molecular excitations develop at
the onset of short-range correlation.

is the maximal number of accepting computations of N for an input of size n.
For all k, r 2 N we construct languages Lr,k which can be recognized by NFA's
with size k poly(r) and ambiguity O(nk), but Lr,k has only NFA's with
exponential size, if ambiguity o(nk) is required. In particular, a hierarchy
for polynomial ambiguity is obtained, solving a long standing open problem
(Ravikumar and Ibarra, 1989, Leung, 1998).

  Science - STACS 2009 (2009) 433-444",,,"cs.CC cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An infinite binary sequence has randomness rate at least $\sigma$ if, for
almost every $n$, the Kolmogorov complexity of its prefix of length $n$ is at
least $\sigma n$. It is known that for every rational $\sigma \in (0,1)$, on
one hand, there exists sequences with randomness rate $\sigma$ that can not be
effectively transformed into a sequence with randomness rate higher than
$\sigma$ and, on the other hand, any two independent sequences with randomness
rate $\sigma$ can be transformed into a sequence with randomness rate higher
than $\sigma$. We show that the latter result holds even if the two input
sequences have linear dependency (which, informally speaking, means that all
prefixes of length $n$ of the two sequences have in common a constant fraction
of their information). The similar problem is studied for finite strings. It is
shown that from any two strings with sufficiently large Kolmogorov complexity
and sufficiently small dependence, one can effectively construct a string that
is random even conditioned by any one of the input strings.

fiber link comprising 22 km of optical communications network fiber

digital data signal are transferred on two different frequency channels in a
dense wavelength division multiplexing scheme. The metrological signal is
inserted into and extracted from the communications network by using
bidirectional off-the-shelf optical add-drop multiplexers. The link-induced
phase noise is measured and cancelled with round-trip technique using an
all-fiber-based interferometer. The compensated link shows an Allan deviation
of a few 10-16 at one second and below 10-19 at 10,000 seconds. This opens the
way to a wide dissemination of ultra stable optical clock signals between
distant laboratories via the Internet network.
