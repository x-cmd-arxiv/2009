Ib supernova 2007Y. Imaging was obtained from X-ray to radio wavelengths, and a
comprehensive set of multi-band (w2m2w1u'g'r'i'UBVYJHKs) light curves and
optical spectroscopy is presented. A virtually complete bolometric light curve
is derived, from which we infer a (56)Ni-mass of 0.06 M_sun. The early spectrum
strongly resembles SN 2005bf and exhibits high-velocity features of CaII and
H_alpha; during late epochs the spectrum shows evidence of a ejecta-wind
interaction. Nebular emission lines have similar widths and exhibit profiles
that indicate a lack of major asymmetry in the ejecta. Late phase spectra are
modeled with a non-LTE code, from which we find (56)Ni, O and total-ejecta
masses (excluding He) to be 0.06, 0.2 and 0.42 M_sun, respectively, below 4,500
km/s. The (56)Ni mass confirms results obtained from the bolometric light
curve. The oxygen abundance suggests the progenitor was most likely a ~3.3
M_sun He core star that evolved from a zero-age-main-sequence mass of 10-13
M_sun. The explosion energy is determined to be ~10^50 erg, and the mass-loss
rate of the progenitor is constrained from X-ray and radio observations to be
<~10^-6 M_sun/yr. SN 2007Y is among the least energetic normal Type Ib
supernovae ever studied.

fluctuations from inflation. The non-equilibrium excitation of interacting
scalar fields often evolves into infra-red (IR) and ultra-violet (UV)
cascading, resulting in an intermediate scaling regime. We observe elements of
this phenomenon in a simple model with inflaton \phi and iso-inflaton \chi
fields interacting during inflation via the coupling g^2 (\phi-\phi_0)^2
\chi^2. Iso-inflaton particles are created during inflation when they become
instantaneously massless at \phi=\phi_0, with occupation numbers not exceeding
unity. We point out that very quickly the produced \chi particles become heavy
and their multiple re-scatterings off the homogeneous condensate \phi(t)
generates bremschtrahlung radiation of light inflaton IR fluctuations with high
occupation numbers. The subsequent evolution of these IR fluctuations is
qualitatively similar to that of the usual inflationary fluctuations, but their
initial amplitude is different. The IR cascading generates a bump-shaped
contribution to the cosmological curvature fluctuations, which can even
dominate over the usual fluctuations for g^2>0.06. The IR cascading curvature
fluctuations are significantly non-gaussian and the strength and location of
the bump are model-dependent, through g^2 and \phi_0. The effect from IR
cascading fluctuations is significantly larger than that from the momentary
slowing-down of \phi(t). With a sequence of such bursts of particle production,
the superposition of the bumps can lead to a new broad band non-gaussian
component of cosmological fluctuations added to the usual fluctuations. Such a
sequence of particle creation events can, but need not, lead to trapped
inflation.

mechanism to recover General Relativity (GR) on small scales in order to avoid
the stringent constrains on deviations from GR at solar system scales. Based on
our formalism, the quasi non-linear power spectrum in the
Dvali-Gabadadze-Porratti (DGP) braneworld models and $f(R)$ gravity models are
derived by taking into account the mechanism to recover GR properly. We also
extrapolate our predictions to fully non-linear scales using the Parametrized
Post Friedmann (PPF) framework. In $f(R)$ gravity models, the predicted
non-linear power spectrum is shown to reproduce N-body results. We find that
the mechanism to recover GR suppresses the difference between the modified
gravity models and dark energy models with the same expansion history, but the
difference remains large at weakly non-linear regime in these models. Our
formalism is applicable to a wide variety of modified gravity models and it is
ready to use once consistent models for modified gravity are developed.

little effort has been invested in quantifying the caveats one necessarily
encounters when one extracts trees directly from such a simulation. To somewhat
revert the tide, this paper seeks to provide its reader with a comprehensive
study of the problems one faces when following this route. The first step to
building merger histories of dark matter haloes and their subhaloes is to
identify these structures in each of the time outputs (snapshots) produced by
the simulation. Even though we discuss a particular implementation of such an
algorithm (called AdaptaHOP) in this paper, we believe that our results do not
depend on the exact details of the implementation but extend to most if not all
(sub)structure finders. We then highlight different ways to build merger
histories from AdaptaHOP haloes and subhaloes, contrasting their various
advantages and drawbacks. We find that the best approach to (sub)halo merging
histories is through an analysis that goes back and forth between
identification and tree building rather than one which conducts a
straightforward sequential treatment of these two steps. This is rooted in the
complexity of the merging trees which have to depict an inherently dynamical
process from the partial temporal information contained in the collection of
instantaneous snapshots available from the N-body simulation.

via the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. Here, we show how to combine measurements
of lambda in different systems to derive statistical constraints on psi. We
apply the method to 11 published measurements of lambda, using two different
single-parameter distributions to describe the ensemble. First, assuming a
Rayleigh distribution (or more precisely, a Fisher distribution on a sphere),
we find that the peak value is less than 22 degrees with 95% confidence.
Second, assuming a fraction f of the orbits have random orientations relative
to the stars, and the remaining fraction (1-f) are perfectly aligned, we find
f<0.36 with 95% confidence. This latter model fits the data better than the
Rayleigh distribution, mainly because the XO-3 system was found to be strongly
misaligned while the other 10 systems are consistent with perfect alignment. If
the XO-3 result proves robust, then our results may be interpreted as evidence
for two distinct modes of planet migration.

establish coherence with respect Rel and Gen. It also sheds light on the

completeness of the syntactical presentations is proved via normal forms, with
the normal form for SplPre and Gen being in some sense orthogonal to the

present limits on the pseudoscalar particle mass and the pseudoscalar-photon

a small number of powerful magnets (B = 10 T), due to the large incident photon

infrared or optical lasers allows a significant improvement in the mass reach
of the experiment (it is possible to test masses up to 0.01 eV without a drop
in sensitivity). Large, but still feasible, configurations can explore in a
quite model-independent way a large part of the parameter space examined by
solar searches and HB stars in globular clusters. Additionally, the proposal

throughput analysis. Typically, the ordering of markers is based on a
stabilized variant of the t-score, such as the moderated t or the SAM
statistic. However, these procedures ignore gene-gene correlations, which may
have a profound impact on the gene orderings and on the power of the subsequent
tests.
  We propose a simple procedure that adjusts gene-wise t-statistics to take
account of correlations among genes. The resulting correlation-adjusted
t-scores (""cat"" scores) are derived from a predictive perspective, i.e. as a
score for variable selection to discriminate group membership in two-class
linear discriminant analysis. In the absence of correlation the cat score
reduces to the standard t-score. Moreover, using the cat score it is
straightforward to evaluate groups of features (i.e. gene sets). For
computation of the cat score from small sample data we propose a shrinkage
procedure. In a comparative study comprising six different synthetic and
empirical correlation structures we show that the cat score improves estimation
of gene orderings and leads to higher power for fixed true discovery rate, and
vice versa. Finally, we also illustrate the cat score by analyzing metabolomic
data.

order to construct, for the first time, the sub-solar initial mass function
(IMF) in the LMC. We use the deepest photometry ever performed in the LMC with
the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on-board the Hubble Space Telescope(HST).
We carry out a Monte Carlo technique to subtract the contribution of the
general field of LMC and we isolate the central region in the observed area of
the association. We study the mass function of its field-subtracted population.
For this purpose, we introduce a new set of evolutionary models, derived from
the calculations on the evolution of PMS stars by Siess et al. We use these
models with our observations of LH 95 to derive the IMF of the system, which is
reliably constructed down to 0.43 M_sun, the lowest mass ever observed within
reasonable completeness in the Magellanic Clouds. Consequently, its
construction offers an outstanding improvement in our understanding of the
low-mass star formation in the LMC. The system IMF of LH 95 shows a definite
change in its slope at 1 M_sun, where it becomes more shallow. In general, the
shape of this IMF agrees very well with the average Galactic IMF, down to the
sub-solar regime. As far as the slope of this system IMF is concerned, it is
found to be somewhat more shallow than the corresponding classical Galactic IMF
in the sub-solar regime, probably due to unresolved binarity, while for stars
with M>1M_sun it becomes slightly steeper. We do not find significant
differences in the shape of the overall IMF of LH 95 from that of each of the
three individual sub-clusters, suggesting that the IMF of LH 95 is not subject
to local variability.

we report on the discovery of the afterglow and subsequent redshift

Observations were done with 7-channel imager GROND at the 2.2m MPI/ESO
telescope, the SIRIUS instrument at the Nagoya-SAAO 1.4m telescope in South
Africa, and the GMOS instrument at Gemini-S. The afterglow photometric redshift
of z=4.35+-0.15, based on simultaneous 7-filter observations with the Gamma-Ray
Optical and Near-infrared Detector (GROND), places GRB 080916C among the top 5%
most distant GRBs, and makes it the most energetic GRB known to date. The
detection of GeV photons from such a distant event is rather surprising.
  The observed gamma-ray variability in the prompt emission together with the
redshift suggests a lower limit for the Lorentz factor of the
ultra-relativistic ejecta of Gamma > 1090. This value rivals any previous
measurements of Gamma in GRBs and strengthens the extreme nature of GRB

a suitable performance criterion able to generate proper dynamic behaviors. Two
quite different criteria are likely to be appropriate candidates: the minimum
effort cost (or sthenic criterion) and the minimum energy cost. The paper is
aimed at clarifying the dynamic effects of these two fundamental criteria when
considering movements executed with liveliness as they are in gymnastic. It is
well known that the former cost generates movements with smooth dynamics. A
special attention is devoted to the latter. The optimal control theory shows
that minimizing the energy consumption results in actuating inputs of
bang-off-bang type producing momentum impulses. When achieving dynamic
synthesis, this criterion makes necessary to account for bounds set on driving
torques. Moreover, when dealing with one-sided contacts, as in floor
handstands, the unilaterality of contact forces must be explicitly accounted
for since it tends to be infringed by impulsive efforts. Numerical simulations
of these formal properties are carried out using a parametric optimization
technique, and considering the raising phase of floor handstands. It is shown
that the energetic criterion tends to generate movements which exhibit
similarities with their real counterpart performed by an expert gymnast.
Conversely, the sthenic criterion produces movements quite different. But, a
salient fact is that these ones proved to be easier to perform by young
beginners. As a result, they could help to coach novice gymnasts.

very open question. Here we will argue that axinos can be successful dark
matter candidates in models with supersymmetry and the axion solution of the
strong CP problem. Axinos can be the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), or
can be heavier than the LSP. Axinos can be produced in the right abundance by
thermal scatterings and if they are the LSP also by out of equilibrium decays
of the lightest superpartner of SM fields (LSPSMs). On the other hand heavier
(not LSP) axinos can generate a part of the neutralino LSP dark matter.
Depending on the nature of the supersymmetric spectrum, and if R-parity is
strictly conserved or slightly broken, very different signals of the LSP axino
scenario can arise at colliders and in astrophysics.

Therefore the predicted spectral energy distribution (SED) will depend on where

electrons, and consequently the inverse Compton flux almost always dominates
the bolometric output. This is more so for large black hole masses. Dissipation
taking place beyond the broad line region is particularly interesting, since it
accounts in a simple way for the largest inverse Compton to synchrotron flux
ratios accompanied by an extremely hard X-ray spectrum. Furthermore it makes
the high power blazars at high redshift useful tools to study the optical to UV

N-body simulations with and without a gaseous component. In the second case
star formation/feedback recipes have also been implemented to create new
stellar populations. As in many previous studies, in our N-body collisionless
simulation, the B/PS is due to the classical break in the z mirror symmetry
lasting roughly 200 Myr. When a gaseous component and star formation recipes
are added to the simulation, the bulge-growing mechanism is quite different.
The young stellar population that is born in the thin gaseous disc rapidly
populates vertical resonant orbits triggered by the combined effects of the
linear horizontal and vertical ILRs. This leads to a B/PS bulge mainly made of
stellar material younger than the surrounding population. The non-linear
analysis of the orbital structure shows that the main orbit family responsible
for the B/PS is not the same in the two cases. The 2:2:1 orbits prevail in the
collisionless simulation whereas additional asymmetrical families contribute to
the B/PS if a dissipative component is present and can form new stars. We found
that 2:3:1 and 2:5:1 orbits trap a significant fraction of the mass. A flat
ringed discy stellar component also appears simultaneously with the thickening
of the young population. It is due to the star formation in a nuclear gaseous
disc located in the central kpc, inside the ILR, and accumulated there by the
torques exerted by the large-scale bar. Remarkably, it remains flat throughout
the simulation although it develops a nuclear bar, leading to a double-barred
galaxy. We predict that two populations of B/PS bulges could exist and even
coexist in the same galaxy.

discrete and luminous star-forming regions are detected in the south of the
galaxy that appear to be associated with massive star clusters previously
identified at optical wavelengths. However, the remaining optically-identified
massive star clusters are not clearly associated with radio emission (either
thermal or non-thermal) down to the sensitivity limits of these radio data. The
spectral energy distributions of the two radio-detected clusters are consistent
with being purely thermal, and the entire region has an inferred ionizing flux
of ~1.2 x 10^ 53 s^-1, which is equivalent to ~12,000 ""typical"" O-type stars
(type O7.5 V). The observations presented here have resolved out a significant
contribution from diffuse non-thermal emission detected previously, implying a
previous episode of significant star formation. The current star formation rate
(SFR) for this southern region alone is ~1.3 M_sun yr^-1, or ~ 23M_sun yr^-1
kpc^-2. This SFR derived from thermal radio emission also suggests that
previous optical recombination line studies are not detecting a significant
fraction of the current star formation in SBS 0335-052. From model fits to the
radio spectral energy distribution, we infer a global mean density in the two
youngest clusters of n_e > 10^3-10^4 cm^-3. In addition, a comparison between
the compact and diffuse radio emission indicates that up to ~50% of the
ionizing flux could be leaking out of the compact HII regions.

tends to decrease the magnetic transition temperature in the undoped or only

including the amount of linear polarization, the amount and sign of Faraday
rotation, and the amount and sign of circular polarization can be explained by
a consistent physical picture. The base of the jet is modeled as an
inhomogeneous Blandford-Konigl style conical jet dominated by a vector-ordered
poloidal magnetic field along the jet axis, and we estimate its net magnetic
flux. This poloidal field is responsible for the linear and circular
polarization from this inhomogeneous component. Farther down the jet the
magnetic field in two homogeneous features is dominated by local shocks and a
smaller fraction of vector-ordered poloidal field remains along the jet axis.
In this picture, we find the jet to be kinetically dominated by protons with
the radiating particles being dominated by electrons at an approximate fraction
of >~ 75%. Based on the amounts of Faraday conversion deduced for the
homogeneous components, we find a plausible range for the lower cutoff in the
relativistic particle energy spectrum to be 5 <~ gamma_l <~ 35. The physical
picture described here is not unique if the observed Faraday rotation and
depolarization occur in screens external to the jet; however, we find the joint
explanation of linear and circular polarization observations from a single set
of magnetic fields and particle properties internal to the jet to be compelling
evidence for this picture. (Abridged)

reported in coherent quantum Hall devices. Such sub-period is not expected for
non-interacting electrons and thus is thought to result from interelectron
Coulomb interaction. Here we report experiments in a Fabry-Perot interferometer
comprised of two wide constrictions enclosing an electron island. By carefully
tuning the constriction front gates, we find a regime where interference
oscillations with period h/2e persist throughout the transition between the
integer quantum Hall plateaus 2 and 3, including half-filling. In a large
quantum Hall sample, a transition between integer plateaus occurs near
half-filling, where the bulk of the sample becomes delocalized and thus
dissipative bulk current flows between the counterpropagating edges
(""backscattering""). In a quantum Hall constriction, where conductance is due to
electron tunneling, a transition between forward- and back-scattering is
expected near the half-filling. In our experiment, neither period nor amplitude
of the oscillations show a discontinuity at half-filling, indicating that only
one interference path exists throughout the transition. We also present
experiments and an analysis of the front-gate dependence of the phase of the
oscillations. The results point to a single physical mechanism of the observed
conductance oscillations: Aharonov-Bohm interference of interacting electrons
in quantum Hall regime.

processes that tend to segregate it into distinct phases due to thermal
instability (TI), and on the other, to turbulence-driving mechanisms that tend
to produce strong nonlinear fluctuations in all the thermodynamic variables. In
this regime, large-scale turbulent compressions in the stable warm neutral
medium (WNM) dominate the clump-formation process rather than the linear
developent of TI. Cold clumps formed by this mechanism are often bounded by
sharp density and temperature discontinuities, which however are not contact
discontinuities as in the classical 2-phase model, but rather ""phase transition
fronts"", across which there is net mass and momentum flux from the WNM into the
clumps. The clumps grow mainly by accretion through their boundaries, are in
both thermal and ram pressure balance with their surroundings, and are
internally turbulent as well, thus also having significant density fluctuations
inside. The temperature and density of the cold and warm gas around the phase
transition fronts fluctuate with time and location due to fluctuations in the
turbulent pressure. Moreover, shock-compressed diffuse unstable gas can remain
in the unstable regime for up to a few Myr before it undergoes a phase
transition to the cold phase. These processes populate the classically
forbidden density and temperature ranges. Since gas at all temperatures appears
to be present in bi- or tri-stable turbulence, we conclude that the word
""phase"" applies only locally, surrounding phase transition sites in the gas.
Globally, the word ""phase"" must relax its meaning to simply denote a certain
temperature or density range.

both within and between the layers, in contrast to the quasiparticles in a
multilayer Laughlin state which are confined within each layer. Moreover, the
state has gapless neutral collective modes, a manifestation of an emergent

integrable lattice model away from half-filling. The divergent power-law
singularity of the spectral function near the single-particle or single-hole
energy is described by an effective x-ray edge type model. At low densities and
for momentum near the zone boundary, we find a second divergent singularity at
higher energies which is associated with a two-particle bound state. We use the
Bethe ansatz solution of the model to calculate the exact singularity exponents
for any momentum and for arbitrary values of chemical potential and interaction
strength in the critical regime. We relate the singularities of the spectral
function to the long-time decay of the fermion Green's function and compare our
predictions with numerical results from the time-dependent density matrix
renormalization group (tDMRG). Our results show that the tDMRG method is able
to provide accurate time decay exponents in the cases of power-law decay of the
Green's function. Some implications for the line shape of the dynamical
structure factor away from half-filling are also discussed. In addition, the
spectral weight of the Luttinger liquid result for the dynamical structure
factor of the Heisenberg model at zero field is compared with the exact
two-spinon contribution.

the ergodic sum capacity of a $K$ user phase-fading interference network, i.e.,
an interference network where the fading process is restricted primarily to
independent and uniform phase variations while the channel magnitudes are held
fixed across time. It is shown that even though there are $K(K-1)$ cross-links,
only about $K/2$ disjoint and equal strength interference links suffice to
determine the capacity of the network regardless of the strengths of the rest
of the cross channels. This scenario is called a \emph{minimal bottleneck
state}. It is shown that ergodic interference alignment is capacity optimal for
a network in a minimal bottleneck state. The results are applied to large
networks. It is shown that large networks are close to bottleneck states with a
high probability, so that ergodic interference alignment is close to optimal
for large networks. Limitations of the notion of bottleneck states are also
highlighted for channels where both the phase and the magnitudes vary with
time. It is shown through an example that for these channels, joint coding
across different bottleneck states makes it possible to circumvent the capacity
bottlenecks.

system of four electrons in lateral double quantum dots are investigated using
exact diagonalization (EXD), as a function of interdot separation, applied
magnetic field, and strength of interelectron repulsion. A distinctly different
quantum behavior is found compared to that of circular single quantum dots. As
a function of the magnetic field, the energy spectra exhibit a low-energy band
consisting of a group of six states, with the number six being a consequence of
the conservation of the total spin of the four electrons and the ensuing spin
degeneracies. These six states appear to cross at a single value of the
magnetic field, with the crossing point becoming sharper for larger interdot
distances. As the strength of the Coulomb repulsion increases, the six states
tend to become degenerate and a well defined energy gap separates them from the
higher-in-energy excited states.
  The appearance of the low-energy band is a consequence of the formation of a
Wigner supermolecule, with the four electrons (two in each dot) being localized
at the vertices of a rectangular parallelogram. Using the spin-resolved
pair-correlation functions, one can map the EXD many-body wave functions onto
the spin functions associated with the four localized electrons. Analogies with
nanomagnets, such as finite Heisenberg clusters, are discussed. The ability to
determine associated spin functions enables investigations concerning
entanglement properties of the system of four electrons. In particular, the
formation of Wigner supermolecules generates EXD solutions belonging to the
class of strongly entangled states referred to as N-qubit Dicke states in the
quantum-information literature.

We constrain parameters related to star formation with the help of

the observed metallicity of the inter-galactic medium at z ~ 5 and the
requirement that the Thomson scattering optical depth due to an ionized IGM as
determined for the model from CMB observations be reproduced. We consider a
range of initial metalicities for star forming gas, and some variations of the
initial mass function of stars. We find that a ""normal"" initial mass function
(IMF) may satisfy these two constraints with a raised efficiency of star
formation as compared to that seen in the local universe. Observations require
a significant fraction of metals to escape from haloes to the IGM. We can also
place constraints on the ratio of escape fraction for metals and ionizing
photons, we find that this ratio is of order unity for most models. This
highlights the importance of using the constraints arising from enrichment of

theory in combination with a thermodynamic formalism. The exchange of oxygen,
hydrogen, and water molecules with the gas phase is considered. Particular
attention is given to the convergence of all calculations with respect to
lateral system size and slab thickness. In addition, the reliability of
semilocal density functionals to describing the energetics of the reduced
surfaces is critically evaluated. For ambient conditions the surface is found
to be fully covered by molecularly adsorbed water. At low coverages, in the
limit of single, isolated water molecules, molecular and dissociative
adsorption become energetically degenerate. Oxygen vacancies form in strongly
reducing, oxygen-poor environments. However, already at slightly more moderate
conditions it is shown that removing full TiO_2 units from the surface is
thermodynamically preferred. In agreement with recent experimental observations
it is furthermore confirmed that even under extremely hydrogen-rich
environments the surface cannot be fully hydroxylated, but only a maximum
coverage with hydrogen of about 0.6-0.7 monolayer can be reached. Finally,
calculations of migration paths strongly suggest that hydrogen prefers to
diffuse into the bulk over desorbing from the surface into the gas phase.

different types of wall roughness are reported. The nature (Fickian or not) of
dispersion is determined by studying variations of the mixing front as a
function of the traveled distance but also as a function of the lateral scale
over which the tracer concentration is averaged. The dominant convective
dispersion mechanisms (velocity profile in the gap, velocity variations in the
fracture plane) are established by comparing measurements using Newtonian and
shear thinning fluids. For small monodisperse rugosities, front spreading is
diffusive with a dominant geometrical dispersion (dispersion coefficient $D
\propto Pe$) at low P\'eclet numbers $Pe$; at higher $Pe$ values one has either
$D \propto Pe^2$ ({\it i.e.} Taylor dispersion) for obstacles of height smaller
than the gap or $D \propto Pe^{1.35}$ for obstacles bridging the gap. For a
self affine multiscale roughness like in actual rocks and a relative shear
displacement $\vec{\delta}$ of complementary walls, the aperture field is
channelized in the direction perpendicular to $\delta$. For a mean velocity
$\vec{U}$ parallel to the channels, the global front geometry reflects the
velocity contrast between them and is predicted from the aperture field. For
$\vec{U}$ perpendicular to the channels, global front spreading is much
reduced. Local spreading of the front thickness remains mostly controlled by
Taylor dispersion except in the case of a very strong channelization parallel
to $\vec U$.

agreement with the prediction by the scaling theory and the

detailed spectral analysis of 194 LSBGs from the Impey et al. (1996) APM LSBG

carry out, for the first time, reliable spectral classification of nuclear

a rigorous way. Star-forming galaxies are common, as found in about 52% LSBGs.
We find, contrary to some of the previous claims, that the fraction of galaxies
containing an AGN is significantly lower than that found in nearby normal
galaxies of high surface brightness. This is qualitatively in line with the
finding of Impey et al. (2001). This result holds true even within each
morphological type from Sa to Sc. LSBGs having larger central stellar velocity
dispersions, or larger physical sizes, tend to have a higher chance to harbor
an AGN. For three AGNs with broad emission lines, the black hole masses
estimated from the emission lines are broadly consistent with the well known
M-$\sigma_\ast$ relation established for normal galaxies and AGNs.

the absorption profile are two components, separated by ~1100 km/s. The HI
absorption in 4C37.11 is unusual because it is the first case where such broad
absorption is found to be centred on the systemic velocity of the host galaxy
and not asymmetric and blueshifted as is seen in all other galaxies with broad
HI absorption. Given the large width of the absorption, we suggest that a
possible explanation for the extreme properties of the HI absorption is that it
is the kinematic signature of a binary black hole. If this interpretation is
correct, the combined black hole mass derived from the absorption profile is
consistent with that derived from the luminosity of the spheroid. If the broad
absorption is indeed due to a binary black hole, this finding confirms the
importance of the gaseous component in the merging process of supermassive
black holes.

  $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb{P}^2(\mathbb{C})).$ We classify, up to automorphisms of
$\mathbb{P}^2(\mathbb{C}),$ quadratic foliations with only one singularity.
There are only four such foliations up to conjugacy; whereas three of them have
a dynamic which can be easily described the dynamic of the fourth is still
mysterious. This classification also allows us to describe the action of
$\mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb{P}^2(\mathbb{C}))$ on $\mathscr{F}(2;2).$ On the one hand

exactly two orbits of dimension $6;$ on the other hand we obtain that the

orbits of dimension~7 and exactly one orbit of dimension $6.$

the effective field theory already presented in [Phys. Rev. E 78, 031102]

and Palmer) equations in which each community plays the role of a microscopic
spin. The relative susceptibilities derived from these equations calculated at
finite or zero temperature, where the method provides an effective percolation
theory, give us the answers to the above issues. Unlike the case n=1,
asymmetries among the communities may lead, via the TAP-like structure of the
equations, to many metastable states whose number, in the case of negative
short-cuts among the communities, may grow exponentially fast with n. As
examples we consider the n Viana-Bray communities model and the n
one-dimensional small-world communities model. Despite being the simplest ones,
the relevance of these models in network theory, as e.g. in social networks, is
crucial and no analytic solution were known until now. Connections between
percolation and the fractal dimension of a network are also discussed. Finally,
as an inverse problem, we show how, from the relative susceptibilities, a
natural and efficient method to detect the community structure of a generic

analyzed for statistically homogeneous isotropic flows. Phenomenologically,
spatial homogeneity of particles configurations is broken by the advection of a
range of eddies determined by the Stokes relaxation time of the particles which
results in a multi-scale distribution of local concentrations and voids. Much
less is known concerning anisotropic flows. Here, by addressing direct
numerical simulations (DNS) of a statistically steady particle-laden
homogeneous shear flow, we provide evidence that the mean shear preferentially
orients particle patterns. By imprinting anisotropy on large scales velocity
fluctuations, the shear indirectly affects the geometry of the clusters.
Quantitative evaluation is provided by a purposely designed tool, the angular
distribution function of particle pairs (ADF), which allows to address the
anisotropy content of particles aggregates on a scale by scale basis. The data
provide evidence that, depending on the Stokes relaxation time of the
particles, anisotropic clustering may occur even in the range of scales where
the carrier phase velocity field is already recovering isotropy. The strength
of the singularity in the anisotropic component of the ADF quantifies the level
of fine scale anisotropy, which may even reach values of more than 30%
direction-dependent variation in the probability to find two close-by particles
at viscous scale separation.

Transitoires) are two robotic observatories designed to observe the prompt
optical emission counterpart and the early afterglow of gamma ray bursts
(GRBs). We present data acquired between 2001 and 2008 and discuss the
properties of the optical emission of GRBs, noting various interesting results.
The optical emission observed during the prompt GRB phase is rarely very
bright: we estimate that 5% to 20% of GRBs exhibit a bright optical flash
(R<14) during the prompt gamma-ray emission, and that more than 50% of the GRBs
have an optical emission fainter than R=15.5 when the gamma-ray emission is
active. We study the apparent optical brightness distribution of GRBs at 1000 s
showing that our observations confirm the distribution derived by other groups.
The combination of these results with those obtained by other rapid slewing
telescopes allows us to better characterize the early optical emission of GRBs
and to emphasize the importance of very early multi-wavelength GRB studies for
the understanding of the physics of the ejecta.

Sheremet, Tishkovsky, Wolter and Zakharyaschev to capture a form of qualitative
similarity comparison. In this logic we can formulate assertions of the form ""
objects A are more similar to B than to C"". The semantics of this logic is
defined by structures equipped by distance functions evaluating the similarity
degree of objects. We consider here the particular case of the semantics
induced by \emph{minspaces}, the latter being distance spaces where the minimum
of a set of distances always exists. It turns out that the semantics over
arbitrary minspaces can be equivalently specified in terms of preferential
structures, typical of conditional logics. We first give a direct
axiomatisation of this logic over Minspaces. We next define a decision
procedure in the form of a tableaux calculus. Both the calculus and the
axiomatisation take advantage of the reformulation of the semantics in terms of
preferential structures.

bubble -- to understand the mechanisms triggering star formation around an HII
region and to establish what kind of stars are formed there. We present 870
microns observations of RCW 120, obtained with the APEX-LABOCA camera. These
show the distribution of cold dust, and thus of neutral material. We use
Spitzer-MIPS observations at 24 and 70 microns to detect the young stellar
objects (YSOs) present in this region and to estimate their evolutionary
stages.
  A layer of dense neutral material surrounds the HII region, having been swept
up during the region's expansion. This layer has a mass greater than 2000 solar
masses and is fragmented, with massive fragments elongated along the ionization
front (IF). We measured the 24 microns flux of 138 sources. Of these, 39 are
Class I or flat-spectrum YSOs observed in the direction of the collected layer.
We show that several triggering mechanisms are acting simultaneously in the
swept-up shell, where they form a second generation of stars. No massive YSOs
are detected. However, a massive, compact 870 microns core lies adjacent to the
IF. A 70 microns source with no 24 microns counterpart is detected at the same
position. This source is a likely candidate for a Class 0 YSO. Also at 24
microns, we detect a chain of about ten regularly spaced Class I or flat
spectrum sources, parallel to the IF, in the direction of the most massive
fragment. We suggest that the formation of these YSOs is the result of Jeans
gravitational instabilities in the collected layer. Finally, the 870 microns
emission, the 24 microns emission, and the Halpha emission show the existence
of an extended and partially ionized photodissociation region around RCW 120.

with finitely many cone types. We expand the existing theory of directed covers
of finite graphs to those of infinite graphs. While the lower growth rate still
equals the branching number, upper and lower growth rates do not longer
coincide in general. Furthermore, the behaviour of random walks on directed
covers of infinite graphs is more subtle. We provide a classification in terms
of recurrence and transience and point out that the critical random walk may be
recurrent or transient. Our proof is based on the observation that recurrence
of the random walk is equivalent to the almost sure extinction of an
appropriate branching process. Two examples in random environment are provided:
homesick random walk on infinite percolation clusters and random walk in random
environment on directed covers. Furthermore, we calculate, under reasonable
assumptions, the rate of escape with respect to suitable length functions and
prove the existence of the asymptotic entropy providing an explicit formula
which is also a new result for directed covers of finite graphs. In particular,
the asymptotic entropy of random walks on directed covers of finite graphs is
positive if and only if the random walk is transient.

between distant parties which are independent of the environment. This notion
is more general than the standard idea of a secret key -- it is a fully quantum
and more general form of privacy. The states which possess mutual independence
also generalize the so called private states -- those that possess private key.
We then show that the problem of distributed compression of quantum information
at distant sources can be solved in terms of mutual independence, if free
entanglement between the senders and the receiver is available. Namely, we
obtain a formula for the sum of rates of qubits needed to transmit a
distributed state between Alice and Bob to a decoder Charlie. We also show that
mutual independence is bounded from above by the relative entropy modulo a
conjecture, saying that if after removal of a single qubit the state becomes
product, its initial entanglement is bounded by 1. We suspect that mutual
independence is a highly singular quantity, i.e. that it is positive only on a
set of measure zero; furthermore, we believe that its presence is seen on the
single copy level. This appears to be born out in the classical case.

lightcurves power spectra. Autocorrelation techniques are then employed to
estimate the flickering flares timescales. A cross correlation study between
the line and its underlying continuum variability is presented. The cross
correlation between the photometric and spectroscopic data is also discussed.
The periodograms, calculated using emission line data, show a behavior that is
similar to those obtained from photometric datasets found in the literature,
with a plateau at lower frequencies and a power law at higher frequencies. The
power law index is consistent with stochastic events. The cross-correlation
study indicates the presence of a correlation between the variability on
H-alpha and its underlying continuum. Flickering timescales derived from the

validity of an artifact; (ii) the acceptability condition, which, when it
verifies in a discussion captured in the proposed language, signals that the
relative validity holds for the discussed artifact and for the participants in

  janvier 2009",,,"AAUA-2009","physics.class-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This study deals with spectral analysis of fluid-loaded vibrating structure.
It was recently observed in a numerical study on a high order perturbation
method under heavy fluid loading that a loaded vibrating plate results, not
only in the classical frequency shift of the in vacuo single resonance (in both
the real part because of the fluid added mass and the imaginary part because of
energy lost by radiation into the fluid), but also in an increase in the number
of the resonance frequencies : as a result of the loading, a single in vacuo
resonance frequency of the structure is transformed into a multiple resonance
frequency. Here we show that this phenomenon is said to be a refinement of the
Sanchez's classical result in their book (Vibration and coupling of continuous
systems, Springer-Verlag -1989-, paragraph 9.3) where it was established, using
asymptotic analysis, that in the case of a light loading conditions ""the
scattering frequencies of a fluid loaded elastic structure (ie the resonance
frequencies) are nearly the real eigenfrequencies of the elastic body alone and
the complex scattering frequencies of the fluid with a rigid solid"". A
theoretical explanation of the observed phenomenon of multiple resonance is
given using classical results of the distribution of zeros of entire functions.
It is established that every single in vacuo resonance frequency of a
rectangular plate is transformed into an infinite number of resonances when the
fluid-loading is accounted for.

communication networks, as for example the congestion control issue in IP
(Internet Protocol) routers. In this paper, we propose to design a linear
observer for time-delay systems to address the traffic monitoring issue in
TCP/AQM (Transmission Control Protocol/Active Queue Management) networks. Due
to several propagation delays and the queueing delay, the set TCP/AQM is
modeled as a multiple delayed system of a particular form. Hence, appropriate
robust control tools as quadratic separation are adopted to construct a delay
dependent observer for TCP flows estimation. Note that, the developed mechanism
enables also the anomaly detection issue for a class of DoS (Denial of Service)
attacks. At last, simulations via the network simulator NS-2 and an emulation
experiment validate the proposed methodology.

expectation value of some generic observable at a given time will yield very
similar expectation values of the same observable at any later time. This is
meant to apply to Schroedinger type dynamics in high dimensional Hilbert
spaces. As a consequence individual dynamics of expectation values are then
typically well described by the ensemble average. Our approach is based on the
Hilbert space average method. We support the analytical investigations with
numerics obtained by exact diagonalization of the full time-dependent
Schroedinger equation for some pertinent, abstract Hamiltonian model.
Furthermore, we discuss the implications on the applicability of projection
operator methods with respect to initial states, as well as on irreversibility
in general.

temperature between 4.2 K and 180 K (i. e. below the N\'{e}el temperature) when
taken as the derivative of the magnetization at high fields ($30\times10^4$
Oe). This behavior contrasts with the decrease in temperature previously found,
where the susceptibility was determined at lower fields ($5\times10^4$ Oe). At
high fields (up to $50 \times10^4$ Oe) the temperature dependence of the
antiferromagnetic susceptibility in ferritin nanoparticles approaches the
normal behavior of bulk antiferromagnets and nanoparticles considering
superantiferromagnetism, this latter leading to a better agreement at high
field and low temperature. The contrast with the previous results is due to the
insufficient field range used ($< 5 \times10^4$ Oe), not enough to saturate the
ferritin uncompensated moment.

state when observed in X-rays a few years apart, switching from Compton-thin to

better understanding the nature of the variations. The Suzaku spectrum was
analyzed, and the results compared with previous ASCA and XMM-Newton
observations. The source was caught in a Compton-thin state, as in XMM-Newton,
but differently from ASCA. Comparing the Suzaku and XMM-Newton observations, a
variation in the column density of the absorber on a time scale of years is
discovered. A similar change, but on much shorter time scales (i.e. ks) may
also explain the count-rate variations during the Suzaku observations. A soft
excess is also present, likely due to continuum and line emission from
photoionized circumnuclear matter.

the Tomita-Takesaki theorem and the KMS condition that the canonical density
matrix contains the dynamics of the system provided we use a rescaling of time.
In this paper we show that the path integral form of the partition function
reveals a dynamics which is complementary of the one given by the
Tomita-Takesaki theorem. To do that we work in the spirit of a
Feynman'conjecture. We define the entropy as a measure of the disorder in space
time. By using an equilibrium condition we introduce a natural time scale that
it is precisely the one appearing in the Tomita-Takesaki theorem. For this time
scale depending on the temperature but not on the system properties our
definition of entropy is identical to the thermodynamic one. The underlying
dynamics associated with the partition function allows us to derive a
$\bf{H}$-$theorem$. It is obtained in the thermodynamic limit and provided we
are in a regime in which the thermal fluctuations are larger than the quantum
ones.
