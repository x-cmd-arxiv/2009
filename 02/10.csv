product of symmetric planes. For such manifolds, we prove that the Euler
characteristic is an obstruction to the existence of flat structures,
confirming an old conjecture proved by Milnor in dimension 2. In particular,
the Chern conjecture follows in these cases. The proof goes via a new sharp
Milnor--Wood inequality for Riemannian manifolds that are locally a product of
hyperbolic planes. Furthermore, we analyze the possible flat vector bundles
over such manifolds. Over closed Hilbert--Blumenthal modular varieties, we show
that there are finitely many flat structures with nonzero Euler number and none
of them corresponds to the tangent bundle. Some of the main results were
announced in C.R. Acad. Sci. Paris, Ser. I 346 (2008) 661-666.

moments from the muon and tau neutrinos to the sterile play the dominant role
in fixing the amount of active flavour suppression. We also show, through
numerical integration of the evolution equations, that the data from all solar
neutrino experiments except Borexino exhibit a clear preference for a sizable
magnetic field either in the convection zone or in the core and radiation zone.
This is possibly related to the fact that the data from the first set are
average ones taken during a period of mostly intense solar activity, whereas in
contrast Borexino data were taken during a period of quiet sun. We argue that
the solar neutrino experiments are capable of tracing the possible modulation
of the solar magnetic field. Those monitoring the high energy neutrinos, namely
the $^8 B$ flux, appear to be sensitive to a field modulation either in the
convection zone or in the core and radiation zone. Those monitoring the low
energy fluxes will be sensitive to the second type of solar field profiles
only. In this way Borexino alone may play an essential role, since it examines
both energy sectors, although experimental redundance from other experiments
will be most important.

classical BCS superconductor they are established simultaneously at Tc. In the
cuprates, however, an energy gap (pseudogap) extends above Tc. The origin of
this gap is one of the central issues in high temperature superconductivity.
Recent experimental evidence demonstrates that the pseudogap and the
superconducting gap are associated with different energy scales. It is however
not clear whether they coexist independently or compete. In order to understand
the physics of cuprates and improve their superconducting properties it is
vital to determine whether the pseudogap is friend or foe of high temperature
supercondctivity. Here we report evidence from angle resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) that the pseudogap and high temperature superconductivity
represent two competing orders. We find that there is a direct correlation
between a loss in the low energy spectral weight due to the pseudogap and a
decrease of the coherent fraction of paired electrons. Therefore, the pseudogap
competes with the superconductivity by depleting the spectral weight available
for pairing in the region of momentum space where the superconducting gap is
largest. This leads to a very unusual state in the underdoped cuprates, where
only part of the Fermi surface develops coherence.

new coordinate system (X,Y), where $X=\sqrt{a_1} \sin \theta$,
$Y=\sqrt{a_1}\cos \theta$ and $a_1$ is the radial component of the magnetic
field. In this coordinate system, the 1+2-dimensional evolution equation
describing the quasi-periodic oscillations, QPOs, see Sotani et al. (2007), is
reduced to a 1+1-dimensional equation, where the perturbations propagate only
along the Y-axis. We solve the 1+1-dimensional equation for different boundary
conditions and open magnetic field lines, i.e., magnetic field lines that reach
the surface and there match up with the exterior dipole magnetic field, as well
as closed magnetic lines, i.e., magnetic lines that never reach the stellar
surface. For the open field lines, we find two families of QPOs frequencies; a
family of ""lower"" QPOs frequencies which is located near the X-axis and a
family of ""upper"" frequencies located near the Y-axis. According to Levin
(2007), the fundamental frequencies of these two families can be interpreted as
the turning points of a continuous spectrum. We find that the upper frequencies
are constant multiples of the lower frequencies with a constant equaling 2n+1.
For the closed lines, the corresponding factor is n+1 . By these relations, we
can explain both the lower and the higher observed frequencies in SGR 1806-20

system with a given number $m$ of electrons occupying a given number $n$ of
spin orbitals. Each spin orbital is mapped to a qubit: the states $| 1 >$ and
$| 0>$ of the qubit represent, respectively, whether the spin orbital is
occupied by an electron or not. To prepare a general state in the full Hilbert
space of $n$ qubits, which is of dimension $2^{n}$%, $O(2^{n})$ controlled-NOT
gates are needed, i.e., the number of gates scales \emph{exponentially} with
the number of qubits. We make use of the fact that the state to be prepared
lies in a smaller Hilbert space, and we find an algorithm that requires at most
$O(2^{m+1} n^{m}/{m!})$ gates, i.e., scales \emph{polynomially} with the number
of qubits $n$, provided $n\gg m$. The algorithm is simulated numerically for
the cases of the hydrogen molecule and the water molecule. The numerical
simulations show that when additional symmetries of the system are considered,
the number of gates to prepare the state can be drastically reduced, in the
examples considered in this paper, by several orders of magnitude, from the
above estimate.

have been developed for different kinds of networks. Here $A$ is defined by
$A_{ij} = 1$ ($A_{ij} = 0$) if there is (is not) a directed network link to $i$
from $j$. However, in at least two recent problems involving networks with
heterogeneous node properties (percolation on a directed network and the
stability of Boolean models of gene networks), an analogous but different
eigenvalue problem arises, namely, that of finding the largest eigenvalue
$\lambda_Q$ of the matrix $Q$, where $Q_{ij} = q_i A_{ij}$ and the `bias' $q_i$
may be different at each node $i$. (In the previously mentioned percolation and
gene network contexts, $q_i$ is a probability and so lies in the range $0 \le

considerations of the maximum eigenvalue $\lambda_A$ of $A$ to $\lambda_Q$, to
develop suitable analytic approximations to $\lambda_Q$, and to test these
approximations with numerical experiments. In particular, three issues
considered are (i) the effect of the correlation (or anticorrelation) between
the value of $q_i$ and the number of links to and from node $i$; (ii) the
effect of correlation between the properties of two nodes at either end of a
network link (`assortativity'); and (iii) the effect of community structure

different communities.

modeled as relativistic stars with a dipolar magnetic field. We use the
anelastic approximation to general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, which
allows for an effective suppression of fluid modes and an accurate description
of Alfven waves. In addition, we compute Alfven oscillation frequencies along
individual magnetic field lines with a semi-analytic approach, employing a
short-wavelength approximation. Our main findings are as follows: a) we confirm
the existence of two families of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), with
harmonics at integer multiples of the fundamental frequency, as was found in
the linear study of Sotani, Kokkotas & Stergioulas; b) the QPOs appearing near
the magnetic axis are split into two groups, depending on their symmetry across
the equatorial plane. The antisymmetric QPOs have only odd integer-multiple
harmonics; c) the continuum obtained with our semi-analytic approach agrees
remarkably well with QPOs obtained via the two-dimensional simulations,
allowing for a clear interpretation of the QPOs as corresponding to turning
points of the continuum. This agreement will allow for a comprehensive study of
Alfven QPOs for a larger number of different models, without the need for
time-consuming simulations. Finally, we construct empirical relations for the
QPO frequencies and compare them to observations of known Soft Gamma Repeaters.
We find that, under the assumptions of our model and if the magnetic field of
magnetars is characterized by a strong dipolar component, and QPOs are produced
near the magnetic pole, then one can place an upper limit to the mean surface
strength of the magnetic field of about 3-8 10^15 G.

in addition to the Higgs doublet. Due to the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone nature of

considerations alone. We find that the mass of eta can be naturally light,
opening up the possibility that the SM Higgs decays predominantly to the
singlet, and therefore lowering the LEP bound on its mass to 86 GeV. We also
show that eta can have interesting consequences in flavour-violating processes,
as well as induce spontaneous CP-violation in the Higgs sector. The model can
also have anomalies, giving rise to interactions between the SM gauge bosons
and eta which, if measured at the LHC, would give quantitative information
about the structure of the high energy theory.

Exactness property of the long intertwining functor on a cell subquotient of
the Harish-Chandra bimodules category shows that the truncated convolution
category can be realized as a subquotient of the category of Harish-Chandra
bimodules. Together with the description of the truncated convolution category
arXiv:math/0605628v3 this allows us to derive classification of irreducible
character sheaves over $\mathbb C$ obtained by Lusztig by a different method.
  We also give a simple description for the top cohomology of convolution of
character sheaves over $\mathbb C$ in a given cell modulo smaller cells and
relate the so-called Harish-Chandra functor to Verdier specialization in the De
Concini-Procesi compactification.

as well as on the growth history of the large-scale structure. In this paper,
we follow the growth of the cosmic density field in early dark energy
cosmologies by combining observations of the primary CMB temperature and
polarisation power spectra at high redshift, of the CMB lensing deflection
field at intermediate redshift and of weak cosmic shear at low redshifts for
constraining the allowed amount of early dark energy. We present these
forecasts using the Fisher-matrix formalism and consider the combination of
Planck-data with the weak lensing survey of Euclid. We find that combining
these data sets gives powerful constraints on early dark energy and is able to
break degeneracies in the parameter set inherent to the various observational
channels. The derived statistical 1-sigma-bound on the early dark energy
density parameter is sigma(Omega_d^e)=0.0022 which suggests that early dark
energy models can be well examined in our approach. In addition, we derive the
dark energy figure of merit for the considered dark energy parameterisation and
comment on the applicability of the growth index to early dark energy
cosmologies.

Calbet (LMC) and Shiner, Davison and Landsberg (SDL) are calculated as
functions of the number of particles for four quantum many-body systems, i.e.
atoms, nuclei, atomic clusters, and correlated atoms in a trap (bosons). A pair
of order and disorder strengths, evaluated for each system, can serve as a Pair
of Order-Disorder Indices (PODI), characterizing quantitatively order versus
disorder in any quantum system. According to the above classification, we
assign to bosons the complexity character of disorder, to atoms the character
of order, while nuclei and atomic clusters are (less) disordered and lie
between them. This criterion can be used to estimate the relative contribution
of order and disorder to complexity for other more complicated quantum systems
as well and even classical ones, if one is able to describe them
probabilistically. We also address the issue, whether those systems can grow in
complexity as the number of particles increases. Our comparative study
indicates that atoms are the only quantum system out of four, which is ordered,
with the ability to self-organize. We conjecture that this is an
information-theoretic reason that atoms are suitable as building blocks of
larger structures of biological interest i.e. molecules and macromolecules.

the effective coupling via medium polarization significantly exceeds the

aggressively decelerate the molecular packet using a high phase angle. This
technique brings the molecular packet to the desired velocity before it reaches
the end of the decelerator; the remaining stages are then used to
longitudinally and transversely guide the packet to the detection/interaction

phase-space acceptance of the decelerator and thus a narrowing of the velocity
spread of the molecular packet. In addition to the narrower energy spread, this

dimensions have considered spherical shapes, and it is only more recently that
nonspherical shapes (e.g., ellipsoids) have been investigated. Superballs
(whose shapes are defined by |x1|^2p + |x2|^2p + |x3|^2p <= 1) provide a
versatile family of convex particles (p >= 0.5) with both cubic- and
octahedral-like shapes as well as concave particles (0 < p < 0.5) with
octahedral-like shapes. In this paper, we provide analytical constructions for
the densest known superball packings for all convex and concave cases. The
candidate maximally dense packings are certain families of Bravais lattice
packings. The maximal packing density as a function of p is nonanalytic at the
sphere-point (p = 1) and increases dramatically as p moves away from unity. The
packing characteristics determined by the broken rotational symmetry of
superballs are similar to but richer than their two-dimensional ""superdisk""
counterparts, and are distinctly different from that of ellipsoid packings. Our
candidate optimal superball packings provide a starting point to quantify the
equilibrium phase behavior of superball systems, which should deepen our
understanding of the statistical thermodynamics of nonspherical-particle

this metric remained incompletely characterized. Here we present an exploration

investigations of the underlying assumptions, we use both real and simulated

when used as a means by which to identify individuals as members of a

that the misclassifications stem from violations of assumptions that are
crucial to the technique yet hard to control in practice, and we explore the
feasibility of several methods to improve the sensitivity. Additionally, we
find that the specificity may still be lower than expected even in ideal
circumstances. However, despite the metric's inadequacies for identifying the
presence of an individual in a sample, our results suggest potential avenues
for future research on tuning this method to problems of ancestry inference or

intensities of the principal Raman transitions, the radial breathing mode

three orders of magnitude. In the supported part of the CNT, despite a loss of
Raman scattering intensity of up to two orders of magnitude, we recover the E33
excitonic resonance suffering a substrate-induced red shift of 50 meV. The peak
intensity ratio between G-band and D-band is highly sensitive to the presence
of the substrate and varies by one order of magnitude, demonstrating the much
higher defect density in the supported CNT segments. By comparing the E33
resonance spectra measured by Raman excitation spectroscopy and
photoluminescence (PL) excitation spectroscopy in the suspended CNT segment, we
observe that the peak energy in the PL excitation spectrum is red-shifted by 40
meV. This shift is associated with the energy difference between the localized
exciton dominating the PL excitation spectrum and the free exciton giving rise
to the Raman excitation spectrum. High-resolution Raman spectra reveal
substrate-induced symmetry breaking, as evidenced by the appearance of
additional peaks in the strongly broadened Raman G band. Laser-induced line
shifts of RBM and G band measured on the suspended CNT segment are both linear
as a function of the laser excitation power. Stokes/anti-Stokes measurements,

(MBH) pairs in rotationally supported circumnuclear discs up to the point where
MBHs form binary systems. Our simulations have high resolution in mass and
space which, for the first time, makes it feasible to follow the orbital decay
of a MBH either counter- or co-rotating with respect to the circumnuclear disc.
We show that a moving MBH on an initially counter-rotating orbit experiences an
""orbital angular momentum flip"" due to the gas-dynamical friction, i.e., it
starts to corotate with the disc before a MBH binary forms. We stress that this
effect can only be captured in very high resolution simulations. Given the
extremely large number of gas particles used, the dynamical range is
sufficiently large to resolve the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton radii of individual
MBHs. As a consequence, we are able to link the accretion processes to the
orbital evolution of the MBH pairs. We predict that the accretion rate is
significantly suppressed and extremely variable when the MBH is moving on a
retrograde orbit. It is only after the orbital angular momentum flip has taken
place that the secondary rapidly ""lights up"" at which point both MBHs can
accrete near the Eddington rate for a few Myr. The separation of the double
nucleus is expected to be around ~10 pc at this stage. We show that the
accretion rate can be highly variable also when the MBH is co-rotating with the
disc (albeit to a lesser extent) provided that its orbit is eccentric. Our
results have significant consequences for the expected number of observable
double AGNs at separations of <100 pc.

curves with the package XRONOS. The spectrum can be fitted with a highly
absorbed hard X-ray component from an optically-thin hot plasma, a Gaussian
emission line with an energy of 6.1 keV and a less absorbed soft thermal
component. The best fit is obtained with a model in which the hot component is
produced by optically thin thermal emission from an isobaric cooling flow with
a maximum temperature of 61 keV, which might be created inside an
optically-thin boundary layer on the surface of the accreting with dwarf. The
derived parameters of the hard component detected in MWC 560 are in good
agreement with similar objects as CH Cyg, SS7317, RT Cru and T CrB, which all
form a new sub-class of symbiotic stars emitting hard X-rays. Our previous
numerical simulations of the jet in MWC 560 showed that it should produce
detectable soft X-ray emission. We infer a temperature of 0.17 keV for the
observed soft component, i.e. less than expected from our models. The total
soft X-ray flux (i.e. at < 3 keV) is more than a factor 100 less than predicted
for the propagating jet soon after its birth (<0.3 yr), but consistent with the
value expected due its decrease with age. The ROSAT upper limit is also
consistent with such a decrease. We find aperiodic or quasi-periodic
variability on timescales of minutes and hours, but no periodic rapid
variability. All results are consistent with an accreting white dwarf powering
the X-ray emission and the existence of an optically-thin boundary layer around
it.

NICMOS F160W) shows large scale sizes (R_(1/2)~0.75"", diameters ~12kpc) and SED
fitting to photometric points (optical through the mid-IR) reveals massive
(~5x10^(11) M_sun), old (a few Gyr) stellar populations. Both sources have low
flux densities at observed 24um and are undetected in observed 70um and 850um,
suggesting a low mass of interstellar dust. They are also formally undetected
in the ultra-deep 2Ms Chandra data, suggesting that any AGN activity is likely
intrinsically weak. We suggest both galaxies have evolved stellar populations,
low star formation rates, and low accretion rates onto massive black holes
(10^(8.6) M_sun) whose radio luminosity is weakly beamed (by factors of a few).
A cluster-like environment has been identified near HDF130 by an over-density

evolution in galaxy populations. These observations suggest that
high-resolution radio (MERLIN) can be a superb diagnostic tool of AGN in the

foresees growth mostly through merging. Galaxies in the infall region or in the
core of a cluster undergo transformations owing to different environmental
stresses. For two X-ray luminous clusters at redshift z ~ 0.3 with opposite
X-ray morphologies, RXCJ0014.3-3022 and RXCJ2308.3-0211, we assess differences
in galaxy populations as a function of cluster topography. Cluster large-scale
structure and substructure are determined from the combined photometry in the
B, V, and R bands, and from multi-object optical spectroscopy at low
resolution. A spectral index analysis is performed, based on the [OII] and
Hdelta features, and the D4000 break, available for more than 100 member
galaxies per cluster. Combination of spectral indices and FUV-optical colours
provides a picture of the star formation history in galaxies. In spite of the
potential presence of a small fraction of galaxies with obscured star formation
activity, the average star-formation history of cluster members is found to
depend on cluster-centric distance and on substructure. There is a sharp
increase in star formation activity along two well-defined filamentary
structures of the merging cluster RXCJ0014.3-3022, out to its virial radius and
beyond, produced by luminous (L ~ L*) and sub-L* galaxies. Conversely, the
regular cool-core cluster RXCJ2308.3-0211 mostly hosts galaxies which either
populate the red sequence or are becoming passive. These results suggest the
existence of a correspondence between assembly state and overall age of the
stellar populations of galaxies inside the virialized region and in the
surrounding large scale structure of massive clusters at z ~ 0.3. (Abridged)

We present observations of 4 transits with the Near Infrared Camera and
Multi-Object Spectrometer on the Hubble Space Telescope, within a wavelength
range of 1.1--2.0 $\mu$m. Analysis of the light curve gives the most precise
estimate yet of the stellar mean density, $\rho_\star =
0.497^{+0.042}_{-0.057}$ g cm$^{-3}$. By requiring agreement between the
observed stellar properties (including $\rho_\star$) and stellar evolutionary
models, we refine the estimate of the stellar radius: $R_\star =
1.541^{+0.046}_{-0.042}$ $R_\sun$. We also find a deeper transit than has been
measured at optical and mid-infrared wavelengths. Taken together, these
findings imply a planetary radius of $R_p = 0.813^{+0.027}_{-0.025}$ $R_{\rm
Jup}$, which is larger than earlier estimates. Models of the planetary interior
still require a metal-enriched composition, although the required degree of
metal enrichment is reduced. It is also possible that the deeper NICMOS transit
is caused by wavelength-dependent absorption by constituents in the planet's
atmosphere, although simple model atmospheres do not predict this effect to be
strong enough to account for the discrepancy. We use the 4 newly-measured
transit times to compute a refined transit ephemeris.

that the phase transition in this model is a Kosterlitz--Thouless transition

driven by the unbinding of two-dimensional pancake vortices, an RG analysis of
the low temperature phase and a mean-field theory of the high temperature phase

Detailed analysis of the large disks in our sample provides strong evidence
that this population cannot result from a merger-dominated formation history

filaments. These systems will then secularly evolve from clump-dominated disks
to bulge-dominated disks on short timescales, a phenomenon that is observed in

about 12 years starting from mid-1996 (the minimum of cycle 23) to early-2008
(near minimum of cycle 24), corresponding to a nearly complete solar activity
cycle. We demonstrate that the frequencies do vary in phase with the solar
activity indices, however the degree of correlation differs from phase to phase
of the cycle. During the rising and declining phases, the mode frequency shifts
are strongly correlated with the activity proxies whereas during the
high-activity period, the shifts have significantly lower correlation with all
activity proxies, except for the 10.7-cm radio flux. In particular, the proxies
that are only influenced by the variation of the strong component of the
magnetic field in the photosphere have a much lower correlation at the
high-activity period. On the other hand, the shifts are better correlated with
the proxies sensitive to changes in the weak component of the magnetic field.
Our correlation analysis suggests that more than 90% of the variation in the
oscillation frequencies in all activity phases can be explained by changes in
both components of the magnetic field. Further, the slopes obtained from the
linear regression analysis also differ from phase to phase and show a strong
correlation with the correlation coefficients between frequency shifts and

self-Comptonization of intrinsically polarized synchrotron photons emitted by
jet electrons. Our simulations show that for Comptonization of disk and CMB
photons, the degree of polarization of the scattered photons increases with the
viewing inclination angle with respect to the jet axis. In both cases the
maximum linear polarization is approximately 20%. In the case of synchrotron
self-Comptonization (SSC), we find that the resulting X-ray polarization
depends strongly on the seed synchrotron photon injection site, with typical
fractional polarizations of approximately P = 10 - 20% when synchrotron
emission is localized near the jet base, while P = 20 - 70% for the case of
uniform emission throughout the jet. These results indicate that X-ray
polarimetry may be capable of providing unique clues to identify the location
of particle acceleration sites in relativistic jets. In particular, if
synchrotron photons are emitted quasi-uniformly throughout a jet, then the
observed degree of X-ray polarization may be sufficiently different for each of
the competing X-ray emission mechanisms (synchrotron, SSC or external
Comptonization) to determine which is the dominant process. However, X-ray
polarimetry alone is unlikely to be able to distinguish between disk and CMB
Comptonization.

theories: they evade the ""no-hair"" theorem of General Relativity but were

distinguish them from black holes in General Relativity. We start by extending
previous works and establishing the stability of these black holes against
axial perturbations. We then look for solutions of the field equations

geometry. Depending on the values of mass, dilaton charge and angular momentum
of the solution, one can have measurable differences in the ISCO location and
orbital frequency, relatively to black holes in General Relativity. Such
differences may be useful in future experiments, to discriminate between

to the production function where the output of firms is completely
deterministic. We demonstrate empirical construction of a production copula
using financial data of listed firms in Japan. Analysis of the data shows that
there are significant correlations among their capital, labor and value added
and confirms that the values added are too widely scattered to be represented
by a production function. We employ four models for the production copula, that

Magellanic Cloud (LMC), using the recently completed second NANTEN CO survey.
In particular, we investigate correlations between CO integrated intensity and
HI integrated intensity, peak brightness temperature, and line width at a
resolution of 2.6' (~40 pc). We find that significant HI column density and
peak brightness temperature are necessary but not sufficient conditions for CO
detection, with many regions of strong HI emission not associated with
molecular clouds. The large scatter in CO intensities for a given HI intensity
persists even when averaging on scales of >200 pc, indicating that the scatter
is not solely due to local conversion of HI into H_2 near GMCs. We focus on two
possibilities to account for this scatter: either there exist spatial
variations in the I(CO) to N(H_2) conversion factor, or a significant fraction
of the atomic gas is not involved in molecular cloud formation. A weak tendency
for CO emission to be suppressed for large HI linewidths supports the second
hypothesis, insofar as large linewidths may be indicative of warm HI, and calls
into question the likelihood of forming molecular clouds from colliding HI
flows. We also find that the ratio of molecular to atomic gas shows no
significant correlation (or anti-correlation) with the stellar surface density,
though a correlation with midplane hydrostatic pressure P_h is found when the
data are binned in P_h. The latter correlation largely reflects the increasing
likelihood of CO detection at high HI column density.

two main structures, namely collagens as well as axial, parallel and regular
anionic glycosaminoglycan between collagens. The collagen fibril can be modeled
by Hooke's law whereas anionic glycosaminoglycan behaves more like a
rubber-band rod and as such can be better modeled by the worm-like chain model.
While both computer simulations and continuum mechanics models have been
investigated the behavior of this connective tissue typically, authors either
assume a simple form of the molecular potential energy or entirely ignore the
microscopic structure of the connective tissue. Here, we apply basic physical
methodologies and simple applied mathematical modeling techniques to describe
the collagen pair quantitatively. We find that the growth of fibrils is
intimately related to the maximum length of the anionic glycosaminoglycan and
the relative displacement of two adjacent fibrils, which in return is closely
related to the effectiveness of anionic glycosaminoglycan in transmitting
forces between fibrils. These reveal the importance of the anionic
glycosaminoglycan in maintaining the structural shape of the connective tissue
extracellular matrix and eventually the shape modulus of human tissues. We also
find that some macroscopic properties, like the maximum molecular energy and
the breaking fraction of the collagen, are also related to the microscopic
characteristics of the anionic glycosaminoglycan.

particularly interesting as they could impact the Cepheid distance scale, and
imply stellar mass loss. Aims: Our goal is to establish the spatial and
spectral properties of the CSEs of L Car and RS Pup. This is done through a
parametrization of the envelopes in terms of fractional flux (with respect to
the star) and angular size. - Methods: We retrieved archival Spitzer images of
the two stars (3.5-70 mic), and obtained new imaging with the VLT/VISIR camera
in BURST mode (8.6-11.9 mic), as well as interferometry with VLTI/MIDI (8-13
mic). This combination allows us to probe the envelopes over arcminute to
milliarcsecond scales. - Results: The CSE of RS Pup is resolved at 24 and 70
mic by Spitzer, and around 10 mic by MIDI and VISIR. The compact envelope of L
Car is resolved only in the VISIR and MIDI observations. However, the
properties of the IR excesses differ considerably : a warm component is present
around both stars at a spatial scale of a few 100 to a few 1 000 AU, but RS Pup
presents in addition a large (several 100 000 AU) and cold (~40 K) dusty
envelope. - Conclusions: We propose that the reflection nebula surrounding RS
Pup has an interstellar origin, while the warm CSEs of both stars were created
by ongoing stellar mass loss. Such warm circumstellar envelopes are probably
common around Cepheids.

entropy of a minimally coupled scalar field in the Schwarzschild black hole
background using the brick wall model of 't Hooft. In the original article, the
WKB approximation was used for the modes that are globally stationary. In a
previous article, we found that the WKB quantization rule together with a
proper counting of the states, leads to a new expression of the scalar field
entropy which is not proportional to the area of the horizon. The expression of
the entropy is logarithmically divergent in the brick wall cut-off parameter in
contrast to an inverse power divergence obtained earlier. In this article, we
will consider the entropy for a thin shell of matter field of a given thickness
surrounding the black hole horizon. The thickness is chosen to be large
compared with the Planck length and is of the order of the atomic scale. When
expressed in terms of a covariant cut-off parameter, the entropy of a thin
shell of matter field of a given thickness and surrounding the horizon in the
Schwarzschild black hole background is given by an expression proportional to
the area of the black hole horizon. This leading order divergent term in the
cut-off parameter remains to be logarithmically divergent. The logarithmic
divergence is expected from the nature of the solution in the near-horizon
region. We will find that these discussions are significant in the context of
the continuation to the Euclidean sector and the corresponding regularization
schemes used to evaluate the thermodynamical properties of matter fields in
curved spaces. These are related with the geometric aspects of curved spaces.
The above discussions are also important in presence of cosmological event
horizon.

a global gauge symmetry familiar from quantum field theory. This symmetry leads
to a multiple counting of infinitely many inertial reference frames in the path
integral approach to randomly stirred fluids. This problem is solved by fixing
the gauge, i.e., singling out one reference frame. The gauge fixed theory has
an underlying Becchi-Rouet-Stora (BRS) symmetry which leads to the Ward
identity relating the exact inverse response and vertex functions. This
identification of Galilean invariance as a gauge symmetry is explored in
detail, for different gauge choices and by performing a rigorous examination of
a discretized version of the theory. The Navier-Stokes equation is also
invariant under arbitrary rectilinear frame accelerations, known as extended
Galilean invariance (EGI). We gauge fix this extended symmetry and derive the
generalized Ward identity that follows from the BRS invariance of the
gauge-fixed theory. This new Ward identity reduces to the standard one in the
limit of zero acceleration. This gauge-fixing approach unambiguously shows that
Galilean invariance and EGI constrain only the zero mode of the vertex but none
of the higher wavenumber modes.

investigated. Spray cycles are scheduled at intervals two days short of the
first interlarval period and halted once the last of the female flies that
originated from pre-spray-deposited pupae have been sprayed twice. The effect
of temperature on the aerial spraying of tsetse, through its reproductive cycle
and general population dynamics, is of particular interest, given that cooler
weather is preferred for the settling of insecticidal droplets. Spray efficacy
is found to come at a price due to the greater number of cycles necessitated by
cooler weather. The extra cost is argued to be worth while. Pupae, still in the
ground at the end of spraying, are identified as the main threat to a
successful operation. They are slightly more vulnerable at the low temperature
extreme of tsetse habitat (16 $^\circ$C), when the cumulative, natural pupal
mortality is high. One can otherwise base one's expectations on the closeness
with which the time to the third last spray approaches one puparial duration. A
disparity of anything close to the length of a spray cycle advocates caution,
whereas one which comes close to vanishing should be interpreted as being
auspicious. Three such key temperatures, just below which one can anticipate an
improved outcome and just above which caution should be exercised, are 17.146
$^\circ$C, 19.278 $^\circ$C and 23.645 $^\circ$C. A refinement of the existing
formulae for the puparial duration and the first interlarval period might be

$d$-regular bipartite graphs with $2n$ vertices and $m = nd$ edges. While the
best-known algorithm for general bipartite graphs (due to Hopcroft and Karp)
takes $O(m \sqrt{n})$ time, in regular bipartite graphs, a perfect matching is
known to be computable in $O(m)$ time. Very recently, the $O(m)$ bound was
improved to $O(\min\{m, \frac{n^{2.5}\ln n}{d}\})$ expected time, an expression
that is bounded by $\tilde{O}(n^{1.75})$. In this paper, we further improve
this result by giving an $O(\min\{m, \frac{n^2\ln^3 n}{d}\})$ expected time
algorithm for finding a perfect matching in regular bipartite graphs; as a
function of $n$ alone, the algorithm takes expected time $O((n\ln n)^{1.5})$.
  To obtain this result, we design and analyze a two-stage sampling scheme that
reduces the problem of finding a perfect matching in a regular bipartite graph
to the same problem on a subsampled bipartite graph with $O(n\ln n)$ edges that
has a perfect matching with high probability. The matching is then recovered
using the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm. While the standard analysis of Hopcroft-Karp
gives us an $\tilde{O}(n^{1.5})$ running time, we present a tighter analysis
for our special case that results in the stronger $\tilde{O}(\min\{m,
\frac{n^2}{d} \})$ time mentioned earlier.
  Our proof of correctness of this sampling scheme uses a new correspondence
theorem between cuts and Hall's theorem ``witnesses'' for a perfect matching in
a bipartite graph that we prove. We believe this theorem may be of independent
interest; as another example application, we show that a perfect matching in
the support of an $n \times n$ doubly stochastic matrix with $m$ non-zero
entries can be found in expected time $\tilde{O}(m + n^{1.5})$.

smaller than the analytical prediction by Philip et al. [1] for an infinitely

us to construct a perfect cloner, there is no restriction to construct an
imperfect cloner. Therefore, we have constructed and studied a special kind of
quantum cloning machine named as Hybrid quantum cloning machine which is
nothing but a different combination of pre-existing quantum cloning machines.
We showed that this hybrid quantum cloning machine sometime gives better
quality copy than the pre-existing quantum cloners. Quantum entanglement is a
very astonishing property in a multi-partite system and it is a very useful
ingredient of quantum information theory. Therefore broadcasting (cloning) of
entanglement is a very important subject to study. In this regard we have
studied the broadcasting of entanglement using state dependent quantum cloning
machine. Further, we have investigated the problem of secretly broadcasting of
three-qubit entangled state between two distant partners. Linearity of quantum
mechanics put another restriction on deletion of an arbitrary quantum state
i.e. an arbitrary quantum state against a copy cannot be perfectly deleted.
Like cloning machine one can construct an approximate deletion machine also.
Therefore, we have constructed an universal deletion machine in the sense that
the fidelity of deletion does not depend on the input state and showed that the
fidelity of deletion is 3/4 . Further we showed that the fidelity of deletion
depends on the blank state at the output and it can be improved from the value
3/4 for certain blank state. Moreover, we have studied the case where two
cloned copies are given at the input of the deletion machine.

goal is to establish what would be the characteristic imprints of a merger
origin for the Galactic thick disc. We find that the spatial distribution
predicted for thick disc stars is asymmetric, seemingly in agreement with
recent observations of the Milky Way thick disc. Near the Sun, the accreted
stars are expected to rotate more slowly, to have broad velocity distributions,
and to occupy preferentially the wings of the line-of-sight velocity
distributions. The majority of the stars in our model thick discs have low
eccentricity orbits (in clear reference to the pre-existing heated disc) which
gives rise to a characteristic (sinusoidal) pattern for their line of sight
velocities as function of galactic longitude. The z-component of the angular
momentum of thick disc stars provides a clear discriminant between stars from
the pre-existing disc and those from the satellite, particularly at large
radii. These results are robust against the particular choices of initial
conditions made in our simulations, and thus provide clean tests of the disc
heating via a minor merger scenario for the formation of thick discs.

global optimization on real domains. The interest has been focused on
multimodal problems, where the difficulties of a premature convergence usually
occurs. First the standard genetic algorithm (SGA) using binary encoding of
real values and its unsatisfactory behavior with multimodal problems is briefly
reviewed together with some improvements of fighting premature convergence. Two
types of real encoded methods based on differential operators are examined in
detail: the differential evolution (DE), a very modern and effective method
firstly published by R. Storn and K. Price, and the simplified real-coded
differential genetic algorithm SADE proposed by the authors. In addition, an
improvement of the SADE method, called CERAF technology, enabling the
population of solutions to escape from local extremes, is examined. All methods
are tested on an identical set of objective functions and a systematic
comparison based on a reliable methodology is presented. It is confirmed that
real coded methods generally exhibit better behavior on real domains than the
binary algorithms, even when extended by several improvements. Furthermore, the
positive influence of the differential operators due to their possibility of
self-adaptation is demonstrated. From the reliability point of view, it seems
that the real encoded differential algorithm, improved by the technology
described in this paper, is a universal and reliable method capable of solving
all proposed test problems.

low-frequency transport properties of hybrid structures, consisting of
spatially-separated conventional low-temperature superconductor (S) and
ferromagnet (F), is reviewed. Since the superconducting and ferromagnetic parts
are assumed to be electrically insulated, no proximity effect is present and
thus the interaction between both subsystems is through their respective
magnetic stray fields. Depending on the temperature range and the value of the
external field H_{ext}, different behavior of such S/F hybrids is anticipated.
Rather close to the superconducting phase transition line, when the
superconducting state is only weakly developed, the magnetization of the
ferromagnet is solely determined by the magnetic history of the system and it
is not influenced by the field generated by the supercurrents. In contrast to
that, the nonuniform magnetic field pattern, induced by the ferromagnet,
strongly affect the nucleation of superconductivity leading to an exotic
dependence of the critical temperature T_{c} on H_{ext}. Deeper in the
superconducting state the effect of the screening currents cannot be neglected
anymore. In this region of the phase diagram various aspects of the interaction
between vortices and magnetic inhomogeneities are discussed. In the last
section we briefly summarize the physics of S/F hybrids when the magnetization
of the ferromagnet is no longer fixed but can change under the influence of the
superconducting currents. As a consequence, the superconductor and ferromagnet
become truly coupled and the equilibrium configuration of this ""soft"" S/F
hybrids requires rearrangements of both, superconducting and ferromagnetic
characteristics, as compared with ""hard"" S/F structures.

angles for 14302 SDSS galaxies with $r$ magnitudes brighter than 18 and which

separate populations of galaxies using the colour, concentration and their
principal components. Surprisingly strong statistical alignments are found:
late-type galaxies are overwhelmingly biased towards a position angle
differences of $0^{\circ}$ and early-type galaxies to $90^{\circ}$. The
late-type alignment can be easily understood in terms of the standard picture
in which the radio emission is intimately related to areas of recent
star-formation. In early-type galaxies the radio emission is expected to be
driven by accretion on to a nuclear black hole. We argue that the observed
correlation of the radio axis with the minor axis of the large-scale stellar
distribution gives a fundamental insight into the structure of elliptical
galaxies, for example, whether or not the nuclear kinematics are decoupled form
the rest of the galaxy. Our results imply that the galaxies are oblate
spheroids with their radio emission aligned with the minor axis. Remarkably the
strength of the correlation of the radio major axis with the optical minor axis
depends on radio loudness. Those objects with a low ratio of FIRST radio flux
density to total stellar light show a strong minor axis correlation while the
stronger radio sources do not. This may reflect different formation histories
for the different objects and we suggest we may be seeing the different
behaviour of rationally supported and non-rotationally supported ellipticals.

ranging from 1 to 100 Earth-mass planets. It relies on the assumption that
solid spheres are composed of iron and silicates, around which a variable
amount of water is added. The M-R law has been set up assuming that the
planetary composition is similar to the averaged composition for silicates and
iron obtained from the major elements ratio of 94 stars hosting exoplanets.
Except on Earth for which a tremendous amount of data is available, the
composition of silicate mantles and metallic cores cannot be constrained.
Similarly, thermal profiles are poorly known. In this work, the effect of
compositional parameters and thermal profiles on radii estimates is quantified.
It will be demonstrated that uncertainties related to composition and
temperature are of second order compared to the effect of the water amount. The
Super-Earths family includes four classes of planets: iron-rich, silicate-rich,
water-rich, or with a thick atmosphere. For a given mass, the planetary radius
increases significantly from the ironrich to the atmospheric-rich planet. Even
if some overlaps are likely, M-R measurements could be accurate enough to
ascertain the discovery of an earth-like planet .The present work describes how
the amount of water can be assessed from M-R measurements. Such an estimate
depends on several assumptions including i) the accuracy of the internal
structure model and ii) the accuracy of mass and radius measurements. It is
shown that if the mass and the radius are perfectly known, the standard
deviation on the amount of water is about 4.5 %. This value increases rapidly
with the radius uncertainty but does not strongly depend on the mass
uncertainty.

changes in the irradiance to the Earth. These changes in the forcing are to
small to explain the observed climate variations as simple linear responses.
Non-linear amplifications are necessary to account for the glacial cycles. Here
an empirical model of the non-linear response is presented. From the model it
is possible to assess the role of stochastic noise in comparison to the
deterministic orbital forcing of the ice ages. The model is based on the
bifurcation structure derived from the climate history. It indicates the
dynamical origin of the Mid-Pleistocene transition (MPT) from the '41 kyr
world' to the '100 kyr world'. The dominant forcing in the latter is still the
41 kyr obliquity cycle, but the bifurcation structure of the climate system is
changed. The model indicates that transitions between glacial and interglacial
climate are assisted by internal stochastic noise in the period prior to the
last five glacial cycles, while the last five cycles are deterministic
responses to the orbital forcing.

K for the hot companion. The infrared colours allow us to classify this object
as an S-type symbiotic star, comprising a red giant losing mass to a compact
companion. The red giant is an AGB carbon star, and a semi-regular variable,
pulsating in the first overtone with a period of 142 days. Its bolometric
magnitude is M_bol=-4.4 mag.
  We review what is known about the luminosities of extragalactic symbiotic
stars, showing that most, possibly all, contain AGB stars. We suggest that a
much larger fraction of Galactic symbiotic stars may contain AGB stars than was
previously realised.

unveiled that the ground state fidelity per lattice site exhibits such a

The significance of this result lies in the fact that the ground state fidelity

sputtering techniques the first layer is always found at the bottom of the
sputtered crater. Since the depth resolution decreases during sputtering, the
analysis of the first few layers are difficult. In order to circumvent this
problem, we used reverse Secondary Neutral Mass Spectrometry (SNMS) depth
profiling method for electrodeposited multilayered films. We prepared thin film
samples in two ways. First, Co/Cu multilayer stacks were electrodeposited on
Si/Cr/Cu substrates and SNMS depth profiling was carried out from the direction
of the topmost layer. Secondly, elecrodeposited Co/Cu multilayer stacks were
coated with a few microns thick Ni layer and detached from the Si substrate in
order to study the film structure from the side of the substrate. Using this

with 1.5 ml/min flow-rate have similar behaviour at 450 oC, but at 400 oC the
decay of the first order SAXRD peaks was slower than in case of the
non-hydrogenated multilayers. Qualitatively the observed behaviour can be
explained by the fast desorption of the saturated hydrogen, leading to the
formation of bubbles and craters at 450 oC, as well as, at 400oC in the sample
with lower H-content, by the possible passivation of the dangling bonds
resulting in a slowing down of the diffusion intermixing.

with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) at a frequency of 328 MHz.
The survey pioneered a novel interferometric observing mode, termed 8gr8
(eight-grate), whereby multiple simultaneous digital beams provide high
sensitivity over a large field of view. Since the Cygnus region is known to
contain OB associations, it is likely that pulsars are formed here. Simulations
have shown that this survey could detect 70 pulsars, which would increase our
understanding of the radio pulsar population in this region. We also aim to
expand the known population of intermittent and rotating radio transient
(RRAT)-like pulsars. In this paper we describe our methods of observation,
processing and data analysis, and we present the first results. Our observing
method exploits the way a regularly spaced, linear array of telescopes yields a
corresponding regularly spaced series of so-called ``grating'' beams on the
sky. By simultaneously forming a modest number (eight) of offset digital beams,
we can utilize the entire field of view of each WSRT dish, but retain the
coherently summed sensitivity of the entire array. For the processing we
performed a large number of trial combinations of period and dispersion measure
(DM) using a computer cluster. In the first processing cycle of the WSRT 8gr8
Cygnus Survey, we have discovered three radio pulsars, with spin periods of
1.657, 1.099 and 0.445 seconds. These pulsars have been observed on a regular
basis since their discovery, both in a special follow-up programme as well as
in the regular timing programme. The timing solutions are presented in this
paper. We also discuss this survey method in the context of the SKA and its
pathfinders.

promising and complementary tool for investigating the structure of the
electro-weak sector of the standard model, and for searching for new phenomena
revealing signs for an underlaying new symmetry. With the advent of new
technologies in particle trapping and production of beams for exotic nuclei as
well as ultracold neutrons, we expect one or two orders of magnitude gain in
precision. This corresponds to the progress expected by new high luminosity
B-factories or the LHC. Domains studied are $\beta$-decays where decay
correlations, partial or total decay rates may reveal the nature of the
left-right structure of the interaction and the investigation of discrete
symmetries. Here the search for a finite electric dipole moment which, due to
its CP-violating nature were sensational by itself, could shed light on the
structure of the vacuum at very small distances. Last but not least ideas of a
mirror world can be extended to the sector of baryons which can be studied with
neutrons.

prepared by sputtering have been studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to check the influence of annealing on
their structural stability. The annealed multilayers exhibit surface and bulk
degradation with formation of bumps and craters whose density and size increase
with increasing hydrogen content and/or annealing temperature and time. Bumps
are due to the formation of H2 bubbles in the multilayer. The craters are bumps
blown up very likely because of too high a gas pressure inside. The release of
H from its bonds to Si and Ge occurs within cavities very likely present in the
samples. The necessary energy is supplied by the heat treatment and by the
recombination of thermally generated carriers. Results by energy filtered TEM
on the interdiffusion of Si and Ge upon annealing are also presented.
