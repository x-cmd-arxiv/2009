nonzero temperature, focusing on magnetic order and superfluid-insulator
transitions. Firstly, Landau theory is used to find the general structure of
the phase diagram, and in particular to demonstrate the presence of first-order
transitions and hysteresis in the vicinity of a multicritical point. Secondly,
an explicit thermodynamic phase diagram is calculated using an approach based
on a field-theoretical description of the Bose-Hubbard model, which
incorporates the crucial effects of particle-number fluctuations. The maximum
transition temperature to a magnetically ordered Mott insulator is found to be
limited by the presence of the superfluid phase.

Here, we present a generic canonical model construction in the semantic

the radial density and temperature distribution of the ICM, and to derive the
gas mass fraction in the cluster under the assumption of hydrostatic
equilibrium. We used the isothermal beta model to fit the SZE
decrement/increment radial profiles. We performed a simple, non-parametric
de-projection of the radial density and temperature profiles, in conjunction
with XMM-Newton X-ray data, under the simplifying assumption of spherical
symmetry. We combined the peak SZE signals derived in this paper with published
SZE measurements of this cluster to derive the cluster line-of-sight bulk
velocity and the central Comptonization, using priors on the ICM temperature.
We find that the best-fit isothermal model to the SZE data is consistent with
the ICM properties implied by the X-ray data, particularly inside the central 1
Mpc radius. Although the assumptions of hydrostatic equilibrium and spherical
symmetry may not be optimal for this complex system, the results obtained under
these assumptions are consistent with X-ray and weak-lensing measurements. This
shows the applicability of the simple joint SZE and X-ray de-projection

  Science - STACS 2009 (2009) 433-444",,,"cs.FL cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The precise complexity of complementing B\""uchi automata is an intriguing and
long standing problem. While optimal complementation techniques for finite
automata are simple - it suffices to determinize them using a simple subset
construction and to dualize the acceptance condition of the resulting automaton
- B\""uchi complementation is more involved. Indeed, the construction of an
EXPTIME complementation procedure took a quarter of a century from the
introduction of B\""uchi automata in the early 60s, and stepwise narrowing the
gap between the upper and lower bound to a simple exponent (of (6e)n for
B\""uchi automata with n states) took four decades. While the distance between
the known upper (O'(0.96 n)n') and lower ('(0.76 n)n') bound on the required
number of states has meanwhile been significantly reduced, an exponential
factor remains between them. Also, the upper bound on the size of the
complement automaton is not linear in the bound of its state space. These gaps
are unsatisfactory from a theoretical point of view, but also because B\""uchi
complementation is a useful tool in formal verification, in particular for the
language containment problem. This paper proposes a B\""uchi complementation
algorithm whose complexity meets, modulo a quadratic (O(n2)) factor, the known
lower bound for B\""uchi complementation. It thus improves over previous
constructions by an exponential factor and concludes the quest for optimal
B\""uchi complementation algorithms.

AMBER (Astronomical Multi BEam combineR), the near infrared focal beam combiner

conclusions can be generalized to other single-mode instruments. We used the

the atmospheric turbulence effect after correction by the ESO system MACAO

the atmospheric turbulence for some zenith angles z and spectral conditions:
for z larger than 30{\circ} in J-band for example. The study of the optical

classical problem of density estimation and for density deconvolution from
noisy observations. By using such wavelets, the computation of the empirical
wavelet coefficients relies on the fast Fourier transform of the data and on
the fact that Meyer wavelets are band-limited functions. This makes such
estimators very simple to compute and this avoids the problem of evaluating
wavelets at non-dyadic points which is the main drawback of classical
wavelet-based density estimators. Our approach is based on term-by-term
thresholding of the empirical wavelet coefficients with random thresholds
depending on an estimation of the variance of each coefficient. Such estimators
are shown to achieve the same performances of an oracle estimator up to a
logarithmic term. These estimators also achieve near-minimax rates of
convergence over a large class of Besov spaces. A simulation study is proposed
to show the good finite sample performances of the estimator for both problems
of direct density estimation and density deconvolution.

derive the spectroscopic orbit for the white dwarf companion. Spectral
variations related to the 2006 outburst are also studied. The spectroscopic
orbits have been obtained by measuring the radial velocities of the cool
component absorption lines and the broad Halpha emission wings, which seem to
be associated with the hot component. A set of cF-type absorption lines were
also analyzed for a possible connection with the hot component motion. A new
period of 453.6 days and a mass ratio, q=M_g/M_h=0.59 were determined. Assuming
a massive white dwarf as the hot component, M_h= 1.2-1.4 M_{\odot}, the red
giant mass is M_g= 0.68-0.80 M_{\odot} and the orbit inclination, i =
49-52^{\circ}. The cF-type lines are not associated with either binary
component, and are most likely formed in the material streaming towards the hot
component. We also confirm the presence of the LiI doublet in RS Oph and its
radial velocities fit very well the M-giant radial velocity curve. Regardless
of the mechanism involved to produce lithium, its origin is most likely from
within the cool giant rather than material captured by the giant at the time of
the nova explosion. In April 2006 most of the emission lines present a broad
pedestal with a strong and narrow component at about -20 km/s and two other
extended emission components at -200 and +150 km/s. These components could
originate in a bipolar gas outflow supporting the model of a bipolar
shock-heated shell expanding through the cool component wind perpendicularly to

2007), observed by Swift between 1 and 422 days after outburst. Initially
bright only in the UV, V458 Vul became a variable hard X-ray source due to
optically thin thermal emission at kT=0.64 keV with an X-ray band unabsorbed
luminosity of 2.3x10^{34} erg s^{-1} during days 71-140. The X-ray spectrum at
this time requires a low Fe abundance (0.2^{+0.3}_{-0.1} solar), consistent
with a Suzaku measurement around the same time. On day 315 we find a new X-ray
spectral component which can be described by a blackbody with temperature of
kT=23^{+9}_{-5} eV, while the previous hard X-ray component has declined by a
factor of 3.8. The spectrum of this soft X-ray component resembles those
typically seen in the class of supersoft sources (SSS) which suggests that the
nova ejecta were starting to clear and/or that the WD photosphere is shrinking
to the point at which its thermal emission reaches into the X-ray band. We find
a high degree of variability in the soft component with a flare rising by an
order of magnitude in count rate in 0.2 days. In the following observations on
days 342.4-383.6, the soft component was not seen, only to emerge again on day
397. The hard component continued to evolve, and we found an anticorrelation
between the hard X-ray emission and the UV emission, yielding a Spearman rank
probability of 97%. After day 397, the hard component was still present, was
variable, and continued to fade at an extremely slow rate but could not be
analysed owing to pile up contamination from the bright SSS component.

of these sources is coincident with a background galaxy, which rules out the
possibility that the MACHO LMC microlensing sample is contaminated with
misidentified supernovae or AGN in galaxies behind the LMC. This supports the
conclusion that the MACHO LMC microlensing sample has only a small amount of
contamination due to non-microlensing forms of variability. We compare the
WFPC2 source star magnitudes with the lensed flux predictions derived from
microlensing fits to the light curve data. In most cases the source star
brightness is accurately predicted. Finally, we develop a statistic which
constrains the location of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) microlensing source
stars with respect to the distributions of stars and dust in the LMC and
compare this to the predictions of various models of LMC microlensing. This

excess LMC microlensing optical depth seen by MACHO with a population of
background sources are disfavored or excluded by this test. Models in which

physics ever. In recent times, it has been rephrased as the dark energy problem
in order to encompass a wider spectrum of possibilities. It is, in any case, a
polyhedric puzzle with many faces, including the cosmic coincidence problem,
i.e. why the density of matter is presently so close to the CC density.
However, the oldest, toughest and most intriguing face of this polyhedron is
the big CC problem, namely why the measured value of the CC at present is so
small as compared to any typical density scale existing in high energy physics,
especially taking into account the many phase transitions that our Universe has
undergone since the early times, including inflation. In this letter, we
propose to extend the field equations of General Relativity by including a
class of invariant terms that automatically relax the value of the CC
irrespective of the initial size of the vacuum energy in the early epochs. We
show that, at late times, the Universe enters an eternal de Sitter stage
mimicking a tiny positive cosmological constant. Thus, these models could solve
the big CC problem and have also a bearing on the cosmic coincidence problem.
Remarkably, they mimic the LCDM model to a large extent, but they still leave
some characteristic imprints that should be testable in the next generation of
experiments.

correlations by solving the many-body Schrodinger equation for several tens of
electrons interacting via the short-ranged pair interaction V(x - x'). We solve
this many-body problem by advanced configuration-interaction (CI) and diffusion
Monte Carlo (DMC) methods. Our CI and DMC results show, that the persistent
current (I) as a function of the ring length (L) exhibits for large L the power
law typical of the Luttinger liquid, $I \propto L^{-1-\alpha}$, where the power
$\alpha$ depends only on the electron-electron (e-e) interaction. For strong
e-e interaction the previous theories predicted for $\alpha$ the formula
$\alpha = {(1 + 2 \alpha_{RG})}^{1/2} - 1$, where $\alpha_{RG} =
[V(0)-V(2k_F)]/2\pi \hbar v_F$ is the renormalisation-group result for weakly
interacting electrons, with V(q) being the Fourier transform of V(x-x'). Our
numerical data show that this theoretical result holds in the continuous model
only if the range of V(x - x') is small (roughly $d \lesssim 1/2k_F$, more
precisely $4d^2k_F^2 << 1$). For strong e-e interaction ($\alpha_{RG} > 0.25$)
our CI data show the power law $I \propto L^{-1-\alpha}$ already for rings with
only ten electrons, i.e., ten electrons are already enough to behave like the
Luttinger liquid. The DMC data for $\alpha_{RG} > 0.25$ are damaged by the
so-called fixed-phase approximation. Finally, we also treat the e-e interaction
in the Hartree-Fock approximation. We find the exponentially decaying I(L)
instead of the power law, however, the slope of log(I(L)) still depends solely
on the parameter $\alpha_{RG}$ as long as the range of V(x - x') approaches
zero.

magnetic quadrupole transition form factors in chi_c2 -> J/psi gamma,
calculated for the first time in this framework, and study transitions
involving excited psi and chi_c1,2 states. We calculate hindered magnetic
dipole transition widths without the sensitivity to assumptions made in model

that only for the configurations with the same-numbered quantum dots
side-coupled to the quantum dots in the arms of the interferometer, some

the absence of magnetic flux all odd molecular states decouple from the leads,
but all even molecular states decouple from the leads when an appropriate
magnetic flux is introduced. Interestingly, the antiresonance position in the
electron transport spectrum is independent of the change of the decoupled
molecular states. In addition, when considering the many-body effect within the
second-order approximation, we show that the emergence of decoupling gives rise
to the apparent destruction of electron-hole symmetry. By adjusting the
magnetic flux through either subring, some molecular states decouple from one
lead but still couple to the other, and then some new antiresonances occur.

the statistical polarization signals from the population of clusters. Power

zones (like the solar tachocline) excite nonaxisymmetric r-modes which can be
observed. To this end the hydrodynamical stability of latitudinal differential
rotation is studied. The amount of rotational shear required for the
instability is estimated in dependence of the character of radial
stratification and the flow patterns excited by the instability are found. The
eigenvalue equations for the nonaxisymmetric disturbances are formulated in 3D
and then solved numerically. Radial displacements and entropy disturbances are
included. The equations contain the 2D approximation of strictly horizontal
displacements as a special limit. The critical magnitude of the latitudinal
differential rotation for onset of the instability is considerably reduced in
the 3D theory compared to the 2D approximation. The instability requires a
subadiabatic stratification. It does not exist in the bulk of convection zone
with almost adiabatic stratification but may switch on near its base in the
region of penetrative convection. Growth rates and symmetry types of the modes
are computed in dependence on the rotation law parameters. The S1 mode with its
transequatorial toroidal vortices is predicted as the dominating instability
mode. The vortices show longitudinal drift rates retrograde to the basic
rotation which are close to that of the observed weak r-mode signatures at the
solar surface.

transition from the initial ""free expansion"" phase to the adiabatic expansion

declining from an unexpectedly early maximum (compared with expectations from
observations of the 1985 outburst). The flux density recovered to a second peak
by approximately day 40, consistent with behaviour observed in 1985. At all
times the spectral index is consistent with mixed non-thermal and thermal
emission. The spectral indices are consistent with a non-thermal component at
lower frequencies on all dates, and the spectral index changes show that the

two-component model, consisting of a decelerating shell seen in mixed thermal

emission, as seen in contemporaneous VLBA observations. Our estimated ejecta
mass of 4+/-2x10^{-7} M_\odot is consistent with a WD mass of 1.4 M_\odot. It
may be that this ejecta mass estimate is a lower limit, in which case a lower
WD mass would be consistent with the data.

relativistic hadrons in the jets launched by the compact object can interact
with cold protons from the star's radiatively driven wind, producing pions that
then quickly decay into gamma rays. Since the resulting gamma-ray emissivity
depends on the target density, the detection of rapid variability in
microquasars with GLAST and the new generation of Cherenkov imaging arrays
could be used to probe the clumped structure of the stellar wind. We show here
that the fluctuation in gamma rays can be modeled using a ""porosity length""
formalism, usually applied to characterize clumping effects. In particular, for
a porosity length defined by h=l/f, i.e. as the ratio of the characteristic
size l of clumps to their volume filling factor f, we find that the relative
fluctuation in gamma-ray emission in a binary with orbital separation a scales
as sqrt(h/pi a) in the ""thin-jet"" limit, and is reduced by a factor 1/sqrt(1 +
phi a/(2 l)) for a jet with a finite opening angle phi. For a thin jet and
quite moderate porosity length h ~ 0.03 a, this implies a ca. 10 % variation in
the gamma-ray emission. Moreover, the illumination of individual large clumps
might result in isolated flares, as has been recently observed in some massive
gamma-ray binaries.

reliable calibration sources. We investigate how well these white dwarf spectra
can be used as standard candles at the lowest X-ray energies in order to gauge
the absolute effective area scale of X-ray instruments. We calculate a grid of
model atmospheres for Sirius B and HZ 43A, and adjust the parameters using
several constraints until the ratio of the spectra of both stars agrees with
the ratio as observed by the low energy transmission grating spectrometer
(LETGS) of Chandra. This ratio is independent of any errors in the effective
area of the LETGS. We find that we can constrain the absolute X-ray spectrum of
both stars with better than 5 % accuracy. The best-fit model for both stars is
close to a pure hydrogen atmosphere, and we put tight limits to the amount of
helium or the thickness of a hydrogen layer in both stars. Our upper limit to
the helium abundance in Sirius B is 4 times below the previous detection based
on EUVE data. We also find that our results are sensitive to the adopted
cut-off in the Lyman pseudo-continuum opacity in Sirius B. We get best
agreement with a long wavelength cut-off. White dwarf model atmospheres can be

partition of n, and obtain another partition by moving a node from one row to a
shorther row. Carter and Payne showed that if the p-residue of the removed and
added positions is the same, then there is a non-zero homomorphism between the
corresponding Specht modules for the symmetric group of degree n, defined over
a field of characteristic p. In this paper we give a very simple description of
such a homomorphism, as a map between polytabloids, using the action of a
Murphy-Jucys element.
  We also present a proof that in this context the homomorphism space is
1-dimensional. S. Lyle has already proved the more general result for
Iwahori-Hecke algebras. In the process we give a formula for the Carter-Payne
homomorphism as a linear combination of semi-standard homomorphisms. Our
methods allow us to compute a lower bound for where the image of this
homomorphism lies in the Jantzen filtration of the codomain Specht module.
  As an application, we show that the endomorphism ring of the restriction of a
Specht module to the symmetric group of degree n-1 is an explicit direct
product of truncated polynomial rings. A. Kleshchev proved the analogous result
for the restriction of irreducible modules.

granulation to supergranulation are still not understood, nor are their
interaction with magnetic fields. We thus aim at giving a better description of
dynamics in the mesoscale range which lies between the two scales mentioned
above. Method: We analyse a 48h high-resolution time sequence of the quiet Sun
photosphere at the disk center obtained with the Solar Optical Telescope
onboard Hinode. The observations, which have a field of view of 100
\arcsec$\times$ 100 \arcsec, typically contain four supergranules. We monitor
in detail the motion and evolution of granules as well as those of the radial
magnetic field. Results: This analysis allows us to better characterize Trees
of Fragmenting Granules issued from repeated fragmentation of granules,
especially their lifetime statistics. Using floating corks advected by measured
velocity fields, we show their crucial role in the advection of the magnetic
field and in the build up of the network. Finally, thanks to the long duration
of the time series, we estimate that the turbulent diffusion coefficient
induced by horizontal motion is approximately $430 \mathrm{km}^2
\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that the long living
families contribute to the formation of the magnetic network and suggest that
supergranulation could be an emergent length scale building up as small
magnetic elements are advected and concentrated by TFG flows. Our estimate for
the magnetic diffusion associated with this horizontal motion might provide a
useful input for mean-field dynamo models.

isolate a component of emission with a width of 680 km/s (FWHM) that arises
from an ""intermediate line region"" (ILR), similar to the one we discovered in
NGC 4151, at a distance of ~1 pc from the central continuum source. From a
detailed analysis of the five intrinsic absorption components in NGC 5548 and
their behavior over a span of 8 years, we present evidence that most of the UV
absorbers only partially cover the ILR and do not cover an extended region of
UV continuum emission, most likely from hot stars in the circumnuclear region.
We also find that four of the UV absorbers are at much greater distances (>70
pc) than the ILR, and none have sufficient N V or C IV column densities to be
the ILR in absorption. At least a portion of the UV absorption component 3, at
a radial velocity of -530 km/s, is likely responsible for most of the X-ray
absorption, at a distance < 7 pc from the central source. The fact that we see
the ILR in absorption in NGC 4151 and not in NGC 5548 suggests that the ILR is
located at a relatively large polar angle (~45 degrees) with respect to the

scientists with a view towards pure mathematics (D. Eisenbud,...) or
applications to control theory (U. Oberst,...).However, a carefull examination
of the quotations clearly shows that people have hardly been looking at the
last chapter dealing with the so-called ""inverse systems"", unless in very
particular situations. The purpose of this paper is to provide for the first
time the full explanation of this chapter within the framework of the formal
theory of systems of partial differential equations (Spencer operator on
sections, involution,...) and its algebraic counterpart now called ""algebraic
analysis"" (commutative and homological algebra, differential modules,...). Many
explicit examples are fully treated and hints are given towards the way to work
out computer algebra packages.

kiloparsec-sized region around the Sun, based on ~ 2 million M-type stars from

combining SDSS positions with the USNO-B catalogue. We estimate photometric
distances to all stars, accurate to ~ 20 %, and combine them with the proper
motions to derive tangential velocities for this kinematically unbiased sample
of stars. Based on a statistical de-projection method we then derive the
vertical profiles (to heights of Z = 800 pc above the disk plane) for the first
and second moments of the three dimensional stellar velocity distribution. We
find that <W> = -7 +/- 1 km/s and <U> = -9 +/- 1 km/s, independent of height
above the mid-plane, reflecting the Sun's motion with respect to the local
standard of rest. In contrast, <V> changes distinctly from -20 +/- 2 km/s in
the mid-plane to <V> = -32 km/s at Z = 800 pc, reflecting an asymmetric drift
of the stellar mean velocity that increases with height. All three components
of the M-star velocity dispersion show a strong linear rise away from the
mid-plane, most notably \sigma_{ZZ}, which grows from 18 km/s (Z = 0) to 40
km/s (at Z = 800 pc). We determine the orientation of the velocity ellipsoid,
and find a significant vertex deviation of 20 to 25 degrees, which decreases
only slightly to heights of Z = 800 pc. Away from the mid-plane, our sample
exhibits a remarkably large tilt of the velocity ellipsoid towards the Galactic
plane, which reaches 20 deg. at Z = 800 pc and which is not easily explained.
Finally, we determine the ratio \sigma^2_{\phi\phi}/\sigma^2_{RR} near the
mid-plane, which in the epicyclic approximation implies an almost perfectly
flat rotation curve at the Solar radius.

(adaptive optics or tip-tilt mirror) so that atmospheric turbulence alone
defines the image quality, and thus the coronagraphic performances. Moreover,
the experiment could not run under optimal operational conditions due to
hardware/software problems. Satisfactory results have been obtained: broad band
total rejection exceeding 15 were attained in the visible. This first day-time
observation campaign yields an experimental feedback on how to improve the
