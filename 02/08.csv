involves contacting it with metal electrodes. We study the adsorption of
graphene on metal substrates using first-principles calculations at the level
of density functional theory. The bonding of graphene to Al, Ag, Cu, Au and
Pt(111) surfaces is so weak that its unique ""ultrarelativistic"" electronic
structure is preserved. The interaction does, however, lead to a charge
transfer that shifts the Fermi level by up to 0.5 eV with respect to the
conical points. The crossover from p-type to n-type doping occurs for a metal
with a work function ~5.4 eV, a value much larger than the work function of
free-standing graphene, 4.5 eV. We develop a simple analytical model that
describes the Fermi level shift in graphene in terms of the metal substrate
work function. Graphene interacts with and binds more strongly to Co, Ni, Pd
and Ti. This chemisorption involves hybridization between graphene $p_z$-states
and metal d-states that opens a band gap in graphene. The graphene work
function is as a result reduced considerably. In a current-in-plane device
geometry this should lead to n-type doping of graphene.

Consider an elastic continuum in 3-dimensional Euclidean space and assume that
points of this continuum can experience no displacements, only rotations. This
framework is a special case of the so-called Cosserat theory of elasticity.
Rotations of points of the continuum are described by attaching to each point
an orthonormal basis which gives a field of orthonormal bases called the
coframe. As the dynamical variables (unknowns) of our theory we choose a
coframe and a density. We write down a potential energy which is conformally
invariant and then incorporate time in the standard Newtonian way, by
subtracting kinetic energy. Finally, we rewrite the resulting nonlinear
variational problem in terms of an unknown spinor field. We look for
quasi-stationary solutions, i.e. solutions that harmonically oscillate in time.
We prove that in the quasi-stationary setting our model is equivalent to a pair
of massless Dirac equations. The crucial element of the proof is the
observation that our Lagrangian admits a factorisation.

conservation of gravitational energy-momentum dates to the 1910s. A suitably
covariant infinite-component localization is displayed, reflecting Bergmann's
realization that there are infinitely many conserved gravitational
energy-momenta. Initially use is made of a flat background metric (or rather,
all of them) or connection, because the desired gauge invariance properties are
obvious. Partial gauge-fixing then yields an appropriate covariant quantity
without any background metric or connection; one version is the collection of
pseudotensors of a given type, such as the Einstein pseudotensor, in_every_
coordinate system. This solution to the gauge covariance problem is easily
adapted to any pseudotensorial expression (Landau-Lifshitz, Goldberg,
Papapetrou or the like) or to any tensorial expression built with a background
metric or connection. Thus the specific functional form can be chosen on
technical grounds such as relating to Noether's theorem and yielding expected
values of conserved quantities in certain contexts and then rendered covariant
using the procedure described here. The application to angular momentum
localization is straightforward. Traditional objections to pseudotensors are
based largely on the false assumption that there is only one gravitational
energy rather than infinitely many.

sources using low-resolution (R~1000) near-infrared K- and L-band spectroscopy.
We measure prominent spectral lines and features in 8 objects and use fits to
standard star spectra to determine spectral types, visual extinctions, K-band
excesses, and water ice optical depths. Four of the seven systems studied are
close binary pairs; only one of these systems, Haro 6-10, was angularly
resolvab le. For certain stars some properties found in our analysis differ
substantially from published values; we analyze the origin of these
differences. We determine extinction to each source using three different
methods and compare and discuss the resulting values. One hypothesis that we
were testing, that extinction dominates over the K-band excess in obscuration
of the stellar photospheric absorption lines, appears not to be true. Accretion
luminosities and mass accretion rates calculated for our targets are highly
uncertain, in part the result of our inexact knowledge of extinction. For the
six targets we were able to place on an H-R diagram, our age estimates, <2 Myr,
are somewhat younger than those from comparable studies. Our results underscore
the value of low-resolution spectroscopy in the study of protostars and their
environments; however, the optimal approach to the study of Class I sources
likely involves a combination of high- and low-resolution near-infrared,
mid-infrared, and millimeter wavelength observations. Accurate and precise
measurements of extinction in Class I protostars will be key to improving our
understanding of these objects.

one third of beta Cephei stars have detected magnetic fields: Out of 13 beta
Cephei stars studied to date with FORS1, four stars possess weak magnetic
fields, and out of the sample of six suspected beta Cephei stars two show a
weak magnetic field. The fraction of magnetic SPBs and candidate SPBs is found

somewhat similar trend is found if we consider a correlation between the field
strength and the v sin i-values, i.e. stronger magnetic fields tend to be found
in more slowly rotating stars.

X-ray source, and emission measure (density square times volume), of the
massive binary system Eta Carinae to determine the orientation of its
semi-major axis. The source of the hard X-ray emission is the shocked secondary
wind. We argue that, by itself, the observed X-ray flux cannot teach us much
about the orientation of the semi-major axis. Minor adjustment of some unknown
parameters of the binary system allows to fit the X-ray light curve with almost
any inclination angle and orientation. The column density and X-ray emission
measure, on the other hand, impose strong constrains on the orientation. We
improve our previous calculations and show that the column density is more
compatible with an orientation where for most of the time the secondary - the
hotter, less massive star - is behind the primary star. The secondary comes
closer to the observer only for a short time near periastron passage. The
ten-week X-ray deep minimum, which results from a large decrease in the
emission measure, implies that the regular secondary wind is substantially
suppressed during that period. This suppression is most likely resulted by
accretion of mass from the dense wind of the primary luminous blue variable
(LBV) star. The accretion from the equatorial plane might lead to the formation
of a polar outflow. We suggest that the polar outflow contributes to the soft
X-ray emission during the X-ray minimum; the other source is the shocked
secondary wind in the tail. The conclusion that accretion occurs at each
periastron passage, every five and a half years, implies that accretion had
occurred at a much higher rate during the 20 Great Eruption of Eta Carinae in
the 19th century.
