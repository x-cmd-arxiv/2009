under a U(1)_d dark gauge symmetry. Kinetic mixing between U(1)_d and
hypercharge generates the appropriate hierarchy of scales needed to explain
PAMELA and ATIC with a GeV scale force carrier and DAMA (or INTEGRAL) using the
proposals of inelastic (or, respectively, exciting) dark matter. Because of the
extreme simplicity of this setup, observational constraints lead to unambiguous
determination of the model parameters. In particular, the DAMA scattering cross
section is directly related to the size of the hypercharge D-term vacuum
expectation value. The known relic abundance of DM can be used to fix the ratio
of the dark sector coupling to the dark matter mass. Finally, the recent
observation of cosmic ray positron and electron excesses can be used to fix the
mass of the dark matter through the observation of a shoulder in the spectrum
and the size of the kinetic mixing by fitting to the rate. These parameters can
be used to make further predictions, which can be checked at future direct
detection, indirect detection, as well as collider experiments.

explanation to the set of experimental and observational anomalies with
possible connections to Dark Matter (DM). A central role is played by GeV scale
""dark"" gauge bosons exchanged by the weak scale DM. Motivated by this proposal,
we build an explicit model of DM in the context of Weak Scale Supersymmetry
(SUSY). We employ high-scale SUSY-breaking and invoke the Giudice-Masiero
mechanism to generate the weak scale DM masses. By sequestering the dark sector
from the SUSY-breaking ""hidden"" sector, it naturally acquires GeV scale soft
masses that help generate the dark gauge boson mass. The visible MSSM sector is
not fully sequestered and acquires gaugino-mediated soft terms at the weak
scale. This hierarchy of scales naturally leads to the Sommerfeld enhancement
of DM annihilations needed to account for the electron/positron excesses in the
PAMELA and ATIC experiments. The possibility of co-existing species of DM is
used to show how the INTEGRAL and DAMA anomalies can both be explained. We
study the cosmological constraints on the new stable or long-lived light
particles that appear in our models. We discuss the lepton-jet collider signals

interplay of the soft and hard dilatons plays a subtle role in how chiral
symmetry is manifested in hot and/or dense matter. The scale anomaly in which
the soft component intervenes vanishes at the chiral transition in a way
analogous to the restoration of scale symmetry in the Freund-Nambu model, while
that of the hard component remains broken throughout the QCD sector. Most
remarkable of all is its role in the chiral anomaly sector through a

the Poincare space from other well-proportioned spaces? The residual
acceleration effect in the Poincare space is studied here using a massive
particle and a nearby test particle of negligible mass, in S^3 embedded in R^4.
The weak limit gravitational attraction on a test particle at distance r is set
\propto [r_C \sin(r/r_C)]^{-2}, where r_C = curvature radius, in order to
satisfy Stokes' theorem. A finite particle horizon large enough to include the
adjacent topological images of the massive particle is assumed. The regular,
flat, 3-torus T^3 is re-examined, and two other well-proportioned spaces,
S^3/T^* and S^3/O^*, are also studied. The residual gravity effect occurs in
all four cases. In a perfectly regular 3-torus of side length L_a, and in
S^3/T^* and S^3/O^*, the highest order term in the residual acceleration is the
third order term in the Taylor expansion of r/L_a (3-torus), or r/r_C,
respectively. However, the Poincare dodecahedral space is unique among the four
spaces. The third order cancels, leaving the fifth order term \sim \pm 300
(r/r_C)^5 as the most significant. Not only are three of the four perfectly
regular well-proportioned spaces better balanced than most other multiply
connected spaces in terms of the residual acceleration effect by a factor of
about a million (setting r/L_a = r/r_C \sim 10^{-3}), but the fourth of these
spaces is about 10^4 times better balanced than the other three. This is the
Poincare dodecahedral space. Is this unique dynamical property of the Poincare

two atomic quantum dots embedded in the barriers between the condensates. Each

described as a two-state system, or a pseudospin 1/2. Although there is no
direct coupling between the dots, an effective interaction between the
pseudospins is induced due to their coupling to the condensate reservoirs. We
investigate this effective interaction, depending on the strengths of the
dot-condensate coupling T and the direct coupling J between the condensates. In
particular, we show that an initially ferromagnetic arrangement of the two
pseudospins stays intact even for large T/J. However, antiferromagnetically
aligned spins undergo peculiar ""breathing"" modes for weak coupling T/J<1, while
for strong coupling the behaviour of the spins becomes uncorrelated.

here that simple geometry leads to a net transfer of electrons from larger to

was theoretically investigated on basis of a biophysical model. In accordance
with the prevailing model of LD formation, we assumed that neutral lipids
oil-out between the membrane leaflets of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),
resulting in LD that bud-off when a critical size is reached.
  Mathematically, LD were modeled as spherical protuberances in an otherwise
planar ER membrane. We estimated the local phospholipid composition, and
calculated the change in elastic free energy of the membrane caused by nascent
LD. Based on this model calculation, we found a gradual demixing of lipids in
the membrane leaflet that goes along with an increase in surface curvature at
the site of LD formation. During demixing, the phospholipid monolayer was able
to gain energy during LD growth, which suggested that the formation of curved
interfaces was supported by or even driven by lipid demixing. In addition, we
show that demixing is thermodynamically necessary as LD cannot bud-off
otherwise.
  In the case of Saccharomyces cerevisiae our model predicts a LD bud-off
diameter of about 13 nm. This diameter is far below the experimentally
determined size of typical yeast LD. Thus, we concluded that if the standard
model of LD formation is valid, LD biogenesis is a two step process. Small LD
are produced from the ER, which subsequently ripe within the cytosol through a
series of fusions.

First, there is no supervisor in the brain who controls these processes. Second
there is a hugh number of neurons (10^{6} to 10^{10}) involved in those
cognitive tasks. For this reason, the search of understanding cognitive
processes uses models built from a large number of neurons, but very much
simplified neurons. The so-called neural networks have been quite successful in
describing certain aspects of brain functions, like the mechanism of
associative memory or recently the prediction of epileptic seizures. At hand of
the Kohonen network we discuss the treatment of information in the brain, in
particular how the brain organizes such information without supervisor.
Recently, networks of small-world and scale-free architecture came into focus.
There is evidence indicating that the brain (cat cortex, macaque cortex, human
brain) uses such connectivity architecture. Tasks like treatment of

small-world connectivity and thus play a potentially important role in
self-organization of the brain.

relations between the geometric properties of tilings and the algebraic
properties of associated relational structures. Our study is motivated by the
existence of aperiodic tiling systems. In [7], we considered tilings of the
euclidean spaces of finite dimension, and isomorphism was defined up to
translation. Here, we consider, more generally, tilings of a metric space, and
isomorphism is defined modulo an arbitrary group of isometries.
  In Section 1, we define the relational structures associated to tilings. The
results of Section 2 concern local isomorphism, the extraction preorder and the
characterization of relational structures which can be represented by tilings
of some given type.
  In Section 3, we show that the notions of periodicity and invariance through
a translation, defined for tilings of the euclidean spaces of finite dimension,
can be generalized, with appropriate hypotheses, to relational structures, and
in particular to tilings of noneuclidean spaces.
  The results of Section 4 are valid for uniformly locally finite relational
structures, and in particular tilings, which satisfy the local isomorphism
property. We characterize among such structures those which are locally
isomorphic to structures without nontrivial automorphism. We show that, in an
euclidean space of finite dimension, this property is true for a tiling which
satisfies the local isomorphism property if and only if it is not invariant
through a nontrivial translation. We illustrate these results with examples,
some of them concerning aperiodic tilings systems of euclidean or noneuclidean
spaces.

distributions, discrepancy distance, that is tailored to adaptation problems
with arbitrary loss functions. We give Rademacher complexity bounds for
estimating the discrepancy distance from finite samples for different loss
functions. Using this distance, we derive novel generalization bounds for
domain adaptation for a wide family of loss functions. We also present a series
of novel adaptation bounds for large classes of regularization-based
algorithms, including support vector machines and kernel ridge regression based
on the empirical discrepancy. This motivates our analysis of the problem of
minimizing the empirical discrepancy for various loss functions for which we
also give novel algorithms. We report the results of preliminary experiments
that demonstrate the benefits of our discrepancy minimization algorithms for

consistent way, showing that the CKM matrix is the dominant source of flavour
mixing and CP-violation and that New Physics (NP) effects can appear at most as
small corrections to the CKM picture. Generalizing the UT analysis to
investigate NP effects, constraints on b -> s transitions are also included and
both CKM and NP parameters are fitted simultaneously. While no evidence of NP
effects is found in K-\bar K and B_d-\bar B_d mixing, in the B_s-\bar B_s
mixing an hint of NP is found at the 2.9 \sigma level. The UT analysis beyond
the SM also allows us to derive bounds on the coefficients of the most general
\Delta F=2 effective Hamiltonian, that can be translated into bounds on the NP

hierarchical clustering scenario, are at odds with the properties inferred from
the observations at galactic scales. My Thesis addresses this problem by taking
an evolutionary approach. I analysed in detail the many and different
observational evidences of a discrepancy the predicted halo equilibrium state
and the one inferred from the measurable properties of disk galaxies, as well
as of the scaling relations existing between the angular momentum, geometry and
mass distribution of the luminous and dark components, and realized that they
all seem to point towards the same conclusion: the baryons hosted inside the
halo, by collapsing and assembling to form the galaxy, perturb the halo
equilibrium structure and made it evolve into new configurations. From the
theoretical point of view, the behaviour of dark matter halos as collisionless
systems of particles makes their equilibrium structure and mass distribution
extremely sensitive to perturbations of their inner dynamics. The galaxy
formation occurring inside the halos is a tremendous event, and the dynamical
coupling between the baryons and the dark matter during the protogalaxy
collapse represents a perturbation of the halo dynamical structure large enough
to trigger a halo evolution, according to the relative mass and angular
momentum of the two components. My conclusion is that the structure and
dynamics of dark matter halos, as well as the origin of the connection between
the halo and galaxy properties, are to be understood in in terms of a joint
evolution of the baryonic and dark components, originating at the epoch of the
collapse and formation of the galaxy.

distribution of the bosons in the Mott phase for an infinite homogeneous
periodic system at zero temperature through third-order in the hopping. By
using scaling theory for the critical behavior at zero momentum and at the
critical value of the hopping for the Mott insulator to superfluid transition
along with a generalization of the RPA-like form for the momentum distribution,
we are able to extrapolate the series to infinite order and produce very
accurate quantitative results for the momentum distribution in a simple
functional form for one, two, and three dimensions; the accuracy is better in
higher dimensions and is on the order of a few percent relative error
everywhere except close to the critical value of the hopping divided by the
on-site repulsion. In addition, we find simple phenomenological expressions for
the Mott phase lobes in two and three dimensions which are much more accurate
than the truncated strong-coupling expansions and any other analytic
approximation we are aware of. The strong-coupling expansions and scaling
theory results are benchmarked against numerically exact QMC simulations in two

analytic expressions will be useful for quick comparison of experimental
results to theory and in many cases can bypass the need for expensive numerical

Andreev-reflection experiments performed on LaFeAsO1-xFx (La-1111) polycrystals
with Tc ~ 27 K and SmFeAsO0.8F0.2 (Sm-1111) ones with Tc ~ 53 K gave
differential conductance curves exhibiting two peaks at low bias and two
additional structures (peaks or shoulders) at higher bias, an experimental
situation quite similar to that observed by the same technique in pure and
doped MgB2. The single-band Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk model is totally unable to
properly fit the conductance curves, while the two-gap one accounts remarkably
well for the shape of the whole experimental dI/dV vs. V curves. These results
give direct evidence of two nodeless gaps in the superconducting state of
ReFeAsO1-xFx (Re = La, Sm): a small gap, Delta1, smaller than the BCS value
(2Delta1/kBTc ~ 2.2 - 3.2) and a much larger gap Delta2 which gives a ratio
2Delta2/kBTc ~ 6.5 - 9. In Sm-1111 both gaps close at the same temperature,
very similar to the bulk Tc, and follow a BCS-like behaviour, while in La-1111
the situation is more complex, the temperature dependence of the gaps showing
remarkable deviations from the BCS behaviour at T close to Tc. The normal-state
conductance reproducibly shows an unusual, but different, shape in La-1111 and
Sm-1111 with a depression or a hump at zero bias, respectively. These
structures survive up to T* ~ 140 K, close to the temperatures at which
structural and magnetic transitions occur in the parent, undoped compound.

Determining the number of red dwarfs with planets and assessing planetary

important because such studies would indicate how common life is in the
universe. Our program - ""Living with a Red Dwarf"" - addresses these questions
by investigating the long-term nuclear evolution and the coronal and

properties of a sample of dM0--5 stars. Observations carried out by FUSE of a

transition region heating in these stars with deep convective zones as well as
providing measures of FUV irradiances. Also studied are the effects of
X-ray--FUV emissions on possible hosted planets and impacts of this radiation

planetary atmospheres and possible life on planetary surfaces. The initial

bright, nearby Classical Cepheids from analyses of FUSE archival observations
and one of our own approved observations just prior to the failure of the
satellite. Polaris and beta Dor are currently the only two Cepheids to have
been observed with FUSE, and beta Dor is the only one to have multiple spectra.
Both Cepheids show strong C III (977A, 1176A) and O VI (1032A, 1038A)
emissions, indicative of 50,000-500,000 K plasma, well above the photospheric
temperatures of the stars. More remarkably, beta Dor displays variability in
the FUV emission strengths which appears to be correlated to its 9.84-d
pulsation period. This phenomenon has never before been observed in Cepheids.
The FUV studies are presented along with our recent Chandra/XMM X-ray
observations of Polaris and beta Dor, in which X-ray detections were found for
both stars (as well as for the prototype Classical Cepheid, delta Cep). Further
X-ray observations have been proposed to unambiguously determine the origin and
nature of the observed high energy emissions from the targets, possibly arising
from warm winds, shocks, or pulsationally induced magnetic activity. The
initial results of this study are discussed.

kagome lattice structure in part of its phase diagram. As a function of Zn
doping, this material undergoes a structural distortion which relieves the
frustration and introduces magnetic order in the ground state, though the
precise nature of the order is not clear at this point. In this paper, we
present strong evidence for Neel ordering in the strongly distorted phase of
Zn-Paratacamite through the application of quantum Monte-Carlo techniques.
These numerical results support a recent Schwinger-boson mean field theory of
Zn-Paratacamite. For weak distortion, close to the ideal kagome limit, our
results indicate a regime with no Neel order but with a broken glide-plane
symmetry. For this model the glide-plane symmetry is broken by any valence bond
crystal. Hence, our results lend support to recent proposals of a valence bond
crystal ground state for the undistorted lattice. The phase transition between
the two phases could be in the deconfined universality class if it is not a
first order transition.

model and compare with low-z observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey

decrease in scatter at the bright end. These characteristics are predicted by
our model, based on merger trees from a semi-analytic model of galaxy
formation. We assume galaxies move onto a ""creation red sequence"" when they
undergo major gas-rich mergers. Subsequent dry mergers move galaxies along the
relation by increasing their mass, but also make them slightly bluer. This
occurs because bright galaxies are most likely to merge with one of the more
numerous fainter and consequently bluer galaxies that lie further down the
relation. Bright galaxies undergo a higher fraction of dry mergers than faint
galaxies, which causes a change in the slope of the CMR. A more realistic model
that includes scatter in the initial relation shows that dry merging causes a
tightening of the CMR towards the bright end. The small scatter in the observed
CMR thus cannot be used to argue against significant mass growth from dry
merging.

prepared the way so that the next decade can be the one in which we finally

only what the progenitors are that produce the GRBs, but also how the enormous
luminosity of the GRBs, concentrated in gamma rays, is achieved. Observations
across the electromagnetic spectrum, from both the ground and space, will be
required to fully tackle this important question. This white paper, mostly
distilled from a recent study commissioned by the Division of Astrophysics of
the American Physical Society, focuses on what very high energy (~100 GeV and

the most extreme high energy particle populations in the burst environment,
testing models of lepton and proton acceleration in GRBs and constraining the
bulk Lorentz factor and opacity of the outflow. Sensitivity improvements of

triangle functions, only correspond to certain values of $\alpha, \beta,
\gamma$. The solutions are then systematically constructed. These analytic
solutions provide all known and one new parametrization of the Eisenstein

plasma astrophysics in the studies of formation, evolution of, and feedback by
Active Galaxies. We make three specific recommendations: 1) We need to
significantly increase the resolution of VLA, perhaps by building an EVLA-II at
a modest cost. This will provide the angular resolution to study jets at kpc
scales, where, for example, detailed Faraday rotation diagnosis can be done at
1GHz transverse to jets; 2) We need to build coordinated programs among NSF,
NASA, and DOE to support laboratory plasma experiments (including liquid metal)
that are designed to study key astrophysical processes, such as
magneto-rotational instability (origin of angular momentum transport), dynamo
(origin of magnetic fields), jet launching and stability. Experiments allowing
access to relativistic plasma regime (perhaps by intense lasers and magnetic
fields) will be very helpful for understanding the stability and dissipation
physics of jets from Supermassive Black Holes; 3) Again through the coordinated
support among the three Agencies, we need to invest in developing comprehensive
theory and advanced simulation tools to study the accretion disks and jets in
relativistic plasma physics regime, especially in connecting large scale fluid
scale phenomena with relativistic kinetic dissipation physics through which
multi-wavelength radiation is produced.

revenue from the sale of a single product. We propose a model in which the
decision of a buyer to buy the product is influenced by friends that own the
product and the price at which the product is offered. The influence model we
analyze is quite general, naturally extending both the Linear Threshold model
and the Independent Cascade model, while also incorporating price information.
We consider sales proceeding in a cascading manner through the network, i.e. a
buyer is offered the product via recommendations from its neighbors who own the
product. In this setting, the seller influences events by offering a cashback
to recommenders and by setting prices (via coupons or discounts) for each buyer
in the social network.
  Finding a seller strategy which maximizes the expected revenue in this
setting turns out to be NP-hard. However, we propose a seller strategy that
generates revenue guaranteed to be within a constant factor of the optimal
strategy in a wide variety of models. The strategy is based on an
influence-and-exploit idea, and it consists of finding the right trade-off at
each time step between: generating revenue from the current user versus
offering the product for free and using the influence generated from this sale
later in the process. We also show how local search can be used to improve the
performance of this technique in practice.

stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binaries have been measured via two
techniques: fitting the X-ray continuum spectrum and modeling the profile of
the Fe K line. This fledgling enterprise motivates the following decadal goals:
(1) Firmly establish the continuum-fitting and Fe K methods; obtain precise
values of spin for 10-20 black holes, several using both methods; (2) use the
derived masses and spins to test models of jets, GRBs, supernovae, black hole
formation, black hole binary evolution, etc.; (3) serve the IXO mission by
securing the Fe K methodology, which is currently the only means to measure the
spins of supermassive black holes in AGN; (4) identify the correct model of
high-frequency QPOs, thereby opening a third channel for measuring spin; (5)
pursue X-ray polarimetry as a means of securing the continuum-fitting and Fe K
methods, and also as a possible fourth avenue to spin; and (6) develop and test
MHD models of thin disks in strong gravity. Achieving these goals requires the
establishment of an RXTE follow-on mission dedicated to the study of bright and
transient compact objects, as well as strong support for theoretical work on 3D
MHD simulations of accretion flows in the Kerr metric of a spinning black hole.

currently popular consensus that it is the orientation of the circumnuclear
obscuring torus which determines whether absorption is present along our
sight-line. The fact that at logL > 23 W/Hz, both type-1 and type-2 objects
exhibit a 50% probability of detection, suggests that this is not the case and
that the bias against detection of HI absorption in type-1 objects is due
purely to the inclusion of the logL > 23 W/Hz sources. Similarly, the
ultra-violet luminosities can also explain why the presence of 21-cm absorption
shows a preference for radio galaxies over quasars and the higher detection
rate in compact sources, such as CSS or GPS sources, may also be biased by the
inclusion of high-luminosity sources. Being comprised of all 21-cm searched
sources at z>0.1, this is a necessarily heterogeneous sample, the constituents
of which have been observed by various instruments. By this same token,
however, the dependence on the UV luminosity may be an all encompassing effect,
superseding the unified schemes model, although there is the possibility that
the exclusive 21-cm non-detections at high UV luminosities could be caused by a
bias towards gas-poor ellipticals. Additionally, the high UV fluxes could be
sufficiently exciting/ionising the HI above 21-cm detection thresholds,
although the extent to which this is related to the neutral gas deficit in
ellipticals is currently unclear.

Thomas-Fermi approximation to electron density. This new result enables us to
calculate the details of the self-consistent ion cores, as well as the
ionization potentials for the first s-orbital bound to the closed-shell ion
core of the Group III, IV and V elements. Next, we demonstrate a method for
separating core electron densities from valence electron densities. When we
calculate the valence kinetic energy density, we show that it separates into
two terms: the first exactly cancels the potential energy of the ion core in
the core region; the second represents the residual kinetic energy density
resulting from the valence density alone. Furthermore, we show that the kinetic
cancellation and the residual kinetic energy can be derived from a slowly
varying envelope approximation for the valence orbitals in the core region.
This kinetic cancellation in the core region and the residual valence kinetic
energy term allow us to write a functional for the total valence energy
dependant only on a low spatial frequency valence density. In the limit, when
we can freeze the potential of the closed-shell ion cores, assuming that they
are not greatly influenced by the readjustment of the valence electrons, we can
minimize the total valence energy with respect to the valence density degrees
of freedom. The variation of the valence total energy equation provides the
starting point for a large number of atomic, molecular and solid-state
electronic structure problems. Here, we use it to calculate the band structures
resulting from the self-consistent valence density and potential on the
zinc-blende and diamond lattices. We give band structure results for most of

unexplained flattening of the B_c2(T) curves reported for at least three other
disordered closely related systems as also as a manifestation of PLB. Their
Maki parameters have been estimated analyzing their B_c2(T) data within the WHH
approach. The pronounced PLB of (Ba,K)Fe_2As_2 single crystals from a tin-flux
is attributed also to a significant As deficiency. Consequences of our results
are discussed in terms of disorder effects within conventional (CSC) and
unconventional superconductivity (USC). USC scenarios with nodes on individual
Fermi surface sheets (FSS), can be discarded for our samples. The increase of
dB_c2/dT|_{T_c} by sizeable disorder provides evidence for an important
intraband (intra-FSS) contribution to the orbital upper critical field. We
suggest that it can be ascribed either to an impurity driven transition from
s_{+-} USC to CSC of an extended s_{++}-wave state or to a stabilized
s_{+-}-state provided As-vacancies cause predominantly strong intraband
scattering in the unitary limit. We compare our results with B_c2 data from the
literature with no PLB for fields below 60 to 70 Tesla probed so far. A novel
disorder related scenario of a complex interplay of SC with two different
competing magnetic instabilities is suggested.

nebulae (PNs). This paper is a follow-up to our previous study of CFW models
for the well-studied PPN CRL 618. Previously, we compared our CFW models with
optical observations of CRL 618 in atomic and ionic lines and found that a CFW
with a small opening angle can readily reproduce the highly collimated shape of
the northwestern (W1) lobe of CRL 618 and the bow-like structure seen at its
tip. In this paper, we compare our CFW models with recent observations of CRL
618 in CO J=2-1, J=6-5, and H2 1-0 S(1). In our models, limb-brightened shell
structures are seen in CO and H2 at low velocity arising from the shocked AGB
wind in the shell, and can be identified as the low-velocity (LV) components in
the observations. However, the shell structure in CO J=2-1 is significantly
less extended than that seen in the observations. None of our models can
properly reproduce the observed high-velocity (HV) molecular emission near the
source along the body of the lobe. In order to reproduce the HV molecular
emission in CRL 618, the CFW is required to have a different structure. One
possible CFW structure is the cylindrical jet, with the fast wind material
confined to a small cross section and collimated to the same direction along
the outflow axis.

cases that monotonously decay as a single power law (SPL) with an index of 1 ~
1.7 from tens (or hundreds) to ~ 10^5 seconds post the GRB trigger, apparently
different from the canonical lightcurves characterized by a shallow-to-normal
decay transition. No statistical difference is found in their prompt
gamma-rays, and the X-ray properties of the two samples are also similar,
although the SPL sample tend to have a slightly lower NH value of the host
galaxies and larger energy release compared with the canonical sample. The SPL
XRT lightcurves in the burst frame gradually merge into a conflux.The normal
decay segment for the canonical sample has the same feature. Similar to the
normal decay segment, the SPL lightcurves satisfy the closure relations of
external shock models. If the X-rays are the afterglow of the GRB fireball, our
results indicate that the shallow decay would be due to energy injection and
the total energy budget after injection for both samples of GRBs is comparable.
More intriguing, we find that a prior X-ray emission model proposed by Yamazaki
is more straightforward to interpret the data. We show that the zero times (T0)
of the X-rays atisfy a log-normal distribution, and the negligible T0's of the
SPL sample are consistent with being the tail of T0 distributions at low end.
Referenced to T0, the canonical XRT lightcurves well trace the SPL lightcurves.
The T0's of the canonical lightcurves in our analysis are usually much larger
than the offsets of the known precursors from the main GRBs, indicating the
X-rays would be an emission component from external shocks prior to GRB
trigger. The lack of detection of a jet-like break in most XRT lightcurves
implies that the opening angle of its jet would be usually large.

energy-momentum tensor originating from pseudomatter and partially compensating
for quantum jumps of the matter energy-momentum tensor. The compensation
ensures the continuity of metric and of its first time derivative. Pseudomatter
is actualized as pseudodust and perceived as a dark matter. The necessity of

a two-phase SPH technique. Mass transfer is important in the evolution of close
binaries, and a key issue is to determine the separation at which mass transfer
begins. The circular case is well understood and can be treated through the use
of the Roche formalism. To treat the eccentric case we use a newly-developed
two phase system. The body of the donor star is made up from high-mass ""water""
particles, whilst the atmosphere is modelled with low-mass ""oil"" particles.
Both sets of particles take part fully in SPH interactions. To test the
technique we model circular mass-transfer binaries containing a 0.6 Msun donor
star and a 1 Msun white dwarf; such binaries are thought to form cataclysmic
variable (CV) systems. We find that we can reproduce a reasonable CV
mass-transfer rate, and that our extended atmosphere gives a separation that is
too large by aproximately 16%, although its pressure scale height is
considerably exaggerated. We use the technique to measure the semi-major axis
required for the onset of mass transfer in binaries with a mass ratio of q=0.6
and a range of eccentricities. Comparing to the value obtained by considering
the instantaneous Roche lobe at pericentre we find that the radius of the star
required for mass transfer to begin decreases systematically with increasing
eccentricity.

encountered in sensor networks for scientific data collection. Consider an
undirected graph $G=(V \cup \{\mathbf{sink}\},E)$. Each vertex $v \in V$ holds
a constant-sized reading normalized to 1 byte that needs to be communicated to
the $\mathbf{sink}$. The communication protocol is defined such that readings
travel in packets. The packets have a capacity of $k$ bytes. We define a {\em
packet hop} to be the communication of a packet from a vertex to its neighbor.
Each packet hop drains one unit of energy and therefore, we need to communicate
the readings to the $\mathbf{sink}$ with the fewest number of hops.
  We show this problem to be NP-hard and counter it with a simple distributed
$(2-\frac{3}{2k})$-approximation algorithm called {\tt SPT} that uses the
shortest path tree rooted at the $\mathbf{sink}$. We also show that {\tt SPT}
is absolutely optimal when $G$ is a tree and asymptotically optimal when $G$ is
a grid. Furthermore, {\tt SPT} has two nice properties. Firstly, the readings
always travel along a shortest path toward the $\mathbf{sink}$, which makes it
an appealing solution to the convergecast problem as it fits the natural
intuition. Secondly, each node employs a very elementary packing strategy.
Given all the readings that enter into the node, it sends out as many fully
packed packets as possible followed by at most 1 partial packet. We show that
any solution that has either one of the two properties cannot be a
$(2-\epsilon)$-approximation, for any fixed $\epsilon > 0$. This makes \spt
optimal for the class of algorithms that obey either one of those properties.

holographic renormalization group (RG) flow. It is conjectured that the
extremal black hole space-time is holographically dual to the chiral two
dimensional field theory. Our example is a typical four dimensional
Reissner-Nordstrom black hole, a system in which the M5-brane is wrapped on
four cycles of Calabi-Yau threefold. In five dimensional supergravity view
point this near horizon geometry is $AdS_3\times S^2$, and three dimensional
gravity coupled to moduli fields is effectively obtained after a dimensional
reduction on $S^2$. Constructing the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, we define the
holographic RG flow from the three dimensional gravity. The central charge of
the Virasoro algebra is calculable from the conformal anomaly at the point
where the beta function defined from gravity side becomes zero. In general, we
can also identify the c-function of the dual two dimensional field theory. We
show that these flow equations are completely equivalent to not only BPS but
also non-BPS attractor flow equations of the muduli fields. The attractor
mechanism by which the values of the moduli fields are fixed at the event
horizon of the extremal black hole can be understood equivalently to the fact

fragile behavior to strong behavior, and the order of the hydrogen-bond network
increases. The temperature of the weak crossover from fragile to strong
behavior is found to coincide with the temperature at which maximum possible
order of the hydrogen-bond network is reached so that the structure becomes
temperature independent. In the strong regime, the temperature dependence of
water translation and rotational dynamics is characterized by an activation
energy of ca. E_a=0.43 eV, consistent with results from previous dielectric
spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance studies on protein hydration
waters. At these temperatures, a distorted pi-flip motion about the twofold
molecular symmetry axes, i.e., a water-specific beta process is an important
aspect of water dynamics, at least at the water-peptide interfaces. In
addition, it is shown that the hydration waters exhibit pronounced dynamical
heterogeneities, which can be traced back to a strong slowdown of water motion
in the immediate vicinity of peptide molecules due to formation of
water-peptide hydrogen bonds.

and Keck observations of HDE 245059, a young weak-lined T Tauri star (WTTS),
member of the pre-main sequence group in the Lambda Orionis Cluster. Our high
spatial resolution, near-infrared observations with Keck reveal that HDE 245059
a binary separated by 0.87"". Based on this new information we have obtained an
estimate of the masses of the binary components; 3M_{sun} and 2.5M_{sun} for
the north and south components, respectively. We have estimated the age of the
system to be ~2-3 Myr. We detect both components of the binary in the zeroth
order Chandra image and in the grating spectra. Our fits to the spectrum of the
binary have shown that the emission is dominated by a plasma between 8 and 15
MK, a soft component at 4 MK and a hard component at 50 MK are also detected.
The value of the hydrogen column density was low, 8 x 10^{19} cm^{-2}, likely
due to the clearing of the inner region of the Lambda Orionis cloud. The
abundance pattern shows an inverse First Ionization Potential (FIP) effect for
all elements from O to Fe, the only exception being Ca. A 3-T model was fitted
to the individual zeroth order spectra using the abundances derived for the
binary. We have also obtained several lines fluxes from the grating spectra.
The fits to the triplets show no evidence of high densities. We conclude that
the X-ray properties of the weak-lined T Tau binary HDE 245059 are similar to
those generally observed in other weak-lined T Tau stars. Although its
accretion history may have been affected by the clearing of the interstellar
material around Lambda Ori, its coronal properties appears not to have been
strongly modified.

further show that instead of two sets of channels with manifold cross-links

begin with a very simple coding protocol for two robots. Based on on this
protocol, we provide one-to-one communication for any system of n \geq 2 robots
equipped with observable IDs that agree on a common direction (sense of
direction). We then propose two solutions enabling one-to-one communication
among anonymous robots. Since the robots are devoid of observable IDs, both
protocols build recognition mechanisms using the (weak) capabilities offered to
the robots. The first protocol assumes that the robots agree on a common
direction and a common handedness (chirality), while the second protocol
assumes chirality only. Next, we show how the movements of robots can provide
implicit acknowledgments in asynchronous systems. We use this result to design
asynchronous one-to-one communication with two robots only. Finally, we combine
this solution with the schemes developed in synchronous settings to fit the
general case of asynchronous one-to-one communication among any number of

the scaling variable $t_{\rm obs}/t_{\rm w}^\mu$,where $t_{\rm w}$ is the time
at which the field conjugated to the response is turned on or off, and where
$t_{\rm obs}$ is the `observation' time elapsed from the field change. The
response curve obtained for different values of $t_w$ are usually collapsed
using values of $\mu$ slightly below one, a scaling behavior generally known as
\emph{sub-aging}. Recent spin glass Thermoremanent Magnetization experiments
have shown that the value of $\mu$ is strongly affected by the form of the
initial cooling protocol (Rodriguez et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 037203, 2003),
and even more importantly, (Kenning et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 057201, 2006)
that the $t_{\rm w}$ dependence of the response curves vanishes altogether in
the limit $t_{\rm obs} \gg t_{\rm w}$. The latter result shows that the widely
used $t_{\rm obs}/t_{\rm w}^\mu$ scaling of linear response data cannot be
generally valid, and casts some doubt on the theoretical significance of the
exponent $\mu$. In this work, a common mechanism is proposed for the origin of
both sub-aging and end of aging behavior in glassy dynamics. The mechanism
combines real and configuration space properties of the state produced by the
initial thermal quench which initiates the aging process.

black holes in a hydrodynamic setup. We study the stability of plasma balls,
holographic duals of Scherck-Schwarz (SS) AdS black holes. We find that
rotating plasma balls are unstable against m-lobed perturbations for rotation
rates higher than a critical value. This unstable mode signals a bifurcation to
a new branch of non-axisymmetric stationary solutions which resemble a
""peanut-like"" rotating plasma. The gravitational dual of the rotating plasma
ball must then be unstable and possibly decay to a non-axisymmetric long-lived
SS AdS black hole. This instability provides therefore a mechanism that bounds
the rotation of SS black holes. Our results are strictly valid for the SS AdS
gravity theory dual to a SS gauge theory. The latter is particularly important
because it shares common features with QCD, namely it is non-conformal,
non-supersymmetric and has a confinement/deconfinement phase transition. We
focus our analysis in 3-dimensional plasmas dual to SS AdS_5 black holes, but
many of our results should extend to higher dimensions and to other gauge

flow is solved using exponential asymptotics. The results demonstrate that the
flow is unstable for arbitrarily strong rotation and stratification; in
particular, both cyclonic and anticyclonic flows are unstable. The instability
is weak, however, with growth rates that are exponentially small in the Rossby
number. The analytic expression obtained for the growth rate elucidates its

first bodies to have accreted and differentiated in the Solar Nebula, predating
the formation of Jupiter and surviving the violent evolution of the early Solar
System. The formation time of Ceres instead is unknown, but it should not
postdate that of Jupiter by far. In this work we modelled the collisional
histories of Vesta and Ceres at the time of the formation of Jupiter, assumed
to be the first giant planet to form. In this first investigation of the
evolution of the early Solar System, we did not include the presence of
planetary embryos in the disk of planetesimals but we concentrated on the role
of the forming Jupiter and the effects of its possible inward migration due to
disk-planet interactions. Our results clearly indicate that the formation of
the giant planet caused an intense early bombardment in the orbital region of
the Main Asteroid Belt. According to our results, Vesta and Ceres would not
have survived the Jovian early bombardment if the disk was populated mainly by
large planetesimals like those predicted to form in turbulent circumstellar
disks. Disks dominated by small bodies, like those predicted to form in
quiescent circumstellar disks, or with a varying fraction of the mass in the
form of larger (D \geq 100 km) planetesimals represent more favourable
environments for the survival of the two asteroids. In those scenarios where
they survive, both asteroids had their surfaces saturated by craters as big as
150 km and a few as big as 200 - 300 km. In the case of Vesta, the Jovian early
bombardment would have significantly eroded (locally or globally) the crust and
possibly caused effusive phenomena similar to the lunar maria, whose
crystallisation time would then be directly linked to the time of the formation
of Jupiter.

(2007), using a 3D-geometrical description of the spatial distribution of all
the members of the LG (not only the satellites of the MW and M31) based on
present-day data on positions and distances, found that all galaxies (MW, M31,
their satellites, and even the most distant objects) are confined within a slab
of about 200 kpc thickness. Examining how external galaxies or groups would
gravitationally affect (and eventually alter) the planar structure (and its
temporal evolution) of the LG, they found that the external force field acts
parallel to the plane determined by geometry and studied this with the Least
Action Principle. In this paper, we have thoroughly investigated the role
played by the tidal forces exerted by external galaxies or galaxy groups on the
LG galaxies (the most distant dwarfs in particular) in shaping their large
scale distribution. The idea based on the well known effect of tidal
interactions, according to which a system of mass-points can undergo not only
tidal stripping but also tidal compression and thus become flatter. Excluding
the dwarf galaxies tightly bound to the MW and M31, the same tidal forces can
account for the planar distribution of the remaining dwarf galaxies. We
analytically recover the results of Pasetto & Chiosi (2007) and prove that a
planar distribution of the LG dwarf galaxies is compatible with the external
force field. We also highlight the physical cause of this result.

facing components, is a potentially serious issue for large Tokamaks such as

Magnetohydrodynamic Peeling-Ballooning instability, but recent numerical
calculations have suggested that a plasma equilibrium with an X-point - as is
found in all ITER-like Tokamaks, is stable to the Peeling mode. This contrasts
with analytical calculations (G. Laval, R. Pellat, J. S. Soule, Phys Fluids,
{\bf 17}, 835, (1974)), that found the Peeling mode to be unstable in
cylindrical plasmas with arbitrary cross-sectional shape. However the
analytical calculation only applies to a Tokamak plasma in a cylindrical
approximation. Here, we re-examine the assumptions made in cylindrical geometry
calculations, and generalise the calculation to an arbitrary Tokamak geometry
at marginal stability. The resulting equations solely describe the Peeling
mode, and are not complicated by coupling to the ballooning mode, for example.
We find that stability is determined by the value of a single parameter
$\Delta'$ that is the poloidal average of the normalised jump in the radial
derivative of the perturbed magnetic field's normal component. We also find
that near a separatrix it is possible for the energy principle's $\delta W$ to
be negative (that is usually taken to indicate that the mode is unstable, as in
the cylindrical theory), but the growth rate to be arbitrarily small.

Magnetohydrodynamic model could be used to determine the stability of a Tokamak

determined by the value of $\Delta'$, a normalised measure of the discontinuity
in the radial derivative of the radial perturbation to the magnetic field at
the plasma-vacuum interface. Here we calculate $\Delta'$, but in a way that
avoids the numerical divergences that can arise near a separatrice's X-point.
This is accomplished by showing how the method of conformal transformations may
be generalised to allow their application to systems with a non-zero boundary
condition, and using the technique to obtain analytic expressions for both the
vacuum energy and $\Delta'$. A conformal transformation is used again to obtain
an equilibrium vacuum field surrounding a plasma with a separatrix. This allows
the subsequent evaluation of the vacuum energy and $\Delta'$. For a
plasma-vacuum boundary that approximates a separatrix, the growth rate $\gamma$
normalised by the Aflven frequency $\gamma_A$ is then found to have
$\ln(\gamma/\gamma_A)=-{1/2} \ln (q'/q)$. Consequences for Peeling mode

indicate that the superconducting transition maintains the mean-field character

superconducting gap, which is well described by the conventional BCS
$T-$dependence. The mean-field critical temperature reaches maximum at the
optimal doping and decreases with underdoping. Such behavior is inconsistent

  Communications and Networking",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents the joint impact of the numbers of antennas,
source-to-channel bandwidth ratio and spatial correlation on the optimum
expected end-to-end distortion in an outage-free MIMO system. In particular,
based on an analytical expression valid for any SNR, a closed-form expression
of the optimum asymptotic expected end-to-end distortion valid for high SNR is
derived. It is comprised of the optimum distortion exponent and the
multiplicative optimum distortion factor. Demonstrated by the simulation
results, the analysis on the joint impact of the optimum distortion exponent
and the optimum distortion factor explains the behavior of the optimum expected
end-to-end distortion varying with the numbers of antennas, source-to-channel
bandwidth ratio and spatial correlation. It is also proved that as the
correlation tends to zero, the optimum asymptotic expected end-to-end
distortion in the setting of correlated channel approaches that in the setting
of uncorrelated channel. The results in this paper could be performance
objectives for analog-source transmission systems. To some extend, they are
instructive for system design.

  Journal","Tohoku Math. J. 63 (2011), 183-215",,,"math.DG math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The quaternionic KP hierarchy is the integrable hierarchy of p.d.e obtained
by replacing the complex numbers with the quaternions, mutatis mutandis, in the
standard construction of the KP hierarchy equations and solutions; it is
equivalent to what is often called the Davey-Stewartson II hierarchy. This
article studies its relationship with the theory of quaternionic holomorphic
2-tori in HP^1 (which are equivalent to conformally immersed 2-tori in S^4).
After describing how the Sato-Segal-Wilson construction of KP solutions
(particularly solutions of finite type) carries over to this quaternionic
setting, we compare three different notions of ""spectral curve"": the QKP
spectral curve, which arises from an algebra of commuting differential
operators; the (unnormalised) Floquet multiplier spectral curve for the related
Dirac operator; and the curve parameterising Darboux transforms of a conformal
2-torus in S^4 (in the sense of Bohle, Leschke, Pedit and Pinkall). The latter
two are shown to be images of the QKP spectral curve, which need not be smooth.
Moreover, it is a singularisation of this QKP spectral curve, rather than the
normalised Floquet multiplier curve, which determines the classification of
conformally immersed 2-tori of finite spectral genus.

depend solely on the dimension of the lattice. For one and two dimensions it
equals one, meaning unit probability to return to the origin. This result is
extremely sensitive to the directional symmetry, any deviation from the equal
probability to travel in each direction results in a change of the character of
the walk from recurrent to transient. Applying our definition of the Polya
number to quantum walks on a line we show that the recurrence character of
quantum walks is more stable against bias. We determine the range of parameters
for which biased quantum walks remain recurrent. We find that there exist
genuine biased quantum walks which are recurrent.

allows us to tune a more realistic model of the proton wavefunction from the pp

mantle and core formation and differentiation, delayed radiogenic heating,
earthquakes, and tidal friction account for the surface heat flux in the Earth.
Radiogenic heating is of much interest in various fields of geosciences.
Inferences from recent experiments with reactor antineutrinos and solar
neutrinos showed that the age of geoneutrinos is at hand for constraining
radiogenic heat. Because of the deep penetrating properties of the neutrinos
this type of radiation in the decay of the heat producing elements (HPE) is
ideally suited for the investigation of the deep interiors of the Earth
compared to conventional radiometric methods for HPE employing alpha-, beta-
and gamma rays. This presentation will address the considerations for a
dedicated geoneutrino detector to be set up for investigating the interior
regions all the way to the center of the Earth.
