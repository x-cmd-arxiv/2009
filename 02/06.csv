confirming the efficiency of variability in detecting quasars. We detect: i)
extended objects which would have escaped the colour selection and ii) objects
of very low X-ray to optical ratio. Several objects resulted to be
narrow-emission line galaxies where variability indicates nuclear activity,
while no emission lines were detected in others. Some of these galaxies have
variability and X-ray to optical ratio close to active galactic nuclei, while
others have much lower variability and X-ray to optical ratio. This result can
be explained by the dilution of the nuclear light due to the host galaxy. Our
results demonstrate the effectiveness of supernova search programmes to detect
large samples of low-luminosity AGNs. A sizable fraction of the AGN in our

shearing box have shown that the asymptotic strength of the magnetic field
declines steeply with increasing resolution. Here I model the MRI driven dynamo
as a large scale dynamo driven by the vertical magnetic helicity flux. This
growth is balanced by large scale mixing driven by a secondary instability. The
saturated magnetic energy density depends almost linearly on the vertical
height of the typical eddies. The MRI can drive eddies with arbitrarily large
vertical wavenumber, so the eddy thickness is either set by diffusive effects,
by the magnetic tension of a large scale vertical field component, or by
magnetic buoyancy effects. In homogeneous, zero magnetic flux, simulations only
the first effect applies and the saturated limit of the dynamo is determined by
explicit or numerical diffusion. The exact result depends on the numerical
details, but is consistent with previous work, including the claim that the
saturated field energy scales as the gas pressure to the one quarter power
(which we interpret as an artifact of numerical dissipation). The magnetic
energy density in a homogeneous shearing box will tend to zero as the
resolution of the simulation increases, but this has no consequences for the
dynamo or for angular momentum transport in real accretion disks. The claim
that the saturated state depends on the magnetic Prandtl number may also be an
artifact of simulations in which microphysical transport coefficients set the
MRI eddy thickness. Finally, the efficiency of the MRI dynamo is a function of
the ratio of the Alfv\'en velocity to the product of the pressure scale height
and the local shear. As this approaches unity from below the dynamo reaches
maximum efficiency.

feed on randomly located vegetation patches and disperse their seeds, thus
modifying the spatial distribution of resources in the long term. It is assumed
that the survival probability of a seed increases with the distance to the
parent patch and decreases with the size of the colonized patch. In turn, the
foraging agents use a deterministic strategy with memory, that makes them visit
the largest possible patches accessible within minimal travelling distances.
The combination of these interactions produce complex spatio-temporal patterns.
If the patches have a small initial size, the vegetation total mass (biomass)
increases with time and reaches a maximum corresponding to a self-organized
critical state with power-law distributed patch sizes and L\'evy-like movement
patterns for the foragers. However, this state collapses as the biomass sharply
decreases to reach a noisy stationary regime characterized by corrections to
scaling. In systems with low plant competition, the efficiency of the foraging
rules leads to the formation of heterogeneous vegetation patterns with
$1/f^{\alpha}$ frequency spectra, and contributes, rather counter-intuitively,
to lower the biomass levels.

observed in X-rays with Chandra and/or XMM-Newton in order to study the
relationship between QSOs with broad CIV absorption lines (BALs; width >2000
km/s) and those with CIV mini-BALs (here defined to have widths of 1000--2000
km/s). Our sample includes 42 BAL and 48 mini-BAL QSOs. The relative X-ray
brightness and hard spectral slopes of the mini-BAL population are, on average,
intermediate between those of BAL and non-BAL QSOs, as might be expected if
narrower and broader absorption line outflows are physically related. However,
a significant population of mini-BALs has outflow velocities higher than would
be expected for BAL QSOs of the same relative X-ray brightness. Consistenly
strong X-ray absorption is apparently not required to accelerate at least some
mini-BALs to high outflow velocities. Assuming the mini-BAL features are
correctly attributed to intrinsic CIV absorption, we suggest that their
observed properties may be explained if mini-BALs are ""seeds"" which can be
accelerated to form BALs when sufficient X-ray shielding is present.
  We also examine several QSOs with broad CIV absorption that have been
recently reported to be unusually X-ray bright. Such cases are frequently
mini-BAL QSOs, which as a population are generally brighter in X-rays than BAL
QSOs. Pointed XMM-Newton observations also suggest that these sources (or
unresolved neighbors) may have been previously observed in a high flux state.

habitable zones around M-stars are weakly protected against galactic cosmic
rays (GCRs), leading to a strongly increased particle flux to the top of the
planetary atmosphere. Two main effects were held responsible for the weak
shielding of such an exoplanet: (a) For a close-in planet, the planetary
magnetic moment is strongly reduced by tidal locking. Therefore, such a
close-in extrasolar planet is not protected by an extended magnetosphere. (b)
The small orbital distance of the planet exposes it to a much denser stellar
wind than that prevailing at larger orbital distances. This dense stellar wind
leads to additional compression of the magnetosphere, which can further reduce
the shielding efficiency against GCRs. In this work, we analyse and compare the
effect of (a) and (b), showing that the stellar wind variation with orbital
distance has little influence on the cosmic ray shielding. Instead, the weak
shielding of M star planets can be attributed to their small magnetic moment.
We further analyse how the planetary mass and composition influence the
planetary magnetic moment, and thus modify the cosmic ray shielding efficiency.
We show that more massive planets are not necessarily better protected against
galactic cosmic rays, but that the planetary bulk composition can play an
important role.

wide-field, multiband imaging and spectroscopy of galaxies in a complete sample
of 77 X-ray selected nearby clusters (0.04<z<0.07) located far from the
galactic plane (b>20deg). The main goal of this project is to establish a local
reference sample for evolutionary studies of galaxies and galaxy clusters.
Aims. This paper presents the near-infrared (J,K) photometric catalogs of 28
clusters of the WINGS sample and describes the procedures followed to construct
them. Methods. The raw data has been reduced at CASU and special care has been
devoted to the final coadding, drizzling technique, astrometric solution and
magnitude calibration for the WFCAM pipeline processed data. We have
constructed the photometric catalogs based on the final calibrated coadded
mosaics (0.79 deg2) in J (19 clusters) and K (27 clusters) bands. A customized
interactive pipeline has been used to clean the catalogs and to make mock
images for photometric errors and completeness estimates. Results. We provide
deep near-infrared photometric catalogs (90% complete in detection rate at
total magnitudes J =20.5, K =19.4, and in classification rate at J = 19.5 and K
= 18.5), giving positions, geometrical parameters, total and aperture
magnitudes for all detected sources. For each field we classify the detected
sources as stars, galaxies and objects of ""unknown"" nature.

results known concerning the first problem in the case of classical modular

cells. The model rationalizes an unexpected poor correlation between the
mid-point of in vivo promoter activity profiles and in vitro equilibrium
constants for MarA binding to promoter sequences. Analysis of the promoter
activity data using the model yielded the following predictions regarding
activation mechanisms: (1) MarA activation of the marRAB, sodA, and micF
promoters involves a net acceleration of the kinetics of transitions after RNA
polymerase binding, up to and including promoter escape and message elongation;
(2) RNA polymerase binds to these promoters with nearly unit occupancy in the
absence of MarA, making recruitment of polymerase an insignificant factor in
activation of these promoters; and (3) instead of recruitment, activation of
the micF promoter might involve a repulsion of polymerase combined with a large
acceleration of the kinetics of polymerase activity. These predictions are
consistent with published chromatin immunoprecipitation assays of interactions
between polymerase and the E. coli chromosome. A lack of recruitment in
transcriptional activation represents an exception to the textbook description
of activation of bacterial sigma-70 promoters. However, use of accelerated
polymerase kinetics instead of recruitment might confer a competitive advantage
to E. coli by decreasing latency in gene regulation.

studied on a fixed Kerr-anti de Sitter background

(a=0), $\psi$ remains uniformly bounded on the black hole exterior provided
that $\alpha < {9/4}$, i.e. the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound holds. Our proof
is based on vectorfield multipliers and commutators: The usual energy current
arising from the timelike Killing vector field $T$ (which fails to be
non-negative pointwise) is shown to be non-negative with the help of a Hardy
inequality after integration over a spacelike slice. In addition to $T$, we
construct a vectorfield whose energy identity captures the redshift producing
good estimates close to the horizon. The argument is finally generalized to
slowly rotating Kerr-AdS backgrounds. This is achieved by replacing the Killing
vectorfield $T=\partial_t$ with $K=\partial_t + \lambda \partial_\phi$ for an
appropriate $\lambda \sim a$, which is also Killing and--in contrast to the
asymptotically flat case--everywhere causal on the black hole exterior. The
separability properties of the wave equation on Kerr-AdS are not used. As a
consequence, the theorem also applies to spacetimes sufficiently close to the
Kerr-AdS spacetime, as long as they admit a causal Killing field $K$ which is
null on the horizon.

additional significant component of random bulk motion is required by the high
local velocity dispersion. The size scale of the typical gas disk is found to
have a radius of ~30 pc with a comparable vertical height. Within this radius
the average gas mass is estimated to be ~10^7 Msun based on a typical gas mass
fraction of 10%, which suggests column densities of Nh ~ 5x10^23 cm^-2.
Extinction of the stellar continuum within this same region suggest lower
column densities of Nh ~ 2x10^22 cm^-2, indicating that the gas distribution on
these scales is dominated by dense clumps. In half of the observed Seyfert
galaxies this lower column density is still great enough to obscure the AGN at
optical/infrared wavelengths. We conclude, based on the spatial distribution,
kinematics, and column densities that the molecular gas observed is spatially
mixed with the nuclear stellar population and is likely to be associated with
the outer extent of any smaller scale nuclear obscuring structure. Furthermore,
we find that the velocity dispersion of the molecular gas is correlated with
the star formation rate per unit area, suggesting a link between the two
phenomena, and that the gas surface density follows known ""Schmidt-Kennicutt""
relations. The molecular/dusty structure on these scales may be dynamic since
it is possible that the velocity dispersion of the gas, and hence the vertical
disk height, is maintained by a short, massive inflow of material into the
nuclear region and/or by intense, short-lived nuclear star formation.

potential of upcoming projects, including DES, Pan-STARRS, and LSST. These
surveys will map out the cosmic core-collapse supernova redshift distribution
via direct counting, with very small statistical uncertainties out to a
redshift depth which is a strong function of the survey limiting magnitude.
This supernova redshift history encodes rich information about cosmology, star
formation, and supernova astrophysics and phenomenology; the large statistics
of the supernova sample will be crucial to disentangle possible degeneracies
among these issues. For example, the cosmic supernova rate can be measured to
high precision out to z ~ 0.5 for all core-collapse types, and out to redshift
z ~ 1 for Type IIn events. Because of the tight link between supernovae and
star formation, synoptic sky surveys will provide precision measurements of the
normalization and z < 1 history of cosmic star-formation rate in a manner
independent of and complementary to current methods. Furthermore, Type II
supernovae can serve as distance indicators and would independently cross-check
Type Ia distances measured in the same surveys. Arguably the largest and
least-controlled uncertainty in these efforts comes from dust obscuration of
supernovae in their host galaxies; we outline a strategy to determine
empirically the obscuration properties by leveraging the large supernova
samples over a broad range of redshift. [abstract abridged]

  Global View of Bionetwork Dynamics: Adaptive Landscape",,,"q-bio.QM q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quantifying the adaptive landscape in a given dynamical processes has been
one of most important goals in theoretical biology. It can have immediate
implications for many dynamical properties, such as robustness and plasticity.
Based on recent work here I give a nontechnical brief review of this powerful
quantitative concept in biology. This concept was initially proposed by S
Wright 70 years ago, re-introduced by one of the founders of molecular biology
and by others in different biological contexts. It was apparently forgotten by
mainstream modern biologists for many years. Currently, this concept has found
its increasingly important role in the development of systems biology and the
modeling of bionetwork dynamics, from phage lambda genetic switch to endogenous
network of cancer genesis and progression. It is an ideal quantify to describe
the robustness and stability of bionetworks. I will first introduce five
landmark proposals in biology on this concept, to demonstrate the important
common thread in its theoretical biology development. Then I will discuss a few
recent results, focusing on the work showing the logical consistency of
adaptive landscape. From the perspective of a working scientist and of what
needed for a dynamical theory when confronting empirical data, the adaptive
landscape is useful both metaphorically and quantitatively and has captured an
essential aspect of biological dynamical processes. Still, many important open
problems remain to be solved. Having this important problem under control, we
may expect that we are on the right road to quantitatively formulate the
evolutionary dynamics discovered by Darwin and Wallace.

confirm earlier findings for brighter GRBs. The bolometric peak flux of short

plane, short bursts being less energetic by a factor similar to the ratio of
their durations. If short and long GRBs had similar redshift distributions,
they would have similar luminosities yet different energies, which correlate
with the peak energy E_peak for the population of long GRBs. We also test
whether short GRBs are consistent with the E_peak-E_iso and E_peak-L_iso
correlations for the available sample of short (6 events) and long (92 events)
GRBs with measured redshifts and E_peak,obs: while short GRBs are inconsistent
with the E_peak-E_iso correlation of long GRBs, they could follow the

spiral galaxy NGC 6503, and produce HI maps of considerably higher quality than
previous observations by van Moorsel & Wells (1985). We find that the velocity
field, while remarkably regular, contains clear evidence for irregularities.
The HI is distributed over an area much larger than the optical image of the
galaxy, with spiral features in the outer parts and localized holes within the
HI distribution. The absence of absorption towards the nearby quasar 1748+700
yields an upper limit of 5 10^{17} cm^{-2} for the column density of cold HI
gas along a line of sight which should intersect the disk at a radius of 29
kpc. This suggests that the radial extent of the HI disk is not much larger
than that which we trace in HI emission (23 kpc). The observed HI distribution
is inconsistent with models of a single thin or thick disk. Instead, the data
require a model containing a thin disk plus a thicker low column-density HI
layer that rotates more slowly than the thin disk and that extends only to
approximately the optical radius. This suggests that the presence of
extra-planar gas in this galaxy is largely the result of star formation in the
disk rather than cold gas accretion. Improved techniques for interferometric
imaging including multi-scale Clean that were used in this work are also

  Tables",,,,"KU-EC-09-1","stat.ME stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spatial interaction between two or more classes or species has important
implications in various fields and causes multivariate patterns such as
segregation or association. Segregation occurs when members of a class or
species are more likely to be found near members of the same class or
conspecifics; while association occurs when members of a class or species are
more likely to be found near members of another class or species. The null
patterns considered are random labeling (RL) and complete spatial randomness
(CSR) of points from two or more classes, which is called \emph{CSR
independence}, henceforth. The clustering tests based on nearest neighbor
contingency tables (NNCTs) that are in use in literature are two-sided tests.
In this article, we consider the directional (i.e., one-sided) versions of the
cell-specific NNCT-tests and introduce new directional NNCT-tests for the
two-class case. We analyze the distributional properties; compare the empirical
significant levels and empirical power estimates of the tests using extensive
Monte Carlo simulations. We demonstrate that the new directional tests have
comparable performance with the currently available NNCT-tests in terms of
empirical size and power. We use four example data sets for illustrative
purposes and provide guidelines for using these NNCT-tests.

were subsequently identified as originating from the Be/X-ray binary system XTE

a targeted search for radio pulsations from this source possible. The detection
of pulsed radio emission from XTE J0103-728 would make it only the second
system after PSR B1259-63 that is both a Be/X-ray binary and a radio pulsar. We
observed XTE J0103-728 in Feb 2008 with the Parkes 64-m radio telescope soon
after the identification of the source of X-ray pulsations was reported in
order to search for corresponding radio pulsations. We used a continuous 6.4
hour observation with a 256 MHz bandwidth centered at 1390 MHz using the center
beam of the Parkes multibeam receiver. In the subsequent data analysis, which
included a folding search, a Fourier search, a fast-folding algorithm search,
and a single-pulse search, no pulsed signals were found for trial dispersion
measures (DMs) between 0 and 800 pc cm^-3. This DM range easily encompasses the
expected values for sources in the SMC. We place an upper limit of ~45 mJy
kpc^2 on the luminosity of periodic radio emission from XTE J0103-728 at the
epoch of our observation, and we compare this limit to a range of luminosities
measured for PSR B1259-63, the only Be/X-ray binary currently known to emit
radio pulses. We also compare our limit to the radio luminosities of neutron
stars having similarly long spin periods to XTE J0103-728. Since the radio
pulses from PSR B1259-63 are eclipsed and undetectable during the portion of
the orbit near periastron, repeated additional radio search observations of XTE
J0103-728 may be valuable if it is undergoing similar eclipsing and if such

critical statistical mechanical model. Tunneling from one edge to another at a

investigating the structure, dynamics and evolution of the coronae of solar
active regions. In a series of NLFFF modeling studies, we have found that NLFFF
models are successful in application to analytic test cases, and relatively
successful when applied to numerically constructed Sun-like test cases, but
they are less successful in application to real solar data. Different NLFFF
models have been found to have markedly different field line configurations and
to provide widely varying estimates of the magnetic free energy in the coronal
volume, when applied to solar data. NLFFF models require consistent, force-free
vector magnetic boundary data. However, vector magnetogram observations
sampling the photosphere, which is dynamic and contains significant Lorentz and
buoyancy forces, do not satisfy this requirement, thus creating several major
problems for force-free coronal modeling efforts. In this article, we discuss
NLFFF modeling of NOAA Active Region 10953 using Hinode/SOT-SP, Hinode/XRT,
STEREO/SECCHI-EUVI, and SOHO/MDI observations, and in the process illustrate
the three such issues we judge to be critical to the success of NLFFF modeling:
(1) vector magnetic field data covering larger areas are needed so that more
electric currents associated with the full active regions of interest are
measured, (2) the modeling algorithms need a way to accommodate the various
uncertainties in the boundary data, and (3) a more realistic physical model is
needed to approximate the photosphere-to-corona interface in order to better
transform the forced photospheric magnetograms into adequate approximations of
nearly force-free fields at the base of the corona. We make recommendations for
future modeling efforts to overcome these as yet unsolved problems.

fermions, mostly focusing on the case of CeCoIn$_5$, a heavy-fermion
superconductor with a critical temperature of 2.3 K. This is a well-established
technique to investigate superconducting order parameters via measurements of
the differential conductance from nanoscale metallic junctions. Andreev
reflection is clearly observed in CeCoIn$_5$ as in other heavy-fermion
superconductors. The measured Andreev signal is highly reduced to the order of
maximum $\sim$ 13% compared to the theoretically predicted value (100%).
Analysis of the conductance spectra using the extended BTK model provides a
qualitative measure for the superconducting order parameter symmetry, which is
determined to be $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave in CeCoIn$_5$. A phenomenological model is
proposed employing a Fano interference effect between two conductance channels
in order to explain both the conductance asymmetry and the reduced Andreev
signal. This model appears plausible not only because it provides good fits to
the data but also because it is highly likely that the electrical conduction
occurs via two channels, one into the heavy electron liquid and the other into
the conduction electron continuum. Further experimental and theoretical
investigations will shed new light on the mechanism of how the coherent
heavy-electron liquid emerges out of the Kondo lattice, a prototypical strongly
correlated electron system. Unresolved issues and future directions are also

(EOT). Toward this goal, we designed and fabricated a one dimensional diatomic
chain of slit-hole resonator (SHR). Due to the strong exchange current
interaction, a type of magnetic plasmon (MP) propagation mode with a broad
frequency bandwidth was established in this system. Apparent EOT peaks induced
by the MP mode were observed in our measured spectra at infrared frequencies.
The strongest EOT peak was obtained at 1.07 eV with an incident angle of 20
degree. The measured dependence of EOT peaks on the incident angle coincided
with the theoretical results quite well. This proposed MP propagation mode in
SHR structure has good potential applications in multifrequency nonlinear

investigate the disk oxygen abundance gradient and its time evolution. Two star
formation rates (SFRs) are considered, one is the classical Kennicutt-Schmidt
law ($ \Psi = 0.25 \Sigma_{\rm{gas}}^{1.4}$, hereafter C-KS law), another is
the modified Kennicutt law ($\Psi = \alpha \Sigma_{{\rm{gas}}}^{1.4} ({V/r})$,
hereafter M-KS law). In both cases, the model can produce some amount of
abundance gradient, and the gradient is steeper in the early epoch of disk
evolution. However, we find that when C-KS law is adopted, the classical
chemical evolution model, which assumes a radial dependent infall time scale,
cannot produce a sufficiently steep present-day abundance gradient. This
problem disappears if we introduce a disk formation time scale, which means
that at early times, infalling gas cools down onto the inner disk only, while
the outer disk forms later. This kind of model, however, will predict a very
steep gradient in the past. When the M-KS law is adopted, the model can
properly predict both the current abundance gradient and its time evolution,
matching recent observations from planetary nebulae and open clusters along the
Milky Way disk. Our best model also predicts that outer disk (artificially
defined as the disk with $R_g \ge 8kpc$) has a steeper gradient than the inner
disk. The observed outer disk gradients from Cepheids, open clusters and young
stars show quite controversial results. There are also some hints from Cepheids
that the outer disk abundance gradient may have a bimodal distribution. More
data is needed in order to clarify the outer disk gradient problem. Our model
calculations show that for an individual Milky Way-type galaxy, a better
description of the local star formation is the modified KS law.

for prompt photon production using an optimized scale for factorization,
renormalization, and fragmentation and use of hydrodynamics suited for
non-central collisions along with a well tested equation of state admitting a
quark-hadron phase transition. A quantitative explanation of the data requires
a large initial temperature (at a small formation time of about 0.2 fm/$c$) and
a moderate increase in the prompt yield which could perhaps be attributed to
the Cronin effect in nuclei. The data can also be explained using a moderate
initial temperature (at a formation time of about 1 fm/$c$) with a very large
$K$-factor multiplying the prompt yield. We show that different initial times
give rise to different values for the elliptic flow parameter $v_2$ for thermal
photons. We also show that a measurement of $v_2$ for thermal photons could
also distinguish between the scenarios with or without a phase transition.

Galactic PNe among which 26 belong to the Galactic Bulge (GB). The mixed
chemistry is derived from the simultaneous detection of PAH features in the
6-14 micron range and crystalline silicates (CS) beyond 20 microns in the
Spitzer/IRS spectra. Out of the 26 PNe observed in the GB, 21 show signatures
of DDC. Our observations reveal that the simultaneous presence of O- and C-rich
dust features in the IR spectra of [WC]-type PNe is not restricted to late/cool
[WC]-type stars, as previously suggested in the literature, but is a common
feature associated with all [WC]-type PNe. Surprisingly, we found that the DDC
is seen also in all observed wels, as well as in other PNe with central stars
being neither [WC] nor wels. Most sources observed display CS features in their
spectra, with only a few PNe exhibiting, in addition, amorphous silicate bands.
We appear to detect a recent change of chemistry at the end of the AGB
evolution in the low-mass, high-metallicity population of GB PNe observed. The
deficit of C-rich AGB stars in this environment suggests that the process of
PAH formation in PNe occurs at the very end of the AGB phase. In addition, the
population of low-mass, O-rich AGB stars in the GB, do not exhibit CS features
in their spectra. Thus, the high detection rate of DDC that we find cannot be
explained by long-lived O-rich (primordial or circumbinary) disks. Our most
plausible scenario is a final thermal pulse on the AGB (or just after), which
could produce enhanced mass loss, capable of removing/mixing (sometimes
completely) the remaining H-rich envelope and exposing the internal C-rich
layers, and generating shocks responsible for the silicate crystallization.

global monopole, for the same false vacuum and symmetry breaking scale, a DBI
global monopole has a relatively smaller core and a larger absolute value of
effective mass. Thus, it can give out a larger deflect angle when the light

the stoichiometry and the topology of the underlying biochemical network is a
central issue in systems biology. In this task, it is important to devise
reasonable approximation schemes that rely on the stoichiometric data only,
because full-scale kinetic approaches are computationally affordable only for
small networks (e.g. red blood cells, about 50 reactions). Methods commonly
employed are based on finding the stationary flux configurations that satisfy
mass-balance conditions for metabolites, often coupling them to local
optimization rules (e.g. maximization of biomass production) to reduce the size
of the solution space to a single point. Such methods have been widely applied
and have proven able to reproduce experimental findings for relatively simple
organisms in specific conditions. Here we define and study a constraint-based
model of cellular metabolism where neither mass balance nor flux stationarity
are postulated, and where the relevant flux configurations optimize the global
growth of the system. In the case of E. coli, steady flux states are recovered
as solutions, though mass-balance conditions are violated for some metabolites,
implying a non-zero net production of the latter. Such solutions furthermore
turn out to provide the correct statistics of fluxes for the bacterium E. coli
in different environments and compare well with the available experimental
evidence on individual fluxes. Conserved metabolic pools play a key role in
determining growth rate and flux variability. Finally, we are able to connect
phenomenological gene essentiality with `frozen' fluxes (i.e. fluxes with
smaller allowed variability) in E. coli metabolism.

contact binary is presented. Energy is transported by a large-scale, steady
circulation carrying high entropy matter from the primary to secondary
component. The circulation is driven by the baroclinic structure of the common
envelope, which is a direct consequence of the nonuniform heating at the inner
critical Roche lobes due to unequal emergent energy fluxes of the components.
The mass stream flowing around the secondary is bound to the equatorial region
by the Coriolis force and its width is determined primarily by the flow
velocity. Its bottom is separated from the underlying secondary's convection
zone by a radiative transition layer acting as an insulator. For a typically
observed degree of contact the heat capacity of the stream matter is much
larger than radiative losses during its flow around the secondary. As a result,
its effective temperature and entropy decrease very little before it returns to
the primary. The existence of the stream changes insignificantly specific
entropies of both convective envelopes and sizes of the components. Substantial
oversize of the secondaries, required by the Roche geometry, cannot be
explained in this way. The situation can, however, be explained by assuming
that the primary is a main sequence star whereas the secondary is in an
advanced evolutionary stage with hydrogen depleted in its core. Such a
configuration is reached past mass transfer with mass ratio reversal. Good
agreement with observations is demonstrated by model calculations applied to
actual W UMa-type binaries. In particular, a presence of the equatorial bulge
moving with a relative velocity of 10-30 km/s around both components of AW UMa
is accounted for.

derive the equations governing the evolution of the scalar perturbations for a

to be radiation, we solve the coupled equations for the system numerically and
study the evolution of the perturbations from the sub-Hubble to the
super-Hubble scales. In particular, we analyze the effects of the transition
from tachyon driven inflation to the radiation dominated epoch on the evolution
of the large scale curvature and non-adiabatic pressure perturbations. We
consider two different tachyonic potentials and study the effects of two
possible types of decay of the tachyon into radiation. We plot the spectrum of
curvature perturbations at the end of inflation as well as at the early stages
of the radiation dominated epoch. We find that reheating does not affect the
amplitude of the curvature perturbations in any of these cases. These results
corroborate similar conclusions that have been arrived at earlier based on the
study of the evolution of the perturbations in the super-Hubble limit. We
illustrate that, before the transition to the radiation dominated epoch, the
relative non-adiabatic pressure perturbation between the tachyon and radiation
decays in a fashion very similar to that of the intrinsic entropy perturbation
associated with the tachyon. Moreover, we show that, after the transition, the
relative non-adiabatic pressure perturbation dies down extremely rapidly during
the early stages of the radiation dominated epoch. These behavior ensure that
the amplitude of the curvature perturbations remain unaffected during
reheating. We also discuss the corresponding results for the popular chaotic
inflation model in the case of the canonical scalar field. [abridged]

important information on the star formation process and early dynamical

characterizing the internal spatial structure of 16 open clusters in the Milky
Way spanning a wide range of ages. Cluster stars have been selected from a
membership probability analysis based on a non-parametric method that uses both
positions and proper motions and does not make any a priori assumption on the
underlying distributions. The internal structure is then characterized by means
of the minimum spanning tree method (Q parameter), King profile fitting, and
the correlation dimension (Dc) for those clusters with fractal patterns. On
average, clusters with fractal-like structure are younger than those exhibiting
radial star density profiles and an apparent trend between Q and age is
observed in agreement with previous ideas about the dynamical evolution of the
internal spatial structure of stellar clusters. However, some new results are
obtained from a more detailed analysis: (a) a clear correlation between Q and
the concentration parameter of the King model for those cluster with radial
density profiles, (b) the presence of spatial substructure in clusters as old
as 100 Myr, and (c) a significant correlation between fractal dimension and age
for those clusters with internal substructure. Moreover, the lowest fractal
dimensions seem to be considerably smaller than the average value measured in

discretization effects. As a result, two dominant systematic errors of the $B_
K$ determination with Wilson fermions are kept under control. With the Clover
term included in the fermion action, we perform a feasibility study and find,
in the quenched approximation, a significant improvement of the scaling
behaviour of $B_K$, compared to earlier standard tmQCD determinations.
Moreover, we study in detail the $K^0$-$\overline K^0$ mass splitting that
characterizes this approach and confirm that, in the presence of the Clover

diagonalizing the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE). Our results confirmed the
existence of bound excitons in the crystal. Both the electronic gap and optical
gap decrease continuously and non-linearly as pressure of up to 6 GPa is
applied. As a result, the absorption spectrum shows strong redshift. We also
obtained that ""negative"" pressure shows the opposite behavior: the gaps
increase and the optical spectrum shifts toward the blue end of the spectrum.
Negative pressure can be realized by adding cubane (C$_8$H$_8$) or other
molecules with similar size to the interstitials of the microcrystal. For the

shell models with ballistic gas motion, constant temperature, constant degree
of ionisation and a power law for the density profile. We reach a surface
brightness limit of $5\times10^{-8} ergs s^{-1} cm^{-2} sr^{-1}$. A halo is
detected, but at a much higher surface brightness than our models of
recombination emission and dust scattering predict. Only collisional excitation
of Ly$\beta$ with partial de-excitation to H$\alpha$ could explain such

related to a real shell. We also investigated the feasibility of a
spectroscopic detection of high-velocity H$\alpha$ gas towards the centre of
the Crab nebula. Modelling of the emission spectra shows that such gas easily
evades detection in the complex spectral environment of the H$\alpha$-line. PSF
scattering significantly contaminates our data, preventing a detection of the

$2\times10^{-7} ergs s^{-1} cm^{-2} sr^{-1} $ could still be accomodated within
our error bars, but our models predict a factor 4 lower surface brightness. 8m
class telescopes could detect such fluxes unambiguously, provided that a
sufficiently accurate PSF model is available. Finally, we note that PSF
scattering also affects other research areas where faint haloes are searched

calibration of RGS can be obtained using Crab as a standard candle. We have
analysed RGS observations of the Crab using different instrument configurations

spectrum of the nebula plus pulsar. Due to the high spectral resolution of the
RGS, we resolve the main absorption edges and detect the strong 1s-2p
absorption lines of neutral oxygen. We get an excellent fit to the Crab
spectrum using this fixed continuum and the absorption spectrum determined by
RGS. We get accurate column densities for the neutral atoms of H, N, O, Ne, Mg,

ions. Our data are in good agreement with earlier optical and UV spectroscopic
measurements of some of these ions. We find solar abundances for N and O, while
Ne is overabundant by a factor of 1.7 and Fe is underabundant by a factor of

our high redshift selection using spectroscopic observations with the AAOmega

galaxy candidates in 4 separate fields. With just 1-hour of integration time

samples and find correlation lengths of r0=2.64 h-1 Mpc, r0=3.62 h-1 Mpc and
r0=5.88 h-1 Mpc for the low, mid and high redshift samples respectively.
Comparing these results with predicted dark matter clustering, we estimate the
bias parameter for each sample to be b=0.70, b=0.92 and b=1.46. We calculate
the 2-point redshift-space correlation function at z~0.6 and find a clustering

level distribution which has often been overlooked. We analyse a general tree
growth model proposed by Klemm {\em et. al.} (2005) to explain the growth of
user-generated directory structures in computers. The model has a single
parameter $q$ which interpolates between preferential attachment and random
growth. Our analysis results in three contributions: First, we propose a more
efficient estimation method for $q$ based on the degree distribution, which is
one specific representation of the model. Next, we introduce the concept of a
level distribution and analytically solve the model for this representation.
This allows for an alternative and independent measure of $q$. We argue that,
to capture real growth processes, the $q$ estimations from the degree and the
level distributions should coincide. Thus, we finally apply both
representations to validate the model with synthetically generated tree
structures, as well as with collected data of user directories. In the case of
real directory structures, we show that $q$ measured from the level
distribution are incompatible with $q$ measured from the degree distribution.
In contrast to this, we find perfect agreement in the case of simulated data.
Thus, we conclude that the model is an incomplete description of the growth of
real directory structures as it fails to reproduce the level distribution. This
insight can be generalised to point out the importance of the level
distribution for modeling tree growth.

success to localise Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In these instruments, the event
count rate is dominated by the photon background due to their large field of
view and large effective area. It is therefore essential to estimate the
instrument background expected in orbit during the early phases of the
instrument design in order to optimise the scientific performances of the
mission. We present here a detailed study of the instrument background and
sensitivity of the coded-mask camera for X- and Gamma-rays (CXG) to be used in

passive shield of the camera ensures that in the 4-50 keV imaging band the
cosmic X-Gamma-ray background is dominant whilst the internal background should
start to become dominant above 70-90 keV; ii) the current camera design ensures

algebras we generalize the notion of Artin-Schelter regular algebras of
dimension $n$ to algebras and categories to include Auslander algebras and a
graded analogue for infinite representation type. A generalized Artin-Schelter
regular algebra or a category of dimension $n$ is shown to have common
properties with the classical Artin-Schelter regular algebras. In particular,
when they admit a duality, then they satisfy Serre duality formulas and the
$\Ext$-category of nice sets of simple objects of maximal projective dimension
$n$ is a finite length Frobenius category.

classical as well as in quantum mechanics. The main purpose is to elucidate the
role of this kind of symmetries in the reduction of physical problems, to show
algebraic possibilities of derivation of spectra. The original results are
presented also. They are hidden symmetries in the Dirac equation, where it is
shown that the requirement of invariance of the Dirac Hamiltonian under some
kind of Witten's superalgebra, picks out the Coulomb potential only. The
problem in the arbitrary higher dimensions is also considered. It is derived
that the traditional view on the Coulomb potential is to be changed in the
context of N=2 supersymmetry

  integrable systems: Continuation in the parameter space","23 pages and 5 figures",,"10.1007/s00220-009-0984-0",,"math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The initial value problem of an integrable system, such as the Nonlinear
Schr\"" odinger equation, is solved by subjecting the linear eigenvalue problem
arising from its Lax pair to inverse scattering, and, thus, transforming it to
a matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem (RHP) in the spectral variable. In the
semiclassical limit, the method of nonlinear steepest descent, supplemented by
the $g$-function mechanism, is applied to this RHP to produce explicit
asymptotic solution formulae for the integrable system. These formule are based
on a hyperelliptic Riemann surface $\Rscr=\Rscr(x,t)$ in the spectral variable,
where the space-time variables $(x,t)$ play the role of external parameters.
The curves in the $x,t$ plane, separating regions of different genuses of
$\Rscr(x,t)$, are called breaking curves or nonlinear caustics. The genus of
$\Rscr(x,t)$ is related to the number of oscillatory phases in the asymptotic
solution of the integrable system at the point $x,t$.
  In this paper we prove that in the case of a regular break, the nonlinear
steepest descent asymptotics can be ""automatically"" continued through the
breaking curve (however, the expressions for the asymptotic solution will be
different on the different sides of the curve). Although the results are stated
and proven for the focusing NLS equation, it is clear that they can be
reformulated for AKNS systems, as well as for the nonlinear steepest descend
method in a more general setting.

existence is considered to be a challenge for the LCDM cosmology, because
galaxy mergers isotropize stellar disks and trigger angular momentum transport
in gas disks, thus fostering the formation of central stellar spheroids. Here,
we postulate that the formation of stellar spheroids from gasrich disks is
controlled by two parameters that characterize galaxy mergers, the mass ratio
of merging dark matter halos, and the virial velocity of the larger merging
halo. We utilize merger histories generated from realizations of the
cosmological density field to calculate the fraction of dark matter halos that
have avoided spheroid formation, and compare the derived statistics with the
spheroid occupation fractions in surveys of nearby galaxies. We find, for
example, that the survival rate of disk-dominated galaxies in LCDM is just high
enough to explain the observed fractional representation of disk-dominated
galaxies in the universe if the only mergers which lead to central spheroid
formation are those with mass ratios M2/M1 > 0.3 and virial velocities Vvir,1 >
55 km/s. We discuss the physical origin of this criterion, and show that the
dependence of the disk-dominated fraction on galaxy mass provides a further
test of the merger hypothesis. [For additional details, see, Koda et al.

spatial resolution of solar telescopes. A synthetic infrared
spectropolarimetric diagnostics based on a 2D MHD simulation of
magnetoconvection is used for this. We analyze two time sequences of snapshots
that likely represent two regions of the network fields with their immediate
surrounding on the solar surface with the unsigned magnetic flux density of 300
and 140 G. In the first region we find from probability density functions of
the magnetic field strength that the most probable field strength at logtau_5=0
is equal to 250 G. Weak fields (B < 500 G) occupy about 70% of the surface,
while stronger fields (B 1000 G) occupy only 9.7% of the surface. The magnetic
flux is -28 G and its imbalance is -0.04. In the second region, these
parameters are correspondingly equal to 150 G, 93.3 %, 0.3 %, -40 G, and -0.10.
We estimate the distribution of line-of-sight velocities on the surface of log
tau_5=-1. The mean velocity is equal to 0.4 km/s in the first simulated region.
The averaged velocity in the granules is -1.2 km/s and in the intergranules is
2.5 km/s. In the second region, the corresponding values of the mean velocities
are equal to 0, -1.8, 1.5 km/s. In addition we analyze the asymmetry of
synthetic Stokes-V profiles of the Fe I 1564.8 nm line. The mean values of the
amplitude and area asymmetry do not exceed 1%. The spatially smoothed amplitude
asymmetry is increased to 10% while the area asymmetry is only slightly varied.
