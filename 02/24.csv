considered only the inspiral phase of binary black hole coalescence. Using an
""effective-one-body"" (EOB) approach calibrated to numerical relativity

two. Detection of the nonlinear memory could serve as an experimental test of

quark production from string balls at LHC and compare with the parton fusion
results at NNLO using pQCD. We find significant top quark production from

find that $\frac{d\sigma}{dp_T}$ of top quarks from string balls does not
decrease significantly with increase in $p_T$, whereas it deceases sharply in
case of standard model pQCD scenario. Hence, in the absence of black hole
production at LHC, an enhancement in top quark cross section and its abnormal

enhancement for H || a (H approx. 20 kOe) observed in DyMnO3 below 6.5 K is due
to a re-emergence of the Mn-induced Dy spin order with propagation vector k(Dy)
= k(Mn) = 0.385 b*, which accompanies the suppression of the independent Dy
magnetic ordering, k(Dy) = 1/2 b*. For GdMnO3, the Mn-induced ordering of Gd
spins is used to track the Mn-ordering propagation vector. The data confirm the
incommensurate ordering reported previously, with k(Mn) varying from 0.245 to
0.16 b* on cooling from T_N(Mn) down to a transition temperature T'. New
superstructure reflections which appear below T' suggest a propagation vector
k(Mn) = 1/4 b* in zero magnetic field, which may coexist with the previously
reported A-type ordering of Mn. The Gd spins order with the same propagation
vector below 7 K. Within the ordered state of Gd at T = 1.8 K we find a phase

a high Meissner shielding volume. Interestingly, the normal state resistivity

projected radial velocity semi-amplitude of K2 = 79 +/- 3 km/s, leading to a
mass function of 0.51 +/- 0.06 Msun, ~30% lower than the previous estimate. We
tentatively attribute the lower value of K2 (compared to that obtained by other

different epochs of observations. The limited phase coverage and/or longer
timebase of previous observations may also contribute to the difference in K2.
Our value for the mass function implies a primary mass of 1.5 +/- 0.3 Msun,
somewhat lower than previous dynamical estimates, but consistent with the value
found by analysis of type-I X-ray bursts from this system. Our Doppler
tomography of the broad He II 4686 line reveals that most of the emission from
this line is produced on the irradiated face of the donor star, with little
emission from the accretion disc. In contrast, the Doppler tomogram of the N
III 4640.64 Bowen blend line shows bright emission from near the gas
stream/accretion disc impact region, with fainter emission from the gas stream
and secondary star. This is the first LMXB for which the Bowen blend is
dominated by emission from the gas stream/accretion disc impact region, without
comparable emission from the secondary star. This has implications for the
interpretation of Bowen blend Doppler tomograms of other LMXBs for which the

exhibiting fundamental shortcomings of the conventional uncertainty measures in
terms of the radial position and momentum variances. The Shannon and R\'enyi
entropies, the Fisher information measure, as well as several related
information measures, are considered as viable alternatives. Detailed results
on the onset of relativistic effects for low nuclear charges, and on the
extreme relativistic limit, are presented. The relativistic position density
decays exponentially at large $r$, but is singular at the origin.
Correspondingly, the momentum density decays as an inverse power of $p$. Both
features yield divergent R\'enyi entropies away from a finite vicinity of the
Shannon entropy. While the position space information measures can be evaluated
analytically for both the nonrelativistic and the relativistic hydrogen atom,
this is not the case for the relativistic momentum space. Some of the results
allow interesting insight into the significance of recently evaluated
Dirac-Fock vs. Hartree-Fock complexity measures for many-electron neutral

accretion disks in the thermally-dominated state, using a Monte-Carlo
ray-tracing code in full general relativity. In contrast to many previously
published studies, our approach allows us to include returning radiation that
is deflected by the strong-field gravity of the BH and scatters off of the disk
before reaching a distant observer. Although carrying a relatively small
fraction of the total observed flux, the scattered radiation tends to be highly
polarized and in a direction perpendicular to the direct radiation. For
moderately large spin parameters (a/M >~ 0.9), this scattered returning
radiation dominates the polarization signal at energies above the thermal peak,
giving a net rotation in the polarization angle of 90 deg. We show how these
new features of the polarization spectra from BHs in the thermal state may be
developed into a powerful tool for measuring BH spin and probing the gas flow
in the innermost disk. In addition to determining the emission profile,
polarization observations can be used to constrain other properties of the
system such as BH mass, inclination, and distance. New instruments currently
under development should be able to exploit this tool in the near future.

distributions known in any galaxy to date (B-band exponential scale length
=0.57 kpc). In stark contrast to the compact stellar component, the neutral gas
is extremely extended; HI is detected to a radial distance of ~25 kpc at the
10^19 cm^-2 level (>44 B-band scale lengths). Comparing to measurements of
similar ""giant disk"" dwarf galaxies in the literature, ADBS 1138 has the
largest known HI-to-optical size ratio. The stellar component is located near
the center of a broken ring of HI that is ~15 kpc in diameter; column densities
peak in this structure at the ~3.5x10^20 cm^-2 level. At the center of this
ring, in a region of comparatively low HI column density, we find ongoing star
formation traced by H alpha emission. We sample the rotation curve to the point
of turn over; this constrains the size of the dark matter halo of the galaxy,
which outweighs the luminous component (stars + gas) by at least a factor of
15. To explain these enigmatic properties, we examine ""inside-out"" and
""outside-in"" evolutionary scenarios. Calculations of star formation energetics
indicate that ""feedback"" from concentrated star formation is not capable of
producing the ring structure; we posit that this is a system where the large HI
disk is evolving in quiescent isolation. In a global sense, this system is
exceedingly inefficient at converting neutral gas into stars.

transiting extrasolar giant planets have thermal inversions in their upper

altitude. Such an inversion probably requires a species at high altitude that
absorbs a significant amount of incident optical/UV radiation. Some authors
have suggested that the strong optical absorbers titanium oxide (TiO) and
vanadium oxide (VO) could provide the needed additional opacity. However, if
regions of the atmosphere are cold enough for Ti and V to be sequestered into
solids they might rain out and be severely depleted. With a model of the
vertical distribution of a refractory species in gaseous and condensed form, we
address the question of whether enough TiO (or VO) could survive aloft in an
irradiated planet's atmosphere to produce a thermal inversion. We find that,
without significant macroscopic mixing, a heavy species such as TiO --
especially one that can condense in a cold-trap region -- cannot persist in a
planet's upper atmosphere. In our model, the amount of macroscopic mixing that
would be required to loft TiO to millibar pressures ranges from ~10^7 to
~10^{11} cm^2/s on HD 209458b, HD 149026b, TrES-4, OGLE-TR-56b, and WASP-12b,

apply the formalism we develop to HD 209458b as an example. We find that for
strong enough tides the planet's radius can undergo a transient phase of
inflation that temporarily interrupts canonical, monotonic shrinking due to
radiative losses. Importantly, an earlier episode of tidal heating can result
in a planet with an inflated radius, even though its orbit has nearly
circularized. Moreover, we confirm that at late times, and under some
circumstances, by raising tides on the star itself a planet can spiral into its
host. We note that a 3$\times$ to 10$\times$solar planet atmospheric opacity
with no tidal heating is sufficient to explain the observed radius of HD

tidal heating we can fit the observed radius of HD 209458b even with lower
(solar) atmospheric opacities. This work demonstrates that, if a planet is left
with an appreciable eccentricity after early inward migration and/or dynamical
interaction, coupling radius and orbit evolution in a consistent fashion that
includes tidal heating, stellar irradiation, and detailed model atmospheres
might offer a generic solution to the inflated radius puzzle for transiting
extrasolar giant planets such as WASP-12b, TrES-4, and WASP-6b.

conditions under which each mode operates. Gas giant planets at disk radii
$r>100$ AU are likely to form in situ by disk instability, while core accretion
plus gas capture remains the dominant formation mechanism for $r<100$ AU.
During the mass accretion phase, mass loading can push disks toward
fragmentation conditions at large $r$. Massive, extended disks can fragment
into clumps of a few to tens of Jupiter masses. This is confirmed by radiation
hydrodynamics simulations. The two modes of gas giant formation should lead to
a bimodal distribution of gas giant semi-major axes. Because core accretion is
expected to be less efficient in low-metallicity systems, the ratio of gas
giants at large $r$ to planets at small $r$ should increase with decreasing
metallicity.

are preferentially dragged towards the disc plane. The material accreted from
these satellites forms a dark matter disc that contributes 0.25 - 1.5 times the
non-rotating halo density at the solar position. Here, we show the importance
of the dark disc for indirect dark matter detection in neutrino telescopes.
Previous predictions of the neutrino flux from WIMP annihilation in the Earth
and the Sun have assumed that Galactic dark matter is spherically distributed
with a Gaussian velocity distribution, the standard halo model. Although the
dark disc has a local density comparable to the dark halo, its higher phase
space density at low velocities greatly enhances capture rates in the Sun and
Earth. For typical dark disc properties, the resulting muon flux from the Earth
is increased by three orders of magnitude over the SHM, while for the Sun the
increase is an order of magnitude. This significantly increases the sensitivity
of neutrino telescopes to fix or constrain parameters in WIMP models. The flux
from the Earth is extremely sensitive to the detailed properties of the dark
disc, while the flux from the Sun is more robust. The enhancement of the muon
flux from the dark disc puts the search for WIMP annihilation in the Earth on
the same level as the Sun for WIMP masses < 100 GeV.

states of this source. We find that it is for all states well-described by a
power-law, with index ~-2 in the soft states and a tendency for a less steep
power-law in the hard state. At longer time-scales, we study the effect of the
state transitions on the PDS, and find that the variability below ~10^(-7) Hz
is dominated by the transitions. Furthermore, we find no correlation between
the length of a high/soft state episode and the time since the previous
high/soft state. On intermediate time-scales we find evidence for a break in
the PDS at time-scales of the order of the orbital period. This may be
interpreted as evidence for the existence of a tidal resonance in the accretion

have considered large new instruments such as Hanohano and LENA, they have
abandoned the possibility of doing useful measurements with higher energy
neutrino interactions since these produce enough light to illuminate every
photomultiplier tube, and the scintillation light is isotropic. Here we take
into account Fermat's principle, which tells us that indeed the first light to
reach the PMTs will be on or near the lightcone, the ""Fermat surface"", and that
directional track information is available. Moreover we have realized that
particle type distinction is possible (quasi-elastic muons from electrons). In
fact the resolution from a detector of comparable size to SuperKamiokande, may
be better in both angle, energy and possibly particle type. This realization
opens the doors to a number of applications. Moreover, this capability can be
demonstrated with the use of (future) KamLAND detected events in the new long

been shown, where the NHIM serves as the ""anchor"" for the construction of
dividing surfaces having the no-recrossing property and minimal flux. For the
index 1 saddle case the stable and unstable manifolds of the NHIM are
co-dimension one in the energy surface, and act as conduits for reacting
trajectories in phase space. The situation for index 2 saddles is quite
different. We show that NHIMs with their stable and unstable manifolds still

as barriers in the energy surface. Rather, there are different types of
invariant manifolds, containing the NHIM and its stable and unstable manifolds,
that act as co-dimension one barriers in the energy surface. These barriers
divide the energy surface in the vicinity of the index 2 saddle into regions of
qualitatively different trajectories exhibiting a wider variety of dynamical
behavior than for the case of index 1 saddles. In particular, we can identify a

laser excitation are characterized through an open quantum system approach. The
evolution of the fluorophore system follows from an effective Hamiltonian
microscopic dynamic where its characteristic parameters, i.e., its electric
dipole, transition frequency, and Rabi frequency, as well as the quantization
of the background electromagnetic field and their mutual interaction, are
defined in an extended Hilbert space associated to the different
configurational states of the local nano-environment. After tracing out the
electromagnetic field and the configurational states, the fluorophore density
matrix is written in terms of a Lindblad rate equation. Observables associated
to the scattered laser field, like optical spectrum, intensity-intensity
correlation, and photon-counting statistics, are obtained from a
quantum-electrodynamic calculation also based on the effective microscopic
dynamic. In contrast with stochastic models, this approach allows to describe
in a unified way both the full quantum nature of the scattered laser field as
well as the classical nature of the environment fluctuations. By analyzing
different processes such as spectral diffusion, lifetime fluctuations, and
light assisted processes, we exemplify the power of the present approach.

with a single-measurement precision of 0.4 km/s for most narrow-lined stars. We
use our radial-velocity data to calculate membership probabilities for stars
with >= 3 measurements, providing the first comprehensive membership study of
the cluster core that includes stars from the giant branch through the upper
main sequence. We identify 480 cluster members. Additionally, we identify
velocity-variable systems, all of which are likely hard binaries that
dynamically power the cluster. Using our single cluster members, we find a
cluster average radial velocity of 2.34 +/- 0.05 km/s . We use our kinematic
cluster members to construct a cleaned color- magnitude diagram from which we
identify rich giant, subgiant, and blue straggler populations and a
well-defined red clump. The cluster displays a morphology near the cluster
turnoff clearly indicative of core convective overshoot. Finally, we discuss a
few stars of note, one of which is a short-period red-clump binary that we

high-dimensional non-negative sparse vector from lower dimensional linear
measurements. While much work has focused on dense measurement matrices, sparse
measurement schemes are crucial in applications, such as DNA microarrays and
sensor networks, where dense measurements are not practically feasible. One
possible construction uses the adjacency matrices of expander graphs, which
often leads to recovery algorithms much more efficient than $\ell_1$
minimization. However, to date, constructions based on expanders have required
very high expansion coefficients which can potentially make the construction of
such graphs difficult and the size of the recoverable sets small.
  In this paper, we construct sparse measurement matrices for the recovery of
non-negative vectors, using perturbations of the adjacency matrix of an
expander graph with much smaller expansion coefficient. We present a necessary
and sufficient condition for $\ell_1$ optimization to successfully recover the
unknown vector and obtain expressions for the recovery threshold. For certain
classes of measurement matrices, this necessary and sufficient condition is
further equivalent to the existence of a ""unique"" vector in the constraint set,
which opens the door to alternative algorithms to $\ell_1$ minimization. We
further show that the minimal expansion we use is necessary for any graph for
which sparse recovery is possible and that therefore our construction is tight.
We finally present a novel recovery algorithm that exploits expansion and is
much faster than $\ell_1$ optimization. Finally, we demonstrate through
theoretical bounds, as well as simulation, that our method is robust to noise
and approximate sparsity.

extracted from the electric and magnetic form factors for each individual quark

present results for the higher order moments of the spin-3/2 baryons, including
the electric quadrupole moment E2 and the magnetic octupole moment M3. The
world's first determination of a non-zero M3 form factor for the Delta baryon
is presented. With these results we provide a conclusive analysis which shows
that decuplet baryons are deformed. We compare the decuplet baryon results from
a similar lattice calculation of the octet baryons. We establish that the
environment sensitivity is far less pronounced in the case of the decuplet
baryons compared to that in the octet baryons. A surprising result is that the
charge radii of the decuplet baryons are generally smaller than that of the
octet baryons. The magnetic moment of the Delta^+ reveals a turn over in the
low quark mass region, making it smaller than the proton magnetic moment. These
results are consistent with the expectations of quenched chiral perturbation
theory. A similar turn over is also noticed in the magnetic moment of the
Sigma^*0, but not for Xi^* where only kaon loops can appear in quenched QCD.
The electric quadrupole moment of the Omega^- baryon is positive when the

being most suitable for a mass reconstruction which combines both techniques.
Despite this, several previous studies have claimed a significant discrepancy
between the X-ray and the strong lensing mass estimates. The primary aim of
this paper is to address and explain this mismatch. For this purpose, we have
analysed Chandra observations to recover the profiles of the intra-cluster
medium properties and, assuming a functional form for the matter density, the
total mass distribution. The notable strong-lensing features of MS2137.3 allow
us to reconstruct its projected mass in the central regions with good accuracy,
by taking advantage of the lensing inversion code Lenstool. We find a good
agreement between our X-ray and strong lensing mass estimates for MS2137,
leading to a mean, extrapolated value of M_200 ~ 4.4 +/- 0.3*10^14 M_sun, under
the assumption of the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profile. However, the

that synchrotron emission is absorbed by foreground thermal plasma. We detected

the distance, R^{max}_w, at which the transmitted flux drops to =0.1 and a

elucidating the flow of linear momentum in black-hole binaries (BBHs). The
""gauge-dependence"" (arbitrariness) in the localization of linear momentum in
BBHs is discussed, along with the hope that the qualitative behavior of linear
momentum will be gauge-independent. Harmonic coordinates are suggested as a
possibly preferred foundation for fixing the gauge associated with linear
momentum. For a BBH or other compact binary, the Landau-Lifshitz formalism is
used to define the momenta of the binary's individual bodies in terms of
integrals over the bodies' surfaces or interiors, and define the momentum of
the gravitational field (spacetime curvature) outside the bodies as a volume
integral over the field's momentum density. These definitions will be used in
subsequent papers that explore the internal nonlinear dynamics of BBHs via
numerical relativity. This formalism is then used, in the 1.5PN approximation,
to explore momentum flow between a binary's bodies and its gravitational field
during the binary's orbital inspiral. Special attention is paid to momentum
flow and conservation associated with synchronous spin-induced bobbing of the
black holes, in the so-called ""extreme-kick configuration"" (where two identical

properties of the underlying disk. We investigate whether the fraction and
properties of bars in clusters are different from their counterparts in the
field. The total optical bar fraction in the redshift range z=0.4-0.8 (median
z=0.60), averaged over the entire sample, is 25% (20% for strong bars). For the
cluster and field subsamples, we measure bar fractions of 24% and 29%,
respectively. We find that bars in clusters are on average longer than in the
field and preferentially found close to the cluster center, where the bar
fraction is somewhat higher (~31%) than at larger distances (~18%). These
findings however rely on a relatively small subsample and might be affected by
small number statistics. In agreement with local studies, we find that
disk-dominated galaxies have a higher optical bar fraction (~45%) than
bulge-dominated galaxies (~15%). This result is based on Hubble types and
effective radii and does not change with redshift. The latter finding implies
that bar formation or dissolution is strongly connected to the emergence of the
morphological structure of a disk and is typically accompanied by a transition
in the Hubble type. (abridged)

leptonic triplet introduced to realize seesaw mechanism, with the usual charged
leptons. In this work we study these FCNC effects in a systematic way using
available experimental data. Several FCNC processes have been studied before.
The new processes considered in this work include: lepton flavor violating
processes $\tau \to P l$, $\tau \to V l$, $V \to l \bar l'$, $P \to l \bar l'$,
$M\to M' l \bar l'$ and muonium-antimuonium oscillation. Results obtained are
compared with previous results from $l_i \to l_j l_k \bar l_l$, $l_i \to l_j
\gamma$, $Z \to l \bar l'$ and $\mu - e$ conversion. Our results show that the
most stringent constraint on the $e$-to-$\tau$ FCNC effect comes from $\tau \to
\pi^0 e$ decay. $\tau \to \rho^0 \mu$ and $\tau \to \pi^0 \mu$ give very
stringent constraints on the $\mu$-to-$\tau$ FCNC effect, comparable with that
obtained from $\tau \to \mu \bar \mu \mu$ studied previously. The constraint on
the $e$-to-$\mu$ FCNC effect from processes considered in this work is much
weaker than that obtained from processes studies previously, in particular that
from $\mu - e$ conversion in atomic nuclei. We find that in the canonical
seesaw models the FCNC parameters, due to tiny neutrino masses, are all
predicted to be much smaller than the constraints obtained here, making such
models irrelevant. However, we also find that in certain special circumstances
the tiny neutrino masses do not directly constrain the FCNC parameters. In
these situations, the constraints from the FCNC studies can still play
important roles.

multiple times over 3.5 years using 7 optical filters, and has been calibrated
specifically for variability work. Palomar-QUEST allows for the study of rare
objects using multiple epochs of consistently calibrated, homogeneous data,
obviating the common problem of generating comparable measurements from
disparate datasets. A power law fit to the quasar structure function versus
time yields an index of 0.432 +/- 0.024 for our best measured sample. We see
the commonly reported anticorrelation between average optical variability
amplitude and optical luminosity, and measure the logarithmic decrease in
variability amplitude to scale as the logarithm of the luminosity times 0.205
+/- 0.002. Black hole mass is positively correlated with variability amplitude
over three orders of magnitude in mass. Quasar variability amplitude is seen to
decrease with Eddington ratio as a step function with a transition around
Eddington ratio of 0.5. The higher variability at low Eddington ratios is due
to excess power at timescales shorter than roughly 300 days. X-ray and radio
measurements exist for subsets of the quasar sample. We observe an
anticorrelation between optical variability amplitude and X-ray luminosity. No
significant correlation is seen between average optical variability properties
and radio luminosity. The timescales of quasar fluctuations are suggestive of
accretion disk instabilities. The relationships seen between variability,
Eddington ratio, and radio and X-ray emission are discussed in terms of a
possible link between the behavior of quasars and black hole X-ray binaries.

amplitude modulation with fixed eccentricity, eccentricity modulation, and
orientation modulation or precession. An application to the analysis of data

reviewed briefly. In particular, focus is put on the utilisation of the
classical Lie symmetry approach to derive classes of exact solutions from
atmospheric models. This is illustrated with the barotropic vorticity equation.
Moreover, the possibility for construction of partially-invariant solutions is
discussed for this model. A further point is a discussion of using symmetries
for relating different classes of differential equations. This is illustrated
with the spherical and the potential vorticity equation. Finally, discrete

which includes both uncrossability of the fibers and hydrodynamic interactions

collisions between the fibers are treated such that momentum and energy are
conserved locally. The choice of simulation parameters is rationalised on the
basis of dimensionless numbers expressing the relative strength of different
physical processes. The method is applied to suspensions of semiflexible fibers
with a contour length equal to the persistence length, and a mesh size to
contour length ratio ranging from 0.055 to 0.32. For such fibers the effects of
hydrodynamic interactions are observable, but relatively small. The
non-crossing constraint, on the other hand, is very important and leads to
hindered displacements of the fibers, with an effective tube diameter in
agreement with recent theoretical predictions. The simulation technique opens
the way to study the effect of viscous effects and hydrodynamic interactions in
microrheology experiments where the response of an actively driven probe bead

the magnetization inside the vortex core in the planar vortex distribution. In
both types of simulations a dip creation with a consequent vortex-antivortex

Our analytical approach is based on the transformation to the rotating frame of

a large number of thin, parallel threads piled together. Prominences often
display periodic disturbances mostly observed in the Doppler displacement of
spectral lines and with an amplitude typically of the order of or smaller than
2--3 km s$^{-1}$, a value which seems to be much smaller than the
characteristic speeds of the prominence plasma (namely the Alfv\'en and sound

oscillations is that they seem to damp in a few periods and that they seem not
to affect the whole prominence structure. In addition, in high spatial

oscillations appear to be clearly associated to these fine structure

identified, with a spatially-invariant power law mass distribution index of
-1.8. Most of the inner clumps show velocity gradients of 1-3 km/s/pc, directed
away from the exciting nebula. The gradients decrease with distance from the
central O stars, and are consistent with a photoionised gas acceleration model,
assuming clump lifetimes of a few 10^5 yrs. However, in one clear case, the
observed near-constant velocity gradient is difficult to explain with simple
models. Most blue-shifted but very few of the red-shifted clumps are associated
with dark absorbing optical globules, confirming that the dominant molecular
gas motion is expansion away from the central nebula and O stars. Many clumps
also lie in a molecular ring, having an expansion velocity of 30 km/s, radius
11pc, and dynamical lifetime of ~1Myr. The J=3-2/1-0 12CO line ratios of the
clumps decrease with distance from the O stars, implying a gradient in their
surface temperatures; the results are consistent with a simple model of clump
surface heating due to the central stars.
  Seven high-velocity molecular flows are found in the region, with a close
correspondence between these flows and embedded young clusters. These outflows
are sufficiently energetic to drive local gas turbulence within each cluster.
  We find 14 clear examples of association between embedded young stars seen at
24um and CO clumps; these are thought to be photoevaporating molecular
envelopes. The CO clumps without evidence of embedded stars tend to have lower
velocity gradients, and it is suggested that the presence of the young star may
extend the lifespan of the photoevaporating envelope.

Hubbard model with on-site repulsion $U$ and nearest-neighbor repulsion $V$ at
quarter filling using the density-matrix renormalization group method combined
with a variational principle. Our numerical results for the Hubbard model (V=0)
agree with exact results obtained from the Bethe ansatz solution. We obtain the
contour map for both Drude weights in the $UV$-parameter space for repulsive
interactions. We find that the charge Drude weight is discontinuous across the
Kosterlitz-Thouless transition between the Luttinger liquid and the
charge-density-wave insulator, while the spin Drude weight varies smoothly and
remains finite in both phases. Our results can be generally understood using
bosonization and renormalization group results. The finite-size scaling of the
charge Drude weight is well fitted by a polynomial function of the inverse
system size in the metallic region. In the insulating region we find an
exponential decay of the finite-size corrections with the system size and a
universal relation between the charge gap $\Delta_c$ and the correlation length
$\xi$ which controls this exponential decay.

Lennard-Jones chains in the solid phase. The bond length between monomers
within the chains is fixed to $L=\sigma$ and the molecule is free to adopt any

randomly locating the bonds of the chain within a face centered cubic close
packed arrangement of atoms. For fully flexible chains it is believed that the
stable solid phase is disordered. Such a solid is considered in this work.
Computer simulations were performed for chains with $m=3, 4$ and 5 monomer
units, and results were obtained for the equation of state and internal energy
of the chains. An extension of Wertheim's TPT1 to the solid phase of
Lennard-Jones chains (C.Vega, F.J.Blas and A.Galindo, J.Chem.Phys.,{\bf

the liquid-expanded surrounding. Nonetheless, an inhomogeneous interdigitation
along the nucleous boundary may occur inside a ``belt'' of a width that varies

relevant parameters of the LHT through the detection of these processes at the
ILC.

ionization pathways of a diatomic molecule driven by an intense infrared
(800nm) ultrashort laser pulse. For intensities corresponding to the tunneling
regime, we find that the three main ionization mechanisms have distinct traces
when considering the sum of the momenta parallel to the laser field as a
function of the inter-electronic angle of escape. In addition, we find that the
previously observed ""finger-like"" structure in the correlated momenta of the
strongly driven He is also present for strongly driven diatomic molecules. We
show that it is mainly due to the strong interaction, backscattering, the
recolliding electron undergoes from the remaining core.

liquid with arbitrary interaction g_2, and subject to a potential barrier of
arbitrary strength, as a function of temperature. We map the Hamiltonian in the
basis of scattering states into an effective low energy Hamiltonian in current
algebra form. First the renormalization group (RG) equation for weak
interaction is derived in the current operator language both using the operator
product expansion and the equation of motion method. To access the strong
coupling regime, two methods of deducing the RG equation from perturbation
theory, based on the scaling hypothesis and on the Callan-Symanzik formulation,
are discussed. The important role of scale independent terms is emphasized. The
latter depend on the regulaization scheme used (length versus temperature
cutoff). Analyzing the perturbation theory in the fermionic representation, the
diagrams contributing to the renormalization group beta-function are
identified. A universal part of the beta-function is given by a ladder series
and summed to all orders in g_2. First non-universal corrections beyond the
ladder series are discussed and are shown to differ from the exact solutions
obtained within conformal field theory which use a different regularization
scheme. The RG equation for the temperature dependent conductance is solved
analytically. Our result agrees with known limiting cases.

recently been demonstrated. Here we propose a technique that permits one to
quantify the contribution of such non-conservative component. This is an
extension of a standard optical tweezers calibration technique and, therefore,
can easily become a standard test to verify the conservative optical force
assumption. Using this technique we have analyzed different-sized optically
trapped particles under different trapping conditions. We conclude that the
non-conservative effects are effectively negligible and do not affect the
standard calibration procedure, unless for extremely low-power trapping, far
away from the trapping regimes usually used in experiments.
