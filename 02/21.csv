emphasis on competing magnetic interactions, structural phase transition, giant
magneto-elastic coupling and its effect on phonons. The exchange interactions
$J_{i,j}(R)$ are calculated up to $\approx 12 $\AA $. We find that $J_{i,j}(R)$
has an oscillatory character with an envelop decaying as $1/R^3$ along the
stripe-direction while it is very short range along the diagonal direction and
antiferromagnetic. A brief discussion of the neutron scattering determination
of these exchange constants from a single crystal sample with orthorhombic
twinning is given. The lattice parameter dependence of the exchange constants,
$dJ_{i,j}/da$ are calculated for a simple spin-Peierls like model to explain
the fine details of the tetragonal-orthorhombic phase transition. We then
discuss giant magneto-elastic effects in these systems. We show that when the
Fe-spin is turned off the optimized c-values are shorter than experimetnal
values by 1.4 \AA $ $ for CaFe$_2$As$_2$, by 0.4 \AA $ $ for BaFe$_2$As$_2$,
and by 0.13 \AA $ $ for LaOFeAs. Finally, we show that Fe-spin is also required
to obtain the right phonon energies, in particular As c-polarized and Fe-Fe
in-plane modes. Since treating iron as magnetic ion always gives much better
results than non-magnetic ones and since there is no large c-axis reduction
during the normal to superconducting phase transition, the iron magnetic moment
should be present in Fe-pnictides at all times. We discuss the implications of
our results on the mechanism of superconductivity in these fascinating
Fe-pnictide systems.

on two commonly used methods to determine dust properties from dust continuum
observations of dense cores. One method employs a direct fit to a modified
blackbody SED; the other involves a comparison of flux ratios to an analytical
prediction. Fitting fluxes near the SED peak produces inaccurate temperature
and dust spectral index estimates due to the line of sight temperature (and
density) variations. Longer wavelength fluxes in the Rayleigh-Jeans part of the
spectrum (>~ 600 micron for typical cores) may more accurately recover the
spectral index, but both methods are very sensitive to noise. The temperature
estimate approaches the density weighted temperature, or ""column temperature,""
of the source as short wavelength fluxes are excluded. An inverse temperature -
spectral index correlation naturally results from SED fitting, due to the
inaccurate isothermal assumption, as well as noise uncertainties. We show that
above some ""threshold"" temperature, the temperatures estimated through the flux
ratio method can be highly inaccurate. In general, observations with widely
separated wavelengths, and including shorter wavelengths, result in higher
threshold temperatures; such observations thus allow for more accurate
temperature estimates of sources with temperatures less than the threshold
temperature. When only three fluxes are available, a constrained fit, where the
spectral index is fixed, produces less scatter in the temperature estimate when
compared to the estimate from the flux ratio method.

unbroken light curve from 1902 to the present, assembled from the visual data
archives of five major variable star observing organizations from around the
world. We applied several time-series analysis techniques to search for two
specific kinds of variability: long secondary periods (LSPs) longer than the
dominant pulsation period of ~333 days, and long-term period variation in the
dominant pulsation period itself. The data quality is sufficient to detect
coherent periodic variations with photometric amplitudes of 0.05 mag or less.
We do not find evidence for coherent LSPs in o Ceti to a limit of 0.1 mag,
where the amplitude limit is set by intrinsic, stochastic, low-frequency
variability of approximately 0.1 mag. We marginally detect a slight modulation
of the pulsation period similar in timescale to that observed in the Miras with
meandering periods, but with a much lower period amplitude of +/-2 days.
However, we do find clear evidence of a low-frequency power-law component in
the Fourier spectrum of o Ceti's long-term light curve. The amplitude of this
stochastic variability is approximately 0.1 mag at a period of 1000 days, and
it exhibits a turnover for periods longer than this. This spectrum is similar

non-Markovian quantum jump (NMQJ) approach is a generalization of the Markovian
Monte Carlo Wave Function (MCWF) method into the non-Markovian regime. The
method conserves both the probabilities in the density matrix and the norms of
the state vectors exactly, and sheds new light on non-Markovian dynamics. The
dynamics of the pure state ensemble illustrates how local-in-time master
equation can describe memory effects and how the current state of the system
carries information on its earlier state. Our approach solves the problem of
negative jump probabilities of the Markovian MCWF method in the non-Markovian

below the hidden sector scale $\Lambda_h$ there are many light hidden sector
quarks. Simply, by counting engineering dimensions the hidden sector instanton
potential can be made negligible compared to the QCD anomaly term.

overwhelming contribution of the hot intergalactic medium. They are therefore
suited to studying the X-ray characteristics relative to their intrinsic
properties. We analyzed our own XMM-Newton and archival Chandra data in detail
for three objects, and derived, when possible, the spatial and spectral
characteristics of each source. An upper limit for the fourth one was obtained
from archival ASCA data. We compared their characteristics with those of other
23 isolated objects for which X-ray and optical data are available in the
literature. We explored possible theoretical explanations to interpret our
results. In spite of our attempt to select very homogeneous objects, both in
terms of optical properties and environmental characteristics, we find a wide
range in X-ray luminosities and LX/LB ratios for the four objects: two of them
show a hot gaseous halo, whereas no gas is detected in the other two, to a
factor >10 in luminosity. In fact, we find a large spread in the LX/LB for all
galaxies considered, suggesting that the presence of hot gas is not easily
related to the optical luminosity or to the mass, even in isolated systems.
Younger objects tend to be less luminous in X-rays than older systems. However,
it appears that older objects could span a wide range in luminosities.

carry on this approach, we compare texts from European and Brazilian

features of the sentences which can be automatically retrieved. This is an
entirely new approach from the linguistic point of view. Our statistical
contribution is the introduction of the smallest maximizer criterion which is a
constant free procedure for model selection. As a by-product, this provides a
solution for the problem of optimal choice of the penalty constant when using
the BIC to select a variable length Markov chain. Besides proving the
consistency of the smallest maximizer criterion when the sample size diverges,
we also make a simulation study comparing our approach with both the standard
BIC selection and the Peres-Shields order estimation. Applied to the linguistic

regime are calculated. The electrostatic potential in the sheet is modeled by a
trapezoid barrier, which allows to use the exact solution of the Dirac equation
in a uniform electric field in the slope areas (the two lateral sides of the
trapezoid). A special attention is devoted to asymmetry with respect to the
sign of the gate voltage, which is connected with the difference between the
Klein tunneling and the over-barrier reflection. The comparison of the
developed theory with the experiment supports the conclusion that the Klein
tunneling was revealed experimentally.

distributed computing, as a ""blockage"" in our tile assembly model is analogous
to a crash failure in a distributed computing model.) We also define a

expectation about consensus algorithms that is often implicit in distributed

asymptotic QCD constraints. From the scalar form factor study, the modulus of
the K*_0(1430) decay constant is found to be (32 +/- 5) MeV. The additional
phenomenological amplitudes are fitted to reproduce the K pi effective mass and
helicity angle distributions, the B --> K*(892) pi branching ratios and the CP

We consider the random MST, in which the edge costs are (quenched) independent
random variables. There is a strongly-disordered spin-glass model due to Newman
and Stein [Phys. Rev. Lett. 72, 2286 (1994)], which maps precisely onto the

Kruskal's greedy algorithm for finding the MST, and bond percolation. We solve
the random MST problem on the Bethe lattice (BL) with appropriate wired
boundary conditions and calculate the fractal dimension D=6 of the connected
components. Viewed as a mean-field theory, the result implies that on a lattice
in Euclidean space of dimension d, there are of order W^{d-D} large connected
components of the random MST inside a window of size W, and that d = d_c = D =
6 is a critical dimension. This differs from the value 8 suggested by Newman

improved scaling argument that again yields d_c=6. The result implies that the
strongly-disordered spin-glass model has many ground states for d>6, and only
of order one below six. The results for MSTs also apply on the Poisson-weighted
infinite tree, which is a mean-field approach to the continuum model of MSTs in

galaxies. The relativistic electrons producing this diffuse synchrotron
emission should also produce inverse Compton emission that becomes competitive
with thermal emission from the ICM at hard X-ray energies. Thus far, claimed
detections of this emission in Coma are controversial (Fusco-Femiano et al.
2004; Rossetti & Molendi 2004). We present a Suzaku HXD-PIN observation of the
Coma cluster in order to nail down its non-thermal hard X-ray content. The
contribution of thermal emission to the HXD-PIN spectrum is constrained by
simultaneously fitting thermal and non-thermal models to it and a spatially
equivalent spectrum derived from an XMM-Newton mosaic of the Coma field
(Schuecker et al. 2004). We fail to find statistically significant evidence for
non-thermal emission in the spectra, which are better described by only a
single or multi-temperature model for the ICM. Including systematic
uncertainties, we derive a 90% upper limit on the flux of non-thermal emission
of 6.0x10^-12 erg/s/cm^2 (20-80 keV, for photon index of 2.0), which implies a
lower limit on the cluster-averaged magnetic field of B>0.15 microG. Our flux
upper limit is 2.5x lower than the detected non-thermal flux from RXTE
(Rephaeli & Gruber 2002) and BeppoSAX (Fusco-Femiano et al. 2004). However, if
the non-thermal hard X-ray emission in Coma is more spatially extended than the
observed radio halo, the Suzaku HXD-PIN may miss some fraction of the emission.
A detailed investigation indicates that ~50-67% of the emission might go
undetected, which could make our limit consistent with these detections. The
thermal interpretation of the hard Coma spectrum is consistent with recent
analyses of INTEGRAL (Eckert et al. 2007) and Swift (Ajello et al. 2009) data.

neutralinos comprising a compact object can not achieve thermal equilibrium. To

constructed a model of the star made of pure neutralinos. We explicitly showed
that the condition for the thermal equilibrium supported by the Fermi pressure
is never fulfilled inside the star. This neutralino state can not be described

is performed to assess the behavior of both evaporation and condensation fronts
when subject to incompressible, corrugational perturbations with wavelengths
larger than the thickness of the front. We discuss the behavior of fronts in
both super-Alfvenic and sub-Alfvenic flows. Since the propagation speed of
fronts is slow in the ISM, it is the sub-Alfvenic regime that is relevant, and
magnetic fields are a significant influence on front dynamics. In this case we
find that evaporation fronts, which are unstable in the hydrodynamic regime,
are stabilized. Condensation fronts are unstable, but for parameters typical of
the neutral ISM the growth rates are so slow that steady state fronts are
effectively stable. However, the instability may become important if
condensation proceeds at a sufficiently fast rate. This paper is the first in a

(IMBHs), forming dark matter (DM) ``mini-spikes'' around them, has received
considerable attention in recent years. In fact, leading in some scenarios to
large annihilation fluxes in gamma rays, neutrinos and charged cosmic rays,
these objects are sometimes quoted as one of the most promising targets for
indirect DM searches. In this letter, we apply a detailed statistical analysis
to point out that the existing EGRET data already place very stringent limits
on those scenarios, making it rather unlikely that any of these objects will be
observed with, e.g., the Fermi/GLAST satellite or upcoming Air Cherenkov
telescopes. We also demonstrate that prospects for observing signals in
neutrinos or charged cosmic rays seem even worse. Finally, we address the
question of whether the excess in the cosmic ray positron/electron flux
recently reported by PAMELA/ATIC could be due to a nearby DM point source like
a DM clump or mini-spike; gamma-ray bounds, as well as the recently released
Fermi cosmic ray electron and positron data, again exclude such a possibility
for conventional DM candidates, and strongly constrain it for DM purely
annihilating into light leptons.

for the hypersonic gas seen as faint extended broad emission lines with a full
width zero intensity of 7000km/s. Aims. We explore the possibility that the
observed broad profiles are the result of the interaction of a high velocity
cluster wind with dense photoionized clumps. Methods. The geometry considered
is that of near static photoionized condensations at the surface of which
turbulent mixing layers arise as a result of the interaction with the hot wind.
The approximative treatment of turbulence is carried out using the mixing
length approach of Canto & Raga. The code mappings Ic is used to derive the
mean quantities describing the flow and to compute the line emissivities within
the turbulent layers. The velocity projection in three dimensions of the line
sources is carried out analytically. Results. A fast entraining wind of up to
~4300km/s appears to be required to reproduce the faint wings of the broad
H-alpha and [O III] profiles. A slower wind of 3500km/s, however, can still
reproduce the bulk of the broad component and does provide a better fit than an
ad hoc Gaussian profile. Conclusions. Radial acceleration in 3D (away from
supercluster A) of the emission gas provides a reasonable first order fit to
the broad line component. No broad component is predicted for the [N II] and [S
II] lines, as observed. The wind velocity required is uncomfortably high and

from jets rather than from an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) when
the X-ray luminosity $L_{\rm X}$ of the source is below a critical value of
$L_{\rm X,crit} \approx 10^{-6}L_{\rm Edd}$. This prediction implies that the
X-ray spectrum in such sources should be fitted by jets rather than ADAFs.
Furthermore, below $L_{\rm X,crit}$ the correlation between radio ($L_{\rm R}$)
and X-ray ($L_{\rm X}$) luminosities and the black hole mass ($M$)--the
so-called fundamental plane of black hole activity--should deviate from the
general correlation obtained by Merloni, Heinz & Di Matteo (2003) and become
steeper. The Merloni et al. correlation is described by ${\rm log}L_{\rm R}
=0.6{\rm log}L_{\rm X}+0.78{\rm log}M+7.33$, while the predicted correlation is
${\rm log}L_{\rm R}=1.23{\rm log}L_{\rm X} +0.25{\rm log}M-13.45$. We collect

find that among the 16 LLAGNs with good X-ray and radio spectra, 13 are
consistent with the Yuan & Cui prediction. For the 22 LLAGNs with $L_{\rm X} <

model on the $\theta$-type lattice with the on-site $U$ and the nearest
neighbor $V_p$ and $V_c$ interactions, the diagonal stripe, c-axis three-fold,
and the vertical stripe charge correlations are favored in the regime $V_p<
V_c$, $V_p\sim V_c$, and $V_p> V_c$, respectively. In the realistic parameter
regime of $V_p\sim V_c$, there is a competition between c-axis three fold state
and the diagonal stripe state. Since these are different from the
experimentally observed a-axis three fold and the horizontal stripe charge
correlations, additional effects have to be included in order to understand the
experiments. The electron-lattice coupling, which tends to distort the lattice
into the $\theta_d$-type, is found to favor the horizontal stripe state,
suggesting that the occurrence of this stripe ordering in the actual materials
may not be of purely electronic origin. On the other hand, distant
electron-electron interactions have to be considered in order to understand the
a-axis three fold correlation, whose wave vector is close to the nesting vector
of the Fermi surface. These studies seem to suggest that the minimal model to
understand the charge correlation in $\theta$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2X$ may be more
complicated than expected. Future problems regarding the competition between
different types of charge correlations are discussed.

black hole (itself fed by inflow of intracluster gas), to their outskirts,
where the infall of intergalactic medium (IGM) drives shocks and accelerates
cosmic rays. Beyond the cluster confines lies the virtually unexplored warm
IGM, believed to contain most of the baryonic matter in the present-day

carries unique information on the history of energy and metal production in the
Universe. Currently planned major observatories, such as Astro-H and IXO, will
make deep inroads into these areas, but to see the most interesting parts of
the picture will require an almost science-fiction-grade facility with tens of

  Turbulence","7 pages, 6 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.81.064512",,"cond-mat.other","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The theory describing the evolution of inhomogeneous vortex tangle at zero
temperature is developed on the bases of kinetics of merging and splitting
vortex loops. Vortex loops composing the vortex tangle can move as a whole with
some drift velocity depending on their structure and their length. The flux of
length, energy, momentum etc. executed by the moving vortex loops takes a
place. Situation here is exactly the same as in usual classical kinetic theory
with the difference that the ""carriers"" of various physical quantities are not
the point particles, but extended objects (vortex loops), which possess an
infinite number of degrees of freedom with very involved dynamics. We offer to
fulfill investigation basing on supposition that vortex loops have a Brownian
structure with the only degree of freedom, namely, lengths of loops $l$. This
conception allows us to study dynamics of the vortex tangle on the basis of the
kinetic equation for the distribution function $n(l,t)$ of the density of a
loop in the space of their lengths. Imposing the coordinate dependence on the
distribution function $n(l,\mathbf{% r},t)$ and modifying the ""kinetic""
equation with regard to inhomogeneous situation, we are able to investigate
various problem on the transport processes in superfluid turbulence. In this
paper we derive relation for the flux of the vortex line density
$\mathcal{L}(x,t)$. The correspoding evolution of quantity $\mathcal{L}(x,t)$
obeys the diffusion type equation as it can be expected from dimensional
analysis. The according diffusion coefficient is evaluated from calculation of
the (size dependent) free path of the vortex loops. We use this equation to
describe the decay of the vortex tangle at very low temperature. We compare
that solution with recent experiments on decay of the superfluid turbulence.

given difference of potentials in one direction and constant external
electrical field $\vE_\text{out}$ in another direction in the plane of a film.
To derive the model we employ the spatial averaging over the normal coordinate
to a film that leads to the average Reynolds stress that is proportional to
$|\vE_\text{out}|^3$. This stress generates tangential velocity in the vicinity
of the edges of a film that, in turn, causes the rotational motion of a liquid.

merger time-scale of galaxies in a high-resolution cosmological hydro/N-body

numerical implementation of baryonic physics on the merger time-scale. The
simulation used in the previous work suffers from the overcooling problem which
causes the central galaxies of large halos too massive. This may result in a
shortened merger time-scale compared to that in the real universe. We run a
similar simulation, but the stellar mass is significantly reduced to model
another extreme case of low stellar mass. Our result shows that the merger
time-scale is little affected by the star formation recipes, except for the
satellites in nearly radial orbits which show a 22 percent higher time-scale in
the lower stellar mass case. Since the radial orbits only account for a small
part of the satellites' orbits, the fitting formula in Jiang et al.(2008) is
still applicable to a reasonable accuracy, nearly immune to the uncertainty in
the baryonic physics.
