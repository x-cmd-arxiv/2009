extended chiral algebra, and with central charges c_L, c_R > 1) contains a
primary operator with dimension Delta_1 that satisfies 0 < Delta_1 < (c_L +
c_R)/12 + 0.473695. Translated into gravitational language using the AdS_3
/CFT_2 dictionary, our result proves rigorously that the lightest massive
excitation in any theory of 3D gravity with cosmological constant Lambda < 0
can be no heavier than 1/(4 G_N) + o(|Lambda|^(1/2)). In the flat-space
approximation, this limiting mass is twice that of the lightest BTZ black hole.
The derivation of the bound applies at finite central charge for the CFT, and
does not rely on an asymptotic expansion at large central charge. Neither does
our proof rely on any special property of the CFT such as supersymmetry or
holomorphic factorization, nor on any bulk interpretation in terms of string
theory or semiclassical gravity. Our only assumptions are unitarity and modular
invariance of the dual CFT. Our proof demonstrates for the first time that
there exists a universal center-of-mass energy beyond which a theory of ""pure""
quantum gravity can never consistently be extended.

formation of the observed clumps requires initial disks of gas and stars with
almost no stabilizing bulge or stellar halo. This cannot be achieved in models
where disk galaxies grow by mergers. Mergers tend to make stellar spheroids

of galaxies and larger, again thrusts onto astrophysics the opportunity and the
responsibility to confront the age old mystery ""What is the nature of matter?""
By deriving basic data on the nature of DM - e.g., mass of its particle(s),
present mean temperature, distribution in galaxies and other structures in the
universe, and capacity for dissipational collapse - we will be uncovering the
properties of the dominant species of matter in the universe and significantly
extending the standard models of particle physics. Determining the mass of the
DM particle to an order of magnitude would help to sort out the particle family
to which it (or they) belongs. Beyond mass, there are issues of stability. The
DM particle may be unstable with a measurable half-life, or it may become
unstable after absorbing a certain amount of energy from collisions. In both
cases it would contribute to the present hot dark matter component.
  Some key parameters of DM can most accurately be measured in the very nearby
universe because DM dominates the mass in the outer Milky Way (MW), in other
galaxies in the Local Group, and in the Local Group in its entirety. The
presence and amount of DM can be quantified by study of dynamical processes
observable in fine detail within these entities. Precise measurements of 3-D
velocities for stars, coherent star streams, and stars in satellite stellar
systems out to the edge of the Galaxy can reveal ""what is the shape,
orientation, density law, and lumpiness of the dark matter halo"" as well as
""what is the total mass of the Galaxy?""

to the Intergalactic Medium? Starburst galaxies drive galactic-scale outflows
or ""superwinds"" that may be responsible for removing metals from galaxies and
polluting the Intergalactic Medium (IGM). In the last decade tremendous
progress was made in mapping cool entrained gas in superwinds through
UV/optical imaging and absorption line spectroscopy. These studies demonstrated
that superwinds are ubiquitous in galaxies forming stars at high surface
densities and that the most powerful starbursts can drive outflows near escape
velocity. Theoretical models of galaxy evolution have begun to incorporate
superwinds, using various ad-hoc prescriptions based on our knowledge of the
cool gas. However, these efforts are fundamentally impeded by our lack of
information about the hot phase of these outflows. The hot X-ray emitting phase
of a superwind contains the majority of its energy and newly-synthesized
metals, and given its high specific energy and inefficient cooling it is also
the component most likely escape from the galaxy's gravitational potential
well. Knowledge of the chemical composition and velocity of the hot gas are
crucial to assess the energy and chemical feedback from a starburst. A high
priority for the next decade is to enable direct measurements to be made of the
rates at which starburst galaxies of all masses eject gas, metals, and energy
into the IGM. This will require a high sensitivity X-ray imaging spectrometer
capable of measuring velocities in faint diffuse X-ray emission with a velocity
accuracy of ~ 100 km/s. Such spectral resolution automatically allows detailed
line-based plasma diagnostics, and thus composition, energetics and flow rates
can be derived.

formation has earned its status as a paradigm by explaining the distribution of
matter over large spans of cosmic distance and time. However, its central
tenet, that most of the matter in the universe is dark and exotic, is still
unproven; the dark matter hypothesis is sufficiently audacious as to continue
to warrant a diverse battery of tests. While local searches for dark matter
particles or their annihilation signals could prove the existence of the
substance itself, studies of cosmological dark matter in situ are vital to
fully understand its role in structure formation and evolution. We argue that
gravitational lensing provides the cleanest and farthest-reaching probe of dark
matter in the universe, which can be combined with other observational
techniques to answer the most challenging and exciting questions that will
drive the subject in the next decade: What is the distribution of mass on
sub-galactic scales? How do galaxy disks form and bulges grow in dark matter
halos? How accurate are CDM predictions of halo structure? Can we distinguish
between a need for a new substance (dark matter) and a need for new physics
(departures from General Relativity)? What is the dark matter made of anyway?
We propose that the central tool in this program should be a wide-field optical
imaging survey, whose true value is realized with support in the form of
high-resolution, cadenced optical/infra-red imaging, and massive-throughput
optical spectroscopy.

against uncertainties in those returns is aided by the use of utility
functions. The Kelly criterion offers another approach, rooted in information
theory, that always implies logarithmic utility. The two approaches seem
incompatible, too loosely or too tightly constraining investors' risk
preferences, from their respective perspectives. The conflict can be understood
on the basis that the multiplicative models used in both approaches are
non-ergodic which leads to ensemble-average returns differing from time-average
returns in single realizations. The classic treatments, from the very beginning
of probability theory, use ensemble-averages, whereas the Kelly-result is
obtained by considering time-averages. Maximizing the time-average growth rates
for an investment defines an optimal leverage, whereas growth rates derived
from ensemble-average returns depend linearly on leverage. The latter measure
can thus incentivize investors to maximize leverage, which is detrimental to
time-average growth and overall market stability. The Sharpe ratio is
insensitive to leverage. Its relation to optimal leverage is discussed. A
better understanding of the significance of time-irreversibility and
non-ergodicity and the resulting bounds on leverage may help policy makers in
reshaping financial risk controls.

that span the full range of galaxy morphologies, while also enabling the study
of the more crowded regions of relatively nearby galaxies. With such

the accuracy of optical functions ($n$ and $k$) from the infrared (IR) to the
ultraviolet (UV). Comparison with previous $\lambda \sim$ 6--20 $\mu$m
thin-film spectra constrains the thickness of the films and verifies that
recent IR reflectivity data provide correct values for $k$ in the IR region. We
extract $n$ and $k$ needed for radiative transfer models using a new
``difference method'', which utilizes transmission spectra measured from two
SiC single-crystals with different thicknesses. This method is ideal for
near-IR to visible regions where absorbance and reflectance are low and can be
applied to any material. Comparing our results with previous UV measurements of
SiC, we distinguish between chemical and structural effects at high frequency.
We find that for all spectral regions, 3C ($\beta$-SiC) and the $\vec{E}\bot
\vec{c}$ polarization of 6H (a type of $\alpha$-SiC) have almost identical
optical functions that can be substituted for each other in modeling
astronomical environments. Optical functions for $\vec{E} \| \vec{c}$ of 6H SiC
have peaks shifted to lower frequency, permitting identification of this
structure below $\lambda \sim4\mu$m. The onset of strong UV absorption for pure
SiC occurs near 0.2 $\mu$m, but the presence of impurities redshifts the rise
to 0.33 $\mu$m. Optical functions are similarly impacted. Such large
differences in spectral characteristics due to structural and chemical effects
should be observable and provide a means to distinguish chemical variation of
SiC dust in space.

interiors of young planets look like, and does the mass-luminosity relation of
young planets more closely resemble the ""hot start"" or ""cold start"" models? To
address these questions, we recommend investment in high-resolution NIR

pathfinder surveys for directly-imaged young exoplanets, and continued

sensitivity of a ground-based microlensing survey is limited to the vicinity of

phase at 1.2 keV. The observed phase shift and modulation are likely the result
of emission from opposing thermal hot spots of distinct temperatures.

resonance effect similar to that seen in the spectrum of the CCO pulsar 1E

months, with a 2 sigma upper limit on the period derivative less than 8.3E-15.

erg/s, the surface magnetic dipole field strength B_s < 9.8E11 G, and the
spin-down age tau > 220 kyr. The latter is much longer than the SNR age,
indicating that PSR J0821-4300 was born spinning near its present period. Its
properties are remarkably similar to those of the two other known CCO pulsars,
demonstrating the existence of a class of neutron stars born with weak magnetic

recycling paths is via stellar mass-loss. All stars exhibit mass loss with
rates ranging from ~10(-14) to 10(-4) M(sun) yr-1, depending on spectral type,
luminosity class, rotation rate, companion proximity, and evolutionary stage.
The first generation of stars consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium. These
shed material - via massive winds, planetary nebulae and supernova explosions -
seeding the interstellar medium with heavier elements. Subsequent generations
of stars incorporated this material, changing how stars burn and providing
material for planet formation. An understanding of mass loss is critical for
modeling individual stars as well as answering larger astrophysical questions.
Understanding mass loss is essential for following the evolution of single
stars, binaries, star clusters, and galaxies. Mass loss is one of our weakest
areas in the modeling of fundamental stellar processes. In large part this is
owing to lack of confrontation with detailed observations of stellar
photospheres and the mass-loss process. High resolution optical imagery with
telescope arrays is beginning to provide these data and, combined with
spectroscopy and broad infrared and sub-mm coverage, supporting more
sophisticated models on fast computers and promising a new era in mass-loss
studies.

(sensors, chips, fibres, etc), and, thus, opens up new horizon for their
applications. Nevertheless, the efficiency most of them is still based on the
fundamental physical phenomena, such as resonances. Thus, the understanding of
the resonance phenomena will be beneficial. One of the well-known examples is
the resonant enhancement of the transmission known as Breit-Wigner resonances,
which can be described by a Lorentzian function. But, in many physical systems
the scattering of waves involves propagation along different paths, and, as a
consequence, results in interference phenomena, where constructive interference
corresponds to resonant enhancement and destructive interference to resonant
suppression of the transmission. Recently, a variety of experimental and
theoretical work has revealed such patterns in different branches of physics.
The purpose of this Review is to demonstrate that this kind of resonant
scattering is related to the Fano resonances, known from atomic physics. One of
the main features of the Fano resonances is the asymmetric profile. The
asymmetry comes from the close coexistence of resonant transmission and
resonant reflection. Fano successfully explained such a phenomenon in his
seminal paper in 1961 in terms of interaction of a discrete (localized) state
with a continuum of propagation modes. It allows to describe both resonant
enhancement and resonant suppression in a unified manner. All of these
properties can be demonstrated in the frame of a very simple model, which will
be used throughout the Review to show that resonant reflections observed in
different complex systems are indeed closely related to the Fano resonances.

cluster was created making appear its mass out of nothing, rather than from
mass already present in the galaxy. Here we use a thought experiment, plus a
few simple computations, to show that the difference between the dynamical
effects of these two scenarios (i.e., mass creation vs. mass concentration) is
actually very important. We also present the results of new numerical
experiments, simulating the formation of the cluster through mass
concentration, that show that trapping depends critically on the process of
cluster formation and that the amounts of gained mass are substantially smaller
than those obtained from mass creation.

JANUS (Joint Astrophysics Nascent Universe Satellite), EXIST (Energetic X-ray

Extremisation of $H$ or $D$, subject to any constraints, thus selects the ""most

asymptotically (for number of entities $N \back \to \back \infty$) to the

$\mathbb{W}$ or $\mathbb{P}$ is not multinomial and/or does not satisfy an

$H_{Sh}$, but can be analysed directly by MaxProb. This study reviews several
examples, including (a) non-asymptotic systems; (b) systems with

interface, strong parity-mixing of Cooper pairs between a spin-singlet state
and a spin-triplet state occurs in this system. There are also strong
inter-band pair correlations between the spin-orbit split bands, in spite of
the considerably large spin-orbit splitting. This is due to frustration between
the spin-orbit interaction and pairing interactions. In this pairing state,
time-reversal symmetry is restored, in contrast to the bulk Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ which

determined by the many-body bath evolution. The bath dynamics can start either
from a pure state or, more generally, from a statistical ensemble. In the
preceding article [W. Yang and R. B. Liu, Phys. Rev. B \textbf{78}, 085315
(2008)], we have developed the cluster-correlation expansion (CCE) theory for
the so-called single-sample bath dynamics initiated from a factorizable pure
state. Here we present the ensemble CCE theory, which is based on similar ideas
of the single-sample CCE: The bath evolution is factorized into the product of
all possible cluster correlations, each of which accounts for the authentic
(non-factorizable) collective excitation of a group of bath spins, and for the
finite-time evolution in the qubit decoherence problem, convergent results can
be obtained by truncating the ensemble CCE by keeping cluster correlations up
to a certain size. A difference between the ensemble CCE and single-sample CCE
is that the mean-field treatment in the latter formalism of the diagonal part
of the spin-spin interaction in the bath is not possible in the former case.
The ensemble CCE can be applied to non-factorizable initial states. The
ensemble CCE is checked against the exact solution of an XY spin bath model.
For small spin baths, it is shown that single-sample dynamics is sensitive to
the sampling of the initial state from a thermal ensemble and hence very
different from the ensemble average.

to formulate a simpler matrix difference equation which leads to large

free-ion electron states in the axial crystal-fields and the second moment of
that splitting $\sigma^{2}$ is thoroughly investigated. The non-Kramers and
Kramers states with the quantum number $1\leq J \leq 8$ in the axial
crystal-fields of any multipolar composition but fixed $\sigma^{2}$ are
considered. Since the crystal-field Hamiltonian ${\cal H}_{\rm CF}$ is a
superposition of the three effective multipoles various $\Delta E$ can
correspond to a fixed $\sigma^{2}$ according to the resultant combination of
the independent contributions. This $\Delta E$ variation range is the subject
of the study. For the states under examination $\Delta E$ can take the values
from $2.00\sigma$ to $3.75\sigma$, whereas the difference $\Delta E_{max}-
\Delta E_{min}$, except the states with $J\leq 5/2$, amounts roughly to
$\sigma$. For comparison, the one-multipolar ${\cal H}_{\rm CF}$s yield
accurately defined $\Delta E$ ranging from $2.50\sigma$ to $3.00\sigma$. The
limitations of the allowed $\Delta E$ values exclude rigorously a number of
virtually possible splitting diagrams. The documentary evidence for this
restriction has been supplied in the paper collating the nominally admissible
total energy splittings $\Delta {\cal E}$ (i.e. those preserving the
$\sigma^{2}$) with the $(\Delta E_{min}, \Delta E_{max})$ ranges occurring in
the actual axial crystal-fields. Although the $\Delta E$ unlike the
$\sigma^{2}$ is not an essential characteristic and depends on the reference
frame orientation, it is useful to know its dispersion range, particularly
attempting to assign or verify complex electron spectra.

that ancestry queries between any two nodes in a tree can be answered just by
looking at their corresponding labels. The common measure to evaluate the
quality of an ancestry labeling scheme is by its {\em label size}, that is the
maximal number of bits stored in a label, taken over all $n$-node trees. The
design of ancestry labeling schemes finds applications in XML search engines.
In the context of these applications, even small improvements in the label size
are important. In fact, the literature about this topic is interested in the
exact label size rather than just its order of magnitude. As a result,
following the proposal of an original scheme of size $2\log n$ bits, a
considerable amount of work was devoted to improve the bound on the label size.
The current state of the art upper bound is $\log n + O(\sqrt{\log n})$ bits
which is still far from the known $\log n + \Omega(\log\log n)$ lower bound.
Moreover, the hidden constant factor in the additive $O(\sqrt{\log n})$ term is
large, which makes this term dominate the label size for typical current XML
trees.
  In attempt to provide good performances for real XML data, we rely on the
observation that the depth of a typical XML tree is bounded from above by a
small constant. Having this in mind, we present an ancestry labeling scheme of
size $\log n+2\log d +O(1)$, for the family of trees with at most $n$ nodes and
depth at most $d$. In addition to our main result, we prove a result that may
be of independent interest concerning the existence of a linear {\em universal
graph} for the family of forests with trees of bounded depth.

(the volume fraction of material) of $\phi_0=0.15$. The aggregates were put
onto a vibrating baseplate and, thus, performed multiple collisions with the
plate at a mean velocity of 0.2 m s$^{-1}$. The dust aggregates were observed
by a high-speed camera to measure their size which apparently decreased over
time as a measure for their compaction. After 1000 collisions the volume
filling factor was increased by a factor of two, while after $\sim2000$

function and extremely fast. The method works unattended for probability
densities with discontinuities (jumps and poles). The setup time is short,

approximation to be employed in Monte Carlo computations of radiative transfer
in dusty media of massive circumstellar disks. The aim is to improve the
accuracy of the computed temperature structure and to decrease the computation
time. The accuracy, efficiency and applicability of the methods in various
corners of parameter space are investigated. The effects of using these methods
on the vertical structure of the circumstellar disk as obtained from
hydrostatic equilibrium computations are also addressed. Two methods are
presented. First, an energy diffusion approximation is used to improve the
accuracy of the temperature structure in highly obscured regions of the disk,
where photon counts are low. Second, a modified random walk approximation is
employed to decrease the computation time. This modified random walk ensures
that the photons that end up in the high-density regions can quickly escape to
the lower density regions, while the energy deposited by these photons in the
disk is still computed accurately. A new radiative transfer code, MCMax, is
presented in which both these diffusion approximations are implemented. These
can be used simultaneously to increase both computational speed and decrease
statistical noise. We conclude that the diffusion approximations allow for fast
and accurate computations of the temperature structure, vertical disk structure
and observables of very optically thick circumstellar disks.

give several upper bounds for the order of $A \setminus X$ in function of the
order $h$ of $A$ and some parameters related to $X$ and $A$. If the parameter
in question is the cardinality of $X$, Nathanson and Nash already obtained some
of such upper bounds, which can be seen as polynomials in $h$ with degree $(|X|
+ 1)$. Here, by taking instead of the cardinality of $X$ the parameter defined
by $d := \frac{\diam(X)}{\gcd\{x - y | x, y \in X\}}$, we show that the order
of $A \setminus X$ is bounded above by $(\frac{h (h + 3)}{2} + d \frac{h (h -
1) (h + 4)}{6})$. As a consequence, we deduce that if $X$ is an arithmetic
progression of length $\geq 3$, then the upper bounds of Nathanson and Nash are
considerably improved. Further, by considering more complex parameters related
to both $X$ and $A$, we get upper bounds which are polynomials in $h$ with
degree only 2.

has been surveyed in the J, H and Ks bands with the IRSF telescope and the
SIRIUS camera whose filters are similar to the Mauna Kea Observatories (MKO)
near-infrared photometric system. Combined with the GLIMPSE II point source
catalog, we made Ks versus (Ks - lambda) color-magnitude diagrams where lambda
= 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 micron. The Ks magnitudes of bulge red clump stars and
the (Ks - lambda) colors of red giant branches are used as a tracer of the
reddening vector in the color-magnitude diagrams. From these magnitudes and
colors, we have obtained the ratios of total to selective extinction
A(Ks)/E(Ks-lambda) for the four IRAC bands. Combined with A(lambda)/A(Ks) for
the J and H bands derived by Nishiyama et al., we obtain
A(J):A(H):A(Ks):A([3.6]):A([4.5]):A([5.8]):A([8.0])=3.02:1.73:1:0.50:0.39:0.36:0.43

extinction curve at lambda > 3 micron from a simple extrapolation of the
power-law extinction at shorter wavelengths, in accordance with recent studies.
The extinction law in the 2MASS JHKs bands has also been calculated, and a good
agreement with that in the MKO system is found. In nearby molecular clouds and
diffuse interstellar medium, the lack of reliable measurements of the total to
selective extinction ratios hampers unambiguous determination of the extinction
law; however, observational results toward these lines of sight cannot be
reconciled with a single extinction law.

modern astrophysics. We model the core collapse dynamics of massive progenitor
stars with high surface magnetic fields in the theoretical framework of a
self-similar general polytropic magnetofluid under the self-gravity with a
quasi-spherical symmetry. With the specification of physical parameters such as
mass density, temperature, magnetic field and wind mass loss rate on the
progenitor stellar surface and the consideration of a rebound shock breaking
through the stellar interior and envelope, we find a remnant compact object
(i.e. neutron star) left behind at the centre with a radius of $\sim 10^6$ cm
and a mass range of $\sim 1-3$ solar masses. Moreover, we find that surface
magnetic fields of such kind of compact objects can be $\sim 10^{14}-10^{15}$
G, consistent with those inferred for magnetars which include soft gamma-ray
repeaters (SGRs) and anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs). The magnetic field
enhancement factor critically depends on the self-similar scaling index $n$,
which also determines the initial density distribution of the massive
progenitor. We propose that magnetized massive stars as magnetar progenitors
based on the magnetohydrodynamic evolution of the gravitational core collapse
and rebound shock. Our physical mechanism, which does not necessarily require
ad hoc dynamo amplification within a fast spinning neutron star, favours the
`fossil field' scenario of forming magnetars from the strongly magnetized core
collapse inside massive progenitor stars. With a range of surface magnetic
field strengths over massive progenitor stars, our scenario allows a continuum
of magnetic field strengths from pulsars to magnetars.

longitudinal magnetic anisotropy DS_z^2, and the transverse magnetic anisotropy
E(S_x^2-S_y^2). In the spin-1/2 model with the XXZ exchange coupling anisotropy

unequal magnitudes with further differences between x and y directions in the

interpretation is that the splitting is larger in magnetically soft directions.
The magnitude of the splitting is directly related to the energy differences
between spin states and it is only weakly modified by some multiplicative
factor due to Kondo screening. The results for the S=3/2 model are in good

Froissart theorem, and in the huge range of energy this cross section is
proportional to $s^{1/3}$. The graviton reggeization will change this increase
to the normal logarithmic behaviour $\sigma \propto \ln^2 s$. However, we
demonstrated that this happens at ultra high energy, much higher than the LHC
energy. In the region of accessible energy we need to assume that there is a
different source for the total cross section, with the value of the cross
section about 40 mb. With this assumption we successfully describe
$\sigma_{tot}, \sigma_{el}$ and $\sigma_{diff}$ for the accessible range of
energy from the fixed target Fermilab to the Tevatron energies. It turns out
that the N=4 SYM mechanism can be responsible only for a small part of the
inelastic cross section for this energy region (about $2 mb$). However, at the
LHC energy the N=4 SYM theory can describe the multipartticle production with
$\sigma_{in} \approx 28 mb$. The second surprise is the fact that the total
cross section and the diffraction cross section can increase considerably from
the Tevatron to the LHC energy. The bad description of $B_{el}$ gives the
strong argument that the non N=4 SYM background should depend on energy. We
believe that we have a dilemma: to find a new mechanism for the inelastic
production in the framework of N=4 SYM other than the reggeized graviton
interaction, or to accept that N=4 SYM is irrelevant to any experimental data

Logarithmic discretization has arbitrary high resolution around some chosen

(Kondo model), where the continuum of the conduction band states needs to be
reduced to a finite number of levels with good sampling near the Fermi level.
The discretization schemes under discussion are required to reproduce the
original function after averaging over different interleaved discretization
meshes, thus systematic deviations which appear in the conventional logarithmic
discretization are eliminated. An improved scheme is proposed in which the
discretization-mesh points themselves are determined in an adaptive way; they
are denser in the regions where the function has higher values. Such schemes
help in reducing the residual numeric artefacts in NRG calculations in
situations where the density of states approaches zero over extended intervals.

Entanglement can be extended to long distances by applying successive

rates that are achievable with the best known schemes based on atomic ensemble
memories and linear optics. The main reason is that for trapped ions the
entanglement swapping operations are performed deterministically, in contrast
to success probabilities below 50 percent per swapping with linear optics. The
scheme requires efficient collection of the emitted photons, which can be
achieved with cavities, and efficient conversion of their wavelength, which can

semi-analytical galaxy formation model. We study the existing forms of the mass
functions in the literature and compare their predictions for semi-analytical
galaxy formation models. Two methods are used in the literature to compute the
net formation rate of halos, one by simply taking the derivative of the halo
mass function and the other using the prescription due to Sasaki (1994). For
the Press-Schechter (PS) mass function, we compare various model predictions,
using these two methods. However, as the Sasaki formalism cannot be easily
generalized for other mass functions, we use the derivative while comparing
model predictions of different mass functions. We show that the reionization
history and UV luminosity function of Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) predicted by
the PS mass function differs from those using any other existing mass function,
like Sheth-Tormen (ST) mass function.In particular the reionization efficiency
of molecular cooled halos has to be substantially reduced when one uses the ST
and other mass functions obtained from the simulation instead of the PS mass
function. Using $\chi^2$-minimization, we find that the observed UV luminosity
functions of LBGs at $3.0\le z\le 7.4$ are better reproduced by models using
the ST mass function compared to models that use the PS mass function. On the
other hand, the volume filling factor of the metals expelled from the galaxies
through supernovae driven outflows differs very little between models with
different mass functions. It depends on the way we treat merging outflows. We
also show that the porosity weighted average quantities related to the outflow
are not very sensitive to the differences in the halo mass function.

diffusion (GRD) model to investigate the traffic fluctuation in weighted
networks, where a random walk's choice of route is affected not only by the
number of links a node has, but also by the weight of individual links. We
obtain analytical solutions that characterise the relation between the average
traffic and the fluctuation through nodes and links. Our analysis is supported
by the results of numerical simulations. We observe that the value ranges of
the average traffic and the fluctuation, through nodes or links, increase
dramatically with the level of heterogeneity in link weight. This highlights
the key role that link weight plays in traffic fluctuation and the necessity to
study traffic fluctuation on weighted networks.

the background cosmology in this model can mimic that of a LCDM Universe to
high precision. However, as the cosmic expansion goes through the

are rapidly damped out. We show that,although this does not significantly
affect structure formation in baryonic matter, it makes the gravitational
potential decay rapidly at late times, leading to modifications in predictions

ferromagnetic materials. Barkhausen noise (BN) is generated by the
discontinuous motion of magnetic domains as they interact with impurities and
defects. BN is one of the many examples of crackling noise, arising in a
variety of contexts with remarkably similar features, and occurring when a
system responds in a jerky manner to a smooth external forcing. Among all
crackling system, we focus on BN, where a complete and consistent picture
emerges thanks to an exactly solvable model of avalanche dynamics, known as the
ABBM model, which ultimately describes the system in terms of a Langevin
equation for the velocity of the avalanche front. Despite its simplicity, the
ABBM model is able to accurately reproduce the phenomenology observed in the
experiments on a large class of magnetic materials, as long as universal
properties are involved. To complete the picture and to understand the
long-standing discrepancy between the ABBM theory and the experiments, which
otherwise agree exceptionally well, consisting of the puzzling asymmetric shape
of the noise pulses, microscopic details must be taken into account, namely the
effects of eddy current retardation. These effects can be incorporated in the
model, and result, to a first-order approximation, in a negative effective mass
associated with the wall. The progress made in understanding BN is potentially
relevant for other crackling systems: on the one hand, the ABBM model turns out
to be a paradigmatic model for the universal behaviour of avalanche dynamics;
on the other hand, the microscopic explanation of the asymmetry in the noise
pulses suggests that inertial effects may also be at the origin of pulses
asymmetry observed in other crackling systems.

spicules can reach heights of 8 Mm above the limb. We show that spicules
outside the limb continue as dark fibrils inside the disc.

membership problem, a classical problem closely related to basic questions in
quantum computing. Here Alice receives, as input, a subgroup $H$ of a finite
group $G$; Bob receives an element $x \in G$. Alice is permitted to send a
single message to Bob, after which he must decide if his input $x$ is an
element of $H$. We prove the following upper bounds on the classical
communication complexity of this problem in the bounded-error setting: (1) The
problem can be solved with $O(\log |G|)$ communication, provided the subgroup
$H$ is normal; (2) The problem can be solved with $O(d_{\max} \cdot \log |G|)$
communication, where $d_{\max}$ is the maximum of the dimensions of the
irreducible complex representations of $G$; (3) For any prime $p$ not dividing
$|G|$, the problem can be solved with $O(d_{\max} \cdot \log p)$ communication,
where $d_{\max}$ is the maximum of the dimensions of the irreducible
$\F_p$-representations of $G$.

the additive group of integers has generating sets {a^i}_{i=0}^{\infty} and
{b^j}_{j=0}^{\infty} with associated metrics d_A and d_B, respectively. It is
proved that these metrics are bi-Lipschitz equivalent if and only if there

to explain--on an abstract but hopefully sufficiently descriptive level--why we
believe that future progress in the field is to result from human-orientedness
and descente infinie.

impossibility of defining Lorentz-invariant elements of reality. Here I revisit
that question, and bring a number of additional considerations to it. I will
first analyze Hardy's argument, which was meant to show that Lorentz-invariant
elements of reality are indeed inconsistent with quantum mechanics. I will then
investigate to what extent the light cone associated with an event can be used
to define Lorentz-invariant elements of reality. It turns out to be possible,
but elements of reality associated with a product of two commuting operators
will not always be equal to the product of elements of reality associated with
each operator. I will finally examine a number of ways in which the paradoxical
features of Hardy's experiment can be better understood.
