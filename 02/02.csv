for 144 T Tauri stars in the young (~2 Myr old) Chamaeleon I and Taurus-Auriga
star forming regions based on multi-epoch high-resolution optical spectra from
the Magellan Clay 6.5 m telescope supplemented by mid-infared photometry from
the Spitzer Space Telescope. In contrast to previous studies in the Orion
Nebula Cluster and NGC 2264, we do not see a clear signature of disk braking in
Tau-Aur and Cha I. We find that both accretors and non-accretors have similar
distributions of v sin i. The rotational velocities in both regions show a
clear mass dependence, with F--K stars rotating on average about twice as fast
as M stars, consistent with results reported for other clusters of similar age.
Similarly, we find the upper envelope of the observed values of specific
angular momentum j varies as M^0.5 for our sample which spans a mass range of
~0.16 to ~3 M_sun. This power law complements previous studies in Orion which
estimated j is proportional to M^0.25 for < ~2 Myr stars in the same mass
regime, and a sharp decline in j with decreasing mass for older stars (~10 Myr)
with M < 2 M_sun. For a subsample of 67 objects with mid-IR photometry, we
examine the connection between accretion signatures and dusty disks: in the
vast majority of cases (63/67), the two properties correlate well, which
suggests that the timescale of gas accretion is similar to the lifetime of
inner disks.

model (MSSM), where the fine tuning in the Higgs mass parameters is highly
reduced. The Higgs boson is insensitive to high energies because of
supersymmetry and also because it is a pseudo-Goldstone boson of a global
symmetry (referred to as double protection or super-little Higgs mechanism). A
large shift in the Higgs quartic self coupling is obtained via a non-decoupling
D-term coming from an extra gauge group, resulting in a Higgs that can be as
heavy as 135 GeV with a tuning milder than 10%. With an appropriate choice of
quantum numbers one can achieve that the additional quartic is generated
without a corresponding shift in the Higgs mass, thus preserving the double
protection of the Higgs. The model predicts the existence of several
top-partner fermions one of which can be as light as 700 GeV, while the
ordinary MSSM states could be as light as 400 GeV. In addition to many new
particles in the multi-TeV range there would also be an axion-like state very
weakly coupled to standard model (SM) matter which could be in the sub-GeV
regime, and sterile neutrinos which could be light.

flattening at large distance instead of the Keplerian fall) requires that this
matter is distributed in an extended halo around the galaxy. In order to
reproduce this matter density profiles in Newtonian gravity and in cold dark
matter (CDM) paradigm (in which the DM particles are collisionless), many

explained by a suitable modification of gravitational force in bigravity

want to study moment closure generally within the framework of optimal

smaller system, for radiation moment systems. We apply this strategy to
radiative transfer and show that several closures can be re-derived within this

addition, the formalism gives rise to new parabolic systems, the reordered

temperature all the undoped materials exhibit universal behavior, where a
tetragonal-to-orthorhombic/monoclinic structural transition occurs, below which
the systems become antiferromagnets. For the first two classes of materials the
magnetic structure within the a-b plane consists of chains of parallel Fe spins
that are coupled antiferromagnetically in the orthogonal direction, with an
ordered moment typically less than one Bohr magneton. Hence these are itinerant
electron magnets, with a spin structure that is consistent with Fermi-surface
nesting and a very energetic spin wave bandwidth ~0.2 eV. With doping, the
structural and magnetic transitions are suppressed in favor of
superconductivity. Magnetic correlations are observed in the superconducting
regime, with a magnetic resonance that follows the superconducting order
parameter just like the cuprates. The rare-earth moments order
antiferromagnetically at low T like conventional magnetic-superconductors.
Pressure in CaFe2As2 transforms the system from a magnetically ordered
orthorhombic material to a collapsed non-magnetic tetragonal system. Tetragonal
Fe1+xTe transforms to a low T monoclinic structure at small x that changes to
orthorhombic at larger x, which is accompanied by a crossover from commensurate
to incommensurate magnetic order. Se doping suppresses the magnetic order.

constant spectral indices of individual ions at the cosmic-ray sources and no

streaming algorithms. In recent years, there has been significant progress in
analysing distributions in a streaming setting, but the progress on graph
problems has been limited. A main reason for this has been the existence of
linear space lower bounds for even simple problems such as determining the
connectedness of a graph. However, in many new scenarios that arise from social
and other interaction networks, the number of vertices is significantly less
than the number of edges. This has led to the formulation of the semi-streaming
model where we assume that the space is (near) linear in the number of vertices
(but not necessarily the edges), and the edges appear in an arbitrary (and
possibly adversarial) order.
  In this paper we focus on graph sparsification, which is one of the major
building blocks in a variety of graph algorithms. There has been a long history
of (non-streaming) sampling algorithms that provide sparse graph approximations
and it a natural question to ask if the sparsification can be achieved using a
small space, and in addition using a single pass over the data? The question is
interesting from the standpoint of both theory and practice and we answer the
question in the affirmative, by providing a one pass
$\tilde{O}(n/\epsilon^{2})$ space algorithm that produces a sparsification that
approximates each cut to a $(1+\epsilon)$ factor. We also show that $\Omega(n
\log \frac1\epsilon)$ space is necessary for a one pass streaming algorithm to
approximate the min-cut, improving upon the $\Omega(n)$ lower bound that arises
from lower bounds for testing connectivity.

field, which has the link Higgs coupling $c_1 SUS$ and the plaquette gauge
coupling $c_2 UUUU$. The randomness is introduced by replacing $c_1 \to -c_1$
for each link with the probability $p_1$ and $c_2 \to -c_2$ for each plaquette
with the probability $p_2$. We calculate the phase diagram by a new kind of
mean field theory that does not assume the replica symmetry and also by Monte
Carlo simulations. For the case $p_1=p_2(\equiv p)$, the Monte Carlo
simulations exhibit that (i) the region of the Higgs phase in the Coulomb-Higgs
transition diminishes as $p$ increases, and (ii) the first-order phase
transition between the Higgs and the confinement phases disappear for $p \ge
p_c \simeq 0.01$. We discuss the implications of the results to the quantum
memory studied by Kitaev et al. and the Z(2) gauge neural network on a lattice.

massive gravity theories where the local Lorentz invariance is broken by the
different coexisting backgrounds. This gives rise to the appropriate mass

the two matter components, ordinary and dark, couple to separate gravitational

repulsive between the ordinary and dark bodies. As a result the distances much
smaller than the Yukawa radius $r_m$ the gravitation strength between the two
types of matter becomes vanishing. If $r_m \sim 10$ kpc, a typical size of a
galaxy, there are interesting implications for the nature of dark matter. In
particular, one can avoid the problem of the cusp that is typical for the cold
dark matter halos. Interestingly, the flat shape of the rotational curves can
be explained even in the case of the collisional and dissipative dark matter
(as e.g. mirror matter) that cannot give the extended halos but instead must
form galactic discs similarly to the visible matter. The observed rotational
curves for the large, medium-size and dwarf galaxies can be nicely reproduced.

coadjoint orbit which is transverse to the moment map produces a symplectic
orbifold. If moreover the points of this coadjoint orbit are regular elements

for torus quotients may be applied to obtain a desingularisation of these

an example for the stabilisation of first-order transition induced by
magnetic-field-cycling. The issues of 'Phase co-existence' and 'meta-stability'

to induce an effective space- and time-dependent density-density interaction

occupied by the superfluid phase in the phase diagram. For the more general
multi-band Bose-Hubbard model, we find that, in addition to the fermion
screening of the boson interactions, the virtual excitations of the bosons to
the higher Bloch bands coupled with the contact interactions with the fermions
result in an effective increase of the boson on-site repulsion. If this
renormalization of the boson on-site potential is dominant over the fermion
screening of the boson interactions, the area of the Mott insulating lobes of
the Bose-Hubbard phase diagram will be enhanced for either sign of the

scattering that gives rise to gravitational momentum flux. Earth-Human,
Moon-Human, and Earth-Moon gravitational systems were investigated to solve for
the wavelength of photons that comprise the graviton. The calculated wavelength
for each system was approximately equal to the predicted value of the Planck
length, which is interpreted as evidence that gravitons may be formed as fused
four dimensional photons. The results corroborate current thinking about the
temperature at which gravity separated from a unified force during the Big
Bang, while explaining the weakness of the gravitational force from the atomic
to the sub-planetary scale. Extension of the model produces unique, testable
predictions arising from the averaged quantum properties of the graviton as

motivation for the development of a theory of Quantum Gravity. If - so a
typical argumentation - QM gives a universally valid basis for the description
of all natural systems, then the gravitational field should have quantum
properties. Together with the arguments against semi-classical theories of
gravity, this leads to a strategy which takes a quantization of GR as the
natural avenue to Quantum Gravity. And a quantization of the gravitational
field would in some sense correspond to a quantization of geometry. Spacetime
would have quantum properties. But, this strategy will only be successful, if
gravity is a fundamental interaction. - What, if gravity is instead an
intrinsically classical phenomenon? Then, if QM is nevertheless fundamentally
valid, gravity can not be a fundamental interaction. An intrinsically classical
gravity in a quantum world would have to be an emergent, induced or residual,
macroscopic effect, caused by other interactions. The gravitational field (as
well as spacetime) would not have any quantum properties. A quantization of GR
would lead to artifacts without any relation to nature. The serious problems of
all approaches to Quantum Gravity that start from a direct quantization of GR
or try to capture the quantum properties of gravity in form of a 'graviton'
dynamics - together with the, meanwhile, rich spectrum of approaches to an
emergent gravity and/or spacetime - make this latter option more and more
interesting for the development of a theory of Quantum Gravity. The most

those of adjacent paleopolar deposits by 5-10 degrees. We test the hypothesis
that the offset is the result of true polar wander (TPW), the motion of the
solid surface with respect to the spin axis, caused by a mass redistribution
within or on the surface of Mars. In particular, we consider TPW driven by
late-stage volcanism during the late Hesperian to Amazonian. There is
observational and qualitative support for this hypothesis: in both North and
South, observed offsets lie close to a great circle 90 degrees from Tharsis, as
expected for polar wander after Tharsis formed. We calculate the magnitude and
direction of TPW produced by mapped late-stage lavas for a range of
lithospheric thicknesses, lava thicknesses, eruption histories, and prior polar
wander events. If Tharsis formed close to the equator, the stabilizing effect
of a fossil rotational bulge located close to the equator leads to predicted
TPW of <2 degrees, too small to account for observed offsets. If, however,
Tharsis formed far from the equator, late-stage TPW driven by low-latitude,
late-stage volcanism would be 6-33 degrees, similar to that inferred from the
location of paleopolar deposits. 4.4+/-1.3x10^19 kg of young erupted lava can
account for the offset of the Dorsa Argentea Formation from the present-day
south rotation pole. This mass is consistent with prior mapping-based estimates
and would imply a mass release of CO2 by volcanic degassing similar to that in
the atmosphere at the present time. The South Polar Layered Deposits are offset
from the spin axis in the opposite sense to the other paleopolar deposits. This
can be explained by an additional contribution from a plume beneath Elysium. We
conclude with a list of observational tests of the TPW hypothesis.

the macroscopic dynamics are solved by using CFD, but, instead of using any
constitutive equations, a local stress is calculated by using a non-equilibrium
MD simulation associated at each lattice node in the CFD calculation. It is
seen that the local rheology of the melt varies considerably in a thin viscous
diffusion layer that arises near an oscillating plate. It is also found that
the local rheology of the melt is divided into the three different regimes,
i.e., the viscous fluid, viscoelastic liquid, and viscoelastic solid regimes,
according to the local Deborah number $De$, which is defined with the Rouse or

established in statistical signal processing but not, until recently, extended
to computer vision as a source of frequency-domain invariants. Recent papers on
using the bispectrum in vision show good results when the bispectrum is applied
to spherical harmonic models of three-dimensional (3-D) shapes, in particular
by improving discrimination over previously-proposed magnitude invariants, and
also by allowing detection of neutral pose in human activity detection. The
bispectrum has also been formulated for vector spherical harmonics, which have
been used in medical imaging for 3-D anatomical modeling. In a paper published
in this journal, Smach {\it et al.} use duality theory to establish the
completeness of second-order invariants which, as shown here, are the same as
the bispectrum. This paper unifies earlier works of various researchers by
deriving the bispectrum formula for all compact groups. It also provides a
constructive algorithm for recovering functions from their bispectral values on
SO(3). The main theoretical result shows that the bispectrum serves as a
complete source of invariants for homogeneous spaces of compact groups,
including such important domains as the sphere $S^2$.

the thermopower in the variable range hopping regime. In 1969, Cutler and Mott
have predicted a linear variation with temperature T of the thermopower: S =
const.T. In the seventies, it has beenfound by Zvyagin, Overhof and Mott that S
= const.T(1/2). In 1986, Triberis and Friedman have found S = const.T^(-1/4) .
But there is up to now no theoretical formulation of the thermopower when this
one is T-independent. By choosing a specific distribution for the density of
states, we show in this paper that all behaviours above can be unified in a
unique thermopower formula. We find in addition with this formula, a
T-independent expression given by: S=(L/xi)(k/e), in which xi is the wave

convexity of this functional over Teichmuller space (due to Wolpert (1987)). We

Magellanic Cloud (SMC), this sightline provides a unique opportunity to probe
the chemical properties and ionization structure in a nearby absorption line
system with a column density of logN(HI) ~ 20.2, at the transition between
Damped Lyman Alpha (DLA) and sub-DLA systems. We find that metallicity of -1.0
< logZ < -0.5 and ionization parameter of -6 < logU < -5 for three
low-ionization components and logU ~ -2.6 for one high-ionization component.
One component at V_sol = 207 km/s shows an alpha-element abundance log(Si/H) ~
-5.0, making it ~ 0.2 dex more metal rich than both SMC H II regions and stars
within the MB and the SMC. The N/Si ratio in this component is log(N/Si) =
-0.3+/-0.1, making it comparable to other N-poor dwarf galaxies and ~ 0.2 dex
lower than H II regions in the SMC. Another component at V_sol = 236 km/s shows
a similar Si/H ratio but has log(N/Si) = -1.0+/-0.2, indicating a nitrogen
deficiency comparable to that seen in the most N-poor DLA systems. These
differences imply different chemical enrichment histories between components
along the same sightline. Our results suggest that, if these absorbers are
representative some fraction of DLA systems, then 1) DLA systems along single
sight-lines do not necessarily represent the global properties of the absorbing
cloud, and b) the chemical composition within a given DLA cloud may be
inhomogeneous.

present independently but with unequal edge occupation probabilities. The edge
probabilities are moderated by vertex weights, and are such that the degree of

w_i, where w_i denotes the weight of vertex i. We choose the weights such that
the weight of a uniformly chosen vertex converges in distribution to a limiting
random variable W, in which case the proportion of vertices with degree k is
close to the probability that a Poisson random variable with random parameter W

P(W\geq k) is proportional to k^{-(\tau-1)} for some power-law exponent \tau>3,
a property which is then inherited by the asymptotic degree distribution.
  We show that the critical behavior depends sensitively on the properties of
the asymptotic degree distribution moderated by the asymptotic weight

these samples is characterized by large amplitude fluctuations with a large
spatial extension, whose size is only limited by the sample's boundaries. These
fluctuations are quite typical and persistent in the sample's volumes, and they
are detected in two independent regions in the northern and southern galactic
caps. We discuss the relation of the scale-length method to several statistical
quantities, such as counts of galaxies as a function of redshift and apparent
magnitude. We confirm previous results, which have determined by magnitude and
redshift counts that there are fluctuations of about 30% between the southern
and the northern galactic caps and we relate explicitly these counts to
structures in redshift space. We show that the estimation of fluctuation
amplitude normalized to the sample density is biased by systematic effects,
which we discuss in detail. We consider the type of fluctuations predicted by
standard cosmological models of structure formation in the linear regime and,
to study nonlinear clustering, we analyze several samples of mock-galaxy
catalogs generated from the distribution of dark matter in cosmological N-body
simulations. In this way we conclude that the galaxy fluctuations present in
these samples are too large in amplitude and too extended in space to be
compatible with the predictions of the standard models of structure formation.

systems which are not chaotic in the usual sense, but are unpredictable for

bodies connected by hinges in $d$-dimensional space. The generic infinitesimal
rigidity of a body-and-hinge framework has been characterized in terms of the
underlying multigraph independently by Tay and Whiteley as follows: A
multigraph $G$ can be realized as an infinitesimally rigid body-and-hinge
framework by mapping each vertex to a body and each edge to a hinge if and only
if ({d+1 \choose 2}-1)G$ contains ${d+1\choose 2}$ edge-disjoint spanning
trees, where $({d+1 \choose 2}-1)G$ is the graph obtained from $G$ by replacing
each edge by $({d+1\choose 2}-1)$ parallel edges. In 1984 they jointly posed a
question about whether their combinatorial characterization can be further
applied to a nongeneric case. Specifically, they conjectured that $G$ can be
realized as an infinitesimally rigid body-and-hinge framework if and only if
$G$ can be realized as that with the additional ``hinge-coplanar'' property,
i.e., all the hinges incident to each body are contained in a common
hyperplane. This conjecture is called the Molecular Conjecture due to the
equivalence between the infinitesimal rigidity of ``hinge-coplanar''
body-and-hinge frameworks and that of bar-and-joint frameworks derived from
molecules in 3-dimension. In 2-dimensional case this conjecture has been proved
by Jackson and Jord{\'a}n in 2006. In this paper we prove this long standing
conjecture affirmatively for general dimension.

well established that the late-time dynamics of gravitational collapse is
dominated by a power-law decaying tail of the form $Mt^{-(2l+3)}$, where $M$ is
the black-hole mass. It should be emphasized, however, that in a typical
evolution scenario there is a considerable time window in which the signal is
no longer dominated by the black-hole quasinormal modes, but the leading order
power-law tail has not yet taken over. Higher-order terms may have a
considerable contribution to the signal at these intermediate times. It is
therefore of interest to analyze these higher-order corrections to the
leading-order power-law behavior. We show that the higher-order contamination
terms die off at late times as $M^2t^{-4}\ln(t/M)$ for spherical perturbations,
and as $M^2t^{-(2l+4)}\ln^2(t/M)$ for non-spherical $(l\neq0)$ perturbations.
These results imply that the leading-order power-law tail becomes ""pure""

comprehensive of all chemical species (from hydrogen to bismuth). The main
nucleosynthesis site is the thin 13C pocket, which forms in the core-envelope
transition region after each third dredge up episode. The formation of this 13C
pockets is the principal by-product of the introduction of a new algorithm,

the convective envelope: both the physical grounds and the calibration of the

various models reflect the differences in the initial iron-seed content and in
the physical structure of AGB stars belonging to different stellar populations.

the evolution of the physical parameters of the model. We analyzed archival
broad-band BeppoSAX spectra of Cyg X-2. Five broad-band spectra have been newly
extracted according to the source position in the Z-track described in the
colour-colour and colour-intensity diagrams. We have fitted the spectra of the
source with two comptb components. The first one, with bulk parameter delta=0,
dominates the overall source broad-band spectrum and its origin is related to
thermal upscattering (Comptonization) of cold seed photons off warm electrons
in high-opacity enviroment. We attribute the origin of these seed photons to
the part of the disk which illuminates the outer coronal region (transition
layer) located between the accretion disk itself and the neutron star surface.
This thermal component is roughly constant with time and with inferred mass
accretion rate. The second comptb model describes the overall Comptonization
(thermal plus bulk, delta > 0) of hotter seed photons which come from both the
inner transition layer and from the neutron star surface. The appearance of
this component in the colour-colour or hardness-intensity diagram is more
pronounced in the horizontal branch and is progressively disappearing towards
the normal branch, where a pure blackbody spectrum is observed. The spectral
evolution of Cyg X-2 is studied and interpreted in terms of changes in the
innermost environmental conditions of the system, leading to a variable
thermal-bulk Comptonization efficiency.

thin radiative cooling, comprising an inherent thermal instability. The size of
the occurring condensation and evaporation interfaces is determined by the
so-called Field-length, which gives the dimension at which the instability is
significantly damped by thermal conduction. Our aim is to study the relevance
of conduction scale effects in the numerical modelling of a bistable medium and
check the applicability of conventional and alternative adaptive mesh
techniques. The low physical value of the thermal conduction within the ISM
defines a multiscale problem, hence promoting the use of adaptive meshes. We
here introduce a new refinement strategy that applies the Field condition by
Koyama & Inutsuka as a refinement criterion. The described method is very
similar to the Jeans criterion for gravitational instability by Truelove and
efficiently allows to trace the unstable gas situated at the thermal
interfaces. We present test computations that demonstrate the greater accuracy
of the newly proposed refinement criterion in comparison to refinement based on
the local density gradient. Apart from its usefulness as a refinement trigger,
we do not find evidence in favour of the Field criterion as a prerequisite for
numerical stability.

and optical emission from GRB 080319B, which confirm that (i) they occurred
within the same astrophysical source region and (ii) their respective radiation
mechanisms were dynamically coupled. Our results, based upon a new CCF
methodology for determining the time-resolved spectral lag, are summarized as
follows. First, the evolution in the arrival offset of prompt gamma-ray photon
counts between Swift-BAT 15-25 keV and 50-100 keV energy bands (intrinsic
gamma-ray spectral lag) appears to be anti-correlated with the arrival offset
between prompt 15-350 keV gamma-rays and the optical emission observed by
TORTORA (extrinsic optical/gamma-ray spectral lag), thus effectively
partitioning the burst into two main episodes at ~T+28+/-2 sec. Second, the
rise and decline of prompt optical emission at ~T+10+/-1 sec and ~T+50+/-1 sec,
respectively, both coincide with discontinuities in the hard to soft evolution
of the photon index for a power law fit to 15-150 keV Swift-BAT data at
~T+8+/-2 sec and ~T+48+/-1 sec. These spectral energy changes also coincide
with intervals whose time-resolved spectral lag values are consistent with
zero, at ~T+12+/-2 sec and ~T+50+/-2 sec. These results, which are robust
across heuristic permutations of Swift-BAT energy channels and varying temporal
bin resolution, have also been corroborated via independent analysis of
Konus-Wind data. This potential discovery may provide the first observational
evidence for an implicit connection between spectral lags and GRB emission
mechanisms in the context of canonical fireball phenomenology. Future work
includes exploring a subset of bursts with prompt optical emission to probe the
unique or ubiquitous nature of this result.

Wide-Angle Camera clear filters with a central wavelength of 0.611microns and
phase functions from 0.001 to 25 degrees of phase angle in the Narrow-Angle and
Wide-Angle Cameras color filters (from the blue 0.451 microns to the near
infrared 0.752 microns). We characterize the morphology of the phase functions
of different features in the main rings. We find that the shape of the phase
function is accurately represented by a logarithmic model (Bobrov 1970, in
Surfaces and Interiors of Planets and Satellites, Academic, edited by A.
Dollfus). For practical purposes, we also parametrize the phase curves by a
simple linear-by-part model (Lumme and Irvine 1976, Astronomical Journal, 81,
p865), which provides three morphological parameters : the amplitude and the
Half-Width at Half-Maximum (HWHM) of the surge, and the slope S of the
linear-part of the phase function at larger phase angles. Our analysis
demonstrates that all of these parameters show trends with the optical depth of
the rings. These trends imply that the optical depth is a key-element
determining the physical properties which act on the opposition effect.
Wavelength variations of the morphological parameters of the surge show
important trends with the optical depth in the green filter (0.568 microns),
which implies that grain size effects are maximum in this wavelength.

mathematical physics and nonlocal cosmology. By a concept of adelic string one
can unify and simultaneously study various aspects of ordinary and p-adic

instrument in the further investigation of modern string theory. It is
remarkable that for some scalar p-adic strings exist effective Lagrangians,
which are based on real instead of p-adic numbers and describe not only
four-point scattering amplitudes but also all higher ones at the tree level. In
this work, starting from p-adic Lagrangians, we consider some approaches to
construction of effective field Lagrangians for p-adic sector of adelic
strings. It yields Lagrangians for nonlinear and nonlocal scalar field theory,
where spacetime nonlocality is determined by an infinite number of derivatives
contained in the operator-valued Riemann zeta function. Owing to the Riemann
zeta function in the dynamics of these scalar field theories, obtained
Lagrangians are also interesting in themselves.

of soft hadronic physics. Accepting the Regge prediction as solid, it is then

Optical spectroscopy obtained 5 days after the 2007 December outburst shows
evidence of very high ejection velocities (FWHM H$\alpha \simeq 4500$ km
s$^{-1}$). In addition, Swift X-ray data show that M31N 2007-12b is associated
with a Super-Soft Source (SSS) which appeared between 21 and 35 days
post-outburst and turned off between then and day 169. Our analysis implies
that $M_{\rm WD} \ga 1.3 $M$_{\odot}$ in this system. The optical light curve,
spectrum and X-ray behaviour are consistent with those of a recurrent nova.
Hubble Space Telescope observations of the pre-outburst location of M31N
2007-12b reveal the presence of a coincident stellar source with magnitude and
color very similar to the Galactic recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi at quiescence,
where the red giant secondary dominates the emission. We believe that this is
the first occasion on which a nova progenitor system has been identified in
M31. However, the greatest similarities of outburst optical spectrum and SSS
behaviour are with the supposed Galactic recurrent nova V2491 Cygni. A
previously implied association of M31N 2007-12b with nova M31N 1969-08a is
shown to be erroneous and this has important lessons for future searches for
recurrent novae in extragalactic systems. Overall, we show that suitable
complementary X-ray and optical observations can be used not only to identify
recurrent nova candidates in M31, but also to determine subtypes and important
physical parameters of these systems. Prospects are therefore good for
extending studies of recurrent novae into the Local Group with the potential to
explore in more detail such important topics as their proposed link to Type Ia
Supernovae.

It has at most one formula on the right side of sequent, and excludes three
structural inference rules, i.e. contraction, weakening and exchange. (FL' is
based on our investigations of the Gentzen-style natural deduction for
non-commutative substructural logics.) FL' has the same proof strength as the
standard sequent calculus FL (Full Lambek), which is the basic sequent calculus
for all other substructural logics. For the standard FL, we use Ono's
formulation. Although FL' and the standard FL are equivalent, there is a subtle
difference in the left rule of implication. In the standard FL, two parameters
$\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$(resp.), each of which is just an finite sequence of
arbitrary formulas, appear on the left and right side (resp.) of a formula
which is placed on the left side of the sequent on the upper left side of the
left rule $\imply$ (which corresponds to $\imply'$ in FL'). On the other hand,
there is no such parameter on the left side of the sequent on the upper left
side in the left rule for $\imply'$ of FL'. In FL', $\Gamma_1$ is always empty,
and only $\Gamma_2$ is allowed to occur in the left rule for $\imply'$.
(Similar differences occur in multiplicative and additive conjunctions, and in
additive disjunction.) This difference between FL' and FL matters deeply, for
we are led to a construction of proof-figures in FL', which show how the
associativity of multiplicative conjunction and the distributivity of
multiplicative conjunction over additive disjunction are involved in the
eliminations of the cut rule in those proof-figures. We specify how
associativity and distributivity are related to the non-eliminability of an
application of the cut rule in those proof-figures of FL'.

arrest using aqueous solutions of the globular protein lysozyme as a model
system for colloids with short-range attractions. We show that quenches below a
temperature Ta lead to gel formation as a result of a local arrest of the
proteindense phase during spinodal decomposition. The rheological properties of
these gels allow us to use centrifugation experiments to determine the local
densities of both phases and to precisely locate the gel boundary and the
attractive glass line close to and within the unstable region of the phase
diagram.
