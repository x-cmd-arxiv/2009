cannot explain completely the excessive energy output and the time variability

engine of GRB. A major problem in the proposed models with a black hole (BH) in
the center is that they don't explain the observed evidences of late time
activity of the central engine.
  In this paper we are starting the search for a possible model of that central
engine as a rotating compact body of still unknown nature. The formation of
jets in the new model lies entirely on the fundamental Teukolsky Master
Equation. We demonstrate that this general model can describe the formation of
collimated GRB-jets of various forms. Some preliminary results are presented.

Here, we report on the discovery of this timescale in the near-infrared
radiation of Sgr A*, the 4x10^6 solar mass black hole at the center of our
Galaxy, which is the most extreme sub-Eddington source accessible to
observations. Previous simultaneous monitoring campaigns established a
correspondence between the X-ray and near-infrared regime and thus the
variability timescales are likely identical for the two wavelengths. We
combined Keck and VLT data sets to achieve the necessary dense temporal
coverage, and a time baseline of four years allows for a broad temporal
frequency range. Comparison with Monte Carlo simulations is used to account for
the irregular sampling. We find a timescale at 154 (+124 -87) min (errors mark
the 90% confidence limits) which is inconsistent with a recently proposed
scaling relation that uses bolometric luminosity and black hole mass as
parameters. However, our result fits the expected value if only linear scaling
with black hole mass is assumed. We suggest that the luminosity-mass-timescale
relation applies only to black hole systems in the soft state. In the hard
state, which is characterized by lower luminosities and accretion rates, there
is just linear mass scaling, linking Sgr A* to hard state stellar mass black
holes.

effect of the assembly of a central galaxy on the shape and mass profile of its
dark halo. Two series of simulations are compared; one that follows only the
evolution of the dark matter component and a second one where a baryonic
component is added. These simulations include radiative cooling but neglect
star formation and feedback, leading most baryons to collect at the halo center
in a disk which is too small and too massive when compared with typical spiral.
This unrealistic model allows us, nevertheless, to gauge the maximum effect
that galaxies may have in transforming their dark halos. We find that the shape
of the halo becomes more axisymmetric: halos are transformed from triaxial into
essentially oblate systems, with well-aligned isopotential contours of roughly
constant flattening (c/a ~ 0.85). Halos always contract as a result of galaxy
assembly, but the effect is substantially less pronounced than predicted by the
""adiabatic contraction"" hypothesis. The reduced contraction helps to reconcile
LambdaCDM halos with constraints on the dark matter content inside the solar
circle and should alleviate the long-standing difficulty of matching
simultaneously the scaling properties of galaxy disks and the luminosity
function. The halo contraction is also less pronounced than found in earlier
simulations, a disagreement that suggests that halo contraction is not solely a
function of the initial and final distribution of baryons. Not only how much
baryonic mass has been deposited at the center of a halo matters, but also the
mode of its deposition. It might prove impossible to predict the halo response
without a detailed understanding of a galaxy's assembly history. (Abriged)

for changes in the non-equilibrium ionization behind a supernova remnant
forward shock undergoing efficient diffusive shock acceleration (DSA). The
efficient acceleration of particles (i.e., cosmic rays) lowers the shock
temperature and raises the density of the shocked gas, thus altering the
ionization state of the plasma in comparison to the test particle approximation
where cosmic rays gain an insignificant fraction of the shock energy. The
differences between the test particle and efficient acceleration cases are
substantial and occur for both slow and fast temperature equilibration rates:
in cases of higher acceleration efficiency, particular ion states are more
populated at lower electron temperatures. We also present results which show
that, in the efficient shock acceleration case, higher ionization fractions are
reached noticeably closer to the shock front than in the test-particle case,
clearly indicating that DSA may enhance thermal X-ray production. We attribute
this to the higher postshock densities which lead to faster electron
temperature equilibration and higher ionization rates. These spatial
differences should be resolvable with current and future X-ray missions, and
can be used as diagnostics in estimating the acceleration efficiency in
cosmic-ray modified shocks.

does not assume any particular comoving length scale at which a feature should
be found, but intends to perform a comparison for a wide range of scales
instead. This is done by quantifying the amount of overlap among the quasar
correlation functions at different times using a cross-correlation technique.
The most likely cosmological model is $\Omega_{\rm M}=0.21\pm 0.02$ and $w_{\rm
Q}=-0.93\pm0.04$, in agreement with previous studies. These constraints are the
result of a good overall agreement of the correlation function at different
redshifts over scales $\sim 100-300\mpc$. Under the assumption of a flat
cosmological model, our results indicate that we are living in a low density
universe with a quintessential parameter greater than the one corresponding to
a cosmological constant.

companion NGC 3729 in the 21cm line of neutral hydrogen. NGC 3718 is a
strikingly unusual galaxy with a strong straight dust lane across the center,
peculiar diffuse spiral arms, and an extended disk of neutral hydrogen. Earlier
work showed the gas disk to be strongly twisted, warping through edge-on where
we see the straight dust lane; stars formed in this gas appear to make up the
'spiral arms'. Our improved maps show a twisted but bisymmetric disk of gas
extending to 7arcmin or 35kpc, where the orbital period is roughly 1Gyr. It is
surrounded by fragmentary spiral features, and a streamer of gas extending to a
cloud lying 12arcmin or 60kpc to the north. We use INSPECTOR, a task in GIPSY,
to fit a tilted-ring model interactively to slices through the HI data cube.
The apparent major axis swings through 100 degrees from the innermost gas
orbits at 30arcsec radius to the outer edge. When viewed in the reference frame
of the galaxy's stellar disk, the innermost gas orbits are nearly polar, while
the outer rings of gas are tilted at 30-40 degrees. The line of nodes, where
the gas orbits pass through the plane of the stellar disk, twists by roughly 90
degrees about the pole. We do not see gas orbiting in the plane of the stellar
disk. If we assume that the galaxy's dark halo shares the same midplane, then
the observed twist can be explained by differential precession in a dynamical
model in which the dark halo is fairly round. The run of tilt with radius is
close to what is required for the warped gas disk to precess rigidly in the
galaxy's gravitational field without changing its shape. This fact probably
accounts for the longevity of the twisted structure.

shifts the positions of intrinsic magnetic Feshbach resonances, generates
copies of resonances previously restricted to a particular partial-wave
collision to other partial wave channels, and splits Feshbach resonances into
multiple resonances for states of non-zero angular momenta. It was recently
observed that the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction can also lift the
degeneracy of a p-wave state splitting the associated p-wave Feshbach resonance
into two distinct resonances at different magnetic fields. Our work shows that
the splitting of the resonances produced by an applied electric field is more
than an order of magnitude larger. This new phenomenon offers a complementary
way to produce and tune an anisotropic interaction and to study its effect on

undetected sources show extreme mid-IR colors, consistent with being luminous

According to the cosmic no-hair conjecture, generic expanding solutions of
Einstein's field equations in vacuum with a positive cosmological constant
isotropize and approach the de-Sitter solution asymptotically. The family of
solutions which we introduce as ""generalized Nariai solutions"", however, shows
quite unusual asymptotics and hence should be non-generic in some sense. In
this paper, we list basic facts for the Nariai solutions and characterize their
asymptotic behavior geometrically. One particular result is a rigorous proof of
the fact that the Nariai solutions do not possess smooth conformal boundaries.
We proceed by explaining the non-genericity within the class of spatially
homogeneous solutions. It turns out that perturbations of the three isometry
classes of generalized Nariai solutions are related to different mass regimes
of Schwarzschild de-Sitter solutions. A motivation for our work here is to
prepare the second paper devoted to the study of the instability of the Nariai
solutions for Gowdy symmetry. We will be particularly interested in the

checked that this is true within the class of spatially homogeneous solutions.
In this paper now, we continue these investigations within the spatially

fundamental question of cosmic no-hair and its dynamical realization in more
general classes than the spatially homogeneous case. On the other hand, the
results of the first paper suggest that the instability of the Nariai solutions
can be exploited to construct and analyze physically interesting cosmological
black hole solutions in the Gowdy class, consistent with certain claims by
Bousso in the spherically symmetric case. However, in contrast to that, we find
that it is not possible to construct cosmological black hole solutions by means
of small Gowdy symmetric perturbations of the Nariai solutions and that the

by which we mean either moving data between levels of a memory hierarchy (in

interest to design algorithms minimizing communication. In this paper we first
extend known lower bounds on the communication cost (both for bandwidth and for
latency) of conventional (O(n^3)) matrix multiplication to Cholesky
factorization, which is used for solving dense symmetric positive definite
linear systems. Second, we compare the costs of various Cholesky decomposition
implementations to these lower bounds and identify the algorithms and data
structures that attain them. In the sequential case, we consider both the
two-level and hierarchical memory models. Combined with prior results in [13,

implementations of the three basic factorizations of dense linear algebra: LU
with pivoting, QR and Cholesky. But it goes beyond this prior work on

operator of the affine structure and the nonlinear Riemann geometry of the

affine harmonic maps in a given homotopy class when the target has non positive
sectional curvature and some global non triviality condition is met. An example
shows that such a condition is necessary.
  The analytical part is made difficult by the absence of a variational
structure underlying affine harmonic maps. We therefore need to combine
estimation techniques from geometric analysis and PDE theory with global
geometric considerations.

universe using the quasi-classical WKB/tunneling method which pictures this
process as a ""tunneling"" of particles from behind the apparent horizon. The
correct temperature of the Hawking-like radiation from the FRW spacetime is
obtained using a canonical invariant tunneling amplitude. In contrast to the
usual quantum mechanical WKB/tunneling problem where the tunneling amplitude
has only a spatial contribution, we find that the tunneling amplitude for FRW
spacetime (i.e. the imaginary part of the action) has both spatial and temporal
contributions. In addition we study back reaction and energy conservation of
the radiated particles and find that the tunneling probability and change in
entropy, ${\cal S}$ are related by the relationship: $\Gamma\propto\exp[-\Delta
{\cal S}]$ which differs from the standard result $\Gamma\propto\exp[\Delta
{\cal S}]$. By regarding the whole FRW universe as an isolated adiabatic system
the change in the total entropy is zero. Then splitting the entropy between
interior and exterior parts of the horizon ($\Delta {\cal S}_{total}=\Delta
{\cal S}_{int} + \Delta {\cal S}_{ext}=0$), we can explain the origin of the
minus sign difference with the usual result: our $\Delta {\cal S}$ is for the
interior region while the standard result from black hole physics is for the
exterior region.

chosen model system (e.g., the Kohn-Sham system) is the same as the exact one,
one might expect that approximations to the exact density introduce
supplementary errors by falsifying the density. In fact, this is not true: by
modelling the exchange-correlation holes for all densities, density functional
approximations avoid this problem. The technique used to show it is a
potential-driven adiabatic connection which hopefully will also permit
constructing new approximations in the spirit of DFT.

Helmholtz equation (NLH) that governs the propagation of laser light in Kerr
dielectrics. The methodology addresses two well-known challenges in nonlinear
optics: Singular behavior of solutions when the scattering in the medium is
assumed predominantly forward (paraxial regime), and the presence of
discontinuities in the % linear and nonlinear optical properties of the medium.
Specifically, we consider a slab of nonlinear material which may be grated in
the direction of propagation and which is immersed in a linear medium as a
whole. The key components of the methodology are a semi-compact high-order
finite-difference scheme that maintains accuracy across the discontinuities and
enables sub-wavelength resolution on large domains at a tolerable cost, a
nonlocal two-way artificial boundary condition (ABC) that simultaneously
facilitates the reflectionless propagation of the outgoing waves and forward
propagation of the given incoming waves, and a nonlinear solver based on
Newton's method.
  The proposed methodology combines and substantially extends the capabilities
of our previous techniques built for 1Dand for multi-D. It facilitates a direct
numerical study of nonparaxial propagation and goes well beyond the approaches
in the literature based on the ""augmented"" paraxial models. In particular, it
provides the first ever evidence that the singularity of the solution indeed
disappears in the scalar NLH model that includes the nonparaxial effects. It
also enables simulation of the wavelength-width spatial solitons, as well as of
the counter-propagating solitons.

are given by nonlinear response functions which can be expressed by sums over
various quantum pathways of matter. We show that some pathways can be selected
by using nonclassical fields, through the entanglement of photon and material
pathways, which results in a different-power law dependence on the incoming
field intensity. Spectrally overlapping stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) and
two-photon-absorption (TPA) pathways in a pump probe experiment are separated
by controlling the degree of entanglement of pairs of incoming photons.
Pathway-selectivity opens up new avenues for mapping photon into material
entanglement. New material information, otherwise erased by interferences among
pathways, is revealed.

Maxwellian plasma in a uniform magnetic field is presented. A system which is
linearly stable may display transient growth if the linear operator describing
its evolution is non-normal, so that its eigenvectors are non-orthogonal. In
order to include plasma kinetic effects a Landau fluid model is employed. The
linear operator of the model is shown to be non-normal and the results suggest
that the nonnormality of a collisionless plasma is intrinsically related to its
kinetic nature, with the transient growth being more accentuated for smaller
scales and higher plasma beta. The results based on linear spectral theory have
been confirmed with nonlinear simulations.
