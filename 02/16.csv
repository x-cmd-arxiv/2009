used to measure the D(s)+- meson decay constant f_D(s). Recent measurements at
CLEO-c and the B factories suggest a branching ratio for both decays somewhat
higher than the Standard Model prediction using f_D(s) from unquenched lattice
calculations. The charged Higgs boson (H+-) in the Two Higgs Doublet Model
(Type II) would also mediate these decays, but any sizeable contribution from
H+- can only suppress the branching ratios and consequently is now slightly
disfavoured. It is shown that constraints on the parameters tan(beta) and m_H+-
from such decays can be competitive with and complementary to analogous
constraints derived from the leptonic meson decays B+- -> tau+- nu_tau and K+-
-> mu+- nu_mu, especially if lattice calculations eventually prefer f_D(s) <

observations of extremely metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]<-3.0) stars not belonging to

and upper limits for 26 elements between carbon and europium. The entire sample
of stars spans a range of -3.2<[Fe/H]<-2.3, and we confirm that each galaxy
contains a large intrinsic spread of Fe abundances. A comparison with MW halo
stars of similar metallicities reveals substantial agreement between the
abundance patterns of the ultra-faint dwarf galaxies and the MW halo for the
light, alpha and iron-peak elements (C to Zn). This agreement contrasts with
the results of earlier studies of more metal-rich stars (-2.5<[Fe/H]<-1.0) in
more luminous dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs), which found significant
abundance discrepancies with respect to the MW halo data. The abundances of
neutron-capture elements (Sr to Eu) in the ultra-faint dwarf galaxies are
extremely low, consistent with the most metal-poor halo stars, but not with the
typical halo abundance pattern at [Fe/H]>-3.0. Our results are broadly
consistent with a galaxy formation model that predicts that massive dwarf
galaxies are the source of the metal-rich component ([Fe/H]>-2.5) of the MW
halo, but we also suggest that the faintest known dwarfs may be the primary
contributors to the metal-poor end of the MW halo metallicity distribution.

Kaluza-Klein (KK) mass scale from charged lepton flavor violation in the
framework of the Standard Model (SM) fields propagating in a warped extra
dimension, especially in models accounting for neutrino data. These mechanisms
utilize the extended five-dimensional (5D) electroweak gauge symmetry [SU(2)_L
x SU(2)_R x U(1)_X] which is already strongly motivated in order to satisfy
electroweak precision tests in this framework. New choices of representations
for leptons under this symmetry (naturally) can allow small mixing angles for
left-handed (LH) charged leptons and simultaneously large mixing angles for
their SU(2)_L partners, i.e., the LH neutrinos, with the neutrino data being
accounted for by the latter mixings. Enhancement of charged lepton flavor
violation by the large mixing angle observed in leptonic charged currents,
which is present for the minimal choice of representations where the LH charged
lepton and neutrino mixing angles are similar, can thus be avoided in these
models. This idea might also be useful for suppressing the contributions to
B_{d, s} mixing in this framework and in order to suppress flavor violation
from superpartners (instead of from KK modes) in 5D ""flavorful supersymmetry""
models. Additionally, the less minimal representations can provide custodial
protection for shifts in couplings of fermions to Z and, in turn, further
suppress charged lepton flavor-violation from tree-level Z exchange in the
warped extra-dimensional scenario. As a result, ~O(3) TeV KK mass scale can be
simultaneously consistent with charged lepton flavor violation and neutrino
data, even without any particular structure in the 5D flavor parameters in the
framework of a warped extra dimension.

The required development of an extended, practical version of the language
based on the existing theoretical version, and the corresponding operational
semantics. Here we present detailed description of the most essential steps of
the implementation. Another crucial problem for this approach was to
demonstrate how to deal in reality with the concept of the equality relation
between (hyper)sets, which is computationally realised by the bisimulation

distributed semi-structured data, required some additional theoretical
considerations and practical suggestions for efficient implementation. To this
end the 'local/global' strategy for computing the bisimulation relation over
distributed semi-structured data was developed and its efficiency was
experimentally confirmed.

determinations are based. Models generally perform very well in predicting
coeval ages for eclipsing binaries with main-sequence components more massive
than ~1.2 Msun; relative ages are good to ~5% or better in this mass regime.
Low-mass main-sequence stars (M < 0.8 Msun) reveal large discrepancies in the
model predicted ages, primarily due to magnetic activity in the observed stars
that appears to inhibit convection and likely causes the radii to be 10-20%
larger than predicted. In mass-radius diagrams these stars thus appear 50-90%
older or younger than they really are. Aside from these activity-related
effects, low-mass pre--main-sequence stars at ages ~1 Myr can also show
non-coevality of ~30% due to star formation effects, however these effects are
largely erased after ~10 Myr.

group catalogs, one based on the 2MASS redshift survey and the other on the
SDSS Data Release 5 galaxy catalog. We find that the sigma_v of groups is
strongly correlated with the group projected b/a and size, with elongated and
larger groups having a lower sigma_v. Such a correlation could be attributed to
the dynamical evolution of groups, with groups in the initial stages of
formation, having small sigma_v, a large size and an elongated shape that
reflects the anisotropic accretion of galaxies along filamentary structures.
The same sort of correlations, however, could also be reproduced in
prolate-like groups, if the net galaxy motion is preferentially along the group
elongation, since then the groups oriented close to the line of sight will
appear more spherical, will have a small projected size and large sigma_v,
while groups oriented close to the sky-plane will appear larger in projection,
more elongated, and will have smaller sigma_v. We perform tests that relate
only to the dynamical evolution of groups (eg., calculating the fraction of
early type galaxies in groups) and indeed we find a strong positive (negative)
correlation between the group sigma_v (projected major axis) with the fraction
of early type galaxies. We conclude that (a) the observed dependencies of the
group sigma_v on the group projected size and b/a, should be attributed mostly
to the dynamical state of groups and (b) groups in the local universe do not
constitute a family of objects in dynamical equilibrium, but rather a family of
cosmic structures that are presently at various stages of their virialization

metallic systems based on the Keldysh formalism, taking into account the

to a Rashba 2DEG ferromagnet and calculate the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and
anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR). The numerical calculations reproduce
analytical results in the metallic regime revealing the crossover between the
skew scattering mechanism dominating in the clean systems and intrinsic
mechanism dominating in the moderately dirty systems. As we increase the
disorder further, the AHE starts to diminish due to the spectral broadening of
the quasiparticles. Although for certain parameters this reduction of the AHE
can be approximated as $\sigma_{xy}\thicksim\sigma_{xx}^{\varphi}$ with
$\varphi$ varying around 1.6, this is found not to be true in general as
$\sigma_{xy}$ can go through a change in sign as a function of disorder
strength in some cases. The reduction region in which the quasiparticle
approximation is meaningful is relatively narrow; therefore, a theory with a
wider range of applicability is called for. By considering the higher order
skew scattering processes, we resolve some discrepancies between the AHE
results obtained by using the Keldysh, Kubo and Boltzmann approaches. We also
show that similar higher order processes are important for the AMR when the
nonvertex and vertex parts cancel each other. We calculate the AMR in
anisotropic systems properly taking into account the anisotropy of the
non-equilibrium distribution function. These calculations confirm recent
findings on the unreliability of common approximations to the Boltzmann

formation process. Therefore, the physical conditions in these disks -
structure and composition as a function of stellocentric radius and vertical
height, density and temperature profiles of each component - represent the
initial conditions under which planets form. Clearly, a good understanding of
disk structure and its time evolution are crucial to understanding planet
formation, the evolution of young planetary systems (e.g. migration), and the
recently discovered, and unanticipated, diversity of planetary architectures.

observational challenges in spatially resolving this region. In this

the gas phase and on grain mantles in the form of ice, from prestellar core

a physical model from which we take the density, temperature, and the flow of
the gas. Trace particles, moving along with the gas, are used to follow the
chemistry during prestellar core collapse and disk formation. The evolution of
the abundances and the composition of ices on grain mantles were compared to
observations. We also investigated the initial abundances to be adopted in more
detailed modeling of protoplanetary disks by following the chemical evolution
of trace particles accreting onto the disk. Fractional abundances of HCO+,
N2H+, H2CO, HC3N, and CH3OH from our model with grain surface reactions provide
a good match to observations, while abundances of CO, CS, SO, HCN, and HNC show
better agreement without grain surface reactions. The observed mantle
composition of dust grains is best reproduced when we include surface
reactions. The initial chemical abundances to be used for detailed modeling of
a protoplanetary disk are found to be different from those in dark interstellar

mass, a measure of chiral symmetry breaking, grows rapidly. This measure is
largely due to near zero fermion eigenmodes of logarithm of the 4D transfer
matrix along the fifth dimension, and these eigenmodes increase rapidly at
strong coupling. To suppress these eigenmodes, we have added to the DWF path
integral a multiplicative weighting factor consisting of a ratio of
determinants of Wilson-Dirac fermions having a chirally twisted mass with a
large negative real component and a small imaginary chiral component. Numerical
results show that this weighting factor with an appropriate choice of twisted
masses significantly suppresses the residual mass while allowing adequate
topological tunneling.

quite different than they were when the surveys were being planned. The current
surveys succeeded in this evolving terrain by being very general tools that
could be applied to a number of very fundamental measurements. Likewise, the
accessibility of the data enabled the broader cosmological and astronomical
community to generate more science than the survey collaborations could alone.

galactic structures merge to form the galaxies that we see today. The past
decade has provided remarkable observational support for this scenario, driven
in part by advances in spectroscopic instrumentation. Multi-object spectroscopy
enabled the discovery of kinematically cold substructures around the Milky Way
and M31 that are likely the debris of disrupting satellites. Improvements in
high-resolution spectroscopy have produced key evidence that the abundance
patterns of the Milky Way halo and its dwarf satellites can be explained by
Galactic chemical evolution models based on hierarchical assembly.
  These breakthroughs have depended almost entirely on observations of nearby
stars in the Milky Way and luminous red giant stars in M31 and Local Group
dwarf satellites. In the next decade, extremely large telescopes will allow
observations far down the luminosity function in the known dwarf galaxies, and
they will enable observations of individual stars far out in the Galactic halo.
The chemical abundance census now available for the Milky Way will become
possible for our nearest neighbor, M31. Velocity dispersion measurements now
available in M31 will become possible for systems beyond the Local Group such
as Sculptor and M81 Group galaxies. Detailed studies of a greater number of
individual stars in a greater number of spiral galaxies and their satellites
will test hierarchical assembly in new ways because dynamical and chemical
evolution models predict different outcomes for halos of different masses in
different environments.

III (Pop III) stars of 25, 40, 80, and 120 M_sun on the subsequent Pop III star
formation. In this paper, particular attention is paid to the dependence of
radiative feedback on the mass of source Pop III star. UV radiation from the
source star can work to impede the secondary star formation through the
photoheating and photodissociation processes. Recently, Susa & Umemura (2006)
have shown that the ionizing radiation alleviates the negative effect by
H_2-dissociating radiation from 120$M_sun PopIII star, since an H_2 shell
formed ahead of an ionizing front can effectively shield H_2-dissociating
radiation. On the other hand, it is expected that the negative feedback by
H_2-dissociating radiation can be predominant if a source star is less massive,
since a ratio of the H_2-dissociating photon number to the ionizing photon
number becomes higher. In order to investigate the radiative feedback effects
from such less massive stars, we perform three-dimensional radiation
hydrodynamic simulations, incorporating the radiative transfer effect of
ionizing and H_2-dissociating radiation. As a result, we find that if a source
star is less massive than ~25M_sun, the ionizing radiation cannot suppress the
negative feedback of H_2-dissociating radiation. Therefore, the fate of the
neighboring clouds around such less massive stars is determined solely by the
flux of H_2-dissociating radiation from source stars. With making analytic
estimates of H_2 shell formation and its shielding effect, we derive the
criteria for radiation hydrodynamic feedback depending on the source star mass.

disk. The luminosity, disk size, and temperature suggest that NGC 5204 X-1
harbors a compact object more massive than stellar-mass black holes. In
contrast, the disk model in IC 342 X-1 is ruled out because the luminosity
decreases as the temperature increases; sources with such behaviors may
represent a class of objects with super-Eddington accretion. Also, we report a
peculiar soft spectral feature from IC 342 X-2 and variability on a time scale
of 20 ks from Holmberg II X-1. More observations are needed to test these
results.

energy G_e. The functional G_e models strong phase separation in AB diblock
copolymer melts, and patterns are represented by {0,1}-valued functions; the
values 0 and 1 correspond to the A and B phases. The parameter e is the ratio
between the intrinsic, material length scale and the scale of the domain. We
show that in the limit (as e goes to 0) any sequence u_e of patterns with
uniformly bounded energy G_e(u_e) becomes stripe-like: the pattern becomes
locally one-dimensional and resembles a periodic stripe pattern of periodicity
O(e). In the limit the stripes become uniform in width and increasingly
straight.
  Our results are formulated as a convergence theorem, which states that the
functional G_e Gamma-converges to a limit functional G_0. This limit functional
is defined on fields of rank-one projections, which represent the local
direction of the stripe pattern. The functional G_0 is only finite if the
projection field solves a version of the Eikonal equation, and in that case it
is the L^2-norm of the divergence of the projection field, or equivalently the
L^2-norm of the curvature of the field.
  At the level of patterns the converging objects are the jump measures
|grad(u_e)| combined with the projection fields corresponding to the tangents
to the jump set. The central inequality from Peletier & Roeger, (Archive for
Rational Mechanics and Analysis, to appear), provides the initial estimate and
leads to weak measure-function-pair convergence. We obtain strong convergence

displacement satisfies the same Euler-Lagrange equation in ideal and relaxed

singular surfaces is analysed in cylindrical geometry: in ideal MHD only
Newcomb's [W. A. Newcomb (2006) Ann. Phys., 10, 232] small solutions are
allowed, whereas in relaxed MHD only the odd-parity large solution and
even-parity small solution are allowed. A procedure for constructing global
multi-region solutions in cylindrical geometry is presented. Focussing on the
limit where the two interfaces approach each other arbitrarily closely, it is
shown that the singular-limit problem encountered previously [M.J. Hole et al.

the relaxed-MHD region between the coalescing interfaces is replaced by an
ideal-MHD region. We then present a stable (k, pressure) phase space plot,
which allows us to determine the form a stable pressure and field profile must
take in the region between the interfaces. From this knowledge, we conclude
that there exists a class of single interface plasmas that were found stable by

charged particles that argues that the consistency of elementary quantum
mechanics requires that the electromagnetic field must be quantized. In the
experiment a particle's path through the slits is determined by measuring the
Coulomb field that it produces at large distances; under these conditions the
interference pattern must be suppressed. The key is that as the particle's
trajectory is bent in diffraction by the slits it must radiate and the
radiation must carry away phase information. Thus the radiation field must be a
quantized dynamical degree of freedom. On the other hand, if one similarly
tries to determine the path of a massive particle through an inferometer by
measuring the Newtonian gravitational potential the particle produces, the
interference pattern would have to be finer than the Planck length and thus
undiscernable. Unlike for the electromagnetic field, Bohr's argument does not
imply that the gravitational field must be quantized.

with decrease of the distance between two reaction partners after the touching
configuration. The mass parameter for the neck motion first decreases slightly
up to the touching configuration and then increases with the neck width, and
its magnitude is from less than tenth to several times more than the total mass
of the system. The mass parameters obtained from the microscopic transport
model are larger than the ones obtained from the hydrodynamic model and smaller
than those obtained from the linear response function theory. The mass
parameters for both motions depend on the reaction systems, but the one for the
relative motion depends on the incompressibility of the EoS more obviously than
that for neck motion.

successfully reproduces the instability of high-flux traffic. It is often
pointed out that there is a close relation between the optimal velocity model
and the mKdV equation, a soliton equation. Meanwhile, the ultra-discrete method
enables one to reduce soliton equations to cellular automata which inherit the
solitonic nature, such as an infinite number of conservation laws, and soliton
solutions. We find that the theory of soliton equations is available for
generic differential equations, and the simulation results reveal that the

on the calculation of the Bruggeman average dielectric function of a mixture of
the known parallel and perpendicular dielectric functions of graphite. The pi
absorption feature of Rayleigh-sized spheres of this mixture falls near 4.6
mu-1 (2175 Angstroms), but its width is 1.5 mu-1, somewhat larger than the
astronomically observed average, 1 mu-1. This is confirmed by measurements of
the reflectance of an industrial material, polycrystalline graphite. A better
fit to the IS feature position and width is obtained with a hypothetical
material, having the same dielectric functions as natural graphite, except for
less extended wings of the pi resonance. Physically, this could result from
changes in the electronic band structure due to previous thermal histories. On
this model, the Frolich feature central wavelength depends only on the pi
resonance frequency, while its width depends only on the damping constant of
the same resonance. This explains the range of observed feature widths at

a simple model of stellar pulsation with two different sets of parameters

as the phase dispersion method and periodograms. For comparison, a
quasi-periodic signal is employed as well.

predecessor data structures. Our focus is on space-efficient FIDs on the
\textsc{ram} model with word size $\Theta(\lg m)$ and constant time for all
operations, so that the time cost is independent of the input size. Given the
bitstring $S$ to be encoded, having length $m$ and containing $n$ ones, the

uses \[ B(n,m) + O(n^{1+\delta} + n (\frac{m}{n^s})^\eps) \] bits and performs
all the operations in time $O(s\delta^{-1} + \eps^{-1})$. The improvement is
twofold: our redundancy can be lowered parametrically and, fixing $s = O(1)$,
we get a constant-time FID whose space is $B(n,m) + O(m^\eps/\poly{n})$ bits,
for sufficiently large $m$. This is a significant improvement compared to the

varying the parameters of the system (masses, sizes, density and coefficients

correlations beyond relaxation and polarization can be readily incorporated.
The electron correlation treatment is performed on finite clusters. In
conducting our study, we make use of localized Wannier functions and embedding
potentials derived explicitly from prior periodic Hartree-Fock calculations.
The on-site and nearest-neighbor charge relaxation bring corrections of several
eV to the Hartree-Fock band gap. Additional corrections are caused by
long-range polarization effects. In contrast, the dispersion of the
Hartree-Fock bands is marginally affected by electron correlations. Our final

L723 star-forming region. It lies projected onto the largest blueshifted lobe
of the cuadrupolar CO outflow powered by a low-mass YSO system embedded in the
core of L723. We analysed the physical conditions and kinematics along HH 223
with the aim of disentangling whether the emission arises from shock-excited,
supersonic gas characteristic of a stellar jet, or is only tracing the wall
cavity excavated by the CO outflow. We performed long-slit optical spectroscopy
along HH 223, crossing all the bright knots (A to E) and part of the
low-brightness emission nebula (F filament). One spectrum of each knot,
suitable to characterize the nature of its emission, was obtained. The physical
conditions and the radial velocity of the HH 223 emission along the slits were
also sampled at smaller scale (0.6"") than the knot sizes. {The spectra of all
the HH 223 knots appear as those of the intermediate/high excitation
Herbig-Haro objects. The emission is supersonic, with blueshifted peak
velocities ranging from -60 to -130 km/s. Reliable variations in the kinematics
and physical conditions at smaller scale that the knot sizes are also found.
The properties of the HH 223 emission derived from the spectroscopy confirm the
HH nature of the object, the supersonic optical outflow most probably also
being powered by the YSOs embedded in the L723 core.

  through a Quantum Dot",,,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Linear response conductance of a two terminal Aharonov-Bohm (AB)
interferometer is an even function of magnetic field. This ""phase symmetry"" is
no expected to hold beyond the linear response regime. In simple AB rings the
phase of the oscillations changes smoothly (almost linearly) with voltage bias.
However, in an interferometer with a quantum dot in its arm, tuned to the
Coulomb blockade regime, experiments indicate that phase symmetry seems to
persist even in the nonlinear regime.
  In this letter we discuss the processes that break AB phase symmetry. In
particular we show that breaking of phase symmetry in such an interferometer is
possible only after the onset of inelastic cotunneling, i.e. when the voltage
bias is larger than the excitation energy in the dot. The asymmetric component
of AB oscillations is significant only when the contributions of different
levels to the symmetric component nearly cancel out (e.g., due to different
parity of these levels), which explains the sharp changes of the AB phase. We
show that our theoretical results are consistent with experimental findings.

specific target site on DNA. However, recent single molecule experiment
reported that proteins can diffuse on DNA. This suggests that the interactions
between proteins and DNA play a role during the target search even far from the
specific site. It is unclear how these non-specific interactions optimize the
search process, and how the protein structure comes into play. Each nucleotide
being negatively charged, one may think that the positive surface of DNA-BPs
should electrostatically collapse onto DNA. Here we show by means of Monte
Carlo simulations and analytical calculations that a counter-intuitive
repulsion between the two oppositely charged macromolecules exists at a
nanometer range. We also show that this repulsion is due to a local increase of
the osmotic pressure exerted by the ions which are trapped at the interface.
For the concave shape of DNA-BPs, and for realistic protein charge densities,
we find that the repulsion pushes the protein in a free energy minimum at a
distance from DNA. As a consequence, a favourable path exists along which
proteins can slide without interacting with the DNA bases. When a protein
encounters its target, the osmotic barrier is completely counter-balanced by
the H-bond interaction, thus enabling the sequence recognition.

proper motions is assembled, using the repeated multi-band Sloan Digital Sky
Survey photometric measurements in Stripe 82. Our sample of halo subdwarfs is
extracted via a reduced proper motion diagram and distances are obtained using
photometric parallaxes, thus giving full phase space information. The tilt of
the velocity ellipsoid with respect to the spherical polar coordinate system is
computed and found to be consistent with zero for two of the three tilt angles,
and very small for the third. We prove that if the inner halo is in a
steady-state and the triaxial velocity ellipsoid is everywhere aligned in
spherical polar coordinates, then the potential must be spherically symmetric.
The detectable, but very mild, misalignment with spherical polars is consistent
with the perturbative effects of the Galactic disk on a spherical dark halo.
Banana orbits are generated at the 1:1 resonance (in horizontal and vertical
frequency) by the disk. They populate Galactic potentials at the typical radii
of our subdwarf sample, along with the much more dominant short-axis tubes.
However, on geometric grounds alone, the tilt cannot vanish for the banana
orbits and this leads to a slight, but detectable, misalignment. We argue that
the tilt of the stellar halo velocity ellipsoid therefore provides a hitherto
largely neglected but important line of argument that the Milky Way's dark
halo, which dominates the potential, must be nearly spherical.

variational assimilation in the unstable subspace (4DVar-AUS), that consists in
confining in this subspace the increment of the control variable. The existence
of an optimal subspace dimension for this confinement is hypothesized.
Theoretical arguments in favor of the present approach are supported by
numerical experiments in a simple perfect non-linear model scenario. It is
found that the RMS analysis error is a function of the dimension N of the
subspace where the analysis is confined and is minimum for N approximately
equal to the dimension of the unstable and neutral manifold. For all
assimilation windows, from 1 to 5 days, 4DVar-AUS performs better than standard
4DVar. In the presence of observational noise, the 4DVar solution, while being
closer to the observations, if farther away from the truth. The implementation
of 4DVar-AUS does not require the adjoint integration.

producing a smooth supersonic integrated line profile for the giant HII region.
The brightest central region (R ~ 50 pc) is responsible for sigma derived from
a single fit to the integrated line profile. The dominant action of gravity,
and possibly unresolved winds of young (<10 Myr) massive stars, in this small
