flow where a net cross helicity of either sign can emerge. This flow, which is
also known as the Archontis flow, is a generalization of the
Arnold--Beltrami--Childress flow, but with the cosine terms omitted. The
presence of cross helicity leads to a mean-field dynamo effect that is known as
the Yoshizawa effect. Direct numerical simulations of such flows demonstrate
the presence of magnetic fields on scales larger than the scale of the flow.
Contrary to earlier expectations, the Yoshizawa effect is found to be
proportional to the mean magnetic field and can therefore lead to its
exponential instead of just linear amplification for magnetic Reynolds numbers
that exceed a certain critical value. Unlike $\alpha$ effect dynamos, it is
found that the Yoshizawa effect is not noticeably constrained by the presence
of a conservation law. It is argued that this is due to the presence of a
forcing term in the momentum equation which leads to a nonzero correlation with
the magnetic field. Finally, the application to energy convergence in solar
wind turbulence is discussed.

of fireballs is explored. It is found that, due to the curvature effect, the
integrated flux and peak energy are well related by a power law in the decaying
phase of pulses, where the index is about 3, being free of the intrinsic
emission and the Lorentz factor. The spectrum of a pulse in its decaying phase
differs slightly for different intrinsic spectral evolution patterns,
indicating that it is dominated by the curvature effect. In the rising phase,
the integrated flux keeps increasing whilst the peak energy remains unchanged
when the intrinsic emission bears an unchanged spectrum. Within this phase, the
flux decreases with the increasing of the peak energy for a hard-to-soft
intrinsic spectrum, and for a soft-to-hard-to-soft intrinsic spectrum, the flux
generally increases with the increasing of the peak energy. An intrinsic

interpretation of such a Schr\""odinger equation yields Euler and Navier-Stokes
equations. We therefore choose to extend this formalism to study the properties
of a system exhibiting a chaotic behavior both in space and time which amounts
to consider them as issued from the geodesic features of a mathematical object
exhibiting all the properties of a fractal `space-time'. Starting with the
simplest Klein-Gordon-like form that can be given to the geodesic equation in
this case, we obtain a motion equation for a `three fluid' velocity field and
three continuity equations, together with parametric expressions for the three
velocity components which allow us to derive relations between their
non-vanishing curls. At the non relativistic limit and owing to the physical
properties exhibited by this solution, we suggest that it could represent some
kind of three-dimensional chaotic behavior in a classical fluid, tentatively
turbulent if particular conditions are fulfilled. The appearance of a

Photodissociation Region (PDR), as a template to investigate the ionization
fraction gradient in molecular clouds. We analyze a PdBI map of the H13CO+

new HOC+ and CO+ observations. We compare self-consistently the observed
spatial distribution and line intensities with detailed depth-dependent
predictions of a PDR model coupled with a nonlocal radiative transfer
calculation. The chemical network includes deuterated species, 13C
fractionation reactions and HCO+/HOC+ isomerization reactions. The role of
neutral and charged PAHs in the cloud chemistry and ionization balance is
investigated. The detection of HOC+ reactive ion towards the Horsehead PDR
proves the high ionization fraction of the outer UV irradiated regions, where
we derive a low [HCO+]/[HOC+]~75-200 abundance ratio. In the absence of PAHs,
we reproduce the observations with gas-phase metal abundances, [Fe+Mg+...],
lower than 4x10(-9) (with respect to H) and a cosmic-rays ionization rate of
zeta=(5+/-3)x10(-17) s(-1). The inclusion of PAHs modifies the ionization
fraction gradient and increases the required metal abundance. The ionization
fraction in the Horsehead edge follows a steep gradient, with a scale length of
~0.05 pc (or ~25''), from [e-]~10(-4) (or n_e ~ 1-5 cm(-3)) in the PDR to a few
times ~10(-9) in the core. PAH^- anions play a role in the charge balance of
the cold and neutral gas if substantial amounts of free PAHs are present ([PAH]

the active hair-bundle motility that amplifies and tunes responsiveness. The

for the formation of a massive elliptical galaxy in order to understand its
impact on the formation of the spheroids. We replace the empirical infall law
of the model by Pipino & Matteucci with a cosmologically derived infall law for
the formation of an elliptical galaxy. We constrast our predictions with
observations. We also compare the obtained results with those of Pipino &
Matteucci. We computed models with and without galactic winds: we found that
models without wind predict a too large current SNIa rate. In particular, the
cosmological model produces a current SNIa which is about ten times higher than
the observed values. Moreover models without wind predict a large current SNII
rate, too large even if compared with the recent GALEX data. The predicted SNII
rate for the model with wind, on the other hand, is too low if compared with
the star formation histories given by GALEX. Last but not least, the mean value
for the [Mg/Fe] ratio in the dominant stellar population of the simulated
galaxy, as predicted by the cosmological model, is too low if compared to
observations. This is, a very important result indicating that the cosmological
infall law is in contrast with the chemical evolution. A cosmologically derived
infall law for an elliptical galaxy cannot reproduce all the chemical
constraints given by the observations. The problem resides in the fact that the
cosmologically derived infall law implies a slow gas accretion with consequent
star formation rate active for a long period. In this situation low [Mg/Fe]
ratios are produced for the dominant stellar population in a typical
elliptical, at variance with observations.

L_X^{1.11+/-0.07}, with a reduction of the scatter in luminosities as compared

12-micron bolometric corrections range over ~10-30 if a known luminosity trend

important implications for the structures of Seyfert cores. The typical
resolution-limit of our imaging corresponds to ~70 pc at a median z=0.01, and
the tightness of the correlation constrains any residual star-formation within

must take into account the age of the system. We predict that planet scattering
creates a population of detectable giant planets on wide orbits that decreases

the role of feedback, dividing the sample into cool core (CC) and non cool core
(NCC) systems, the first time the latter have been studied in detail in the
group regime. The coolest groups have steeper entropy profiles than the warmest
systems, and NCC groups have higher central entropy and exhibit more scatter
than their CC counterparts. We compare the entropy distribution of the gas in
each system to the expected theoretical distribution ignoring non-gravitational
processes. In all cases, the observed maximum entropy far exceeds that expected
theoretically, and simple models for modifications of the theoretical entropy
distribution perform poorly. Applying initial pre-heating, followed by
radiative cooling, generally fails to match the low entropy behaviour, and only
performs well when the difference between the maximum entropy of the observed
and theoretical distributions is small. Successful feedback models need to work
differentially to increase the entropy range in the gas, and we suggest two
basic possibilities. We analyse the effects of feedback on the entropy
distribution, finding systems with a high measure of `feedback impact' to reach
higher entropy than their low feedback counterparts and also to show
significantly lower central metallicities. If low entropy, metal-rich gas has
been boosted to large entropy in the high feedback systems, it must now reside
outside 0.5r_500, to remain undetected. We find similar levels of enrichment in
both high and low feedback systems, and argue that the lack of extra metals in
the highest feedback systems points to an AGN origin for the bulk of the
feedback, probably acting within precursor structures.

catastrophic redshift errors - cases where the true redshift is misestimated by
a significant amount. To compute the biases in cosmological parameters, we
adopt an efficient linearized analysis where the redshift errors are directly
related to shifts in the weak lensing convergence power spectra. We estimate
the number Nspec of unbiased spectroscopic redshifts needed to determine the
catastrophic error rate well enough that biases in cosmological parameters are
below statistical errors of weak lensing tomography. While the straightforward
estimate of Nspec is ~10^6 we find that using only the photometric redshifts
with z<=2.5 leads to a drastic reduction in Nspec to ~30,000 while negligibly
increasing statistical errors in dark energy parameters. Therefore, the size of
spectroscopic survey needed to control catastrophic errors is similar to that
previously deemed necessary to constrain the core of the z_s-z_p distribution.
We also study the efficacy of the recent proposal to measure redshift errors by
cross-correlation between the photo-z and spectroscopic samples. We find that
this method requires ~10% a priori knowledge of the bias and stochasticity of
the outlier population, and is also easily confounded by lensing magnification
bias. The cross-correlation method is therefore unlikely to supplant the need
for a complete spectroscopic redshift survey of the source population.

brightnesses, large line widths, line ratios and the clumpy nature of these
galaxies. We show that photoionization calculations and emission line
diagnostics imply gas pressures and densities that are similar to the most
intense nearby star-forming regions at z=0 but over much larger scales (10-20
kpc). A relationship between surface brightness and velocity dispersion can be
explained through simple energy injection arguments and a scaling set by nearby
galaxies with no free parameters. The high velocity dispersions are a natural
consequence of intense star formation thus regions of high velocity dispersion
are not evidence for mass concentrations such as bulges or rings. External
mechanisms like cosmological gas accretion generally do not have enough energy
to sustain the high velocity dispersions. In some cases, the high pressures and
low gas metallicites may make it difficult to robustly distinguish between AGN
ionization cones and star formation, as we show for BzK-15504 at z=2.38. We
construct a picture where the early stages of galaxy evolution are driven by
self-gravity which powers strong turbulence until the velocity dispersion is
high. Then massive, dense, gas-rich clumps collapse, triggering star formation
with high efficiencies and intensities as observed. At this stage, the intense
star formation is likely self-regulated by the mechanical energy output of
massive stars.

histories provide unique insights into the nature of the supernova progenitors,
which we compare with the properties of the supernova explosions derived from
the remnants themselves and from supernova light echoes. We find that all the
core collapse supernovae that we have studied are associated with vigorous star
formation in the recent past. Stars more massive than 21.5Msun are very scarce
around SNR N49, implying that the magnetar SGR 0526-66 in this SNR was either
formed elsewhere or came from a progenitor with a mass well below the 30Msun
threshold suggested in the literature. Three of our four Ia SNRs are associated
with old, metal poor stellar populations. This includes SNR 0509-67.5, which is
known to have been originated by an extremely bright Type Ia event, and yet is
located very far away from any sites of recent star formation, in a population
with a mean age of 7.9 Gyr. The Type Ia SNR N103B, on the other hand, is
associated with recent star formation, and might have had a relatively younger
and more massive progenitor with substantial mass loss before the explosion. We
discuss these results in the context of our present understanding of core
collapse and Type Ia supernova progenitors.

metallicity, including the Milky Way, the Magellanic Clouds, and M31. We find

with modeling the physical properties of RSGs at low metallicity. We have also
examined several unusual RSGs, including VY CMa in the Milky Way, WOH G64 in

considerable variations in their physical parameters, most notably their
effective temperatures. For all of these stars we reexamine their placement on

optical spectra of the peculiar supernova (SN) 2008ha. SN 2008ha had a very low
peak luminosity, reaching only M_V = -14.2 mag, and low line velocities of only
~2000 km/s near maximum brightness, indicating a very small kinetic energy per
unit mass of ejecta. Spectroscopically, SN 2008ha is a member of the SN
2002cx-like class of SNe, a peculiar subclass of SNe Ia; however, SN 2008ha is
the most extreme member, being significantly fainter and having lower line
velocities than the typical member, which is already ~2 mag fainter and has
line velocities ~5000 km/s smaller (near maximum brightness) than a normal SN
Ia. SN 2008ha had a remarkably short rise time of only ~10 days, significantly
shorter than either SN 2002cx-like objects (~15 days) or normal SNe Ia (~19.5
days). The bolometric light curve of SN 2008ha indicates that SN 2008ha peaked
at L_peak = (9.5 +/- 1.4) x 10^40 ergs/s, making SN 2008ha perhaps the least
luminous SN ever observed. From its peak luminosity and rise time, we infer
that SN 2008ha generated (3.0 +/- 0.9) x 10^-3 M_sun of 56Ni, had a kinetic
energy of ~2 x 10^48 ergs, and ejected 0.15 M_sun of material. We classify
three new (and one potential) members of the SN 2002cx-like class, expanding
the sample to 14 (and one potential) members. The host-galaxy morphology
distribution of the class is consistent with that of SNe Ia, Ib, Ic, and II.
Several models for generating low-luminosity SNe can explain the observations
of SN 2008ha; however, if a single model is to describe all SN 2002cx-like
objects, either electron capture in Ne-Mg white dwarfs causing a core collapse,
or deflagration of C-O white dwarfs with SN 2008ha being a partial deflagration
and not unbinding the progenitor star, are preferred. Abridged.

element-connectivity of two terminals u,v \in T is the maximum number of u-v
paths that are pairwise disjoint in both edges and non-terminals V \setminus T
(the paths need not be disjoint in terminals). Element-connectivity is more
general than edge-connectivity and less general than vertex-connectivity. Hind
and Oellermann gave a graph reduction step that preserves the global
element-connectivity of the graph. We show that this step also preserves local
connectivity, that is, all the pairwise element-connectivities of the
terminals. We give two applications of this reduction step to connectivity and
network design problems:
  1. Given a graph G and disjoint terminal sets T_1, T_2, ..., T_m, we seek a
maximum number of element-disjoint Steiner forests where each forest connects
each T_i. We prove that if each T_i is k-element-connected then there exist
\Omega(\frac{k}{\log h \log m}) element-disjoint Steiner forests, where h =
|\bigcup_i T_i|. If G is planar (or more generally, has fixed genus), we show
that there exist \Omega(k) Steiner forests. Our proofs are constructive, giving
poly-time algorithms to find these forests; these are the first non-trivial
algorithms for packing element-disjoint Steiner Forests.
  2. We give a very short and intuitive proof of a spider-decomposition theorem
of Chuzhoy and Khanna in the context of the single-sink k-vertex-connectivity
problem; this yields a simple and alternative analysis of an O(k \log n)
approximation.
  Our results highlight the effectiveness of the element-connectivity reduction
step; we believe it will find more applications in the future.

attribute the hot component to collisionally heated dust in the circumstellar

This black hole solution represents a natural generalization of the famous
four-dimensional Kerr-Newman solution to five dimensions with the inclusion of
a Chern-Simons term to the Maxwell equation. It is shown that the usual Dirac
equation can not be separated by variables in this general spacetime with two
independent angular momenta. However if one supplements an additional
counterterm into the usual Dirac operator, then the modified Dirac equation for
the spin-1/2 spinor particles is separable in this rotating, charged
Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons black hole background geometry. A first-order
symmetry operator that commutes with the modified Dirac operator has exactly
the same form as that previously found in the uncharged Myers-Perry black hole
case. It is expressed in terms of a rank-three totally antisymmetric tensor and
its covariant derivative. This tensor obeys a generalized Killing-Yano equation
and its square is a second-order symmetric Stackel-Killing tensor admitted by
the five-dimensional rotating, charged black hole spacetime.

much lower than 700 km, a typical value for radio pulsars.
  It is argued that the radio interpulse arises from emission formed on open
fieldlines close to the magnetic axis which do not pass through the
magnetosphere's null (zero-charge) surface. However the main pulse emission
must originate from fieldlines lying well outside the polar cap boundary beyond
the null surface, and farther away from the magnetic axis than those of the
outergap region where the single gamma-ray peak is generated. This casts doubt
on the common assumption that all pulsars have closed, quiescent, corotating

dimension of space, and resulting in the global one-dimensional model of a
higher dimensional quantum gravity.
  The purely quantum-mechanical part of this model is a minimal effective model
within the quantum geometrodynamics, introduced by J.A. Wheeler and B.S. DeWitt
in the 1960s, but the effective potential is manifestly different from the one
considered by Wheeler & DeWitt. Moreover, in our model the wave functionals
solving the quantum gravity are one-variable smooth functions and, therefore,
the troublesome mathematical technique of the Feynman functional integration
present in the Hawking formulation of quantum gravity, is absent is this model,
what makes it a mathematically consistent theory of quantum gravitation.
  In this paper, we discuss in some detail a certain part of the global
one-dimensional model already proposed in 2010, and then developed in 2012. The
generalized functional expansion of the effective potential and the residual
approximation, which describe the embedded spaces which are maximally symmetric
three-dimensional Einstein's manifolds, whose lead to the Newton-Coulomb type
potential in the quantum gravity model, are considered. Furthermore, scenarios
related to few selected specific forms of the effective potential are suggested
as physically interesting and discussed.

redward of the Balmer limit are dominated by starlight, and the spectra at blue
end by both an AGN continuum and a MgII broad emission line. Such unique
property allows us to examine both AGN and its host galaxy in individual galaxy
simultaneously. At first, 15 hybrid QSOs are selected from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey Data Release 6. The spectra are then analyzed in detail in three
objects: SDSS J162446.49+461946.7, SDSS J102633.32+103443.8 and SDSS
J090036.44+381353.0. Our spectral analyzing shows that the current star
formation activities are strongly suppressed, and that the latest burst ages
range from ~400Myr to 1Gyr. Basing upon the MgII-based black hole masses, the
three hybrid QSOs are consistent with the D_n(4000)-L/L_{Edd} sequence that was
previously established in local AGNs. The three hybrid QSOs are located in the
middle range of the sequence, which implies that the hybrid QSOs are at the
transition stage not only from young to old AGN, but also from host-dominated
phase to AGN-dominated phase.

the imprints of the strong Doppler shifts and gravitational red-shifts close to
black holes. The extremity of these shifts depends on the proximity of the
innermost stable circular orbit to the black hole, and that orbit is determined
by the black hole spin parameter. Modeling relativistic spectral features,
then, gives a means of estimating black hole spin. We report on the results of
fits made to archival X-ray spectra of stellar-mass black holes and black hole
candidates, selected for strong disk reflection features. Following recent
work, these spectra were fit with reflection models and disk continuum emission
models (where required) in which black hole spin is a free parameter. Although
our results must be regarded as preliminary, we find evidence for a broad range
of black hole spin parameters in our sample. The black holes with the most
relativistic radio jets are found to have high spin parameters, though jets are
observed in a black hole with a low spin parameter. For those sources with
constrained binary system parameters, we examine the distribution of spin
parameters versus black hole mass, binary mass ratio, and orbital period. We
discuss the results within the context of black hole creation events,
relativistic jet production, and efforts to probe the innermost relativistic
regime around black holes.

describe fermion masses and mixings. The Weinberg operator has been used in
order to provide the smallness of the neutrino masses, while a set of scalar
fields, getting non-vanishing vacuum expectation values, spontaneously breaks
down S4 and provides the Tri-Bimaximal pattern as the lepton mixing matrix.
Restricting to this setting, in this paper we analyze possible origins for the
effective terms: the type I See-Saw mechanism is the best known approach, but
also the type II and III are discussed. The phenomenology related to these
models is various and the next future experiments could in principle
discriminate among these proposals. Furthermore, we compare our realizations to
two relevant A4 based models, also predicting the Tri-Bimaximal lepton mixing,

could distinguish among all these realizations. Furthermore a combined
measurement of the effective mass and of the lightest neutrino mass could
indicate in the next future which is the preferred flavour symmetry group. The
introduction of new physics beyond the Standard Model, like heavy right-handed
neutrinos, scalar triplets and fermion triplets, let us investigate on

set of autonomous mobile robots. The former consists in distinguishing a unique

be necessary in order to achieve more complex tasks. In this paper, we study
the relationship between these two tasks in a model, called CORDA, wherein the
robots are weak in several aspects. In particular, they are fully asynchronous
and they have no direct means of communication. They cannot remember any
previous observation nor computation performed in any previous step. Such
robots are said to be oblivious. The robots are also uniform and anonymous,
i.e, they all have the same program using no global parameter (such as an
identity) allowing to differentiate any of them. Moreover, we assume that none
of them share any kind of common coordinate mechanism or common sense of
direction and we discuss the influence of a common handedness (i.e.,
chirality). In such a system, Flochini et al. proved in [11] that it is
possible to elect a leader for n \geq 3 robots if it is possible to form any
pattern for n \geq 3. In this paper, we show that the converse is true for n

properties observed from a number of Galactic Black Hole (BH) binaries during
hard-soft state spectral evolution. We analyze 17 transition episodes from 8 BH
sources observed with RXTE. Our scaling technique for BH mass determination
uses a correlation between spectral index and quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO)
frequency. In addition, we use a correlation between index and the
normalization of the disk ""seed"" component to cross-check the BH mass
determination and estimate the distance to the source. While the index-QPO
correlations for two given sources contain information on the ratio of the BH
masses in those sources, the index-normalization correlations depend on the
ratio of the BH masses and the distance square ratio. In fact, the
index-normalization correlation also discloses the index-mass accretion rate
saturation effect given that the normalization of disk ""seed"" photon supply is
proportional to the disk mass accretion rate. We present arguments that this
observationally established index saturation effect is a signature of the bulk
motion (converging) flow onto black hole which was early predicted by the
dynamical Comptonization theory. We use GRO J1655-40 as a primary reference
source for which the BH mass, distance and inclination angle are evaluated by
dynamical measurements with unprecedented precision among other Galactic BH
sources. We apply our scaling technique to determine BH masses and distances
forCygnus X-1, GX 339-4, 4U 1543-47, XTE J1550-564, XTE J1650-500, H 1743-322

of BH masses and distance provides an independent verification for our scaling
technique.

invertible series and a group, under substitution, of non units. The Riordan
near algebra, as introduced in this paper, is the Cartesian product of the
algebra of formal power series and its principal ideal of non units, equipped
with a product that extends the multiplication of the Riordan group. The later
is naturally embedded as a subgroup of units into the former. In this paper, we
prove the existence of a formal calculus on the Riordan algebra. This formal
calculus plays a role similar to those of holomorphic calculi in the Banach or
Fr\'echet algebras setting, but without the constraint of a radius of
convergence. Using this calculus, we define \emph{en passant} a notion of
generalized powers in the Riordan group.

average drift rate of about 0.3 deg/yr following the drift of the geomagnetic
field configuration. Superimposed to this drift rate are irregularities, where
the SAA suddenly moves eastwards and where furthermore the speed of the drift
changes. The most prominent of these irregularities is found in the second
quarter of 2003 and another event took place in 1999. We suggest that these
events are previously unrecognized manifestations of the geomagnetic jerks of
the Earth's magnetic field.

magnetic stresses (the Blandford-Znajek mechanism). In this paper we explore
whether this process can explain the stellar explosions and relativistic jets

Blandford-Znajek mechanism is activated when the rest mass-energy density of
matter drops below the energy density of magnetic field in the very vicinity of

magnetic field is in conflict with the rapid rotation of stellar core required
in the collapsar model and suggest that the conflict can be avoided if the
progenitor star is a component of close binary. In this case the stellar
rotation can be sustained via spin-orbital interaction. In an alternative
scenario the magnetic field is generated in the accretion disk but in this case
the magnetic flux through the black hole ergosphere is not expected to be
sufficiently high to explain the energetics of hypernovae by the BZ mechanism
alone. However, this energy deficit can be recovered via additional power
provided by the disk.

LF) and Lya equivalent width (EW) distribution of Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs)
in the framework of the hierarchical clustering model of galaxy formation. The
model parameters about LAEs were determined by fitting to the observed Lya LF
at z=5.7 in our previous study, and the fit indicates that extinction of Lya
photons by dust is significantly less effective than that of UV continuum
photons, implying clumpy dust distribution in interstellar medium. We then
compare the predictions about UV LFs and EW distributions with a variety of
observations at z ~ 3-6, allowing no more free parameters and paying careful
attention to the selection conditions of LAEs in each survey. We find that the
predicted UV LFs and EW distributions are in nice agreement with observed data,
and especially, our model naturally reproduces the existence of large EW LAEs
(> 240 A) without introducing Pop III stars or top-heavy initial mass function.
We show that both the stellar population (young age and low metallicity) and
extinction by clumpy dust are the keys to reproduce large EW LAEs. The evidence
of EW enhancement by clumpy dust is further strengthened by the quantitative
agreement between our model and recent observations about a positive
correlation between EW and extinction. The observed trend that brighter LAEs in
UV continuum tend to have smaller mean EW is also reproduced, and the clumpy
dust is playing an important role again for this trend. We suggested in our
previous study that the transmission of intergalactic medium for Lya emission
rapidly decreases from z ~ 6 to 7 by the fitting to Lya LFs, and this evidence
is quantitatively strengthened by the comparison with the UV LF and EW
distribution at z ~ 6.6.

efficient ways of finding the optimal couplings in these models and examine

subsets of size up to 200 neurons, essentially exactly, using Boltzmann
learning. We then study the quality of several approximate methods for finding
the couplings by comparing their results with those found from Boltzmann
learning. Two of these methods- inversion of the TAP equations and an
approximation proposed by Sessak and Monasson- are remarkably accurate. Using
these approximations for larger subsets of neurons, we find that extracting
couplings using data from a subset smaller than the full network tends
systematically to overestimate their magnitude. This effect is described
qualitatively by infinite-range spin glass theory for the normal phase. We also
show that a globally-correlated input to the neurons in the network lead to a
small increase in the average coupling. However, the pair-to-pair variation of
the couplings is much larger than this and reflects intrinsic properties of the
network. Finally, we study the quality of these models by comparing their
entropies with that of the data. We find that they perform well for small
subsets of the neurons in the network, but the fit quality starts to
deteriorate as the subset size grows, signalling the need to include higher
order correlations to describe the statistics of large networks.

are accelerated once at the base of the jet, and are cooled by synchrotron
emission and possible adiabatic energy losses. The accelerated electrons assume
a Maxwellian distribution at low energies and possible energetic power law
tail. These assumptions yield to a wealth of spectra, which we study in
details. We identify critical values of the magnetic field, and five transition
frequencies in the spectra. In particular, we show that: (I) the decay of the
magnetic field along the jet enables, for wide jets, production of flat radio
spectra without the need for electrons re-acceleration along the jet. (II) An
increase of the magnetic field above a critical value of ~10^5 G leads to a
sharp decrease in the flux at the radio band, while the flux at higher
frequencies saturates to a constant value. (III) For strong magnetic field, the
flux decays in the optical/UV band as F_nu ~ nu^{-1/2}, irrespective of the
electrons initial distribution. (IV) For B_0 ~ 10^4 G, the X-ray flux gradually
steepens. (V) With adiabatic energy losses, flat spectrum can be obtained only
at a limited frequency range, and under certain conditions (VI) For narrow
jets, r(x) ~ x^{alpha} with alpha < 1/2, flat radio spectrum cannot be
obtained. We provide full description of the spectrum in the different

sources. The proper description of these media in stationary cases requires to
solve linear systems of thousands or more rate equations. A possible
simplification for this arduous numerical task may lie in some type of
statistical average, such as configuration or superconfiguration average.
However to assess the validity of this procedure and to handle cases where
isolated lines play an important role, it may be important to deal with
detailed levels systems. This involves matrices with sometimes billions of
elements, which are rather sparse but still involve thousands of diagonals. We
propose here a numerical algorithm based on the LU decomposition for such
linear systems. This method turns out to be orders of magnitude faster than the
traditional Gauss elimination. And at variance with alternate methods based on
conjugate gradients or minimization, no convergence or accuracy issues have
been faced. Some examples are discussed in connection with the krypton and
tungsten cases discussed at the last NLTE meeting. Furthermore, to assess the
validity of configuration average, several criteria are discussed. While a
criterion based on detailed balance is relevant in cases not too far from LTE
but insufficient otherwise, an alternate criterion based on the use of a
fictive configuration temperature is proposed and successfully tested. It
appears that detailed calculations are sometimes necessary, which supports the
search for an efficient solver as the one proposed here.

datasets available in the GOODS fields, we identify 2443 B, 506 V, and 137
i'-band dropout galaxies likely to be at z~4, 5, and 6. With the goal of
understanding the duration of typical star formation episodes in galaxies at
z>4, we examine the distribution of stellar masses and ages as a function of
cosmic time. We find that at a fixed rest-UV luminosity, the average stellar
masses and ages of galaxies do not increase significantly between z~6 and 4. In
order to maintain this near equilibrium in the average properties of high
redshift LBGs, we argue that there must be a steady flux of young,
newly-luminous objects at each successive redshift. When considered along with
the short duty cycles inferred from clustering measurements, these results may
suggest that galaxies are undergoing star formation episodes lasting only
several hundred million years. In contrast to the unchanging relationship
between the average stellar mass and rest-UV luminosity, we find that the
number density of massive galaxies increases considerably with time over 4<z<6.
Given this rapid increase of UV luminous massive galaxies, we explore the
possibility that a significant fraction of massive (M*>1e11 Msun) z~2-3 distant
red galaxies (DRGs) were in part assembled in an LBG phase at earlier times.
Integrating the growth in the stellar mass function of actively forming LBGs
over 4<z<6 down to z~2, we find that z>3 LBGs could have contributed
significantly to the quiescent DRG population, indicating that the intense
star-forming systems probed by current sub-millimeter observations are not the
only route toward the assembly of DRGs at z~2.

Bogoliubov excitations. We find that Bogoliubov phonons twist the condensate
phase due to a back-reaction effect, which induces the Josephson supercurrent.
While the total current given by the sum of quasiparticle current and induced
supercurrent is conserved, the quasiparticle current flowing through the
barrier potential is shown to be remarkably enhanced in the low energy region.
When the condensate densities are different between the left and right of the
barrier, the excess quasiparticle current, as well as the induced supercurrent,
remains finite far away from the barrier. We also consider the tunneling of
excitations and atoms through the boundary between the normal and superfluid
regions. We show that supercurrent can be generated inside the condensate by
injecting free atoms from outside. On the other hand, atoms are emitted when

regulatory networks to reproduce given expression levels within a simple model
of gene regulation. We find an exponentially large space of regulatory networks
compatible with a given set of expression levels, giving rise to an extensive
entropy of networks. Typical realisations of regulatory networks are found to
share a bias towards symmetric interactions, in line with empirical evidence.

eight dimensions. We find there are cases where the linear analysis breaks
down. If we restrict ourselves to the regime where the linear analysis is
legitimate, black holes are always stable in seven dimensions. However, in
eight dimensions, there exists a critical mass below which black holes are
unstable. Combining our result in the third order Lovelock theory with the

generating a finite density of states at the Fermi surface and a perfect

with the X-ray emission leading the optical by 28 days. The X-ray power density
spectrum is best fit by a broken power law, with a low-frequency slope of -1.2,
breaking to a high-frequency slope of -2.1, and a break frequency of log
nu_b=-5.75 Hz, or 6.5 days. This value agrees well with the value expected
based on 3C 120's mass and accretion rate. We find no evidence for a second
break in the power spectrum. Combined with a moderately soft X-ray spectrum
(Gamma=1.8) and a moderately high accretion rate (mdot / mdot_Edd ~ 0.3), this
indicates that 3C 120 fits in wellwith the high/soft variability state found in
most other AGNs. Previous studies have shown that the spectrum has a strong Fe
K-alpha line, which may be relativistically broadened. The presence of this
line, combined with a power spectrum similar to that seen in Seyfert galaxies,
suggests that the majority of the X-ray emission in this object arises in or

with X-ray counterparts in the catalog of the 1Ms exposure of the central 0.08
deg^2 (Giacconi et al. 2002; Alexander et al. 2003) or in the catalog of the
250 ks exposure of the 0.3 deg^2 E-CDFS field (Lehmer et al. 2005). For 76
(85%) of these sources we have spectroscopic or photometric redshifts, and
therefore we are able to derive their intrinsic properties from X-ray spectral
analysis, namely intrinsic absorption and total X-ray luminosities. We find
that the population of submillijansky radio sources with X-ray counterparts is
composed of a mix of roughly 1/3 star forming galaxies and 2/3 AGN. The
distribution of intrinsic absorption among X-ray detected radio sources is
different from that of the X-ray selected sample. Namely, the fraction of low
absorption sources is at least two times larger than that of X-ray selected
sources in the CDFS. This is mostly due to the larger fraction of star forming
galaxies present among the X-ray detected radio sources. If we investigate the
distribution of intrinsic absorption among sources with L_X>10^42 erg s^-1 in
the hard 2-10 keV band (therefore in the AGN luminosity regime), we find
agreement between the X-ray population with and without radio emission. In
general, radio detected X-ray AGN are not more heavily obscured than the non
radio detected AGN. This argues against the use of radio surveys as an
efficient way to search for the missing population of strongly absorbed AGN.

ground state to a ferromagnetic groundstate. We formulate an auxiliary
graph-theoretical problem in which domain walls are given by undirected
shortest paths with possibly negative distances. Due to the details of the
mapping, standard shortest-path algorithms cannot be applied. To solve such
shortest-path problems we have to apply minimum-weight perfect-matching
algorithms. We first locate the critical values of the disorder parameters,
where the ferromagnet to spin-glass transition occurs for the two types of the
disorder. For certain values of the disorder parameters close to the respective
critical point, we investigate the system size dependence of the width of the
the average domain-wall energy (~L^\theta) and the average domain-wall length

length up to L=512, we find that both exponents remain constant in the

conformal field theory, where it seems to be possible to relate the exponents

simulation of solar magnetogranulation are used for this. In their properties,
the synthetic unusual profiles with extremely asymmetry are similar to the
unusual profiles observed with a spatial resolution better than 1"" in the
network and internetwork regions. According to our results the unusual profiles
mostly appear in clusters along the polarity inversion lines in the regions of
weak magnetic fields with mixed polarity. As a rule, they are located at the
edges of granules and lanes, and sometimes they are met close to strong
magnetic field concentrations with high velocity and magnetic field strength
gradients. They turned out to appear as clusters in the regions where large
granules disintegrate and new magnetic flux tubes begin to form. The unusual
$V$ profiles may have from one to six lobes. The one-lobe and multilobe
profiles are of the same origin. The processing causing the extreme asymmetry
of the profiles are characterized by one or several polarity reversal along the
line of sight as well as by complicated velocity and field strength gradients.
The greater the number of profile lobes, the greater is the probability of the
field gradient sign change. Hence it follows that the magnetic field should be
very complicated in the regions of formation of extremely asymmetric $V$
profiles. This is confirmed by immediate results of MHD granulation
simulations, which demonstrate the formation of vortices and turbulence by the
velocity shear at down draft edges. These processes add complexity to the
magnetic field structure by mixing field polarities, particularly at the edges
of granules.
