over those from galactic sources is an important open question in astroparticle
physics. A natural candidate is the energy at the 'ankle' in the approximately
power-law energy spectrum which is indicative of a cross-over from a falling
galactic component to a flatter extra-galactic component. The transition can
occur without such flattening but this requires some degree of conspiracy of
the spectral shapes and normalizations of the two components. Nevertheless it
has been argued that extra-galactic sources of cosmic ray protons which undergo
interactions on the CMB can reproduce the energy spectrum below the ankle if
the cross-over energy is as low as the 'second knee' in the spectrum. This low
cross-over model is constrained by direct measurements by the Pierre Auger
Observatory which indicate a heavier composition at these energies. We
demonstrate that upper limits on the cosmic diffuse neutrino flux provide a
complementary constraint on the proton fraction in ultra-high energy
extra-galactic cosmic rays and forthcoming data from IceCube will provide a
definitive test of this model.

sections, in renormalizable Quantum Field Theories are found to obey difference
equations of finite order in Mellin space. It is often easier to calculate
fixed moments for these quantities compared to a direct attempt to derive them
in terms of harmonic sums and their generalizations involving the Mellin
parameter $N$. Starting from a sufficiently large number of given moments, we
establish linear recurrence relations of lowest possible order with polynomial
coefficients of usually high degree. Then these recurrence equations are solved
in terms of d'Alembertian solutions where the involved nested sums are
represented in optimal nested depth. Given this representation, it is then an
easy task to express the result in terms of harmonic sums. In this process we
compactify the result such that no algebraic relations occur among the sums
involved. We demonstrate the method for the QCD unpolarized anomalous
dimensions and massless Wilson coefficients to 3--loop order treating the
contributions for individual color coefficients. For the most complicated
subproblem 5114 moments were needed in order to produce a recurrence of order
35 whose coefficients have degrees up to 938. About four months of CPU time
were needed to establish and solve the recurrences for the anomalous dimensions
and Wilson coefficients on a 2 GHz machine requiring less than 10 GB of memory.
No algorithm is known yet to provide such a high number of moments for 3--loop

in dense plasmas typical of white dwarf atmospheres. Our new model is based on
the unified theory of Stark broadening from Vidal, Cooper, & Smith. For the
first time, we account for the non-ideal effects in a consistent way directly
inside the line profile calculations. The Hummer & Mihalas theory is used to
describe the non-ideal effects due to perturbations on the absorber from
protons and electrons. We use a truncation of the electric microfield
distribution in the quasi-static proton broadening to take into account the
fact that high electric microfields dissociate the upper state of a transition.
This approach represents a significant improvement over previous calculations
that relied on the use of an ad hoc parameter to mimic these non-ideal effects.
We obtain the first model spectra with line profiles that are consistent with
the equation of state. We revisit the properties of DA stars in the range
40,000 K > Teff > 13,000 K by analyzing the optical spectra with our improved
models. The updated atmospheric parameters are shown to differ substantially
from those published in previous studies, with a mean mass shifted by +0.034
Msun. We also show that these revised atmospheric parameters yield absolute
visual magnitudes that remain in excellent agreement with trigonometric
parallax measurements.

pathological as a dynamical system. To understand why this is so, we study the

of the Universe expansion by introducing a scalar field that mimics both dark
matter and dark energy. A crucial feature of the UDM models is the speed of
sound c_\infty, that is the value of the sound speed at late times, on which
structure formation depends. In this paper, we provide the predictions of the
UDM models for the weak lensing signal,with various values of c_\infty. We
consider both the Cosmic Microwave Background and background galaxies at
different redshifts as sources for the weak lensing power spectra. We find that
the power spectra in UDM models are more sensitive to the variations of
c_\infty for sources located at low redshifts. Moreover, we find that for
c_\infty>10^{-3} (in units of the speed of light), the UDM weak lensing
convergence power spectrum C^{\kappa\kappa}(l) for background galaxies is
strongly suppressed with respect to the \LambdaCDM spectrum, particularly at
small angular scales l\gtrsim100.

evidence for a 2D spin liquid in proximity to the metal-insulator transition. A
Gutzwiller wavefunction study of the triangular lattice Heisenberg model with
appropriate four-spin ring exchanges has found that the projected spinon Fermi
sea state has a low variational energy. This wavefunction, together with a
slave particle gauge theory, suggests that such spin liquid possesses spin
correlations that are singular along surfaces in momentum space (""Bose
surfaces""). Signatures of this state, which we refer to as a ""Spin Bose-Metal""
(SBM), are expected to be manifest in quasi-1D ladder systems: The discrete
transverse momenta cut through the 2D Bose surface leading to a distinct
pattern of 1D gapless modes. Here we search for a quasi-1D descendant of the
triangular lattice SBM state by exploring the Heisenberg plus ring model on a
two-leg strip (zigzag chain). Using DMRG, variational wavefunctions, and a
Bosonization analysis, we map out the full phase diagram. Without ring exchange
the model is equivalent to the J_1 - J_2 Heisenberg chain, and we find the
expected Bethe-chain and dimerized phases. Remarkably, moderate ring exchange
reveals a new gapless phase over a large swath of the phase diagram. Spin and
dimer correlations possess particular singular wavevectors and allow us to
identify this phase as the hoped for quasi-1D descendant SBM state. We derive a
low energy theory and find three gapless modes and one Luttinger parameter
controlling all power laws. Potential instabilities out of the zigzag SBM give
rise to other interesting phases such as a period-3 VBS or a period-4 Chirality
order, which we discover in the DMRG; we also find an interesting SBM state
with partial ferromagnetism.

study non-parabolic CR singularities. We show that the presence or absence of
Bishop discs around certain non-parabolic CR singularities is completely
determined by a Maslov-type index. This result subsumes all known facts about
Bishop discs around order-two, non-parabolic CR singularities. Sufficient
conditions for Bishop discs have earlier been investigated at CR singularities
having high order of contact with T_p(S). These results relied upon a
subharmonicity condition, which fails in many simple cases. Hence, we look

Classical T Tauri stars to probe the extent of accretion variations in young

spectra, covering timescales from hours to months. As proxies for the accretion
rate, we use the H-alpha 10% width and the CaII-8662 line flux. We find that
while the two quantities are correlated, their variability amplitude is not.
Converted to accretion rates, the CaII fluxes indicate typical accretion rate
changes of 0.35 dex, with 32% exceeding 0.5 dex, while H-alpha 10% width
suggests changes of 0.65 dex, with 66% exceeding 0.5 dex. We conclude that CaII
fluxes are a more robust quantitative indicator of accretion than H-alpha 10%
width, and that intrinsic accretion rate changes typically do not exceed 0.5
dex on timescales of days to months. The maximum extent of the variability is
reached after a few days, suggesting that rotation is the dominant cause of
variability. We see a decline of the inferred accretion rates towards later
spectral types, reflecting the dM/dt vs. M relationship. There is a gap between
accretors and non-accretors, pointing to a rapid shutdown of accretion. We
conclude that the ~2 orders of magnitude scatter in the dM/dt vs. M
relationship is dominated by object-to-object scatter instead of intrinsic
source variability.

assuming three components: a stellar component to account for the optical and
near-IR emission, an AGN component (i.e., dust heated by an accreting active
nucleus), dominant in the mid-IR, with an optical depth at 9.7 micron along the
line of sight (close to the equatorial plane of the obscuring matter) of
tau(9.7)=1 and a full covering angle of the reprocessing matter (torus) of 140
degrees, and a far-IR starburst component (i.e., dust heated by star formation)

interest because they tend to orbit more massive hosts, and have been subjected
to variable stellar insolation over their recent histories as their primaries
evolved off the main sequence. Unfortunately, we have limited information about
the physical properties of these planets, as they were all detected by the
radial velocity method and none have been observed to transit. Here we evaluate
the prospects for detecting transits of planetary companions to giant stars. We
show that several of the known systems have a priori transit probabilities of
>~ 10%, and about one transiting system is expected for the sample of host
stars with R >= 2.5 R_sun. Although the transits are expected to have very
small amplitudes (~few x 10^-4) and long durations (>~ 50 hrs), we argue that
the difficulty with detecting these signals in broadband light is one of
systematic errors and practicality rather than photon noise, even for modest
aperture ~1m telescopes. We propose a novel method that may overcome these
difficulties, which uses narrow-band measurements to isolate the thin ring of
chromospheric emission expected at the limb of giant stars. The transit signals
in these narrow bands are expected to be larger in magnitude and briefer in
duration than in broad-band emission, and thus alleviating many of the
difficulties with transit detection in broad-band emission. Finally, we point
out that it may be possible to discover planetary companions to giant stars
using Kepler, provided that a sufficient number of such targets are monitored.

that they can produce signals with such short time scales that we must be
probing very close to the innermost stable circular orbit that is predicted by
the theory of General Relativity (GR). These signals are quasi-periodic
oscillations (QPOs), and both the high-frequency variety (HFQPOs, which have
frequencies in the 40-450 Hz range) as well as the 0.1-10 Hz low-frequency type
have the potential to provide tests of GR in the strong field limit. An
important step on the path to GR tests is to constrain the physical black hole
properties, and the straightforward frequency measurements that are possible
with X-ray timing may provide one of the cleanest measurements of black hole
spins. While current X-ray satellites have uncovered these phenomenona, the
HFQPOs are weak signals, and future X-ray timing missions with larger effective
area are required for testing the candidate theoretical QPO mechanisms. Another
main goal in the study of accreting black holes is to understand the production
of relativistic jets. Here, we have also made progress during the past decade
by finding clear connections between the radio emission that traces the
strength of the jet and the properties of the X-ray emission. With new radio
capabilities just coming on-line, continuing detailed X-ray studies of
accreting black holes is crucial for continuing to make progress.

transition: superconductivity and density-wave order. The large positive Nernst

Here we show that in some of these materials the large Nernst signal is in fact
caused by stripe order, a form of spin / charge modulation which causes a
reconstruction of the Fermi surface. In LSCO doped with Nd or Eu, the onset of
stripe order causes the Nernst signal to go from small and negative to large
and positive, as revealed either by lowering the hole concentration across the
quantum critical point in Nd-LSCO, or lowering the temperature across the
ordering temperature in Eu-LSCO. In the latter case, two separate peaks are
resolved, respectively associated with the onset of stripe order at high
temperature and superconductivity near Tc. This sensitivity to Fermi-surface
reconstruction makes the Nernst effect a promising probe of broken symmetry in
high-Tc superconductors.

softening of the spectrum below the peak energy within individual pulses in the

formulated: Given m (possibly) signal bearing, n-dimensional signal-plus-noise

This problem arises in the context of applications as diverse as radar, sonar,
wireless communications, bioinformatics, and machine learning and is the
critical first step in the subsequent signal parameter estimation phase.
  The signal detection problem can be naturally posed in terms of the sample
generalized eigenvalues. The sample generalized eigenvalues correspond to the
eigenvalues of the matrix formed by ""whitening"" the signal-plus-noise sample
covariance matrix with the noise-only sample covariance matrix. In this article
we prove a fundamental asymptotic limit of sample generalized eigenvalue based
detection of signals in arbitrarily colored noise when there are relatively few

  Numerical simulations highlight the accuracy of our analytical prediction and
permit us to extend our heuristic definition of the effective number of

New programs will push to 1% uncertainty in the dark energy equation of state
and tightened constraint on curvature, requiring close attention to
systematics. Direct 1% measurement of the Hubble constant (H0) would provide a
new constraint. It can be obtained without overlapping systematics directly
from recessional velocities and geometric distance estimates for galaxies via
the mapping of water maser emission that traces the accretion disks of nuclear
black holes. We identify redshifts 0.02<z<0.06 as best for small samples, e.g.,
10 widely distributed galaxies, each with 3% distance uncertainty. Knowledge of
peculiar radial motion is also required. Mapping requires very long baseline
interferometry (VLBI) with the finest angular resolution, sensitivity to
individual lines of a few mJy-km/s, and baselines that can detect a complex of
~10 mJy lines (peak) in < 1 min. For 2010-2020, large ground apertures (50-100m
diameter) augmenting the VLBA are critical, such as EVLA, GBT, Effelsberg, and
the Large Millimeter Telescope, for which we propose a 22 GHz receiver and VLBI
instrumentation. A space-VLBI aperture may be required, thus motivating US
participation in the Japanese VSOP-2 mission (launch c.2013). This will provide
3-4x longer baselines and ~5x improvement in distance uncertainty. There are
now 5 good targets at z>0.02, out of ~100 known masers. A single-dish discovery
survey of >10,000 nuclei (>2500 hours on the GBT) would build a sample of tens
of potential distance anchors. Beyond 2020, a high-frequency SKA could provide
larger maser samples, enabling estimation of H0 from individually less accurate

stretching/contraction and the smearing due to noise. We propose to determine
the `finest attainable' partition for a given hyperbolic dynamical system and a
given weak additive white noise, by computing the local eigenfunctions of the
adjoint Fokker-Planck operator along each periodic point, and using overlaps of
their widths as the criterion for an optimal partition. The Fokker-Planck
evolution is then represented by a finite transition graph, whose spectral
determinant yields time averages of dynamical observables. Numerical tests of
such `optimal partition' of a one-dimensional repeller support our hypothesis.

contingency. I then argue that symmetries due to similarly endowed individuals
and similar products are generically broken by the constraints of scarcity,
leading to the existence of multiple equilibria.
  This is followed by an evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the

models.
  Another set of issues has to do with the fundamental meaning of prices and
the related question of what the observables of a non-equilibrium, dynamic
model of an economic market should be. We argue that these issues are addressed
by formulating economics in the language of a gauge theory, as proposed
originally by Malaney and Weinstein. We review some of their work and provide a

at the ESO Paranal observatory. These stars can be classified in three groups
depending on the presence/absence of emission lines and the strength of
Br$\alpha$ and Pf$\gamma$ emission lines relative to those of Humphreys lines
from transitions 6--14 to the end of the series. These groups are
representative of circumstellar envelopes with different optical depths. For
the group showing Br$\alpha$ and Pf$\gamma$ lines stronger than Humphreys
lines, the Humphreys decrement roughly follow the Menzel case-B for optically
thin conditions. For the group showing comparable Br$\alpha$, Pf$\gamma$ and
Humphreys emission line strengths, the Humphreys decrements moves from an
optically thin to an optically thick regime at a transition wavelength which is
characteristic for each star, but typically is located around 3.65--3.75 $\mu$m
(transitions 6--19 and 6--17). Higher order Humphreys lines probe optically
thin inner regions even in the optically thicker envelopes. We find evidence of
larger broadening in the infrared emission lines compared with optical lines,
probably reflecting larger vertical velocity fields near the star. The
existence of the aforementioned groups is in principle consistent with the
proposed description by de Wit et al. (2006) for Be star outbursts in terms of
the ejection of an optically thick disk that expands and becomes optically thin
before dissipation into the interstellar medium. Time resolved L-band
spectroscopy sampling the outburst cycle promises to be an unique tool for
testing Be star disk evolution.

primary design goals are efficient hardware implementation and low
computational load on the supporting digital processing. We propose a system,
named the modulated wideband converter, which first multiplies the analog
signal by a bank of periodic waveforms. The product is then lowpass filtered
and sampled uniformly at a low rate, which is orders of magnitude smaller than
Nyquist. Perfect recovery from the proposed samples is achieved under certain
necessary and sufficient conditions. We also develop a digital architecture,
which allows either reconstruction of the analog input, or processing of any
band of interest at a low rate, that is, without interpolating to the high
Nyquist rate. Numerical simulations demonstrate many engineering aspects:
robustness to noise and mismodeling, potential hardware simplifications,
realtime performance for signals with time-varying support and stability to
quantization effects. We compare our system with two previous approaches:
periodic nonuniform sampling, which is bandwidth limited by existing hardware
devices, and the random demodulator, which is restricted to discrete multitone
signals and has a high computational load. In the broader context of Nyquist
sampling, our scheme has the potential to break through the bandwidth barrier

$e^+e^-$ from dark matter (DM) annihilation in galaxy clusters. Two candidates
of DM particle, (1) the weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP) and (2) the
light dark matter (LDM) are investigated. For each case, we also consider
several DM profiles with and without central cusp. We generally find smaller
signals than previously reported. Moreover, the diffusion of electrons and
positrons in the galaxy clusters, which was generally thought to be negligible,
is considered and found to have significant effect on the central
electron/positron distribution for DM profile with large spatial gradient. We
find that the SZ effect from WIMP is almost always non-observable, even for the
highly cuspy DM profile, and using the next generation SZ interferometer such
as ALMA. Although the signal of the LDM is much larger than that of the WIMP,
the final SZ effect is still very small due to the smoothing effect of
diffusion. Only for the configuration with large central cusp and extremely
small diffusion effect, the LDM induced SZ effect might have a bit chance of
being detected.

O}(10^{-8})$ for the latter decay is too small by three to four orders of
magnitude compared to experiment. Previously, it has been shown that a large
enhancement for the $\Lambda_c^+\bar\Lambda_c^-\bar K$ production can occur due
to a charmonium-like resonance (e.g. X(4630) discovered by Belle) with a mass
near the $\Lambda_c\bar\Lambda_c$ threshold. Motivated by the BaBar's
observation of a resonance in the $\Lambda_c \bar K$ system with a mass of
order 2930 MeV, we study in this work the contribution to $\bar
B\to\Lambda_c^+\bar\Lambda_c^-\bar K$ from the intermediate state $\Xi_c(2980)$
which is postulated to be a first positive-parity excited $D$-wave charmed
baryon state. Assuming that a soft $q\bar q$ quark pair is produced through the
$\sigma$ and $\pi$ meson exchanges in the configuration for $\bar B\to
\Xi_c(2980)\bar\Lambda_c$ and $\Lambda_c\bar\Lambda_c$, it is found that
branching ratios of $\bar B\to \Lambda_c^+\bar \Lambda_c^- \bar K$ and $\bar
B\to \Lambda_c^+\bar \Lambda_c^-$ are of order $3.5\times 10^{-4}$ and $5\times
10^{-5}$, respectively, in agreement with experiment except that the prediction
for the $\Lambda_c\bar\Lambda_c K^-$ is slightly smaller. In conjunction with
our previous analysis, we conclude that the enormously large rate of $\bar B\to
\Lambda_c^+\bar \Lambda_c^-\bar K$ arises from the resonances $\Xi_c(2980)$ and
X(4630).

transition remains first order down to a thickness of four FCC cells. It
becomes clearly second order at a thickness of two FCC cells, i.e. four atomic

the ground state (GS) degeneracy found in the bulk. For the two-cell thickness,
the surface magnetization is larger than the interior one. It undergoes a
second-order phase transition at a temperature $T_C$ while interior spins
become disordered at a lower temperature $T_D$. This loss of order is
characterized by a peak of the interior spins susceptibility and a peak of the
specific heat which do not depend on the lattice size suggesting that either it
is not a real transition or it is a Kosterlitz-Thouless nature. The surface
transition, on the other hand, is shown to be of second order with critical
exponents deviated from those of pure 2D Ising universality class. We also show

model involving the bilayer-split (bonding and antibonding) bands. An emphasis
is on the gauge-invariance of the theory, which turns out to be essential for
the physical understanding of the electrodynamics of these compounds. The
description of the optical response involves local (intra-bilayer and
inter-bilayer) current densities and local conductivities. The local
conductivities are obtained using a microscopic theory, where the
quasiparticles of the two bands are coupled to spin fluctuations. The coupling
leads to superconductivity and is described at the level of generalized
Eliashberg theory. Also addressed is the simpler case of quasiparticles coupled
by a separable and nonretarded interaction. The gauge invariance of the theory
is achieved by including a suitable class of vertex corrections. The resulting
response of the model is studied in detail and an interpretation of two
superconductivity-induced peaks in the experimental data of the real part of
the c-axis conductivity is proposed. The peak around 400/cm is attributed to a
collective mode of the intra-bilayer regions, that is an analogue of the
Bogolyubov-Anderson mode playing a crucial role in the theory of the
longitudinal response of superconductors. For small values of the bilayer
splitting, its nature is similar to that of the transverse plasmon of the
phenomenological Josephson superlattice model. The peak around 1000/cm is
interpreted as a pair breaking-feature that is related to the electronic
coupling through the spacing layers separating the bilayers.

peak in the spectral amplification factor and therefore to the appearance of
the SR phenomenon. We have proved that the amplification factor depends on the
shape of the region through which the particle moves and that by adjusting its
characteristic geometric parameters one may optimize the response of the
system. The situation in which the appearance of such entropic stochastic

and noise play an prominent role. The novel mechanism found could thus

concentrates on the error in an out-of-sample prediction of the response for a

prediction error depend on the smoothness of the slope function and on the

sense that they are minimax over large classes of possible slope functions and
distributions of the predictive curves. For the case of models with
errors-in-variables the smoothing spline estimator is modified by using a
denoising correction of the covariance matrix of discretized curves. The

relatively slowly, and yet displays episodic Halpha emission. Such behaviour is
typical of a classical Be star. For some time this posed a contradiction to our
understanding of the Be phenomena as rapid rotation is thought to be a
prerequisite for the emission phases of Be stars. Recent work has demonstrated
that the Halpha emission is in fact due to a close companion (separation
~0.25"") of the star. This resolves the apparent enigma if this close companion
is a classical Be star. We aim to test the hypothesis that this close companion
is a valid Be star by determining properties such as its spectral type and vsin
i. We employed spectroastrometry to investigate the close binary system. Using
the spectroastrometric signatures observed, we split the composite binary
spectra into its constituent spectra in the B band and R band. The split
spectra allow us to estimate spectral types of the binary components. We find
that the primary of the close binary system has a spectral type of B2III and
the secondary a spectral type of B5Ve. From the relationship between mass and
spectral type, we determine the masses of the binary components to be M_p =
12.6+/-3.2 M_* and M_s = 4.4+/-0.7 M_* respectively. The spectroastrometric
data allow some constraint on the orbit, and we suggest a moderate revision to
the previously determined orbit. We confirm that the primary of the system is a
slow rotator (vsin i =29 +43/-29 km/s), while the secondary rotates
significantly faster, at a vsin i =230+/-45 km/s. We show that the close
companion to the beta Cep primary is a valid classical Be star. It has a
spectral type of B5Ve and is a relatively fast rotator.

describe rational conformal field theories, making use of Frobenius algebras
and their representations in modular categories. Given a modular category C, a
rational conformal field theory can be constructed from a Frobenius algebra A
in C. We show that if C contains a symmetric special Frobenius algebra A such
that the torus partition function Z(A) of the corresponding conformal field
theory is non-trivial, implying reducibility of the genus 1 representation of
the modular group, then the representation of the genus g mapping class group
constructed from C is reducible for every g\geq 1. We also extend the number of
examples where we can show reducibility significantly by establishing the
existence of algebras with the required properties using methods developed by
Fuchs, Runkel and Schweigert. As a result we show that the quantum
representations are reducible in the SU(N) case, N>2, for all levels k\in

fixed model nor is it a linear estimator. Instead, approximate solutions are
constructed by projections onto a nested set of data-dependent subspaces. To
prove consistency, we exploit the known fact that Partial Least Squares is
equivalent to the conjugate gradient algorithm in combination with early
stopping. The choice of the stopping rule (number of iterations) is a crucial
point. We study two empirical stopping rules. The first one monitors the
estimation error in each iteration step of Partial Least Squares, and the

FP have stellar populations systematically older and with alpha over-abundances
larger than average, for their sigma_0. Including alpha/Fe as a fourth
parameter in the FP, the total scatter decreases from 0.088 dex to 0.075 dex
and the estimated intrinsic scatter decreases from 0.068 dex to 0.049 dex.
Thus, variations in alpha/Fe account for >> 30% of the total variance around
the FP, and >> 50% of the estimated intrinsic variance. This result indicates
that the distribution of galaxies around the FP are tightly related to the
enrichment, and hence to the timescale of star-formation. Our results appear to
be consistent with the merger hypothesis for the formation of ellipticals which
predicts that a significant fraction of the scatter is due to variations in the
importance of dissipation in forming merger remnants of a given mass.

two main characteristics. First, it utilises each galaxy's full redshift
probability function, instead of an estimate of the photometric redshift based
on the peak of the probability function and an associated Gaussian error.
Second, it identifies cluster candidates through cross-checking the results of
two substantially different selection techniques (the name 2TecX representing
the cross-check of the two techniques). These are adaptations of the Voronoi
Tesselations and Friends-Of-Friends methods. Monte-Carlo simulations of mock
catalogues show that cross-checking the cluster candidates found by the two
techniques significantly reduces the detection of spurious sources.
Furthermore, we examine the selection effects and relative strengths and
weaknesses of either method. The simulations also allow us to fine-tune the
algorithm's parameters, and define completeness and mass limit as a function of
redshift. We demonstrate that the algorithm isolates high-redshift clusters at
a high level of efficiency and low contamination.

described by phenomenological or simplified models. We propose a study of the
spectral emission from the high mass X-ray binary pulsar 4U 0115+634 by means
of thermal and bulk Comptonization models based on the physical properties of
such objects. For this purpose, we analyze the BeppoSAX data in the energy
range 0.7-100 keV of the 1999 giant outburst, 12 days after the maximum. We
model the spectral energy distribution of the system using a two-component
continuum. At higher energy, above ~7 keV, the emission is due to thermal and
bulk Comptonization of the seed photons produced by cyclotron cooling of the
accretion column, and at lower energy, the emission is due to thermal
Comptonization of a blackbody source in a diffuse halo close to the stellar
surface. From the best fit parameters, we argue that the cyclotron emission is
produced ~1.7 km above the stellar surface, and escapes from the column near
its base, where the absorption features are generated by the interaction with
the magnetic field in a surrounding halo. We find that in 4U 0115+634, the
observed spectrum is dominated by reprocessed cyclotron radiation, whereas in
other bright sources with stronger magnetic fields such as Her X-1, the
spectrum is dominated by reprocessed bremsstrahlung.
