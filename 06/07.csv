invariant theory under the full group of four-dimensional diffeomorphisms. In
this respect, although being fully relativistic, it results to be locally
anisotropic in the time-like and space-like directions defined by a family of
irrotational observers. We show that this theory propagates generically three
degrees of freedom: two of them are related to the four-dimensional
diffeomorphism invariant graviton (the metric) and one is related to a
propagating scalar mode. Finally, we note that in the present formulation,
matter can be consistently coupled to gravity.

perihelic precession is presented. Orbital motion in the Schwarzschild geometry
is considered in the Keplerian limit, and the orbit equation is derived for
approximately elliptical motion. The method of solution makes use of coordinate
transformations and the correspondence principle, rather than the standard
perturbative approach. The form of the resulting orbit equation is similar to
that derived from Newtonian mechanics and includes first-order corrections to
Kepler's orbits due to general relativity. The associated relativistic
contribution to perihelic precession agrees with established first-order
results. The reduced radius for the circular orbit is in agreement to
first-order with that calculated from the Schwarzschild effective potential.
The method of solution is understandable by undergraduate students.

on the asymptotic distribution theory. The purpose of this paper is to provide
theoretical justifications for the use of bootstrap as a semiparametric

imitates the distribution of the $M$-estimate. We also show that the bootstrap
confidence set has the asymptotically correct coverage probability. These

of dark matter halos to their spatial clustering. Testing this argument
requires an accurate determination of the halo mass function. We present a
Maximum Likelihood method for fitting parametric functional forms to halo
abundances which differs from previous work because it does not require binned
counts. Our conclusions do not depend on whether we use our method or more
conventional ones. In addition, halo abundances depend on how halos are
defined. Our conclusions do not depend on the choice of link length associated
with the friends-of-friends halo-finder, nor do they change if we identify
halos using a spherical overdensity algorithm instead. The large scale halo
bias measured from the matter-halo cross spectrum b_x and the halo
autocorrelation function b_xi (on scales k~0.03h/Mpc and r ~50 Mpc/h) can
differ by as much as 5% for halos that are significantly more massive than the
characteristic mass M*. At these large masses, the peak background split
estimate of the linear bias factor b1 is 3-5% smaller than b_xi, which is 5%
smaller than b_x. We discuss the origin of these discrepancies: deterministic
nonlinear local bias, with parameters determined by the peak-background split
argument, is unable to account for the discrepancies we see. A simple linear
but nonlocal bias model, motivated by peaks theory, may also be difficult to
reconcile with our measurements. More work on such nonlocal bias models may be
needed to understand the nature of halo bias at this level of precision.

re-expressed in a parameter space consisting of logarithm of dimensionless
accretion rate versus that of the BH mass. It turns out that the FR I/II

using the variational principle we have shown the analogy between a quantum
harmonic oscillator with that of the nucleation of superconductivity in bulk
and a quantum double oscillator with that of the nucleation at the surface of a
finite sample. The effective Hamiltonian approach of Cook {\it et al}
\cite{cook} is employed to incorporate the effect of an externally applied

calculated from the ground state energy method. The results obtained from these
two approximated theories agree very well with the exact results for the case
of undriven system which establishes the validity of these two approximated
theories. It is observed that the highly oscillating electric field actually
increases the bulk critical nucleation field ($H_{c_2}$) as well as the surface
critical nucleation field ($H_{c_3}$) of superconductivity as compared to the
case of absence of electric field ($\varepsilon_0=0$). But the externally
applied rapidly oscillating electric field accentuates the surface critical
nucleation field more than the bulk critical nucleation field i.e. the increase
of $H_{c_3}$ is 1.6592 times larger than that of $H_{c_2}$.

velocities which cross and exceed the speed of sound by an order of magnitude.
The Landau critical velocity is therefore surpassed. The point where the flow
velocity equals the speed of sound is the sonic event horizon. The effective
gravity is determined from the profiles of the velocity and speed of sound. A
simulation finds negative energy excitations, by means of Bragg spectroscopy.

single transmitter sends a common message to two receivers and a private
message to one of the receivers only. The main goal of this work is to find new
lower bounds to the error exponents of the strong user, the one that should
decode both messages, and of the weak user, that should decode only the common
message. Unlike previous works, where suboptimal decoders where used, the
exponents we derive in this work pertain to optimal decoding and depend on both
rates. We take two different approaches.
  The first approach is based, in part, on variations of Gallager-type bounding
techniques that were presented in a much earlier work on error exponents for
erasure/list decoding. The resulting lower bounds are quite simple to
understand and to compute.
  The second approach is based on a technique that is rooted in statistical
physics, and it is exponentially tight from the initial step and onward. This
technique is based on analyzing the statistics of certain enumerators.
Numerical results show that the bounds obtained by this technique are tighter
than those obtained by the first approach and previous results. The derivation,
however, is more complex than the first approach and the retrieved exponents
are harder to compute.

of electrons in solids having entangled band structure. The procedure starts
with dividing the Hilbert space into two subspaces, the low-energy part (""$d$
space'') and the rest of the space (""$r$ space''). The low-energy model is
constructed for the $d$ space by eliminating the degrees of freedom of the $r$
space. The thus derived model contains the strength of electron correlation
expressed by a partially screened Coulomb interaction, calculated in the
constrained random-phase-approximation (cRPA) where screening channels within
the $d$ space, $P_d$, are subtracted. One conceptual problem of this
established downfolding method is that for entangled bands it is not clear how
to cut out the $d$ space and how to distinguish $P_d$ from the total
polarization. Here, we propose a simple procedure to overcome this difficulty.
In our scheme, the $d$ subspace is cut out from the Hilbert space of the Kohn
Sham eigenfunctions with the help of a procedure to construct a localized
Wannier basis. The $r$ subspace is constructed as the complementary space
orthogonal to the $d$ subspace. After this disentanglement, $P_d$ becomes well
defined. Using the disentangled bands, the effective parameters are uniquely
determined in the cRPA. The method is successfully applied to 3$d$ transition
metals.

\leq 359^{\circ}$ and $0^{\circ} \leq b \leq 2^{\circ}$. The large velocity
dispersions of 50--100 km s$^{-1}$ of this feature are much larger than those
in the Galactic disk and indicate that the feature is located in the Galactic
center, probably within $\sim1$ kpc of Sgr A$^{*}$. The distribution has a
projected length of $\sim600$ pc and height of $\sim300$ pc from the Galactic
disk and shows a large-scale monotonic velocity gradient of $\sim130$ km s
$^{-1}$ per $\sim600$ pc. The feature is also associated with HI gas having a
more continuous spatial and velocity distribution than that of $^{12}$CO. We
interpret the feature as a magnetically floated loop similar to loops 1 and 2
and name it ""loop 3"". Loop 3 is similar to loops 1 and 2 in its height and
length but is different from loops 1 and 2 in that the inner part of loop 3 is
filled with molecular emission. We have identified two foot points at the both
ends of loop 3. HI, $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO datasets were used to estimate the
total mass and kinetic energy of loop 3 to be $\sim3.0 \times 10^{6} \Mo$ and
$\sim1.7 \times 10^{52}$ ergs. The huge size, velocity dispersions and energy
are consistent with the magnetic origin the Parker instability as in case of
loops 1 and 2 but is difficult to be explained by multiple stellar explosions.
We argue that loop 3 is in an earlier evolutionary phase than loops 1 and 2
based on the inner-filled morphology and the relative weakness of the foot
points. This discovery indicates that the western part of the nuclear gas disk
of $\sim1$ kpc radius is dominated by the three well-developed magnetically
floated loops and suggests that the dynamics of the nuclear gas disk is
strongly affected by the magnetic instabilities.

linear program. This problem has been studied before and a state-of-the-art SGA
heuristic with two variations have been proposed.
  In this paper we apply a new approach to evaluate the quality of SGA\@. In
particular, we solve majority of the instances in the testbed to optimality
using a new fixed-parameter algorithm, i.e., an algorithm whose runtime is
polynomial in the input size but exponential in terms of an additional
parameter associated with the given problem.
  This analysis allows us to conclude that the the existing SGA heuristic, in
fact, produces solutions of a very high quality and often reaches the optimal
objective values. However, SGA contain two components which leave some space
for improvement: building of a spanning tree and searching for an independent
set in a graph. In the hope of obtaining even better heuristic, we tried to
replace both of these components with some equivalent algorithms.
  We tried to use a fixed-parameter algorithm instead of a greedy one for
searching of an independent set. But even the exact solution of this subproblem
improved the whole heuristic insignificantly. Hence, the crucial part of SGA is
building of a spanning tree. We tried three different algorithms, and it
appears that the Depth-First search is clearly superior to the other ones in
building of the spanning tree for SGA.
  Thereby, by application of fixed-parameter algorithms, we managed to check
that the existing SGA heuristic is of a high quality and selected the component
which required an improvement. This allowed us to intensify the research in a
proper direction which yielded a superior variation of SGA.

entropy estimator when generalised to cope with entropic forms customarily
applied to study systems evincing asymptotic scale invariance and dependence
(either linear or non-linear type). We show that when the variables are
independently and identically distributed the estimator is only valuable along
the whole domain if the data follow the uniform distribution, whereas for other
distributions the estimator is only effectual in the limit of the
Boltzmann-Gibbs-Shanon entropic form. We also analyse the influence of the
dependence (linear and non-linear) between variables on the accuracy of the
estimator between variables. As expected in the last case the estimator looses
efficiency for the Boltzmann-Gibbs-Shanon entropic form as well.

radio/X-ray sources in the RASS-Green Bank (RGB) catalog which have been
spectroscopically observed in the Sloan digital sky survey (SDSS) DR5. For 72
sources, the identifications for are presented for the first time. It is
confirmed that the majority of strong radio/X-ray emitters are radio-loud
active galactic nuclei (AGNs), particularly blazars. Taking advantage of the
high spectral quality and resolution and our refined spectral modeling, we are
able to disentangle narrow line radio galaxies (NLRGs), as vaguely termed in
most previous identification work, into Seyfert II galaxies and LINERs, based
on the standard emission line diagnostics. The NLRGs in the RGB sample, mostly
belonging to `weak line radio galaxies', are found have optical spectra
consistent predominantly with LINERs, and only a small fraction with Seyfert II
galaxies. A small number of LINERs have radio power as high as
$10^{23}-10^{26}$ \whz at 5 GHz, being among the strongest radio emitting
LINERs known so far. Two sources are identified with radio-loud narrow line
Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s), a class of rare objects. The presence is also
confirmed of flat-spectrum radio quasars with the radio--optical--X-ray
effective spectral indices similar to those of High-energy peaked BL Lac (HBL),
albeit it is yet a debate as to whether this is the case for their actual
spectral energy distributions.

stationary quantum Hamilton-Jacobi equation is well known in the literature.
The extension to higher dimensions in the separated variable case was proposed
in contradictory formulations. In this paper we provide new insights into the
construction of the reduced action. In particular, contrary to the classical
mechanics case, we analytically show that the reduced action constructed as a
sum of one variable functions does not contain a complete information about the
quantum motion. In the same context, we also make some observations about
recent results concerning quantum trajectories. Finally, we will examine the
conditions in which microstates appear even in the case where the wave function
is complex.
