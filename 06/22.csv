The main idea is to steer the transmit beamforming matrices such that at each
receiver the subspace dimensions occupied by interference-free desired streams
are asymptotically the same as those occupied by all interferences. Our
proposed scheme achieves a higher multiplexing gain at any given number of
channel realizations in comparison with the original IA scheme, which is known
to achieve the optimal multiplexing gain asymptotically.

how shape asymmetry influences the vortex reversal in arrays of sub-micron

particular sites under different field orientations and cycle sequences. The
vortex annihilation field and degree of chirality control depend sensitively on
the angular position of the applied field relative to the flat edge of the

larger than that found from the half loop and the vortex chirality can be well
controlled. At intermediate angles the chirality control is lost and an
interesting crossover in the annihilation field is found: the half loop
actually extrudes outside of the major loop, exhibiting a larger vortex
annihilation field. At large angles the annihilation fields along major and

suspended in it usually deposit in a ring-like pattern. This phenomenon is
commonly referred to as the ""coffee-ring"" effect. One paradigm for why this
occurs is as a consequence of the solutes being transported towards the pinned
contact line by the flow inside the drop, which is induced by surface
evaporation. From this perspective, the role of the liquid-gas interface in
shaping the deposition pattern is somewhat minimized. Here, we propose an
alternative mechanism for the coffee-ring deposition. It is based on the bulk
flow within the drop transporting particles to the interface where they are
captured by the receding free surface and subsequently transported along the
interface until they are deposited near the contact line. That the interface
captures the solutes as the evaporation proceeds is supported by a Lagrangian
tracing of particles advected by the flow field within the droplet. We model
the interfacial adsorption and transport of particles as a one-dimensional
advection-generation process in toroidal coordinates and show that the theory
reproduces ring-shaped depositions. Using this model, deposition patterns on
both hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces are examined in which the evaporation
is modeled as being either diffusive or uniform over the surface.

realistic CMB spectrum, we generate the initial conditions for our N-body
simulations, which follow the spatial distributions of the dark matter and the
scalar field by solving their equations of motion using the multilevel adaptive
grid technique. We show that the spatial configuration of the scalar field
tracks well the voids and clusters of dark matter. Indeed, the propagation of
scalar degree of freedom effectively acts a fifth force on dark matter
particles, whose range and magnitude are determined by the two model parameters
(mu, gamma), local dark matter density as well as the background value for the
scalar field. The model behaves like the LCDM paradigm on scales relevant to
the CMB spectrum, which are well beyond the probe of the local fifth force and
thus not significantly affected by the matter-scalar coupling. On scales
comparable or shorter than the range of the local fifth force, the fifth force
is perfectly parallel to gravity and their strengths have a fixed ratio
2gamma^2 determined by the matter-scalar coupling, provided that the chameleon
effect is weak; if on the other hand there is a strong chameleon effect (i.e.,
the scalar field almost resides at its effective potential minimum everywhere
in the space), the fifth force indeed has suppressed effects in high density
regions and shows no obvious correlation with gravity, which means that the
dark-matter-scalar-field coupling is not simply equivalent to a rescaling of
the gravitational constant or the mass of the dark matter particles.

discussed: spacecraft charging and radiation hazards to spacecraft electronics,
with emphasis on the natural environmental factors and interactions which
contribute to these hazards. Following a summary of the historical eras of
spacecraft charging and some observations from experimental satellites: SCATHA,
CRRES and DMSP, environmental factors significant to spacecraft charging are
discussed, including plasma interactions, electric and magnetic fields and
solar radiation. Spacecraft charging depends on the spacecraft geometry, as

differ for each type of orbit. Low altitude orbiting satellites (LEO) usually
experience less charging effects than high altitude geosynchronous (GEO)

impact upon the effective capacity of several system parameters, including
channel sensing duration, detection threshold, detection and false alarm
probabilities, QoS parameters, and transmission rates, is investigated. The
performances of fixed-rate and variable-rate transmission methods are compared
in the presence of QoS limitations. It is shown that variable schemes
outperform fixed-rate transmission techniques if the detection probabilities
are high. Performance gains through adapting the power and rate are quantified
and it is shown that these gains diminish as the QoS limitations become more
stringent.

  Channel Uncertainty",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Energy efficiency of fixed-rate transmissions is studied in the presence of
queueing constraints and channel uncertainty. It is assumed that neither the
transmitter nor the receiver has channel side information prior to
transmission. The channel coefficients are estimated at the receiver via
minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) estimation with the aid of training symbols.
It is further assumed that the system operates under statistical queueing
constraints in the form of limitations on buffer violation probabilities. The
optimal fraction of power allocated to training is identified. Spectral
efficiency--bit energy tradeoff is analyzed in the low-power and wideband
regimes by employing the effective capacity formulation. In particular, it is
shown that the bit energy increases without bound in the low-power regime as
the average power vanishes. A similar conclusion is reached in the wideband
regime if the number of noninteracting subchannels grow without bound with
increasing bandwidth. On the other hand, it is proven that if the number of
resolvable independent paths and hence the number of noninteracting subchannels
remain bounded as the available bandwidth increases, the bit energy diminishes
to its minimum value in the wideband regime. For this case, expressions for the
minimum bit energy and wideband slope are derived. Overall, energy costs of
channel uncertainty and queueing constraints are identified, and the impact of
multipath richness and sparsity is determined.

The
parent body of this family, Haumea, is one of the largest objects in the Kuiper
belt and is orbited by two satellites. It has been proposed that the Haumea
family was created from dispersed fragments that resulted from a giant impact.
This proposed origin of the Haumea family is however in conflict with the
observed velocity dispersion between the family members (\sim 140 m/s) which is
significantly less than the escape velocity from Haumea's surface (\sim 900
m/s). In this paper we propose a different formation scenario for Haumea's
collisional family. In our scenario the family members are ejected while in
orbit around Haumea. This scenario, therefore, gives naturally rise to a lower
velocity dispersion among the family members than expected from direct ejection
from Haumea's surface. In our scenario Haumea's giant impact forms a single
moon that tidally evolves outward until it suffers a destructive collision from
which the family is created. We show that this formation scenario yields a
velocity dispersion of \sim 190m/s among the family members which is in good
agreement with the observations. The probability for Haumea's initial giant
impact in todays Kuiper belt is less than 10^{-3}. In our scenario, however,
Haumea's giant impact can occur before the excitation of the Kuiper belt and
the ejection of the family members afterwards. This has the advantage that one
can preserve the dynamical coherence of the family and explain Haumea's
original giant impact, which is several orders of magnitude more likely to have
occurred in the primordial dynamically cold Kuiper belt compared to the
dynamically excited Kuiper belt today. Abridged

important role in localizing matter to the 4-dimensional hypersurface

modifications produced in the bulk geometry as well as the consequences on the

For the bulk metric chosen, the Weyl tensor is found to vanish under a certain
condition, thereby satisfying the conditions of a constant curvature bulk.
Consequently we have constructed the solutions to the field equations for such
a bulk and have studied its physical properties. The braneworld is described by
a flat FRW-type metric in the ordinary spatial dimension. It is found that the
the effective cosmological constant for the induced matter is a variable
quantity monitored by the time-dependent warp factor and is associated with the
bending of the braneworlds. The universe is initially decelerated, but
subsequently makes a transition to an accelerated phase at later times, when
its dynamics is dominated by the dynamical dark energy component. For a
particular choice of the warp factor, it has been found that the universe is
represented by a model of dark energy with the age of the universe as the
measure of length, driving the universe to a state of accelerated expansion at

baseline interferometry enables the improvement of Galactic electron density
distribution models, improving distance estimates for the vast majority of
pulsars for which parallax measurements are unavailable. However, pulsars at
southern declinations have been under-represented in previous interferometric
astrometry campaigns. In order to redress this imbalance, we have conducted a
two-year astrometric campaign targeting eight southern pulsars with the
Australian Long Baseline Array. The program summarized in this paper has
resulted in the measurement of seven new pulsar parallaxes, with success on
objects down to a mean flux density of 0.8 mJy at 1600 MHz. Our results
highlight the substantial uncertainties that remain when utilizing free
electron density models for individual pulsar distances. Until this study, PSR
J0630-2834 was believed to convert 16% of its spin-down energy into x-rays, but
our measured parallax distance of 332 (+52 -40) pc has revised this value to
<1%. In contrast, PSR J0108-1431 was found to be almost a factor of two more
distant than previously thought, making its conversion of spin-down energy to
x-rays the most efficient known (>1%). The 8.5 second radio pulsar J2144-3933
was found to be closer than previously predicted, making its apparent 1400 MHz
radio luminosity the lowest of any known pulsar (20 microJy kpc^2). We have
examined the growing population of neutron stars with accurate parallaxes to
determine the effect of distance errors on the underlying neutron star velocity
distribution, and find that typical distance errors may be biasing the
estimated mean pulsar velocity upwards by 5%, and are likely to exaggerate the
distribution's high-velocity tail.

environment of a black hole with angular resolution comparable to the event
horizon. Realizing this goal would open a new window on the study of General
Relativity in the strong field regime, accretion and outflow processes at the
edge of a black hole, the existence of an event horizon, and fundamental black
hole physics (e.g., spin). Steady long-term progress on improving the
capability of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) at short wavelengths has
now made it extremely likely that this goal will be achieved within the next
decade. The most compelling evidence for this is the recent observation by
1.3mm VLBI of Schwarzschild radius scale structure in SgrA*, the compact source
of radio, submm, NIR and xrays at the center of the Milky Way. SgrA* is thought
to mark the position of a ~4 million solar mass black hole, and because of its
proximity and estimated mass presents the largest apparent event horizon size
of any black hole candidate in the Universe. Over the next decade, existing and
planned mm/submm facilities will be combined into a high sensitivity, high
angular resolution ""Event Horizon Telescope"" that will bring us as close to the
edge of black hole as we will come for decades. This white paper describes the
science case for mm/submm VLBI observations of both SgrA* and M87 (a radio loud
AGN of a much more luminous class that SgrA*). We emphasize that while there is
development and procurement involved, the technical path forward is clear, and
the recent successful observations have removed much of the risk that would
normally be associated with such an ambitious project.

neutron flux, energy distribution, and direction of neutron motion for both
fast and thermal neutrons. Many neutron detectors are plagued by large
backgrounds from x-rays and gamma rays, and most current neutron detectors lack
single-event energy sensitivity or any information on neutron directionality.
Even the best detectors are limited by cosmic ray neutron backgrounds. All
applications (neutron scattering and radiography, measurements of solar and
cosmic ray neutron flux, measurements of neutron interaction cross sections,
monitoring of neutrons at nuclear facilities, oil exploration, and searches for
fissile weapons of mass destruction) will benefit from the improved neutron
detection sensitivity and improved measurements of neutron properties made
possible by this detector. The detector is free of backgrounds from x-rays,
gamma rays, beta particles, relativistic singely charged particles and cosmic
ray neutrons. It is sensitive to thermal neutrons, fission neutrons, and high
energy neutrons, with detection features distinctive for each energy range. It
is capable of determining the location of a source of fission neutrons based on
characteristics of elastic scattering of neutrons by helium nuclei. The
detector we have constructed could identify one gram of reactor grade
plutonium, one meter away, with less than one minute of observation time.

Lucid family of intensional programming languages that rely on the higher-order
intensional logic (HOIL) to provide context-oriented multidimensional reasoning
of intensional expressions. HOIL combines functional programming with various
intensional logics to allow explicit context expressions to be evaluated as
first-class values that can be passed as parameters to functions and return as
results with an appropriate set of operators defined on contexts. GIPSY's
frameworks are implemented in Java as a collection of replaceable components
for the compilers of various Lucid dialects and the demand-driven eductive
evaluation engine that can run distributively. GIPSY provides support for
hybrid programming models that couple intensional and imperative languages for
a variety of needs. Explicit context expressions limit the scope of evaluation
of math expressions (effectively a Lucid program is a mathematics or physics
expression constrained by the context) in tensor physics, regular math in
multiple dimensions, etc., and for cyberforensic reasoning as one of the
use-cases of interest. Thus, GIPSY is a support testbed for HOIL-based
languages some of which enable such reasoning, as in formal cyberforensic case
analysis with event reconstruction. In this paper we discuss the GIPSY
architecture, its evaluation engine and example use-cases.

expectations for a double bond photoisomerization model: 1) it describes
favorable twisting in the excited state and 2) it describes conical
intersections which can mediate radidationless decay. We examine the topology,
topography and extent of the conical intersection seams. Important properties
of the model include 1) two regimes of the coupling ratio where the first
excited state intersects the ground and a higher excited state along orthogonal
twisting coordinates or along the same coordinate 2) first and higher excited
state intersections occurring in regions of little or no twisting and 3) charge
localization connected with excited-state twisting which changes
discontinuously across a conical intersection. The model is promising as a
simple extension of empirical force fields in order to describe
photoisomerization processes in methine-bridged systems and as a starting point
for more elaborate models which may include antisymmetric internal couplings or
which may be interfaced with environmental or quantum dynamical models.

unknown. Here, we demonstrated that FADD protein was expressed in both
cytoplasmic and nuclear compartment in ex vivo thyroid cells demonstrating that
nuclear sublocalization of FADD protein was a relevant phenomenon occurring in

FADD localized mainly on euchromatin. We confirmed the nuclear localization of
FADD in ex vivo liver and showed that in this organ FADD and MBD4 interact
together. These results demonstrate that FADD is physiologically expressed in
the nucleus of cells in at least two mouse organs. This particular localization
opens new possible role of FADD in vivo either asan inhibitor of cell death, or
as a transcription factor, or as a molecular link between apoptosis and genome

It is found that the temporal quark correlation function in the deconfined

the spectral function. This indicates that excitation modes of the quark field
have small decay rates. The bare quark mass and momentum dependence of the
spectral function is analyzed with this ansatz. In the chiral limit we find
that the quark spectral function has two collective modes corresponding to the
normal and plasmino excitations in the high temperature limit. Over a rather
wide temperature range in the deconfined phase the pole mass of these modes at
zero momentum, which corresponds to the thermal mass of the quark, is
approximately proportional to temperature. With increasing bare quark masses
the plasmino mode gradually disappears and the spectral function is dominated
by a single pole. We also discuss quasi-particle properties of heavy quarks in
the deconfined phase. In the confined phase, it is found that the pole ansatz

this article we apply this technique to the strong approximation bivariate

that the error in the approximation of the uniform bivariate $n$-empirical

(n))^{3/2}$. Previously, from the 1975 article of Komlos, Major and Tusn\'ady,
the global error bound was of order $n^{-1/2}(log (n))^{2}$, and from our 1998
article, the local error bounds were of order $n^{-1/2}(log (nab))^{2}$ or
$n^{-1/2}(log (na))^{2}$. We think that, in the d-variate case, the global
error bound between the uniform d-variate $n$-empirical process and the
associated Gaussian process is of order $n^{-1/2}(log (n))^{(d+1)/2}$, and that
this result is optimal. The new feature of this article is to identify
martingales in the error terms and to apply to them an exponential inequality.
The idea is to bound of the compensator of the error term, instead of bounding

of a neutral absorber. The parameters of the ionized absorber are not

for the ~1 keV depression visible in the pn dipping spectra, and naturally
explains it as a blend of lines and edges unresolved by pn. A deeper

spanning a month. During this time we observed four ordinary outbursts lasting
about 2-3 days and reaching an amplitude of ~1.7 mag. On all nights our light
curve revealed persistent modulation with the stable period of 0.081088(3)
days. These humps were already observed on one night by Tramposch et al.
(2005), who additionally observed superhumps during a superoutburst.
Remarkably, from scant evidence at their disposal they were able to discern
them as negative and positive (common) superhumps, respectively. Our period in
quiescence clearly different from their superhump period confirmed this. Our
discovery of an additional modulation, attributed by us to the orbital wave,
completes the overall picture. Lack of superhumps in our data indicates that
all eruptions we observed were ordinary outbursts. The earlier observation of
the superhumps combined with the presence of the ordinary outbursts in our data
enables classification of SDSS J2100 as an active SU UMa dwarf nova.
Additionally, we have promoted SDSS J2100 to the group of cataclysmic variables
exhibiting three periodic modulations of light from their accretion discs. We
updated available information on positive and negative superhumps and thus
provided enhanced evidence that their properties are strongly correlated
mutually as well as with the orbital period. By recourse to these relations we
were able to remove an alias ambiguity and to identify the orbital period of
SDSS J2100 of 0.083304(6) days. SDSS J21000 is only third SU UMa dwarf nova
showing both positive and negative superhumps. Their respective period excess

scheduler improves task utilisation (Execution time / deadline) and also
increases the number of tasks that are being scheduled. Laxity is a measure of
the spare time permitted for the task before it misses its deadline, and is
computed using the expression (deadline - (current time + execution time)).
Weight decides the priority of the task and is defined by the expression
(quantum slice time / allocated time)*total core time for the task. Quantum
slice time is the time actually used, allocated time is the time allocated by
the scheduler, and total core time is the time actually reserved by the core
for execution of one quantum of the task. Non-uniform laxity enables scheduling
of tasks that have higher priority before the normal execution of other tasks
and is computed by multiplying the weight of the task with its laxity. The
algorithm presented in the paper has been simulated on Cheddar, a real time
scheduling tool and also on SESC, an architectural simulator for multicore
platforms, for upto 5000 random task sets, and upto 5000 cores. This scheduler
improves task utilisation by 35% and the number of tasks being scheduled by

parabolic flight campaigns to date, operating for a total of 2.4 hours in
reduced gravity conditions and successfully recording over 300 separate

particle velocities achieved range from 0.03-0.28 m s^-1 and a high-speed,
high-resolution camera captures the events at 107 frames per second from two
viewing angles separated by either 48.8 or 60.0 degrees. The particles can be
stored inside the experiment vacuum chamber at temperatures of 80-300 K for
several uninterrupted hours using a built-in thermal accumulation system. The
copper structure allows cooling down to cryogenic temperatures before
commencement of the experiments. Throughout the parabolic flight campaigns,
add-ons and modifications have been made, illustrating the instrument

algorithm to suppress aliasing effects and a Krylov-space inversion method to
enable high performance with high resolution. These techniques are implemented
in the ARGO computer code. We reconstruct the field over a 500 Mpc cube with
Mpc grid-resolution while accounting both for the angular and radial selection
functions of the SDSS, and the shot noise giving an effective resolution of the
order of ~10 Mpc. In addition, we correct for the redshift distortions in the
linear and nonlinear regimes in an approximate way. We show that the commonly
used method of inverse weighting the galaxies by the corresponding selection
function heads to excess noise in regions where the density of the observed
galaxies is small. It is more accurate and conservative to adopt a Bayesian
framework in which we model the galaxy selection/detection process to be
Poisson-binomial. This results in heavier smoothing in regions of reduced
sampling density. Our results show a complex cosmic web structure with huge
void regions indicating that the recovered matter distribution is highly
non-Gaussian. Filamentary structures are clearly visible on scales up to ~20
Mpc. We also calculate the statistical distribution of density after smoothing
the reconstruction with Gaussian kernels of different radii r_S and find good
agreement with a log-normal distribution for ~10 Mpc < r_S < ~30 Mpc.

quality and volume of the observations, and we have accordingly selected a list
of 17 primary and 47 secondary calibrators. We have developed an approach to a
robust global fit for the angular diameters using the whole volume of
quality-controlled data, largely independent of a priori assumptions. Our
results have been compared with direct measurements, and indirect estimates
based on spectrophotometric methods, and general agreement is found within the
combined uncertainties. The stars in our list cover the range K=-2.9 to +3.0
mag in brightness, and 1.3 to 20.5 milliarcseconds in uniform-disk diameter.
The relative accuracy of the angular diameter values is on average 0.4% and 2%
for the primary and secondary calibrators respectively. Our calibrators are
well suited for interferometric observations in the near-infrared on baselines
between ~20m and ~200m, and their accuracy is superior, at least for the
primary calibrators, to other similar catalogues. Therefore, the present list
of calibrators has the potential to lead to significantly improved
interferometric scientific results.

with physical strange quark mass and almost physical light quark masses using
lattices with temporal extent $N_{\tau}=8$. Calculations have been performed
with two different improved staggered fermion actions, the asqtad and p4
actions. Overall, we find good agreement between results obtained with these
two $O(a^2)$ improved staggered fermion discretization schemes. A comparison
with earlier calculations on coarser lattices is performed to quantify
systematic errors in current studies of the equation of state. We also present
results for observables that are sensitive to deconfining and chiral aspects of
the QCD transition on $N_\tau=6$ and 8 lattices. We find that deconfinement and
chiral symmetry restoration happen in the same narrow temperature interval.

be achieved by returning information about only one beamforming matrix (BFM)
for all subcarriers from each MT, compared to one BFM for each subcarrier in
the conventional schemes. However, since the previously proposed channel
decomposition was derived based on singular value decomposition, the resulting
system performance is impaired by the subchannels associated with the smallest
singular values. To circumvent this obstacle, this work proposes improved
opportunistic scheduling and beamforming schemes based on geometric mean
decomposition-based channel decomposition. In addition to the inherent
advantage in reduced feedback, the proposed schemes can achieve improved system
performance by decomposing the MIMO channels into spatial subchannels with more
evenly distributed channel gains. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness
of the proposed opportunistic scheduling and beamforming schemes.

Hercules is embedded in a larger stream of stars. A clear stellar extension is
seen to the Northwest with several additional candidate stellar overdensities

sample of galaxy clusters directly obtained from the simulation without

of the cluster halos, and classified them into three categories depending on
the merger events they have undergone: major mergers, minor mergers, and
relaxed clusters. The main properties of each one of these classes and the
differences among them are discussed. The collisions among galaxy clusters are
produced naturally by the non-linear evolution in the simulated cosmological

to discuss the role of merger events as a source of feedback and reheating, and
their effects on the existence of cool cores in galaxy clusters, as well as in
the scaling relations.

the presence of stochastic perturbations. In many planet-forming disks, the
Type I migration mechanism, driven by asymmetric torques, acts on a short time
scale and compromises planet formation. If the disk also supports MHD
instabilities, however, the corresponding turbulent fluctuations produce
additional stochastic torques that modify the steady inward migration scenario.
This work studies the migration of planetary cores in the presence of
stochastic fluctuations using complementary methods, including a Fokker-Planck
approach and iterative maps. Stochastic torques have two main effects: [1]
Through outward diffusion, a small fraction of the planetary cores can survive
in the face of Type I inward migration. [2] For a given starting condition, the
result of any particular realization of migration is uncertain, so that results
must be described in terms of the distributions of outcomes. In addition to
exploring different regimes of parameter space, this paper considers the
effects of the outer disk boundary condition, varying initial conditions, and
time-dependence of the torque parameters. For disks with finite radii, the
fraction of surviving planets decreases exponentially with time. We find the
survival fractions and decay rates for a range of disk models, and find the
expected distribution of locations for surviving planets. For expected disk
properties, the survival fraction lies in the range $0.01 < p_S < 0.1$.

changes only by a maximum of 2% at $M=10^{14}$ M$_\odot$ whereas the

with a unique opportunity to observe strong-field GR effects. Recent millimeter
very long baseline interferometric observations of Sgr A* have demonstrated the

combine the angular resolution necessary to identify the overall morphology of

black hole in Sgr A*, either by detecting the periodic signature of hot spots
at the innermost stable circular orbit or parameter estimation in models of the
quiescent emission. Longer term, a (sub)millimeter VLBI ""Event Horizon
