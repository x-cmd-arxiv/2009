ground states within the space of nearest neighbor valence bond states on the

non-valence bond ground states, as well as a ""resonating-valence-bond""
Hamiltonian whose unique ground states within the nearest neighbor valence bond
space are four topologically degenerate ""Sutherland-Rokhsar-Kivelson'' (SRK)

liquid. The proof of this uniqueness is intimately related to the linear
independence of the nearest neighbor valence bond states on quite general and
arbitrarily large kagome lattices, which is also established in this work. It
is argued that the SRK ground states are also unique within the entire Hilbert

the strategies developed in this work to other lattice types are also
discussed.

the existence of different Cartan forms and Legendre transformations. We
propose a differential-geometric setting for the dynamics of a higher-order
field theory, based on the Skinner and Rusk formalism for mechanics. This
approach incorporates aspects of both, the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian
description, since the field equations are formulated using the Lagrangian on a
higher-order jet bundle and the canonical multisymplectic form on its dual. As
both of these objects are uniquely defined, the Skinner-Rusk approach has the
advantage that it does not suffer from the arbitrariness in conventional
descriptions. The result is that we obtain a unique and global intrinsic
version of the Euler-Lagrange equations for higher-order field theories.
Several examples illustrate our construction.

Capturing (FC, Khokhlov (1995)) for tracking thin unresolved physical flames in

  We observe numerical noises generated by original realization of the
technique. Alternative artificial burning rates are discussed, which produce
acceptably quiet flames. Two new quiet models are calibrated to yield required
""flame"" speed and width, and further studied in 2D and 3D setting.
Landau-Darrieus type instabilities of the flames are observed. One model also
shows significantly anisotropic propagation speed on the grid, both effects
increasingly pronounced at larger matter expansion as a result of burning; this
makes the model unacceptable for use in type Ia supernova simulations. Another
model looks promising for use in flame capturing at fuel to ash density ratio
of order 3 and below. That ""Model B"" yields flames completely localized within
a region 6 cells wide at any expansion.
  We study Markstein effect for flame models described, through direct
numerical simulations and through quasi-steady technique developed. Comparison
demonstrates that Markstein effect dominates instability effects on curved
flame speed for Model B in 2D simulations for fuel to ash density ratio of
about 2.5 and below. We find critical wavelength of LD instability by direct
simulations of perturbed nearly planar flames; these agree with analytical
estimates when Markstein number values found in this work are used. We conclude
that the behavior of model B is well understood, and optimal for FC

microelectrode arrays to demonstrate that cortical networks which generate
neuronal avalanches benefit from maximized dynamic range, i.e. the ability to
respond to the greatest range of stimuli. By changing the ratio of excitation
and inhibition in the cultures, we derive a network tuning curve for stimulus
processing as a function of distance from the critical state in agreement with
predictions from our simulations. Our findings suggest that in the cortex, (1)
balanced excitation and inhibition establishes the critical state, which
maximizes the range of inputs that can be processed and (2) spontaneous
activity and input processing are unified in the context of critical phenomena.

based on the Born approximation fail in this kind of configuration because of
multiply scattered echoes and aberration distortions. The experimental set up
we consider uses an array of programmable transmitters/receivers. A target is
placed behind a scattering medium. The impulse responses between all array
elements are measured and form a matrix. The core of the method is to separate
the single-scattered echo of the target from the multiple scattering
background. This is possible because of a deterministic coherence along the
antidiagonals of the array response matrix, which is typical of single
scattering. Once this operation is performed, target detection is achieved by
applying the DORT method (French acronym for decomposition of the time reversal
operator). Experimental results are presented in the case of wide-band
ultrasonic waves around 3 MHz. A 125-element array is placed in front of a
collection of randomly distributed steel rods (diameter 0.8mm). The slab
thickness is three times the scattering mean free path. The target is a larger
steel cylinder (diameter 15 mm) that we try to detect and localize. The quality
of detection is assessed theoretically based on random matrix theory and is
shown to be significantly better than what is obtained with classical imaging
methods. Aside from multiple scattering, the technique is also shown to reduce
the aberrations induced by an heterogeneous layer.

various mass-loss mechanisms of luminous stars in the upper H-R diagram. Very
recent 3-D RT calculations, combined with hydrodynamic simulations, show that
radiatively-driven winds of OB supergiants are structured due to large-scale
density- and velocity-fields caused by rotating bright spots. The mass-loss
rates computed from matching DACs in HD 64760 (B Ib) do not reveal appreciable
changes from the rates of smooth wind models. Intermediate yellow supergiants
(such as Rho Cas, F-G Ia0), on the other hand, show prominent spectroscopic
signatures of strongly increased mass-loss rates during episodic outbursts.
Long-term spectroscopic monitoring of hypergiants near the Yellow Evolutionary
Void reveals that their mass-loss rates and wind-structure are dominated by
photospheric eruptions and large-amplitude pulsations that impart mechanical
momentum to the circumstellar environment by propagating shock waves. In
massive red supergiants, however, clear evidence for mechanical wave
propagation from the sub-photospheric convection zones is lacking. Recent
spatially resolved HST-STIS observations inside Betelgeuse's (M Iab) very
extended chromosphere and dust envelope show evidence of warm chromospheric gas
far beyond the dust condensation radius of RT models. Models for these
long-term spectroscopic observations demonstrate that the chromospheric
pulsations are not spherically symmetric. The STIS observations point to the
importance of mechanical wave propagation for heating and sustaining
chromospheric conditions in the extended winds of red supergiants.

masses that are higher than the 13 MJ planetary mass limit are ruled out by
past radial velocity measurements unless the system radial velocity is more
than twice the current upper limits and the near-periastron orbital phase was
never observed. This new planetary system is remarkable, in part, because its
star, VB 10, is near the lower mass limit for a star. Our astrometric
observations provide a dynamical mass measurement and will in time allow us to
confront the theoretical models of formation and evolution of such systems and
their members. We thus add to the diversity of planetary systems and to the
small number of known M-dwarf planets. Planets such as VB 10b could be the most
numerous type of planets because M stars comprise >70% of all stars. To date
they have remained hidden since the dominant radial-velocity (RV)

The periodic beat patterns are the result of a mechanical feedback that leads
to self-organized bending waves along the axoneme. Using a theoretical

velocities, velocity and flux variability of the knots. Radial velocities and
physical parameters of the gas were derived from spectroscopy. Finally, spatial
velocities and inclination of the flows were obtained by combining both imaging
and spectroscopy. The P.M. analysis reveals three distinct, partially
overlapping outflows. In 20 years, about 60% of the knots show some degree of
flux variability. Our set of observations apparently indicates acceleration and
deceleration in a variety of knots along the jets. For about 20% of the knots,
mostly coincident with working surfaces or interacting knots along the flows, a
relevant variability in both flux and velocity is observed. We argue that both
variabilities are related and that all or part of the kinetic energy lost by
the interacting knots is successively radiated. The analysis indicates the
presence of very light, ionised, and hot flows, impacting a denser medium.
Several knots are deflected. At least for a couple of them (HH54 G and G0), the
deflection originates from the collision of the two. For the more massive parts
of the flow, the deflection is likely the result of the flow collision with a
dense cloud or with clumps.

insights from the sustainability of human civilization on Earth, we propose
that faster-growth may not be sustainable on the galactic scale. If this is the

explicit and usually cumbersome expression of Dirac observables in terms of
gauge non invariant quantities is irrelevant if their Poisson algebra is
sufficiently simple. Precisely that can be achieved by employing the relational
formalism and a specific type of matter proposed originally by Brown and
Kucha{\v r}, namely pressureless dust fields. Moreover one is able to derive a
compact expression for a physical Hamiltonian that drives their physical time
evolution. The resulting gauge invariant Hamiltonian system is obtained by
Higgs -- ing the dust scalar fields and has an infinite number of conserved
charges which force the Goldstone bosons to decouple from the evolution. In
previous publications we have shown that explicitly for cosmological
perturbations. In this article we analyse the spherically symmetric sector of
the theory and it turns out that the solutions are in one--to--one

probe beam tuned to the $S\to P$ transition was obtained by creation of quantum
superpositions of magnetic sublevels (Zeeman coherences) in the rubidium ground
state ($\Lambda$ scheme). Additionally, electromagnetically induced
transparency was accomplished in a ladder scheme by acting with an additional
strong coupling laser on the $P\to D$ transition. Under conditions of a
two-photon resonance the rotation was significantly reduced, which is
interpreted as a competition between the two processes. The effect was observed
in sub-Gauss magnetic fields and could be used for efficient coherent control
of generation of the ground-state coherences, e.g. for controlling the

field, including simplified radiative transfer. The two clusters have T_X~3 and
6 keV, respectively, and, at z~0, both host a prominent, central cD galaxy.
  Comparing the simulations without and with baryons, it is found for the
latter that the inner DM density profiles, r<50-100 kpc, steepen considerably:
Delta(alpha)~0.5-0.6, where -alpha is the logarithmic DM density gradient. This
is mainly due to the central stellar cDs becoming very massive, as a
consequence of the onset of late time cooling flows and related star formation.
Once these spurious cooling flows have been corrected for, and the cluster
gravitational potentials dynamically adjusted, much smaller pinching effects
are found: Delta(alpha)~0.1. Including the effects of baryonic pinching,
central slopes of alpha~1.0 and 1.2 are found for the DM in the two clusters,
interestingly close to recent observational findings.
  For the simulations with baryons, the inner density profile of DM+ICM gas
combined is found to be only very marginally steeper than that of the DM,
Delta(alpha)<0.05. However, the total matter inner density profiles are found
to be Delta(alpha)~0.5 steeper than the inner profiles in the dark matter only
simulations.

structures of very young stars orbiting the central super-massive black hole
within a distance of a few 0.1 pc. A number of analyses have been carried out
to investigate the dynamical behaviour and consequences of these discs,
including disc thickness and eccentricity growth as well as mutual interaction
and warping. However, most of these studies have neglected the influence of the
stellar cusp surrounding the black hole, which is believed to be 1-2 orders of
magnitude more massive than the disc(s).
  By means of N-body integrations using our bhint code, we study the impact of
stellar cusps of different compositions. We find that although the presence of
a cusp does have an important effect on the evolution of an otherwise isolated
flat disc, its influence on the evolution of disc thickness and warping is
rather mild in a two-disc configuration. However, we show that the creation of
highly eccentric orbits strongly depends on the graininess of the cusp (i.e.
the mean and maximum stellar masses): While Chang (2009) recently found that
full cycles of Kozai resonance are prevented by the presence of an analytic
cusp, we show that relaxation processes play an important role in such highly
dense regions and support short-term resonances. We thus find that young disc
stars on initially circular orbits can achieve high eccentricities by resonant
effects also in the presence of a cusp of stellar remnants, yielding a
mechanism to create S-stars and hyper-velocity stars.
  Furthermore, we discuss the underlying initial mass function (IMF) of the
young stellar discs and find no definite evidence for a non-canonical IMF.

spectroscopy with the Chandra X-ray observatory, allowing the SMBH mass (Mbh)
to be inferred directly under the hydrostatic approximation. This technique
does not require calibration against other SMBH measurement methods and its
accuracy depends only on the ISM being close to hydrostatic, which is supported
by the smooth X-ray isophotes of the galaxies. Combined with results from our
recent study of the elliptical galaxy NGC4649, this brings to four the number
of galaxies with SMBHs measured in this way. Of these, three already have mass
determinations from the kinematics of either the stars or a central gas disc,
and hence join only a handful of galaxies with Mbh measured by more than one
technique. We find good agreement between the different methods, providing
support for the assumptions implicit in both the hydrostatic and the dynamical
models. The stellar mass-to-light ratios for each galaxy inferred by our
technique are in agreement with the predictions of stellar population synthesis
models assuming a Kroupa initial mass function (IMF). This concurrence implies
that no more than ~10-20% of the ISM pressure is nonthermal, unless there is a
conspiracy between the shape of the IMF and nonthermal pressure. Finally, we
compute Bondi accretion rates, finding that the two galaxies with the highest
rates exhibit little evidence of X-ray cavities, suggesting that the
correlation with the AGN jet power takes time to be established.

deliver a wealth of molecular line observations of young stellar objects
(YSOs). Based on line fluxes, chemical abundances can then be estimated by
radiative transfer calculations. To derive physical properties from abundances,
the chemical network needs to be modeled and fitted to the observations. This
modeling process is however computationally exceedingly demanding, particularly
if in addition to density and temperature, far UV (FUV) irradiation, X-rays,
and multi-dimensional geometry have to be considered.
  We develop a fast tool, suitable for various applications of chemical
modeling in YSOs. A grid of the chemical composition of the gas having a
density, temperature, FUV irradiation and X-ray flux is pre-calculated as a
function of time. A specific interpolation approach is developed to reduce the
database to a feasible size. Published models of AFGL 2591 are used to verify
the accuracy of the method. A second benchmark test is carried out for FUV
sensitive molecules. The novel method for chemical modeling is more than
250,000 times faster than direct modeling and agrees within a mean factor of
1.35. The tool is distributed for public use.
  In the course of devloping the method, the chemical evolution is explored: We
find that X-ray chemistry in envelopes of YSOs can be reproduced by means of an
enhanced cosmic-ray ionization rate. We further find that the abundance of CH+
in low-density gas with high ionization can be enhanced by the recombination of
doubly ionized carbon (C++) and suggest a new value for the initial abundance
of the main sulphur carrier in the hot-core.

to translate the halo velocity function into a galaxy velocity function, we
compare the simulation results with a sample of galaxies from the early catalog
release of ALFALFA. We find that our simulations are able to reproduce the
velocity function in the 80-300 km/s velocity range, having a value ~10 times
larger than the universal velocity function in the Virgo-direction region. In
the low velocity regime, 35-80 km/s, the warm dark matter simulation reproduces
the observed flattening of the velocity function. On the contrary, the
simulation with cold dark matter predicts a steep rise in the velocity function
towards lower velocities; for V_max=35 km/s, it forecasts ~10 times more
sources than the ones observed. If confirmed by the complete ALFALFA survey,
our results indicate a potential problem for the cold dark matter paradigm or

abundance of CO+, a molecule known to be enhanced by far UV (FUV) and X-ray

volume of gas irradiated by protostellar FUV radiation is very small due to the
high extinction by dust. The abundance of CO+ is thus underpredicted by orders
of magnitude. In a more realistic model, FUV photons can escape through an
outflow region and irradiate gas at the border to the envelope. Thus, we
introduce the first 2D axi-symmetric chemical model of the envelope of a
high-mass star forming region to explain the CO+ observations as a prototypical
FUV tracer. The model assumes an axi-symmetric power-law density structure with
a cavity due to the outflow. The local FUV flux is calculated by a Monte Carlo
radiative transfer code taking scattering on dust into account. A grid of
precalculated chemical abundances, introduced in the first part of this series

allows to calculate the temperature structure of the FUV heated outflow walls
self-consistently with the chemistry.
  Synthetic maps of the line flux are calculated using a raytracer code.
Single-dish and interferometric observations are simulated and the model
results are compared to published and new JCMT and SMA observations. The
two-dimensional model of AFGL 2591 is able to reproduce the JCMT single-dish

flow on spheres and projective spaces, our solutions are counter-examples to
some folklore conjectures on ancient solutions of Ricci flow on compact

system-bath coupling. I identify a transition from coherent to incoherent
dynamics with increasing temperature, due to multi-phonon effects not captured
by a standard weak-coupling treatment. The crossover temperature has a marked
dependence on the degree of spatial correlation between fluctuations
experienced at the two system sites. For strong correlations, this leads to the
possibility of coherence surviving into a high temperature regime.

Sensing with partially known support, as introduced by Vaswani and Lu. The
problem is to recover a signal $x \in \mathbb R^p$ using an observation vector
$y=Ax$, where $A \in \mathbb R^{n\times p}$ and in the highly underdetermined
setting $n\ll p$. Based on an initial and possibly erroneous guess $T$ of the
signal's support ${\rm supp}(x)$, the Modified Basis Pursuit method of Vaswani
and Lu consists of minimizing the $\ell_1$ norm of the estimate over the
indices indexed by $T^c$ only. We prove exact recovery essentially under a
Restricted Isometry Property assumption of order 2 times the cardinal of $T^c
\cap {\rm supp}(x)$, i.e. the number of missed components.

generating a mu term consistent with the requirements of electro-weak symmetry

as a protuberance on a fictitious waveguide, which acts as trajectory. The
model is based on de Broglie's original electron wave-particle relativistic
theory, and on the observation that the Klein-Gordon equation governs the
propagation mode of a common microwave waveguide - with the Schroedinger
equation as a low group velocity approximation. This analogy opened for
practical physical models, including solitons. In the linear case a conceived
corpuscle zigzags within the fictitious waveguide - a zigzagging that resembles
Penrose's picture of Dirac's electron theory. The soliton envelope is defined
by a special nonlinear version of the Schroedinger equation. The nonlinearity
cancels the de Broglie/Bohm Quantum Potential of the envelope. The wavefunction
is confined by the envelope, and thus the concept of the collapse of the
wavefunction is eliminated. Since the electron model is based directly on the
Special theory of relativity it also illustrates that theory. The corpuscle,
incorporating spin and charge, which moves at the speed of light, needs further
study relating it to the photon. A model of the photon based on the mutual
coupling of two modes of an optical fiber at the Planck scale, is suggested.
One of these modes is thought to carry two orthogonal polarized electromagnetic
external fields, while the other, internal, mode carries a corpuscle that moves
helically and thus represents the spin. A single electron is considered to have
one polarization only, without any superposition possibility; hence, the
concept of collapse in a polarization measurement is eliminated.

naturally different from that of light fermions. In this paper, we show that it

of low-mass stars from clusters. Here we combine the results from dynamical
simulations of star clusters in tidal fields with our evolutionary synthesis
code GALEV to extend the models by a new dimension: the total cluster
disruption time. We reanalyse the mass function evolution found in N-body
simulations of star clusters in tidal fields, parametrise it as a function of
age and total cluster disruption time and use this parametrisation to compute
GALEV models as a function of age, metallicity and the total cluster disruption
time. We study the impact of cluster dissolution on the colour (generally, they
become redder) and magnitude (they become fainter) evolution of star clusters,
their mass-to-light ratios (off by a factor of ~2 -- 4 from standard
predictions), and quantify the effect on the cluster age determination from
integrated photometry (in most cases, clusters appear to be older than they
are, between 20 and 200%). By comparing our model results with observed M/L
ratios for old compact objects in the mass range 10^4.5 -- 10^8 Msun, we find a
strong discrepancy for objects more massive than 10^7 Msun (higher M/L). This

understanding of complex systems. One of the most relevant features of graphs
representing real systems is community structure, or clustering, i. e. the
organization of vertices in clusters, with many edges joining vertices of the
same cluster and comparatively few edges joining vertices of different
clusters. Such clusters, or communities, can be considered as fairly
independent compartments of a graph, playing a similar role like, e. g., the
tissues or the organs in the human body. Detecting communities is of great
importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines where
systems are often represented as graphs. This problem is very hard and not yet
satisfactorily solved, despite the huge effort of a large interdisciplinary
community of scientists working on it over the past few years. We will attempt
a thorough exposition of the topic, from the definition of the main elements of
the problem, to the presentation of most methods developed, with a special
focus on techniques designed by statistical physicists, from the discussion of
crucial issues like the significance of clustering and how methods should be
tested and compared against each other, to the description of applications to
real networks.

material into the Galactic halo. As the material cools, it condenses into
clouds. By using FLASH three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we
model and study the dynamical evolution of these gas clouds after they form and
begin to fall toward the Galactic plane. In our simulations, we assume that the
gas clouds form at a height of z=5 kpc above the Galactic midplane, then begin
to fall from rest. We investigate how the cloud's evolution, dynamics, and
interaction with the interstellar medium (ISM) are affected by the initial mass
of the cloud. We find that clouds with sufficiently large initial densities (>
0.1 hydrogen atoms per cc) accelerate sufficiently and maintain sufficiently
large column densities as to be observed and identified as high-velocity clouds
(HVCs) even if the ISM is weakly magnetized (1.3 micro Gauss). We also
investigate the effects of various possible magnetic field configurations. As
expected, the ISM's resistance is greatest when the magnetic field is strong
and perpendicular to the motion of the cloud. The trajectory of the cloud is
guided by the magnetic field lines in cases where the magnetic field is
oriented diagonal to the Galactic plane. The model cloud simulations show that
the interactions between the cloud and the ISM can be understood via analogy to
the shock tube problem which involves shock and rarefaction waves. We also
discuss accelerated ambient gas, streamers of material ablated from the clouds,
and the cloud's evolution from a sphere-shaped to a disk- or cigar-shaped
object.

rectangular piston associated with a massless fractional Klein-Gordon field at
finite temperature. Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed on the walls of a
$d$-dimensional rectangular cavity, and a fractional Neumann condition is
imposed on the piston that moves freely inside the cavity. The fractional
Neumann condition gives an interpolation between the Dirichlet and Neumann
conditions, where the Casimir force is known to be always attractive and always
repulsive respectively. For the fractional Neumann boundary condition, the
attractive or repulsive nature of the Casimir force is governed by the
fractional order which takes values from zero (Dirichlet) to one (Neumann).
When the fractional order is larger than 1/2, the Casimir force is always
repulsive. For some fractional orders that are less than but close to 1/2, it
is shown that the Casimir force can be either attractive or repulsive depending
on the aspect ratio of the cavity and the temperature.

motivated, mainly by the assumption of hidden scalar field and some associated

It considers a
group of related concepts derived from condensed matter and statistical
physics. The key technical ideas here go under the names of ""singularity"",
""order parameter"", ""mean field theory"", and ""variational method"".
  In a less technical vein, the question here is how can matter, ordinary
matter, support a diversity of forms. We see this diversity each time we
observe ice in contact with liquid water or see water vapor, ""steam"", come up
from a pot of heated water. Different phases can be qualitatively different in
that walking on ice is well within human capacity, but walking on liquid water
is proverbially forbidden to ordinary humans. These differences have been
apparent to humankind for millennia, but only brought within the domain of
scientific understanding since the 1880s.
  A phase transition is a change from one behavior to another. A first order
phase transition involves a discontinuous jump in a some statistical variable
of the system. The discontinuous property is called the order parameter. Each
phase transitions has its own order parameter that range over a tremendous
variety of physical properties. These properties include the density of a
liquid gas transition, the magnetization in a ferromagnet, the size of a
connected cluster in a percolation transition, and a condensate wave function
in a superfluid or superconductor. A continuous transition occurs when that
jump approaches zero. This note is about statistical mechanics and the
development of mean field theory as a basis for a partial understanding of this
phenomenon.

approaches to unveil the reionization history of the Universe using HI 21-cm

properties of the reionization HI 21-cm. We develop the formalism to calculate
the Multi-frequency Angular Power Spectrum (MAPS) and quantify the statistics
of the HI signal as a joint function of the angular multipole l and frequency
separation \Delta\nu. We adopt a simple model for the HI distribution which
incorporates patchy reionization and use it to study the signatures of ionized

A major part of the thesis investigates the possibility of detecting ionized
bubbles around individual sources in 21-cm maps. We present a visibility based
matched filter technique to optimally combine the signal from an ionized bubble
and minimize the noise and foreground contributions. The formalism makes
definite predictions on the ability to detect an ionized bubble or conclusively
rule out its presence within a radio map. Results are presented for the GMRT
and the MWA. Using simulated HI maps we analyzed the impact of HI fluctuations
outside the bubble on its detectability. Various other issues such as (i)

$\xi$ to the Ricci scalar in a $D$ dimensional FLRW spacetime with a constant
deceleration parameter $q=\epsilon-1$, $\epsilon=-{\dot{H}}/{H^2}$. Correlation
functions for the Bunch-Davies vacuum of such a theory have long been known to
be infrared divergent for a wide range of values of $\epsilon$. We resolve
these divergences by explicitly matching the spacetime under consideration to a
spacetime without infrared divergencies. Such a procedure ensures that all
correlation functions with respect to the vacuum in the spacetime of interest
are infrared finite. In this newly defined vacuum we construct the coincidence
limit of the propagator and as an example calculate the expectation value of
the stress energy tensor. We find that this approach gives both in the
ultraviolet and in the infrared satisfactory results. Moreover, we find that,
unless the effective mass due to the coupling to the Ricci scalar $\xi R$ is
negative, quantum contributions to the energy density always dilute away
faster, or just as fast, as the background energy density. Therefore, quantum
backreaction is insignificant at the one loop order, unless $\xi R$ is
negative. Finally we compare this approach with known results where the
infrared is regulated by placing the Universe in a finite box. In an
accelerating universe, the results are qualitatively the same, provided one
identifies the size of the Universe with the physical Hubble radius at the time
of the matching. In a decelerating universe however, the two schemes give
different late time behavior for the quantum stress energy tensor. This happens
because in this case the length scale at which one regulates the infrared
becomes sub-Hubble at late times.

the galaxy in an unambiguous way. In regions outside a spherical system, we
design a spherically symmetric spacetime to accommodate the peculiarities just
mentioned. Gravitation emerges in excess of what the observable matter can
produce. We attribute the excess gravitation to a hypothetical, dark, perfect

its density and pressure. The dark density turns out to be proportional to the
square root of the mass of the galaxy and to fall off as $r^{-(2+\alpha)},

the configuration, we require the continuity of the total force field at the

departures from Lorentz invariance can be described. In particular, we focus on
the framework of Effective Field Theory, describing several possible ways of
including Lorentz violation therein and discussing their theoretical viability.
We review the main low energy effects that are expected in this framework. We
discuss the current observational constraints on such a framework, focusing on
those achievable through high-energy astrophysics observations. In this context
we present a summary of the most recent and strongest constraints on QED with
Lorentz violating non-renormalizable operators. Finally, we discuss the present

specific and is presumed to arise from highly specific developmental
mechanisms. However, there are general shared features of connectivity in
systems as different as the networks formed by individual neurons in
Caenorhabditis elegans or in rat visual cortex and the mesoscopic circuitry of
cortical areas in the mouse, macaque, and human brain. In all these systems,
connection length distributions have very similar shapes, with an initial large
peak and a long flat tail representing the admixture of long-distance
connections to mostly short-distance connections. Furthermore, not all
potentially possible synapses are formed, and only a fraction of axons (called
filling fraction) establish synapses with spatially neighboring neurons. We
explored what aspects of these connectivity patterns can be explained simply by
random axonal outgrowth. We found that random axonal growth away from the soma
can already reproduce the known distance distribution of connections. We also
observed that experimentally observed filling fractions can be generated by
competition for available space at the target neurons--a model markedly
different from previous explanations. These findings may serve as a baseline
model for the development of connectivity that can be further refined by more
specific mechanisms.

always predict a too large electronic $k_{z}$-dispersion insufficient to
describe the c-axis response in the real materials. With a more realistic
computation of the electronic band structure the frequency and wavevector

determined and used for adiabatic and nonadiabatic phonon calculations. Our
analysis for Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$ reveals important differences from the lattice
dynamics of $p$- and $n$-doped cuprates. Consistent with experimental evidence
from inelastic neutron scattering the anomalous doping related softening of the
strongly coupling high-frequency oxygen bond-stretching modes (OBSM) which is
generic for the cuprate superconductors is largely suppressed or completely
absent, respectively, depending on the actual value of the on-site Coulomb
repulsion of the Ru4d orbitals. Also the presence of a characteristic
$\Lambda_{1}$-mode with a very steep dispersion coupling strongly with the
electrons is missing in Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$. Moreover, we evaluate the
possibility of a phonon-plasmon scenario for Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$ which has been
shown recently to be realistic for La$_{2}$CuO$_{4}$. In contrast to
La$_{2}$CuO$_{4}$ in Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$ the very low lying plasmons are

investigated using a vertically-pointing Doppler lidar. Strong specular
reflections were observed from their oriented basal facets, identified by
comparison with a second lidar pointing 4deg from zenith. Analysis of 17 months
of continuous high-resolution observations reveal that these pristine crystals
are frequently observed in ice falling from mid-level mixed-phase layer clouds
(85% of the time for layers at -15C). Detailed analysis of a case study
indicates that the crystals are nucleated and grow rapidly within the
supercooled layer, then fall out, forming well-defined layers of specular
reflection. From the lidar alone the fraction of oriented crystals cannot be
quantified, but polarimetric radar measurements confirmed that a substantial
fraction of the crystal population was well oriented. As the crystals fall into
subsaturated air, specular reflection is observed to switch off as the crystal
faces become rounded and lose their faceted structure. Specular reflection in
ice falling from supercooled layers colder than -22C was also observed, but was
much less pronounced than at warmer temperatures: we suggest that in cold
clouds it is the small droplets in the distribution that freeze into plates and
produce specular reflection, whilst larger droplets freeze into complex
polycrystals. The lidar Doppler measurements show that typical fall speeds for
the oriented crystals are 0.3m/s, with a weak temperature correlation; the
corresponding Reynolds number is Re~10, in agreement with light-pillar
measurements. Coincident Doppler radar observations show no correlation between

mechanics from local hidden variable theories. Such tests are performed by
measuring correlations of two entangled particles (e.g. polarization of photons
or spins of atoms). In order to constitute conclusive evidence, two conditions
have to be satisfied. First, strict separation of the measurement events in the
sense of special relativity is required (""locality loophole""). Second, almost
all entangled pairs have to be detected (for particles in a maximally entangled
state the required detector efficiency is 82.8%), which is hard to achieve
experimentally (""detection loophole""). By using the recently demonstrated
entanglement between single trapped atoms and single photons it becomes
possible to entangle two atoms at a large distance via entanglement swapping.
Combining the high detection efficiency achieved with atoms with the space-like
separation of the atomic state detection events, both loopholes can be closed
within the same experiment. In this paper we present estimations based on
current experimental achievements which show that such an experiment is
feasible in future.

both processes (elastic scattering and stimulated emission) seem to exclude one
another: pumping atoms to make them behave as amplifier reduces drastically
their scattering cross-section. However, we show that even the simplest atom
model allows the efficient combination of gain and scattering. Moreover,
supplementary degrees of freedom that atoms offer allow the use of several gain
mechanisms, depending on the pumping scheme. We thus first study these
different gain mechanisms and show experimentally that they can induce
(standard) lasing. We then present how the constraint of combining scattering

that the functional form of the word-frequency distribution of a novel depends

changes with the size of the text-section which is analyzed. A further
consequence is that a novel cannot be described by text-evolution models like

addition enables a more precise determination of the functional form of the

bond energy budget of H2 is distributed between the reaction site and the
internal energy of the molecule. So far, the non-detection of excited nascent
H2 in dense quiescent clouds could be a sign that either predictions of
emission line intensities are not correct or the de-excitation of the newly
formed molecules proceeds rapidly on the grain surface itself. In this letter
we present experimental evidence that interstellar molecular hydrogen is formed
and then rapidly de-excited on the surface of porous water ice mantles. In
addition, although we detect ro-vibrationally excited nascent molecules
desorbing from a bare non-porous (compact) water ice film, we demonstrate that
the amount of excited nascent hydrogen molecules is significantly reduced no
matter the morphology of the water ice substrate at 10 K (both on non-porous
and on porous water ice) in a regime of high molecular coverage as is the case
in dark molecular clouds.

integration (VCI), often refered to as dynamic binary rewriting. This article
will try to demonstrate all of the techniques that were applied in the
SpiderPig project. It will also discuss the main differences between the
methods that were employed and those used in other available software, as well
as introducing other related work. SpiderPig's approach was found to be very
fast and was transparent enough for reliable and usable data flow analysis. It
was created with the purpose of providing a tool which would aid vulnerability
and security researchers with tracing and analyzing any necessary data and its
further propagation through a program. At the current state it works on IA-32
platforms with Microsoft Windows systems and it supports FPU, SSE, MMX and all
of the IA-32 general instructions. SpiderPig also demonstrates the usage of a
virtual code integration (VCI) framework which allows for modifying the target
application code at the instruction level. By this I mean that the VCI
framework allows for custom code insertion, original code modification and full
customization of the original application's code. Instructions can be swapped
out, deleted or modified at a whim, without corrupting the surrounding code and
side-effects of the modification are resolved.

which a strong low-frequency and a weak high-frequency laser field propagate in

electron-positron pair production rate is calculated analytically in the limit
in which in the nucleus rest frame the strong field is undercritical and the
frequency of the weak field is below and close to the pair production
threshold. By changing the frequency of the weak field one can reduce the
tunneling barrier substantially. As a result tunneling pair production is shown
to be observable with presently available technology.

hyperfine A and exchange J interactions. This high-fidelity CNOT gate has an
error of about $10^{-6}$, below the error threshold required for fault-tolerant
quantum computation, and its operation time of 100ns is about 3 times faster
than 297ns of the proposed global control scheme. It also relaxes significantly
the stringent distance constraint of two neighboring donor atoms of 10~20nm as
reported in the original Kane's proposal to about 30nm in which surface A and J
gates may be built with current fabrication technology. The effects of the
control voltage fluctuations, the dipole-dipole interaction and the electron

micron thermal continuum emission from 9 of the brightest, and therefore most
massive, circumstellar disks in the ~1 Myr-old Ophiuchus star-forming region.
Using 2-D radiative transfer calculations, we simultaneously fit the observed
continuum visibilities and broadband spectral energy distribution for each disk
with a parametric structure model. Compared to previous millimeter studies,
this survey includes significant upgrades in modeling, data quality, and
angular resolution that provide improved constraints on key structure
parameters, particularly those that characterize the spatial distribution of
mass in the disks. In the context of a surface density profile motivated by
similarity solutions for viscous accretion disks, the best-fit models for the
sample disks have characteristic radii R_c = 20-200 AU, high disk masses M_d =
0.005-0.14 M_sun, and a narrow range of radial surface density gradients around
a median $\gamma$ = 0.9. These density structures are used in conjunction with
accretion rate estimates from the literature to help characterize the viscous
evolution of the disk material. Using the standard prescription for disk
viscosities, those combined constraints indicate that $\alpha$ = 0.0005-0.08.
Three of the sample disks show large (R = 20-40 AU) central cavities in their
continuum emission morphologies, marking extensive zones where dust has been
physically removed and/or has significantly diminished opacities. Based on the
current requirements of planet formation models, these emission cavities and
the structure constraints for the sample as a whole suggest that these young
disks may eventually produce planetary systems, and have perhaps already
started. (abridged)

single-molecule magnet (SMM) in which the quantum tunneling of magnetization

resonance appearing only at elevated temperatures demonstrates tunneling
between excited states with spin projections differing by a multiple of three:
this is dictated by the C3 symmetry of the molecule, which forbids pure
tunneling from the lowest metastable state. Resonances forbidden by the
molecular symmetry are explained by correctly orienting the Jahn-Teller axes of
the individual manganese ions, and by including transverse dipolar fields.
These factors are likely to be important for QTM in all SMMs.
