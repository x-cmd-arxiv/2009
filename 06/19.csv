sample of nearby white dwarfs with possible excess flux as identified primarily
in the Two Micron All Sky Survey. Among the sample of 43 stars are a number of
white dwarfs that are either metal-rich, magnetic, or binary suspects. With a
few notable exceptions in four (or possibly five) distinct categories, the
newly obtained JHK photometric data fail to corroborate the putative excesses,
with K_IRTF - K_2MASS = +0.31 mag. Where available, GALEX photometric data are
used to better constrain the overall spectral energy distribution of the white
dwarfs, enabling any excess near-infrared flux to stand out more readily
against the expected stellar photosphere.
  With superior data, a near-infrared photometric excess is confirmed at three
metal-rich white dwarfs and ruled out at nine others. Several new binaries are
confirmed or suggested; five white dwarf - red dwarf pairs and five double
degenerates. Four apparently single magnetic white dwarfs -- two DA and two DQp
-- display modest to strong near-infrared excess (relative to non-magnetic
models), which may be better described as two effective temperatures owing to a
redistribution of energy in highly magnetic or peculiar atmospheres.

model transposable data, we present a modification of the matrix-variate
normal, the mean-restricted matrix-variate normal, in which the rows and
columns each have a separate mean vector and covariance matrix. By placing
additive penalties on the inverse covariance matrices of the rows and columns,
these so-called transposable regularized covariance models allow for maximum
likelihood estimation of the mean and nonsingular covariance matrices. Using
these models, we formulate EM-type algorithms for missing data imputation in
both the multivariate and transposable frameworks. We present theoretical
results exploiting the structure of our transposable models that allow these
models and imputation methods to be applied to high-dimensional data.
Simulations and results on microarray data and the Netflix data show that these
imputation techniques often outperform existing methods and offer a greater
degree of flexibility.

neither requires the construction of iterated Ito integrals nor the evaluation

Euler step is used to take a fractional step. This fractional point is then
combined with the initial point to obtain a higher order, trapezoidal like,
approximation. The higher order of accuracy stems from the fact that both the

scalar field theories of the Lifshitz type, i.e. with different scaling in

spatial derivative terms that modify the particle propagator at high energies,
but at the expense of explicitly breaking Lorentz symmetry. We study if and
under what conditions the Lorentz symmetry can be considered as emergent at low
energies by studying the RG evolution of the ``speed of light'' coupling
$c^2_\phi$ and, for more than one field, of $\delta c^2\equiv
c^2_{\phi_1}-c^2_{\phi_2}$ in simple models. We find that in the UV both
$c^2_\phi$ and $\delta c^2$ generally flow logarithmically with the energy
scale. A logarithmic running of $c^2$ persists also at low-energies, if $\delta
c^2 \neq 0$ in the UV. As a result, Lorentz symmetry is not recovered at low
energies with the accuracy needed to withstand basic experimental constraints,
unless all the Lorentz breaking terms, including $\delta c^2$, are unnaturally
fine-tuned to extremely small values in the UV. We expect that the
considerations of this paper will apply to any generic theory of Lifshitz type,

monodromy of the defining hypergeometric differential equation becomes finite.
It is shown that many algebraic ${}_nF_{n-1}$'s, for which the finite monodromy
is irreducible but imprimitive, can be represented as combinations of certain
explicitly algebraic functions of a single variable; namely, the roots of
trinomials. This generalizes a result of Birkeland, and is derived as a
corollary of a family of binomial coefficient identities that is of independent
interest. Any tuple of roots of a trinomial traces out a projective algebraic
curve, and it is also determined when this so-called Schwarz curve is of genus
zero and can be rationally parametrized. Any such parametrization yields a
hypergeometric identity that explicitly uniformizes a family of algebraic
${}_nF_{n-1}$'s. Many examples of such uniformizations are worked out
explicitly. Even when the governing Schwarz curve is of positive genus, it is
shown how it is sometimes possible to construct explicit single-valued or
multivalued parametrizations of individual algebraic ${}_nF_{n-1}$'s, by
parametrizing a quotiented Schwarz curve. The parametrization requires
computations in rings of symmetric polynomials.

opportunity to obtain direct measurements for the basic physical properties,
such as mass and radius of these objects. These planets are therefore highly
important in the understanding of the evolution and formation of planetary
systems: from the observations of photometric transits, the interior structure
of the planet and atmospheric properties can also be constrained. The most
efficient way to search for transiting extrasolar planets is based on
wide-field surveys by hunting for short and shallow periodic dips in light
curves covering quite long time intervals. These surveys monitor fields with
several degrees in diameter and tens or hundreds of thousands of objects
simultaneously. In the practice of astronomical observations, surveys of large
field-of-view are rather new and therefore require special methods for
photometric data reduction that have not been used before. In this PhD thesis,
I summarize my efforts related to the development of a complete software
solution for high precision photometric reduction of astronomical images. I
also demonstrate the role of this newly developed package and the related
algorithms in the case of particular discoveries of the HATNet project.

clusters. This article, the first of a series dedicated to the study of IRDCs,
describes techniques developed to establish a complete catalogue of Spitzer
IRDCs in the Galaxy. We have analysed Spitzer GLIMPSE and MIPSGAL data to
identify a complete sample of IRDCs in the region of Galactic longitude and
latitude 10deg < |l|<65deg and |b|<1deg. From the 8micron observations we have
constructed opacity maps and used a newly developed extraction algorithm to
identify structures above a column density of N_{H2} > 1x10^{22} cm^{-2}. The
24micron data are then used to characterize the star formation activity of each
extracted cloud. A total of 11303 clouds have been extracted. A comparison with
the existing MSX based catalogue of IRDCs shows that 80% of these Spitzer dark
clouds were previously unknown. The algorithm also extracts ~ 20000 to 50000
fragments within these clouds, depending on detection threshold used. A first
look at the MIPSGAL data indicates that between 20% and 68% of these IRDCs show
24micron point-like association. This new database provides an important
resource for future studies aiming to understand the initial conditions of star

Lorenz-96 model is a continuous in time and discrete in space model first

of spatially extended chaotic systems such as the atmosphere. First, we explore
the spatiotemporal chaos limit by increasing the system size while holding the
magnitude of the external forcing constant. Second, we explore the strong
driving limit by increasing the external forcing while holding the system size
fixed. As the system size is increased for small values of the forcing we find
dynamical states that alternate between periodic and chaotic dynamics. The
windows of chaos are extensive, on average, with relative deviations from
extensivity on the order of 20%. For intermediate values of the forcing we find
chaotic dynamics for all system sizes past a critical value. The fractal
dimension exhibits a maximum deviation from extensivity on the order of 5% for
small changes in system size and decreases non-monotonically with increasing
system size. The length scale describing the deviations from extensivity and
the natural chaotic length scale are approximately equal in support of the
suggestion that deviations from extensivity are due to the addition of chaotic
degrees of freedom as the system size is increased. As the forcing is increased
at constant system size the fractal dimension exhibits a power-law dependence.
The power-law behavior is independent of the system size and quantifies the
decreasing size of chaotic degrees of freedom with increased forcing which we
compare with spatial features of the patterns.

many hidden, small-scale processes. Examples include age of disease onset,
rates of amino acid substitutions, and composition of ecological communities.
The macroscopic patterns in each problem often vary around a characteristic
shape that can be generated by neutral processes. A neutral generative model
assumes that each microscopic process follows unbiased stochastic fluctuations:
random connections of network nodes; amino acid substitutions with no effect on
fitness; species that arise or disappear from communities randomly. These
neutral generative models often match common patterns of nature. In this paper,
I present the theoretical background by which we can understand why these
neutral generative models are so successful. I show how the classic patterns
such as Poisson and Gaussian arise. Each classic pattern was often discovered
by a simple neutral generative model. The neutral patterns share a special
characteristic: they describe the patterns of nature that follow from simple
constraints on information. For example, any aggregation of processes that
preserves information only about the mean and variance attracts to the Gaussian
pattern; any aggregation that preserves information only about the mean
attracts to the exponential pattern; any aggregation that preserves information
only about the geometric mean attracts to the power law pattern. I present an
informational framework of the common patterns of nature based on the method of
maximum entropy. This framework shows that each neutral generative model is a
special case that helps to discover a particular set of informational
constraints; those informational constraints define a much wider domain of
non-neutral generative processes that attract to the same neutral pattern.

energy of odd-nuclei by only few tenths of keV, while the time-odd components
of standard Skyrme interactions give an effect that is larger by one order of
magnitude. The HFB-17 mass formula based on a Skyrme parametrization is
adjusted including the new spin-density dependent terms. A comprehensive study
of binding energies in the whole mass table of 2149 nuclei gives a root mean
square (rms) deviation of 0.575 MeV between experimental data and the
calculated results, which is slightly better than the original HFB-17 mass

restrictions on the parameters governing the spin-density dependent terms are
evaluated. We conclude that with the extended Skyrme interaction, the Landau

We obtained complementary observations over a single night in the J and Ks

galaxy formation, which predicts the full star formation and galaxy merger
histories, and the GRASIL spectro-photometric code, which carries out a
self-consistent calculation of the SED, including absorption and emission of
radiation by dust. Using a small number of galaxy properties predicted by
GALFORM, the method reproduces the luminosities of galaxies in the majority of
cases to within 10% of those computed directly using GRASIL. The method
performs best in the sub-mm and reasonably well in the mid-infrared and the
far-ultra-violet. The luminosity error introduced by the method has negligible
impact on predicted statistical distributions, such as luminosity functions or
colour distributions of galaxies. We use the neural net to predict the overlap
between galaxies selected in the rest-frame UV and in the observer-frame sub-mm

principle can be understood in terms of discrete scale invariance involving the
spatial, temporal and dynamic parameters of all systems and phenomena. This new
paradigm predicts a rigorous discrete self-similarity between Stellar Scale
variable stars and Atomic Scale excited atoms undergoing energy-level
transitions and sub-threshold oscillations. Previously, methods for
demonstrating and testing the proposed symmetry principle have been applied to
RR Lyrae, Delta Scuti and ZZ Ceti variable stars. In the present paper we apply

general 2-variable clauses, which can be any integer-valued functions of pairs
of boolean variables. This allows an algorithm to use both efficient reductions
specific to AND and OR clauses, and other powerful reductions that require the
general CSP setting. We use new reductions introduced here, and recent
reductions such as ""clause-learning"" and ""2-reductions"" generalized to our
setting's mixture of simple and general clauses.
  Parametrizing an instance by the fraction p of non-simple clauses, we give an
exact (exponential-time) algorithm that is the fastest known polynomial-space
algorithm for p=0 (which includes the well-studied Max 2-Sat problem but also
instances with arbitrary mixtures of AND and OR clauses); the only efficient
algorithm for mixtures of AND, OR, and general integer-valued clauses; and tied
for fastest for general Max 2-CSP (p=1). Since a pure 2-Sat input instance may
be transformed to a general CSP instance in the course of being solved, the
algorithm's efficiency and generality go hand in hand.
  Our algorithm analysis and optimization are a variation on the familiar
measure-and-conquer approach, resulting in an optimizing mathematical program
that is convex not merely quasi-convex, and thus can be solved efficiently and
with a certificate of optimality. We produce a family of running-time
upper-bound formulas, each optimized for instances with a particular value of p
but valid for all instances.

result of a nanoscale mixture of ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic regions

in AC magnetic measurements, its magnitude is not sufficient to account for the
observed dramatic exchange bias. Furthermore, isothermal and thermoremanent
magnetization measurements distinguish this material from a pure spin glass.

consequence of this result, any subset of such a solvable group of small

demonstrate that the tunneling conductance in this system can be strongly
enhanced compared to a pure SrTiO3 barrier due to resonant tunneling, but that

parallel tempering in calculating the heat capacity is more than an order of

Gyr ago, with a good reproduction of the abundance distribution function of
field stars in the SMC. Furthermore, our models predict a relatively large
scatter in [Mg/Fe] for -1.4 < [Fe/H] <-1.1 as a reflection of a looping feature
resulting from the temporally inverse progress of chemical enrichment, which
can be tested against future observational results. Given that the observed
velocity dispersion (~30 km/s) of the SMC is much smaller than that (~160 km/s)
of the Galactic halo, our finding strongly implies that the predicted merger
event happened in a small group environment that was far from the Galaxy and
contained a number of small gas-rich dwarfs comparable to the SMC. This
theoretical view is extensively discussed in the framework that considers a
connection with the formation history of the Large Magellanic cloud.

not require any new field beyond the standard model, but rather can be
explained as a result of the interaction of the infrared sector of the
effective theory of gravity with standard model fields. The cosmological
constant in this framework can be presented in terms of QCD parameters and the
Hubble constant $H$ as follows, $\epsilon_{vac} \sim H \cdot m_q\la\bar{q}q\ra
/m_{\eta'} \sim (4.3\cdot 10^{-3} \text{eV})^4$, which is amazingly close to
the observed value today. In this work we explain how this proposal can be
tested by analyzing CMB data. In particular, knowing the value of the observed
cosmological constant fixes univocally the smallest size of the spatially flat,
constant time 3d hypersurface which, for instance in the case of an effective
1-torus, is predicted to be around 74 Gpc. We also comment on another important
prediction of this framework which is a violation of cosmological isotropy.
Such anisotropy is indeed apparently observed by WMAP, and will be confirmed
(or ruled out) by future PLANCK data.

Hubble Space Telescope is a primary source of uncertainty in stellar photometry
obtained with this camera. This effect, discovered shortly after the camera was
installed, has grown over time and can dim stars by several tenths of a
magnitude (or even more, in particularly bad cases). The impact of CTE loss on
WFPC2 stellar photometry was characterized by several studies between 1998 and
2000, but has received diminished attention since ACS became HST's primary
imager. After the failure of ACS in January 2007, WFPC2 once again became the
primary imaging instrument onboard HST, restoring the importance of ensuring
accurate CTE corrections.
  This paper re-examines the CTE loss of WFPC2, with three significant changes
over previous studies. First, the present study considers calibration data
obtained through 2007, thus increasing the confidence in the reliability of the
CTE corrections when applied to recent observations. Second, the change in CTE
loss during readout is accounted for analytically. Finally, a reanalysis of the
CTE dependencies on counts, background, and observation date was made. The
resulting correction is significantly more accurate than that provided in the
WFPC2 Instrument Handbook (Dolphin 2002 and updates through 2004), resulting in
photometry that can be enhanced by over 5% in certain circumstances.

their ""e-invisible"" subsets: parts of the attractors whose neighborhoods are
visited by orbits with an average frequency of less than e << 1. For
extraordinarily small values of e (say, smaller than 2^(-10^6)), an observer
virtually never sees these parts when following a generic orbit.
  A trivial reason for e-invisibility in a generic dynamical system may be
either a high Lipshitz constant (~1/e) of the mapping (i.e. it badly distorts
the metric) or its proximity (~e) to the structurally unstable dynamical
systems. However Ilyashenko and Negut [IN] provided a locally typical example
of dynamical systems with an e-invisible set and a uniform moderate (<100)
Lipshitz constant independent on e. These dynamical systems from [IN] are also
|log e|^{-1}-distant from structurally unstable dynamical systems (in the class
S of skew products).
  We further develop the example of [IN] to provide a better rate of
invisibility while staying at the same distance away from the structurally
unstable dynamical systems. We give an explicit example of C^1-balls in the
space of ""step"" skew products over the Bernoulli shift such that for each
dynamical system from this ball a large portion of the statistical attractor is
invisible. Systems that are c/n-distant from structurally unstable ones (in the
class S) have rate of invisibility e = 2^(-n^k) where 3k is the Hausdorff
dimension of the phase space.

access methods that can scale to large databases. In this paper, we propose a
solution to this problem of querying significant image subregions. We design a

extends to any image descriptor. All the images are tiled and each alignment of
the query and a database image produces a tile score matrix. We show that the
problem of finding the best connected subregion from this matrix is NP-hard and
develop a dynamic programming heuristic. With this heuristic, we develop two
index based scalable search strategies, TARS and SPARS, to query patterns in a
large image repository. These strategies are general enough to work with other
scoring schemes and heuristics. Experimental results on real image datasets
show that TARS saves more than 87% query time on small queries, and SPARS saves
up to 52% query time on large queries as compared to linear search. Qualitative
tests on synthetic and real datasets achieve precision of more than 80%.

nearest-neighbor (nn) Coulomb correlation and {nearest-neighbor} Heisenberg
exchange. The complete eigensystem was computed exactly for all electron
occupancies and all model parameters ranging from minus infinity to plus
infinity. For two electrons on the cluster the eigensystem is given in
analytical form. For six electrons and infinite on-site correlation U we
determinded the groundstate and the groundstate energy of the pure Hubbard
model analytically. For fixed electron numbers we found a multitude of ground
state level crossings in dependence on the various model parameters.
Furthermore the groundstates of the pure Hubbard model in dependence on a
magnetic field h coupled to the spins are shown for the complete U-h plane. For
the cubic cluster gas we calculated the density $n(\mu,T,h)$ and the
thermodynamical density of states from the grand potential. The ground states
and the various spin-spin correlation functions are studied for both attractive
and repulsive values of the three interaction constants. The anomalous
degeneration lines are calculated. For the cases where these lines end in
triple points we give the related parameter values. The influence of the
nn-exchange and the nn-Coulomb correlation onto the anomalous degeneration is
discussed.

attention lately, mostly in the context of l1-regularization. Part of the
attraction is the variable selection effect: parsimonious models are obtained,
which are very suitable for interpretation. In terms of predictive power,
however, these regularized linear models are often slightly inferior to machine
learning procedures like tree ensembles. Tree ensembles, on the other hand,
lack usually a formal way of variable selection and are difficult to visualize.
A Garrote-style convex penalty for trees ensembles, in particular Random
Forests, is proposed. The penalty selects functional groups of nodes in the
trees. These could be as simple as monotone functions of individual predictor
variables. This yields a parsimonious function fit, which lends itself easily
to visualization and interpretation. The predictive power is maintained at
least at the same level as the original tree ensemble. A key feature of the
method is that, once a tree ensemble is fitted, no further tuning parameter
needs to be selected. The empirical performance is demonstrated on a wide array
of datasets.

performed at a frequency of 1 Hz in the temperature range of 20 to 220\degree
C. When a periodic solicitation is applied to an elementary fibre, an increase
of the fibre rigidity and a reduction of the damping capacity are observed.
These evolutions aim at stabilization after an identified number of cycles,
traducing a phenomenon of ""adaptation"". This specific mechanical behaviour
certainly involves biochemical and/or structural modifications in the material
organisation as microfibrils reorientation. In addition, the behaviour of hemp
fibres is affected by temperature. Temperature acts as an activation factor but
also as a degradation factor of the viscoelastic properties of fibres. The
rigidity and the endurance of fibres are highly affected by thermal treatment
at temperature above 150\degree C to 180\degree C. Taking into account these
results, polypropylene-hemp fibres composites were manufactured using a
specific processing cycle. By respecting the integrity of fibres during
manufacturing, it appears that the relatively high level of the specific
mechanical properties of composites is really encouraging in sight of
applications requiring high mechanical performances.

astrophysical environments. A possible indicator for a grain of ONe nova origin
is a large 33S abundance: nucleosynthesis calculations predict as much as 150
times the solar abundance of 33S in the ejecta of nova explosions on massive
ONe white dwarfs. This overproduction factor may, however, vary by factors of
at least 0.01 - 3 because of uncertainties of several orders of magnitude in
the 33S(p,gamma)34Cl reaction rate at nova peak temperatures (Tpeak ~ 0.1 - 0.4
GK). These uncertainties arise due to the lack of nuclear physics information
for states within ~ 600 keV of the 33S+p threshold in 34Cl (Sp(34Cl) = 5143
keV). To better constrain this rate we have measured, for the first time, the
34S(3He,t)34Cl reaction over the region Ex(34Cl) = 4.9 - 6 MeV. We confirm
previous states and find 15 new states in this energy region. New
33S(p,gamma)34Cl resonances at ER = 281(2), 301(2) and 342(2) keV may dominate
this rate at relevant nova temperatures. Our results could affect predictions
of sulphur isotopic ratios in nova ejecta (e.g., 32S/33S) that may be used as
diagnostic tools for the nova paternity of grains.

tested in water-saturated conditions, in radial and tangential directions. As
expected, the radial direction always revealed a higher storage modulus than
the tangential direction. Great differences were also observed in the loss
factor. The tan\delta peak and the internal friction are higher in tangential
direction than in radial direction. This behaviour is attributed to the fact
that anatomical elements act depending on the direction. Viscoelastic behaviour
of reaction wood differs from that of normal or opposite wood. Compression wood
of spruce, which has higher lignin content, is denser and stiffer in transverse
directions than normal wood, and has lower softening temperature (Tg). In
tension wood, the G-layer is weakly attached to the rest of the wall layers.
This may explain why the storage modulus and the softening temperature of
tension wood are lower than those for the opposite wood. In this work, we also
point out that the time-temperature equivalence fits only around the transition
region, i.e. between Tg and Tg + 30\degree C. Apart from these regions, the
wood response combines the effect of all constitutive polymers, so that the

treatment is applied for several hours, a reduction of the wood rigidity is
significant from temperature values as low as 80-90\degree C, and increases
rapidly with the temperature level. The storage modulus of oak wood is divided
by a factor two after three hours of exposure at 135\degree C. This marked
reduction in rigidity is attributed to the hydrolysis of hemicelluloses. The

this paper, micromachined piezoelectric membranes are introduced as a potential
alternative to the cantilevers for biological applications. HighQ-factors (up
to 150) of micromachined piezoelectric membranes resonating in various liquid
mixtures (water/glycerol and water/ethanol) are thus reported and a theoretical
model proposed by Lamb [H. Lamb, On the vibrations of an elastic plate in

conclude, two types of experiments were performed in water/glycerol mixtures:
in-flow (with liquid continuously flowing on the devices) and in-spot (with
individual membranes oscillating in a 5 $\mu$L volume of liquid). The results
interestingly showed that for the in-spot configuration the Q-factor values are
more than two-fold the ones corresponding to in-flow measurements thus

suppress reheating. In a simple physical picture of sideband cooling, the atoms
shape the cavity profile to enhance/inhibit scattering into higher/lower energy

framework that allows both for the limitations of the model as a description of
the propagation of the climate state vector, and for parametric uncertainty.
Our inference takes the form of a data assimilation with unknown static

l is unambiguously identified for two of them: l = 0 and l = 3 for the

non-linear and highly dominant with an amplitude in the U-filter about 15 times
larger than the strongest of the other modes. For the third frequency of

radial velocities, the dominant radial mode presents a so-called stillstand but
no clear evidence of the existence of shocks is observed. Four low-amplitude

light curve have been attributed to both late time inner engine activity and
density changes in the medium surrounding the burster. To test the latter, we
study the encounter between the relativistic blast wave from a gamma-ray
burster and a stellar wind termination shock. The blast wave is simulated using
a high performance adaptive mesh relativistic hydrodynamics code, AMRVAC, and
the synchrotron emission is analyzed in detail with a separate radiation code.
We find no bump in the resulting light curve, not even for very high density
jumps. Furthermore, by analyzing the contributions from the different shock
wave regions we are able to establish that it is essential to resolve the blast
wave structure in order to make qualitatively correct predictions on the
observed output and that the contribution from the reverse shock region will
not stand out, even when the magnetic field is increased in this region by
repeated shocks. This study resolves a controversy in recent literature.

stronger than, the velocity gradient of L183 as a whole, as detected in

collapsing core undergoing spin-up. The inferred axis of rotation is parallel
to the magnetic field direction, which is offset from its long axis, as we have
seen in other pre-stellar cores. Therefore, we propose that we have detected a

burster of the Galactic Center. It is transient, faint, and located in a very
crowded region, only 10 arcmin from the supermassive black hole Sgr A*.
Therefore, its bursting behavior has been poorly studied so far. In particular,
its persistent emission has rarely been detected between consecutive bursts,
due to lack of sensitivity or confusion. This is what made GRS 1741.9-2853 one
of the nine ""burst-only sources"" identified by BeppoSAX a few years ago. The
physical properties of GRS 1741.9-2853 bursts are yet of great interest since
we know very little about the nuclear regimes at stake in low accretion rate
bursters. We examine here for the first time several bursts in relation with
the persistent emission of the source, using INTEGRAL, XMM-Newton, and Swift
observations. We investigate the source flux variability and bursting behavior
during its 2005 and 2007 long outbursts. The persistent luminosity of GRS
1741.9-2853 varied between ~1.7 and 10.5 10^36 erg s^-1, i.e. 0.9-5.3% of the
Eddington luminosity. The shape of the spectrum as described by an absorbed
power-law remained with a photon index Gamma ~ 2 and a column density $N_{\rm
H} ~ 12 10^22 cm^-2 throughout the outbursts. We discovered 11 type-I bursts
with INTEGRAL, and inspected 4 additional bursts: 2 recorded by XMM-Newton and
2 by Swift. From the brigthest burst, we derive an upper limit on the source
distance of ~7 kpc. The observed bursts characteristics and source accretion
rate suggest pure helium explosions igniting at column depths y_{ign} ~ 0.8-4.8
10^8 g cm^-1, for typical energy releases of ~1.2-7.4 10^39 erg.

gathered over the 40-year time span between 1969 and 2008. During this
interval, the pulsar experienced eight glitch-like events with a fractional
increase in the rotation frequency Deltanu/nu=(0.9-2.6)x10^{-9}. We have
revealed two important relations in the properties of these peculiar glitches.
The first result shows that there is a strong linear correlation between the
amplitude of the glitch and the time interval to the next glitch. The second
result shows that the amplitude of the glitches is modulated by a periodic
large-scale sawtooth-like function. As a result of this modulation, the glitch
amplitude varies discretely from glitch to glitch with a step of 1.5x10^{-9} Hz
in the range (2.4-6.9)x10^{-9} Hz. The post-glitch time interval also varies
discretely with a step of about 600 days in the range 900-2700 days. An
analysis of the data showed that three modulation schemes with modulation
periods of 43 years, 53 years and 60 years are possible. The best model is the
60-year modulation scheme including 12 glitches. We make a conclusion that the
nature of the observed cyclical changes in the timing residuals from PSR
B1642-03 is a continuous generation of peculiar glitches whose amplitudes are
modulated by a periodic large-scale sawtooth-like function. As the modulation
function is periodical, the picture of cyclical timing residuals will be
exactly repeated in each modulation period or every 60 years.

measure single-particle dispersion coefficients, but this only uses one
trajectory at a time, so much of the information on relative motion is lost. In
some circumstances the trajectories happen to remain close long enough to
measure finite-time Lyapunov exponents, but this is rare. We propose to use
tools from braid theory and the topology of surface mappings to approximate the
topological entropy of the underlying flow. The procedure uses all the

observed surface brightness (from deep HST/ACS observations), PSF and slit
effects into account. Our dynamical masses M_Jeans agree within ~30% with
virial estimates M_vir=5*Re*sigma^2/G, although the latter tend to be smaller.
This suggests that sizes are not underestimated by more than a similar
fraction. Our M_Jeans also agrees within a factor <2 with the M_pop previously
derived using stellar population models and 11 bands photometry. This confirms
that the galaxies are intrinsically massive. The inferred mass-to-light ratios

shallow chemical concentration gradients using cell-surface receptors. This

cell-surface receptors by diffusion. An additional challenge and source of
uncertainty is that particles, once bound and released, may rebind the same or
a different receptor, which adds to noise without providing any new information
about the environment. We recently derived the fundamental physical limits of
gradient sensing using a simple spherical-cell model, but not including
explicit particle-receptor kinetics. Here, we use a method based on the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) to calculate the accuracy of gradient
sensing by realistic receptors. We derive analytical results for two receptors,
as well as two coaxial rings of receptors, e.g. one at each cell pole. For
realistic receptors, we find that particle rebinding lowers the accuracy of
gradient sensing, in line with our previous results.

entire function with zeros all located on the negative part of the real axis
$\R$. We consider Dyson's model with $\beta=2$ starting from the first $N$
zeros of $\Ai(z)$, $0 > a_1 > ... > a_N$, $N \geq 2$. In order to properly
control the effect of such initial confinement of particles in the negative

relaxation process from the configuration, in which every zero of $\Ai(z)$ on
the negative $\R$ is occupied by one particle, to the stationary state

The location of Segue 1 is close to crossings of the tidal wraps of the

different wraps of the Sagittarius stream. We show that Segue 1 is moving with
a velocity that is close to one of the wraps. At this location, we estimate
that there are enough Sagittarius stars, indistinguishable from Segue 1 stars,

completely the behavior of single agents who start acting according to a social

which are tight as $M,K\to\infty$. In the course of this derivation, the
per-user channel correlation model requires the development of a novel
deterministic equivalent of the empirical Stieltjes transform of large

magnetic field upon the turbulent motion results in a decrease of the
turbulence level and therefore in a suppression of both the magnetic field
amplification (the alpha-quenching effect) and the turbulent magnetic
diffusivity (the eta-quenching effect). While the former has been widely
explored, the effects of eta-quenching in the magnetic field evolution have
rarely been considered. In this work we investigate the role of the suppression
of diffusivity in a flux-transport solar dynamo model that also includes a
non-linear alpha-quenching term. Our results indicate that, although for
alpha-quenching the dependence of the magnetic field amplification with the
quenching factor is nearly linear, the magnetic field response to eta-quenching
is non-linear and spatially non-uniform. We have found that the magnetic field
can be locally amplified in this case, forming long-lived structures whose
maximum amplitude can be up to ~2.5 times larger at the tachocline and up to ~2
times larger at the center of the convection zone than in models without
quenching. However, this amplification leads to unobservable effects and to a
worse distribution of the magnetic field in the butterfly diagram. Since the
dynamo cycle period increases when the efficiency of the quenching increases,
we have also explored whether the eta-quenching can cause a diffusion-dominated
model to drift into an advection-dominated regime. We have found that models
undergoing a large suppression of the diffusivity produce a strong segregation
of magnetic fields that may lead to unsteady dynamo-oscillations. On the other
hand, an initially diffusion-dominated model undergoing a small suppression in
eta remains in the diffusion-dominated regime.

of gravitational waves and the primordial production of this scalar component
which is generated beside tensorial one. Then we analyze different viable
$f(R)$-gravities towards the Solar System tests and stochastic gravitational
waves background. The aim is to achive experimental bounds for the theory at
local and cosmological scales in order to select models capable of addressing
the accelerating cosmological expansion without cosmological constant but
evading the weak field constraints. It is demonstrated that viable
$f(R)$-gravities under consideration not only satisfy the local tests, but
additionally, pass the PPN-and stochastic gravitational waves bounds for large
classes of parameters.

to the puzzling missing number of AGB stars with respect to theoretical
predictions and former stages of evolution. Observations and AGB models have
advanced steadily in the following decades providing us with an almost complete
view of the AGB stars in the Magellanic Clouds. Their properties are tracers of
structure and chemistry across galaxies. New surveys will be able to fill-in
the gaps, in terms of sensitivity and monitoring, providing new constraints for
the formation and evolution of the Magellanic Clouds.

that is the minimum number of singlets needed by two distant parties to create
a single copy of the state up to a finite accuracy, using local operations and
classical communication only. This analysis, in contrast to the traditional
one, pertains to scenarios of practical relevance, in which resources are
finite and transformations can only be achieved approximately. Moreover, it
unveils a fundamental relation between two well-known entanglement measures,
namely, the Schmidt number and the entanglement of formation. Using this
relation, we are able to recover the usual expression of the entanglement cost
as a special case.

CO in many astrophysical environments, ranging from interstellar clouds to
protoplanetary disks. The aim of this work is to gain a better understanding of
the depth dependence and isotope-selective nature of this process.
  Methods. We present a photodissociation model based on recent spectroscopic
data from the literature, which allows us to compute depth-dependent and
isotope-selective photodissociation rates at higher accuracy than in previous
work. The model includes self-shielding, mutual shielding and shielding by
atomic and molecular hydrogen, and it is the first such model to include the
rare isotopologues C17O and 13C17O. We couple it to a simple chemical network
to analyse CO abundances in diffuse and translucent clouds, photon-dominated
regions, and circumstellar disks.
  Results. The photodissociation rate in the unattenuated interstellar
radiation field is 2.6e-10 s^-1, 30% higher than currently adopted values.
Increasing the excitation temperature or the Doppler width can reduce the
photodissociation rates and the isotopic selectivity by as much as a factor of
three for temperatures above 100 K. The model reproduces column densities
observed towards diffuse clouds and PDRs, and it offers an explanation for both
the enhanced and the reduced N(12CO)/N(13CO) ratios seen in diffuse clouds. The
photodissociation of C17O and 13C17O shows almost exactly the same depth
dependence as that of C18O and 13C18O, respectively, so 17O and 18O are equally
fractionated with respect to 16O. This supports the recent hypothesis that CO
photodissociation in the solar nebula is responsible for the anomalous 17O and
18O abundances in meteorites.
