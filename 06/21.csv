number of these offer mechanisms for other users to evaluate these opinions; a
canonical example is Amazon.com, where reviews come with annotations like ""26
of 32 people found the following review helpful."" Opinion evaluation appears in
many off-line settings as well, including market research and political
campaigns. Reasoning about the evaluation of an opinion is fundamentally
different from reasoning about the opinion itself: rather than asking, ""What
did Y think of X?"", we are asking, ""What did Z think of Y's opinion of X?"" Here
we develop a framework for analyzing and modeling opinion evaluation, using a
large-scale collection of Amazon book reviews as a dataset. We find that the
perceived helpfulness of a review depends not just on its content but also but
also in subtle ways on how the expressed evaluation relates to other
evaluations of the same product. As part of our approach, we develop novel
methods that take advantage of the phenomenon of review ""plagiarism"" to control
for the effects of text in opinion evaluation, and we provide a simple and
natural mathematical model consistent with our findings. Our analysis also
allows us to distinguish among the predictions of competing theories from
sociology and social psychology, and to discover unexpected differences in the
collective opinion-evaluation behavior of user populations from different

order theories. It is based on the well-founded semantics of normal logic
programs and inspired by ideas of Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) and
constructive negation for logic programs. Hybrid rules are normal clauses
extended with constraints in the bodies; constraints are certain formulae in
the language of the external theory. A hybrid program is a pair of a set of
hybrid rules and an external theory. Instances of the framework are obtained by
specifying the class of external theories, and the class of constraints. An
example instance is integration of (non-disjunctive) Datalog with ontologies
formalized as description logics.
  The paper defines a declarative semantics of hybrid programs and a
goal-driven formal operational semantics. The latter can be seen as a
generalization of SLS-resolution. It provides a basis for hybrid
implementations combining Prolog with constraint solvers. Soundness of the
operational semantics is proven. Sufficient conditions for decidability of the
declarative semantics, and for completeness of the operational semantics are
given.

particular, we use this approach to enumerate rational curves of given degree

tangency to a given line. Another application of the combinatorial approach is
a proof of a conjecture by P. Di Francesco -- C. Itzykson and L. Goettsche that

that d is sufficiently large. Furthermore, the proof provides a method for

show that labeled floor diagrams of genus 0 are equinumerous to labeled trees,

this is impossible due to the mutual absolute continuity of Mat\'ern Gaussian
random fields with different scale and variance (see Zhang \cite{zhang:2004}).
Informally, when $d>4$, we show that one can estimate the coefficient on the
principle irregular term accurately enough to get a consistent estimate of the
coefficient on the second irregular term. These two coefficients can then be
used to separate the scale and variance. We extend our results to the general
problem of estimating a variance and geometric anisotropy for more general
autocovariance functions. Our results illustrate the interaction between the
accuracy of estimation, the smoothness of the random field, the dimension of
the observation space, and the number of increments used for estimation. As a

Dynamical
system formulations of weakly coupled oscillator systems have proven effective

determining the coupling parameters from measurements. Starting from the
dynamic equations of a system of coupled phase oscillators, given by a
nonlinear Langevin equation, we derive the corresponding equilibrium
distribution. This formulation leads us to the maximum entropy distribution
that captures pair-wise phase relationships. To solve the inverse problem for
this distribution, we derive a closed form solution for estimating the phase
coupling parameters from observed phase statistics. Through simulations, we
show that the algorithm performs well in high dimensions (d=100) and in cases
with limited data (as few as 100 samples per dimension). Because the
distribution serves as the unique maximum entropy solution for pairwise phase
statistics, the distribution and estimation technique can be broadly applied to
phase coupling estimation in any system of phase oscillators.

integration (TDI) along a reversible path that involves an external potential.
A persistent problem in this method is that a significant hysteresis is
observed due to differences in the center of mass position of the crystal phase
in the presence and absence of the external potential. To alleviate this
hysteresis, a constraint on the translational degrees of freedom of the crystal
phase is imposed along the path and subsequently a correction term is added to
the free energy to account for such a constraint. In this work, we propose a
new methodology termed as error-biased Bennett Acceptance ratio (EBAR) method
that effectively solves this problem without the need to impose any constraint.
This method is simple to implement as it does not require any modification to
the path or to the simulation code. We show the applicability of this method in
the computation of crystal-melt interfacial energy by cleaving wall method [J.

to the inputs of the LTI system. Focusing on the case where the input symbols
are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d)., it is shown that the two
channels (input- and output-erasure) are equivalent. Furthermore, assuming that
the LTI system consists of a two-tap finite impulse response (FIR) filter, and
using simple properties of tri-diagonal matrices, an achievable rate expression
is presented in the form of an infinite sum. The results are then used to study
the benefits of joint multicell processing (MCP) over single-cell processing
(SCP) in a simple linear cellular uplink, where each mobile terminal is
received by only the two nearby base-stations (BSs). Specifically, the analysis
accounts for ergodic shadowing that simultaneously blocks the mobile terminal
(MT) signal from being received by the two BS. It is shown that the resulting
ergodic per-cell capacity with optimal MCP is equivalent to that of the two-tap
input-erasure channel. Finally, the same cellular uplink is addressed by
accounting for dynamic user activity, which is modelled by assuming that each
MT is randomly selected to be active or to remain silent throughout the whole
transmission block. For this alternative model, a similar equivalence results
to the input-erasure channel are reported.

$\tau$ occurring in glass-forming liquids on lowering the temperature must be
due to the thermally activated rearrangement of correlated regions of growing
size. Even though measuring the size of these regions has defied scientists for
a while, there is indeed recent evidence of a growing correlation length $\xi$
in glass-formers. If we use Arrhenius law and make the mild assumption that the
free-energy barrier to rearrangement scales as some power $\psi$ of the size of
the correlated regions, we obtain a relationship between time and length,
$T\log\tau \sim \xi^\psi$. According to both the Adam-Gibbs and the Random
First Order theory the correlation length grows as $\xi \sim
(T-T_k)^{-1/(d-\theta)}$, even though the two theories disagree on the value of
$\theta$. Therefore, the super-Arrhenius growth of the relaxation time with the
temperature is regulated by the two exponents $\psi$ and $\theta$ through the
relationship $T\log\tau \sim (T-T_k)^{-\psi/(d-\theta)}$. Despite a few
theoretical speculations, up to now there has been no experimental
determination of these two exponents. Here we measure them numerically in a
model glass-former, finding $\psi=1$ and $\theta=2$. Surprisingly, even though
the values we found disagree with most previous theoretical suggestions, they
give back the well-known VFT law for the relaxation time, $T\log\tau \sim
(T-T_k)^{-1}$.

the basis for our examples, but our analysis and conclusions apply to any
intercalation material. We describe two general mechanisms for the suppression
of phase separation in nano-particles: (i) a classical bulk effect, predicted
by the Cahn-Hilliard equation, in which the diffuse phase boundary becomes
confined by the particle geometry; and (ii) a novel surface effect, predicted
by chemical-potential-dependent reaction kinetics, in which
insertion/extraction reactions stabilize composition gradients near surfaces in
equilibrium with the local environment. Composition-dependent surface energy
and (especially) elastic strain can contribute to these effects but are not
required to predict decreased spinodal and miscibility gaps at the nano-scale.
