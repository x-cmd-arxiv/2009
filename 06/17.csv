significantly reject the official results unless the five polls favouring

any supernova hitherto observed by its faint and rapidly fading light curve,
prominent calcium lines in late-phase spectra and lack of any mark of recent

explained by a helium detonation in a thin surface layer of an accreting white
dwarf (Perets et al. 2010). Here we report on observations of SN 2005cz
appeared in an elliptical galaxy, whose observed properties resemble those of
SN 2005E in that it is helium-rich and unusually faint, fades rapidly, shows
much weaker oxygen emission lines than those of calcium in the well-evolved
spectrum. We argue that these properties are best explained by a core-collapse
supernova at the low-mass end ($8-12 M_{\odot}$) of the range of massive stars
that explode (Smartt 2009). Such a low mass progenitor had lost its
hydrogen-rich envelope through binary interaction, having very thin oxygen-rich
and silicon-rich layers above the collapsing core, thus ejecting a very small
amount of radioactive $^{56}$Ni and oxygen. Although the host galaxy NGC 4589
is an elliptical, some studies have revealed evidence of recent star-formation
activity (Zhang et al. 2008), consistent with the core-collapse scenario.

related to Kondo physics. While renormalization group and Bethe Anzats
solutions have provided detailed information about the thermodynamics of
magnetic impurities, they are insufficient to study the effect on the
surrounding electrons, i.e., the spatial range of the correlations created by
the Kondo effect between the localized magnetic moment and the conduction
electrons. The objective of this work is to present a quantitative way of
measuring the extension of these correlations by studying their effect directly
on the local density of states (LDOS) at arbitrary distances from the impurity.
The numerical techniques used, the Embedded Cluster Approximation, the Finite U
Slave Bosons, and Numerical Renormalization Group, calculate the Green
functions in real space. With this information, one can calculate how the local
density of states away from the impurity is modified by its presence, below and
above the Kondo temperature, and then estimate the range of the disturbances in
the non-interacting Fermi sea due to the Kondo effect, and how it changes with
the Kondo temperature $T_{\rm K}$. The results obtained agree with results
obtained through spin-spin correlations, showing that the LDOS captures the
phenomenology of the Kondo cloud as well. To the best of our knowledge, it is
the first time that the LDOS is used to estimate the extension of the Kondo
cloud.

particular, the evolution of low-energy excitations with temperature is
analyzed, including the modification of pygmy structures. Both for the monopole

strength appears at low energies because of thermal unblocking of

strength around 10 MeV excitation energy is predicted in $^{60,62}$Ni, where no
low-energy excitations occur at zero temperature. The principal effect of
finite temperature on low-energy strength that is already present at zero

structure to even lower energy and the appearance of states that correspond to
thermally unblocked transitions.

emissions as indicators of star formation rates (SFR). For the first time, we
present this study for a relatively large number of $^{12}$CO transitions (12)
as well as over a large interval in redshift (from z$\sim$0 to z$\sim$6). For
the nearby sources (D$\leq$10 Mpc), we have used homogeneous sample of
$^{12}$CO data provided by Bayet et al. (2004, 2006), mixing observational and
modelled line intensities. For higher-z sources (z $\geq$ 1), we have collected
$^{12}$CO observations from various papers and have completed the data set of
line intensities with model predictions which we also present in this paper.
Finally, for increasing the statistics, we have included recent $^{12}$CO(1-0)
and $^{12}$CO(3-2) observations of intermediate-z sources. Linear regressions
have been calculated for identifying the tightest SFR-$^{12}$CO line luminosity
relationships. We show that the \emph{total} $^{12}$CO, the $^{12}$CO(5-4), the
$^{12}$CO(6-5) and the $^{12}$CO(7-6) luminosities are the best indicators of
SFR (as measured by the far-infrared luminosity). Comparisons with theoretical
approaches from Krumholz and Thompson (2007) and Narayanan et al. (2008) are
also performed in this paper. Although in general agreement, the predictions
made by these authors and the observational results we present here show small
and interesting discrepancies. In particular, the slope of the linear
regressions, for J$_{upper}\geq$ 4 $^{12}$CO lines are not similar between
theoretical studies and observations. On one hand, a larger high-J $^{12}$CO
data set of observations might help to better agree with models, increasing the
statistics. On the other hand, theoretical studies extended to high redshift
sources might also reduce such discrepancies.

  The sample of L3.5 to T5.5 dwarfs spans the range 1800 < Teff < 1000 K, with
an L-T transition (spectral types L7-T4) that lies between 1400 K and 1100K for
dwarfs with typical near-infrared colors; bluer and redder dwarfs can be 100 K
warmer or cooler, respectively, when using infrared spectral types. In this
model analysis, fsed increases rapidly between types T0 and T4, indicating that
increased sedimentation can explain the rapid disappearance of clouds at this
stage of brown dwarf evolution. There is a suggestion that the transition to
dust-free atmospheres happens at lower temperatures for lower gravity dwarfs.

This leads to the opening of a gap and a shift of the molecular orbitals
localized on the doped edge in such a way that the spin gap asymmetry, which
can lead to half-metallicity under certain conditions, is obtained. The
spin-selective behavior of graphene and tunable spin gaps help us to obtain
semiconductor diode-like current-voltage characteristics, where the current
flowing in one direction is preferred over the other. The doping in the middle
of the graphene layer results in an impurity level between the HOMO and LUMO

on the zigzag edges thus decreasing the bandgap and adding unpaired electrons,
and this can also be used to control graphene conductivity.

This construction depends on the choice of a parity function on the strata.
  If X admits a resolution also satisfying a parity condition, then the direct

the multiplicities of the indecomposable summands are encoded in certain

strings. Their current is produced by the condensate of vector W bosons and
typically it can attain billions of Amperes. For large ${\cal I}$ the vortices
show a compact condensate core of size $\sim 1/{\cal I}$, embedded into a
region of size $\sim{\cal I}$ where the electroweak gauge symmetry is
completely restored, followed by a transition zone where the Higgs field
interpolates between the symmetric and broken phases. Outside this zone the
fields are the same as for the ordinary electric wire. An asymptotic
approximation of the large ${\cal I}$ solutions suggests that the current can
be {arbitrarily} large, due to the scale invariance of the vector boson

show by a perturbative analytic calculation and by Monte Carlo simulations that
the probability density function (PDF) of the amplitude $\eta$ exhibits
loglognormal divergence near the maximum possible amplitude $\eta_{m}$, a
behavior that is similar to the one observed earlier for disorder in the linear
gain [A. Peleg et al., Phys. Rev. E {\bf 72}, 027203 (2005)]. We relate the
loglognormal divergence of the amplitude PDF to the super-exponential approach
of $\eta$ to $\eta_{m}$ in the corresponding deterministic model with
linear/nonlinear gain. Furthermore, for solitary waves of the derivative CQNLSE
with weak disorder in the linear gain both the amplitude and the group velocity
$\beta$ become random. We therefore study analytically and by Monte Carlo

$p=\eta/(1-\varepsilon_s\beta/2)$ and $\varepsilon_s$ is the self-steepening

the estimation of all the off-diagonal elements requires an extra clean qubit.

We show for the first time that coronal funnels also exist in the quiet Sun.
The region studied contains several small funnels that originate from network
lanes, expand with height and finally merge into a single wide open-field
region. However, the large blue shifts of the Ne viii line are not generally
associated with funnels. A comparison between the projections of coronal loops
onto the solar x-y-plane and the Ne viii dopplergram indicates that there are
some loops that reveal large Ne viii blue shifts in both legs, and some loops
with upflow in one and downflow in the other leg. Conclusions. Our results
suggest that strong plasma outflow, which can be traced by large Ne viii blue
shift, is not necessarily associated with the solar wind originating in coronal
funnels but appears to be a signature of mass supply to coronal loops. Under
the assumption that the measured Doppler shift of the Ne viii line represents
the real outflow velocity of the neon ions being markers of the proton flow, we
estimate the mass supply rate to coronal loops to be about 10\^{34} s\^{-1}.

Polarization on the largest scales arises mainly from scattering at z<6 when
the universe is fully ionized, making the evidence robust to ionization history
variations at higher redshifts as well. A cutoff in the power spectrum is
limited to C=k_C/10^{-4} Mpc^{-1}<5.2 (95% CL) by polarization, only slightly

epoch following reionization (z ~ 5--6). The rapid decrease with redshift in
the photon mean free path (m.f.p.), combined with the clustering of
increasingly rare ionizing sources, can result in a very inhomogenous ionizing
background during this epoch. We systematically investigate the probability
density functions (PDFs) and power spectra of ionizing flux, by varying several
parameters such as the m.f.p., minimum halo mass capable of hosting stars, and
halo duty cycle. In order to be versatile, we make use of analytic,
semi-numeric and numeric approaches. Our models show that the ionizing
background indeed has sizable fluctuations during this epoch sourced by the
clustering of sources, with the PDFs being a factor of few wide at half of the
maximum likelihood. The distributions also show marked asymmetries, with a
high-value tail set by clustering on small scales, and a shorter low-value tail
which is set by the mean free path. The power spectrum of the ionizing
background is much more sensitive to source properties than the PDF and can be
well-understood analytically with a framework similar to the halo model
(usually used to describe dark matter clustering). Nevertheless, we find that
Lya forest spectra are extremely insensitive to the details of the UVB, despite
marked differences in the PDFs and power spectra of our various ionizing
backgrounds. Assuming a uniform ionizing background only underestimates the
value of the mean ionization rate inferred from the Lya forest by a few
percent. Instead, analysis of the Lya forest is dominated by the uncertainties
in the density field. Thus, our results justify the common assumption of a
uniform ionizing background in Lya forest analysis even during this epoch.

groups simulated at high resolution in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations.
The evolution in the group potential leads, at z=0, to central galaxies that
are massive, gas-poor early-type systems supported by stellar velocity
dispersion resembling either elliptical or S0 galaxies. Their z~2-2.5 main
progenitors are massive M* ~ 3-10 x 10^10 M_sun, star forming (20-60 M_sun/yr)
galaxies which host substantial reservoirs of cold gas (~5 x 10^9 M_sun) in
extended gas disks. Our simulations thus show that star forming galaxies
observed at z~2 are likely the main progenitors of central galaxies in galaxy
groups at z=0. Their central stellar densities stay approximately constant from
z~1.5 down to z=0. Instead, the galaxies grow inside-out, by acquiring a
stellar envelope outside the innermost ~2 kpc. Consequently the density within
the effective radius decreases by up to two orders of magnitude. Both major and
minor mergers contribute to most of the mass accreted outside the effective
radius and thus drive the evolution of the half-mass radii. In one of the three
simulated groups the short central cooling time leads to a dramatic
rejuvenation of the central group galaxy at z<1, affecting its morphology,
kinematics and colors. This episode is eventually terminated by a group-group
merger. Our simulations demonstrate that, in galaxy groups, the interplay
between halo mass assembly, galaxy merging and gas accretion has a substantial
influence on the star formation histories and z=0 morphologies of central
galaxies.[Abridged]

simultaneously from the two H1 neurons located in the lobula plate of the fly
Chrysomya megacephala. The fly views two types of stimuli, corresponding to
rotational and translational displacements. If the reconstructed stimulus is to
be represented by a Volterra series and correlations between spikes are to be
taken into account, first order expansions are insufficient and we have to go
to second order, at least. In this case higher order correlation functions have
to be manipulated, whose size may become prohibitively large. We therefore
develop a Gaussian-like representation for fourth order correlation functions,
which works exceedingly well in the case of the fly. The reconstructions using
this Gaussian-like representation are very similar to the reconstructions using
the experimental correlation functions. The overall contribution to rotational
stimulus reconstruction of the second order kernels - measured by a chi-squared
averaged over the whole experiment - is only about 8% of the first order
contribution. Yet if we introduce an instant-dependent chi-square to measure
the contribution of second order kernels at special events, we observe an up to
100% improvement. As may be expected, for translational stimuli the
reconstructions are rather poor. The Gaussian-like representation could be a
valuable aid in population coding with large number of neurons.

function for the images as well as the corresponding extrapolated magnetic
field at different heights. The HWHM of the autocorrelation function is
considered to be the characteristic size of the feature shown in the

Doppler-shift and non-thermal width at any given altitude. The HWHM of the
intensity image is smaller in the chromosphere than in the TR, where the sizes
of intensity features of lines at different temperatures are almost the same.
But in the upper part of the transition region, the intensity size increases
more strongly with temperature in the coronal hole than in the quiet Sun. We
also studied the height variations of the HWHM of the magnetic field magnitude
B and its component |Bz|, and found they are equal to each other at a certain
height below 40 Mm in the coronal hole. The height variations of the HWHM of
|Bz/B| seem to be consistent with the temperature variations of the intensity
size. Our results suggest that coronal loops are much lower, and magnetic
structures expand through the upper TR and lower corona much more strongly with
height in the coronal hole than in the quiet Sun.

search for radio emission from stars of low optical luminosity. We select a
sample of 112 candidate radio stars in the magnitude range $15<i\lesssim19.1$
and with radio flux $S_{20}\geq1.25$mJy, from about 7000 deg$^2$ of sky. The
selection criteria are positional coincidence within $1\arcsec$, radio and
optical point source morphology, and an SDSS spectrum classified as stellar.
The sample contamination is estimated by random matching to be $108\pm13$,
suggesting that at most a small fraction of the selected candidates are genuine
radio stars. Therefore, we rule out a very rare population of extremely
radio-loud stars: no more than 1.2 of every million stars in the magnitude
range $15<i<19.1$ stars has radio flux $S_{20}\geq1.25$ mJy. We investigate the
optical and radio colors of the sample to find candidates that show the largest
likelihood of being real radio stars. The significant outliers from the stellar
locus, as well as the magnetically active stars, are the best candidates for
follow-up radio observations. We conclude that, while the present wide-area
radio surveys are not sensitive enough to provide homogeneous samples of the
extremely rare radio stars, upcoming surveys which exploit the great
sensitivity of current and planned telescopes do have sufficient sensitivity
and will allow the properties of this class of object to be investigated in

Chinese manuscript (Or.8210/S.3326), discovered in 1907 by the archaeologist
Aurel Stein at the Silk Road town of Dunhuang and now held in the British
Library. Although partially studied by a few Chinese scholars, it has never
been fully displayed and discussed in the Western world. This set of sky maps
(12 hour angle maps in quasi-cylindrical projection and a circumpolar map in
azimuthal projection), displaying the full sky visible from the Northern
hemisphere, is up to now the oldest complete preserved star atlas from any
civilisation. It is also the first known pictorial representation of the
quasi-totality of the Chinese constellations. This paper describes the history
of the physical object - a roll of thin paper drawn with ink. We analyse the
stellar content of each map (1339 stars, 257 asterisms) and the texts
associated with the maps. We establish the precision with which the maps are
drawn (1.5 to 4 degrees for the brightest stars) and examine the type of
projections used. We conclude that precise mathematical methods were used to
produce the atlas. We also discuss the dating of the manuscript and its
possible author and confirm the dates 649-684 (early Tang dynasty) as most
probable based on available evidence. This is at variance with a prior estimate
around +940. Finally we present a brief comparison with later sky maps, both in
China and in Europe.

parameters in across generation and within generation, respectively. We also

attacks by injecting malicious interference. Nowadays, jammers can be portable
devices that transmit intermittently at low power in order to conserve energy.
In this paper, we first conduct extensive experiments on an indoor 802.11
network to assess the ability of two physical layer functions, rate adaptation
and power control, in mitigating jamming. In the presence of a jammer we find
that: (a) the use of popular rate adaptation algorithms can significantly
degrade network performance and, (b) appropriate tuning of the carrier sensing
threshold allows a transmitter to send packets even when being jammed and
enables a receiver capture the desired signal. Based on our findings, we build
ARES, an Anti-jamming REinforcement System, which tunes the parameters of rate
adaptation and power control to improve the performance in the presence of
jammers. ARES ensures that operations under benign conditions are unaffected.
To demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of ARES, we evaluate it in
three wireless testbeds: (a) an 802.11n WLAN with MIMO nodes, (b) an 802.11a/g
mesh network with mobile jammers and (c) an 802.11a WLAN. We observe that ARES
improves the network throughput across all testbeds by up to 150%.

internally disjoint set of trees connecting $S$. Chartrand et al. generalized
the concept of connectivity as follows: The $k$-$connectivity$, denoted by
$\kappa_k(G)$, of $G$ is defined by $\kappa_k(G)=$min$\{\kappa(S)\}$, where the
minimum is taken over all $k$-subsets $S$ of $V(G)$. Thus
$\kappa_2(G)=\kappa(G)$, where $\kappa(G)$ is the connectivity of $G$.

therefore focus on the investigation on $\kappa_3(G)$ in this paper. We study
the relation between the connectivity and the 3-connectivity of a graph. First
we give sharp upper and lower bounds of $\kappa_3(G)$ for general graphs $G$,
and construct two kinds of graphs which attain the upper and lower bound,
respectively. We then show that if $G$ is a connected planar graph, then
$\kappa(G)-1 \leq \kappa_3(G)\leq \kappa(G)$, and give some classes of graphs
which attain the bounds. In the end we show that the problem whether
$\kappa(G)=\kappa_3(G)$ for a planar graph $G$ can be solved in polynomial

8.2. We present a detailed analysis of both the spectral and temporal features
of GRB 090423 observed with Swift/BAT and Fermi/GBM. We find that the T90
observed with BAT in the 15-150 keV band is 13.2 s, corresponding to ~ 1.4 s at
z=8.2. It once again gives rise to an issue whether the progenitors of high-z
GRBs are massive stars or mergers since the discovery of GRB 080913 at z=6.7.
In comparison with T90 distribution in the burst frame of current
redshift-known GRB sample, we find that it is marginally grouped into the long
group (Type II GRBs). The spectrum observed with both BAT and GBM is well
fitted by a power-law with exponential cutoff, which yields an Ep=50.4+/-7.0
keV. The event well satisfies the Amati-relation for the Type II GRBs within
their 3 siggma uncertainty range. Our results indicate that this event would be
produced by the death of a massive star. Based on the Amati-relation, we derive
its distance modulus, which follows the Hubble diagram of the concordance
cosmology model at a redshift of ~8.2.

mechanical systems by corresponding infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian systems.
This approach is based upon the following structure: for any non-conservative
classical mechanical system and arbitrary initial conditions, there exists a
conservative system; both systems share one and only one common phase curve;
and, the value of the Hamiltonian of the conservative system is, up to an
additive constant, equal to the total energy of the non-conservative system on
the aforementioned phase curve, the constant depending on the initial
conditions. We describe in detail this relationship calling the conservative
system ``substitute`` conservative system. By considering the dissipative
mechanical system as a special fluid in a domain $D$ of the phase space, viz. a
collection of particles in this domain, we are prompted to develop this system
as an infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian system of an ideal fluid. By comparing
the description of the ideal fluid in Lagrangian coordinates, we can consider
the Hamiltonian and the Lagrangian as the respective integrals of the
Hamiltonian and the Lagrangian of the substitute conservative system over the
initial value space and define a new Poisson bracket to express the equations
of motion in Hamiltonian form. The advantage of the approach is that the value
of the canonical momentum density $\pi$ is identical with that of the
mechanical momentum $m\dot{q}$ and the value of canonical coordinate $q$ is
identical with that of the coordinate of the dissipative mechanical system.
Therefore we need not to decouple the Newtonian equations of motion into
several one-dimensional ordinary differential equations.

particle size favors the flux of reactants to the catalyst particles, which
increases the turnover frequency (TOF). The reactant flux towards the support
becomes dominant when the ratio of diffusion lengths in the catalyst and in the
support exceeds a critical value. A peak in the TOF is obtained for
temperature-dependent rates if desorption energy in the support (Ed) exceeds
those of diffusion (ED) and reaction (Er). Significant dependence on particle
size is observed when the gaps between those energies are small, with small
particles giving higher TOF. Slow reactions (Er > Ed) give TOF monotonically
increasing with temperature, with higher reactant losses in small particles.
The scaling concepts can be extended to interpret experimental data and results

However, $b(a)$ is quite model independent. Recently, we obtained the exact

behavior of the growth factor obtained numerically. However, the exact solution
is simple and useful for the extension to other models including modified
gravity theories. Furthermore, it guides to the fact that the growth index
parameter depends on both models $\omega_{\de}$ and $\Omega_{m}^{0}$ and thus
we need to be careful for applying the fitting formulae to the general models

simulations predict a cosmic web of extended emission and filamentary
structures. We study the distribution of neutral hydrogen and its 21cm emission
properties in a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, to gain more insights
into the distribution of HI below NHI ~ 10^19 cm-2. Such Lyman Limit systems
are expected to trace out the cosmic web, and are relatively unexplored.
Beginning with a 32 h^-1 Mpc simulation, we extract the neutral hydrogen
component by determining the neutral fraction, including a post-processed
correction for self-shielding based on the thermal pressure. We take into
account molecular hydrogen, assuming an average density ratio Omega_H2 /
Omega_HI = 0.3 at z = 0. The statistical properties of the HI emission are
compared with observations, to assess the reliability of the simulation. The
simulated HI distribution robustly describes the full column density range
between NHI ~ 10^14 and NHI ~ 10^21 cm-2 and agrees very well with available
measurements from observations. Furthermore there is good correspondence in the
statistics when looking at the two-point correlation function and the HI mass
function. The reconstructed maps are used to simulate observations of existing
and future telescopes by adding noise and taking account of the sensitivity of
the telescopes. The general agreement in statistical properties of HI suggests
that neutral hydrogen as modeled in this hydrodynamic simulation is a fair

changes in the resolution of input images. Building the metric requires a prior

`first order smoothing approximation'. However it is non perturbative in the
shear strength. We first derive an integro-differential equation for the
evolution of the mean magnetic field, by systematic use of the shearing
coordinate transformation and the Galilean invariance of the linear shear flow.
We show that, for non helical turbulence, the time evolution of the cross-shear
components of the mean field do not depend on any other components excepting
themselves; this is valid for any Galilean-invariant velocity field,
independent of its dynamics. Hence, to all orders in the shear parameter, there
is no shear-current type effect for non helical turbulence in a linear shear
flow, in quasilinear theory in the limit of zero resistivity. We then develop a
systematic approximation of the integro-differential equation for the case when
the mean magnetic field varies slowly compared to the turbulence correlation
time. For non-helical turbulence, the resulting partial differential equations
can again be solved by making a shearing coordinate transformation in Fourier
space. The resulting solutions are in the form of shearing waves, labeled by
the wavenumber in the sheared coordinates. These shearing waves can grow at
early and intermediate times but are expected to decay in the long time limit.

development of extensive air shower cascades. Therefore the interpretation of
air shower data depends critically on hadronic interaction models that
extrapolate the cross section from accelerator measurements to the highest
cosmic ray energies. We discuss how extreme scenarios of cross section
extrapolations can affect the interpretation of air shower data. We find that
the theoretical uncertainty of the extrapolated proton-air cross section at
ultra-high energies is much larger than suggested by the existing spread of
available Monte Carlo model predictions. The impact on the depth of the shower
maximum is demonstrated.

significant of these results demonstrates the existence of a phase transition
threshold, below which eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors of the sample

develop a decision-theoretic rank estimation framework that leads to a simple

the Planck and Herschel satellites and provide new constraints on the nature of
interstellar dust. The microwave anomalous emission, proposed to be due to
spinning PAHs, should help to better define these species. Moreover,
understanding the fluctuations of the anomalous emission over the sky is
crucial for CMB studies. We focus on the long wavelength emission of
interstellar PAHs in their rovibrational and rotational transitions. The PAH
emission spectrum from the IR to the microwave range is presented and compared
to anomalous emission observations. To model their long wavelength emission, we
treat PAHs as isolated systems and follow consistently their IR and rotational
emissions. We consider several interstellar phases and discuss how the
anomalous emission may constrain their size distribution. Our model of PAH
emission accounts for the mid-IR spectra of the diffuse interstellar medium and
of the Orion Bar. For lambda<3mm the PAH IR emission does not scale any more
with the radiation field intensity (Go) unlike the mid-IR part of the spectrum.
This emission represents less than 10% of the total dust emission at 100 GHz.
We find the broadband emissivity of spinning PAHs per carbon atom to be rather
constant for Go<100 and nH<100cm-3. Observations of anomalous emission in the
Perseus molecular cloud are explained by our model of spinning PAH emission
with a standard abundance, supporting PAHs as the origin of the anomalous
emission. The behaviour of the spinning dust emissivity with Go provides a
clear test that can be tested against observations of anomalous and dust mid-IR
emissions. Comparison of these emissions will provide constraints on the size
and/or electric dipole moment of interstellar PAHs.

class of high-Tc iron pnictide composite wires, such as LaFeAsO1-xFx,
SmFeAsO1-xFx and Sr1-xKxFeAs, has been fabricated by the in situ PIT technique
using Fe, Ta and Nb tubes. Microscopy and x-ray analysis show that the
superconducting core is continuous, and retains phase composition after wire
drawing and heat treatment. Furthermore, the wires exhibit a very weak Jc-field
dependence behavior even at high temperatures. The upper critical field Hc2(0)
value can exceed 100 T, surpassing those of MgB2 and all the low temperature
superconductors and indicating a strong potential for applications requiring
very high field. These results demonstrate the feasibility of producing
superconducting pnictide composite wire. We also applied the one step PIT
method to synthesize the iron-based bulks, due to its convenience and safety.
In fact, by using this technique, we have successfully discovered
superconductivity at 35 K and 15 K in Eu0.7Na0.3Fe2As2 and SmCoFeAsO compounds,
respectively. These clearly suggest that the one-step PIT technique is unique

frequencies as well as corresponding values of a complex, nonadiabatic

apply the method of simultaneous determination of the spherical harmonic
degree, $\ell$, of excited pulsational mode and the corresponding nonadiabatic
$f$ parameter from combined multicolour photometry and radial velocity data.
Using both the OP and OPAL opacity data, we find a family of seismic models
which reproduce the radial and dipole centroid mode frequencies, as well as the
$f$ parameter associated with the radial mode. Adding the nonadiabatic
parameter to seismic modelling of the B-type main sequence pulsators yields
very strong constraints on stellar opacities. In particular, only with one
source of opacities it is possible to agree the empirical values of $f$ with
their theoretical counterparts. Our results for $\theta$ Oph point
substantially to preference for the OPAL data.

assuming the models to have a particular structure, these resampling penalties
are proved to satisfy a non-asymptotic oracle inequality with leading constant
close to 1. In particular, they are asympotically optimal. Resampling penalties
are used for defining an estimator adapting simultaneously to the smoothness of
the regression function and to the heteroscedasticity of the noise. This is
remarkable because resampling penalties are general-purpose devices, which have
not been built specifically to handle heteroscedastic data. Hence, resampling
penalties naturally adapt to heteroscedasticity. A simulation study shows that
resampling penalties improve on V-fold cross-validation in terms of final
prediction error, in particular when the signal-to-noise ratio is not large.

recurrence might produce non-integral rational numbers. Throughout the '90s,
proofs of integrality were known only for individual special cases. In the

actually polynomials with integer coefficients. However, their proof did not
offer any enumerative interpretation of the Gale-Robinson numbers/polynomials.

spatial covariances of local observables decay exponentially. We then study the
zero dissipation limit and prove that the self-organized critical model is
recovered, both for the stationary measure and for the dynamics. We obtain
rigorous bounds on toppling probabilities and introduce an exponent describing
their scaling at criticality. We rigorously establish the mean-field value of
this exponent for $d > 4$.

In bulk,
electronic conduction in these materials takes place mainly through the $s$ and

$d$-electron bands, where they tend to align. This general picture may change
at the nanoscale because electrons at the surfaces of materials experience
interactions that differ from those in the bulk. Here we show direct evidence
for such changes: electronic transport in atomic-scale contacts of pure
ferromagnets (iron, cobalt and nickel), despite their strong bulk
ferromagnetism, unexpectedly reveal Kondo physics, that is, the screening of
local magnetic moments by the conduction electrons below a characteristic
temperature. The Kondo effect creates a sharp resonance at the Fermi energy,
affecting the electrical properties of the system;this appears as a Fano-Kondo
resonance in the conductance characteristics as observed in other artificial
nanostructures. The study of hundreds of contacts shows material-dependent
lognormal distributions of the resonance width that arise naturally from Kondo
theory. These resonances broaden and disappear with increasing temperature,
also as in standard Kondo systems. Our observations, supported by calculations,
imply that coordination changes can significantly modify magnetism at the
nanoscale. Therefore, in addition to standard micromagnetic physics, strong
electronic correlations along with atomic-scale geometry need to be considered

fundamental constraints on the chemical evolution of this important Galaxy
component. However the spread around the mean slope is, at fixed Galactocentric
distance, larger than estimated uncertainties. Methods: To provide quantitative
constraints on these trends we adopted iron abundances for 265 classical
Cepheids (more than 50% of the currently known sample) based either on
high-resolution spectra or on photometric metallicity indices. Homogeneous
distances were estimated using near-infrared Period-Luminosity relations. The
sample covers the four disk quadrants and their Galactocentric distances range
from ~5 to ~17 kpc. Results: A linear regression over the entire sample
provides an iron gradient of -0.051+/-0.004 dex/kpc. The above slope agrees
quite well, within the errors, with previous estimates based either on Cepheids
or on open clusters covering similar Galactocentric distances. However, once we
split the sample in inner (Rg < 8 kpc) and outer disk Cepheids we found that
the slope (-0.130+/-0.015 dex/kpc) in the former region is ~3 times steeper
than the slope in the latter one (-0.042+/-0.004 dex/kpc). We found that in the
outer disk the radial distribution of metal-poor (MP, [Fe/H]<-0.02 dex) and
metal-rich (MR) Cepheids across the four disk quadrants does not show a clear
trend when moving from the innermost to the external disk regions. We also
found that the relative fractions of MP and MR Cepheids in the 1st and in the
3rd quadrant differ at 8 sigma (MP) and 15 sigma (MR) level.

show that for higher-order conservation laws to exist, it is necessary that $f$
satisfies a linear second order ODE. In this case, an at most real
two--dimensional space of new conservation laws in normal form appears at each
even prolongation. When $f_{uu}=\beta f$ this upper bound is attained and the

  Value of information (VOI) is a well-known scheme for selecting measurements,

estimates. In the selection problem, myopic VOI frequently badly underestimates
the value of information, leading to inferior sensing plans. We relax the
strict myopic assumption into a scheme we term semi-myopic, providing a
spectrum of methods that can improve the performance of sensing plans. In
particular, we propose the efficiently computable method of ``blinkered'' VOI,

considered, without reactant input during the operation. The models show
transitions between a phase with continuous decay of reactant concentration and
a phase with asymptotic non-zero reactant concentration and complete poisoning
of the catalyst. The transition boundary depends on the initial reactant and
catalyst concentrations and on the poisoning probability. The critical system
behaves as in the two-species annihilation reaction, with reactant
concentration decaying as t^{-1/4} and the catalytic sites playing the role of
the second species. In the unimolecular reaction, a significant crossover to
the asymptotic scaling is observed even when one of those parameters is 10% far
from criticality. Consequently, an effective power-law decay of concentration
may persist up to long times and lead to an apparent change in the reaction
kinetics. In the bimolecular single-species reaction, the critical scaling is
followed by a two-dimensional rapid decay, thus two crossovers are found.

the supernova ejecta and the radiative transfer problem is solved
self-consistently, enforcing the constraint of energy conservation in the
co-moving frame. Assuming a photoionisation dominated plasma, the equations of
ionisation equilibrium are solved together with the thermal balance equation
adopting an approximate treatment of excitation. Since we implement a fully
general treatment of line formation, there are no free parameters to adjust.
Thus a direct comparison between synthetic spectra and light curves, calculated
from hydrodynamic explosion models, and observations is feasible. The code is
applied to the well known W7 explosion model and the results tested against
other studies. Finally the effect of asymmetric ejecta on broad band light
curves and spectra is illustrated using an elliptical toy model.

highly-nucleated ULIRGs presented in Paper I. Our analysis indicates that the
fraction of QSOs with elliptical hosts is higher among QSOs with undetected
far-infrared (FIR) emission, small infrared excess, and luminous hosts. The
hosts of FIR-faint QSOs show a tendency to have less pronounced merger-induced
morphological anomalies and larger QSO-to-host luminosity ratios on average
than the hosts of FIR-bright QSOs, consistent with late-merger evolution from
FIR-bright to FIR-faint QSOs. The spheroid sizes and total host luminosities of
the radio-quiet PG QSOs in our sample are statistically indistinguishable from
the ULIRG hosts presented in Paper I, while those of radio-loud PG QSOs are
systematically larger and more luminous. ULIRGs and PG QSOs with elliptical
hosts fall near, but not exactly on, the fundamental plane of inactive
spheroids. We confirm the systematic trend noted in Paper I for objects with
small (< 2 kpc) spheroids to be up to ~1 mag. brighter than inactive spheroids.
The host colors and wavelength dependence of their sizes support the idea that
these deviations are due at least in part to non-nuclear star formation.
However, the amplitudes of these deviations does not depend on host R-H colors.
Taken at face value (i.e., no correction for extinction or the presence of a
young stellar population), the H-band spheroid-host luminosities imply BH
masses ~5 -- 200 x 10^7 M_sun and sub-Eddington mass accretion rates for both
QSOs and ULIRGs. These results are compared with published BH mass estimates

of cometary material shows that a significant fraction of the amorphous
silicates was transformed into crystalline form during the early evolution of
the protosolar nebula. How and when this transformation happened has been
controversial, with the main options being heating by the young Sun or shock
heating. Here we report mid-infrared features in the outburst spectrum of the
young solar-like star EX Lupi that were not present in quiescence. We attribute
them to crystalline forsterite; the crystals were produced via thermal
annealing in the surface layer of the inner disk by heat from the outburst, a
process that has hitherto not been considered. The observed lack of cold
crystals excludes shock heating at larger radii.

whether it is the circumstellar disk structure which makes EX Lup an atypical

characterization of the quiescent disk is intended to serve as a reference to
study the physical changes related to one of EX Lupi's strongest known

spectroscopic observations including ground-based, IRAS, ISO and Spitzer data.
After constructing the optical-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED), we
compared it with the typical SEDs of other young stellar objects and modeled it
using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code RADMC. A mineralogical
decomposition of the 10 micron silicate emission feature and also the
description of the optical and near-infrared spectra were performed. The SED is
in general similar to that of a typical T Tauri star, though above 7 micron EX
Lup emits higher flux. The quiescent phase data suggest low level variability
in the optical-mid-infrared domain. Integrating the optical and infrared fluxes
we derived a bolometric luminosity of 0.7 L_Sun. The 10 micron silicate profile
could be fitted by a mixture consisting of amorphous silicates, no crystalline

mixed valent regime of non-integral dot charge, are found to consist of
continuous lines of Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions, separated by first order
level-crossing transitions at high symmetry points. A `Friedel-Luttinger sum

theorem to the USC phase (a singular Fermi liquid), is used to obtain a general
result for the T=0 zero-bias conductance, expressed solely in terms of the dot

a Kondo resonance, or antiresonance, as the transition is approached from the

mass hierarchy with a relatively large theta_(13), we show that survival
probabilities of electron type neutrinos and antineutrinos seen from the
rotational axis of the MHD supernovae (i.e., polar direction), can be
significantly different from those along the equatorial direction. The event
numbers of electron type antineutrinos observed from the polar direction are
predicted to show steepest decrease, reflecting the passage of the
magneto-driven shock to the so-called high-resonance regions. Furthermore we
point out that such a shock effect, depending on the original neutrino spectra,
appears also for the low-resonance regions, which leads to a noticeable
decrease in the electron type neutrino signals. This reflects a unique nature
of the magnetic explosion featuring a very early shock-arrival to the resonance
regions, which is in sharp contrast to the neutrino-driven delayed supernova
models. Our results suggest that the two features in the electron type

temperatures ($T \geq 40$ mK) and high magnetic fields ($B \leq 14$ T), have
been performed on a two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnet Cu(tn)Cl$_{2}$ (tn =
C$_{3}$H$_{10}$N$_{2}$). The compound represents an $S = 1/2$ spatially
anisotropic triangular magnet realized by a square lattice with
nearest-neighbor ($J/k_{B} = 3$ K), frustrating next-nearest-neighbor ($0 <
J^{\prime}/J < 0.6$), and interlayer ($|J^{\prime \prime}/J| \approx 10^{-3}$)
interactions. The absence of long-range magnetic order down to $T = $ 60 mK in
$B = 0$ and the $T^{2}$ behavior of the specific heat for $T \leq 0.4$ K and $B
\geq 0$ are considered evidence of high degree of 2D magnetic order. In fields
lower than the saturation field, $B_{\text{sat}} = 6.6$ T, a specific heat
anomaly, appearing near 0.8 K, is ascribed to bound vortex-antivortex pairs
stabilized by the applied magnetic field. The resulting magnetic phase diagram
is remarkably consistent with the one predicted for the ideal square lattice,
except that $B_{\text{sat}}$ is shifted to values lower than expected.
Potential explanations for this observation, as well as the possibility of a
Berezinski-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition in a spatially
anisotropic triangular magnet with the N\'{e}el ground state, are discussed.

illustrates the complexity of the ISM of the GRB host galaxy at z = 1.51 which
has at least four components in the main absorption system. We detect strong
FeII, SiII, and NiII excited absorption lines associated with the bluemost
component only. In addition to the host galaxy, at least two more absorbers
lying along the line of sight to the afterglow have been detected in the
redshift range 0.8 < z < 1.1, each exhibiting MgII absorption. For the bluemost
component in the host galaxy, we derive information about its distance from the
site of the GRB explosion. We do so by assuming that the excited absorption
lines are produced by indirect UV pumping, and compare the data with a time
dependent photo-excitation code. The distance of this component is found to be
280+40-50 pc, which is lower than found for other GRBs (1 - 6 kpc). We identify
two additional MgII absorbers, one of them with a rest frame equivalent width
larger than 1A. The distance between the GRB and the absorber measured in this
paper confirms that the power of the GRB radiation can influence the conditions
of the interstellar medium up to a distance of at least several hundred pc. For
the intervening absorbers, we confirm the trend that on average one strong

analyze a multi-epoch, high resolution spectroscopic observations (R=40000,
corresponding to 7.5 km/s) of the optical afterglow of GRB080319B (z=0.937),
taken with UVES at the VLT. Thanks to the rapid response mode (RRM), we
observed the afterglow just 8m:30s after the GRB onset when the magnitude was R
~ 12. This allowed us to obtain the best signal-to-noise, high resolution
spectrum of a GRB afterglow ever (S/N per resolution element ~ 50). Two further
RRM and target of opportunity observations were obtained starting 1.0 and 2.4
hours after the event, respectively. Four MgII absorption systems lying along
the line of sight to the afterglow have been detected in the redshift range 0.5
< z < 0.8, most of them showing a complex structure featuring several
components. Absorptions due to FeII, MgI and MnII are also present; they appear
in four, two and one intervening absorbers, respectively. One out of four
systems show a MgII2796 rest frame equivalent width larger than 1A. This
confirms the excess of strong MgII absorbers compared to quasars, with dn/dz =
0.9, ~ 4 times larger than the one observed along quasar lines of sight. In
addition, the analysis of multi-epoch, high-resolution spectra allowed us to
exclude a significant variability in the column density of the single
components of each absorber. Combining this result with estimates of the size
of the emitting region, we can reject the hypothesis that the difference
between GRB and QSO MgII absorbers is due to a different size of the emitting
regions.

  Networking, special issue on Wireless Physical Security, 2009",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we study the frequency-selective broadcast channel with
confidential messages (BCC) in which the transmitter sends a confidential
message to receiver 1 and a common message to receivers 1 and 2. In the case of
a block transmission of N symbols followed by a guard interval of L symbols,
the frequency-selective channel can be modeled as a N * (N+L) Toeplitz matrix.
For this special type of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels, we
propose a practical Vandermonde precoding that consists of projecting the
confidential messages in the null space of the channel seen by receiver 2 while
superposing the common message. For this scheme, we provide the achievable rate
region, i.e. the rate-tuple of the common and confidential messages, and
characterize the optimal covariance inputs for some special cases of interest.
It is proved that the proposed scheme achieves the optimal degree of freedom
(d.o.f) region. More specifically, it enables to send l <= L confidential
messages and N-l common messages simultaneously over a block of N+L symbols.
Interestingly, the proposed scheme can be applied to secured multiuser
scenarios such as the K+1-user frequency-selective BCC with K confidential
messages and the two-user frequency-selective BCC with two confidential
messages. For each scenario, we provide the achievable secrecy degree of
freedom (s.d.o.f.) region of the corresponding frequency-selective BCC and
prove the optimality of the Vandermonde precoding. One of the appealing
features of the proposed scheme is that it does not require any specific
secrecy encoding technique but can be applied on top of any existing powerful
encoding schemes.

faster, easier, and cheaper than ever before. This, it has been argued, has
decreased the importance of geographic proximity in social interactions,
transforming our world into a global village with a borderless society. We
argue for the opposite: while technology has undoubtedly increased the overall
level of communication, this increase has been most pronounced for local social
ties. We show that the volume of electronic communications is inversely
proportional to geographic distance, following a Power Law. We directly study
the importance of physical proximity in social interactions by analyzing the
spatial dissemination of new baby names. Counter-intuitively, and in line with
the above argument, the importance of geographic proximity has dramatically
increased with the internet revolution.

the size difference of the particles. We experimentally investigate sheared
bidisperse granular materials as a function of the size ratio of the two
species, and find that the mixing rate at low confining pressure behaves as
expected from percolation-based arguments. However, we also observe an
anomalous effect for the re-segregation rates, wherein particles of both
dissimilar and similar sizes segregate more slowly than intermediate particle
size ratios. Combined with the fact that increasing the confining pressure
significantly suppresses both mixing and segregation rates of particles of
dissimilar size, we propose that the anomalous behavior may be attributed to a
species-dependent distribution of forces within the system.
