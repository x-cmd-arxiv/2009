Groups 15 (2010), no. 3, 517-549",,,"math.RT math.RA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","  Global and local Weyl Modules were introduced via generators and relations in
the context of affine Lie algebras in a work by the first author and Pressley
and were motivated by representations of quantum affine algebras. A more
general case was considered by Feigin and Loktev by replacing the polynomial
ring with the coordinate ring of an algebraic variety. We show that there is a
natural definition of the local and global modules via homological properties.
This characterization allows us to define the Weyl functor from the category of
left modules of a commutative algebra to the category of modules for a simple
Lie algebra. As an application we are able to understand the relationships of
these functors to tensor products, generalizing previous results. Finally an
analysis of the fundamental Weyl modules proves that the functors are not left
exact in general, even for coordinate rings of affine varieties.

coupled scalars in supergravity, and use these to compute the CFT amplitude for
emission from a state carrying a single excitation. Using spectral flow we
relate this process to one where we have emission from a highly excited initial

of the superconformal algebra, even when the projectors are not integrable, so
one is able to define a superconformal theory not associated with a particular

non-geometric examples that arise in the T-duality inspired doubled

not depend on the existence of isometries, or invariant structures beyond

clusters act as ""antennas"" to amplify small changes in ligand concentration.
Interestingly, chemoreceptors cluster at multiple length scales. At the
smallest scale, receptors form dimers, which assemble into stable timers of
dimers. At a large scale, trimers form large polar clusters composed of
thousands of receptors. Although much is known about the signaling properties
emerging from receptor clusters, it is unknown how receptors localize at the
cell poles and what the cluster-size determining factors are. Here, we present
a model of polar receptor clustering based on coupled trimers of dimers, where
cluster size is determined as a minimum of the cluster-membrane free energy.
This energy has contributions from the cluster-membrane elastic energy,
penalizing large clusters due to their high intrinsic curvature, and
receptor-receptor coupling favoring large clusters. We find that the reduced
cluster-membrane curvature mismatch at the curved cell poles leads to large and
robust polar clusters in line with experimental observation, while lateral
clusters are efficiently suppressed.

low-luminosity object in which such a high velocity outflow is not expected;
therefore, it is an outlier on the M_V/V_max relationship. Template spectral
fitting yielded apparent ionic columns, and a Cloudy analysis showed that the
presence of PV requires a high ionization parameter log(U) >= 0 and high column
density log(N_H) >= 23 assuming solar abundances and a nominal SED for
low-luminosity NLS1s with alpha_ox=-1.28. A recent long Swift observation
revealed the first hard X-ray detection and an intrinsic (unabsorbed) alpha_ox
~ -1.9$. Using this SED in our analysis yielded lower column density
constraints (log(N_H) >= 22.2 for Z=1, or log(N_H) >= 21.6 if Z=5). The X-ray
weak continuum, combined with X-ray absorption consistent with the UV lines,
provides the best explanation for the observed Swift X-ray spectrum. The large
column densities and velocities implied by the UV data in any of these
scenarios could be problematic for radiative acceleration. We also point out
that since the observed PV absorption can be explained by lower total column
densities using an intrinsically X-ray weak spectrum, we might expect to find
PV absorption preferentially more often (or stronger) in quasars that are
intrinsically X-ray weak.

recently introduced semantical platform and ambitious program for redeveloping
logic as a formal theory of computability, as opposed to the formal theory of
truth that logic has more traditionally been. Its expressions represent
interactive computational tasks seen as games played by a machine against the
environment, and ""truth"" is understood as existence of an algorithmic winning
strategy. With logical operators standing for operations on games, the
formalism of CoL is open-ended, and has already undergone series of extensions.
This article extends the expressive power of CoL in a qualitatively new way,
generalizing formulas (to which the earlier languages of CoL were limited) to
circuit-style structures termed cirquents. The latter, unlike formulas, are
able to account for subgame/subtask sharing between different parts of the
overall game/task. Among the many advantages offered by this ability is that it
allows us to capture, refine and generalize the well known
independence-friendly logic which, after the present leap forward, naturally
becomes a conservative fragment of CoL, just as classical logic had been known
to be a conservative fragment of the formula-based version of CoL. Technically,
this paper is self-contained, and can be read without any prior familiarity

large number of fascinating geometric properties and to be closely related, in
the context of general relativity, to a variety of physically significant
affects. It is the purpose of this paper to develop these issues and find
applications in GR. The applications center around the problem of extracting
interior physical properties of an asymptotically flat space-time directly from
the asymptotic gravitational (and Maxwell) field itself in analogy with the
determination of total charge by an integral over the Maxwell field at infinity
or the identification of the interior mass (and its loss) by (Bondi's)
integrals of the Weyl tensor, also at infinity. More specifically we will see
that the asymptotically shear-free congruences lead us to an asymptotic
definition of the center-of-mass and its equations of motion. This includes a
kinematic meaning, in terms of the center of mass motion, for the Bondi
three-momentum. In addition, we obtain insights into intrinsic spin and, in
general, angular momentum, including an angular momentum conservation law with
well-defined flux terms. When a Maxwell field is present the asymptotically
shear-free congruences allow us to determine/define at infinity a
center-of-charge world-line and intrinsic magnetic dipole moment.

emission from star-forming regions, the MAPPINGSIII photoionization code is
used. The high wavelength resolution (~ 1000 wavelengths) is made possible by
the polychromatic Monte-Carlo algorithm employed by Sunrise. From the 2-D
spectral energy distributions, images in any filter bands or integrated galaxy
SEDs can be created. Using a suite of hydrodynamic simulations of disc
galaxies, the output broad-band images and spectral energy distributions are
compared with observed galaxies from the multiwavelength SINGS and SLUGS galaxy
surveys. Overall, the output spectral energy distributions show a good match
with observed galaxies in colours ranging from GALEX far-UV to SCUBA
submillimeter wavelengths. The only possible exception is the 160 micron/850
micron colour, which the simulations underestimate by a factor ""of order 5""
compared to the SINGS sample. However, the simulations here agree with the
SLUGS galaxies, which consistently have significantly larger amounts of cold
dust than the SINGS galaxies. The Sunrise model can be used to generate
simulated observations of arbitrary hydrodynamic galaxy simulations. In this

Hubble constant $H$ such that the vacuum energy is $\epsilon_{vac} \sim H \cdot
m_q\la\bar{q}q\ra /m_{\eta'} \sim (3.6\cdot 10^{-3} \text{eV})^4$, which is

the vacuum energy, because the ghost's properties at very large but finite
distances slightly deviate (as $\sim H / \Lqcd $) from their infinite volume
Minkowski values. Another important prediction of this framework states that
the vacuum energy owes its existence to the asymmetry of the cosmos. Indeed,
this effect is a direct consequence of the embedding of our Universe on a
non-trivial manifold such as a torus with (slightly) different linear sizes.

improved pulsar search algorithms and sustained pulsar timing observations have
so far yielded some 140 pulsars in more than two dozen GCs. The observed
distribution of orbital eccentricity and period of binary radio pulsars in GCs
have imprints of the past interaction between single pulsars and binary systems
or of binary pulsars and single passing non-compact stars. It is seen that GCs
have different groups of pulsars. These may have arisen out of exchange or
merger of a component of the binary with the incoming star or a ""fly-by"" in
which the original binary remains intact but undergoes a change of eccentricity
and orbital period. We consider the genesis of the distribution of pulsars
using analytical and computational tools such as STARLAB, which performs
numerical scattering experiments with direct N-body integration. Cluster
pulsars with intermediate eccentricities can mostly be accounted for by fly-bys
whereas those with high eccentricities are likely to be the result of exchanges
and/or mergers of single stars with the binary companion of the pulsar,
although there are a few objects which do not easily fit into this description.
The corresponding distribution for galactic field pulsars shows notable
differences from the GC pulsar orbital period and eccentricity distribution.
The long orbital period pulsars in the galactic field with frozen out low
eccentricities are largely missing from the globular clusters, and we show that
ionization of these systems in GCs cannot alone account for the peculiarities.

the deviation from Minkowski space is linear in L rather than exponentially

surprisingly high in spite of the pumps being classical fields. For some
implementations where the connecting element can be a fiber, long-distance
steady state quantum correlations can be established. Furthermore, the maximal
of entanglement for any pair is achieved when their corresponding direct
coupling is much smaller than their individual couplings to the third party.
This effect is reminiscent of the establishment of coherence between otherwise

measure this entanglement by analyzing the correlations of the emitted photons

available data, promising great scientific advance. However, if misused, it can
be little more than the black-box application of complex computing algorithms

applications from a broad range of astronomy, emphasizing those where data
mining techniques directly resulted in improved science, and important current

presented here for this 118-deg^2 region is combined with ones derived from
surrounding regions also covered by the ALFALFA survey to examine the large
scale structure in the complex Leo region. Because of the combination of wide
sky coverage and superior sensitivity, spatial and spectral resolution, the
ALFALFA HI catalog of the Leo region improves significantly on the numbers of
low HI mass sources as compared with those found in previous HI surveys. The HI
mass function of the Leo I group presented here is dominated by low-mass
objects: 45 of the 65 Leo I members have M_HI < 10^8 Msun, yielding tight
constraints on the low-mass slope of the Leo I HI mass function. The best-fit
slope is alpha < -1.41 + 0.2 - 0.1. A direct comparison between the ALFALFA HI
line detections and an optical search of the Leo I region proves the advantage
of the ALFALFA strategy in finding low mass, gas-rich dwarfs. These results
suggest the existence of a significant population of low surface brightness,
gas-rich, yet still very low HI mass galaxies, and may reflect the same type of
morphological segregation as is seen in the Local Group. While the low mass end
slope of the Leo I HI mass function is steeper than that determined for
luminosity functions of the group, the slope still falls short of the values
predicted by simulations of structure formation in the LCDM paradigm.

paper, we argue that it should be seen as an empirical addition to Bayesian
reasoning itself. Particularly, we show how to view the Born Rule as a
normative rule in addition to usual Dutch-book coherence. It is a rule that
takes into account how one should assign probabilities to the consequences of
various intended measurements on a physical system, but explicitly in terms of
prior probabilities for and conditional probabilities consequent upon the
imagined outcomes of a special counterfactual reference measurement. This
interpretation is seen particularly clearly by representing quantum states in
terms of probabilities for the outcomes of a fixed, fiducial symmetric
informationally complete (SIC) measurement. We further explore the extent to
which the general form of the new normative rule implies the full state-space
structure of quantum mechanics. It seems to get quite far.

microwave background sky as measured from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy
Probe (WMAP) five-year data. These measurements are compared with theoretical
predictions which assume that the cosmological signal obeys Gaussian
statistics. We find significant differences from the simplest Gaussian-based
prediction. However, the measurements are sensitive to the fact that the noise
is spatially inhomogeneous (e.g., because different parts of the sky were
observed for different lengths of time). We show how to account for this
spatial inhomogeneity when making predictions. Differences from the
Gaussian-based expectation remain even after this more careful accounting of
the noise. In particular, we note that hot and cold pixels cluster differently
within the same temperature thresholds at few-degree scales. While these
findings may indicate primordial non-Gaussianity, we discuss other plausible
explanations for these discrepancies. In addition, we find some deviations from
Gaussianity at sub-degree scales, especially in the W band, whose origin may be
associated with extragalactic dust emission.

estimate a wide range of physical properties, including star-formation rate

high electron densities (~1000 cm^(-3)) are inferred compared to local
galaxies, and [OIII]/[OII] line ratios indicate higher ionization parameters
compared to the local population. Building on previous similar results at z~2,
these measurements provide further evidence (at high S/N) that star-forming
regions are significantly different in high-redshift galaxies, compared to
their local counterparts (abridged).

total swept-up mass overtaken by the shock. SN2006gy can be interpreted in the
context of shock interaction with a dense CSM, but with quite extreme values
for the CSM mass of 20 Msun and an explosion kinetic energy of at least 5e51
erg. A key difference between SN2006gy and other SNeIIn is that, owing to its
large CSM mass, the interaction region remained opaque much longer. At early
times, H-alpha widths suggest that the photosphere is ahead of the shock, and
photons diffuse out through the opaque CSM. The pivotal transition to optically
thin emission begins around day 110, when we start to see a decrease in the
blackbody radius and strengthening tracers of the post-shock shell. From the
evolution of pre-shock velocities, we deduce that the CSM was ejected by the
progenitor in a 1e49 erg precursor event 8yr before explosion. The large CSM
mass rules out models involving stars with initial masses around 10Msun. With
the full mass budget, even massive M_ZAMS=30-40 Msun progenitor stars are
inadequate. At roughly solar metallicity, substantial mass loss probably
occurred during the star's life, so SN 2006gy's progenitor is more consistent
with LBV eruptions or pulsational pair-instability ejections in stars with
initial masses above 100 Msun. This requires significant revision to current
paradigms of massive-star evolution. (abridged)

standard SN theory. We present new ground-based near-infrared (NIR)
observations of SN 2006gy, as well as a single epoch of Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) imaging obtained more than two years after the explosion. Our NIR data
taken around peak optical emission show an evolution that is largely consistent
with a cooling blackbody, with tentative evidence for a growing NIR excess
starting at day ~100. Our late-time Keck adaptive optics (AO) NIR image, taken
on day 723, shows little change from previous NIR observations taken around day
400. Furthermore, the optical HST observations show a reduced decline rate
after day 400, and the SN is bluer on day 810 than it was at peak. This
late-time decline is inconsistent with Co56 decay, and thus is problematic for
the various pair-instability SN models used to explain the nature of SN 2006gy.
The slow decline of the NIR emission can be explained with a light echo, and we
confirm that the late-time NIR excess is the result of a massive (>10 Msun)
dusty shell heated by the SN peak luminosity. The late-time optical
observations require the existence of a scattered light echo, which may be
generated by the same dust that contributes to the NIR echo. Both the NIR and
optical echoes originate in the proximity of the progenitor, ~10^18 cm for the
NIR echo and <~10-40 pc for the optical echo, which provides further evidence
that the progenitor of SN 2006gy was a very massive star.

increase in the star-formation rate due to the merger. Most of the clusters
have velocities in agreement with nearby molecular and HI gas that has been
previously shown to be rotating within the progenitor galaxies, hence
star/cluster formation is still taking place within the galactic disks.
However, three clusters have radial velocities that are inconsistent with being
part of the rotating gas disks, which is surprising given their young
(200-500Myr) ages. Interestingly, we find a stellar association with the same
colors (V-I) near one of these three clusters, suggesting that the cluster and
association were formed concurrently and have remained spatially correlated. We
find evidence for spatially distributed cluster formation throughout the

distribution are explored, and we do not find evidence for long term ""infant

November 2006. We compare the SUMER spectra observed in the umbra, penumbra,
plage, and sunspot plume regions. The Lyman line profiles averaged in each
region are presented. For the sunspot observed in 2006, the electron densities,
DEM, and filling factors of the TR plasma in the four regions are also
investigated. The self-reversals of the Lyman line profiles are almost absent
in umbral regions at different locations (heliocentric angle up to $49^\circ$)
on the solar disk. In the sunspot plume, the Lyman lines are also not reversed,
whilst the lower Lyman line profiles observed in the plage region are obviously
reversed. The TR densities of the umbra and plume are similar and one order of
magnitude lower than those of the plage and penumbra. The DEM curve of the
sunspot plume exhibits a peak centered around $\log(T/\rm{K})\sim5.45$, which
exceeds the DEM of other regions by one to two orders of magnitude at these
temperatures. We also find that more than 100 lines, which are very weak or not
observed anywhere else on the Sun, are well observed by SUMER in the sunspot,
especially in the sunspot plume. We suggest that the TR above sunspots is
higher and probably more extended, and that the opacity of the hydrogen lines
is much smaller above sunspots, as compared to the TR above plage regions. Our
result indicates that the enhanced TR emission of the sunspot plume is very
likely to be the result of a large filling factor. The strongly enhanced
emission at TR temperatures and the reduced continuum make many normally weak
TR lines stick out clearly in the spectra of sunspot plumes.

the decisions individuals make. These networks link different types of
entities, for example, people and the events they attend. Network analysis
algorithms usually project such networks unto simple graphs composed of
entities of a single type. In the process, they conflate relations between
entities of different types and loose important structural information. We
develop a mathematical framework that can be used to compactly represent and
analyze heterogeneous networks that combine multiple entity and link types. We
generalize Bonacich centrality, which measures connectivity between nodes by
the number of paths between them, to heterogeneous networks and use this
measure to study network structure. Specifically, we extend the popular
modularity-maximization method for community detection to use this centrality
metric. We also rank nodes based on their connectivity to other nodes. One
advantage of this centrality metric is that it has a tunable parameter we can
use to set the length scale of interactions. By studying how rankings change
with this parameter allows us to identify important nodes in the network. We
apply the proposed method to analyze the structure of several heterogeneous
networks. We show that exploiting additional sources of evidence corresponding
to links between, as well as among, different entity types yields new insights
into network structure.

pericenter passage, which makes post-Newtonian effects potentially detectable.
We formulate the orbit equations in Hamiltonian form such that the $O(v^2/c^2)$
and $O(v^3/c^3)$ post-Newtonian effects of the Kerr metric appear as a simple
generalization of the Kepler problem. A related perturbative Hamiltonian
applies to photon paths. We then derive a symplectic integrator with adaptive
time-steps, for fast and accurate numerical calculation of post-Newtonian
effects. Using this integrator, we explore relativistic effects. Taking the
star S2 as an example, we find that general relativity would contribute tenths
of mas in astrometry and tens of $\rm km s^{-1}$ in kinematics. (For eventual
comparison with observations, redshift and time-delay contributions from the
gravitational field on light paths will need to be calculated, but we do
attempt these in the present paper.) The contribution from stars, gas, and dark
matter in the Galactic center region is still poorly constrained
observationally, but current models suggest that the resulting Newtonian
perturbation on the orbits could plausibly be of the same order as the
relativistic effects for stars with semi-major axes $\gtrsim 0.01$ pc (or 250
mas). Nevertheless, the known and distinctive {\it time dependence} of the
relativistic perturbations may make it possible to disentangle and extract both
effects from observations.

self consistent accretion disk model based on the similarity solution for the
disk surface density and constrain the dust radial density distribution on
spatial scales of about 40 AU. Disk surface densities appear to be correlated
with the stellar ages where the characteristic disk radius increases from ~ 20
AU to 100 AU over about 5 Myr. This disk expansion is accompanied by a decrease
in the mass accretion rate, suggesting that our sample disks form an
evolutionary sequence. Interpreting our results in terms of the temporal
evolution of a viscous $\alpha$-disk, we estimate (i) that at the beginning of
the disk evolution about 60% of the circumstellar material was located inside
radii of 25--40 AU, (ii) that disks formed with masses from 0.05 to 0.4
M$_{\sun}$ and (iii) that the viscous timescale at the disk initial radius is
about 0.1-0.3 Myr. Viscous disk models tightly link the surface density
$\Sigma(R)$ with the radial profile of the disk viscosity $\nu(R) \propto
R^{\gamma}$. We find values of $\gamma$ ranging from -0.8 to 0.8, suggesting
that the viscosity dependence on the orbital radius can be very different in
the observed disks. Adopting the $\alpha$ parameterization for the viscosity,
we argue that $\alpha$ must decrease with the orbital radius and that it may
vary between 0.5 and $10^{-4}$. (abridged)

cell signaling processes. Electron micrographs of immunogold-labeled Ras have
shown that membrane-bound Ras molecules segregate into nanocluster domains.
Several models have been developed in attempts to obtain quantitative
descriptions of nanocluster formation, but all have relied on assumptions such
as a constant, expression-level independent ratio of Ras in clusters to Ras
monomers (cluster/monomer ratio). However, this assumption is inconsistent with
the law of mass action. Here, we present a biophysical model of Ras clustering
based on short-range attraction and long-range repulsion between Ras molecules
in the membrane. To test this model, we performed Monte Carlo simulations and
compared statistical clustering properties with experimental data. We find that
we can recover the experimentally-observed clustering across a range of Ras
expression levels, without assuming a constant cluster/monomer ratio or the
existence of lipid rafts. In addition, our model makes predictions about the
signaling properties of Ras nanoclusters in support of the idea that Ras
nanoclusters act as an analog-digital-analog converter for high fidelity
signaling.

detect CNVs with fairly high reliability. Hidden Markov models and algorithms
have played a dominant role in the interpretation of CNV data. Here we explore
CNV reconstruction via estimation with a fused-lasso penalty as suggested by
Tibshirani and Wang [Biostatistics 9 (2008) 18--29]. We mount a fresh attack on
this difficult optimization problem by the following: (a) changing the penalty
terms slightly by substituting a smooth approximation to the absolute value
function, (b) designing and implementing a new MM (majorization--minimization)
algorithm, and (c) applying a fast version of Newton's method to jointly update
all model parameters. Together these changes enable us to minimize the
fused-lasso criterion in a highly effective way. We also reframe the
reconstruction problem in terms of imputation via discrete optimization. This
approach is easier and more accurate than parameter estimation because it
relies on the fact that only a handful of possible copy number states exist at
each SNP. The dynamic programming framework has the added bonus of exploiting
information that the current fused-lasso approach ignores. The accuracy of our
imputations is comparable to that of hidden Markov models at a substantially
lower computational cost.

metallicity distribution function (MDF) for the Galactic bulge, centered on
[Fe/H]=-0.1. However, recently, a new opportunity emerged to utilize temporary
flux amplification (by factors of ~100 or more) of faint dwarf stars in the
Bulge that are gravitationally lensed, making them observable with
high-resolution spectrographs during a short observational window.
Surprisingly, of the first 6 stars measured, 5 have [Fe/H]>+0.30, suggesting a
highly skewed MDF, inconsistent with observations of giant stars. Here we
present a detailed elemental abundance analysis of OGLE-2009-BLG-076S, based on
a high-resolution spectrum obtained with the UVES spectrograph at the ESO Very
Large Telescope. Our results indicate it is the most metal-poor dwarf star in
the Bulge yet observed, with [Fe/H]=-0.76. Our results argue against a strong
selection effect disfavoring metal-poor microlensed stars. It is possible that
small number statistics is responsible for the giant/dwarf Bulge MDF
discrepancy. Should this discrepancy survive when larger numbers of Bulge dwarf
stars (soon to be available) are analyzed, it may require modification of our
understanding of either Bulge formation models, or the behavior of metal-rich
giant stars.

the two stars with unprecedented precision. The polar and equatorial regions of
the two stars have ~2000K temperature gradient, causing their apparent

measurements and precise geometrical constraint. Lastly, we investigate the

especially affects the modeling of Alpha Oph. Although incorporating Vsin(i)

some desired singular values when the columns of $A$ almost linearly dependent.
Furthermore, harmonic Ritz vectors may converge irregularly and even may fail

eigenproblems due to the first author, we propose a refined harmonic Lanczos
bidiagonalization method that takes the Rayleigh quotients of the harmonic Ritz
vectors as approximate singular values and extracts the best approximate
singular vectors, called the refined harmonic Ritz approximations, from the
given subspaces in the sense of residual minimizations. The refined
approximations are shown to converge to the desired singular vectors once the
subspaces are sufficiently good and the Rayleigh quotients converge. An
implicitly restarted refined harmonic Lanczos bidiagonalization algorithm
(IRRHLB) is developed. We study how to select the best possible shifts, and
suggest refined harmonic shifts that are theoretically better than the harmonic
shifts used within the implicitly restarted Lanczos bidiagonalization algorithm
(IRHLB). We propose a novel procedure that can numerically compute the refined
harmonic shifts efficiently and accurately. Numerical experiments are reported
that compare IRRHLB with five other algorithms based on the Lanczos
bidiagonalization process. It appears that IRRHLB is at least competitive with
them and can be considerably more efficient when computing the smallest

non-vanishing angular momentum are given. (ii) Eight-shaped curves which are
similar to the curve for the figure-eight solution and the energy constant are
given.
  The reality of the motion should be tested whether the motion satisfies an

are applicable to generic curves which does not have point symmetry. Each body

multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cognitive radio channel (CRC) is studied
when there is imperfect and perfect channel knowledge at the transmitters
(CSIT) and the receivers, respectively. In particular, the problem of
optimizing the sum-rate of the MIMO CRC over the transmit covariance matrices
is dealt with. Such an optimization, under the DPC-based transmission strategy,
needs to be performed jointly with an optimization over the inflation factor.
To this end, first the problem of determination of inflation factor over the
MIMO channel $Y=H_1 X + H_2 S + Z$ with imperfect CSIT is investigated. For
this problem, two iterative algorithms, which generalize the corresponding
algorithms proposed for the channel $Y=H(X+S)+Z$, are developed. Later, the
necessary conditions for maximizing the sum-rate of the MIMO CRC over the
transmit covariances for a given choice of inflation factor are derived. Using
these necessary conditions and the algorithms for the determination of the
inflation factor, an iterative, numerical algorithm for the joint optimization
is proposed. Some interesting observations are made from the numerical results
obtained from the algorithm. Furthermore, the high-SNR sum-rate scaling factor
achievable over the CRC with imperfect CSIT is obtained.

that the most pronounced features occur for energies of the STM tip matching
the Landau level energies. The Fourier transform of the LDOS shows regions of
high intensity centered around the center and the corners of the Brillouin zone
(BZ). The radial intensity dependence of these features is determined by the
form of the wavefunctions of the electrons in the quantum Hall regime.
Moreover, some of these regions break rotational symmetry, and their angular
dependence is determined by the chirality of the graphene electrons. For the
zeroth Landau level, the ratio between the features at the corners and center
of the BZ depends on the nature of the disorder: it goes to zero for potential
disorder, and is finite for hopping disorder. We believe that a comparison
between our analysis and experiments will help understand the form of the
quasiparticle wavefunction, as well as the nature of disorder in graphene.

can be deduced from rotating stellar models of single stars. The type of the SN
progenitor was determined from the surface abundances at the pre-SN stage. The
type of the SN event was obtained from the masses of hydrogen and helium
ejected at the time of the core-collapse SN event. We find that the minimum
amount of helium ejected by a core-collapse SN (of whatever type) is around 0.3
MSun. There is no difference between the WC and WO stars in the ejected masses
of helium, CNO elements, and heavy elements. Also no difference is expected
between the chemical composition of a WC star resulting from a normal or a
homogeneous evolution. The progenitors of type Ib SNe are WNL, WNE, or less
massive WC stars. Those of type Ic are WC and WO stars. WO stars are produced
in a limited mass range (around 60 MSun) and only at low metallicity (for <=
0.010) as already found. The WO stars are the progenitors of only a small
fraction of type Ic. Present stellar models indicate that, at solar
metallicity, there is about 1 type Ib SN for 1 type Ic, and this ratio rises to
3 type Ic for 1 type Ib SN at twice solar metallicity. At this metallicity,
type Ic's are more frequent than type Ib's because most massive stars that go
through a WNE stage evolve further into a WC/WO phase. Current models can
account for the observed number ratios SN Ib/SN II and SN Ic/SN II and for
their observed variation with the metallicity. In case no supernova occurs when
a black hole is formed, single-star models can still account for more than half
of the observed (SN Ib+SN Ic)/SN II ratio for Z >= ZSun. For the GRB rate, our
models produce too large a number for such an event, even if we restrict the
progenitor to the WO stars.

many-server queueing systems in heavy traffic. The queueing model under
consideration has multiple customer classes, indexed by a finite set
$\mathcal{I}$, and heterogenous, exponential servers. Servers are dynamically
chosen to serve customers, and buffers are available for customers waiting to
be served. The arrival rates and the number of servers are scaled up in such a
way that the processes representing the number of class-$i$ customers in the
system, $i\in\mathcal{I}$, fluctuate about a static fluid model, that is
assumed to be critically loaded in a standard sense. At the same time, the
fluid model is assumed to be throughput suboptimal. Roughly, this means that
the servers can be allocated so as to achieve a total processing rate that is
greater than the total arrival rate. We show that there exists a dynamic
control policy for the queueing model that is efficient in the following strong
sense: Under this policy, for every finite $T$, the measure of the set of times
prior to $T$, at which at least one customer is in the buffer, converges to
zero in probability as the arrival rates and number of servers go to infinity.
On the way to prove our main result, we provide a characterization of
throughput suboptimality in terms of properties of the buffer-station graph.

One can instead regard decompositions as part of the theory, and ask what
conditions they must satisfy for self-consistency. It is shown that
self-consistent decompositions that specify a measurement context (i.e. von
Neumann decompositions) must represent apparatus as containing internal
decohering environments and as having known pointer components and ready
states. Under these circumstances a von Neumann decomposition can function as a
component of the ready state of the observer. Minimal no-collapse quantum
mechanics supplemented by these consistency requirements on von Neumann
decompositions avoids the measurement problem.

existing weak magnetic fields in the solar atmosphere, was first directly
observed in a single event by Nagata et al. (2008) using the high resolution
Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) of the Hinode satellite. Using the same space
telescope, we performed a statistical analysis of convective collapse events.
  Methods. Our data sets consist of high resolution time series of polarimetric
spectral scans of two iron lines formed in the lower photosphere and filter
images in Mg I b2 and Ca II H, spectral lines that are formed in the high
photosphere and the lower chromosphere, respectively. We were thus able to
study the implication of convective collapse events on the high photospheric
and the chromospheric layers. The physical parameters from the full Stokes
profiles were obtained with the MERLIN Milne-Eddington inversion code.
  Results. We found that in all cases, the event was accompanied by a continuum
bright point and nearly always by a brightening in the Ca II H images. The
magnesium dopplergram exhibits a strong downflow in about three quarters of the
events that took place within the field of view of the magnesium dopplergram.
For each of the 49 events we determined the duration, maximum photospheric
downflow, field strength increase and size. We found event durations of about
10 minutes, magnetic element radii of about 0.43 arcsec and 0.35 arcsec, before
and after the event, respectively, and field strengths of up to 1.65 kG.

from vibrationally or rotationally excited upper levels that suggest warm gas
temperatures (400 to 700 K). However, standard models of PDRs are unable to
reproduce such warm rotational temperatures. In this paper we attempt to
explain these observations with new comprehensive models which extend from the
H+ region through the Bar and include the magnetic field in the equation of
state. We adopt the model parameters from our previous paper which successfully
reproduced a wide variety of spectral observations across the Bar. In this
model the local cosmic-ray density is enhanced above the galactic background,
as is the magnetic field, and which increases the cosmic-ray heating elevating
the temperature in the molecular region. The pressure is further enhanced above
the gas pressure in the H+ region by the momentum transferred from the absorbed
starlight. Here we investigate whether the observed H2 lines can be reproduced
with standard assumptions concerning the grain photoelectric emission. We also
explore the effects due to the inclusion of recently computed H2 + H2, H2 + H

connected communication graph, and compute an edge coloring of this graph such
that the transmitter-receiver pairs in each color class can communicate
simultaneously. Depending on the interference model, more or less colors,
corresponding to the number of frequencies or time slots, are necessary. We
consider the SINR model that compares the received power of a signal at a
receiver to the sum of the strength of other signals plus ambient noise . The
strength of a signal is assumed to fade polynomially with the distance from the
sender, depending on the so-called path-loss exponent $\alpha$.
  We show that, when all transmitters use the same power, the number of colors
needed is constant in one-dimensional grids if $\alpha>1$ as well as in
two-dimensional grids if $\alpha>2$. For smaller path-loss exponents and
two-dimensional grids we prove upper and lower bounds in the order of

binaries through the stable Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) channel of
intermediate-mass binaries. We aim at setting out the properties of hot
subdwarfs and their progenitors, so that we can understand the formation and
evolution of hot subdwarfs comprehensively. We have obtained the ranges of the
initial parameters of progenitor binaries and the properties of hot subdwarfs
through the stable RLOF channel of intermediate-mass binaries, e.g. mass,
envelope mass and age of hot subdwarfs. We have found that hot subdwarfs could
be formed through the stable Roche lobe overflow at main sequence and
Hertzsprung gap. We have also found that some subdwarf B or OB stars have
anomalous high mass (around 1 solar mass) with thick envelope (0.07 solar mass
to 0.16 solar mass) in our models. By comparing our theoretical results with
observations on the hot subdwarfs in open clusters, we suppose a quantity of
hot subdwarfs in binary systems might be found in open clusters in the future.

bispectrum signal from the primary-lensing-Rees-Sciama correlation; we point
out that it can be a significant contaminant to the bispectrum signal from
primordial non-Gaussianity of the local type. This non-Gaussianity, usually
parameterized by the non-Gaussian parameter f_NL, arises, for example, in
multi-field inflation. In particular both signals are frequency independent,
and are maximized for nearly squeezed configurations. While their detailed
scale-dependence and harmonic imprints are different for generic bispectrum
shapes, we show that, if not included in the modeling, the
primary-lensing-Rees-Sciama contribution yields an effective f_{NL} of 10 when
using a bispectrum estimator optimized for local non-Gaussianity. Considering
that expected 1-sigma errors on f_{NL} are < 10 from forthcoming experiments,
we conclude that the contribution from this signal must be included in future
constraints on f_{NL} from the Cosmic Microwave Background bispectrum.

are three stages: pre-hole-boring, hole-boring and the light sail acceleration.
We study the electron and ion dynamics in the first stage and find the minimum
foil thickness requirement for a given laser intensity. Based on this analysis,
we propose to use a shaped foil for ion acceleration, whose thickness varies
transversely to match the laser intensity. Then, the target evolves into three
regions: the acceleration, transparency and deformation regions. In the
acceleration region, the target can be uniformly accelerated producing a
mono-energetic and spatially collimated ion beam. Detailed numerical
simulations are performed to check the feasibility and robustness of this
scheme, such as the influence of shape factors and surface roughness. A GeV
mono-energetic proton beam is observed in the three dimensional
particle-in-cell simulations when a laser pulse with the focus intensity of
1022W=cm2 is used. The energy conversion efficiency of laser pulse to
accelerated proton beam is more than 23%. Synchrotron radiation and damping
effects are also checked in the interaction.

the lowest cost. It is interesting to note that these constraints are very
similar to those existing in Network Telecommunication Industry. We propose to
study how emerging technologies like ATCA and $\mu$TCA could be used in
neutrino experiments. We describe the design of an Advanced Mezzanine Board

the front panel and sends the formatted data through the $\mu$TCA backplane
using a Gigabit Ethernet link. The gigabit switch of the MCH is used to
centralize and to send the data to the event building computer. The core of
this card is a FPGA (ARIA-GX from ALTERA) including the whole system except the
memories. A hardware accelerator has been implemented using a NIOS II $\mu$P
and a Gigabit MAC IP. Obviously, in order to be able to reconstruct the tracks
from the events a time synchronisation system is mandatory. We decided to
implement the IEEE1588 standard also called Precision Timing Protocol, another
emerging and promising technology in Telecommunication Industry. In this
article we describe a Gigabit PTP implementation using the recovered clock of

to first order in trigonometric functions of hyper-spherical angles; 2) the
(approximate) three-string potential to all orders in the power expansion in
hyper-spherical harmonics, but without taking into account the transition(s) to
two-string potentials; 3) the exact minimal-length string potential to all
orders in power expansion in hyper-spherical harmonics, and taking into account

improvement %convergence of these approximations: The exact non-perturbative
corrections to the total energy are of the order of one per cent, as compared

another two orders of magnitude. In all cases we observe a huge low-mass
enhancement in the $\pi\pi$-invariant mass accompanied by a pronounced
$\Delta\Delta$ excitation. For the most basic fusion reaction, the $pn \to
d\pi^0\pi^0$ reaction, we observe in addition a very pronounced resonance-like
energy dependence in the total cross section with a maximum 90 MeV below the
$\Delta\Delta$ mass and a width of only 50 MeV, which is five times smaller
than expected from a conventional $t$-channel $\Delta\Delta$ excitation. This
reveals the ABC effect to be the consequence of a s-channel resonance with the
formfactor of this dibaryonic state being reflected in the low-mass enhancement
of the $\pi\pi$-invariant mass. From the fusion reactions to $^3$He and $^4$He
we learn that this resonance is robust enough to survive even in nuclei.

the linear case, they contain $(\nu+1)$th-degree polynomials with

This particular structure property gives rise to complex azimuthal dependences

interplay of site specific dipole-quadrupole and quadrupole-quadrupole resonant
scattering. Also evidenced is an isotropic character of the absorption
spectrum. Self-absorption correction to the diffraction data, as well as
possible contributions of thermal vibrations and magnetic order, are discussed.

effective field theory of nuclear matter with nucleons and pions as degrees of
freedom [1]. It allows for a systematic expansion taking into account both
local as well as pion-mediated multi-nucleon interactions. We apply this power
counting in the present study to the evaluation of the pion self-energy and the
energy density in nuclear and neutron matter at next-to-leading order. To
implement this power counting in actual calculations we develop here a
non-perturbative method based on Unitary Chiral Perturbation Theory for
performing the required resummations. We show explicitly that the contributions
to the pion self-energy with in-medium nucleon-nucleon interactions to this
order cancel. The main trends for the energy density of symmetric nuclear and
neutron matter are already reproduced at next-to-leading order. In addition, an
accurate description of the neutron matter equation of state, as compared with
sophisticated many-body calculations, is obtained by varying only slightly a
subtraction constant around its expected value. The case of symmetric nuclear
matter requires the introduction of an additional fine-tuned subtraction
constant, parameterizing the effects from higher order contributions. With
that, the empirical saturation point and the nuclear matter incompressiblity
are well reproduced while the energy per nucleon as a function of density
closely agrees with sophisticated calculations in the literature.

describing the possible changes in the parameters of the digital straight
segment under investigation. This description is achieved by considering new
parameters on digital segments: instead of their arithmetic description, we
examine the parameters related to their combinatoric description. As a result
we have a better understanding of their evolution during recognition and
analytical formulas to compute them. We also show how this evolution can be
projected onto the Stern-Brocot tree. These new relations have interesting
consequences on the geometry of digital curves. We show how they can for
instance be used to bound the slope difference between consecutive maximal

Method to reveal the BC structures. These ideas are applied to excitable cell
networks (including neural cell networks), and genomic regulatory networks.
Universal BC structures are identified clearly in these two considerably
different systems. These BC structures reveal for the first time both
oscillation sources and wave propagation pathways of complex networks, and
guide us to control the oscillations with surprisingly high efficiency.

electron- and hole-like states at the conduction- and valence-band edges
interchanged) can be used to inject, precess, and detect the electron spin
along a one-dimensional pathway. The restriction of the electron motion to a
single spatial dimension ensures that all electrons experience the same amount
of precession in a parallel magnetic field, so that the full electrical current
can be switched on and off. As an example, we calculate the magnetoconductance
of a p-n interface in a HgTe quantum well and show how it can be used to
measure the spin precession due to bulk inversion asymmetry.

excess (UVX) objects play a key role in investigations of the frequency and
types of binary companions and the distribution of orbital periods. These are
important for establishing whether and by which channels the sd stars arise
from interactions in close binary systems. It has been suggested that the list
of PG sd stars is biased by the exclusion of many stars in binaries, whose
spectra show the Ca II K line in absorption. A total of 1125 objects that were
photometrically selected as candidates were ultimately rejected from the final
PG catalog using this K-line criterion. We study 88 of these ""PG-Rejects""
(PGRs), to assess whether there are significant numbers of unrecognized sd
stars in binaries among the PGR objects. The presence of a sd should cause a
large UVX. We assemble GALEX, Johnson V, and 2MASS photometry and compare the
colors of these PGR objects with those of known sd stars, cool single stars,
and hot+cool binaries. Sixteen PGRs were detected in both the far- and near-
ultraviolet GALEX passbands. Eleven of these, plus the 72 cases with only an
upper limit in the far-ultraviolet band, are interpreted as single cool stars.
Of the remaining five stars, three are consistent with being sd stars paired
with a cool main sequence companion, while two may be single stars or composite
systems of another type. We discuss the implications of these findings for the
1125 PGR objects as a whole. (slightly abridged)

three-terminal setup of common use: an injector, which can be interacting,
coupled by both extended tunneling and Coulomb interactions to an inhomogeneous
wire with any range of interactions and scattering processes. Some of the
crucial results we obtain are of relevance to other muti-terminal geometries.
We show that the voltage of the injector does not cut the flow of relevant
scattering processes in the wire. Either a grounded or a semi-infinite wire at
too low temperature is driven into the strong coupling regime.
  We show that the injector induce invasive effects. They are due to non-local
backscattering processes generated both by virtual higher order tunneling
processes and by Coulomb interactions with the injector. The latter induce in
addition screening of interactions in the wire. For an STM, those effects can
drastically mask the probed density of states (DOS). In the limit of zero
temperature, a long and grounded wire is driven to its fixed point where it is
disconnected at the tunneling point. Thus instead of the bulk expected DOS, the
STM probes the end one. We analyze current auto- and cross-correlations. We
show that the cross-correlations are dominated by their value in the
two-terminal geometry. As these are opposite to the current auto-correlations,
they are always negative for local scattering processes. We give novel scaling
laws to all orders with respect to a local backscattering.
