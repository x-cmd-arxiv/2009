channels at next-to-next to leading order starting from a recently proposed
non-relativistic chiral effective theory, which includes dibaryon fields as
fundamental degrees of freedom. We restrict ourselves to center of mass
energies (E) smaller than the pion mass (m_pi), and further divide the
calculation into two relative momentum (p) regions, a high energy one p ~ m_pi
>> delta m_i, \delta m_i being the dibaryon residual masses, and low energy one
p ~ delta m_i. We first match to a lower energy effective theory in which we
calculate the amplitudes in the high energy region. We further match this
effective theory to the so called pionless effective theory in the low energy
region, and carry out the calculations in the latter. Dimensional
regularization and minimal subtraction scheme are used throughout. For 1S0
channel a good description of the phase shift data is obtained for E < 50 MeV.
For the 3S1-3D1 channel, the 3S1 phase shift data is only well described up to
E < 20 MeV.

developed in frustrated ferromagnets, where the spin nematic states are
described as the resonating spin-triplet valence bond (RVB) states. The
d-vectors of spin-triplet pairing ansatzes play the role of the directors in
the bond-type spin quadrupolar states. The low-energy excitations around such
spin-triplet RVB ansatzes generally comprise the (potentially massless) gauge
bosons, massless Goldstone bosons, and spinon individual excitations. Extending
the projective symmetry group argument to the spin-triplet ansatzes, we show
how to identify the number of massless gauge bosons efficiently. Applying this
formulation, we next (i) enumerate possible mean field solutions for the S=1/2
ferromagnetic J1-J2 Heisenberg model on the square lattice, with ferromagnetic
nearest neighbor J1 and competing antiferromagnetic next-nearest neighbor J2,

two stable spin-triplet RVB ansatzes are found in the intermediate coupling
regime around J1:J2 \simeq 1:0.4. One is the Z_2 Balian-Werthamer (BW) state
stabilized by the Higgs mechanism and the other is the SU(2) chiral p-wave

structurally close-to homologous with close-to isothermal total density

choice of a pair (u,v) of Coxeter elements in the symmetric group and the
corresponding networks N_{u,v}^\circ in the annulus. Boundary measurements for
N_{u,v} represent elements of the Coxeter double Bruhat cell G^{u,v} in GL_n.
The Cartan subgroup acts on G^{u,v} by conjugation. The standard Poisson
structure on the space of weights of N_{u,v} induces a Poisson structure on
G^{u,v}, and hence on its quotient by the Cartan subgroup, which makes the
latter into the phase space for an appropriate Coxeter--Toda lattice. The
boundary measurement for N_{u,v}^\circ is a rational function that coincides up
to a nonzero factor with the Weyl function for the boundary measurement for
N_{u,v}. The corresponding Poisson bracket on the space of weights of
N_{u,v}^\circ induces a Poisson bracket on the certain space of rational
functions, which appeared previously in the context of Toda flows.
  Following the ideas developed in our previous papers, we introduce a cluster
algebra A on this space, compatible with the obtained Poisson bracket.
Generalized B\""acklund--Darboux transformations map solutions of one
Coxeter--Toda lattice to solutions of another preserving the corresponding Weyl
function. Using network representation, we construct generalized
B\""acklund-Darboux transformations as appropriate sequences of cluster

transition region are a challenge for models and observations.
  Aims: We set out to get linearly- and quadratically-weighted average electron
densities in the region emitting the S VI lines, using the observed opacity and
the emission measure of these lines.
  Methods: We analyze SoHO/SUMER spectroscopic observations of the S VI lines,
using the center-to-limb variations and radiance ratios to derive the opacity.
We also use the Emission Measure derived from radiance at disk center.
  Results: We get an opacity at S VI line center of the order of 0.05. The
resulting average electron density is 2.4 10^16 m^-3 at T = 2 10^5 K. This
value is higher than the values obtained from radiance measurements.
Conversely, taking a classical value for the density leads to a too high value
of the thickness of the emitting layer.
  Conclusions: The pressure derived from the Emission Measure method compares
well with previous determinations and implies a low opacity of 5 10^-3 to
10^-2. The fact that a direct derivation leads to a much higher opacity remains
unexplained, despite tentative modeling of observational biases. Further
measurements need to be done, and more realistic models of the transition
region need to be used.

The flow is non-helical, and at initial time the kinetic and magnetic energies

validity of the method on grids of 512^3 points, we analyze the data on the
large grids up to Taylor Reynolds numbers of ~2200. We find that the global

prevents a conclusive answer on the nature of this emission. RRAT J1819-1458's
spin-down energy loss rate (Edot~3x10^{32} erg/s) is much lower than that of
other pulsars with observed spin-down powered pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe), and
implies a rather high X-ray efficiency of eta_{X} = L_(pwn; 0.5-8keV)/Edot~0.2
at converting spin-down power into the PWN X-ray emission. This suggests the
need of an additional source of energy rather than the spin-down power alone,
such as the high magnetic energy of this source. Furthermore, this Chandra
observation allowed us to refine the positional accuracy of RRAT J1819-1458 to
a radius of ~0.3"", and confirms the presence of X-ray pulsations and the ~1keV
absorption line, previously observed in the X-ray emission of this source.

analyze how the interplay of quantum and thermal fluctuations, both
non-Gaussian in nature, influences the shape of the phase boundary and the
region in the phase diagram where critical fluctuations occur. The solution of
the flow equations makes this interplay transparent: we detect finite
temperature crossovers by computing critical exponents and we confirm that the
power law describing the finite temperature phase boundary as a function of

that different methods highlight different aspects of a network's structure and
that the the sort of information that we seek to extract about the system must

including the popular modularity maximization approach, infer module
assignments from an underlying model of the network formation process. However,
we are not always as interested in how a system's network structure was formed,
as we are in how a network's extant structure influences the system's behavior.
To see how structure influences current behavior, we will recognize that links
in a network induce movement across the network and result in system-wide
interdependence. In doing so, we explicitly acknowledge that most networks
carry flow. To highlight and simplify the network structure with respect to
this flow, we use the map equation. We present an intuitive derivation of this
flow-based and information-theoretic method and provide an interactive on-line
application that anyone can use to explore the mechanics of the map equation.

a set of in-control data is available, and when both the in-control and
out-of-control distributions of the process are unknown. Existing process
control techniques typically require substantial knowledge about the in-control
and out-of-control distributions of the process, which is often difficult to
obtain in practice. We propose (a) using a sequence of control limits for the
cumulative sum (CUSUM) control charts, where the control limits are determined
by the conditional distribution of the CUSUM statistic given the last time it
was zero, and (b) estimating the control limits by bootstrap. Traditionally,
the CUSUM control chart uses a single control limit, which is obtained under
the assumption that the in-control and out-of-control distributions of the
process are Normal. When the normality assumption is not valid, which is often
true in applications, the actual in-control average run length, defined to be
the expected time duration before the control chart signals a process change,
is quite different from the nominal in-control average run length. This
limitation is mostly eliminated in the proposed procedure, which is
distribution-free and robust against different choices of the in-control and
out-of-control distributions.

The inclusions represent protein molecules which perform cyclic internal
conformational motions driven by the energy brought with ATP ligands. As
protein conformations cyclically change, this induces hydrodynamical flows and
also directly affects the local curvature of a membrane. On the other hand,
variations in the local curvature of the membrane modify the transitions rates
between conformational states in a protein, leading to a feedback in the
considered system. Moreover, active inclusions can move diffusively through the
membrane so that surface concentration varies. The kinetic description of this
system is constructed and the stability of the uniform stationary state is
analytically investigated. We show that, as the rate of supply of chemical
energy is increased above a certain threshold, this uniform state becomes
unstable and stationary or traveling waves spontaneously develop in the system.
Such waves are accompanied by periodic spatial variation of membrane curvature
and inclusion density. For typical parameter values, their characteristic
wavelengths are of the order of hundreds of nanometers. For traveling waves,
the characteristic frequency is of the order of a thousand Hz or less.

the health effects of particulate matter (PM). Influential epidemiological
studies that characterize chronic exposure of individuals rely on monitoring
data that are sparse in space and time, so they often assign the same exposure
to participants in large geographic areas and across time. We estimate monthly
PM during 1988--2002 in a large spatial domain for use in studying health
effects in the Nurses' Health Study. We develop a conceptually simple
spatio-temporal model that uses a rich set of covariates. The model is used to
estimate concentrations of $PM_{10}$ for the full time period and $PM_{2.5}$
for a subset of the period. For the earlier part of the period, 1988--1998, few
$PM_{2.5}$ monitors were operating, so we develop a simple extension to the
model that represents $PM_{2.5}$ conditionally on $PM_{10}$ model predictions.
In the epidemiological analysis, model predictions of $PM_{10}$ are more
strongly associated with health effects than when using simpler approaches to
estimate exposure. Our modeling approach supports the application in estimating
both fine-scale and large-scale spatial heterogeneity and capturing space--time
interaction through the use of monthly-varying spatial surfaces. At the same
time, the model is computationally feasible, implementable with standard
software, and readily understandable to the scientific audience. Despite
simplifying assumptions, the model has good predictive performance and
uncertainty characterization.

The decrease in transaction costs arises because financial institutions exploit

the interbank market which diverge in the limit of complete markets.
  These results suggest that the proliferation of financial instruments

initio DFT starts with a microscopic Hamiltonian and is naturally formulated
using orbital-based functionals, which generalize the conventional
local-density-plus-gradients form. The orbitals satisfy single-particle
equations with multiplicative (local) potentials. The DFT functionals can be
developed starting from internucleon forces using wave-function based methods
or by Legendre transform via effective actions. We describe known and
unresolved issues for applying these formulations to the nuclear many-body
problem and discuss how ab initio approaches can help improve empirical energy
density functionals.

occurs in the relativistic precession frequencies at characteristic radii, for
which the radial epicyclic frequency of the test particle motion attains its

system is simulated by an elastic chain of particles interacting with a rigid
foundation through breakable springs. Such system can be viewed as prototypical
for the description of a wide range of phenomena from peeling of polymeric
tapes, to rolling of cells, working of gecko's fibrillar structures and
denaturation of DNA. We construct a rigorous continuum limit of the discrete
model which captures both stable and metastable configurations and present a
detailed parametric study of the interplay between elastic and cohesive
interactions. We show that the model reproduces the experimentally observed
abrupt transition from an incremental evolution of the adhesion front to a
sudden complete decohesion of a macroscopic segment of the adhesion layer. As
the microscopic parameters vary the macroscopic response changes from
quasi-ductile to quasi-brittle, with corresponding decrease in the size of the
adhesion hysteresis. At the micro-scale this corresponds to a transition from a
`localized' to a `diffuse' structure of the decohesion front (domain wall). We
obtain an explicit expression for the critical debonding threshold in the limit
when the internal length scales are much smaller than the size of the system.
The achieved parametric control of the microscopic mechanism can be used in the
design of new biological inspired adhesion devices and machines.

which are found typically an order of magnitude smaller than those estimated in
the light-cone sum rules and in the non-relativistic quark model. As an
alternative, we adopt a hybrid pQCD approach, in which we compute the
factorizable contributions with the $\Lambda_b \to p$ form factors taken from
the light cone QCD sum rules. The non-factorizable diagrams are evaluated

results from high-resolution QSO samples. We compared the average opacity close
to the quasar emission with its expected behavior in the Lyalpha forest and
estimated the signature of the proximity effect towards individual objects at
high significance in about 98% of the QSOs. Dividing the whole sample of
objects in eight subsets according to their emission redshift, we inferred the
proximity effect strength distribution (PESD) on each of them finding in all
cases a prominent peak and an extending tail towards values associated to a
weak effect. We provide for the first time observational evidence for an
evolution in the asymmetry of the PESD with redshift. Adopting the modal values

decompose the observed photoionization rate into two major contributors: quasar

reported for many of these ULXs at about 0.2 keV seems to roughly follow a
trend Lsoft \propto T^{-3.5} when modelled with a power-law plus a `cool' MCD
model. This is contrary to the L \propto T^4 relation that is expected from
theory and what is seen for many accreting BHBs. The observed trend could
instead arise from disc emission beamed by an outflowing wind around a about 10
solar mass black hole.

find, using data from Epic-PN Camera on-board XMM-Newton observatory,that the
iron K_alpha emission line in GK Per has a noticeable red-skewed profile. We
compare the GK Per asymmetric line with the red-skewed lines observed by
XMM-Newton in Serpens X-1 and GX 339-4. The observation of the K_alpha emission
with red-skewed features in CV GK Per cannot be related to the redshift effects
of General Relativity (GR). Therefore, if the mechanism of the K_alpha-line
formation is the same in CVs, NSs and BHs then it is evident that the GR
effects would be ruled out as a cause of red skewness of K_alpha line. The line
reprocessing in an outflowing wind has been recently suggested an alternative
model for a broad red-shifted iron line formation. In the framework of the
outflow scenario the red-skewed iron line is formed in the strong extended wind
due to its illumination by the radiation emanating from the innermost part of
the accreting material. In this Paper we demonstrate that the asymmetric shapes
of the lines detected from these CV, NS and BH sources are well described with
the wind (outflow) model. While this fact is hard to reconcile with the
relativistic models, it is consistent with the outflowing gas washing out high
frequency modulations of the radiation presumably originated in the innermost

for four parameters, black hole mass, dark halo core radius, dark halo circular
velocity, and stellar mass-to-light ratio. We find a black hole mass of
6.4(+-0.5)x10^9 Msun(the uncertainty is 68% confidence marginalized over the
other parameters). The stellar M/L_V=6.3+-0.8. The best-fitted dark halo core
radius is 14+-2 kpc, assuming a cored logarithmic potential. The best-fitted
dark halo circular velocity is 715+-15 km/s. Our black hole mass is over a
factor of 2 larger than previous stellar dynamical measures, and our derived
stellar M/L ratio is 2 times lower than previous dynamical measures. When we do
not include a dark halo, we measure a black hole mass and stellar M/L ratio
that is consistent with previous measures, implying that the major difference
is in the model assumptions. The stellar M/L ratio from our models is very
similar to that derived from stellar population models of M87. The reason for
the difference in the black hole mass is because we allow the M/L ratio to
change with radius. The dark halo is degenerate with the stellar M/L ratio,
which is subsequently degenerate with the black hole mass. We argue that
dynamical models of galaxies that do not include the contribution from a dark
halo may produce a biased result for the black hole mass. This bias is
especially large for a galaxy with a shallow light profile such as M87, and may
not be as severe in galaxies with steeper light profiles unless they have a
large stellar population change with radius.

a major puzzle for broader astrophysics topics, as it is dominated by a bright
and extended apparently spherical emission region centered in the Galaxy's
center. Only recently has the disk of the Galaxy been detected with SPI. This
may be regarded as confirmation of earlier expectations that positrons should
arise predominantly from sources of nucleosynthesis distributed throughout the
plane of the Galaxy, which produce proton-rich unstable isotopes. But there are
other plausible sources of positrons, among them pulsars and accreting binaries
such as microquasars. SPI results may be interpreted also as hints that these
are more significant as positron sources on the Galactic scale than thought
before, in the plane and therefore also in the bulge of the Galaxy. This is

central region in the Galaxy, which otherwise also could be interpreted as a
first rather direct detection of dark matter annihilations in the Galaxy's

equilibrium distribution of wealth is explicitly calculated and its shape
crucially depends on market incompleteness. In particular, a Paretian law in
the top tail only arises if capital markets are incomplete. The Pareto exponent
depends on the saving rate, on the net return on capital, on the growth rate of

characteristics of the labour market mostly affects the bottom tail of the
