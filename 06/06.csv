solution, which requires a carefully regulated discrete sum of wedge states
subtracted against a mysterious ""phantom"" counter term, this new solution
involves a continuous integral of wedge states, and no regularization or
phantom term is necessary. Moreover, we can evaluate the action and prove Sen's
conjecture in a mere few lines of calculation.

galaxy number counts from confusion limited observations by the Balloon-borne
Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (BLAST). Our method is based on a
maximum likelihood fit to the pixel histogram, sometimes called 'P(D)', an
approach which has been used before to probe faint counts, the difference being
that here we advocate its use even for sources with relatively high
signal-to-noise ratios. This method has an advantage over standard techniques
of source extraction in providing an unbiased estimate of the counts from the
bright end down to flux densities well below the confusion limit. We
specifically analyse BLAST observations of a roughly 10 sq. deg. map centered
on the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey South (GOODS-S) field. We
provide estimates of number counts at the three BLAST wavelengths, 250, 350,
and 500 microns; instead of counting sources in flux bins we estimate the
counts at several flux density nodes connected with power-laws. We observe a
generally very steep slope for the counts of about -3.7 at 250 microns and -4.5
at 350 and 500 microns, over the range ~0.02-0.5 Jy, breaking to a shallower
slope below about 0.015 Jy at all three wavelengths. We also describe how to
estimate the uncertainties and correlations in this method so that the results
can be used for model-fitting. This method should be well-suited for analysis
of data from the Herschel satellite.

strongly constrains the set of quantum field theories which can be coupled

supersymmetric gauge theories coupled to gravity, the anomaly cancellation
conditions are equivalent to tadpole cancellation and other constraints on the
matter content of heterotic/type I compactifications on K3. In these cases, all
consistent 6D supergravity theories have a realization in string theory. We
find one example which may arise from a novel string compactification, and we
identify a new infinite family of models satisfying anomaly factorization. We
find, however, that this infinite family of models, as well as other infinite
families of models previously identified by Schwarz are pathological. We
suggest that it may be feasible to demonstrate that there is a string theoretic
realization of all consistent six-dimensional supergravity theories which have
Lagrangian descriptions with arbitrary gauge and matter content. We attempt to
frame this hypothesis of string universality as a concrete conjecture.

galaxies with a detailed treatment of chemical evolution and cooling. The
resulting galaxies have properties compatible with observations: relatively
high disk-to-total ratios, thin stellar disks and good agreement with the
Tully-Fisher and the luminosity-size relations. They present a break in the
luminosity profile at 3.0 +- 0.5 disk scale lengths, while showing an
exponential mass profile without any apparent breaks, in line with recent
observational results. Since the stellar mass profile is exponential, only
differences in the stellar populations can be the cause of the luminosity
break. Although we find a cutoff for the star formation rate imposed by a
density threshold in our star formation model, it does not coincide with the
luminosity break and is located at 4.3 +- 0.4 disk scale lengths, with star
formation going on between both radii. The color profiles and the age profiles
are ""U-shaped"", with the minimum for both profiles located approximately at the
break radius. The SFR to stellar mass ratio increases until the break,
explaining the coincidence of the break with the minimum of the age profile.
Beyond the break we find a steep decline in the gas density and, consequently,
a decline in the SFR and redder colors. We show that most stars (64-78%) in the
outer disk originate in the inner disk and afterwards migrate there. Such
stellar migrations are likely the main origin of the U-shaped age profile and,
therefore, of the luminosity break.

  ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is the LHC experiment dedicated to
the study of the QGP. Its large acceptance and low magnetic field make it

magnetic fields via the Hanle effect. According to standard theory the Hanle
effect should only be operating in the Doppler core of spectral lines but not
in the wings. In contrast, our observations of the scattering polarization in
the Ca {\sc i} 4227 \AA line reveals the existence of spatial variations of the
scattering polarization throughout the far line wings. This raises the question
whether the observed spatial variations in wing polarization have a magnetic or
non-magnetic origin. A magnetic origin may be possible if elastic collisions
are able to cause sufficient frequency redistribution to make the Hanle effect
effective in the wings without causing excessive collisional depolarization, as
suggested by recent theories for partial frequency redistribution with coherent
scattering in magnetic fields. To model the wing polarization we apply an
extended version of the technique based on the ""last scattering approximation"".
This model is highly successful in reproducing the observed Stokes $Q/I$
polarization (linear polarization parallel to the nearest solar limb),
including the location of the wing polarization maxima and the minima around
the Doppler core, but it fails to reproduce the observed spatial variations of
the wing polarization in terms of magnetic field effects with frequency
redistribution. This null result points in the direction of a non-magnetic
origin in terms of local inhomogeneities (varying collisional depolarization,
radiation-field anisotropies, and deviations from a plane-parallel atmospheric
stratification).

use a density-based definition of ICL, where ICL consists of luminous particles
which are at low densities, to identify ICL particles and track their
evolution. We have implemented a friends-of-friends-type clustering algorithm
which finds groups of particles correlated in both position and velocity space
to identify substructures in the ICL, hereafter referred to as ``streams''. We
find that ~40% of the cluster's ICL is generated in the form of these massive
(M > 7.0x10^8 Msun), dynamically cold streams. The fraction of the ICL
generated in streams is greater early in the cluster's evolution, when galaxies
are interacting in the group environment, than later in its evolution when the
massive cluster potential has been assembled. The production of streams
requires the strong tidal fields associated with close interactions between
pairs of galaxies, and is usually associated with merging pairs of galaxies, or
fast, close encounters with the cluster's central galaxy. Once streams are
formed, they begin to decay as they are disrupted by the tidal field of the
cluster. We find that streams have decay timescales which are ~1.5 times their
dynamical time in the cluster.

time-delayed coupling on stochastic resonance over scale-free neuronal
networks. As the two extreme options, we introduce the pacemaker respectively
to the neuron with the highest degree and to one of the neurons with the lowest
degree within the network, but we also consider the case when all neurons are
exposed to the periodic forcing. In the absence of delay, we show that an
intermediate intensity of noise is able to optimally assist the pacemaker in
imposing its rhythm on the whole ensemble, irrespective to its placing, thus
providing evidences for stochastic resonance on the scale-free neuronal
networks. Interestingly thereby, if the forcing in form of a periodic pulse
train is introduced to all neurons forming the network, the stochastic
resonance decreases as compared to the case when only a single neuron is paced.
Moreover, we show that finite delays in coupling can significantly affect the
stochastic resonance on scale-free neuronal networks. In particular,
appropriately tuned delays can induce multiple stochastic resonances
independently of the placing of the pacemaker, but they can also altogether
destroy stochastic resonance. Delay-induced multiple stochastic resonances
manifest as well-expressed maxima of the correlation measure, appearing at
every multiple of the pacemaker period. We argue that fine-tuned delays and
locally active pacemakers are vital for assuring optimal conditions for
stochastic resonance on complex neuronal networks.

cornerstone in modern cosmology. Inflation has passed a series of rigorous
experimental tests, but we still do not understand the physical mechanism or

can provide certain insights into inflationary physics is a background of
primordial gravitational waves. These perturbations leave a distinct signature
in the CMB B-modes of polarization. The EPIC (Experimental Probe of

mission concepts to carry out a definitive measurement of the inflationary
B-mode polarization spectrum. In this report we study a mission with an
aperture intermediate between the two missions discussed in our previous

than the small EPIC-Low Cost mission. In addition to the search for
inflationary gravitational waves, the increase aperture allows us to mine the
scale polarization and lensing shear polarization signals down to cosmological
limits, so that we extract virtually all the cosmological information available
from the CMB. In addition, a modest number of channels operating at higher
frequencies allows for an all-sky measurement of polarized Galactic dust, which
will provide a rich dataset for Galactic science related to magnetic fields.
Using a combination of a large sensitivity focal plane with a new optical
design, and an efficient 4K mechanical cooler, EPIC-IM realizes higher

haloes as well as accretion of ""diffuse"" non-halo material. We quantify the
mass growth rates via these two processes, dM_mer/dt and dM_dif/dt, and their
dependence on halo environment using the ~500,000 haloes in the Millennium
simulation. Adopting a local mass density parameter as a measure of halo
environment, we find the two rates show strong but opposite environmental
dependence, with mergers playing an increasingly important role for halo
growths in overdense regions and diffuse accretion dominating growth in voids.
This behaviour is independent of the mass cuts used to define haloes vs
non-haloes. For galaxy-scale haloes, these two opposite correlations largely
cancel out, but a weak environmental dependence remains that results in a
slightly lower mean total growth rate, and hence an earlier mean formation
redshift, for haloes in denser regions. The mean formation redshift of the
~5000 cluster-mass haloes, on the other hand, appears to have no correlation
with halo environment. The origin of the positive correlation of dM_mer/dt with
local density can be traced to the surrounding mass reservoir outside the
haloes, where more progenitor haloes are available in denser regions. The
negative correlation of dM_dif/dt with density, however, is not explained by
the available diffuse mass in the reservoir, which is in fact larger in denser
regions. The non-halo component may therefore be partially comprised of truly
diffuse dark matter particles that are dynamically hotter and are accreted at a
suppressed rate in denser regions. We also discuss the implications of these
results for how to modify the Extended Press-Schechter model of halo growth,
which in its original form does not predict environmental dependence.

traced by the dark matter and halos, using a combination of perturbation theory
and N-body simulations. We confirm that the acoustic peak traced by the dark
matter is both broadened and shifted as structure forms, and that this shift is
well described by second-order perturbation theory. These shifts persist for
dark matter halos, and are a simple function of halo bias, with the shift
(mostly) increasing with increasing bias. Extending our perturbation theory
results to halos with simple two parameter bias models (both in Lagrangian and
Eulerian space) quantitatively explains the observed shifts. In particular, we
demonstrate that there are additional terms that contribute to the shift that
are absent for the matter. At z=0 for currently favored cosmologies, the matter
shows shifts of ~0.5%, b=1 halos shift the acoustic scale by ~0.2%, while b=2
halos shift it by ~0.5%; these shifts decrease by the square of the growth
factor at higher redshifts. These results are easily generalized to galaxies
within the halo model, where we show that simple galaxy models show marginally
larger shifts than the correspondingly biased halos, due to the contribution of
satellites in high mass halos. While our focus here is on real space, our
results make specific predictions for redshift space. For currently favored
cosmological models, we find that the shifts for halos at z=0 increase by
~0.3%; at high z, they increase by ~0.5% D^2. Our results demonstrate that
these theoretical systematics are smaller than the statistical precision of
upcoming surveys, even if one ignored the corrections discussed here. Simple
modeling, along the lines discussed here, has the potential to reduce these
systematics to below the levels of cosmic variance limited surveys.

of fast Lax, intermediate (overcompressive), or slow Lax type; however, the
shock layer is independent of magnetic field, consisting of a purely

consistent with a same sign for magnetic helicity. We present a
multi-wavelength analysis of an M1.6 flare occurring in the active region NOAA
10365 on 27 May, 2003, in which a large new bipole emerges in a decaying active
region. The diverging flow pattern and the ""tongue"" shape of the magnetic field
in the photosphere with elongated polarities are highly suggestive of the
emergence of a twisted flux tube. The orientation of these tongues indicates
the emergence of a flux tube with a right hand twist, i.e. positive magnetic
helicity. The flare signatures in the chromosphere are ribbons observed in
H-alpha by the MSDP spectrograph in the Meudon solar tower and in 1600 A by
TRACE. These ribbons have a `J' shape and are shifted along the inversion line.
The pattern of these ribbons suggests that the flare was triggered by magnetic
reconnection at coronal heights below a twisted flux tube of positive helicity,
corresponding to that of the observed emergence. It is the first time that such
a consistency between the signatures of the emerging flux through the
photosphere and flare ribbons is clearly identified in observations. Another
type of ribbons observed during the flare at the periphery of the active region
by the MSDP and SOHO/EIT are related to the existence of a null point, which is
found high in the corona in a potential field extrapolation. We discuss the
interpretation of these secondary brightenings in terms of the ""breakout"" model

radio and X-ray pulsar PSR J0205+6449 located in the Galactic supernova remnant
3C 58. Data in the gamma-ray band were acquired by the Large Area Telescope
aboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (formerly GLAST), while the radio
rotational ephemeris used to fold gamma-rays was obtained using both the Green
Bank Telescope and the Lovell telescope at Jodrell Bank. The light curve
consists of two peaks separated by 0.49 +/- 0.01 +/- 0.01 cycles which are
aligned with the X-ray peaks. The first gamma-ray peak trails the radio pulse
by 0.08 +/- 0.01 +/- 0.01, while its amplitude decreases with increasing energy
as for the other gamma-ray pulsars. Spectral analysis of the pulsed gamma-ray
emission suggests a simple power law of index -2.1 +/- 0.1 +/- 0.2 with an
exponential cut-off at 3.0 +1.1 -0.7 +/- 0.4 GeV. The first uncertainty is
statistical and the second is systematic. The integral gamma-ray photon flux
above 0.1 GeV is (13.7 +/- 1.4 +/- 3.0) x 10^(-8) /cm2/s, which implies for a
distance of 3.2 kpc and assuming a broad fan-like beam a luminosity of 8.3 x
10^(34) ergs/s and an efficiency eta of 0.3%. Finally, we report a 95% upper
limit on the flux of 1.7 x 10^(-8) /cm2/s for off-pulse emission from the
object.

first general-purpose scheme that can catch all cheaters, even when cheaters
collude. The main idea of this algorithm might at first seem
counter-intuitive--we have the participants check each other's work. A naive
implementation of this approach would, of course, be susceptible to collusion
attacks, but we show that by, adapting efficient solutions to the parallel
processor diagnosis problem, we can tolerate collusions of lazy cheaters, even
if the number of such cheaters is a fraction of the total number of

of patches have to obey when the patches are computed by local averaging. These
relations restrict the choice of reparameterizations for geometric continuity.
In particular, when one bicubic tensor-product B-spline patch is associated
with each facet of a quadrilateral mesh with n-valent vertices and we do not
want segments of the boundary curves forced to be linear, then the relations
dictate the minimal number and multiplicity of knots: For general data, the
tensor-product spline patches must have at least two internal double knots per
edge to be able to model a G^1-conneced complex of C^1 splines. This lower
bound on the complexity of any construction is proven to be sharp by suitably
interpreting an existing surface construction. That is, we have a tight bound
on the complexity of smoothing quad meshes with bicubic tensor-product B-spline
patches.

relativistic heavy ion collider (RHIC) in the form of single-particle spectra
and correlations seems to indicate that a dense QCD medium nearly opaque to
partons, a strongly-coupled quark-gluon plasma (sQGP), is formed in
more-central Au-Au collisions, and that the sQGP may have a very small
viscosity (""perfect liquid""). Measurements of radial and elliptic flows, with
possible coalescence of ""constituent quarks"" to form hadrons, seem to support
the conclusion. However, other measurements provide contradictory evidence.
Unbiased angular correlations indicate that a large number of back-to-back jets
from initial-state scattered partons with energies as low as 3 GeV survive as
""minijet"" hadron correlations even in central Au-Au collisions, suggesting near
transparency. Two-component analysis of single-particle hadron spectra reveals
a corresponding spectrum hard component (parton fragment distribution described
by pQCD) which can masquerade as ""radial flow"" in some spectrum analysis.
Reinterpretation of ""elliptic flow"" as a QCD scattering process resulting in
fragmentation is also possible. In this paper I review analysis methods and
results in the context of two paradigms: the conventional
hydrodynamics/hard-probes paradigm and an alternative quadrupole/minijets
paradigm. Based on re-interpretation of fiducial data I argue that
hydrodynamics may not be relevant to RHIC collisions. Collision evolution may
be dominated by parton scattering and fragmentation, albeit the fragmentation
process is strongly modified in more-central A-A collisions.

cost function that does not vanish on the diagonal. The latest is similar to

the puzzle of why $\theta_{qcd}$ is so small with the puzzle of why the PQ

raise further puzzles. This paper explores this issues in several contexts:
string theory and field theory, and theories without and with low energy
supersymmetry. Among the questions studied are whether requiring axion dark
matter can account for the quality of the PQ symmetry, to which the answer is
sometimes yes. In non-supersymmetric theories, we find $f_a = 10^{12}$ GeV is
quite plausible. In gauge mediation, cosmological constraints on pseudomoduli
place $f_a$ in this range, and require that the gravitino mass be of order an
MeV.

reflection-diffraction process, and then a self-similar reflected shock moves
outward as the original shock moves forward in time. The complexity of
reflection-diffraction configurations was first reported by Ernst Mach in 1878,
and experimental, computational, and asymptotic analysis has shown that various
patterns of shock reflection-diffraction configurations may occur, including
regular reflection and Mach reflection. In this paper we start with various
shock reflection-diffraction phenomena, their fundamental scientific issues,
and their theoretical roles as building blocks and asymptotic attractors of
general solutions in the mathematical theory of multidimensional hyperbolic
systems of conservation laws. Then we describe how the global problem of shock
reflection-diffraction by a wedge can be formulated as a free boundary problem
for nonlinear conservation laws of mixed-composite hyperbolic-elliptic type.
Finally we discuss some recent developments in attacking the shock
reflection-diffraction problem, including the existence, stability, and
regularity of global regular reflection-diffraction solutions. The approach
includes techniques to handle free boundary problems, degenerate elliptic
equations, and corner singularities, which is highly motivated by experimental,
computational, and asymptotic results. Further trends and open problems in this
direction are also addressed.

the electron count in the molecular orbital (MO) of the V4-cluster gradually

ordering around x <= 0.5. Remarkably, the low temperature structural phase
transitions as known from the ternary compounds were also detected in the solid

in the final stages of their evolution by means of stellar winds. Since they
are large in number, they contribute significantly to the cosmic matter cycle.
To assess this contribution quantitatively, it is crucial to obtain a detailed
picture of the stellar interior, particularly with regard to nucleosynthesis
and mixing mechanisms. We seek to benchmark stellar evolutionary models of
low-mass stars. In particular, we measure the surface abundance of ^{12}C in
thermally pulsing AGB stars with well-known mass and metallicity, which can be
used to infer information about the onset and efficiency of the third
dredge-up. We recorded high-resolution near-infrared spectra of AGB stars in
the LMC cluster NGC 1978. The sample comprised both oxygen-rich and carbon-rich
stars, and is well-constrained in terms of the stellar mass, metallicity, and
age. We derived the C/O and ^{12}C/^{13}C ratio from the target spectra by a
comparison to synthetic spectra. Then, we compared the outcomes of stellar
evolutionary models with our measurements. The M stars in NGC 1978 show values
of C/O and ^{12}C/^{13}C that can best be explained with moderate extra-mixing
on the RGB coupled to a moderate oxygen enhancement in the chemical
composition. These oxygen-rich stars do not seem to have undergone third
dredge-up episodes (yet). The C stars show carbon-to-oxygen and carbon isotopic
ratios consistent with the occurrence of the third dredge-up. We did not find S
stars in this cluster. None of the theoretical schemes that we considered was
able to reproduce the observations appropriately. Instead, we discuss some
non-standard scenarios to explain the puzzling abundance pattern in NGC 1978.
