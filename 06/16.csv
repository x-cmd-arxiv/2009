chemicals across their diameters, allowing the cells to move towards or away
from chemical sources. This chemotactic ability relies on the remarkable
capacity of cells to infer gradients from particles randomly arriving at
cell-surface receptors by diffusion. Whereas the physical limits of
concentration sensing by cells have been explored, there is no theory for the
physical limits of gradient sensing. Here, we derive such a theory, using as
models a perfectly absorbing sphere and a perfectly monitoring sphere, which,
respectively, infer gradients from the absorbed surface particle density or the
positions of freely diffusing particles inside a spherical volume. We find that
the perfectly absorbing sphere is superior to the perfectly monitoring sphere,
both for concentration and gradient sensing, since previously observed
particles are never remeasured. The superiority of the absorbing sphere helps
explain the presence at the surfaces of cells of signal degrading enzymes, such
as PDE for cAMP in Dictyostelium discoideum (Dicty) and BAR1 for mating factor
alpha in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast). Quantitatively, our theory
compares favorably to recent measurements of Dicty moving up a cAMP gradient,
suggesting these cells operate near the physical limits of gradient detection.

single use is not able to transmit classical information perfectly yet two uses
can. This is achieved by employing entangled input states between different
uses of the given channel and thus cannot happen for classical channels. Second
we exhibit a class of quantum channel with vanishing zero-error classical
capacity such that when a noiseless qubit channel or one ebit shared
entanglement are available, it can be used to transmit $\log_2 d$ noiseless
qubits, where 2d is the dimension of input state space. Third we further
construct quantum channels with vanishing zero-error classical capacity when
assisted with classical feedback can be used to transmit both classical and
quantum information perfectly. These striking findings not only indicate both
the zero-error quantum and classical capacities of quantum channels satisfy a
strong super-additivity beyond any classical channels, but also highlight the
activation power of auxiliary physical resources in zero-error communication.

sequence of efficiently solvable semidefinite programs. We apply this method to
derive arbitrarily good approximations to the optimal measure-and-prepare

performance in combination with the criterion developed by Doherty et al. [1]

quantum states whose separability properties were unknown.

objects (AQ Men, V433 Ara) we can only assess a lower limit for the WD
temperature or mass accretion rate. NSV 10934 was caught in a quiescent state
and its spectrum is consistent with a low mass accretion rate disk. For 5
objects (HP Nor, DT Aps, AM Cas, FO Per and ES Dra) we obtain WD temperatures
between 34,000K and 40,000K and/or mass accretion rates consistent with
intermediate to outburst states. These temperatures reflect the heating of the
WD due to on-going accretion and are similar to the temperatures of other DNs
observed on the rise to, and in decline from outburst. The WD Temperatures we
obtain should therefore be considered as upper limits, and it is likely that
during quiescence AM Cas, FO Per and ES Dra are near the average WD Teff for
catalcysmic variables above the period gap (30,000K), similar to U Gem, SS Aur
and RX And.

  arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:0906.1752",,,,"astro-ph.CO astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A non-cosmological origin for the CMB low-order multipoles and associated
anomalies is suggested in this paper. We discuss the possibility that these
features of the power spectrum originate in the termination shock (TS) region
of the heliosheath that surrounds the solar system. If the intrinsic CMB
spectrum is assumed to be a pure monopole (2.73K) then thermal processes
occurring within an ellipsoidal-shaped plasma region of the TS region could
imprint the observed low-order multipoles and their alignment (so-called 'axis
of exil') onto this background CMB. A key requirement of the model is that the
TS plasma be characterized as an optically thin graybody with non-LTE
perturbations to explain both the blackbody and non-blackbody anomalies.
Non-thermal TS processes are also discussed. TS synchrotron radiation is shown
as a possible cause for the reported ARCADE 2 CMB distortion. Magnetoacoustic
oscillations and heliosheath turbulence are suggested as possible sources for
the higher-order multipole moments of the CMB. Data from the ongoing Voyager
missions is critical to this study. Research problems are identified for future
work to better validate the heuristic models presented here.

2006.39, respectively. These interplanetary events have been followed outward
from the Sun using plasma and cosmic ray data from Ulysses and Voyagers 1 and
2. For both intervals of kHz emissions, events originating near the Sun that
turn out to be the most intense events in this 11-year solar cycle as observed
by the plasma and cosmic ray variations in the outer heliosphere, reach V1 and
V2 which are near the heliospheric termination shock at almost the same time
that the two kHz radio emissions turn-on. These two events which originate near
the Sun about 2003.89 (the 2003 Halloween event) and at 2005.71, are also
unusual in that they develop solar wind ram pressure waves in the outer
heliosphere with maximum pressures ~6-8 times the average solar wind pressure
when they reach the heliospheric termination shock. We believe that this study
suggests a possible new paradigm for the origin of these latest kHz emissions.
This new paradigm is different from the current one describing earlier kHz
events. It is related to the strength of these pressure waves in the outer
heliosphere and involves the arrival of these large pressure waves at the
heliospheric termination shock rather than the arrival of a shock at the
heliopause as is the current paradigm.

of Voronoi diagrams with different properties by providing implementations for
a vast collection of commonly used Voronoi diagrams. We also show how to apply
the new framework and other existing tools from CGAL to compute minimum-width
annuli of sets of disks, which requires the computation of two Voronoi diagrams
of two different types, and of the overlay of the two diagrams. We do not

(SDW) phase at low temperatures. Progress in understanding this SDW state has
been complicated by a complex band structure and by the fact that the spin,
electronic, and structural degrees of freedom are closely intertwined in these
compounds. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements have added to this
complexity by revealing different topographies with no consensus on the surface
structure. In this paper, we use a combination of high-resolution STM imaging
and spectroscopy, and low energy electron diffraction (LEED) to determine the
atomic and electronic structure of the parent pnictide SrFe2As2. Our data
present a compelling picture of the existence of two coexisting homotopic
structures on the surface. Based on this, we construct a simple model for the
surface, which offers an explanation of the two classes of topographies seen by
STM. STM spectroscopy shows that while the high energy density of states (DOS)
profile is consistent with the Fe 3d and As 4p-electrons predicted by LDA it is
in better agreement with calculations that include electron correlations beyond
LDA. Importantly, we find a gap of ~15 meV in the low energy density of states
on both structures which may be linked with the SDW or the observed surface
reconstruction.

a pronounced curvature near the wall and the absolute value of the negative

length increases rapidly as a function of shear rate. The gradual transition
from no-slip to steady-state slip flow is associated with faster relaxation of

autocorrelation function of the first normal mode. We also show that at high
melt densities the friction coefficient at the interface between the polymer

the product of the surface induced peak in the structure factor, temperature

characterized by dense equatorial disks of gas that have been inferred to orbit
with Keplerian velocities. Although these disks seem to be ejected from the
star and not accreted, there is substantial observational evidence to show that
the stars rotate more slowly than required for centrifugally driven mass loss.
This paper develops an idea (proposed originally by Hiroyasu Ando and
colleagues) that nonradial stellar pulsations inject enough angular momentum
into the upper atmosphere to spin up a Keplerian disk. The pulsations
themselves are evanescent in the stellar photosphere, but they may be unstable
to the generation of resonant oscillations at the acoustic cutoff frequency. A
detailed theory of the conversion from pulsations to resonant waves does not
yet exist for realistic hot-star atmospheres, so the current models depend on a
parameterized approximation for the efficiency of wave excitation. Once
resonant waves have been formed, however, they grow in amplitude with
increasing height, steepen into shocks, and exert radial and azimuthal Reynolds
stresses on the mean fluid. Using reasonable assumptions for the stellar
parameters, these processes were found to naturally create the inner boundary
conditions required for dense Keplerian disks, even when the underlying B-star
photosphere is rotating as slowly as 60% of its critical rotation speed.
Because there is evidence for long-term changes in Be-star pulsational
properties, this model may also account for the long-term variability of Be
stars, including transitions between normal, Be, and shell phases.

attracted considerable attention as it suggests that massive galaxies have
grown by a factor of ~five in size over the past ten billion years. A key test
of these results is a determination of the stellar kinematics of one of the
compact galaxies: if the sizes of these objects are as extreme as has been
claimed, their stars are expected to have much higher velocities than those in
present-day galaxies of the same mass. Here we report a measurement of the
stellar velocity dispersion of a massive compact galaxy at redshift z=2.186,
corresponding to a look-back time of 10.7 billion years. The velocity
dispersion is very high at 510 (+165, -95) km/s, consistent with the mass and
compactness of the galaxy inferred from photometric data and indicating
significant recent structural and dynamical evolution of massive galaxies. The
uncertainty in the dispersion was determined from simulations which include the
effects of noise and template mismatch. However, we caution that some subtle

including two super-Earths planets which straddle its habitable zone. We report
here the detection of an additional planet -- GJ 581e -- with a minimum mass of
1.9 M_earth. With a period of 3.15 days, it is the innermost planet of the
system and has a ~5% transit probability. We also correct our previous
confusion of the orbital period of GJ 581d (the outermost planet) with a
one-year alias, thanks to an extended time span and many more measurements. The
revised period is 66.8 days, and locates the semi-major axis inside the
habitable zone of the low mass star. The dynamical stability of the 4-planet
system imposes an upper bound on the orbital plane inclination. The planets
cannot be more massive than approximately 1.6 times their minimum mass.

Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) and Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) in current and
future surveys based on cosmological N-body simulations which adequately
describe the nonlinear growth of structure on small scales and compare to
linear theory. We find that the probability distribution of the LBG abundance
is skewed toward low values since the narrow transverse dimension of the survey
is more likely to probe underdense regions. Over a range that spans 1--2 orders
of magnitude in galaxy luminosities, the variance in the number of objects
differs from the commonly used analytic prediction and is not dominated by
Poisson noise. Additionally, nonlinear bias on small scales results in a
one-dimensional power spectrum of LAEs using a James Webb Space Telescope
field-of-view that is relatively flat, markedly different from the expectation
of linear perturbation theory. We discuss how these results may affect attempts
to measure the UV background at high redshifts, estimate the relationship
between halo mass and galaxy luminosity, and probe reionization by measuring
the power-modulating effect of ionized regions.

torus embedded in a large scale vertical magnetic field orbiting a

vertical field evolves within a turbulent accretion disk and whether global
magnetic field configurations suitable for launching jets and winds can
develop. We find that a ""coronal mechanism"" of magnetic flux motion, which
operates largely outside the disk body, dominates global flux evolution. In
this mechanism, magnetic stresses driven by orbital shear create large-scale
half-loops of magnetic field that stretch radially inward and then reconnect,
leading to discontinuous jumps in the location of magnetic flux. In contrast,
little or no flux is brought in directly by accretion within the disk itself.
The coronal mechanism establishes a dipole magnetic field in the evacuated
funnel around the orbital axis with a field intensity regulated by a
combination of the magnetic and gas pressures in the inner disk. These results
prompt a reevaluation of previous descriptions of magnetic flux motion
associated with accretion. Local pictures are undercut by the intrinsically
global character of magnetic flux. Formulations in terms of an ""effective
viscosity"" competing with an ""effective resistivity"" are undermined by the
nonlinearity of of the magnetic dynamics and the fact that the same turbulence

the cumulative angular momentum profiles of hundreds of thousands of haloes in
the Millennium simulation and in a smaller, but higher resolution, simulation,
in total spanning 5 orders of magnitude in mass. For haloes of a given mass,
the median specific angular momentum increases as j(<r) proportional to r. The
direction of the vector varies considerably with radius: the median angle
between the inner (< 0.25 Rvir) and total (< Rvir) angular momentum vectors is
about 25degr. To investigate how baryons affect halo spin, we use another high
resolution simulation, which includes gas cooling, star formation and feedback.
This simulation produces a sample of galaxies with a realistic distribution of
disc-to-total ratios. The formation of the galaxy spins up the dark matter
within 0.1 Rvir such that the specific halo angular momentum increases by
approx 50% in the median. The dark matter angular momentum becomes better
aligned, but there remains a broad distribution of (mis-)alignments between the
halo and the central galaxy, with a median angle between their angular momenta
of ~ 30degr. Galaxies have a range of orientations relative to the shape of the
halo: half of them have their minor axes misaligned by more than 45degr.
Finally, we align a sample of haloes according to the orientation of their
galaxies and stack the projected mass distributions. Although the individual
haloes are aspherical, galaxy--halo misalignments produce a stacked mass
distribution that is indistinguishable from circular. If the misalignment found
in our simulations is realistic, it will be extremely difficult for weak
lensing studies to measure the shape of dark haloes using this technique.

interplay between isotropic and anisotropic hyperfine interactions. By using
only analytical methods, we are able to show how the interaction strength
depends on important physical parameters, such as curvature and isotope
abundances. We show that for the investigated carbon structures, the 13C
hyperfine coupling strength is less than 1 mu-eV, and that the associated
electron-spin decoherence time can be expected to be several tens of
microseconds or longer, depending on the abundance of spin-carrying 13C nuclei.
Furthermore, we find that the hyperfine-induced Knight shift is highly
anisotropic, both in graphene and in nanotubes of arbitrary chirality.

past Hubble sequence that can be causally linked to the present-day one. We
selected samples of nearby galaxies from the SDSS and of distant galaxies from
the GOODS survey. We verified that each sample is representative of galaxies.
We further showed that the observational conditions necessary to retrieve their
morphological classification are similar in an unbiased way. Morphological
analysis has been done in an identical way for all galaxies in the two samples.
We found an absence of number evolution for elliptical and lenticular galaxies,
which strikingly contrasts with the strong evolution of spiral and peculiar
galaxies. Spiral galaxies were 2.3 times less abundant in the past, that is
exactly compensated by the strong decrease by a factor 5 of peculiar galaxies.
It strongly suggests that more than half of the present-day spirals had
peculiar morphologies, 6 Gyrs ago, and this has to be accounted by any scenario
of galactic disk evolution and formation. The past Hubble sequence can be used
to test these scenarios as well as to test evolution of fundamental planes for
spirals and bulges.

area of ~0.7 square degrees inside the COSMOS field, with accurate photometric
redshifts (i < 26.5 and dz/(z+1) ~ 0.035). We estimate galaxy stellar masses by
fitting the multi-color photometry to a grid of composite stellar population
models. We quantitatively describe the galaxy morphology by fitting PSF
convolved Sersic profiles to the galaxy surface brightness distributions down
to F814 = 24 mag for a sample of 41300 objects.
  We confirm an evolution of the morphological mix with redshift: the higher
the redshift the more disk-dominated galaxies become important. We find that
the morphological mix is a function of the local comoving density: the
morphology density relation extends up to the highest redshift explored.
  The stellar mass function of disk-dominated galaxies is consistent with being
constant with redshift. Conversely, the stellar mass function of
bulge-dominated systems shows a decline in normalization with redshift. Such
different behaviors of late-types and early-types stellar mass functions
naturally set the redshift evolution of the transition mass. ABRIDGED

proper times and an extra variable in addition to those of space and time,
precisely and physically identified from experimental examples, together give a
physical justification for the `chronometric hypothesis' of general relativity.
Indeed, we show that, with a lack of these latter two ingredients, no clock
paradox solution exists in which the clock and message functions are solely at
the origin of the asymmetry. These proper times originate from a given
conformal structure of the spacetime when ascribing different compatible
projective structures to each Woodhouse particle, and then, each defines a
specific Weylian sheaf structure. In addition, the proper time
parameterizations, as two point functions, cannot be defined irrespective of
the processes in the relative changes of physical characteristics. These
processes are included via path-dependent conformal scale factors, which act
like sockets for any kind of physical interaction and also represent the values
of the variable associated with the extra dimension. As such, the differential
aging differs far beyond the first and second clock effects in Weyl geometries,
with the latter finally appearing to not be suitable.

framework that can explain the ubiquitous presence of the soft X-ray background
diffuse emission. We summarize the current knowledge on this local interstellar
region, paying particular reference to observations that sample emission from
the presumed local million degree K hot plasma. However, we have listed
numerous observations that are seemingly in conflict with the concept of a hot
Local Bubble. In particular, the discovery of solar wind charge exchange that
can generate an appreciable soft X-ray background signal within the
heliosphere, has led to a reassessment of the generally accepted model that
requires a hot local plasma. In order to explain the majority of observations
of the local plasma, we forward two new speculative models that describe the
physical state of the local interstellar gas. One possible scenario is similar
to the present widely accepted model of the Local Hot Bubble, except that it
accounts for only 50% of the soft X-ray emission currently detected in the
galactic plane, has a lower thermal pressure than previously thought, and its
hot plasma is not as hot as previously believed. Although such a model can
solve several difficulties with the traditional hot Local Bubble model, a
heating mechanism for the dimmer and cooler gas remains to be found. The second
possible explanation is that of the Hot Top model, in which the Local Cavity is
an old supernova remnant in which no (or very little) million degree local
plasma is presently required. Instead, the cavity is now thought to be filled
with partially ionized cloudlets of temperature 7000 K that are surrounded by
lower density envelopes of photoionized gas of temperature 20,000 K.

positive. For turbulent dynamos, this seems physically reasonable, since

interacting wave `clusters' consisting of finite number of connected wave
triads with exact three-wave resonances. We examine this phenomenon using the
example of atmospheric planetary (Rossby) waves. It is shown that the dynamics
of the clusters is determined by the types of connections between neighboring
triads within a cluster; these correspond to substantially different scenarios
of energy flux between different triads. All the possible cases of the energy
cascade termination are classified. Free and forced chaotic dynamics in the
clusters are investigated: due to the huge fluctuations of the energy exchange
between resonant triads these two types of evolution have a lot in common. It
is confirmed that finite-dimensional wave turbulence in finite wave systems is
fundamentally different from kinetic wave turbulence in infinite systems; the
latter is described by wave kinetic equations that account for interactions
with overlapping quasi-resonances of finite amplitude waves. The present
results are directly applicable to finite-dimensional wave turbulence in any

convergence of the mean Lya flux and flux power spectrum at z=5 are
significantly stricter than at lower redshift. This is because transmission in
the high redshift Lya forest is primarily due to underdense regions in the
intergalactic medium (IGM), and these are less well resolved compared to the
moderately overdense regions which dominate the Lya forest opacity at z~2-3. We
further find that the gas density distribution in our simulations differs
significantly from previous results in the literature at large overdensities
(\Delta>10). We conclude that studies of the Lya forest at z=5 using SPH
simulations require a gas particle mass of M_gas \leq 2x10^5 M_sol/h, which is
>8 times the value required at z=2. A box size of at least 40 Mpc/h is

heavy hole state with the Rashba spin-orbit coupling term depending on momentum
only cubically. The hole spin relaxation is investigated by means of the fully
microscopic kinetic spin Bloch equation approach, with all the relevant

weak, which makes the hole-hole Coulomb scattering become very important. The
hole system in Si/SiGe quantum wells is generally in the strong scattering
limit, while that in Ge/SiGe quantum wells can be in either the strong or the
weak scattering limit. The Coulomb scattering leads to a peak in both the
temperature and hole density dependences of spin relaxation time in Si/SiGe
quantum wells, located around the crossover between the degenerate and
nondegenerate regimes. Nevertheless, the Coulomb scattering leads to not only a
peak but also a valley in the temperature dependence of spin relaxation time in
Ge/SiGe quantum wells.... (The remaining is omitted due to the limit of space).

equation is solved by the use of stochastic unraveling in order to obtain
excitation profile and current in the steady state. Completely diffusive
transport is found for a range of model parameters, whereas signatures of
ballistic behavior are observed outside this range. In the diffusive regime the
conductivity is rather independent from the strength of the bath coupling and
quantitatively agrees with the diffusion coefficient which has been derived
from an investigation of the same model without baths. Also the ballistic

nebula (PN) NGC 7293 (the Helix Nebula) in the 2.12 micron H2 v=1-0 S(1) line.
The excellent seeing (0.4'') at the Subaru Telescope, allows the details of
cometary knots to be examined. The knots are found at distances of 2.2'-6.4'
from the central star (CS). At the inner edge and in the inner ring (up to 4.5'
fromthe CS), the knot often show a `tadpole' shape, an elliptical head with a
bright crescent inside and a long tail opposite to the CS. In detail, there are
variations in the tadpole shapes, such as narrowing tails, widening tails,
meandering tails, or multi-peaks within a tail. In the outer ring (4.5'-6.4'
from the CS), the shapes are more fractured, and the tails do not collimate
into a single direction. The transition in knot morphology from the inner edge
to the outer ring is clearly seen. The number density of knots governs the H2
surface brightness in the inner ring: H2 exists only within the knots. Possible
mechanisms which contribute to the shaping of the knots are discussed,
including photo-ionization and streaming motions. A plausible interpretation of
our images is that inner knots are being overrun by a faster wind, but that
this has not (yet) reached the outer knots. Based on H2 formation and
destruction rates, H2 gas can survive in knots from formation during the late
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase throughout the PN phase. These observations
provide new constraints on the formation and evolution of knots, and on the
physics of molecular gas embedded within ionized gas.

by Peres, Schramm, Sheffield, and Wilson. This new tug-of-war game is identical
to the original except near the boundary of the domain $\partial \Omega$, but
its associated value functions are more regular. The dynamic programming
principle implies that the value functions satisfy a certain finite difference
equation. By studying this difference equation directly and adapting techniques
from viscosity solution theory, we prove a number of new results. We show that
the finite difference equation has unique maximal and minimal solutions, which
are identified as the value functions for the two tug-of-war players. We
demonstrate uniqueness, and hence the existence of a value for the game, in the
case that the running payoff function is nonnegative. We also show that
uniqueness holds in certain cases for sign-changing running payoff functions
which are sufficiently small. In the limit $\epsilon \to 0$, we obtain the
convergence of the value functions to a viscosity solution of the normalized
infinity Laplace equation. We also obtain several new results for the
normalized infinity Laplace equation $-\Delta_\infty u = f$. In particular, we
demonstrate the existence of solutions to the Dirichlet problem for any bounded
continuous $f$, and continuous boundary data, as well as the uniqueness of
solutions to this problem in the generic case. We present a new elementary
proof of uniqueness in the case that $f>0$, $f< 0$, or $f\equiv 0$. The
stability of the solutions with respect to $f$ is also studied, and an explicit
continuous dependence estimate from $f\equiv 0$ is obtained.

activated dendritic cells possess the capacity to activate na\""ive T cells. In
the present study we demonstrated that immature dendritic cells secrete both
the YM1 lectin and lipocalin-2. By testing the ligands of these two proteins,
chitosan and siderophores, respectively, we also demonstrated that chitosan, a
degradation product of various fungal and protozoal cell walls, induces an
activation of dendritic cells at the membrane level, as shown by the
up-regulation of membrane proteins such as class II molecules, CD80 and CD86

This led to the production of activated dendritic cells unable to stimulate T
cells. However, costimulation with other microbial products overcame this
partial activation and restored the capacity of these activated dendritic cells
to stimulate T cells. In addition, successive stimulation with chitosan and
then by lipopolysaccharide induced a dose-dependent change in the cytokinic
IL-12/IL-10 balance produced by the dendritic cells.

abundance in the universe and the abundances observed in Pop II dwarfs and

undergone photospheric depletion of Li. To constrain the nature of such
depletion, we conduct a homogeneous analysis of a very large sample of stars in
the metal-poor globular cluster NGC6397, covering well all evolutionary phases
from below the main sequence turn-off to high up the red giant branch. Non-LTE
Li abundances or abundance upper limits are obtained for all stars, and for a
size-able sub-set of the targets also Na abundances are obtained. The sodium
abundances are used to distinguish stars formed out of pristine material from
stars formed out of material affected by pollution from a previous generation
of more massive stars. The dwarfs, turn-off, and early subgiant stars form a
thin abundance plateau, disrupted in the middle of the subgiant branch by the
lithium dilution caused by the first dredge-up. A second steep abundance drop
is seen at the red giant branch bump. The turn-off stars are more lithium-poor,
by up to 0.1 dex, than subgiants that have not yet undergone dredge-up. In
addition, hotter dwarfs are slightly more lithium-poor than cooler dwarfs,
which may be a signature of the so-called Li dip in the cluster, commonly seen
among PopI stars. A considerably large spread in Na abundance confirms that
NGC6397 has suffered from intra-cluster pollution in its infancy and a limited
number of Na-enhanced and Li-deficient stars strongly contribute to form a
significant anti-correlation between the abundances of Na and Li. The inferred
Li abundances are compared to predictions from stellar structure models
including atomic diffusion and ad-hoc turbulence below the convection zone.

spectrum, the correction to the Casimir energy is exponentially suppressed.
When a massless mode is present in the spectrum, the correction to the Casimir
energy can be, in principle, sizeable. Here we illustrate a new method to
compute the correction to the Casimir energy between two parallel plates,
localized on a brane. The Casimir energy is suppressed by two factors: at
lowest order in $\varepsilon$, the correction comes entirely from the massive
mode and turns out to be exponentially suppressed; the next-to-leading order
correction in $\varepsilon$ follows, instead, a power-law suppression due to
the small wave function overlap of the zero-mode with matter confined on the
visible brane. Generic comments on the constraints on new physics that may
arise from Casimir force experiments are also made.

observations of parts of the sample suggest a remarkable deficit in cold
molecular relative to ionized gas, which may imply that significant fractions
of the interstellar medium of these galaxies are participating in the winds.
Kinetic energies of the gas correspond to ~0.2% of the rest-mass equivalent of
the mass of the supermassive black hole, roughly in agreement with model
predictions. We also report the detection of a massive reservoir of few x 10^10

Pringsheim already in 1929. Doppler cooling of dilute atomic gases is an
extremely successful application of this concept, and more recently anti-Stokes
cooling in multilevel systems has been explored, culminating in the optical
refrigeration of solids. Collisional redistribution of radiation is a proposed
different cooling mechanism that involves atomic two-level systems, though
experimental investigations in gases with moderate density have so far not
reached the cooling regime.
  Here we experimentally demonstrate laser cooling of an atomic gas based on
collisional redistribution of radiation, using rubidium atoms subject to 230
bar of argon buffer gas pressure. The frequent collisions in the ultradense gas
transiently shift a far red detuned laser beam into resonance, while
spontaneous decay occurs close to the unperturbed atomic resonance frequency.
During each excitation cycle, a kinetic energy of order of the thermal energy
k_B T is extracted from the dense atomic sample. In a proof of principle
experiment with a thermally non-isolated sample, we experimentally demonstrate
relative cooling by 66 K. The cooled gas has a density of more than 10 orders
of magnitude above the typical values in Doppler cooling experiments, and the
cooling power reaches 87 mW. Future prospects of the demonstrated effect
include studies of supercooling beyond the homogeneous nucleation temperature

the average excitation energy of the isoscalar giant monopole resonance (GMR)
in stable and exotic neutron-rich nuclei by applying the relativistic extended
Thomas-Fermi method in scaling and constrained calculations. For the effective
nuclear interaction, we employ the relativistic mean field model supplemented
by an isoscalar-isovector meson coupling that allows one to modify the density
dependence of the symmetry energy without compromising the success of the model
for binding energies and charge radii. The semiclassical estimates of the
average energy of the GMR are known to be in good agreement with the results
obtained in full RPA calculations. The present analysis is performed along the
Pb and Zr isotopic chains. In the scaling calculations, the excitation energy
is larger when the symmetry energy is softer. The same happens in the
constrained calculations for nuclei with small and moderate neutron excess.
However, for nuclei of large isospin the constrained excitation energy becomes
smaller in models having a soft symmetry energy. This effect is mainly due to
the presence of loosely-bound outer neutrons in these isotopes. A sharp
increase of the estimated width of the resonance is found in largely
neutron-rich isotopes, even for heavy nuclei, which is enhanced when the
symmetry energy of the model is soft. The results indicate that at large
neutron numbers the structure of the low-energy region of the GMR strength
distribution changes considerably with the density dependence of the nuclear
symmetry energy, which may be worthy of further characterization in RPA
calculations of the response function.

general average properties of the sample, i.e. the distribution of photon
indices, high energy cut-offs, reflection fractions and absorption properties,
together with an in-depth analysis of their parameter space. We find that the
average Seyfert 1 power law has an index of 1.7 with a dispersion of 0.2. The
mean cut-off energy is at around 100 keV, with most objects displaying Ec in
the range 50-150 keV; the average amount of Compton reflection is 1.5 with a
typical dispersion of 0.7. We do not find any convincing correlation between
the various parameters, an indication that our analysis is not strongly
dependent by the interplay between them. Finally, we investigate how the
results presented in this work fit into current frameworks for AGN spectral
modeling and Cosmic Diffuse X-ray Background synthesis models.

resolve the higher frequency modes of the system. This feature may prove
particularly valuable for modeling the interaction of high-intensity laser
pulses with overcritical plasmas, in the case where the electrostatic modes in
the denser regions are of negligible influence on the physical processes under
study. To this goal, we have developed the new two-dimensional electromagnetic
code ELIXIRS (standing for ELectromagnetic Implicit X-dimensional Iterative
Relativistic Solver) based on the relativistic extension of the so-called
Direct Implicit Method [D. Hewett and A. B. Langdon, J. Comp. Phys.
\textbf{72}, 121(1987)]. Dissipation-free propagation of light waves into
vacuum is achieved by an adjustable-damping electromagnetic solver. In the
high-density case where the Debye length is not resolved, satisfactory energy
conservation is ensured by the use of high-order weight factors. In this paper,
we first present an original derivation of the electromagnetic direct implicit
method within a Newton iterative scheme. Its linear properties are then
investigated through numerically solving the relation dispersions obtained for
both light and plasma waves, accounting for finite space and time steps.
Finally, our code is successfully benchmarked against explicit particle-in-cell
simulations for two kinds of physical problems: plasma expansion into vacuum
and relativistic laser-plasma interaction. In both cases, we will demonstrate
the robustness of the implicit solver for crude discretizations, as well as the
gains in efficiency which can be realized over standard explicit simulations.

The initial data for Einstein's equations are a proper Riemannian metric

  Previous results in the case of asymptotically flat spacetimes provide a
solution to the constraint equations in one type of Sobolev spaces, while

is divided into two parts. In the first part, dynamical decoupling methods are
considered which have the task of suppressing the influence of residual
imperfections in a quantum memory. The suppression is achieved by altering the
dynamics of an imperfect quantum memory with the help of a sequence of local
unitary operations applied to the qudits. Whereas up to now the operations of
such decoupling sequences have been constructed in a deterministic fashion,
strategies are developed in this thesis which construct the operations by
random selection from a suitable set. Furthermore, it is investigated if and
how the discussed decoupling strategies can be employed to protect a quantum
computation running on the quantum memory.
  The second part of the thesis deals with quantum error-correcting codes and
protocols for quantum key distribution. The focus is on the BB84 and the
6-state protocol making use of only one-way communication during the error
correction and privacy amplification steps. It is shown that by adding
additional errors to the preliminary key (a process called noisy preprocessing)
followed by the use of a structured block code, higher secure key rates may be
obtained. For the BB84 protocol it is shown that iterating the combined
preprocessing leads to an even higher gain.

A constellation
based at O is a set of infinitely near points of O, centers of a sequence of
blow-ups above O. Finite constellations are usually encoded in two ways: either
using an Enriques diagram, or using the dual graph of the divisor obtained by
blowing-up the points of the constellation. Both are decorated trees which
encode completely the combinatorics of the constellation. Algorithms of passage
from one to the other are known, but they do not allow to get a geometrical
picture of their relation. We associate to a constellation a geometrical
simplicial complex of dimension two, called its kite, endowed with an affine
structure, and we prove that it contains canonically both the Enriques diagram
and the dual graph. Moreover, the decorations of the two trees may be read very
easily on the affine geometry of the kite. This allows to understand
geometrically the relations between the graphs, as well as their relation with
the valuative tree of Favre and Jonsson, which may be interpreted as the dual
graph of the constellation of all the points infinitely near O. In fact, the
kites of finite constellations get glued into an infinite kite endowed with a
1-dimensional foliation, whose space of leaves is the valuative tree. The
transition towards the computations with continued fractions is ensured by
partial embeddings of the kites into a simplicial complex canonically
associated to a base of a lattice, called its lotus. This last notion is
briefly explored in any dimension.

This gives rise to spin-spin correlations between the magnetic moment and the

this phenomenon, the so-called Kondo cloud, by means of the density matrix
renormalization group method for the case of the single-impurity Anderson

assumed to be proportional to the inverse Kondo temperature, can be extracted
from the spin-spin correlations. For several mechanisms -- the gate potential

dynamics of a gravitating system s embedded in a larger one S is affected by
the external background field E of S even if it is constant and uniform, thus
implying a violation of the Strong Equivalence Principle: it is the so-called
External Field Effect (EFE). In the case of the solar system, E would be
A_cen\approx 10^-10 m s^-2 because of its motion through the Milky Way: it is
orders of magnitude smaller than the main Newtonian monopole terms for the
planets. We address here the following questions in a purely phenomenological
manner: are the Sun's planets affected by an EFE as large as 10^-10 m s^-2? Can
it be assumed that its effect is negligible for them because of its relatively
small size? Does $\bds E$ induce vanishing net orbital effects because of its
constancy over typical solar system's planetary orbital periods? It turns out
that a constant and uniform acceleration, treated perturbatively, does induce
non-vanishing long-period orbital effects on the longitude of the pericenter of
a test particle. In the case of the inner planets of the solar system and with
E\approx 10^-10 m s^-2, they are 4-6 orders of magnitude larger than the
present-day upper bounds on the non-standard perihelion precessions recently
obtained with by E.V. Pitjeva with the EPM ephemerides in the Solar System
Barycentric frame. The upper limits on the components of E are E_x <= 1 x
10^-15 m s^-2, E_y <= 2 x 10^-16 m s^-2, E_z <= 3 x 10^-14 m s^-2. This result

These clusters have got a very different mass structure and dynamical state,
and are the two extremes from a larger sample of 38 X-ray luminous clusters of
similar size and redshift.
  We measure shear values of faint background galaxies and correct for PSF
anisotropies using the KSB+ method. Two-dimensional mass maps of the clusters
are created using a finite-field mass reconstruction algorithm, and verified
with aperture mass statistics. The masses inferred from the reconstructions are
compared to those obtained from fitting spherically symmetric SIS- and
NFW-models to the tangential shear profiles. We discuss the NFW concentration
parameters in detail.
  From the mass reconstructions we infer M200-masses of 11.7 +/- 3.1 * 10^14
h_70^-1 Msun and 10.5 +/- 2.7 * 10^14 h_70^-1 Msun for Abell 1351 and Abell

detect a significant secondary peak in the mass reconstruction as well as by
aperture mass statistics. This feature is also traced by clusters members
selected by means of their V-I colour, and hence is likely a real sub-structure
of Abell 1351. From our fits to the tangential shear we infer masses on the
order of M200 ~ 8-9 * 10^14 h_70^-1 Msun (Abell 1351) and M200 ~ 5-6 * 10^14

the computation of the bi-partite entanglement entropy in massive
1+1-dimensional quantum field theories. In most of our work we have considered
these theories to be also integrable. Our approach combines two main
ingredients: the ""replica trick"" and form factors for integrable models and
more generally for massive quantum field theory. Our basic idea for combining
fruitfully these two ingredients is that of the branch-point twist field. By
the replica trick we obtained an alternative way of expressing the entanglement
entropy as a function of the correlation functions of branch-point twist
fields. On the other hand, a generalisation of the form factor program has
allowed us to study, and in integrable cases to obtain exact expressions for,
form factors of such twist fields. By the usual decomposition of correlation
functions in an infinite series involving form factors, we obtained exact
results for the infrared behaviours of the bi-partite entanglement entropy, and
studied both its infrared and ultraviolet behaviours for different kinds of
models: with and without boundaries and backscattering, at and out of
integrability.

for high-redshift supernovae and to constrain the optimal DES observing
strategy using the Dark Energy Task Force figure of merit.

been studied in the temperature range from 0.3 to 0.6 K, with the transition
edge sensor (TES), the sole source of membrane heating. The test configuration
consisted of Mo/Au TESs lithographically defined on silicon nitride membranes 1
micron thick and 6 mm^2 in size. Trenches with variable depth were incorporated
between the TES and the silicon frame in order to manage the thermal transport.
It was shown that sharp features in the membrane surface, such as trenches,
significantly impede the modes of phonon transport. A nonlinear dependence of
thermal resistance on trench depth was observed. Partial perforation of silicon
nitride membranes to control thermal transport could be useful in fabricating
mechanically robust detector devices.

scenario, both in heterotic model building and from the perspective of
higher-dimensional Grand Unified Theories. When combined with radion mediated
supersymmetry breaking, it allows for very specific predictions concerning the
high-scale parameters of the MSSM. Using an appropriately modified version of a
standard RGE evolution code (SuSpect), we derive low-scale predictions which
can be tested at the LHC. The phenomenological success of our setting depends
crucially on the 5d Chern-Simons term, which has not been used in previous,
less encouraging studies of gauge-Higgs unification in supersymmetry.

stellar disk, meaning that they can be detected by a periodic decrease in the
starlight flux. The light from the star passes through the atmosphere of the
planet, and in a few cases the basic atmospheric composition of the planet can
be estimated. As we get closer to finding analogues of Earth, an important
consideration toward the characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres is what
the transmission spectrum of our planet looks like. Here we report the optical
and near-infrared transmission spectrum of the Earth, obtained during a lunar
eclipse. Some biologically relevant atmospheric features that are weak in the
reflected spectrum (such as ozone, molecular oxygen, water, carbon dioxide and
methane) are much stronger in the transmission spectrum, and indeed stronger
than predicted by modelling. We also find the fingerprints of the Earth's
ionosphere and of the major atmospheric constituent, diatomic nitrogen (N2),
which are missing in the reflected spectrum.

is formulated for plane waves, and thus the only qualification one could demand
of a $4\times 4$ real matrix $M$ in order that it qualifies to be the Mueller
matrix of some physical system is that $M$ should map $\Omega^{({\rm pol})}$,
the positive cone of Stokes vectors, into itself. In view of growing current
interest in the characterization of partially coherent partially polarized
electromagnetic beams, there is need to extend this formalism to such beams
wherein the polarization and spatial dependence are generically inseparably
intertwined. This inseparability or non-quantum entanglement brings in
additional constraints that a pre-Mueller matrix $M$ mapping $\Omega^{({\rm
pol})}$ into itself needs to meet in order that it is an acceptable physical
Mueller matrix. These additional constraints are motivated and fully
characterized.
