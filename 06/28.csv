candidates) are produced at colliders in pairs due to an exact symmetry called
a ""parity"". These particles escape detection, rendering their mass measurement
difficult. In the pair production of such particles via a specific (""antler"")
decay topology, kinematic cusp structures are present in the invariant mass and
angular distributions of the observable particles. Together with the
end-points, such cusps can be used to measure the missing particle mass and the
intermediate particle mass in the decay chain. Our simulation of a benchmark
scenario in a Z' supersymmetric model shows that the cusp feature survives
under the consideration of detector simulation and the standard model
backgrounds. This technique for determining missing particle masses should be
invaluable in the search for new physics at the LHC and future lepton
colliders.

called ""bin packing with general cost structures"" (GCBP) and design an
asymptotic fully polynomial time approximation scheme (AFPTAS) for this
problem. In the classic bin packing problem, a set of one-dimensional items is
to be assigned to subsets of total size at most 1, that is, to be packed into
unit sized bins. However, in GCBP, the cost of a bin is not 1 as in classic bin
packing, but it is a non-decreasing and concave function of the number of items
packed in it, where the cost of an empty bin is zero. The construction of the
AFPTAS requires novel techniques for dealing with small items, which are
developed in this work. In addition, we develop a fast approximation algorithm
which acts identically for all non-decreasing and concave functions, and has an
asymptotic approximation ratio of 1.5 for all functions simultaneously.

configurations in accretion discs around magnetised neutron stars. Our strategy
is to start with a very simple model and then progressively improve it
providing complementary insight into results obtained with large numerical
simulations. In our first model, presented here, we work in the kinematic
approximation and consider the stellar magnetic field as being a dipole aligned
with the stellar rotation axis and perpendicular to the disc plane, while the
flow in the disc is taken to be steady and axisymmetric. The behaviour in the
radial direction is then independent of that in the azimuthal direction. We
investigate the distortion of the field caused by interaction with the disc
matter, solving the induction equation numerically in full 2D. The influence of
turbulent diffusivity and fluid velocity on the poloidal field configuration is
analysed, including discussion of outflows from the top and bottom of the disc.
We find that the distortions increase with increasing magnetic Reynolds number
R_m (calculated using the radial velocity). However, a single global parameter
does not give an adequate description in different parts of the disc and we use
instead a `magnetic distortion function' D_m(r,\theta) (a magnetic Reynolds
number defined locally). Where D_m<<1 (near to the inner edge of the disc)
there is little distortion, but where D_m>1 (most of the rest of the disc),
there is considerable distortion and the field becomes weaker than the dipole
would have been. Between these two regions, there is a transition zone where
the field is amplified and can have a local minimum and maximum. The location
of this zone depends sensitively on the diffusivity. The results depend very
little on the boundary conditions at the top of the disc.

been widely studied in literature. Randomized security protocols have also been

in an electric field because a component of each spin is conserved during
precession. Spin currents arise because a component of each spin is continually
precessing. These two phenomena are due to independent contributions to the
steady-state density matrix, and scattering between the conserved and

has a size of $\sim 1$ kpc, a mass of $\sim 10^6 {\rm M}_{\odot}$, and a
ring-like distribution of young stars. Fundamental physical properties of this
local enigmatic structure, known as the Gould belt (GB), have not been
reproduced by previously proposed models. We first show that the local
enigmatic structure can be formed about 30 Myr ago as a result of a high-speed,
oblique collision between a gas cloud with a mass of $\sim 10^6 {\rm
M}_{\odot}$ and a dark matter clump with a mass of $\sim 10^7 {\rm M}_{\odot}$
based on numerical simulations of the collision. We find that strong dynamical
impact of the clump transforms the flattened cloud into a ring-like stellar
structure after induced star formation within the cloud. Our simulations
furthermore demonstrate that the stellar structure is moderately elongated and
significantly inclined with respect to the disk of the Milky Way owing to the
strong tidal torque by the colliding clump. We thus suggest that the GB is one
of stellar substructures formed from collisions between gas clouds and dark
matter clumps predicted in the hierarchical clustering scenario of galaxy
formation. We also suggest that collisions of dark matter clumps with their
host galaxies can significantly change star formation histories for some of
their gas clouds thus influence galactic global star formation histories to
some extent.
