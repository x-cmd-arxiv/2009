limited number of shapelet modes is available for the model, and (b) the
intrinsic galactic shapes are not restricted to shapelet models.
  We create a set of simplistic simulations, in which the galactic shapes
follow a Sersic profile. By varying the Sersic index and applied shear, we
quantify the amount of bias on shear estimates which arises from insufficient
modeling. Additional complications due to PSF convolution, pixelation and pixel
noise are also discussed.
  Steep and highly elliptical galaxy shapes cannot be accurately modeled within
the circular shapelet basis system and are biased towards shallower and less
elongated shapes. This problem can be cured partially by allowing elliptical
basis functions, but for steep profiles elliptical shapelet models still depend
critically on accurate ellipticity priors. As a result, shear estimates are
typically biased low. Independently of the particular form of the estimator,
the bias depends on the true intrinsic galaxy morphology, but also on the size
and shape of the PSF.
  As long as the issues discussed here are not solved, the shapelet method
cannot provide weak-lensing measurements with an accuracy demanded by upcoming
missions and surveys, unless one can provide an accurate and reliable

may be formalized as a Yang-Mills theory. As a consequence, there is no need of
the Higgs field or any symmetry breaking mechanism to generate the mass of
fundamental particles. We show that one can get rid of the Yukawa couplings in
favor of the covariant derivative. Finally, a set of partial differential
equations that is equivalent to Einstein equations is established for the gamma

involves a departure from the Schwarzschild solution that may be tested by

the asymptotic null distributions are obtained under independent and

white noise. Due to recent popularity of conditional heteroscedastic models
(e.g., GARCH models), which imply nonlinear dependence with zero
autocorrelation, there is a need to understand the asymptotic properties of the
existing test statistics under unknown dependence. In this paper, we showed
that the asymptotic null distribution of Box-Pierce's test statistic with
general weights still holds under unknown weak dependence so long as the lag
truncation number grows at an appropriate rate with increasing sample size.
Further applications to diagnostic checking of the ARMA and FARIMA models with
dependent white noise errors are also addressed. Our results go beyond earlier
ones by allowing non-Gaussian and conditional heteroscedastic errors in the
ARMA and FARIMA models and provide theoretical support for some empirical

formulated in terms of (a version of) vertex algebras. Our starting point is
the Wilson-Zimmermann operator product expansion (OPE). Following ideas of a
previous paper [arXiv:0802.2198], we consider a consistency (essentially
associativity) condition satisfied by the coefficients in this expansion. We
observe that the information in the OPE coefficients can be repackaged
straightforwardly into ""vertex operators"" and that the consistency condition
then has essentially the same form as the key condition in the theory of vertex
algebras. We develop a general theory of perturbations of the algebras that we
encounter, similar in nature to the Hochschild cohomology describing the
deformation theory of ordinary algebras. The main part of the paper is devoted
to the question how one can calculate the perturbations corresponding to a
given interaction Lagrangian (such as $\lambda \varphi^4$) in practice, using
the consistency condition and the corresponding non-linear field equation. We
derive graphical rules, which display the vertex operators (i.e., OPE
coefficients) in terms of certain multiple series of hypergeometric type.

be more effectively cast within the framework of the naturally associated

$L_2=L_2(\pi)$, where $\pi$ is the invariant measure of the chain. This
observation is, in part, based on the following results. A discrete-time Markov
chain with values in a general state space is geometrically ergodic if and only
if its transition kernel admits a spectral gap in $L_\infty^V$. If the chain is
reversible, the same equivalence holds with $L_2$ in place of $L_\infty^V$, but
in the absence of reversibility it fails: There are (necessarily
non-reversible, geometrically ergodic) chains that admit a spectral gap in
$L_\infty^V$ but not in $L_2$. Moreover, if a chain admits a spectral gap in
$L_2$, then for any $h\in L_2$ there exists a Lyapunov function $V_h\in L_1$
such that $V_h$ dominates $h$ and the chain admits a spectral gap in
$L_\infty^{V_h}$. The relationship between the size of the spectral gap in
$L_\infty^V$ or $L_2$, and the rate at which the chain converges to equilibrium

solved the cross-layer optimization offline, under the assumption that the

however, these dynamics are unknown a priori and therefore must be learned
online. In this paper, we address this problem by allowing the multimedia
system layers to learn, through repeated interactions with each other, to
autonomously optimize the system's long-term performance at run-time. We
propose two reinforcement learning algorithms for optimizing the system under
different design constraints: the first algorithm solves the cross-layer
optimization in a centralized manner, and the second solves it in a
decentralized manner. We analyze both algorithms in terms of their required
computation, memory, and inter-layer communication overheads. After noting that
the proposed reinforcement learning algorithms learn too slowly, we introduce a
complementary accelerated learning algorithm that exploits partial knowledge
about the system's dynamics in order to dramatically improve the system's
performance. In our experiments, we demonstrate that decentralized learning can
perform as well as centralized learning, while enabling the layers to act
autonomously. Additionally, we show that existing application-independent

fluid composition in well logging. One of the critical assumptions often made
is that the diffusion of fluid molecules is sufficiently fast to warrant the
condition for direct mapping between the surface-enhanced relaxation rate and
the pore geometry. In pores satisfying such a condition, but having a
significant spatial variation of surface relaxivity (rho), one can show that
the one-to-one mapping may break down. The degree to which the NMR logging
interpretation is affected has not been systematically studied until now. In
this work, we theoretically investigate the interplay between the pore
geometry, internal field and the inhomogeneous surface relaxivity. We develop a
perturbative framework and compare its results with exact solutions obtained
for a class of rho textures in a pore with simple geometry. Its effect is
quantified for a wide range of diffusivity and/or rho strength. The result
allows us to set the bounds for the change in the final slope of the relaxation
curve and may serve as a useful guide for logging applications in real rocks
with a wide range of pore sizes and fluid diffusivity. We further employ large
scale numerical simulations to perform virtual experiments on more complex
situations. Internal field and its gradient distributions were obtained and
analyzed for up to 1.5^3 cm^3 based on tomograms of carbonate rocks. We find
that the texture of rho based on the internal field gradient induces a small,
but observable shift, compared to a random noise generated texture for which no
shift is observed.

explanation of small neutrino masses with triplet fermions in the 100 GeV mass
range, without fine tuning of the Yukawa couplings to extremely small values.
The triplet fermions couple to the gauge bosons and can be thus produced at the
LHC. We study in detail the effective cross-sections for the production and
subsequent decays of these heavy exotic fermions. We show for the first time
that the $\mu$-$\tau$ flavor symmetry in the low energy neutrino mass matrix
results in mixing matrices for the neutral and charged heavy fermions that are
not unity and which carry the flavor symmetry pattern. This flavor structure
can be observed in the decays of the heavy fermions at LHC. The large Yukawa
couplings in our model result in the decay of the heavy fermions into lighter
leptons and Higgs with a decay rate which is about $10^{11}$ times larger than
what is expected for the one Higgs Type III seesaw model with 100 GeV triplet
fermions. The smallness of neutrino masses constrains the neutral Higgs mixing
angle $\sin\alpha$ in our model in such a way that the heavy fermions decay
into the lighter neutral CP even Higgs $h^0$, CP odd Higgs $A^0$ and the
charged Higgs $H^\pm$, but almost never to the heavier neutral CP even Higgs
$H^0$. The small value for $\sin\alpha$ also results in a very long lifetime
for $h^0$. This displaced decay vertex should be visible at LHC. We provide an

1^{--}$, Y(4260) resonance due to the interaction between these three mesons.
In order to do this, we start by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the
two pseudoscalar and for the vector-pseudocalar meson systems using the
amplitudes obtained from the lowest order chiral Lagrangians as potentials.
With the $t$-matrices generated from these potentials, which contain the poles
of the $\sigma$, $f_{0}(980)$ and $a_{0}(980)$ resonances for the
pseudoscalar-pseudoscalar system and the pole of the X(3872), alongwith other
new charmed resonant states, for the vector-pseudoscalar system, we solve the
Faddeev equations. As a result, we get a peak around 4150 MeV with a width
$\sim$ 90 MeV when the invariant mass of the two pseudoscalars is close to that
of the $f_0 (980)$.

some prototypes of junctions have been demonstrated for the extension of ion
motion to two dimensions (2D). While junctions require complex trap structures,
small extensions to the 1D motion can be accomplished in simple linear trap
arrangements. Here, control of the extended field in a planar, linear chip trap
is used to shuttle ions in 2D. With this approach, the order of ions in a

derived and simulations show that the reordering can be carried out

presents a new tool for ion-trap quantum computing. The method is also expected
to work with mixed crystals of different ion species and as such could have

levels in turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in local
astrophysical disk models. This study uses the Athena code to characterize the
effects of a constant shear viscosity \nu and Ohmic resistivity \eta in
unstratified shearing box simulations with a net toroidal magnetic flux. A
previous study of shearing boxes with zero net magnetic field performed with
the ZEUS code found that turbulence dies out for values of the magnetic Prandtl
number, P_m = \nu/\eta, below P_m \sim 1; for P_m \gtrsim 1, time- and
volume-averaged stress levels increase with P_m. We repeat these experiments
with Athena and obtain consistent results. Next, the influence of viscosity and
resistivity on the toroidal field MRI is investigated both for linear growth
and for fully-developed turbulence. In the linear regime, a sufficiently large
\nu or \eta can prevent MRI growth; P_m itself has little direct influence on
growth from linear perturbations. By applying a range of values for \nu and
\eta to an initial state consisting of fully developed turbulence in the
presence of a background toroidal field, we investigate their effects in the
fully nonlinear system. Here, increased viscosity enhances the turbulence, and
the turbulence decays only if the resistivity is above a critical value;
turbulence can be sustained even when P_m < 1, in contrast to the zero net
field model. While we find preliminary evidence that the stress converges to a
small range of values when \nu and \eta become small enough, the influence of
dissipation terms on MRI-driven turbulence for relatively large \eta and \nu is
significant, independent of field geometry.

driving its presently accelerated expansion, has progressively grown during the
last decade of cosmological observations. If this dark energy is given by a
dynamic scalar field, it may also have a direct interaction with other matter
fields in the Universe, in particular with cold dark matter. Such interaction
would imprint new features on the cosmological background evolution as well as
on the growth of cosmic structure, like an additional long-range fifth-force
between massive particles, or a variation in time of the dark matter particle
mass. We review here the implementation of these new physical effects in the
N-body code GADGET-2, and we discuss the outcomes of a series of
high-resolution N-body simulations for a selected family of interacting dark
energy models, as already presented in Baldi et al. [20]. We interestingly
find, in contrast with previous claims, that the inner overdensity of dark
matter halos decreases in these models with respect to LCDM, and consistently
halo concentrations show a progressive reduction for increasing couplings.
Furthermore, the coupling induces a bias in the overdensities of cold dark
matter and baryons that determines a decrease of the halo baryon fraction below
its cosmological value. These results go in the direction of alleviating

governed by a $f(R)$ theory a number of issues should be reexamined in this

examine the question as to whether the $f(R)$ gravity theories permit
space-times in which the causality is violated. We show that the field
equations of these $f(R)$ gravity theories do not exclude solutions with
breakdown of causality for a physically well-motivated perfect-fluid matter
content. We demonstrate that every perfect-fluid G\""{o}del-type solution of a
generic $f(R)$ gravity satisfying the condition $df/dR > 0$ is necessarily
isometric to the G\""odel geometry, and therefore presents violation of
causality. This result extends a theorem on G\""{o}del-type models, which has
been established in the context of general relativity. We also derive an
expression for the critical radius $r_c$ (beyond which the causality is
violated) for an arbitrary $f(R)$ theory, making apparent that the violation of
causality depends on both the $f(R)$ gravity theory and the matter content. As
an illustration, we concretely take a recent $f(R)$ gravity theory that is free
from singularities of the Ricci scalar and is cosmologically viable, and show
that this theory accommodates noncausal as well as causal G\""odel-type
solutions.

the spheroid mass density, minor mergers contribute ~30%. (2) This is
mass-dependent: bulge formation is dominated by more minor mergers in
lower-mass systems. At higher masses, bulges form in major mergers near L*, but
subsequently assemble in minor mergers. (3) The minor/major contribution is
also morphology-dependent: higher B/T systems form in more major mergers, lower
B/T systems form in situ from minor mergers. (4) Low-mass galaxies, being
gas-rich, require more major mergers to reach the same B/T as high-mass
systems. (5) Absolute merger rates increase with galaxy mass. (6) Predicted
rates agree well with observations, but suggest that some morphology-selected
samples include contamination from minor mergers. (7) Predicted rates agree
with integrated growth in bulge mass with cosmic time, but with factor ~2
uncertainty - half the bulge mass density could come from non-mergers. We
consider ~1000 model variations and quantify resulting uncertainties.
Conclusions regarding the major/minor contribution to bulge growth are very

longer than the dynamical time. It is also inefficient; essentially all star
formation in local galaxies takes place in giant molecular clouds (GMCs), but
the fraction of a GMC converted to stars is very small, ~5%. In the most
luminous starbursts, the GMC lifetime is shorter than the main sequence
lifetime of even the most massive stars, so that supernovae can play no role in
GMC disruption. We investigate the disruption of GMCs across a wide range of
galaxies, from normal spirals to the densest starbursts; we take into account
the effects of HII gas pressure, shocked stellar winds, protostellar jets, and
radiation pressure produced by the absorption and scattering of starlight on
dust grains. In the Milky Way, we find that a combination of three mechanisms,
jets, HII gas pressure, and radiation pressure, disrupts the clouds. In more
rapidly star forming galaxies such as ``clump'' galaxies at high-redshift,
ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) and submillimeter galaxies, radiation
pressure dominates natal cloud distribution. We predict the presence of 10-20
clusters with masses ~10^7 Msun in local ULIRGs such as Arp 220 and a similar
number of clusters with M_* ~ 10^8 Msun in high redshift clump galaxies;
submillimeter galaxies will have even more massive clusters. We find that the
mass fraction of a GMC that ends up in stars is an increasing function of the
gas surface density of a galaxy, reaching ~35% in the most luminous starbursts.
Furthermore, the disruption of bubbles by radiation pressure stirs the
interstellar medium to velocities of ~10 km/s in normal galaxies and to ~100
km/s in ULIRGs like Arp 220, consistent with observations. Thus, radiation
pressure may play a dominant role in the ISM of star-forming galaxies.

marginalizing over parameters that describe the MW potential, and use this

two aspects of binary populations: the XLF behavior at the low luminosity limit
and comparison between globular cluster and field sources. The 800 ksec
exposure of the deep Chandra VLP program allows us to reach a limiting
luminosity of 8e35 erg/s, about 2-3 times deeper than previous investigations.
We confirm the presence of the low luminosity break in the overall LMXB XLF at
log(L_X)=37.2-37.6 below which the luminosity distribution follows a constant
dN/d(ln L). Separating globular cluster and field sources, we find a
statistically significant difference between the two luminosity distributions
with a relative underabundance of faint sources in the globular cluster
population. This demonstrates that the samples are drawn from distinct parent
populations and may disprove the hypothesis that the entire LMXB population in
early type galaxies is created dynamically in globular clusters. As a plausible
explanation for this difference in the XLFs, we suggest that there is an
enhanced fraction of helium accreting systems in globular clusters, which are
created in collisions between red giants and neutron stars. Due to the 4 times
higher ionization temperature of He, such systems are subject to accretion disk
instabilities at approximately 20 times higher mass accretion rate, and
therefore are not observed as persistent sources at low luminosities.

on-axis effective area is assumed in general to characterize the collecting
power of an X-ray optic, the telescope capability of imaging extended X-ray
sources is also determined by the variation in its effective area with the
off-axis angle. [...] The complex task of designing optics for future X-ray
telescopes entails detailed computations of both imaging quality and effective
area on- and off-axis. Because of their apparent complexity, both aspects have
been, so far, treated by using ray-tracing routines aimed at simulating the
interaction of X-ray photons with the reflecting surfaces of a given focusing
system. Although this approach has been widely exploited and proven to be
effective, it would also be attractive to regard the same problem from an

with a simpler calculation than a ray-tracing routine. [...] We have developed
useful analytical formulae for the off-axis effective area of a
double-reflection mirror in the double cone approximation, requiring only an
integration and the standard routines to calculate the X-ray coating
reflectivity for a given incidence angle. [...] Algebraic expressions are
provided for the mirror geometric area, as a function of the off-axis angle.
Finally, the results of the analytical computations presented here are
validated by comparison with the corresponding predictions of a ray-tracing

measurements from the literature at similar angular resolution. The IR SEDs of
intermediate-type Seyferts are flatter and present higher 10 to 18 micron
ratios than those of Seyfert 2. We fit the individual SEDs with clumpy torus
models using the in-house-developed BayesClumpy tool. The models reproduce the
high spatial resolution measurements. Regardless of the Seyfert type, even with
high spatial resolution data, near- to mid-IR SED fitting poorly constrains the
radial extent of the torus. For the Seyfert 2, we find that edge-on geometries
are more probable than face-on views, with a number of clouds along equatorial
rays of N = 5-15. The 10 micron silicate feature is generally modeled in
shallow absorption. For the intermediate-type Seyferts, N and the inclination
angle of the torus are lower than those of the Seyfert 2 nuclei, with the
silicate feature appearing in weak emission or absent. The columns of material
responsible for the X-ray absorption are larger than those inferred from the
model fits for most of the galaxies, which is consistent with X-ray absorbing
gas being located within the dust sublimation radius whereas the mid-IR flux
arises from an area farther from the accretion disc. The fits yield both the
bolometric luminosity of the intrinsic AGN and the torus integrated luminosity,
from which we derive the reprocessing efficiency of the torus. In the models,
the outer radial extent of the torus scales with the AGN luminosity, and we

independent on where the scalar is placed inside the product and three pairwise

two-stage evolution consisting of an abrupt regime transition from a slow to a
fast reconnection process leading the system to a final chaotic configuration.
Yet, the onset of the fast phase is not determined by the presence of any
anomalous enhancement in plasma's local resistivity, but rather is the result
of a new mechanism discovered in Lapenta (2008)* and captured only when
sufficient resolution is present. Hence, the effects of the global resistivity,
the global viscosity and the plasma beta on the overall dynamics are
considered. This mechanism allowing the transition from slow to fast
reconnection provides a simple but effective model of several processes taking
place within the solar atmosphere from the high chromosphere up to the low
corona. In fact, the understanding of a spontaneous transition to a
self-feeding fast reconnection regime as well as its macroscopic evolution is
the first and fundamental step to produce realistic models of all those

composition of the metastable Ti-Fe-C film changes. An iron-rich phase is first
formed close to the film surface, but with increasing annealing time this phase
is gradually displaced toward the film-substrate interface where its position
stabilizes. Both the magnetic ordering temperature and the saturation
magnetization changes significantly upon annealing. The DFT calculations show
that the critical temperature and the magnetic moment both increase with
increasing Fe and C-vacancy concentration. The formation of the metastable
iron-rich Ti-Fe-C compound is reflected in the strong increase of the magnetic
ordering temperature. Eventually, after enough annealing time ($\geq 10$
minutes), nano-crystalline $\alpha$-Fe starts to precipitate and the amount and
size of these precipitates can be controlled by the annealing procedure; after
20 minutes of annealing, the experimental results indicate a nano-crystalline
iron-film embedded in a wear resistant TiC compound. This conclusion is further
supported by transmission electron microscopy studies on epitaxial Ti-Fe-C
films deposited on single crystalline MgO substrates where, upon annealing, an

Brillouin zone which is consistent with a long-range ordered magneto-structural
groundstate. No signature of Fermi surface nesting instability associated with

arbitrary number of relay nodes, what is the maximum rate of information flow
achievable? We make progress on this long standing problem through a two-step
approach. First we propose a deterministic channel model which captures the key
wireless properties of signal strength, broadcast and superposition. We obtain
an exact characterization of the capacity of a network with nodes connected by
such deterministic channels. This result is a natural generalization of the
celebrated max-flow min-cut theorem for wired networks. Second, we use the
insights obtained from the deterministic analysis to design a new
quantize-map-and-forward scheme for Gaussian networks. In this scheme, each
relay quantizes the received signal at the noise level and maps it to a random
Gaussian codeword for forwarding, and the final destination decodes the
source's message based on the received signal. We show that, in contrast to
existing schemes, this scheme can achieve the cut-set upper bound to within a
gap which is independent of the channel parameters. In the case of the relay
channel with a single relay as well as the two-relay Gaussian diamond network,
the gap is 1 bit/s/Hz. Moreover, the scheme is universal in the sense that the
relays need no knowledge of the values of the channel parameters to
(approximately) achieve the rate supportable by the network. We also present
extensions of the results to multicast networks, half-duplex networks and
ergodic networks.

particular, on energies below 1 keV, which are of particular relevance to the
understanding of the Diffuse X-ray Background. The average field of all the
exposures is 0.09 deg^-2. We reached an average flux sensitivity of 5.8x10^-16
erg s^-1 cm^-2 in the soft band (0.5-2.0 keV) and 2.5x10^-16 erg s^-1 cm^-2 in
the very soft band (0.4-0.6 keV). In this paper we discuss the logN-logS

of the cumulative spectrum from all sources. In particular, we found an excess
flux at around 0.5 keV in the composite spectrum of faint sources. The excess
seems to be a general property of all the fields observed suggesting an
additional class of weak sources is contributing to the X-ray emission at these
energies. Combining our results with previous investigations we have also
quantified the contribution of the individual components of the diffuse X-ray

signals the breakdown of the spacetime continuum picture near that scale, and

explain the dynamics of crowds simultaneously and consistently across these

them. Its most natural statistical descriptor (order parameter) is crowd
entropy $S$ that satisfies the Prigogine's extended second law of
thermodynamics, $\partial_t S\geq 0$ (for any nonisolated multi-component
system). Qualitative similarities and superpositions between individual and
crowd configuration manifolds motivate our claim that \emph{goal-directed crowd
movement} operates under entropy conservation, $\partial_t S = 0$, while
\emph{naturally chaotic crowd dynamics} operates under (monotonically)
increasing entropy function, $\partial_t S > 0$. Between these two distinct
topological phases lies a phase transition with a chaotic inter-phase. Both

away from the identity or not. It is well known that this problem is

Check problem remains QMA-Complete for circuits of short depth. Specifically,
we prove that for constant depth quantum circuit in which each gate is given to
at least $\Omega(\log n)$ bits of precision, the Non-Identity Check problem is
QMA-Complete. It also follows that the hardness of the problem remains for
polylogarithmic depth circuit consisting of only gates from any universal gate

This heating enigma is typically addressed by invoking the deposition at
coronal heights of non-thermal energy generated by the interplay between
convection and magnetic field near the photosphere. However, it remains unclear
how and where coronal heating occurs and how the corona is filled with hot
plasma. We show that energy deposition at coronal heights cannot be the only
source of coronal heating, by revealing a significant coronal mass supply
mechanism that is driven from below, in the chromosphere. We quantify the
asymmetry of spectral lines observed with Hinode and SOHO and identify faint
but ubiquitous upflows with velocities that are similar (50-100 km/s) across a
wide range of magnetic field configurations and for temperatures from 100,000
to several million degrees. These upflows are spatio-temporally correlated with
and have similar upward velocities as recently discovered, cool (10,000 K)
chromospheric jets or (type II) spicules. We find these upflows to be pervasive
and universal. Order of magnitude estimates constrained by conservation of mass
and observed emission measures indicate that the mass supplied by these
spicules can play a significant role in supplying the corona with hot plasma.
The properties of these events are incompatible with coronal loop models that
only include nanoflares at coronal heights. Our results suggest that a
significant part of the heating and energizing of the corona occurs at
chromospheric heights, in association with chromospheric jets.

from the data using the relative positions of the data points from various

proximity region associated with each data point and different graph statistics
can be employed for data reduction. The approach used in this article is based
on a parameterized family of proximity maps determining an associated family of
data-random digraphs. The relative arc density of the digraph is used as the
summary statistic, providing an alternative to the domination number employed
previously. An important advantage of the relative arc density is that,
properly re-scaled, it is a U-statistic, facilitating analytic study of its
asymptotic distribution using standard U-statistic central limit theory. The
approach is illustrated with an application to the testing of spatial patterns
of segregation and association. Knowledge of the asymptotic distribution allows
evaluation of the Pitman and Hodges-Lehmann asymptotic efficacy, and selection
of the proximity map parameter to optimize efficacy. Notice that the approach
presented here also has the advantage of validity for data in any dimension.

Since the front of synchronization travels slower than the front of
desynchronization, the maximal possible chain length for which information can
be transmitted by modulating the first unit of the chain is bounded.

its polarization properties are expected to differ markedly. The later time

periodic changes in the amplitudes and frequencies of the oscillation modes

asteroseismic measurements of the convection zone depth and differential

at the base of the convection zone. In this paper, we analyze the precision
that will be possible using Kepler to measure stellar cycles, convection zone

hydrogen out of the neutral hydrogen phase. In a quasi equilibrium state, mass
fraction of H2 is about 0.4 (total H2 mass is ~1.5 10^6 Msun) of the total gas
mass for the uniform far UV (FUV) with G_0 = 10. The gas forms an inhomogeneous
disk, whose scale-height becomes larger in the outer region. H2 forms a thin
nuclear disk in the inner ~ 5 pc, which is surrounded by molecular clouds
swelled up toward h < 10 pc. The velocity field of the disk is highly turbulent
in the torus region, whose velocity dispersion is ~ 20 km/s on average. Average
supernova rate (SNR) of ~ 5 10^-5/yr is large enough to energize these

observed if the viewing angle is smaller than \theta_v ~ 50 deg from the
edge-on. However, the column densities are distributed over almost two orders
of magnitude around the average for any given viewing angle due to the clumpy
nature of the torus. For a stronger FUV (G_0 =100), the total H2 mass in an
equillibrium is only slightly smaller (~ 0.35). Finally the morphology and
kinematics of the circumnuclear molecular gas disks emerging from our models is
similar to that revealed by recent near infrared observations using VLTI/Keck.

The players share no common labelling of the locations. They wish to minimize

part, we derive a derivative formula for the Brown-York mass of a smooth family
of closed 2 dimensional surfaces evolving in an ambient three dimensional
manifold. As an interesting by-product, we are able to write the ADM mass
\cite{ADM61} of an asymptotically flat 3-manifold as the sum of the Brown-York
mass of a coordinate sphere $S_r$ and an integral of the scalar curvature plus
a geometrically constructed function $\Phi(x)$ in the asymptotic region outside

defined, if $\Sigma$ bounds a compact spacelike hypersurface in $\R^{3,1}$,
then the Liu-Yau mass of $\Sigma$ is strictly positive unless $\Sigma$ lies on

domain spanning the upper layers of the convection zone to the lower corona. We
use the Oslo Staggered Code to solve the full MHD equations with non-grey and
NLTE radiative transfer and thermal conduction along the magnetic field lines.
In this paper we concentrate on the later stages of the simulations and study
the evolution of the structure of the rising flux in the upper chromosphere and
corona, the interaction between the emerging flux and the weak coronal magnetic
field initially present, and the associated dynamics.
  The flux tube injected at the bottom boundary rises to the photosphere where
it largely remains. However, some parts of the flux tube become unstable and
expand in patches into the upper chromosphere. The flux rapidly expands towards
the corona, pushing the coronal and transition region material aside, lifting
and maintaining the transition region at heights greater than 5 Mm above the
photosphere for extensive periods of time. The pre-existing magnetic field in
the corona and transition region is perturbed by the incoming flux and
reoriented by a series of high Joule heating events. Low density structures
form in the corona while at later times a high density filamentary structure
appears in the lower part of the expanding flux. The dynamics of these and
other structures is discussed. While Joule heating due to the expanding flux is
episodic, it increases in relative strength as fresh magnetic field rises and
becomes energetically important in the upper chromosphere and corona at later
times. Chromospheric, transition region and coronal lines are computed and
their response to the perturbation caused by the expanding emerging flux is
discussed.

radio-silent isolated neutron stars (INSs) which are detected only through the
relatively dim and purely thermal X-ray emission from the cooling star surface.
A few of these INSs (a.k.a. X-ray Dim INSs, or XDINSs) have been also detected
at optical wavelengths where they seem to feature thermal spectra. Optical
studies of XDINSs thus play a crucial role in mapping the temperature
distribution on the neutron star surface and in investigating the existence of
an atmosphere around the neutron star. The aim of this work is to investigate
the optical identification of the XDINS RX J0420.0-5022, tentatively proposed
by Haberl et al. (2004) based on VLT observations. We re-analysed the original
observations of Haberl et al. to assess the detection significance of the
proposed counterpart and we performed deeper VLT observations aiming at a
higher confidence detection. With a ~2 sigma detection significance and a
re-computed flux of B=27.52+/-0.61, we can not rule out that the proposed
counterpart was spurious and produced by the halo of a very bright nearby star.
While we could not detect the proposed counterpart in our deeper VLT
observations, we found evidence for a marginally significant (~3.9 sigma)
detection of a similarly faint object (B= 27.5+/-0.3), ~ 0.5"" north of it and
coincident with the updated Chandra position of RX J0420.0-5022. Interestingly,
the angular separation is consistent with the upper limit on the RX
J0420.0-5022 proper motion (Motch et al. 2009), which suggests that we might
have actually detected the Haberl et al. proposed counterpart. From the flux of
the putative RX J0420.0-5022 counterpart we can rule out a > 7 optical excess

  Patterns (Technical Report)","63 pages, 26 figures",,,"Technical Report # KU-EC-09-5","math.ST math.CO stat.ME stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The use of data-random graphs in statistical testing of spatial patterns is
introduced recently. In this approach, a random directed graph is constructed
from the data using the relative positions of the points from various classes.
Different random graphs result from different definitions of the proximity
region associated with each data point and different graph statistics can be
employed for pattern testing. The approach used in this article is based on
underlying graphs of a family of data-random digraphs which is determined by a
family of parameterized proximity maps. The relative edge density of the AND-
and OR-underlying graphs is used as the summary statistic, providing an
alternative to the relative arc density and domination number of the digraph
employed previously. Properly scaled, relative edge density of the underlying
graphs is a U-statistic, facilitating analytic study of its asymptotic
distribution using standard U-statistic central limit theory. The approach is
illustrated with an application to the testing of bivariate spatial clustering
patterns of segregation and association. Knowledge of the asymptotic
distribution allows evaluation of the Pitman asymptotic efficiency, hence
selection of the proximity map parameter to optimize efficiency. Asymptotic
efficiency and Monte Carlo simulation analysis indicate that the AND-underlying
version is better (in terms of power and efficiency) for the segregation
alternative, while the OR-underlying version is better for the association
alternative. The approach presented here is also valid for data in higher
dimensions.

applying steady state models of thin disks. The thin disk equations are solved
with proper opacities for dust and gas taking into account the huge temperature
variation along the disk. We explore a wide parameter range concerning stellar
mass, accretion rate, and viscosity parameter \alpha . The most essential
finding is a very high temperature of the inner disk. For e.g. a 10 M_sun
protostar and an accretion rate of 10^-4 M_sun/yr, the disk midplane
temperature may reach almost 10^5 K. The disk luminosity in this case is about
10^4 L_sun and, thus, potentially higher than that of a massive protostar. We
motivate our disk model with similarly hot disks around compact stars. We
calculate a dust sublimation radius by turbulent disk self-heating of more than
10AU, a radius, which is 3 times larger than caused by stellar irradiation. We
discuss implications of this result on the flashlight effect and the
consequences for the radiation pressure of the central star. In difference to
disks around low mass protostars our models suggest rather high values for the
disk turbulence parameter \alpha close to unity. However, disk stability to
fragmentation due to thermal effects and gravitational instability would
require a lower \alpha value. For \alpha = 0.1 we find stable disks out to
80AU. Essentially, our model allows to compare the outer disk to some of the
observed massive protostellar disk sources, and from that, extrapolate on the
disk structure close to the star which is yet impossible to observe.

resolution. Images of CO emission with 1.7 to 3"" angular resolution were

sinusoidal time variations related to the Hale-Bopp nucleus rotation of 11.35

direction in the plane of the sky. This suggests the presence of a CO jet,
which is active night and day at about the same extent, and is spiralling with
nucleus rotation. The high quality of the data allows us to constrain the
characteristics of this CO jet. We have developed a 3-D model to interpret the
temporal evolution of CO spectra and maps. The CO coma is represented as the
combination of an isotropic distribution and a spiralling gas jet, both of
nucleus origin. Spectra and visibilities (the direct output of interferometric

with intergalactic radiation fields. This process may result in electromagnetic
cascades with the following cycle: the production of electron-positron pairs
and then secondary gamma-rays due to inverse Compton scattering. Since
electrons and positrons will be scattered in the intergalactic magnetic field,
under certain conditions their radiation may be redirected towards the
observer. Thus one can anticipate that the secondary gamma-ray emission may
produce an apparent extended halo around the source.

wavelength (LWS3) low resolution (LR) spectroscopic mode of the ISAAC camera at
the VLT in the spectral range of the M filter from 4.4micron to 5.1micron. The
use of a slit width of 0.6"" implied a spectral resolution of R=l/Dl=800 (Dv=375
km/s). These observations resulted in M-band spectra of 15 bright sources in
the central stellar cluster of the Milky Way. In addition to gaseous 12^CO
(4.666 micron) and 13^CO (4.77 micron) vibration-rotational absorptions, we
detect a strong absorption due to a mixture of polar and apolar CO ice
(centered at 4.675 micron). In the shorter wavelength absorption wing there is
an absorption feature due to XCN at 4.62 micron. The XCN absorption is
strongest toward the M2 supergiant IRS7. We find that the extinctions due to
material traced by the CO ice and the CO gas absorptions may be of comparable
importance. Using the spectra of IRS2L and IRS16C we perform a first order
correction of the line of sight absorption due to CO-ice and 13^CO gas. In
combination with published hydrogen number density estimates from sub-mm
CO(7-6) and FIR [OI] line data we obtain gas masses of the circumstellar shells
of the order of 10^-3 and 10^-2 solar masses. This implies that in future
spectra taken at high spectral and angular resolution the bright and dust
embedded Galactic Center sources should show a substantial line absorption due
to source intrinsic absorption.

based on a biorthogonal representation (bCC) of the (shifted) Hamiltonian in
terms of excited CC states, also referred to as correlated excited (CE) states,
and an associated set of states biorthogonal to the CE states, the latter being
essentially configuration interaction (CI) configurations. The bCC
representation generates a non-hermitian secular matrix, the eigenvalues
representing excitation energies, while the corresponding spectral intensities
are to be derived from both the left and right eigenvectors. Using the
perspective of the bCC representation, a systematic and comprehensive analysis
of the excited-state CC methods is given, extending and generalizing previous
such studies. Here, the essential topics are the truncation error
characteristics and the separability properties, the latter being crucial for
designing size-consistent approximation schemes. Based on the general order
relations for the bCC secular matrix and the (left and right) eigenvector
matrices, formulas for the perturbation-theoretical (PT) order of the
truncation errors (TEO) are derived for energies, transition moments, and
property matrix elements of arbitrary excitation classes and truncation levels.
In the analysis of the separability properties of the transition moments, the
decisive role of the so-called dual ground state is revealed. Due to the use of
CE states the bCC approach can be compared to so-called intermediate state
representation (ISR) methods based exclusively on suitably orthonormalized CE
states. As the present analysis shows, the bCC approach has decisive advantages
over the conventional CI treatment, but also distinctly weaker TEO and
separability properties in comparison with a full (and hermitian) ISR method.

is also shown that some previously proposed stochastic models are not
compatible with this transport equation in the limit of high particle inertia.
The drift and diffusion parameters of these stochastic differential equations
are then estimated using direct numerical simulation (DNS) data. It is observed
that, contrary to the conventional modeling, they are highly space dependent
and anisotropic. To investigate the performance of the present stochastic
model, a comparison is made with DNS data as well as with two different
stochastic models. A good prediction of the first and second order statistical
moments of the particle and fluid seen velocities is obtained with the three
models considered. Even for some components of the triple particle velocity
correlations, an acceptable accordance is noticed. The performance of the three
different models mainly diverges for the particle concentration and the drift
velocity. The proposed model is seen to be the only one which succeeds in
predicting the good evolution of these latter statistical quantities for the

the closest planet to its star ever imaged, could be formed via core-accretion,
and could explain the main morphological and dynamical properties of the dust

because the observed dust should be naturally placed on inclined orbits by the
combined effect of radiation pressure and mutual collisions. We critically
reinvestigate this issue and numerically estimate what the ""natural"" vertical
thickness of a collisionally evolving disc is, in the absence of any additional
perturbing body. We use a deterministic collisional code, following the
dynamical evolution of a population of indestructible test grains suffering
mutual inelastic impacts. Grain differential sizes as well as the effect of
radiation pressure are taken into account. We find that, under the coupled
effect of radiation pressure and collisions, grains naturally acquire
inclinations of a few degrees. The disc is stratified with respect to grain
sizes, with the smallest grains having the largest vertical dispersion and the
bigger ones clustered closer to the midplane. Debris discs should have a
minimum ""natural"" observed aspect ratio $h_{min}\sim 0.04\pm0.02$ at visible to
mid-IR wavelengths where the flux is dominated by the smallest bound grains.
These values are comparable to the estimated thicknesses of many vertically
resolved debris discs, as is illustrated with the specific example of AU Mic.
For all systems with $h \sim h_{min}$, the presence (or absence) of embedded
perturbing bodies cannot be inferred from the vertical dispersion of the disc

stacked structures are considered. The BLG is a zero-gap semiconductor like the
isolated layer of graphene. We find that while strain alone does not produce a
gap in the BLG, an electric field does so in the Bernal structure but not in
the hexagonal structure. The topology of the bands leads to Dirac circles with
linear dispersion in the case of the hexagonally stacked BLG due to the
interpenetration of the Dirac cones, while for the Bernal stacking, the
dispersion is quadratic. The size of the Dirac circle increases with the
applied electric field, leading to an interesting way of controlling the Fermi
surface. The external electric field is screened due to polarization charges
between the layers, leading to a reduced size of the band gap and the Dirac
circle. The screening is substantial in both cases and diverges for the Bernal
structure for small fields as has been noted by earlier authors. As a biproduct
of this work, we present the tight-binding parameters for the free-standing

made of typical semiconductor materials, even cryogenic temperatures can smear
out the desired transport properties. When the energy distribution of the input
carriers is narrow enough, it turns out that the devices can operate close to
their ideal limits even at relative high temperature. As an example, we present
results for two different networks: one that realizes a Stern-Gerlach device

comprise 7% of the sample. While these estimates are fully compatible with
previous soft gamma-ray surveys, they would appear to be in contrast with
results reported by Risaliti et al. (1999) using an optically selected sample.
This apparent difference can be explained as being due to a selection bias
caused by the reduction in high energy flux in Compton thick objects rendering
them invisible at our sensitivity limit. Taking this into account we estimate
that the fraction of highly absorbed sources is actually in close agreement
with the optically selected sample. Furthermore we show that the measured
fraction of absorbed sources in our sample decreases from 80% to about 20-30%
as a function of redshift with all Compton thick AGN having z < 0.015. If we
limit our analysis to this distance and compare only the type 2 objects in our
sample with the Risaliti et al. objects below this redshift value, we find a
perfect match to their NH distribution. We conclude that in the low redshift
bin we are seeing almost the entire AGN population, from unabsorbed to at least
mildly Compton thick objects, while in the total sample we lose the heavily
absorbed 'counterparts' of distant and therefore dim sources with little or no
absorption. Taking therefore this low z bin as the only one able to provide the
'true' distribution of absorption in type 1 and 2 AGN, we estimate the fraction

can be reversed when averaged over a background variable. Cox and Wermuth
(2003) introduced the concept of distribution dependence between two random
variables X and Y, and developed two dependence conditions, each of which
guarantees that reversal cannot occur. Ma, Xie and Geng (2006) studied the
collapsibility of distribution dependence over a background variable W, under a
rather strong homogeneity condition. Collapsibility ensures the association
remains the same for conditional and marginal models, so that Yule-Simpson
reversal cannot occur. In this paper, we investigate a more general condition
for avoiding effect reversal: A-collapsibility. The conditions of Cox and
Wermuth imply A-collapsibility, without assuming homogeneity. In fact, we show
that, when W is a binary variable, collapsibility is equivalent to
A-collapsibility plus homogeneity, and A-collapsibility is equivalent to the
conditions of Cox and Wermuth. Recently, Cox (2007) extended Cochran's result
on regression coefficients of conditional and marginal models, to quantile
regression coefficients. The conditions of Cox and Wermuth are sufficient for
A-collapsibility of quantile regression coefficients. If the conditional
distribution of W, given Y = y and X = x, belong to one-dimensional natural
exponential family, they are also necessary. Some applications of
A-collapsibility include the analysis of a contingency table, linear regression
models and quantile regression models.

the quantum Hall system. The location of the fixed points in the conductivity
plane is consistent with the global, non-Abelian discrete symmetry $\Gamma
_{0}(2)$, and the renormalisation group (RG) flow-lines agree closely with that
found if the symmetry acts anti-holomorphically. We extend the analysis to
consider the rate of the RG flow. For a specific model in which the $\Gamma
_{0}(2)$ symmetry acts anti-holomorphically the scaling close to the fixed
points gives a critical delocalisation exponent $\nu = 2.38\pm 0.02$, in
excellent greement with direct measurements and with numerical simulations.
Both the predicted flow-lines and the flow rate also agree with the
experimental measurements far away from the critical points, suggesting an
emergent topological structure capable of stabilising the symmetry predictions.
We hope that this agreement will stimulate further experimental study capable
of conclusively testing the symmetry and exploring its associated dynamics.

trigonometric functions, algebraic and hypergeometric functions, as well as
functions defined by integrals, such as the Gaussian error function.

largely from a Higgsless mechanism. As a result, the heavy partners of the
