wavelength limit. Writing down all terms in a gradient (long wavelength)
expansion up to second order for a relativistic system at vanishing charge
density, one obtains the most general (causal) equations of motion for a fluid
in the presence of shear and bulk viscosity, as well as the structure of the
non-equilibrium entropy current. Requiring positivity of the divergence of the
non-equilibrium entropy current relates some of its coefficients to those

between unbiased dots. The other scheme employs the singlet and triplet states
of a biased double dot as the two-level system making up the qubit and exchange
controls the energy splitting of the levels. Exchange in these two

the spherical, stationary, non-streaming Jeans equation has been handled by
assuming a mass profile and fitting models to the observed kinematical data.
Here, the opposite approach is considered: the equation of anisotropic
kinematic projection is inverted for known arbitrary anisotropy to yield the
space radial velocity dispersion profile in terms of an integral involving the
radial profiles of anisotropy and isotropic dynamical pressure. Then, through
the Jeans equation, the mass profile is derived in terms of double integrals of
observable quantities. Single integral formulas for both deprojection and mass
inversion are provided for several simple anisotropy models (isotropic, radial,
circular, general constant, Osipkov-Merritt, Mamon-Lokas and
Diemand-Moore-Stadel). Tests of the mass inversion on NFW models with these
anisotropy models yield accurate results in the case of perfect observational
data, and typically better than 70% (in 4 cases out of 5) accurate mass
profiles for the sampling errors expected from current observational data on
clusters of galaxies. For the NFW model with mildly increasing radial
anisotropy, the mass is found to be insensitive to the adopted anisotropy
profile at 7 scale radii and to the adopted anisotropy radius at 3 scale radii.
This anisotropic mass inversion method is a useful complementary tool to
analyze the mass and anisotropy profiles of spherical systems. It provides the
practical means to lift the MAD in quasi-spherical systems such as globular
clusters, round dwarf spheroidal and elliptical galaxies, as well as groups and
clusters of galaxies, when the anisotropy of the tracer is expected to be
linearly related to the slope of its density.

description of supergravity in (curved) superspace. The gravitational constant
is replaced with the vacuum expectation value of a scalar field, which in local
supersymmetry is promoted to a complex, covariantly chiral scalar superfield.
The imaginary part of this superfield couples to a supersymmetric Holst term.
The Holst term also serves as a starting point in the Loop Quantum Gravity
action. This suggest the possibility of a relation between Loop Quantum Gravity
and supersymmetric string theory, where the Barbero-Immirzi parameter and field
of the former play the role of the supersymmetric axion in the latter. Adding
matter fermions in Loop Quantum Gravity may require the extension of the Holst
action through the Nieh-Yan topological invariant, while in pure, matter-free
supergravity their supersymmetric extensions are the same. We show that, when

and illustrate our arguments using the example of hypothesis testing for
network structure. We invoke a generalized likelihood ratio framework and use
it to highlight the growing number of topics in this area that require strong
contributions from statistical science. We frame our discussion in the context
of previous work from across a variety of disciplines, and conclude by
outlining fundamental statistical challenges whose solutions will in turn serve
to advance the science of network inference.

being mindful of the effect of positrons on FR. Here we derive and interpret
exact expressions of FR for a neutral plasma of arbitrary composition. We focus
on electron-ion-positron plasmas in which charge neutrality is maintained by an
arbitrary combination of ions and positrons. Because a pure electron-positron
plasma has zero FR, the greater the fraction of positrons the higher the field
strength required to account for the same FR. We first obtain general formulae

characteristics of their oscillations in a statistical sense. We aim to
understand the statistical distribution of the frequencies of maximum
oscillation power (nu_max) in red giants and to search for a possible
correlation between nu_max and the large separation (delta_nu). The nu_max
distribution shows a pronounced peak between 20 - 40 microHz. For about half of
the stars we obtain delta_nu with at least two methods. The correlation between
nu_max and delta_nu follows the same scaling relation as inferred for
solar-like stars. The shape of the nu_max distribution can partly be explained
by granulation at low frequencies and by white noise at high frequencies, but
the population density of the observed stars turns out to be also an important
factor. From the fact that the correlation between delta_nu and nu_max for red
giants follows the same scaling relation as obtained for sun-like stars, we
conclude that the sound travel time over the pressure scale height of the
atmosphere scales with the sound travel time through the whole star

which is modeled as both individuals adopting the average of their pre-meeting
beliefs. When all individuals engage in this type of information exchange, the
society will be able to effectively aggregate the initial information held by
all individuals. There is also the possibility of misinformation, however,
because some of the individuals are ""forceful,"" meaning that they influence the
beliefs of (some) of the other individuals they meet, but do not change their
own opinion. The paper characterizes how the presence of forceful agents
interferes with information aggregation. Under the assumption that even
forceful agents obtain some information (however infrequent) from some others

consensus value is a random variable, however, and we characterize its

considered by Goldreich and Ron \cite{GR97}. They give a constant time tester

a $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ lower bound for testers with one-sided error. We design a

recent conjecture of Benjamini, Schramm, and Shapira \cite{BSS08}. The property
of cycle-freeness is closed under the operation of taking minors. This is the
first example of such a property that has an almost optimal
$\otilde(\sqrt{n})$-time one-sided error tester, but has a constant time

stellar clusters, with particular emphasis on tracing the evolution of
primordial (``protoplanetary'') disks through spectroscopic and photometric
diagnostics. The available data demonstrate that the fraction of young stars
with optically thick primordial disks and/or those which show spectroscopic
evidence for accretion appears to approximately follow an exponential decay
with characteristic time ~2.5 Myr (half-life = 1.7 Myr). Large IR surveys of
~2-5 Myr-old stellar samples show that there is real cluster-by-cluster scatter
in the observed disk fractions as a function of age. Recent Spitzer surveys
have found convincing evidence that disk evolution varies by stellar mass and
environment (binarity, proximity to massive stars, and cluster density).
Perhaps most significantly for understanding the planeticity of stars, the disk
fraction decay timescale appears to vary by stellar mass, ranging from ~1 Myr
for >1.3 Msun stars to ~3 Myr for <0.08 Msun brown dwarfs. The exponential
decay function may provide a useful empirical formalism for estimating very
rough ages for YSO populations and for modeling the effects of disk-locking on
the angular momentum of young stars.

of +/-1K across the cloud. The far-IR dust opacity is a factor 2 larger than
the average value for the diffuse ISM. This opacity increase and the
attenuation of the radiation field (RF) both contribute to account for the
lower emission temperature of the large grains. The structure of the TC

the observed colors with model calculations quantifying the impact of the RF
intensity and the abundance of stochastically heated particles on the dust SED.
To match the range of observed colors, we have to invoke variations by a factor
of a few of both the interstellar RF and the abundance of PAHs and VSGs. We
conclude that within this filamentary structure a significant fraction of the

$k[S^7]\rtimes\Z_2^3$ of a Hopf coquasigroup which is noncommutative and
non-trivially Moufang. We use Hopf coquasigroup methods to study differential

fields on $k[S^7]$ we provide a new description of the structure constants of
the Lie algebra $g_2$ in terms of the structure constants $F$ of the octonions.

  Rabbit with Ischaemic Heart Failure","27 pages",,,,"q-bio.TO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: An increased QT/RR slope is hypothesized to be predictive of
sudden cardiac death after myocardial infarction. Previous studies have shown
that beta-adrenergic stimulation increases QT/RR slope, but the effects of
beta-adrenergic stimulation on QT/RR slope in heart failure are unknown.
Methods: New Zealand White rabbits underwent coronary ligation (n=15) or sham
surgery (n=11), and implantation of a pediatric pacemaker lead in the right
ventricle for chronic ECG recording. Eight weeks after surgery, unsedated
rabbits were given intravenous administrations of 0.25 to 2.0 ml of 1
micromol/l isoprenaline, while peak QRS to QRS (RR) and Q to T peak (QT)
intervals were measured. Results: Ligated rabbits (n=6) had lower LVEF than
sham rabbits (n=7, p<.0001), but similar baseline RR (269 +/- 15 vs 292 +/- 23
ms, p=.07), QT (104 +/- 17 vs 91 +/- 9 ms, p=.1) and minimum RR (204 +/- 11 vs
208 +/- 6 ms, p=.4) intervals induced by isoprenaline (0.79 +/- 0.18 vs 0.73
+/- 0.14 ml, p=.6). Hysteresis in QT vs TQ interval plots displayed biphasic
restitution and regions of negative slope. The slope of the positive slope
region was >1 in ligated rabbits (1.27 +/- 0.66) and <1 in sham rabbits (0.35
+/- 0.14, p=.004). Absolute value of the negative slope was greater in ligated
rabbits (-0.81 +/- 0.52 vs -0.35 +/- 0.14, p=.04). Conclusion: Ischaemic heart
failure produces steeper restitution slopes during beta-adrenergically induced
QT/TQ hysteresis. This could underlie the propensity of failing hearts to
arrhythmias.

helps to conserve the total entropy of a system composed of a black hole plus

power spectral density of a continuous time stationary stochastic process,
irregular sampling schemes such as Poisson sampling are often preferred over
regular (uniform) sampling. A major reason for this preference is the
well-known problem of inconsistency of estimators based on regular sampling,
when the underlying power spectral density is not bandlimited. It is argued in
this paper that, in consideration of a large sample property like consistency,
it is natural to allow the sampling rate to go to infinity as the sample size
goes to infinity. Through appropriate asymptotic calculations under this
scenario, it is shown that the smoothed periodogram based on regularly spaced
data is a consistent estimator of the spectral density, even when the latter is
not band-limited. It transpires that, under similar assumptions, the estimators
based on uniformly sampled and Poisson-sampled data have about the same rate of
convergence. Apart from providing this reassuring message, the paper also gives
a guideline for practitioners regarding appropriate choice of the sampling
rate. Theoretical calculations for large samples and Monte-Carlo simulations
for small samples indicate that the smoothed periodogram based on uniformly
sampled data have less variance and more bias than its counterpart based on
Poisson sampled data.

these packing problems admit asymptotic fully polynomial time approximation
schemes (AFPTAS). In bin packing problems, a set of one-dimensional items of
size at most 1 is to be assigned (packed) to subsets of sum at most 1 (bins).
It has been known for a while that the most basic problem admits an AFPTAS. In
this paper, we develop methods that allow to extend this result to other
variants of bin packing. Specifically, the problems which we study in this
paper, for which we design asymptotic fully polynomial time approximation
schemes, are the following. The first problem is ""Bin packing with cardinality
constraints"", where a parameter k is given, such that a bin may contain up to k
items. The goal is to minimize the number of bins used. The second problem is
""Bin packing with rejection"", where every item has a rejection penalty
associated with it. An item needs to be either packed to a bin or rejected, and
the goal is to minimize the number of used bins plus the total rejection
penalty of unpacked items. This resolves the complexity of two important
variants of the bin packing problem. Our approximation schemes use a novel
method for packing the small items. This new method is the core of the improved
running times of our schemes over the running times of the previous results,
which are only asymptotic polynomial time approximation schemes (APTAS).

to be due to oscillations of Comptonizing regions or hot regions embedded in

be very important as they throw lights on the dynamics of the hotter region.
Our aim is to find systems in which there is a well-defined correlation among
the frequencies of the QPOs over a range of time so as to understand the
physical picture. In this paper, we concentrate on the archival data of XTE
J1550-564 obtained during 1998 outburst, and study the systematic drifts during
the rising phase from the 1998 September 7 to the 1998 September 19, when the
QPO frequency increased monotonically from 81mHz to 13.1Hz. Immediately after
that, QPO frequency started to decrease and on the 1998 September 26, the QPO
frequency became 2.62Hz. After that, its value remained almost constant. This
frequency drift can be modelled satisfactorily with a propagatory oscillating
shock solution where the post-shock region behaves as the Comptonized region.
Comparing with the nature of a more recent 2005 outburst of another black hole
candidate GRO 1655-40, where QPOs disappeared at the end of the rising phase,
we conjecture that this so-called `outburst' may not be a full-fledged

profiles of galaxy clusters from kinematic data. The method is based on a model
of the phase space density which allows the anisotropy to vary with radius
between two asymptotic values. The characteristic scale of transition between
these asymptotes is fixed and tuned to a typical anisotropy profile resulting
from cosmological simulations. The model is parametrized by two values of
anisotropy, at the centre of the cluster and at infinity, and two parameters of
the NFW density profile, the scale radius and the scale mass. In order to test
the performance of the method in reconstructing the true cluster parameters we
analyze mock kinematic data for 20 relaxed galaxy clusters generated from a
cosmological simulation of the standard LCDM model. We use Bayesian methods of
inference and the analysis is carried out following the Markov Chain Monte
Carlo approach. The parameters of the mass profile are reproduced quite well,
but we note that the mass is typically underestimated by 15 percent, probably
due to the presence of small velocity substructures. The constraints on the
anisotropy profile for a single cluster are in general barely conclusive.
Although the central asymptotic value is determined accurately, the outer one
is subject to significant systematic errors caused by substructures at large
clustercentric distance. The anisotropy profile is much better constrained if
one performs joint analysis of at least a few clusters. In this case it is
possible to reproduce the radial variation of the anisotropy over two decades
in radius inside the virial sphere.

of a particle by a cavity when the geometry is such that the classical dynamics
is chaotic. This picture is relevant to a variety of physical systems, ranging
from atomic nuclei to mesoscopic systems and microwave cavities; the main
application to be discussed in this contribution is to electronic transport
through mesoscopic ballistic structures or quantum dots. The theory describes
the regime in which there are two distinct time scales, associated with a
prompt and an equilibrated response, and is cast in terms of the matrix of
scattering amplitudes S. We construct the ensemble of S matrices using a
maximum-entropy approach which incorporates the requirements of flux
conservation, causality and ergodicity, and the system-specific average of S
which quantifies the effect of prompt processes. The resulting ensemble, known
as Poisson's kernel, is meant to describe those situations in which any other
information is irrelevant. The results of this formulation have been compared
with the numerical solution of the Schroedinger equation for cavities in which
the assumptions of the theory hold. The model has a remarkable predictive
power: it describes statistical properties of the quantum conductance of
quantum dots, like its average, its fluctuations, and its full distribution in
several cases. We also discuss situations that have been found recently, in
which the notion of stationarity and ergodicity is not fulfilled, and yet
Poisson's kernel gives a good description of the data. At the present moment we

based on the FFT technique, we construct high resolution dynamical maps on the
plane of initial semimajor axis $a_0$ versus inclination $i_0$. These maps show
three most stable regions, with $i_0$ in the range of $(0^\circ,12^\circ),
(22^\circ,36^\circ)$ and $(51^\circ,59^\circ)$ respectively, where the Trojans
are most probably expected to be found. The similarity between the maps for the
leading and trailing triangular Lagrange points $L_4$ and $L_5$ confirms the
dynamical symmetry between these two points. By computing the power spectrum
and the proper frequencies of the Trojan motion, we figure out the mechanisms
that trigger chaos in the motion. The Kozai resonance found at high inclination
varies the eccentricity and inclination of orbits, while the $\nu_8$ secular
resonance around $i_0\sim44^\circ$ pumps up the eccentricity. Both mechanisms
lead to eccentric orbits and encounters with Uranus that introduce strong
perturbation and drive the objects away from the Trojan like orbits. This
explains the clearance of Trojan at high inclination ($>60^\circ$) and an
unstable gap around $44^\circ$ on the dynamical map. An empirical theory is
derived from the numerical results, with which the main secular resonances are
located on the initial plane of $(a_0,i_0)$. The fine structures in the
dynamical maps can be explained by these secular resonances.

on the mathematical theory of deformable porous media. Tumor is modeled as a
saturated mixture of proliferating cells, extracellular fluid and extracellular
matrix, that occupies a spatial region close to a blood vessel whence cells get
the nutrient needed for their vital functions. Growth of tumor cells takes
place within a healthy host tissue, which is in turn modeled as a saturated
mixture of non-proliferating cells. Interactions between these two regions are
accounted for as an essential mechanism for the growth of the tumor mass. By
weakening the role of the extracellular matrix, which is regarded as a rigid
non-remodeling scaffold, a system of two partial differential equations is
derived, describing the evolution of the cell volume ratio coupled to the
dynamics of the nutrient, whose higher and lower concentration levels determine
proliferation or death of tumor cells, respectively. Numerical simulations of a

close to the centre of the distant cluster MACS J1149.5+2223 ($z=0.544$). These
images cover a total area of $\simeq 150 \Box\arcsec$ and are magnified $\simeq
200$ times. Unusually, there is very little image distortion implying the
central mass distribution is almost uniform over a wide area ($r\simeq200 kpc$)
with a surface density equal to the critical density for lensing, corresponding
to maximal lens magnification. Many fainter multiply-lensed galaxies are also
uncovered by our model, outlining a very large tangential critical curve, of
radius $r\simeq 170 kpc$, posing a potential challenge for the standard
LCDM-Cosmology. Because of the uniform central mass distribution a particularly
clean measurement of the mass of the brightest cluster galaxy is possible here,
for which we infer stars contribute most of the mass within a limiting radius
of $\simeq 30 kpc$, with a mass-to-light ratio of $M/L_{B}\simeq
4.5(M/L)_{\odot}$. This cluster with its uniform and central mass distribution
acts analogously to a regular magnifying glass, converging light without
distorting the images, resulting in the most powerful lens yet discovered for
accessing the faint high-$z$ Universe.

studied on mass-symmetric systems by the use of the liquid drop model with the
two-center parameterization. Following the idea that the fusion hindrance
exists only if the liquid drop barrier (saddle point) is located at the inner
side of the contact point after overcoming the outer Coulomb barrier, the
reactions in which two barriers are overlapped with each other are determined.
It is shown that there are many systems where the fusion hindrance does not
exist for the atomic number of projectile or target nucleus $Z\leq43$, while
for $Z>43$, all of the mass-symmetric reactions are fusion-hindered.

dwarf spheroidal galaxies resulting from the tidally induced morphological
transformation of disky dwarfs on a cosmologically motivated eccentric orbit
around the Milky Way. Dwarf galaxy models initially consist of an exponential
stellar disk embedded in an extended spherical dark matter halo. Depending on
the initial orientation of the disk with respect to the orbital plane,
different final configurations are obtained. The least evolved dwarf is
triaxial and retains a significant amount of rotation. The more evolved dwarfs
are prolate spheroids with little rotation. We show that the final density
distribution of stars can be approximated by a simple modification of the
Plummer law. The kinematics of the dwarfs is significantly different depending
on the line of sight which has important implications for mapping the observed
stellar velocity dispersions of dwarfs to subhalo circular velocities. When the
dwarfs are observed along the long axis, the measured velocity dispersion is
higher and decreases faster with radius. In the case where rotation is
significant, when viewed perpendicular to the long axis, the effect of minor
axis rotation is detected, as expected for triaxial systems. We model the
velocity dispersion profiles and rotation curves of the dwarfs by solving the
Jeans equations for spherical and axisymmetric systems and adjusting different
sets of free parameters. We find that the mass is typically overestimated when
the dwarf is seen along the long axis and underestimated when the observation
is along the short or intermediate axis. The effect of non-sphericity cannot
however bias the inferred mass by more than 60 percent in either direction,
even for the most strongly stripped dwarf which is close to disruption.

turn into galaxy clusters. Turbulence produced at expanding void boundaries
causes a linear morphology of 3 kpc fragmenting protogalaxies along vortex
lines. At decoupling galaxies and proto-globular star clusters arise; the
latter constitute the galactic dark matter halos and consist themselves of
earth-mass H-He planets. Frozen planets are observed in microlensing and
white-dwarf-heated ones in planetary nebulae. The approach also explains the

fluctuations of micro-Kelvins.

measures for rooted and unrooted phylogenies. For rooted trees, our measures
are based on the topologies the input trees induce on triplets; that is, on
three-element subsets of the set of species. For unrooted trees, the measures
are based on quartets (four-element subsets). Triplet and quartet-based
distances provide a robust and fine-grained measure of the similarities between
trees. The distinguishing feature of our distance measures relative to
traditional quartet and triplet distances is their ability to deal cleanly with
the presence of unresolved nodes, also called polytomies. For rooted trees,
these are nodes with more than two children; for unrooted trees, they are nodes
of degree greater than three.
  Our first class of measures are parametric distances, where there is a
parameter that weighs the difference between an unresolved triplet/quartet
topology and a resolved one. Our second class of measures are based on
Hausdorff distance. Each tree is viewed as a set of all possible ways in which
the tree could be refined to eliminate unresolved nodes. The distance between
the original (unresolved) trees is then taken to be the Hausdorff distance
between the associated sets of fully resolved trees, where the distance between
trees in the sets is the triplet or quartet distance, as appropriate.

contributions to the magnetoresistance, including those of weak localization
(WL), universal conductance fluctuations (UCF), and inhomogeneous charge
transport. A clear WL signal is evident at all measured gate voltages (in the
hole doped regime) and temperature ranges (from 0.25 K to 4.3 K), and the phase
coherence length extracted from WL data does not saturate at low temperatures.
The WL data is fit to demonstrate that electron-electron Nyquist scattering is
the major source of phase decoherence. A decrease in UCF amplitude with
increasing gate voltage and temperature is shown to be consistent with a
corresponding decrease in the phase coherence length. In addition, a weak
positive magnetoresistance at higher magnetic fields is observed, and
attributed to inhomogeneous charge transport.
