prove that for any embedding of surface operators in a general, twisted N=2
pure abelian theory on an arbitrary four-manifold, the parameters transform
naturally under the SL(2,Z) duality of the theory. However, for
nontrivially-embedded surface operators, exact S-duality holds if and only if
the ""quantum"" parameter effectively vanishes, while the overall SL(2,Z) duality
holds up to a c-number at most, regardless. Nevertheless, this observation sets
the stage for a physical proof of a remarkable mathematical result by
Kronheimer and Mrowka--that expresses a ""ramified"" analog of the Donaldson
invariants solely in terms of the ordinary Donaldson invariants--which, will
appear, among other things, in forthcoming work. As a prelude to that, the
effective interaction on the corresponding u-plane will be computed. In
addition, the dependence on second Stiefel-Whitney classes and the appearance
of a Spin^c structure in the associated low-energy Seiberg-Witten theory with
surface operators, will also be demonstrated. In the process, we will stumble
upon an interesting phase factor that is otherwise absent in the ""unramified""
case.

oscillations (BAO) in Lyman alpha forest data containing 180,000 mock quasar

paint the Lyman alpha field using the fluctuating Gunn-Peterson approximation.
We argue that this approach should be sufficient for the mean signature on the
scales of interest. Our results indicate that Lyman alpha flux provides a good
tracer of the underlying dark matter field on large scales and that redshift
space distortions are well described by a simple linear theory prescription. We
compare Fourier and configuration space approaches to describing the signal and
argue that configuration space statistics provide useful data compression. We
also investigate the effect of a fluctuating photo-ionizing background using a
simplified model and find that such fluctuations do add smooth power on large
scales. The acoustic peak position is, however, unaffected for small amplitude
fluctuations (<10%). Larger amplitude fluctuations make the recovery of the BAO
signal more difficult and may degrade the achievable significance of the
measurement.

temperatures. We introduce ``calorons with a nontrivial holonomy'' that are
generalizations of instantons and can be viewed as ``made of'' constituent
dyons. The quantum weight with which these calorons contribute to the
Yang--Mills partition function is considered, and the ensuing statistical
mechanics of the ensemble of interacting dyons is discussed. We argue that a
simple semiclassical picture based on dyons satisfies all known criteria of
confinement and explains the confinement-deconfinement phase transition. This
refers not only to the SU(N) gauge groups where dyons lead to the expected
behaviour of the observables with N, but also to the exceptional G(2) group
whose group center, unlike SU(N), is trivial. Despite being centerless, the
G(2) gauge group possesses confinement at low temperatures, and a 1st order
deconfinement transition, according to several latest lattice simulations,
indicating that confinement-deconfinement is not related to the group center.
Dyons, however, reproduce this behaviour.

very little the security options from the previously available library. The
largest flaw remained that no function asked for the buffer size of destination
buffers for any function copying data into a user-supplied buffer. According to
earlier research we performed, we know that error condition handling was the
first solution to security vulnerabilities, followed by precondition
validation. The standard C functions typically perform little precondition
validation and error handling, allowing for a wide range of security issues to
be introduced in their use. ISO/IEC TR 24731, titled as ""TR 24731: Safer C
library functions"", defines 41 new library functions for memory copying, string
handling (both for normal and wide character strings), time printing, sorting,
searching etc. Another innovation it brings is a constraint handling
architecture, forcing error handling when certain security-related
preconditions are violated when the functions are called. It also specifies the
null-termination of all strings manipulated through its function and introduces
a new unsigned integer type that helps preventing integer overflows and
underflows. It is currently implemented by Microsoft as part of their Visual

continuously expand or contract coronal holes. The changes appear to be random
on a time scale comparable with the lifetime of the loops seen at these

loops (10"" - 40"" and smaller) which are abundant along coronal hole boundaries

real trading that occur in discrete-time, and this is formulated as an impulse

paper is to show that nearly optimal execution strategies in this context lead
actually to a finite number of trading times, and this holds true without
assuming ad hoc any fixed transaction fee. Next, we derive the dynamic
programming quasi-variational inequality satisfied by the value function in the

time of rupture is found to decrease with system size, in agreement with
classical Weibull theory. In the case of zero shear modulus, the energy
opposing rupture is identified with the breakage of a single atomic layer. In
the case of non-zero shear modulus, thermally activated fracture can only be
studied within a reasonable time at very high strains. In this case the energy
barrier involves the stretching of bonds within several layers, accounting for
a much higher barrier compared to the zero shear modulus case. This barrier is

reduction of astrometric operations. This technique of astrometry is
triangulation of star positions. Since angles are deduced from the baseline and
delay side of these triangles, length and pointing direction (in the celestial
sphere) of the baseline vector at the time of observation are key input data.
We assume that calibration follows from reverse astrometry; a set of calibrator
stars with well-known positions is observed and inaccuracies in these positions
are leveled by observing many of them for a common best fit.
  The errors in baseline length and orientation angles drop proportional to the
inverse square roots of the number of independent data taken, proportional to
the errors in the individual snapshots of the delay, and proportional to the
errors in the apparent positions of the calibrators. Scheduling becomes
important if the baseline components are reconstructed from the sinusoidal

slow and fast spin cases (corresponding to long and short distances between

especially in the case of short distances, occultation of one faint object by
the other, while the transit of the planet-companion system occurs in front of
its parent star, causes an apparent increase in light curves and characteristic
fluctuations appear as important evidence of mutual transits. We show also that
extrasolar mutual transits provide a complementary method of measuring the
radii of two transiting objects, their separation and mass, and consequently
identifying them as a true binary, planet-satellite system or others.

main-sequence donor star. Recent X-ray observations suggested that the compact
object in 4U 2206+54 may be a neutron star. The X-ray emission comes from the
accretion of stellar winds from the massive donor stars, and variability of
luminosity may be due to the changes of its orbit phase. To further reveal the
nature of compact object, we studied 4U 2206+54 with INTEGRAL/IBIS observations
in two years, and found that in most time, 4U 2206+54 undergone a quiescent
state and sometime an active state. In the quiescent state the spectrum can be
fitted by a power-law model of $\Gamma\sim 2.1$ with a hard X-ray luminosity of
$\sim 5\times 10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (20-- 100 keV). While in the active state,
the 20-- 100 keV hard X-ray luminosity reaches $\sim 2\times 10^{35}$ erg
s$^{-1}$ and the spectrum is fitted by a thermal bremmstrahlung model of
$kT\sim 43$ keV plus two cyclotron absorption lines at $\sim$ 30 and 60 keV.
Then we derived a magnetic field of 3.3$\times 10^{12}$ G for the compact
object in 4U 2206+54. During the active state, we found a pulsation period of
$\sim$ 5400 s in the light curve of 4U 2206+54. So the compact object in 4U
2206+54 should be a magnetic neutron star with a slow pulsation. Cyclotron
absorption lines detected in the active state and non-detection in the
quiescent state suggested that two different accretion states have possible
different hard X-ray emission regions: surface of neutron star in the active
state; the magnetic-accretion pressure equivalent point in the quiescent state.
The re-analysis of the RXTE/ASM light curve found the modulation periods at
$\sim 9.56$ days and 19.11 days, and the orbit period of 4U 2206+54 should be
19.11 days.

low-velocity minibands appear near the charge neutrality point. For higher

contrast, for corrugated ribbons with the zigzag host, the corrugations
introduce neither band gaps nor stopbands (except for the case of the

analyzed on the basis of the corresponding band structures. For a sufficiently

the Fabry-Perot interference within the corrugated segments. Finally we
demonstrate that edge disorder strongly affects the conductances of corrugated

generalize the dynamical systems study of tachyon cosmology to a wider class of
self-interaction potentials beyond the (inverse) square-law one. It is revealed
that independent of the functional form of the potential, the matter-dominated

critical point. For inverse power-law potentials $V\propto\phi^{-2\lambda}$ the
late-time attractor is always the de Sitter solution, while for sinh-like
potentials $V\propto\sinh^{-\alpha}(\lambda\phi)$, depending on the region of
parameter space, the late-time attractor can be either the inflationary
tachyon-dominated solution or the matter-scaling (also inflationary) phase. In
general, for most part of known quintessential potentials, the late-time

operated by CNES. This work presents the results obtained on HD 50844: the
140,016 datapoints were analysed using independent approaches and several
checks performed. A level of 10^{-5} mag was reached in the amplitude spectra
of the CoRoT timeseries. The frequency analysis of the CoRoT timeseries
revealed hundreds of terms in the frequency range 0--30 d^{-1}. All the
cross--checks confirmed this new result. The initial guess that Delta Sct stars
have a very rich frequency content is confirmed. The spectroscopic mode
identification gives theoretical support since very high--degree modes (up to
ell=14) are identified. We also prove that cancellation effects are not
sufficient in removing the flux variations associated to these modes at the
noise level of the CoRoT measurements. The ground--based observations indicate
that HD 50844 is an evolved star that is slightly underabundant in heavy
elements, located on the Terminal Age Main Sequence. Probably due to this
unfavourable evolutionary status, no clear regular distribution is observed in
the frequency set. The predominant term (f_1=6.92 d^{-1}) has been identified

spectroscopic data. This work is also based on observations made with ESO

muonic and exotic atoms are considered. The corrections are due to the
electronic vacuum polarization. Such corrections are of interest due to various
effective approaches, which take into account QED and hadronic effects. The
wave function at origin plays a key role in the calculation of the pionium
lifetime, various finite nuclear size effects and the hyperfine splitting. The
results are obtained for the $1s$ and $2s$ states in pionic and muonic hydrogen

Applications to the hyperfine structure and the Lamb shift in muonic hydrogen

charge, one obtained from the pinch technique gluon self-energy, and one from
the ghost-gluon vertex. Despite their distinct theoretical origin, due to a
fundamental identity relating various of the ingredients appearing in their
respective definitions, the two effective charges are almost identical in the
entire range of physical momenta, and coincide exactly in the deep infrared,
where they freeze at a common finite value. Specifically, the dressing function
of the ghost propagator is related to the two form factors in the Lorentz
decomposition of a certain Green's function, appearing in a variety of
field-theoretic contexts. The central identity, which is valid only in the
Landau gauge, is derived from the Schwinger-Dyson equations governing the
dynamics of the aforementioned quantities. The renormalization procedure that
preserves the validity of the identity is carried out, and various relevant
kinematic limits and physically motivated approximations are studied in detail.
A crucial ingredient in this analysis is the infrared finiteness of the gluon
propagator, which is inextricably connected with the aforementioned freezing of
the effective charges. Some important issues related to the consistent
definition of the effective charge in the presence of such a gluon propagator
are resolved. We finally present a detailed numerical study of a special set of
Schwinger-Dyson equations, whose solutions determine the non-perturbative
dynamics of the quantities composing the two effective charges.

no evident interclump emission to clump clusters with faint red disks, to
spiral galaxies of the flocculent or grand design types. Along this sequence,
the interclump surface density increases and the mass surface density contrast
between the clumps and the interclump regions decreases, suggesting a gradual
dispersal of clumps to form disks. Also along this sequence, the bulge-to-clump

All of these morphological types occur in the same redshift range, indicating
that the clump cluster morphology is not the result of bandshifting.
Comparisons to local galaxies with the same rest wavelength and spatial

from gravitational instabilities in gas with a high turbulent speed compared to
the rotation speed and a high mass fraction compared to the stars.

The dataset allows us to study the evolution of several magnetic features

cancellation of G-band bright points. Our analysis is based on a SIR inversion
of the Stokes I and V profiles of both Fe I lines. The high spatial resolution
of the G-band images combined with the inversion results helps to interpret the
undergoing physical processes. The appearance (dissolution) of high-contrast
G-band bright points is found to be related to the local increase (decrease) of
the magnetic filling factor, without appreciable changes in the field strength.
The cancellation of opposite-polarity bright points can be the signature of
either magnetic reconnection or the emergence/submergence of magnetic loops.

following the catastrophe invokes the velocity vortices behind the rope, and
may invoke as well slow and fast mode shocks in front of the rope. The velocity
vortices at each side of the flux rope propagate roughly horizontally away from

two echoes moving back into the corona, but the slow one and the vortices
totally decay somewhere in the lower corona before arriving the bottom

disturbance that accounts for the Moreton wave observed in Halpha, and the
disturbance in the corona caused by the slow shock and the velocity vortices
should account for the EIT wave whose speed is about 40% that of the Moreton

At moderate packing fractions, the intruder moves rapidly as soon as the force
is applied. Above some threshold value of the packing fraction which increases
with the applied force, the intruder exhibits an intermittent creep motion with
strong fluctuations reminiscent of a crackling noise signal. These fluctuations
behave in a critical manner at the jamming transition unveilled in a previous
study. The transition separates a regime where the intruder motion is dominated
by local free volume rearrangements from a regime where the instantaneous
displacement field is strongly heterogeneous and resemble the force chains

an open-ended gapless section in the large Fermi surface, rather than a closed
loop expected of an ordinary metal. This is all the more puzzling because Fermi
pockets (small closed Fermi surface features) have been suggested from recent
quantum oscillation measurements. The Fermi arcs have worried the high-Tc
community for many years because they cannot be understood in terms of existing

surface pockets associated with competing order, with a back side that is for
detailed reasons invisible by photoemission. Here we report ARPES measurements
of La-Bi2201 that give direct evidence of the Fermi pocket. The charge carriers
in the pocket are holes and the pockets show an unusual dependence upon doping,

that these Fermi pockets appear to coexist with the Fermi arcs. This
coexistence has not been expected theoretically and the understanding of the

minimally coupled with its counterpart, allowing high fidelity excitation

first show that simple tuning can lead to emission of near-Gaussian

decay in a passive cavity-based system. The influences of cavity loss and
atomic spontaneous emission are studied in detailed numerical simulations,
showing the practicality of these schemes within the reach of current

prototypical non-square Klein-Gordon lattices, namely a honeycomb and a
hexagonal one. In the honeycomb case we consider six-site configurations and
find that for soft potential and positive coupling the out-of-phase breather
configuration and the charge-two vortex breather are linearly stable, while the
in-phase and charge-one vortex states are unstable. In the hexagonal lattice,
we first consider three-site configurations. In the case of soft potential and
positive coupling, the in-phase configuration is unstable and the charge-one
vortex is linearly stable. The out-of-phase configuration here is found to
always be linearly unstable. We then turn to six-site configurations in the
hexagonal lattice. The stability results in this case are the same as in the
six-site configurations in the honeycomb lattice. For all configurations in
both lattices, the stability results are reversed in the setting of either hard
potential or negative coupling. The study is complemented by numerical
simulations which are in very good agreement with the theoretical predictions.

parameter involved have been prescribed, this description can accommodate
inverse-dispersive systems (e.g., supporting backward waves) such as transverse

weak bisimilarity is a congruence. Then, we apply such extended RPO technique
to the lambda-calculus, endowed with lazy and call by value reduction
strategies.
  We show that, contrary to process calculi, one can deal directly with the
lambda-calculus syntax and apply Leifer-Milner technique to a category of
contexts, provided that we work in the framework of weak bisimilarities.
  However, even in the case of the transition system with minimal contexts, the
resulting bisimilarity is infinitely branching, due to the fact that, in
standard context categories, parametric rules such as the beta-rule can be
represented only by infinitely many ground rules.
  To overcome this problem, we introduce the general notion of second-order
context category. We show that, by carrying out the RPO construction in this
setting, the lazy observational equivalence can be captured as a weak
bisimilarity equivalence on a finitely branching transition system. This result
is achieved by considering an encoding of lambda-calculus in Combinatory Logic.

Newton polytope $\Delta$. It is well known that the spine of its amoeba has a
structure of a tropical hypersurface. We prove in this paper that there exists
a complex tropical hypersurface $V_{\infty, f}$ such that its coamoeba is
homeomorphic to the closure in the real torus of the coamoeba of $V$. Moreover,
the coamoeba of $V_{\infty, f}$ contains an arrangement of $(n-1)$-torus
depending only on the geometry of $\Delta$ and the coefficients of $f$. In
addition, we can consider this arrangement, as a weighted codual hyperplanes
arrangement in the universal covering of the real torus, and the balancing
condition (the analogous to that of tropical hypersurfaces) is satisfied. This
codual hyperplanes arrangement is called the {\em shell} of the complex
coamoeba (the cousin of the spine of the complex amoeba). %(or the {\em average
contour} of the complex coamoeba). Using this combinatorial coamoebas
structure, we show that the amoebas of complex algebraic hypersurfaces defined
by maximally sparse polynomials are solid. More precisely, we characterize the
image of the order map defined by Forsberg, Passare, and Tsikh.

distances and early times.

extension criterion for separability. First, we show that a perturbation of
order O(1/N) is sufficient and, in general, necessary to destroy the
entanglement of any state admitting an N Bose symmetric extension. On the other
hand, the minimum amount of local noise necessary to induce separability on
states arising from N Bose symmetric extensions with Positive Partial Transpose
(PPT) decreases at least as fast as O(1/N^2). From these results, we derive
upper bounds on the time and space complexity of the weak membership problem of
separability when attacked via algorithms that search for PPT symmetric
extensions. Finally, we show how to estimate the error we incur when we
approximate the set of separable states by the set of (PPT) N -extendable
quantum states in order to compute the maximum average fidelity in pure state
estimation problems, the maximal output purity of quantum channels, and the
geometric measure of entanglement.

doublets of $d^1$-ions on a square lattice. We find that the system exhibits a
magnetically hidden order in which the expectation values of the local spin and
orbital moments both vanish. The order parameter responsible for a
time-reversal symmetry breaking has a composite nature and is a spin-orbital
analog of a magnetic octupole. We argue that such a hidden order is realized in
the layered perovskite Sr$_2$VO$_4$.
