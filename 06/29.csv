anisotropy of hopping integrals for a tight-binding model on the honeycomb
lattice in a magnetic field. The condition for the existence of zero modes is
analytically derived. From the condition, it is found that a tiny anisotropy
for graphene is sufficient to open a gap around zero energy in a magnetic
field. This gap behaves as a non-perturbative and exponential form as a
function of the magnetic field. The non-analytic behavior with respect to the
magnetic field can be understood as tunneling effects between energy levels
around two Dirac zero modes appearing in the honeycomb lattice, and an explicit
form of the gap around zero energy is obtained by the WKB method near the
merging point of these Dirac zero modes. Effects of the anisotropy for the
honeycomb lattices with boundaries are also studied. The condition for the
existence of zero energy edge states in a magnetic field is analytically
derived. On the basis of the condition, it is recognized that anisotropy of the
hopping integrals induces abrupt changes of the number of zero energy edge
states, which depend on the shapes of the edges sensitively.

We consider the version without the detailed balance condition with the
projectability condition and address one aspect of the theory: avoidance of
caustics for constant time hypersurfaces. We show that there is no caustic with
plane symmetry in the absence of matter source if \lambda\ne 1. If \lambda=1 is
a stable IR fixed point of the renormalization group flow then \lambda is
expected to deviate from 1 near would-be caustics, where the extrinsic
curvature increases and high-energy corrections become important. Therefore,
the absence of caustics with \lambda\ne 1 implies that caustics cannot form
with this symmetry in the absence of matter source. We argue that inclusion of
matter source will not change the conclusion. We also argue that caustics with
codimension higher than one will not form because of repulsive gravity
generated by nonlinear higher curvature terms. These arguments support our
conjecture that there is no caustic for constant time hypersurfaces. Finally,
we discuss implications to the recently proposed scenario of ``dark matter as
integration constant''.

of the locales of which the Stone-Cech compactification can be defined in
constructive type theory CTT, and in the formal system CZF+uREA+DC, a natural
extension of Aczel's system for constructive set theory CZF by a strengthening
of the Regular Extension Axiom REA and the principle of dependent choice. In
this paper I show that this characterization continues to hold over the
standard system CZF plus REA, thus removing in particular any dependency from a
choice principle. This will follow by a result of independent interest, namely
the proof that the class of continuous mappings from a compact regular locale X
to a regular a set-presented locale Y is a set in CZF, even without REA. It is
then shown that the existence of Stone-Cech compactification of a
non-degenerate Boolean locale is independent of the axioms of CZF (+REA), so
that the obtained characterization characterizes a proper subcollection of the
collection of all locales. The same also holds for several, even impredicative,
extensions of CZF+REA, as well as for CTT. This is in contrast with what
happens in the context of Higher-order Heyting arithmetic HHA - and thus in any

  We used the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope to observe the J=4-3 transition of

N_J=3_{5/2}-2_{5/2}, in NGC 1068.
  We estimate the excitation conditions of HCN, HNC, and CN, based on the line
intensity ratios and radiative transfer models.
  We find that the bulk emission of HCN, HNC, CN, and the high-J HCO+ emerge
from dense gas n(H_2)>=10^5 cm^-3). However, the low-J HCO+ lines (dominating
the HCO+ column density) trace less dense (n(H_2)<10^5 cm^-3) and colder
(T_K<=20 K) gas, whereas the high-J HCO+ emerges from warmer (>30 K) gas than
the other molecules.
  The HCO+ J=4-3 line intensity, compared with the lower transition lines and
with the HCN J=4-3 line, support the influence of a local XDR environment. The
estimated N(CN)/N(HCN)~1-4 column density ratios are indicative of an XDR/AGN

non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories with fermions in arbitrary chiral or
vectorlike representations. We use the presence or absence of mass gap for
gauge fluctuations as an identifier of the infrared behavior. Present-day
understanding does not allow the mass gap for gauge fluctuations to be computed
on R*4. However, recent progress allows its non-perturbative computation on
R*3xS*1 by using either the twisted partition function or deformation theory,
for a range of S*1 sizes depending on the theory. For small number of fermions,
Nf, we show that the mass gap increases with increasing radius, due to the
non-dilution of monopoles and bions, the topological excitations relevant for
confinement on R*3xS*1. For sufficiently large Nf, we show that the mass gap
decreases with increasing radius. In a class of theories, we claim that the
decompactification limit can be taken while remaining within the region of
validity of semi-classical techniques, giving the first examples of
semiclassically solvable Yang-Mills theories at any size S*1. For general
non-supersymmetric vectorlike or chiral theories, we conjecture that the change
in the behavior of the mass gap on R*3xS*1 as a function of the radius occurs
near the lower boundary of the conformal window and give non-perturbative
estimates of its value. For vectorlike theories, we compare our estimates of
the conformal window with existing lattice results, truncations of the
Schwinger-Dyson equations, NSVZ beta function-inspired estimates, and degree of
freedom counting criteria. For multi-generation chiral gauge theories, to the
best of our knowledge, our estimates of the conformal window are the only known

are theoretically analysed.
  Methods. An explicitly time-dependent, nonlinear kinetic model of cosmic ray
(CR) acceleration in SNRs is used to describe the properties of SNR RX
J0852.0-4622, the accelerated CRs and the nonthermal emission. The source is
assumed to be at a distance of ~1 kpc in the wind bubble of a massive
progenitor star. An estimate of the thermal X-ray flux in such a configuration
is given.
  Results. We find that the overall synchrotron spectrum of RX J0852.0-4622 as
well as the filamentary structures in hard X-rays lead to an amplified magnetic
field B > 100 muG in the SNR interior. This implies that the leptonic very high
energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission is suppressed, and that the VHE gamma-rays are
hadronically dominated. The energy spectrum of protons produced over the
life-time of the remnant until now may well reach ''knee'' energies. The
derived gamma-ray morphology is consistent with the H.E.S.S. measurements. The
amount of energy in energetic particles corresponds to about 35% of the
hydrodynamic explosion energy. A remaining uncertainty concerns the thermal
X-ray flux at 1 keV. A rough estimate, possibly not quite appropriate for the
assumed wind bubble configuration, results in it being larger than the
nonthermal flux at this energy.
  Conclusions. It is concluded that this SNR expanding into the wind bubble of
a massive star in a dense gas environment can be a hadronic gamma-ray source
that is consistent with all existing multi-wavelength constraints, except
possibly the thermal X-ray emission.

proportional to the star formation rate (SFR) which is directly related to the
halo mass accretion rate. The only free parameter in our model is then the
star-formation efficiency (SFE). An efficiency of 2.5% provides the best-fit to
the Ly-alpha luminosity function (LF) at redshift z=3.1, and we use this SFE to
construct Ly-alpha LFs at other redshifts. Our model reproduce the Ly-alpha
LFs, stellar ages, SFR ~1-10; Msun/yr, stellar masses ~ 10^7-10^8 Msun and the
clustering properties of LAEs at z~3-7. We find the spatial correlation lengths
ro ~ 3-6 Mpc/h, in agreement with the observations. Finally, we estimate the
field-to-field variation ~ 30% for current volume and flux limited surveys,
again consistent with observations. Our results suggest that the star
formation, and hence Ly-alpha emission in LAEs is powered by the accretion of
new material, and that the physical properties of LAEs do not evolve
significantly over a wide range of redshifts. Relating the accreted mass,
rather than the total mass of halos, to the Ly-alpha luminosity of LAEs
naturally gives rise to the duty cycle of LAEs.

sphericity, local density and filtering scale. It is shown that the majority of

increases, as the proto-halo's mass increases, and as the local density becomes
close to the critical value, delta_{ec}. It is also found that those peculiar

which is consistent with the linear tidal torque theory. In the light of our
results, it is intriguing to speculate a hypothesis that the low surface

proto-halos with extreme low-sphericity whose inertia tensors are weakly

dedicated to this topic.
  The primary goal is a study of a simple version of general nonlinear integer
problems, where all constraints are still linear. Our focus is on the
computational complexity of the problem, which varies significantly with the
type of nonlinear objective function in combination with the underlying
combinatorial structure. Numerous boundary cases of complexity emerge, which
sometimes surprisingly lead even to polynomial time algorithms.
  We also cover recent successful approaches for more general classes of
problems. Though no positive theoretical efficiency results are available, nor
are they likely to ever be available, these seem to be the currently most
successful and interesting approaches for solving practical problems.
  It is our belief that the study of algorithms motivated by theoretical
considerations and those motivated by our desire to solve practical instances
should and do inform one another. So it is with this viewpoint that we present
the subject, and it is in this direction that we hope to spark further
research.

selectivity of both DEEA Ca channels and DEKA Na channels in many ionic
solutions of different composition and concentration. Only the side chains are
different in the model of the Ca and Na channels. Parameters are the same for
both channels in all solutions. 'Pauling' radii are used for ions. No
information from crystal structures is used in the model. Side chains are
grossly approximated as spheres. The predicted properties of the Na and Ca
channels are very different. How can such a simple model give such powerful
results when chemical intuition says that selectivity depends on the precise
relation of ions and side chains? We use Monte Carlo simulations of this model
that determine the most stable-lowest free energy-structure of the ions and
side chains. Structure is the computed consequence of the forces in this model.
The relationship of ions and side chains vary with ionic solution and are very
different in simulations of the Na and Ca channels. Selectivity is a
consequence of the 'induced fit' of side chains to ions and depends on the
flexibility (entropy) of the side chains as well as their location. The model
captures the relation of side chains and ions well enough to account for
selectivity of both Na channels and Ca channels in the wide range of conditions
measured in experiments. Evidently, the structures in the real Na and Ca
channels responsible for selectivity are self-organized, at their free energy
minimum. Oversimplified models are enough to account for selectivity if the
models calculate the 'most stable' structure as it changes from solution to
solution, and mutation to mutation.

obstruction within the general framework of Khovanov homology, changes this
state of affairs. We studied a class of knots K for which nonzero s(K) would
yield a counterexample to SPC4. Computations are extremely costly and we had
only completed two tests for those K, with the computations showing that s was
0, when a landmark posting of Akbulut (arXiv:0907.0136) altered the terrain.
His posting, appearing only six days after our initial posting, proved that the
family of ``Cappell--Shaneson'' homotopy spheres that we had geared up to study
were in fact all standard. The method we describe remains viable but will have
to be applied to other examples. Akbulut's work makes SPC4 seem more plausible,
and in another section of this paper we explain that SPC4 is equivalent to an
appropriate generalization of Property R (``in S^3, only an unknot can yield
S^1 x S^2 under surgery''). We hope that this observation, and the rich
relations between Property R and ideas such as taut foliations, contact
geometry, and Heegaard Floer homology, will encourage 3-manifold topologists to
look at SPC4.

show that Jain's composite Fermion (CF) picture is valid only if the conditions
necessary for Laughlin correlations are satisfied, and we present a rigorous

dimensional nonlinear manifolds, which includes a phase of unsupervised basis
learning and a phase of supervised function learning. The learned bases provide
a set of anchor points to form a local coordinate system, such that each data
point $x$ on the manifold can be locally approximated by a linear combination
of its nearby anchor points, with the linear weights offering a
local-coordinate coding of $x$. We show that a high dimensional nonlinear
function can be approximated by a global linear function with respect to this
coding scheme, and the approximation quality is ensured by the locality of such
coding. The method turns a difficult nonlinear learning problem into a simple
global linear learning problem, which overcomes some drawbacks of traditional
local learning methods. The work also gives a theoretical justification to the
empirical success of some biologically-inspired models using sparse coding of
sensory data, since a local coding scheme must be sufficiently sparse. However,
sparsity does not always satisfy locality conditions, and can thus possibly
lead to suboptimal results. The properties and performances of the method are
empirically verified on synthetic data, handwritten digit classification, and
object recognition tasks.

the resistivity. For x >= 0.4, gamma approaches to ~ 5 mJ/K^2 mol or less,

derived from maximal lattice point free polyhedra of the form $S:=\{x : \pi_0
\leq \pi^T x \leq \pi_0+1 \}$ called split sets. The set obtained by adding all
split cuts is called the split closure, and the split closure is known to be a
polyhedron. A split set $S$ has max-facet-width equal to one in the sense that
$\max\{\pi^T x : x \in S \}-\min\{\pi^T x : x \in S \} \leq 1$. In this paper
we consider using general lattice point free rational polyhedra to derive valid
cuts for mixed integer linear sets. We say that lattice point free polyhedra
with max-facet-width equal to $w$ have width size $w$. A split cut of width
size $w$ is then a valid inequality whose validity follows from a lattice point
free rational polyhedron of width size $w$. The $w$-th split closure is the set
obtained by adding all valid inequalities of width size at most $w$. Our main
result is a sufficient condition for the addition of a family of rational
inequalities to result in a polyhedral relaxation. We then show that a
corollary is that the $w$-th split closure is a polyhedron. Given this result,
a natural question is which width size $w^*$ is required to design a finite
cutting plane proof for the validity of an inequality. Specifically, for this
value $w^*$, a finite cutting plane proof exists that uses lattice point free
rational polyhedra of width size at most $w^*$, but no finite cutting plane
proof that only uses lattice point free rational polyhedra of width size
smaller than $w^*$. We characterize $w^*$ based on the faces of the linear
relaxation.

The Cygnus OB2 association, the central engine of the Cygnus X
star-forming region, is the subject of an extensive INTEGRAL Key Project that

Becker and co-workers provides the most sensitive limit yet obtained on hard
X-ray emission from the cluster. Aims. We investigate the X-ray emission in the
20-40 keV band expected from the flaring low-mass stellar population in Cygnus
OB2. We discuss whether such emission needs to be considered in the
interpretation of existing and future X-ray observations of the region, and
whether such observations might provide insight into the high-energy processes
on low-mass pre-main sequence stars. Methods. The total hard X-ray flux from
low-mass stars is estimated by assuming the observed soft X-ray emission stems
from a superposition of flares. We further assume the ratio of hard X-ray to
soft X-ray emission is described by a scaling found for solar flares by Isola

the 20-40 keV band to lie in the range ~2x10^31-6x10^32 erg/s and discuss some
potential biases that might affect this result. Conclusions. Hard X-ray
emission could lie at a level not much below the current observed flux upper
limits for Cygnus OB2. If this emission could be detected, it would provide
insight into the hard X-ray production of large flares on pre-main sequence
stars. We highlight the penetrating power of hard X-rays from low-mass stellar
populations as a possible pointer to our Galaxy's hidden star-forming clusters

turbulence, such as the teardrop shape of the R-Q plane. Unfortunately, non

aligned with the wrong eigenvector of the deformation. We then show that
slightly modifying the former vectorial field in order to impose the long range

difficult task, experimental quantification of entanglement is even more
challenging, and has not yet been studied thoroughly. In this paper we discuss
several issues concerning bounds on concurrence measurable collectively on

concurrence by Mintert--Buchleitner [F. Mintert and A. Buchleitner, Phys. Rev.
Lett. 98, 140505 (2007)]. Relating it to the reduction criterion for
separability we provide yet another proof of the bound and point out some
possibilities following from the proof which could lead to improvement of the
bound. Then, relating concurrence to the generalized robustness of
entanglement, we provide a method allowing for construction of lower bounds on
concurrence from any positive map (not only the reduction one). All these
quantities can be measured as mean values of some two--copy observables. In
this sense the method generalizes the Mintert--Buchleitner bound and recovers
it when the reduction map is used. As a particular case we investigate the
bound obtained from the transposition map. Interestingly, comparison with MB
bound performed on the class of 4\otimes 4 rotationally invariant states shows
that the new bound is positive in regions in which the MB bound gives zero.
Finally, we provide measurable upper bounds on the whole class of concurrences.

that cannot be ascribed to non-LTE effects. The discrepancies obtained for O

luminous galaxies in the Spitzer extragalactic first look survey obtained with
IRS on board Spitzer. The sample is selected to be brighter than ~0.9 mJy at 24
micron and it has a z distribution in the range [0.3,3.5] with a peak at z=1.
It primarily comprises ultraluminous IR galaxies at z>1 and luminous IR
galaxies at z<1, as estimated from their monochromatic 14 micron luminosities.
The number of sources with spectra that are dominated by an active galactic
nucleus (AGN) continuum is 49, while 39 sources have strong, star-formation
related features. For this classification, we used the equivalent width (EW) of
the 11.3 micron polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) feature. Several
intermediate/high z starbursts have higher PAH EW than local ULIRGs. An
increase in the AGN activity is observed with increasing z and luminosity,
based on the decreasing EW of PAHs and the increasing [NeIII]/[NeII] ratio.
Spectral stacking leads to the detection of the 3.3 micron PAH, the H2 0-0 S(1)
and S(3) lines, and the [NeV] line. We observe differences in the flux ratios
of PAHs in the stacked spectra of IR-luminous galaxies with z or luminosity,
which are not due to extinction effects. When placing the observed galaxies on
IR color-color diagrams, we find that the wedge defining AGN comprises most
sources with continuum-dominated spectra, but also contains many starbursts.
The comparison of the 11.3 micron PAH EW and the H-band effective radius,
measured from HST data, indicates that sources with EW>2 micron, are typically
more extended than ~3 kpc. However, there is no strong correlation between the
MIR spectral type and the near-IR extent of the sources. [Abridged].

93 GHz continuum emission and H70 alpha + H57 alpha radio recombination line

were missed in the previous 8 GHz observations due to a combination of
spatial-filtering, poor surface brightness sensitivity and primary beam
attenuation.
  We consider the implications that a significant number of these extended HII

free-free emission suggests a large number of regions have been mis-classified.
Rather than being very young objects prior to UCHII region formation, they are,
in fact, associated with extended HII regions and thus significantly older. In
addition, inadvertently ignoring a potentially substantial flux contribution
(up to ~0.5Jy) from free-free emission has implications for dust masses derived
from sub-mm flux densities. The large spatial scales probed by single-dish
telescopes, which do not suffer from spatial filtering, are particularly
susceptible and dust masses may be overestimated by up to a factor of ~2.

simple model developed in the context of Ras activation with competing negative

presence of slow diffusion, results in clustering of activated molecules on the
plasma membrane, and rapid spatial spreading as the front of the cluster
propagates with a constant velocity (dependent on the feedback strength). The
advancing fronts of the clusters of the activated species are rough, with
scaling consistent with the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation in one
dimension. Our minimal model is general enough to describe signal transduction
in a wide variety of biological networks where activity in the

usually assumed to be stable due to protons high inertia, but an analytical
analysis of the process is still lacking. The stability of a charge and current
neutralized proton beam passing through a plasma is therefore conducted here,
for typical proton driven Fast Ignition parameters. In the cold regime, two
fast growing Buneman-like modes are found, with an inverse growth-rate much
smaller than the beam time-of-flight to the target core. The stability issue is
thus not so obvious, and Kinetic effects are investigated. One unstable mode is
found stabilized by the background plasma protons and electrons temperatures.
The second mode is also damped, providing the proton beam thermal spread is

on the decoherence entropy and the entropy produced during the hydrodynamic
phase by viscous effects. We then present a general framework, based on the
Husimi distribution function, for the calculation of entropy growth in quantum

collision during which most of the entropy is generated. The entropy calculated
from the Husimi distribution exhibits linear growth when the quantum field
contains unstable modes and is asymptotically equal to the Kolmogorov-Sina\""i

modifications of the relic fluxes by about $20 \%$ and of the associated event
rates at the level of $10-20 \%$. Such an effect is important since it is of
the same order as the rate variation introduced when different oscillation
scenarios (i.e. hierarchy or $\theta_{13}$) are considered. In addition, due to
the shock wave, the rates become less sensitive to collective effects, in the
inverted hierarchy and when $\sin^2 2 \theta_{13}$ is between the Chooz limit
and $10^{-5}$. We propose a simplified model to account for shock wave effects
in future predictions.

outstanding star forming regions of the Local Group and a primary target to
study star formation in an environment of low metallicity. In order to obtain a
more complete picture of the not yet consumed or dispersed cool gas, we
searched for line emission from molecular clouds that could be associated with
molecular hydrogen emission detected in the region. We obtained a high
sensitivity 12CO J=2-1 map with the 15-m SEST telescope, complemented by
pointed observations of 13CO J=2-1 and CS J=2-1. We report the discovery of a
dense molecular cloud towards an embedded young massive star at ~ 20"" (~5 pc,
at the distance of 50 kpc) northwest of R136, the compact massive central
stellar cluster powering 30 Doradus in the LMC, that could be triggering star
formation in the surrounding molecular clouds. We derived a molecular mass of
$\lesssim 10^4$ \msol, a linear radius of 3 pc, as an upper limit, and a mean
density of $\gtrsim 10^{3}$ cm$^{-3}$ for the cloud. The detection of CS J=2-1
emission line indicates larger densities, $\sim 10^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$. The dense
molecular cloud is associated with molecular 2.12 um H2 emission. We suggest
that the observed molecular gas could be the remains of dense molecular
material surviving the action of strong UV fields and winds in which the young
massive star has formed.

analytically in Fourier space using the slowly varying envelope approximation.
Our analysis reveals the influence of the different medium response
coefficients on the propagation dynamics. Applying these results to a specific
example system, we show that chiral interactions already become important at
experimentally accessible parameter ranges in dilute vapors. The chirality
renders the propagation dynamics sensitive to the phase of the applied fields,
and we show that this phase-dependence enables one to control the pulse
evolution during its propagation through the medium. Our results demonstrate
that the magnetic field component of a probe beam can crucially influence the
system dynamics even if it couples to the medium only weakly.

discovered by visual inspection of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) as part

the SDSS g band due to unusually strong OIII 4959-5007 emission lines. We
present the results of the first targeted observations of the object in the
optical, UV and X-ray, which show that the object contains highly ionized gas.
Although the line ratios are similar to extended emission-line regions near
luminous AGN, the source of this ionization is not apparent. The emission-line
properties, and lack of x-ray emission from IC 2497, suggest either a highly
obscured AGN with a novel geometry arranged to allow photoionization of the
object but not the galaxy's own circumnuclear gas, or, as we argue, the first
detection of a quasar light echo. In this case, either the luminosity of the
central source has decreased dramatically or else the obscuration in the system
has increased within 10^5 years. This object may thus represent the first
direct probe of quasar history on these timescales.
