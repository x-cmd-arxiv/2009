Although most
of them are thought to be accelerated by supernova remnants, the details of the
acceleration process and its efficiency are not well determined. Here we show
that the pressure induced by cosmic rays exceeds the thermal pressure behind
the northeast shock of the supernova remnant RCW 86, where the X-ray emission
is dominated by synchrotron radiation from ultra-relativistic electrons. We
determined the cosmic-ray content from the thermal Doppler broadening measured
with optical spectroscopy, combined with a proper-motion study in X- rays. The
measured post-shock proton temperature in combination with the shock velocity
does not agree with standard shock heating, implying that >50% of the
post-shock pressure is produced by cosmic rays.

service-oriented paradigm, such as web-services, consists of clearly separating
the enforcement of authorization policies and the workflow of the applications,
so that the interplay between the policy level and the workflow level is
abstracted away. While such an approach is attractive because it is quite
simple and permits one to reason about crucial properties of the policies under
consideration, it does not provide the right level of abstraction to specify
and reason about the way the workflow may interfere with the policies, and vice
versa. For example, the creation of a certificate as a side effect of a
workflow operation may enable a policy rule to fire and grant access to a
certain resource; without executing the operation, the policy rule should
remain inactive. Similarly, policy queries may be used as guards for workflow
transitions.
  In this paper, we present a two-level formal verification framework to
overcome these problems and formally reason about the interplay of
authorization policies and workflow in service-oriented architectures. This
allows us to define and investigate some verification problems for SO

with models of X-ray irradiated disks and by searching for empirical
correlations between the line luminosities and stellar and circumstellar
parameters. We measure neon line fluxes and X-ray luminosities for 28 young
stellar objects in the Rho Ophiuchi star formation region for which good
quality infrared spectra and X-ray data have been obtained, the former with the
Spitzer IRS and the latter with the Deep Rho Ophiuchi XMM-Newton Observation.
  We detect the [Ne II] and the [Ne III] lines in 10 and 1 cases, respectively.
Line luminosities show no correlation with X-ray emission. The luminosity of
the [Ne II] line for one star, and that of both the [Ne II] and [Ne III] lines
for a second star, match the predictions of published models of X-ray
irradiated disks; for the remaining 8 objects the [Ne II] emission is 1-3 dex
higher than predicted on the basis of their L_X. Class I objects show
significantly stronger [Ne II] lines than Class II and Class III ones. A
correlation is moreover found between the [Ne II] line emission and the disk
mass accretion rates. This might point toward a role of accretion-generated UV
emission in the generation of the line or to other mechanisms related to mass
inflows from circumstellar disks and envelopes and/or to the associated mass
outflows (winds and jets). We conclude that the X-ray luminosity is not the
only parameter that determines the [Ne II] emission. Explaining the strong [Ne
II] emission of Class I objects likely requires the inclusion in the models of
additional physical components such as the envelope, inflows, and outflows.

nature, is a phenomenon whose effects are not just felt at energy scales
comparable to the non-commutativity scale. Loop effects can transmit signatures
of any underlying non-commutativity to macroscopic scales (a manifestation of a
phenomenon that has come to be known as UV/IR mode mixing) and offer a
potential lever to constrain the amount of non-commutativity present in nature,
if present at all. Field theories defined on non-commutative spaces (realized
in string theory when D-branes are coupled to backgrounds of non-trivial RR
background flux), can exhibit strong UV/IR mode mixing, manifesting in a
non-local one loop effective action. In the context of inflation in the
presence of any background non-commutativity, we demonstrate how this UV/IR
mixing at the loop level can allow us to place severe constraints on the scale
of non-commutativity if we presume inflation is responsible for large scale
structure. We demonstrate that any amount of non-commutativity greatly
suppresses the CMB power at all observable scales, {\it independent} of the
scale of inflation, and independent of whether or not the non-commutativity
tensor redshifts during inflation, therefore nullifying a very salient and
successful prediction of inflation.

this nucleus size and a water production rate of 3 x 10^28 molecules s-1 at

out to ~5 AU (Lowry et al. 2001, Snodgrass et al. 2008) support our finding of
a highly active nuclear surface. Compared to Deep Impact's first target, comet
9P/Tempel 1, Hartley 2's nucleus is one-fifth as wide (and about one-hundredth

about 13 times the active surface fraction. Unlike Tempel 1, it should be
highly susceptible to jet driven spin-up torques, and so could be rotating at a
much higher frequency. Barring a catastrophic breakup or major fragmentation
event, the comet should be able to survive up to another 100 apparitions (~700

  Approximate solutions are generated by a semi-discrete finite element scheme.
We first formulate sufficient conditions that guarantee convergence to a weak
solution. The convergence proof relies on weak compactness and convexity, and
it applies to the more general constitutive relations $\mu(\theta) = \bar \mu
\theta^\alpha$, $\kappa(\theta) = \bar \kappa \theta^\beta$, with $\alpha\geq
0$, $0 \leq \beta < 2$ ($\bar \mu, \bar \kappa$ constants). We then verify the
sufficient conditions in the case $\alpha=0$ and $0\leq\beta<{3/2}$. The data
are assumed to be without vacuum, mass concentrations, or vanishing
temperatures, and the same holds for the weak solutions.

describing tunneling process inside proton--nucleus radial barrier are taken
into account. Exact solutions for amplitudes of wave function, penetrability
$T$ and reflection $R$ are found for $n$-step barrier (at arbitrary $n$) which
approximates the realistic barrier. In contrast to semiclassical approach and
two-potential approach, we establish by this method essential dependence of the
penetrability on the starting point $R_{\rm form}$ in the internal well where
proton starts to move outside (for example, for $^{157}_{73}{\rm Ta}$ the
penetrability is changed up to 200 times; accuracy is $|T+R-1| < 1.5 \cdot
10^{-15}$). We impose a new condition: in the beginning of the proton decay the
proton starts to move outside from minimum of the well. Such a condition
provides minimal calculated half-life and gives stable basis for predictions.
However, the half-lives calculated by such an approach turn out to be a little
closer to experimental data in comparison with the semiclassical half-lives.
Estimated influence of the external barrier region is up to 1.5 times for
changed penetrability.

grayscale images by directly applying the Q-state Ising (or Potts) model. Since
the Potts model was first proposed in 1952, physicists have studied lattice
models to gain deep insights into magnetism and other disordered systems. For
some time, researchers have realized that digital images may be modeled in much
the same way as these physical systems (i.e., as a square lattice of numerical
values). A major drawback in using Potts model methods for image segmentation
is that, with conventional methods, it processes in exponential time. Advances
have been made via certain approximations to reduce the segmentation process to
power-law time. However, in many applications (such as for sonar imagery),
real-time processing requires much greater efficiency. This article contains a
description of an energy minimization technique that applies four Potts
(Q-Ising) models directly to the image and processes in linear time. The result
is analogous to partitioning the system into regions of four classes of
magnetism. This direct Potts segmentation technique is demonstrated on
photographic, medical, and acoustic images.

us closer towards a better understanding of the physics of the solar magnetic

and turbulent flux pumping confuse the relative roles of these vis-a-vis
magnetic flux transport. I argue that unless some of these issues are
addressed, no model of the solar cycle can claim to be ``the standard model'',

flattening of the galaxy rotation curves as an effect of the non-(covariant)
conservation of the energy-momentum tensor of visible matter. Afterwards, one
assumes instead that this non-minimal coupling modifies the scalar curvature in
a way that can be interpreted as a dark matter component (albeit with negative
pressure). It is concluded that it is possible to mimic known dark matter
density profiles through an appropriate power-law coupling $f_2 = (R/R0)^n$,
with a negative index $n$ -- a fact that reflects the dominance of dark matter
at large distances. The properties of the model are extensively discussed, and

Previously published data, reprocessed with an updated version of the
calibration pipeline, are included along with new observations. The recent
upward revision of the white dwarf's effective temperature to 200,000 K has
motivated us to re-analyze all the data. We compare observations with
photoionization models and find that the density of the O VI nebula is about 10
cm^-3, and that the stellar flux must be attenuated by about 90% by the time it
impinges on the inner face of the nebula. We infer that this attenuation is due
to circumstellar material ejected by KPD 0005+5106 earlier in its evolution.

agreement exist the security of which can be proven under the assumption that
quantum or relativity theory is correct. More precisely, this is based on the
non-local behavior of certain quantum systems, combined with the non-signaling
postulate from relativity. An advantage is that the resulting security is
independent of what (quantum) systems the legitimate parties' devices operate
on: they do not have to be trusted. Unfortunately, the protocol proposed by
Barrett et al. cannot tolerate any errors caused by noise in the quantum
channel. Furthermore, even in the error-free case it is inefficient: its
communication complexity is Theta(1/epsilon) when forcing the attacker's
information below epsilon, even if only a single key bit is generated.
Potentially, the problem can be solved by privacy amplification of relativistic
- or non-signaling - secrecy. We show, however, that such privacy amplification
is impossible with respect to the most important form of non-local behavior,
and application of arbitrary hash functions.

  Conference on Intelligent Agent Technology. 2009",,,,"cs.GT cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose a bid optimizer for sponsored keyword search
auctions which leads to better retention of advertisers by yielding attractive
utilities to the advertisers without decreasing the revenue to the search
engine. The bid optimizer is positioned as a key value added tool the search
engine provides to the advertisers. The proposed bid optimizer algorithm
transforms the reported values of the advertisers for a keyword into a
correlated bid profile using many ideas from cooperative game theory. The
algorithm is based on a characteristic form game involving the search engine
and the advertisers. Ideas from Nash bargaining theory are used in formulating
the characteristic form game to provide for a fair share of surplus among the
players involved. The algorithm then computes the nucleolus of the
characteristic form game since we find that the nucleolus is an apt way of
allocating the gains of cooperation among the search engine and the
advertisers. The algorithm next transforms the nucleolus into a correlated bid
profile using a linear programming formulation. This bid profile is input to a
standard generalized second price mechanism (GSP) for determining the
allocation of sponsored slots and the prices to be be paid by the winners. The
correlated bid profile that we determine is a locally envy-free equilibrium and
also a correlated equilibrium of the underlying game. Through detailed
simulation experiments, we show that the proposed bid optimizer retains more
customers than a plain GSP mechanism and also yields better long-run utilities
to the search engine and the advertisers.

physics. We argue there is a very well motivated theoretical preexisting
framework consistent with dark matter annihilation being observed by the PAMELA
satellite detector. The dark matter is (mainly) the neutral W boson
superpartner, the wino with mass below 200 GeV. Using the program GALPROP we
study the annihilation products and backgrounds together. Antimatter and gammas
from annihilating winos contribute below this energy. We explain why PAMELA
data does not imply no antiproton signal was observed by PAMELA or earlier
experiments, and explain why the antiproton analysis was misunderstood by
earlier papers. Wino annihilation does not describe the Fermi e+ + e- data
(except partially below ~ 100 GeV). At higher energies we expect astrophysical
mechanisms, and we simply parameterize them so the combination can describe all
the data. We emphasize several predictions for satellite data to test the wino
interpretation, particularly the turndown of the positron and antiproton
spectra above 100 GeV. Most other interpretations require a large rise in the
positron rates above 100 GeV. We focus on studying this well-motivated and long
predicted wino interpretation, rather than comparisons with other
interpretations. We emphasize that interpretations also depend very strongly on
assumptions about the cosmological history of the universe, and on propagation
of antiprotons and positrons in the galaxy. The winos PAMELA is observing arose
from some non-thermal sources such as moduli decay rather than a universe that
cooled in thermal equilibrium after the big bang. Then it is appropriate to
normalize the wino density to the local relic density, and no ""boost factors""
are needed to obtain the reported PAMELA rates.

procedure to derive anomaly-free models is presented which first implements
anomaly-freedom in spherical symmetry and then the LTB conditions rather than
the other way around. While the two methods give slightly different equations
of motion, not altogether surprisingly given the ubiquitous sprawl of
quantization ambiguities, final conclusions remain unchanged: Compared to
quantizations of homogeneous models, bounces seem to appear less easily in
inhomogeneous situations, and even the existence of homogeneous solutions as
special cases in inhomogeneous models may be precluded by quantum effects.
However, compared to marginal models, bouncing solutions seem more likely with
non-marginal models.

spectra are the physical, measurable quantities. These findings cast some doubt
on the validity of the adiabatic subtraction at horizon exit, $v=1$, to

halos with virial temperatures just above T_vir >~ 10^4 K cools by collisional
excitation of atomic H. Although it cools efficiently, this gas remains
relatively hot, at a temperature near T ~ 8000 K, and consequently might be
able to avoid fragmentation and collapse directly into a supermassive black
hole (SMBH). In order for H_2--formation and cooling to be strongly suppressed,
the gas must be irradiated by a sufficiently intense ultraviolet (UV) flux. We
performed a suite of three--dimensional hydrodynamical adaptive mesh refinement
(AMR) simulations of gas collapse in three different protogalactic halos with
T_vir >~ 10^4 K, irradiated by a UV flux with various intensities and spectra.
We determined the critical specific intensity, Jcrit, required to suppress H_2
cooling in each of the three halos. For a hard spectrum representative of
metal--free stars, we find (in units of 10^{-21} erg s^{-1} Hz^{-1} sr^{-1}
cm^{-2}) 10^4<Jcrit<10^5, while for a softer spectrum, which is characteristic
of a normal stellar population, and for which H^{-} --dissociation is
important, we find 30<Jcrit<300. These values are a factor of 3--10 lower than
previous estimates. We attribute the difference to the higher, more accurate
H_2 collisional dissociation rate we adopted. The reduction in Jcrit
exponentially increases the number of rare halos exposed to super--critical
radiation. When H_2 cooling is suppressed, gas collapse starts with a delay,
but it ultimately proceeds more rapidly. The infall velocity is near the
increased sound speed, and an object as massive as M ~ 10^5 solar mass may form
at the center of these halos, compared to the M ~ 10^2 solar mass stars forming
when H_2--cooling is efficient.

intractability of the partition function and its derivatives. Here we propose a
new parameter estimation technique that does not require computing an
intractable normalization factor or sampling from the equilibrium distribution
of the model. This is achieved by establishing dynamics that would transform
the observed data distribution into the model distribution, and then setting as
the objective the minimization of the KL divergence between the data
distribution and the distribution produced by running the dynamics for an
infinitesimal time. Score matching, minimum velocity learning, and certain
forms of contrastive divergence are shown to be special cases of this learning
technique. We demonstrate parameter estimation in Ising models, deep belief
networks and an independent component analysis model of natural scenes. In the
Ising model case, current state of the art techniques are outperformed by at
least an order of magnitude in learning time, with lower error in recovered
coupling parameters.

generally possess much greater decay rates than the former, owing to several

dramatic enough for the BES-III experiment to establish these events.

dark matter (DM) halos in N-body simulations to understand the processes that
drive the evolution of shapes of DM halos and elliptical galaxies in which
central masses are grown. A longstanding issue is whether the change in the
shapes of DM halos is the result of chaotic scattering of box orbits, or
whether they change shape adiabatically in response to the evolving galactic
potential. We use orbital frequencies to classify orbits, to quantify orbital
shapes, and to identify resonant orbits and chaotic orbits. The frequency-based
method overcomes the limitations of Lyapunov exponents which are sensitive to
numerical discreteness effects. Regardless of the distribution of the baryonic
component, the shape of a DM halo changes primarily due to changes in the
shapes of individual orbits within a given family. Orbits with small
pericentric radii are more likely to change both their orbital type and shape
than orbits with large pericentric radii. Whether the evolution is regular (and
reversible) or chaotic (and irreversible), depends primarily on the radial
distribution of the baryonic component. The growth of an extended baryonic
component of any shape results in a regular rather than chaotic change in
orbital populations. In contrast the growth of a massive and compact central
component results in chaotic scattering of a significant fraction of both box
and long-axis tube orbits. The growth of a disk causes a significant fraction
of halo particles to become trapped by major global orbital resonances. Despite
the fact that shape of a DM halo is always quite oblate following the growth of
a central baryonic component, a significant fraction of its orbit population
has characteristics of its triaxial or prolate progenitor (ABRIDGED).

emission. This is the first spatially-extended Lya+HeII emitter observed and
the lowest redshift Lya blob yet found. Strong Lya and HeII-1640 emission in
the absence of metal lines has been proposed as a unique observational
signature of primordial galaxy formation (e.g., from gravitational cooling
radiation or Population III star formation), but no convincing examples of
spatially-extended Lya+HeII emitters have surfaced either in Lya-emitting
galaxy surveys at high redshifts (z > 4) or in studies of Lya nebulae at lower
redshifts. From comparisons with photoionization models, we find that the
observed line ratios in this nebula are consistent with low metallicity gas (Z
< 10^-2 - 10^-3 Z_sun), but that this conclusion depends on the unknown
ionization parameter of the system. The large HeII equivalent width (~37+/-10A)
and the large HeII/Lya ratio (0.12+/-0.04) suggest that the cloud is being
illuminated by a hard ionizing continuum, either an AGN or very low metallicity
stars, or perhaps powered by gravitational cooling radiation. Thus far there is
no obvious sign of a powerful AGN in or near the system, so in order to power
the nebula while remaining hidden from view even in the mid-infrared, the AGN
would need to be heavily obscured. Despite the strong Lya+HeII emission, it is
not yet clear what is the dominant power source for this nebula. The system
therefore serves as an instructive example of how the complexities of true
astrophysical sources will complicate matters when attempting to use a strong
Lya+HeII signature as a unique tracer of primordial galaxy formation.

challenge for theoretical models of galaxy formation and evolution. Using one
of the deepest large public near-IR surveys to date, we investigate in detail
the correlations between star formation and galaxy structural parameters (size,
stellar mass, and surface density) from z=2 to the present. At all redshifts,
massive quiescent galaxies (i.e. those with little or no star formation) occupy
the extreme high end of the surface density distribution and follow a tight
mass-size correlation, while star-forming galaxies show a broad range of both
densities and sizes. Conversely, galaxies with the highest surface densities
comprise a nearly-homogeneous population with little or no ongoing star
formation, while less dense galaxies exhibit high star-formation rates and
varying levels of dust obscuration. Both the sizes and surface densities of
quiescent galaxies evolve strongly from z=2-0; we parameterize this evolution
for both populations with simple power law functions and present best-fit
parameters for comparison to future theoretical models. Higher-mass quiescent
galaxies undergo faster structural evolution, consistent with previous results.
Interestingly, star-forming galaxies' sizes and densities evolve at rates
similar to those of quiescent galaxies. It is therefore possible that the same
physical processes drive the structural evolution of both populations,
suggesting that ""dry mergers"" may not be the sole culprit in this size
evolution.

for Betelgeuse, corresponding to 5 resolution elements over its stellar disk.
The AMBER data in the continuum can be reasonably fitted by a uniform disk with
a diameter of 43.19+/-0.03 mas or a limb-darkening disk with 43.56+/-0.06 mas.
The K-band interferometric data taken at various epochs suggest that Betelgeuse
seen in the continuum shows much smaller deviations from the above
uniform/limb-darkened disk than predicted by 3-D convection simulations. On the
other hand, our AMBER data in the CO lines reveal that the blue and red wings
of the CO lines originate in spatially distinct regions over the stellar disk,
indicating an inhomogeneous velocity field. Our AMBER data in the CO lines can
be roughly explained by a simple model, in which a patch of CO gas is moving
outward or inward at velocities of 10--15 km s^-1, while the CO gas in the
remaining region in the atmosphere is moving in the opposite direction at the
same velocities. The AMBER data are also consistent with the presence of warm
molecular layers at ~1.4--1.5 Rstar with a CO column density of ~1 x 10^20
cm^-2. Our AMBER observations of Betelgeuse are the first spatially resolved

system whose orbits are strongly chaotic. These objects typically suffer
significant changes of orbital parameters on timescales of a few thousand
years, and their orbital evolution exhibits two types of behaviors described
qualitatively as random-walk and resonance-sticking. We have analyzed the
chaotic behavior of the known Centaurs. Our analysis has revealed that the two
types of chaotic evolution are quantitatively distinguishable: (1) the random
walk-type behavior is well described by so-called generalized diffusion in
which the rms deviation of the semimajor axis grows with time t as ~t^H, with
Hurst exponent H in the range 0.22--0.95, however (2) orbital evolution
dominated by intermittent resonance sticking, with sudden jumps from one mean
motion resonance to another, has poorly defined H. We further find that these
two types of behavior are correlated with Centaur dynamical lifetime: most
Centaurs whose dynamical lifetime is less than ~22 Myr exhibit generalized
diffusion, whereas most Centaurs of longer dynamical lifetimes exhibit
intermittent resonance sticking. We also find that Centaurs in the diffusing
class are likely to evolve into Jupiter-family comets during their dynamical
lifetimes, while those in the resonance-hopping class do not.

considerable observational evidence that winds of massive stars are clumpy.
Individual clumps may interact with the jets in high-mass microquasars to
produce outbursts of high-energy emission. Gamma-ray flares have been detected
in some high-mass X-ray binaries, such as Cygnus X-1, and probably in LS 5039

interaction between a jet and a clump of the stellar wind in a high-mass
microquasar. Assuming a hydrodynamic scenario for the jet-clump interaction, we
calculate the spectral energy distributions produced by the dominant
non-thermal processes: relativistic bremsstrahlung, synchrotron and inverse
Compton radiation, for leptons, and for hadrons, proton-proton collisions.
Significant levels of emission in X-rays (synchrotron), high-energy gamma rays
(inverse Compton), and very high-energy gamma rays (from the decay of neutral
pions) are predicted, with luminosities in the different domains in the range ~
10^{32}-10^{35} erg/s. The spectral energy distributions vary strongly
depending on the specific conditions. Jet-clump interactions may be detectable
at high and very high energies, and provide an explanation for the fast TeV

confirm that the giants have undergone the first dredge-up and that material
processed by the CN cycle has been mixed to the surface layers. The observed
abundances are compared to predictions of a standard stellar model based on the
Clemson-American University of Beirut (CAUB) stellar evolution code. The model
reproduces the observed evolution of the N and O abundances, as well as the
previously derived 12C/13C ratio, but it fails to predict by a factor of 1.5
the observed level of 12C depletion. Li abundances are derived to determine if
non-canonical extra mixing has occurred in the Hyades giants. The Li abundance
of the giant gamma Tau is in good accord with the predicted level of surface Li
dilution, but a ~0.35 dex spread in the giant Li abundances is found and cannot
be explained by the stellar model. Possible sources of the spread are
discussed; however, it is apparent that the differential mechanism responsible
for the Li dispersion must be unrelated to the uniformly low 12C abundances of
the giants. Na, Mg, and Al abundances are derived as an additional test of our
stellar model. All three elements are found to be overabundant by 0.2-0.5 dex
in the giants relative to the dwarfs. Such large enhancements of these elements
are not predicted by the stellar model, and non-LTE effects significantly
larger (and, in some cases, of opposite sign) than those implied by extant

lasers based on photonic crystals, micro-disks, metal clad cavities and
nanowires can now reach the diffraction limit, which restricts both the optical
mode size and physical device dimension to be larger than half a wavelength.
While surface plasmons are capable of tightly localizing light, ohmic loss at
optical frequencies has inhibited the realization of truly nano-scale lasers.
Recent theory has proposed a way to significantly reduce plasmonic loss while
maintaining ultra-small modes by using a hybrid plasmonic waveguide. Using this
approach, we report an experimental demonstration of nano-scale plasmonic
lasers producing optical modes 100 times smaller than the diffraction limit,
utilizing a high gain Cadmium Sulphide semiconductor nanowire atop a Silver
surface separated by a 5 nm thick insulating gap. Direct measurements of
emission lifetime reveal a broad-band enhancement of the nanowire's spontaneous
emission rate by up to 6 times due to the strong mode confinement and the
signature of apparently threshold-less lasing. Since plasmonic modes have no
cut-off, we show down-scaling of the lateral dimensions of both device and
optical mode. As these optical coherent sources approach molecular and
electronics length scales, plasmonic lasers offer the possibility to explore
extreme interactions between light and matter, opening new avenues in active

However, the modified-Poisson formulation, on which I concentrate, uniquely
predicts a subtle anomaly that may be detected in planetary and spacecraft
motions (and perhaps in other precision systems, such as binary pulsars),
despite their very high accelerations, and even if the MOND interpolating
function is arbitrarily close to unity at high accelerations. Near the sun,
this anomaly appears as a quadrupole field, with the acceleration at position u
from the sun being g_i(u)=-q_{ij}u^j, with q_{ij} diagonal, axisymmetric, and
traceless: -2q_{xx}=-2q_{yy}=q_{zz}=q(eta)*(a0/R_M), where
R_M=(MG/a0)^{1/2}=8*10^3 au is the MOND radius of the sun. The anomaly is
described and analyzed as the Newtonian field of the fictitious cloud of
``phantom matter'' that hovers around the sun. I find, for the relevant range
of eta values, and for a range of interpolating functions, mu(x), values of
10^{-2}<-q< 0.3, which turn out to be sensitive to the form of mu(x) around the
MOND-to-Newtonian transition. This range verges on the present bounds from
solar system measurements. There might thus exist favorable prospects for
either measuring the effect, or constraining the theory and the relevant

the intermediate statistics obeyed by magnons, the quantized spin waves, and
then construct a corresponding intermediate-statistics realization for the
angular momentum algebra in terms of the creation and annihilation operators of
the magnons. In other words, instead of the Holstein-Primakoff representation,
a bosonic representation subject to a constraint on the occupation number, we
present an intermediate-statistics representation with no constraints. In this
realization, the maximum occupation number is naturally embodied in the
commutation relation of creation and annihilation operators, while the
Holstein-Primakoff representation is a bosonic operator relation with an
additional putting-in-by-hand restriction on the occupation number. We deduce
the intermediate-statistics distribution function for magnons. On the basis of
these results, we calculate the dispersion relations for ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic spin waves. The relations between the intermediate statistics
that magnons obey and the other two important kinds of intermediate statistics,
Haldane-Wu statistics and the fractional statistics of anyons, are discussed.
We also compare the spectrum of the intermediate-statistics spin wave with the
exact solution of the one-dimensional s = 1/2 Heisenberg model, which is
obtained by the Bethe ansatz method. For ferromagnets, we take the
contributions from the interaction between magnons (the quartic contribution),
the next-to-nearest neighbor interaction, and the dipolar interaction into
account for comparison with the experiment.

of these PNe. The eight non-detections are angularly large PNe with very low
H-alpha surface brightnesses. We find three types of correspondence between the
24 um emission and H-alpha line emission of these PNe: six show 24 um emission
more extended than H-alpha emission, nine have a similar extent at 24 um and
H-alpha, and 13 show diffuse 24 um emission near the center of the H-alpha
shell. The sizes and surface brightnesses of these three groups of PNe and the
non-detections suggest an evolutionary sequence, with the youngest ones being
brightest and the most evolved ones undetected. The 24 um band emission from
these PNe is attributed to [O IV] 25.9 um and [Ne V] 24.3 um line emission and
dust continuum emission, but the relative contributions of these three
components depend on the temperature of the central star and the distribution
of gas and dust in the nebula.

profiles, as well as stellar metallicity distributions along its disk. We show
that, when expressed in terms of the corresponding disk scale lengths, the
observed radial profiles of MW and M31 exhibit interesting similarities,
suggesting the possibility of a description within a common framework. We find
that the profiles of stars, gas fraction and metallicity of the two galaxies,
as well as most of their global properties, are well described by our model,
provided the star formation efficiency in M31 disk is twice as large as in the
MW. We show that the star formation rate profile of M31 cannot be fitted with
any form of the Kennicutt-Schmidt law (KS Law) for star formation. We attribute
those discrepancies to the fact that M31 has undergone a more active star
formation history, even in the recent past, as suggested by observations of a
""head-on"" collision with the neighboring M32 galaxy about 200 Myr ago. The MW
has most probably undergone a quiescent secular evolution, making possible a
fairly successful description with a simple model. If M31 is more typical of
spiral galaxies, as recently suggested by Hammer et al. (2007), more complex
models, involving galaxy interactions, will be required for the description of
spirals.

improving the physical layer security of wireless transmission, in terms of

answer the question of ""how to achieve those gains in a practical decentralized

exchange?"". For this purpose, we model the physical layer security cooperation
problem as a coalitional game with non-transferable utility and propose a
distributed algorithm for coalition formation. Through the proposed algorithm,
the wireless users can autonomously cooperate and self-organize into disjoint
independent coalitions, while maximizing their secrecy capacity taking into
account the security costs during information exchange. We analyze the
resulting coalitional structures, discuss their properties, and study how the
users can self-adapt the network topology to environmental changes such as
mobility. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm allows the users
to cooperate and self-organize while improving the average secrecy capacity per

star formation across the galaxy. The FUV and NUV flux measurements of the SF
regions, combined with ground-based data for estimating the reddening by
interstellar dust from the massive stars they contain, are used to derive their
ages and masses. The GALEX imaging, combining deep sensitivity and coverage of
the entire galaxy, provides a complete picture of the recent star formation in
M31 and its variation with environment throughout the galaxy. The FUV and NUV
measurements are sensitive to detect stellar populations younger than a few
hundred Myrs. We detected 894 SF regions, with size > 1600 pc^{2} above an
average FUV flux limit of ~ 26 ABmag arcsecond^{-2}, over the whole 26 kpc

The star formation rate (SFR) from the youngest UV sources (age < 10 Myr) is
comparable to that derived from H_{alpha}, as expected. We show the dependence
of the results on the assumed metallicity. When star formation detected from IR
measurements of the heated dust is added to the UV-measured star formation

the quadrupole harmonics in the expansion of the vector field of the proper

directly from the VLBI group delays without intermediate calculation of the
individual proper motion. The estimates have been obtained separately for
different red shift zones. It was shown that the dipole harmonic does not vary
significantly, whereas the amplitude of the quadrupole gradually increases with
the red shift. This quadrupole pattern can be interpreted either as an
anisotropic Hubble expansion, or as an indication of the primordial
gravitational waves in the early Universe. However, more prosaic explanations

bundle. The string class is the obstruction to lifting a bundle whose structure
group is the loop group $LG$ to one whose structure group is the Kac-Moody
central extension of the loop group.
  We develop a notion of higher string classes for bundles whose structure
group is the group of based loops, $\Omega G$. In particular, we give a formula
for characteristic classes in odd dimensions for such bundles which are
associated to characteristic classes for $G$-bundles in the same way that the
string class is related to the first Pontrjagyn class of a certain $G$-bundle
associated to the loop group bundle in question. This provides us with a theory
of characteristic classes for $\Omega G$-bundles analogous to Chern-Weil theory
in finite dimensions. This also gives us a geometric interpretation of the
well-known transgression map $H^{2k}(BG) \to H^{2k-1}(G).$
  We also consider the obstruction to lifting a bundle whose structure group is
not the loop group but the semi-direct product of the loop group with the
circle, $LG \rtimes S^1$. We review the theory of bundle gerbes and their
application to central extensions and lifting problems and use these methods to
obtain an explicit expression for the de Rham representative of the obstruction
to lifting such a bundle. We also relate this to a generalisation of the
so-called `caloron correspondence' (which relates $LG$-bundles over $M$ to
$G$-bundles over $M \times S^1$) to a correspondence which relates $LG \rtimes
S^1$-bundles over $M$ to $G$-bundles over $S^1$-bundles over $M$.

Finally, we discuss the relevance of these noise sources in the detection of
gravitational waves by comparing the estimated spectral densities of Newtonian
atmospheric noises considered here to the expected sensitivity curve of the

$A$ and $B$ sublattices of graphene are out of phase by $\pi$ implying that the
averaged LDOS, as one moves away from the impurity, shows no trace of the
$2q_F$ (with $q_F$ the Fermi momentum) Friedel modulation. This means that a
STM experiment lacking atomic resolution at the sublattice level will not be
able of detecting the presence of the Friedel oscillations [this seems to be
the case in the experiments reported in Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 101}, 206802
(2008)]. The momentum maps of the LDOS for different types of impurities are
given. In the case of the vacancy, $2q_F$ features are seen in these maps. In
all momentum space maps, $K$ and $K+K^\prime$ features are seen. The
$K+K^\prime$ features are different from what is seen around zero momentum. An
interpretation for these features is given. The calculations reported here are
valid for chemical substitution impurities, such as boron and nitrogen atoms,
as well as for vacancies. It is shown that the density of states close to the
impurity is very sensitive to type of disorder: diagonal, non-diagonal, or
vacancies. In the case of weakly coupled (to the carbon atoms) impurities, the
local density of states presents strong resonances at finite energies, which
leads to steps in the scanning tunneling currents and to suppression of the
Fano factor.

detailed description of our improved variational state and explain how the
physics of the Anderson-Mott transition can be inferred from equal-time
correlations functions, which can be easily computed within the variational
Monte Carlo scheme. The ground-state phase diagram is worked out in both the
paramagnetic and the magnetic sector. Whereas in the former a direct
second-order Anderson-Mott transition is obtained, when magnetism is allowed
variationally, we find evidence for the formation of local magnetic moments
that order before the Mott transition. Although the localization length
increases before the Mott transition, we have no evidence for the stabilization
of a true metallic phase. The effect of a frustrating next-nearest-neighbor
hopping $t^\prime$ is also studied in some detail. In particular, we show that
$t^\prime$ has two primary effects. The first one is the narrowing of the
stability region of the magnetic Anderson insulator, also leading to a
first-order magnetic transition. The second and most important effect of a
frustrating hopping term is the development of a ``glassy'' phase at strong
couplings, where many paramagnetic states, with disordered local moments, may
be stabilized.

explained by a strong partial covering absorber or by X-ray reflection onto the

between both scenarios. The interband cross-correlation functions indicate a
possible reprocessing of the X-rays into the longer wavelengths, consistent
with the idea of a thin accretion disk, powering the quasar. The time lags
between the X-ray and the optical/UV light curves, ranging from ~2 to ~18 days

deceleration/acceleration transition phase of dark energy models. As results,
we find that GRBs, calibrated by SNeIa, could be, at least, good distance
indicators capable of discriminating cosmological models with respect to
$\Lambda$CDM at high redshift. Besides, GRBs+SNeIa combined redshift-distance
diagram puts better in evidence the change of slope around redshift $z\sim 0.5$
which is usually addressed as the ""signature"" of today observed acceleration.
This feature could be interpreted, in more standard way, by the red sequence in
galaxy clusters.

other computing paradigm before, SOC is destined to exert a lasting influence
on the business domain, among others (e-commerce, e-government, e-business,
e-learning, e-health, etc.).
  The Young Researchers workshop series on Service-Oriented Computing is meant
to be a platform for junior researchers from industry and academics alike. Its
core objectives are to exchange information regarding advancements in the state
of the art and practice of SOC, as well as to identify emerging research topics
and the future trends in this domain.
  Following the success of the previous three workshops, the 4th European Young
Researchers Workshop on Service-Oriented Computing (YR-SOC 2009) introduced two
novelties: it was organised outside of the UK and it saw the introduction of a
number of tutorials, thus making the workshop a 3-day event. YR-SOC 2009 took
place at the CNR Institute of Information Science and Technologies in Pisa,
Italy, and was organised by Maurice ter Beek, Barry Norton, Stephan
Reiff-Marganiec and Monika Solanki.
  The contributions in this volume cover aspects such as automated service
composition, context-aware SOC, service-oriented programming, QoS-aware SOC,
service-oriented architectures, SOC modelling and analysis, process management,
web services, ontologies and the semantic web.

semiconductor substrates by metal adsorption. Significant progress concerning
study of their 1D character has been achieved recently by condensing noble
metal atoms on the Ge(001) surface. In particular, Pt and Au yield high quality
reconstructions with low defect densities. We reported on the self-organized
growth and the long-range order achieved, and present data from scanning
tunneling microscopy (STM) on the structural components. For Pt/Ge(001), we
find hot substrate growth is the preferred method for self-organization.
Despite various dimerized bonds, these atomic wires exhibit metallic conduction
at room temperature, as documented by low-bias STM. For the recently discovered
Au/Ge(001) nanowires, we have developed a deposition technique that allows
complete substrate coverage. The Au nanowires are extremely well separated
spatially, exhibit a continuous 1D charge density, and are of solid metallic
conductance. In this review we present structural details for both types of
nanowires, and discuss similarities and differences. A perspective is given for
their potential to host a one-dimensional electron system. The ability to
condense different noble metal nanowires demonstrates how atomic control of the
structure affects the electronic properties.

dynamics} for energies close to the energy of such equilibria; entrance and
exit from certain regions of the phase space is only possible via narrow
\emph{bottlenecks} created by the influence of the equilibrium points. In this
paper we provide a thorough pedagogical description of the phase space
structures that are responsible for controlling transport in these problems. Of
central importance is the existence of a \emph{Normally Hyperbolic Invariant
Manifold (NHIM)}, whose \emph{stable and unstable manifolds} have sufficient
dimensionality to act as separatrices, partitioning energy surfaces into
regions of qualitatively distinct behavior. This NHIM forms the natural
(dynamical) equator of a (spherical) \emph{dividing surface} which locally
divides an energy surface into two components (`reactants' and `products'), one
on either side of the bottleneck. This dividing surface has all the desired
properties sought for in \emph{transition state theory} where reaction rates
are computed from the flux through a dividing surface. In fact, the dividing
surface that we construct is crossed exactly once by reactive trajectories, and
not crossed by nonreactive trajectories, and related to these properties,
minimizes the flux upon variation of the dividing surface.
  We discuss three presentations of the energy surface and the phase space
structures contained in it for 2-degree-of-freedom (DoF) systems in the
threedimensional space $\R^3$, and two schematic models which capture many of
the essential features of the dynamics for $n$-DoF systems. In addition, we
elucidate the structure of the NHIM.

Kirillov's Orbit Method for the case of compact connected Lie groups. The
theory of Kirillov aims at finding all irreducible unitary representations of a
given Lie group $G$.
  The first chapter is intended to recall some facts about Lie groups. The most
important result is that for a functional $\lambda$ on the Lie algebra
$\mathfrak t$ of a maximal torus in a compact connected Lie group the
stabilizer is of the form $C(T_1)$ for a smaller torus $T_1$. This allows us to
define a complex structure on the coadjoint orbit $\mathcal O_\lambda =
G/C(T_1)$. In the second chapter we present the Borel-Weil Theorem which tells
us that all irreducible unitary representations of a compact connected Lie
group can be realized in the space of holomorphic sections of the bundle
$G\times_\tau\mathbb C$, where $\tau$ is a character of a maximal torus.
Finally, in the third chapter we show that coadjoint orbits are symplectic
manifolds for which prequantization yields a complex line bundle. Then we
investigate for which classes of coadjoint orbits one obtains representations
in the space of polarized sections of the prequantum bundle. This will lead us
back to the result of Borel-Weil.

have been detected from compact regions around PSR B1706-44 or within the

excess was located at the same position, 0.13 deg. to the southeast of the Vela

effect of the acceptance distribution in the field of view of the 3.8 m
telescope, which rapidly decreases toward the edge of the field of the camera,
on the detected gamma-ray morphology. The expected excess distribution for the
3.8 m telescope has been obtained by reweighting the distribution of HESS
J0835-455 measured by H.E.S.S. with the acceptance of the 3.8 m telescope. The
result is morphologically comparable to the CANGAROO excess distribution,
although the profile of the acceptance-reweighted H.E.S.S. distribution is more
diffuse than that of CANGAROO. The integral gamma-ray flux from HESS J0835-455

of a certain orbit of a point $x$ in a symmetric space under a projection onto
a maximal flat is the convex hull of the Weyl group orbit of $x$. We obtain the

apply a one-zone model for a star-gas system coupled by mass and energy
transfer. Additionally, we extend the network for active dynamical evolution.
This allows for a coupling between the dynamical state of the galaxy and its
internal properties. While the influence of the dynamics on the total star
formation rate is strong, the coupling of the internal properties (gas
temperature) on the dynamics is rather limited, because radiative cooling keeps
the gas temperature well below the virial temperature. Because of short cooling
and feedback timescales, the star formation rate is close to the equilibrium
star formation rates. Quasi-periodic starbursts occur, because star formation
follows the variations in the gas density induced by decaying virial
oscillations. This behaviour is quite insensitive to the nature and the details
of the stellar birth description, viz. whether spontaneous or induced star
formation is considered or the IMF is varied. A second type of burst is found
as an instability operating when the cooling may drop at very low densities
with increasing temperature. Bursts of star formation occur during transitory
phases, when dynamical equilibrium is established. Then they are quasi-periodic
on the dynamical timescale. Because of short heating and cooling timescales,
the star formation rate follows the equilibrium star formation rate
corresponding to the actual gas density.

service (QoS) in distributed multimedia systems. The existing solutions for the
problem of network congestion ignore scalability considerations because they
maintain a separate classification for each video stream. In this paper, we
propose a new method allowing to control QoS provided to clients according to
the network congestion, by discarding some frames when needed. The technique
proposed, called (m,k)-frame, is scalable with little degradation in
application performances. (m,k)-frame method is issued from the notion of
(m,k)-firm realtime constraints which means that among k invocations of a task,
m invocations must meet their deadline. Our simulation studies show the
usefulness of (m,k)-frame method to adapt the QoS to the real conditions in a
multimedia application, according to the current system load. Notably, the
system must adjust the QoS provided to active clients1 when their number
varies, i.e. dynamic arrival of clients.

edge of a bubble blown by an extraplanar supernova. One pointing direction is
near the brightest part of the arc, one is toward the interior of the
hypothesized bubble, and one is toward the bubble exterior. We fit spectral
models generated from 1-D hydrodynamical simulations of extraplanar supernova
remnants (SNRs) to the spectra. The spectra and the size of the arc
($\mathrm{radius} \approx 5\degr$) are reasonably well explained by a model in
which the arc is the bright edge of a $\sim$100,000-yr old SNR located
$\sim$1--2 kpc above the disk. The agreement between the model and the
observations can be improved if the metallicity of the X-ray--emitting gas is
$\sim$1/3 solar, which is plausible, as the dust which sequesters some metals
is unlikely to have been destroyed in the lifetime of the SNR. The width of the
arc is larger than that predicted by our SNR model; this discrepancy is also
seen with the Vela SNR, and may be due to the 1-D nature of our simulations. If
the arc is indeed the edge of an extraplanar SNR, this work supports the idea
that extraplanar supernovae contribute to the heating of the
$\sim$million-degree gas in the halo.

populated by vector fields, given the interesting possibility of generating
some level of statistical anisotropy in the cosmological perturbations. The
scenario we propose is strongly motivated by the fact that, for non-Abelian

the cosmological correlation functions, which are naturally absent in the
Abelian case. We compute these extra contributions to the bispectrum of the
curvature perturbation, using the delta N formula and the Schwinger-Keldysh
formalism. The primordial violation of rotational invariance (due to the
introduction of the SU(2) gauge multiplet) leaves its imprint on the
correlation functions introducing, as expected, some degree of statistical
anisotropy in our results. We calculate the non-Gaussianity parameter f_{NL},
proving that the new contributions derived from gauge bosons self-interactions
can be important, and in some cases the dominat ones. We study the shape of the
bispectrum and we find that it turns out to peak in the local configuration,
with an amplitude that is modulated by the preferred directions that break

supersymmetric hypermultiplet flavor fields coupled to N=4 supersymmetric
SU(Nc) Yang-Mills theory, formulated on curved four-manifolds, in the limits of
large Nc and large 't Hooft coupling. The gravitational duals are probe
D-branes in global thermal AdS. These D-branes may undergo a topology-changing
transition in the bulk. The D-brane embeddings near the point of the topology
change exhibit a scaling symmetry. The associated scaling exponents can be
either real- or complex-valued. Which regime applies depends on the
dimensionality of a collapsing submanifold in the critical embedding. When the
scaling exponents are complex-valued, a first-order transition associated with
the flavor fields appears in the dual field theory. Real scaling exponents are
expected to be associated with a continuous transition in the dual field
theory. For one example with real exponents, the D7-brane, we study the
transition in detail. We find two field theory observables that diverge at the
critical point, and we compute the associated critical exponents. We also
present analytic and numerical evidence that the transition expresses itself in
the meson spectrum as a non-analyticity at the critical point. We argue that
the transition we study is a true phase transition only when the 't Hooft
coupling is strictly infinite.

struggles is formulated. The underlying set is a closed one, like a country but
in which the population size is variable in time. Several ideologies compete to
increase their number of adepts. Such followers can be either converted from
one ideology to another or become followers of an ideology though being
previously ideologically-free. A reverse process is also allowed. We consider
two kinds of conversion: unitary conversion, e.g. by means of mass
communication tools, or binary conversion, e.g. by means of interactions
between people. It is found that the steady state,when it exists, depends on
the number of ideologies. Moreover when the number of ideologies increases some
tension arises between them. This tension can change in the course of time. We
propose to measure the ideology tensions through an appropriately defined scale
index.

magnetic structure of the intermetallic compound Yb3Pt4, which was earlier
found to order antiferromagnetically at the Neel temperature TN=2.4 K, and
displays a field-driven quantum critical point at 1.6 T. In Yb3Pt4, the Yb
moments sit on a single low-symmetry site in the rhombohedral lattice with
space group R-3. The Yb ions form octahedra with edges that are twisted with
respect to the hexagonal unit cell, a twisting that results in every Yb ion
having exactly one Yb nearest neighbor. Below TN, we found new diffracted
intensity due to a k=0 magnetic structure. This magnetic structure was compared
to all symmetry-allowed magnetic structures, and was subsequently refined. The
best fitting magnetic structure model is antiferromagnetic, and involves pairs
of Yb nearest neighbors on which the moments point almost exactly towards each
other. This structure has moment components within the ab-plane as well as
parallel to the c-axis, although the easy magnetization direction lies in the
ab-plane. Our magnetization results suggest that besides the crystal-electric
field anisotropy, anisotropic exchange favoring alignment along the c-axis is
responsible for the overall direction of the ordered moments. The magnitude of
the ordered Yb moments in Yb3Pt4 is 0.81 uB/Yb at 1.4 K. The analysis of the
bulk properties, the size of the ordered moment, and the observation of
well-defined crystal-field levels argue that the Yb moments are spatially
localized in zero field.

Maxwell's equations in non-uniform media can sometimes be reduced to two 2nd
order differential equations for 2 scalar quantities only. These results have
previously been obtained in two quite different ways. Either by a
``scalarization of the sources'', where the relevant scalar quantities are
essentially vector potential components and where the derivation was limited to
isotropic media; or alternatively by using the ``scalar Hertz potentials'', and
this method has been applied to more general media. In this paper it is shown
that both methods are equivalent for gyrotropic media. We show that the
scalarization can be obtained by a combination of transformations between
electric and magnetic sources and gauge transformations. It is shown that the
method based on the vector potential, which previously used a non-traditional
definition of the vector potentials, can also be obtained using the traditional
definition provided a proper gauge condition is applied and this method is then
extended from isotropic to gyrotropic media. It is shown that the 2 basic
scalar Hertz potentials occurring in the second method are invariant under the
source scalarization transformations of the first method and therefore are the
natural potentials for obtaining scalarization. Finally it is shown that both
methods are also equivalent with a much older third method based on Hertz
vectors.

isolated neutron stars (INSs) discovered in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey, dubbed
the ``Magnificent Seven'' (M7), suggests that they belong to a formerly
neglected major component of the overall INS population. So far, attempts to
discover similar INSs beyond the solar vicinity failed to confirm any reliable
candidate. The EPIC cameras onboard the XMM-Newton satellite allow to
efficiently search for new thermally emitting INSs. We used the 2XMMp catalogue
to select sources with no catalogued candidate counterparts and with X-ray
spectra similar to those of the M7, but seen at greater distances and thus
undergoing higher interstellar absorptions. Identifications in more than 170
astronomical catalogues and visual screening allowed to select fewer than 30
good INS candidates. In order to rule out alternative identifications, we
obtained deep ESO-VLT and SOAR optical imaging for the X-ray brightest
candidates. We report here on the optical follow-up results of our search and
discuss the possible nature of 8 of our candidates. A high X-ray-to-optical
flux ratio together with a stable flux and soft X-ray spectrum make the
brightest source of our sample, 2XMM J104608.7-594306, a newly discovered
thermally emitting INS. The X-ray source 2XMM J010642.3+005032 has no evident
optical counterpart and should be further investigated. The remaining X-ray
sources are most probably identified with CVs and AGN, as inferred from the
colours and flux ratios of their likely optical counterparts. Beyond the
finding of new thermally emitting INSs, our study aims at constraining the
space density of this Galactic population at great distances and at determining
whether their apparently high density is a local anomaly or not.
