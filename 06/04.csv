suggest five new experimental approaches that we anticipate can cover most of
the natural parameter space, using currently operating GeV-energy beams and
well-established detection methods. Such experiments are particularly timely in

the additional fields and interactions needed for minimal gauge mediated
supersymmetry breaking,__and almost nothing else__. Surprisingly, we find that
in all but one Dirac neutrino scenario the messenger fields in the gauge

enhancement point, and rule out both annihilating and decaying dark matter
scenarios as explanations for the recent experiments PAMELA, ATIC and FERMI. In
F-theory GUT models, a 10-100 MeV mass gravitino remains as the prime candidate
for dark matter, thus suggesting an astrophysical origin for recent

studied in a market with one stock, one bond, and proportional transaction

time horizon. With a series of transformations, the problem is turned into a
so-called double obstacle problem, a well studied problem in physics and
partial differential equation literature, featuring two time-varying free
boundaries. The two boundaries, which define the buy, sell, and no-trade
regions, are proved to be smooth in time. This in turn characterizes the
optimal strategy, via a Skorokhod problem, as one that tries to keep a certain
adjusted bond-stock position within the no-trade region. Several features of
the optimal strategy are revealed that are remarkably different from its
no-transaction-cost counterpart. It is shown that there exists a critical
length in time, which is dependent on the stock excess return as well as the
transaction fees but independent of the investment target and the stock
volatility, so that an expected terminal return may not be achievable if the
planning horizon is shorter than that critical length (while in the absence of
transaction costs any expected return can be reached in an arbitrary period of
time). It is further demonstrated that anyone following the optimal strategy
should not buy the stock beyond the point when the time to maturity is shorter
than the aforementioned critical length. Moreover, the investor would be less
likely to buy the stock and more likely to sell the stock when the maturity
date is getting closer. These features, while consistent with the widely
accepted investment wisdom, suggest that the planning horizon is an integral
part of the investment opportunities.

a central supermassive black hole binary. Unlike earlier studies, we consider a
finite mass of gas with explicit time dependence: we do not assume that the gas
necessarily adopts a steady state or a spatially constant accretion rate, i.e.
that the merging black hole was somehow inserted into a pre--existing accretion
disc. We consider the tidal torque of the binary on the disc, and the binary's
gravitational radiation. We study the effects of star formation in the gas disc
in a simple energy feedback framework. The disc spectrum differs in detail from
that found before. In particular, tidal torques from the secondary black hole
heat the edges of the gap, creating bright rims around the secondary. These
rims do not in practice have uniform brightness either in azimuth or time, but
can on average account for as much as 50 per cent of the integrated light from
the disc. This may lead to detectable high--photon--energy variability on the
relatively long orbital timescale of the secondary black hole, and thus offer a
prospective signature of a coalescing black hole binary. We also find that the
disc can drive the binary to merger on a reasonable timescale only if its mass
is at least comparable with that of the secondary black hole, and if the
initial binary separation is relatively small, i.e. $a_0 \lesssim 0.05$ pc.
Star formation complicates the merger further by removing mass from the disc.
In the feedback model we consider, this sets an effective limit to the disc
mass. As a result, binary merging is unlikely unless the black hole mass ratio
is $\la 0.001$. Gas discs thus appear not to be an effective solution to the
`last parsec' problem for a significant class of mergers.

by embedding it in a resonant semiconductor microcavity. This phenomenon is
known as the Purcell effect, and the coupling strength between emitter and
cavity can be quantified by the Purcell factor. The most natural way for
probing the Purcell effect is a time-resolved measurement. However, this
approach is not always the most convenient one, and alternative approaches
based on a continuous-wave measurement are often more appropriate. Various
signatures of the Purcell effect can indeed be observed using continuous-wave
measurements (increase of the pump rate needed to saturate the quantum dot
emission, enhancement of its emission rate at saturation, change of its
radiation pattern), signatures which are encountered when a quantum dot is put
on-resonance with the cavity mode. All these observations potentially allow one
to estimate the Purcell factor. In this paper, we carry out these different
types of measurements for a single quantum dot in a pillar microcavity and we
compare their reliability. We include in the data analysis the presence of
independent, non-resonant emitters in the microcavity environment, which are
responsible for a part of the observed fluorescence.

focused in the realistic assumption that the synapses in the network present
activity-dependent processes, such as short-term synaptic depression and
facilitation. Employing mean-field techniques as well as numerical simulations,
we found that there are two possible noise levels which optimize signal
transmission. This new finding is in contrast with the classical theory of
stochastic resonance which is able to predict only one optimal level of noise.
We found that the complex interplay between the nonlinear dynamics of the

for this new phenomenology. Our results are confirmed by employing a more

and stellar content of its disk and halo. In this review, we discuss these
recent findings in the framework of M82 as a galaxy. It is known for almost
half a century that M82 as a galaxy doesn't follow the trends expected for
normal galaxies that had prompted the morphologists to introduce a separate
morphological type under the name Irr II or amorphous. It is now being
understood that the main reasons behind its apparently distinct morphological
appearance are its peculiar star formation history, radial distribution of gas
density and the form of the rotation curve. The disk formed almost all of its
stars through a burst mode around 500 Myr ago, with the disk star formation
completely quenched around 100 Myr ago. The fossil record of the disk-wide
burst lies in the form of hundreds of compact star clusters, similar in mass to
that of the globular clusters in the Milky Way, but an order of magnitude
younger. The present star formation is restricted entirely to the central 500
pc zone, that contains more than 200 young compact star clusters. The disk
contains a non-star-forming spiral arm, hidden from the optical view by a
combination of extinction and high inclination to the line of sight. The halo
of M82 is also unusual in its stellar content, with evidence for star
formation, albeit at low levels, occurring continuously for over a gigayear. We
carefully examine each of the observed abnormality to investigate the overall
effect of interaction on the evolution of M82.

thickening of disc galaxies during minor mergers. We produce a suite of minor
merger simulations for Milky Way-like galaxies. This suite consists of
collisionless simulations as well as hydrodynamical runs including a gaseous
component in the galactic disc. We find that in dissipationless simulations
minor mergers cause the scale height of the disc to increase by up to a factor
of ~2. When the presence of gas in the disc is taken into account this
thickening is reduced by 25% (50%) for an initial disc gas fraction of 20%
(40%), leading to a final scale height z0 between 0.6 and 0.7 kpc, regardless
of the initial scale height. We argue that the presence of gas reduces disc
heating via two mechanisms: absorption of kinetic impact energy by the gas
and/or formation of a new thin stellar disc that can cause heated stars to
recontract towards the disc plane. We show that in our simulations most of the
gas is consumed during the merger and thus the regrowth of a new thin disc has
a negligible impact on the z0 of the post merger galaxy. Final disc scale
heights found in our simulations are in good agreement with studies of the
vertical structure of spiral galaxies where the majority of the systems are
found to have scale heights of 0.4 kpc < z0 < 0.8 kpc. We also found no tension
between recent measurements of the scale height of the Milky Way thin disc and
results coming from our hydrodynamical simulations. We conclude that the
existence of a thin disc in the Milky Way and in external galaxies is not in
obvious conflict with the predictions of the CDM model.

the asteroseismic large frequency spacing, obtained from simulations of 4-year

can be correctly and precisely determined, when combined with traditional
stellar parameters from the Kepler Input Catalogue. The radii found by the
various methods used by each independent hound generally agree with the true
values of the artificial stars to within 3%, when the large frequency spacing
is used. This is 5--10 times better than the results where seismology is not
applied. These results give strong confidence that radius estimation can be
performed to better than 3% for solar-like stars using automatic pipeline
reduction. Even when the stellar distance and luminosity are unknown we can
obtain the same level of agreement.

(~27^{+8}_{-6}%), >50% of which are not identified as AGNs using optical
spectroscopy. The large AGN fraction indicates a tighter connection between AGN
activity and IR luminosity for galaxies in the local Universe than previously
found, potentially indicating a close association between AGN activity and star
formation. The optically unidentified AGNs span a wide range of galaxy type
(S0-Ir) and are typically starburst-dominated systems hosting modest-luminosity
AGN activity (L_[NeV] ~ 10^37 - 10^39 erg s^-1). The non-identification of
optical AGN signatures in the majority of these galaxies appears to be due to
extinction towards the AGN, rather than intrinsically low-luminosity AGN
activity. Examination of optical images shows that the optically unidentified
AGNs with evidence for extinction are hosted in either highly inclined galaxies
or galaxies with dust lanes, indicating that obscuration of the AGN is not
necessarily due to an obscuring torus. We therefore conclude that optical
spectroscopic surveys miss approximately half of the AGN population simply due
to extinction through the host galaxy.

porous grain aggregates with olivine monomers. The small and large angle
scattering properties of these aggregates are governed by the global structure

them to a Chandra measurement of the dust halo around the Galactic binary
GX13+1. Grain aggregates with porosities higher than about 0.55 are ruled out.
Future high-precision observations of X-ray dust haloes together with detailed
modeling of the X-ray scattering properties of porous grain mixtures will
further constrain the presence of porous grain aggregates in a given dust

resolve mixing at fluid boundaries. We use an error and stability analysis of
the generalised SPH equations of motion to prove that this is due to two
distinct problems. The first is a leading order error in the momentum equation.
This should decrease with increasing neighbour number, but does not because
numerical instabilities cause the kernel to be irregularly sampled. We identify
two important instabilities: the clumping instability and the banding
instability, and we show that both are cured by a suitable choice of kernel.
The second problem is the local mixing instability (LMI). This occurs as
particles attempt to mix on the kernel scale, but are unable to due to entropy
conservation. The result is a pressure discontinuity at boundaries that pushes
fluids of different entropy apart. We cure the LMI by using a weighted density
estimate that ensures that pressures are single valued throughout the flow.
This also gives a better volume estimate for the particles, reducing errors in
the continuity and momentum equations. We demonstrate mixing in our new
Optimised Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (OSPH) scheme using a Kelvin
Helmholtz instability (KHI) test with density contrast 1:2, and the 'blob test'
- a 1:10 density ratio gas sphere in a wind tunnel - finding excellent
agreement between OSPH and Eulerian codes.

in the range 10^6 to 10^8 M_sun and half-light radii of 10-100 pc. The most
massive UCDs known to date are predominantly metal-rich and reside in the cores
of nearby galaxy clusters. The question arises whether UCDs are just the most
massive globular clusters in rich globular cluster systems? Although UCDs and
`normal' GCs form a continuous sequence in several parameter spaces, there
seems to be a break in the scaling laws for stellar systems with masses above
~2.5x10^6 M_sun. Unlike GCs, UCDs follow a mass-size relation and their
mass-to-light ratios are about twice as large as those of GCs with comparable
metallicities. In this contribution, I present the properties of the brightest
globular clusters and ultra-compact dwarf galaxies and discuss whether the
observed findings are compatible with a `star-cluster' origin of UCDs or
whether they are more likely related to dark matter dominated dwarf galaxies.

systems in the classical problem of shallow water waves. The starting point in
our derivation is the Euler equation for an incompressible fluid, the equation
of mass conservation, the simplest bottom and surface conditions and the
constant vorticity condition. The approximate model equations are generated by
introduction of suitable scalings and by truncating asymptotic expansions of
the quantities to appropriate order. The so obtained equations can be related
to three different integrable systems: a two component generalization of the
Camassa-Holm equation, the Zakharov-Ito system and the Kaup-Boussinesq system.
  The significance of the results is the inclusion of vorticity, an important
feature of water waves that has been given increasing attention during the last
decade. The presented investigation shows how -- up to a certain order -- the
model equations relate to the shear flow upon which the wave resides. In
particular, it shows exactly how the constant vorticity affects the equations.

by non-processive myosin motors. We show that even if the power stroke of the
motor protein has no lateral component, the filaments will rotate around their
axis while moving over the surface. Notably, the handedness of this twirling
motion is opposite from that of the actin filament structure. It stems from the
fact that the gliding actin filament has ""target zones"" where its subunits
point towards the surface and are therefore more accessible for myosin heads.
Each myosin head has a higher binding probability before it reaches the center
of the target zone than afterwards, which results in a left-handed twirling. We
present a stochastic simulation and an approximative analytical solution. The
calculated pitch of the twirling motion depends on the filament velocity (ATP
concentration). It reaches about 400nm for low speeds and increases with higher
speeds.

3C390.3. The Fe Ka line has a width FWHM ~ 8,800 km/s, consistent within a
factor two with the width of the double-peaked H_alpha line, suggesting an
origin from the Broad Line Region. The data show for the first time a weak,
broad bump extending from 5 to 7 keV. When fitted with a Gaussian, its centroid
energy is 6.6 keV in the source's rest-frame with FWHM of 43,000 km/s and EW of
50 eV; its most likely interpretation is emission from He-like Fe (Fe XXV),
suggesting the presence of an ionized medium in the inner regions of 3C390.3.
The broad-band 0.5-100 keV continuum is well described by a single power law
with photon index Gamma=1.6 and cutoff energy 157 keV, plus cold reflection
with strength R=0.5. In addition, ionized reflection is required to account for
the 6.6 keV bump in the broad-band continuum, yielding an ionization parameter
xi ~ 2700 ergs cm s^-1; the inner radius of the ionized reflector is
constrained to be larger than 20 r_G, although this result depends on the
assumed emissivity profile of the disk. If true, we argue that the lack of
broad Fe K emission from within 20 r_G indicates that the innermost regions of
the disk in 3C390.3 are obscured and/or poorly illuminated. While the SED of
3C390.3 is generally dominated by accretion-related continuum, during accretion
low states the jet can significantly contribute in the optical to X-ray bands
via synchrotron self-Compton emission. (Abridged)

mass $M$ in which large $\gamma$ has been found to be almost independent of an

emerges and is optimized by doping the Mott insulator is one of the major
outstanding problems in condensed matter physics. Our high-resolution scanning
tunneling microscopy measurements of the high transition temperature (Tc)
superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+d show that samples with different Tcs in the low
doping regime follow a remarkably universal d-wave low energy excitation
spectrum, indicating a doping independent nodal gap. We demonstrate that Tc
instead correlates with the fraction of the Fermi surface over which the
samples exhibit the universal spectrum. Optimal Tc is achieved when all parts
of the Fermi surface follow this universal behavior. Increasing temperature
above Tc turns the universal spectrum into an arc of gapless excitations, while
overdoping breaks down the universal nodal behavior.

investigate the difference between rational connectedness and separable
rational connectedness in positive characteristic. The notion of being freely
rationally connected is defined; a variety is freely rationally connected if a
general pair of points can be connected by a free rational curve. It is proved
that a freely rationally connected variety admits a finite purely inseparable
morphism to a separably rationally connected variety. As an application, a
generalized Graber-Harris-Starr type theorem in positive characteristic is
proved; namely, if a family of varieties over a smooth curve has the property
that its geometric generic fiber is normal and freely rationally connected,
then it has a rational section after some Frobenius twisting. We also show that
a freely rationally connected variety is simply connected.

A number of unidentified absorption features (arising in the diffuse
inter-stellar medium), usually called ``Diffuse Inter-stellar Bands (DIBs)'',
are hypothesized to be produced by large molecules. Among these,
buckminsterfullerene C_60 has gained much attention as a candidate for DIB
absorbers because of its high stability in space. Two DIBs at ~9577A and 9632A
have been reported as possible features of C_60^+. However, it is still not
clear how their existence depends on their environment. We obtained
high-resolution spectra of three stars in/around the Orion Nebula, to search
for any correlations of the DIB strength with carrier's physical conditions,
such as dust-abundance and UV radiation field. We find three DIBs at ~9017A,
9210A, and 9258A as additional C_60^+ feature candidates, which could support
this identification. These DIBs have asymmetric profiles similar to the longer
wavelength features. However, we also find that the relative strengths of DIBs
are close to unity and differ from laboratory measurements, a similar trend as
noticed for the 9577/9632 DIBs.

of an unequal mass binary black hole with a coplanar gas disk that contains a
gap due to the presence of the secondary black hole. Viscous evolution of the
outer circumbinary disk initially hardens the binary, while the inner disk
drains onto the primary (central) black hole. As long as the inner disk remains
cool and thin at low $\dot{M}_{\rm ext}$ (rather than becoming hot and
geometrically thick), the mass of the inner disk reaches an asymptotic mass
typically $\sim 10^{-3}-10^{-4}\Msun$. Once the semimajor axis shrinks below a
critical value, angular momentum losses from gravitational waves dominate over
viscous transport in hardening the binary. The inner disk then no longer
responds viscously to the inspiraling black holes. Instead, tidal interactions
with the secondary rapidly drive the inner disk into the primary. Tidal and
viscous dissipation in the inner disk lead to a late time brightening in
luminosity $L\propto t_{\rm minus}^{5/4}$, where $t_{\rm minus}$ is the time
prior to the final merger. This late time brightening peaks $\sim 1$ day prior
to the final merger at $\sim 0.1 L_{\rm Edd}$. This behavior is relatively
robust because of self regulation in the coupled viscous-gravitational
evolution of such binary systems. It constitutes a unique electromagnetic
signature of a binary supermassive black hole merger and may allow the host
galaxy to be identified if used in conjunction with the Laser Interferometric
Space Antenna (LISA) localization.

soft-output MIMO detection in Studer, et al., IEEE J-SAC, 2008. The new
algorithm incorporates clipping of the extrinsic log-likelihood ratios (LLRs)
into the tree-search, which results in significant complexity savings and
allows to cover a large performance/complexity tradeoff region by adjusting a
single parameter. Furthermore, we propose a new method for correcting
approximate LLRs --resulting from sub-optimal detectors-- which (often
significantly) improves detection performance at low additional computational
complexity.

magnetized accretion flows. It is usually proposed that hyperaccreting disks
surrounding stellar-mass black holes with a huge accretion rate are central
engines of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). However, hyperaccretion disks around
neutron stars may exist in some GRB formation scenarios. We study the structure
and neutrino emission of a hyperaccretion disk around a neutron star. We
consider a steady-state hyperaccretion disk, and as a reasonable approximation,
divide it into two regions, the inner and outer disks. The outer disk is
similar to that of a black hole. The inner disk has a self-similar structure,
such as the entropy-conservation or the advection structure, depending on the
energy transfer and emission in the disk. We see that the neutron star disk can
cool more efficiently, produce much higher neutrino luminosity and neutrino
annihilation luminosity than a black hole disk. The neutrino emission from the
neutron star surface boundary layer could increase the neutrino annihilation
luminosity.
  Moreover, we study the effects of a global magnetic field on
viscously-rotating and vertically-integrated accretion disks around compact
objects using a self-similar treatment, and use two methods to study magnetized
flows with convection. We also give a review on GRB progenitors, central
engines and an outlook in this thesis.

fairly high fractal dimension () which are directly responsible for the
observed rheological properties of sheared dispersions. We address the problem
of the decrease of aggregate size with increasing hydrodynamic stress, as a
consequence of breakup, by means of a fracture-mechanics model complemented by
experiments in a multi-pass extensional (laminar) flow device. Evidence is
shown that as long as the inner density decay with linear size within the
aggregate (due to fractality) is not negligible (as for), this imposes a
substantial limitation to the hydrodynamic fragmentation process as compared
with non-fractal aggregates (where the critical stress is practically
size-independent). This is due to the fact that breaking up a fractal object
leads to denser fractals which better withstand stress. In turbulent flows,
accounting for intermittency introduces just a small deviation with respect to
the laminar case, while the model predictions are equally in good agreement
with experiments from the literature. Our findings are summarized in a diagram
for the breakup exponent (governing the size versus stress scaling) as a

high-resolution direct numerical simulations (DNS) of freely decaying and

considered. In agreement with experimental results strong rotation is found to
lead to anisotropy of the direct nonlinear energy flux, which is attenuated
primarily in the direction of the rotation axis. In decaying turbulence the
evolution of kinetic energy follows an approximate power law with a distinct
dependence of the decay exponent on the rotation frequency. A simple
phenomenological relation between exponent and rotation rate reproduces this
observation. Stationary turbulence driven by large-scale forcing exhibits
$k_\perp^{-2}$-scaling in the rotation-dominated inertial range of the
one-dimensional energy spectrum taken perpendicularly to the rotation axis. The
self-similar scaling is shown to be the cumulative result of individual
spectral contributions which, for low rotation rate, display
$k_\perp^{-3}$-scaling near the $k_\parallel=0$ plane. A phenomenology which
incorporates the modification of the energy cascade by rotation is proposed. In
the observed regime the nonlinear turbulent interactions are strongly
influenced by rotation but not suppressed. {Longitudinal two-point velocity

intermittency of the $k_\parallel=0$ (2D) component of the flow while the

detailed presentation of the fundamental MHD equations appropriate for
protostellar disks is given. The combination of a weak (subthermal) magnetic
field and Keplerian rotation is unstable to the magnetorotational instability
(MRI), if the degree of ionization in the disk is sufficiently high. The MRI
produces enhanced angular momentum and leads to a breakdown of laminar flow
into turbulence. If the turbulent energy is dissipated locally, standard
""$\alpha$"" modeling should give a reasonable estimate for the disk structure.
Because away from the central star the ionization fraction of protostellar
disks is small, they are generally not in the regime of near perfect
conductivity. Nonideal MHD effects are important. Of these, Ohmic dissipation
and Hall electromotive forces are the most important. The presence of dust is
also critical, as small interstellar scale grains absorb free charges that are
needed for good magnetic coupling. On scales of AU's there may be a region near
the disk midplane that is magnetically decoupled, a so-called {\em dead zone.}
But the growth and settling of the grains as time evolves reduces their
efficiency to absorb charge. With ionization provided by coronal X-rays from
the central star (and possibly also cosmic rays), protostellar disks may be
sufficiently magnetized throughout most of their lives to be MRI active,
especially away from the disk midplane.

cross section for the deuteron is larger than those for $^{3}$H, $^{3}$He and
$^{4}$He for neutrino temperatures (T$_\nu$ $\sim 4$ MeV) relevant to supernova
core. Because of the low energy threshold for the deuteron breakup, the energy
transfer rate rapidly increases from low temperature, T$_\nu$ $\sim 1$ MeV.
This suggests that the neutrino deuteron reactions may contribute effectively
to the heating mechanism during the dissociation of irons into light elements

full description of minimax rates of estimation of $g$ in terms of $\gamma$ and
$\beta$, and propose rate-optimal estimators for the sup-norm loss. For the
construction of such estimators, we first prove an approximation result for
composite functions that may have an independent interest, and then a result on
adaptation to the local structure. Interestingly, the construction of
rate-optimal estimators for composite functions (with given, fixed smoothness)
needs adaptation, but not in the traditional sense: it is now adaptation to the
local structure. We prove that composition models generate only two types of
local structures: the local single-index model and the local model with
roughness isolated to a single dimension (i.e., a model containing elements of
both additive and single-index structure). We also find the zones of ($\gamma$,
$\beta$) where no local structure is generated, as well as the zones where the
composition modeling leads to faster rates, as compared to the classical
nonparametric rates that depend only to the overall smoothness of $g$.

flaring occurs in all three masing transitions. It is shown that the average
flare profiles of the three masing transitions are similar. The 12.2 GHz masers
are the most variable of the three masers with the largest relative amplitude
having a value of 2.4. The flux densities for the different masing transitions
are found to return to the same level during the low phase of the masers,
suggesting that the source of the periodic flaring is situated outside the
masing region, and that the physical conditions in the masing region are
relatively stable. On the basis of the shape of the light curve we excluded
stellar pulsations as the underlying mechanism for the periodicity. It is
argued that a colliding wind binary can account for the observed periodicity
and provide a mechanism to qualitatively explain periodicity in the seed photon
flux and/or the pumping radiation field. It is also argued that the dust
cooling time is too short to explain the decay time of about 100 days of the
maser flare. A further analysis has shown that for the intervals from days 48
to 66 and from days 67 to 135 the decay of the maser light curve can be
interpreted as due to the recombination of a thermal hydrogen plasma with
densities of approximately $1.6 \times 10^6 \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ and $6.0 \times
10^5 \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ respectively.

central research topic in data mining and various efficient mining sequential
patterns algorithms have been proposed and studied. Recently, in many problem
domains (e.g, program execution traces), a novel sequential pattern mining
research, called mining repetitive gapped sequential patterns, has attracted
the attention of many researchers, considering not only the repetition of
sequential pattern in different sequences but also the repetition within a
sequence is more meaningful than the general sequential pattern mining which
only captures occurrences in different sequences. However, the number of
repetitive gapped sequential patterns generated by even these closed mining
algorithms may be too large to understand for users, especially when support
threshold is low. In this paper, we propose and study the problem of
compressing repetitive gapped sequential patterns. Inspired by the ideas of
summarizing frequent itemsets, RPglobal, we develop an algorithm, CRGSgrow
(Compressing Repetitive Gapped Sequential pattern grow), including an efficient
pruning strategy, SyncScan, and an efficient representative pattern checking
scheme, -dominate sequential pattern checking. The CRGSgrow is a two-step
approach: in the first step, we obtain all closed repetitive sequential
patterns as the candidate set of representative repetitive sequential patterns,
and at the same time get the most of representative repetitive sequential
patterns; in the second step, we only spend a little time in finding the
remaining the representative patterns from the candidate set. An empirical
study with both real and synthetic data sets clearly shows that the CRGSgrow
has good performance.

  Yasso07 model","19 Pages, to appear in Ecological Modelling",,,,"q-bio.OT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Litter decomposition is an important process in the global carbon cycle. It
accounts for most of the heterotrophic soil respiration and results in
formation of more stable soil organic carbon (SOC) which is the largest
terrestrial carbon stock. Litter decomposition may induce remarkable feedbacks
to climate change because it is a climate-dependent process. To investigate the
global patterns of litter decomposition, we developed a description of this
process and tested the validity of this description using a large set of foliar
litter mass loss measurements (nearly 10 000 data points derived from
approximately 70 000 litter bags). We applied the Markov chain Monte Carlo
method to estimate uncertainty in the parameter values and results of our model
called Yasso07. The model appeared globally applicable. It estimated the
effects of litter type (plant species) and climate on mass loss with little
systematic error over the first 10 decomposition years, using only initial
litter chemistry, air temperature and precipitation as input variables.
Illustrative of the global variability in litter mass loss rates, our example
calculations showed that a typical conifer litter had 68% of its initial mass
still remaining after two decomposition years in tundra while a deciduous
litter had only 15% remaining in the tropics. Uncertainty in these estimates, a
direct result of the uncertainty of the parameter values of the model, varied
according to the distribution of the litter bag data among climate conditions
and ranged from 2% in tundra to 4% in the tropics. This reliability was
adequate to use the model and distinguish the effects of even small differences
in litter quality or climate conditions on litter decomposition as
statistically significant.

a precious tool for studying the planetary migration ; however, some
approximations have to be made. Most often, the selfgravity of the gas is
neglected. In that case, it is not clear in the literature how the material
inside the Roche lobe of the planet should be taken into account. Here, we want
to address this issue by studying the influence of various methods so far used
by different authors on the migration rate.
  We performed high-resolution numerical simulations of giant planets embedded
in discs. We compared the migration rates with and without gas selfgravity,
testing various ways of taking the circum-planetary disc (CPD) into account.
Different methods lead to significantly different migration rates. Adding the
mass of the CPD to the perturbing mass of the planet accelerates the migration.
Excluding a part of the Hill sphere is a very touchy parameter that may lead to
an artificial suppression of the type III, runaway migration. In fact, the CPD
is smaller than the Hill sphere. We recommend excluding no more than a 0.6 Hill
radius and using a smooth filter. Alternatively, the CPD can be given the
acceleration felt by the planet from the rest of the protoplanetary disc.
  The gas inside the Roche lobe of the planet should be very carefully taken
into account in numerical simulations without any selfgravity of the gas. The
entire Hill sphere should not be excluded. The method used should be explicitly
given. However, no method is equivalent to computing the full selfgravity of
the gas.

The second article addresses symmetry-breaking by displacement of the leads.
Using semiclassics, we identify the origin of the symmetry-induced interference
effects that contribute to weak-localization corrections and universal
conductance fluctuations. For perfect spatial symmetry, we recover results
previously found using the random-matrix theory conjecture. We then go on to
show how the results are affected by asymmetries in the dot, magnetic fields
and decoherence. In particular, the symmetry-asymmetry crossover is found to be
described by a universal dependence on an asymmetry parameter $\gamma_{asym}$.
However, the form of this parameter is very different depending on how the dot
is deformed away from spatial symmetry. Symmetry-induced interference effects
are completely destroyed when the dot's boundary is globally deformed by less
than an electron wavelength. In contrast, these effects are only reduced by a
finite amount when a part of the dot's boundary smaller than a lead-width is
deformed an arbitrarily large distance.

patterns with respect to a specific function have evolved through mutations.
This has been observed in the evolution of proteins for realizing folding
dynamics through which a target structure is shaped. We study this evolutionary
process by introducing a statistical-mechanical model of interacting spins,
where a configuration of spins and their interactions $\bm{J}$ represent a
phenotype and genotype, respectively. The phenotype dynamics are given by a
stochastic process with temperature $T_{S}$ under a Hamiltonian with $\bm{J}$.
The evolution of $\bm{J}$ is also stochastic with temperature $T_{J}$ and
follows mutations introduced into $\bm{J}$ and selection based on a fitness
defined for a configuration of a given set of target spins. Below a certain
temperature $T_{S}^{c2}$, the interactions $\bm{J}$ that achieve the target
pattern evolve, whereas another phase transition is observed at
$T_{S}^{c1}<T_{S}^{c2}$. At low temperatures $T_{S}<T_{S}^{c1}$, the
Hamiltonian exhibits a spin-glass like phase, where the dynamics toward the
target pattern require long time steps, and the fitness often decreases
drastically as a result of a single mutation to $\bm{J}$. In the
intermediate-temperature region, the dynamics to shape the target pattern
proceed rapidly and are robust to mutations of $\bm{J}$. The interactions in
this region have no frustration around the target pattern and results in
funnel-type dynamics. We propose that the ubiquity of funnel-type dynamics, as
observed in protein folding, is a consequence of evolution subjected to thermal
noise beyond a certain level; this also leads to mutational robustness of the
fitness.

reproduce a few features of the $\Lambda$CDM model, but do not contain the
giant cosmic void. We propose to use two sets of data - the angular diameter
distance together with the redshift-space mass-density and the angular diameter
distance together with the expansion rate - both defined on the past null cone
as functions of the redshift. We assume that these functions are of the same
form as in the $\Lambda$CDM model. Using the Mustapha-Hellaby-Ellis algorithm,
we numerically transform these initial data into the usual two L-T arbitrary
functions and solve the evolution equation to calculate the mass distribution
in spacetime. For both models, we find that the current density profile does
not exhibit a giant void, but rather a giant hump. However, this hump is not
directly observable, since it is in a spacelike relation to a present observer.
The alleged existence of the giant void was a consequence of the L-T models
used earlier because their generality was limited a priori by needless
simplifying assumptions, like, for example, the bang-time function being
constant. Instead, one can feed any mass distribution or expansion rate history
on the past light cone as initial data to the L-T evolution equation. When a
fully general L-T metric is used, the giant void is not implied.

extracted from the oscillator measurement outcomes, and the QND character of
the measurement is inferred by the result of subsequent measurements of the
oscillator. We use the positive operator valued measure (POVM) formalism to
describe the qubit measurement. Two mechanisms lead to deviations from a
perfect QND measurement: (i) the quantum fluctuations of the oscillator, and
(ii) quantum tunneling between the qubit states $|0>$ and $|1>$ during
measurements. Our theory can be applied to QND measurements performed on
superconducting qubits coupled to a circuit oscillator.

validity of this idea has recently been brought into doubt [1]. Motivated by
this, we present a graviton action for which energy-momentum self-coupling is
indeed consistent with the Einstein field equations. The Hilbert
energy-momentum tensor for this graviton is calculated explicitly and shown to
supply the correct second-order term in the field equations; in contrast, the
Fierz-Pauli action fails to supply the correct term. A formalism for
perturbative expansions of metric-based gravitational theories is then
developed, and these techniques employed to demonstrate that our graviton
action is a starting point for a straightforward energy-momentum self-coupling
procedure that, order by order, generates the Einstein-Hilbert action (up to a
classically irrelevant surface term). The perturbative formalism is extended to
include matter and a cosmological constant, and interactions between
perturbations of a free matter field and the gravitational field are studied in
a vacuum background. Finally, the effect of a non-vacuum background is
examined, and the graviton is found to develop a non-vanishing ``mass-term'' in

arbitrary electromagnetic field. This potential is a modification of the two
scalar potential functions introduced by E. T. Whittaker. By use of a
complexified Minkowski space $M$, we decompose the usual Lorentz group
representation on $M$ into a product of two commuting new representations.
These representations are based on the complex Faraday tensor. For a moving
charge and for any observer, we obtain a complex dimensionless scalar which is
invariant under one of our new representations. The scalar complex potential is
the logarithm of this dimensionless scalar times the charge value. We define a
conjugation on $M$ which is invariant under our representation. We show that
the Faraday tensor is the derivative of the conjugate of the gradient of the
complex potential. The real part of the Faraday tensor coincides with the usual
electromagnetic tensor of the field.
  The potential $\mathcal{S}$, as a complex-valued function on space-time, is
described as an integral over the distribution of the charges generating the
electromagnetic field. This potential is like a wave function description of
the field. If we chose the Bondi tetrad (called also Newman-Penrose basis) as a
basis on $M$, the components of the Faraday vector at each point may be derived
from $\mathcal{S}$ by $ F_j=E_j+iB_j={\partial}^\nu
(\alpha_j)_\nu^\lambda{\partial}_\lambda \mathcal{S}$, where $(\alpha_j)$ are
the known $\alpha$-matrices of Dirac. This fact indicates that our potential
may build a ""bridge"" between classical and quantum physics.

and effective nuclear interactions. The ratio of the bulk symmetry energy J to
the so-called surface stiffness coefficient Q has in the droplet model a
prominent role in driving the size of neutron skins. We present a correlation
between the density derivative of the nuclear symmetry energy at saturation and
the J/Q ratio. We emphasize the role of the surface widths of the neutron and
proton density profiles in the calculation of the neutron skin thickness when
one uses realistic mean-field effective interactions. Next, taking as
experimental baseline the neutron skin sizes measured in 26 antiprotonic atoms
along the mass table, we explore constraints arising from neutron skins on the
value of the J/Q ratio. The results favor a relatively soft symmetry energy at
subsaturation densities. Our predictions are compared with the recent
constraints derived from other experimental observables. Though the various
extractions predict different ranges of values, one finds a narrow window L ~
45-75 MeV for the coefficient L that characterizes the density derivative of
the symmetry energy which is compatible with all the different empirical
indications.

shell. We report new observations of the shell with HST. The knots in the shell
are expanding with velocities 500-715 km/s, for a distance of 3500 pc. The
fractional expansion of the knots is constant, and this implies no significant
deceleration. Hence, the knots were ejected by an eruption close to the year
1866. Knots have turned on after 1995, and this demonstrates that the knots are
powered by shocks from the collision of the 1866 ejecta with fast ejecta from
later RN eruptions. The 1866 ejecta has a total mass of 10^-4.5 Msun, which
with the low ejection velocity shows that the 1866 event was an ordinary nova
eruption, not a RN eruption. The accretion rate before the ordinary nova event
must have been low (around the 4x10^-11 Msun/yr expected for gravitational
radiation alone) and the matter accumulated on the surface of the white dwarf
for ~750,000 years. The current accretion rate (>10^-8 Msun/yr) is 1000X higher
than expected for a system below the period gap, with the plausible reason
being that the 1866 event started a continuing supersoft source that drives the
accretion. A key fact about T Pyx is that its accretion rate has been secularly
declining since before the 1890 eruption, with the current rate being only 3%
of its earlier rate. The decline in the observed accretion rate shows that the
supersoft source is not self-sustaining, and we calculate that the accretion in
T Pyx will effectively stop in upcoming decades. With this, T Pyx will enter a
state of hibernation, lasting for an estimated 2,600,000 years, before
gravitational radiation brings the system into contact again. Thus, T Pyx has
an evolutionary cycle going from an ordinary CV state, to its current RN state,
to a future hibernation state, and then repeating this cycle.

harder to detect any such anisotropy.

We focus especially upon cases where M1/M2 are lattice matched (i.e., have the
same crystal structure and the same lattice parameters to within ~ 1%), because
in these cases no-free-parameter calculations of 2AR agree surprisingly well
with measured values. But we also list and briefly discuss cases where M1/M2
are not lattice matched, either having different crystal structures, or lattice
parameters that differ by several percent. The published calculations of 2AR in
these latter cases do not agree so well with measured values.

strongly the t-$^3$He relative and differential flows than the $\pi^-/\pi^+$
