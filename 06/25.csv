spherically symmetric initial conditions. Our N-body code integrates the
geodesic deviation equation in order to track the streams and caustics
associated with individual simulation particles. The radial orbit instability
causes our haloes to develop major-to-minor axis ratios approaching 10 to 1 in
their inner regions. They grow similarly in time and have similar density
profiles to the spherical similarity solution, but their detailed structure is
very different. The higher dimensionality of the orbits causes their stream and
caustic densities to drop much more rapidly than in the similarity solution.
This results in a corresponding increase in the number of streams at each
point. At 1% of the turnaround radius (corresponding roughly to the Sun's
position in the Milky Way) we find of order 10^6 streams in our simulations, as
compared to 10^2 in the similarity solution. The number of caustics in the
inner halo increases by a factor of several, because a typical orbit has six
turning points rather than one, but caustic densities drop by a much larger
factor. This reduces the caustic contribution to the annihilation radiation.
For the region between 1% and 50% of the turnaround radius, this is 4% of the
total in our simulated haloes, as compared to 6.5% in the similarity solution.
Caustics contribute much less at smaller radii. These numbers assume a 100 GeV
c^-2 neutralino with present-day velocity dispersion 0.03 cm s^-1, but reducing
the dispersion by ten orders of magnitude only doubles the caustic luminosity.
We conclude that caustics will be unobservable in the inner parts of haloes.
Only the outermost caustic might potentially be detectable.

formalism is based on an excited-state fixed-node approximation and the mixed
estimator of the excited-state probability density. The fixed-node ground state
wave-functions of inequivalent nodal pockets are found simultaneously using a
recursive approach. The decay of the wave-function into lower energy states is
prevented using two methods: i) The projection of the improved trial-wave
function into previously calculated eigenstates is removed. ii) The reference
energy for each nodal pocket is adjusted in order to create a kink in the
global fixed-node wave-function which, when locally smoothed out, increases the
volume of the higher energy pockets at the expense of the lower energy ones
until the energies of every pocket become equal. This reference energy method
is designed to find nodal structures that are local minima for arbitrary
fluctuations of the nodes within a given nodal topology. We demonstrate in a
model system that the algorithm converges to many-body eigenstates in
bosonic-like and fermionic cases.

We identify one narrow nuclear level in B9, E_{5/2^+} \simeq 16.7 MeV that is

critical strength of the intra-band repulsion, the system favors an exotic
extended d-wave instability on the enlarged hole pockets at much lower T_c. At
half filling, we find that a strong momentum dependence of inter-band pair
hopping yields an extended s-wave instability instead of spin-density wave

distinct characteristics of their Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) allowed us
to launch a more systematic search for binaries. We selected post-AGB objects
which show a broad dust excess often starting already at H or K, pointing to
the presence of a gravitationally bound dusty disc in the system. We started a
very extensive multi-wavelength study of those systems and here we report on
our radial velocity and photometric monitoring results for six stars of early F
type, which are pulsators of small amplitude. To determine the radial velocity
of low signal-to-noise time-series, we constructed dedicated auto-correlation
masks. The radial velocity variations were subjected to detailed analysis to
differentiate between pulsational variability and variability due to orbital
motion. Finally orbital minimalisation was performed to constrain the orbital
elements. All of the six objects are binaries, with orbital periods ranging
from 120 to 1800 days. Five systems have non-circular orbits. The mass
functions range from 0.004 to 0.57 solar mass and the companions are likely
unevolved objects of (very) low initial mass. We argue that these binaries must
have been subject to severe binary interaction when the primary was a cool
supergiant. Although the origin of the circumstellar disc is not well
understood, the disc is generally believed to be formed during this strong
interaction phase. The eccentric orbits of these highly evolved objects remain
poorly understood. With the measured orbits and mass functions we conclude that
the circumbinary discs seem to have a major impact on the evolution of a
significant fraction of binary systems.

(RRW) $\{W_n\}$ exhibits non-standard behavior, even for light-tailed increment
distributions with negative drift. The Large Deviation Principle (LDP) holds
for deviations below the mean, but for deviations at the usual speed above the
mean the rate function is null. This paper takes a deeper look at this
phenomenon. Conditional on a large sample mean, a complete sample path LDP
analysis is obtained. Let $I$ denote the rate function for the one dimensional
increment process. If $I$ is coercive, then given a large simulated mean
position, under general conditions our results imply that the most likely
asymptotic behavior, $\psi^*$, of the paths $n^{-1} W_{\lfloor tn\rfloor}$ is
to be zero apart from on an interval $[T_0,T_1]\subset[0,1]$ and to satisfy the
functional equation \begin{align*} \nabla
I\left(\ddt\psi^*(t)\right)=\lambda^*(T_1-t) \quad \text{whenever } \psi(t)\neq
0. \end{align*} If $I$ is non-coercive, a similar, but slightly more involved,
result holds.
  These results prove, in broad generality, that Monte Carlo estimates of the
steady-state mean position of a RRW have a high likelihood of over-estimation.
This has serious implications for the performance evaluation of queueing
systems by simulation techniques where steady state expected queue-length and
waiting time are key performance metrics. The results show that na\""ive
estimates of these quantities from simulation are highly likely to be
conservative.

June and July. A magnetic polarity reversal was observed relative to the

the tidal effects induced by the planet may be strong enough to force at least
the thin convective envelope into corotation. Tau Boo shows variability in the
Ca H & K and Halpha throughout the night and on a night to night time scale. We
do not detect enhancement in the activity of the star that may be related to
the conjunction of the planet. Further data is needed to conclude about the

functions for qubits and more generally for finite dimensional Hilbert spaces.
We look at this framework from a non-commutative space perspective and we focus
on the Moyal product and the differential calculus on the discrete phase
spaces. In particular, the qubit phase space provides the simplest example of a
four-point non-commutative phase space. We give an explicit expression of the
Moyal bracket as a differential operator. We then compare the quantum dynamics
encoded by the Moyal bracket to the classical dynamics: we show that the
classical Poisson bracket does not satisfy the Jacobi identity thus leaving the
Moyal bracket as the only consistent symplectic structure. We finally
generalizes our analysis to Hilbert spaces of prime dimensions d and their
associated d*d phase spaces.

diluting the net baryon to photon ratio to it's today observed value. A strong

locally compact space, a condenser being treated here as a countable, locally
finite collection of arbitrary sets with the sign +1 or -1 prescribed such that
the closures of opposite-signed sets are mutually disjoint. We are motivated by
the known fact that, in the noncompact case, the main minimum-problem of the
theory is in general unsolvable, and this occurs even under very natural
assumptions (e.g., for the Newtonian, Green, or Riesz kernels in an Euclidean
space and closed condensers of finitely many plates). Therefore it was
particularly interesting to find statements of variational problems dual to the
main minimum-problem (and hence providing some new equivalent definitions of
the capacity), but now always solvable (e.g., even for nonclosed, unbounded
condensers of infinitely many plates). For all positive definite kernels
satisfying B. Fuglede's condition of consistency between the strong and
weak-star topologies, problems with the desired properties are posed and
solved. Their solutions provide a natural generalization of the well-known
notion of interior capacitary distributions associated with a set. We give a
description of those solutions, establish statements on their uniqueness and
continuity, and point out their characteristic properties.

controllable dynamics, the landscape topology is trap-free, implying that any

specific constraints in the Hamiltonian corresponding to certain dynamical

are often used to identify and extract structure of interest. Perhaps
surprisingly, popular distribution-independent methods such as those based on
the VC dimension fail to provide nontrivial results for even simple learning
problems such as binary classification in these two settings. In this paper, we
develop distribution-dependent learning methods that can be used to provide
dimension-independent sample complexity bounds for the binary classification

sample complexity of maximum margin classifiers when the magnitude of the
entries in the feature vector decays according to a power law and also when
learning is performed with the so-called Diffusion Maps kernel. Both of these
results rely on bounding the annealed entropy of gap-tolerant classifiers in a
Hilbert space. We provide such a bound, and we demonstrate that our proof
technique generalizes to the case when the margin is measured with respect to
more general Banach space norms. The latter result is of potential interest in
cases where modeling the relationship between data elements as a dot product in
a Hilbert space is too restrictive.

the theory becomes general relativity (GR) at small scales. We show that at the

lensing potential and density perturbations is entirely unaffected by the extra

nonrelativistic motion that depends on space and time. We develop a resummation

analytic arguments that the Vainshtein mechanism does operate as anticipated,
with the density power spectrum approaching that of standard gravity within a
modified background evolution in the nonlinear regime. The transition is very
broad and there is no well defined Vainshtein scale, but roughly this
corresponds to k_*~ 2 at redshift z=1 and k_*~ 1 at z=0. We checked that while
extrinsic curvature fluctuations go nonlinear, and the dynamics of the
brane-bending mode C receives important nonlinear corrections, this mode does
get suppressed compared to density perturbations, effectively decoupling from
the standard gravity sector. At the same time, there is no violation of the
weak field limit for metric perturbations associated with C. We find good
agreement between our measurements and the predictions for the nonlinear power
spectrum presented in paper I, that rely on a renormalization of the linear

function of the mean synaptic weight, which predicts a first-order transition
and hysteresis between a noise-dominated regime and a regime of persistent
neural activity. Assuming Poisson firing statistics for the neurons, the
plasticity dynamics of a synapse under the influence of the mean-field

synaptic-weight space. Using a master-equation for small steps, we predict a
narrow distribution of synaptic weights that scales with the square root of the
plasticity rate for the stationary state of the system given plausible
physiological parameter values describing neural transmission and plasticity.
The dependence of the distribution on the synaptic weight of the mean-field
environment allows us to determine the mean synaptic weight self-consistently.

first-order transition for low number of afferent synapses per neuron and a
broadening of the synaptic weight distribution, respectively.

those excesses are due to annihilating dark matter (DM). In this paper we
calculate constraints on leptonically annihilating DM using observational data
on diffuse extragalactic gamma-ray background and measurements of the optical
depth to the last-scattering surface, and compare those with the PFH favored
region in the m_{DM} - <\sigma_A v> plane. Having specified the detailed form
of the energy input with PYTHIA Monte Carlo tools we solve the radiative
transfer equation which allows us to determine the amount of energy being
absorbed by the cosmic medium and also the amount left over for the diffuse
gamma background. We find that the constraints from the optical depth
measurements are able to rule out the PFH favored region fully for the
\tau^{-}+\tau^{+} annihilation channel and almost fully for the \mu^{-}+\mu^{+}
annihilation channel. It turns out that those constraints are quite robust with
almost no dependence on low redshift clustering boost. The constraints from the
gamma-ray background are sensitive to the assumed halo concentration model and,
for the power law model, rule out the PFH favored region for all leptonic
annihilation channels. We also find that it is possible to have models that
fully ionize the Universe at low redshifts. However, those models produce too
large free electron fractions at z > ~100 and are in conflict with the optical
depth measurements. Also, the magnitude of the annihilation cross-section in
those cases is larger than suggested by the PFH data.

structures, such as halos and their surrounding ionized regions in the IGM. We
combine, for the first time, N-body simulations, radiative transfer code, and
analytic calculations of luminosity of early structures to predict the angular
power spectrum (C_l) of fluctuations in the NIRB. We study the effects of
various assumptions about the stellar mass, the initial mass spectrum of stars,
metallicity, the star formation efficiency (f_*), the escape fraction of
ionizing photons (f_esc), and the star formation timescale (t_SF), on the
amplitude as well as the shape of C_l. The power spectrum of NIRB fluctuations
is maximized when f_* is the largest (as C_l ~ (f_*)^2) and f_esc is the
smallest. A significant uncertainty in the predicted amplitude of C_l exists
due to our lack of knowledge of t_SF of these galaxies, which is equivalent to
our lack of knowledge of the mass-to-light ratio. We do not see a turnover in
the NIRB angular power spectrum of the halo contribution and explain this as
the effect of high levels of non-linear bias. This is partly due to our choice
of the minimum mass of halos contributing to NIRB, and a smaller minimum mass,
which has a smaller non-linear bias, may still exhibit a turn over. Therefore,
both the amplitude and shape of the NIRB power spectrum provide important
information regarding the nature of sources contributing to the cosmic
reionization. The angular power spectrum of the IGM, in most cases, is much
smaller than the halo angular power spectrum. In addition, low levels of the
observed mean background intensity tend to rule out high values of f_* > 0.2.

the morphology-density relation up to z~1 and its dependence on galaxy
luminosity and stellar mass. The multi-wavelength coverage of the field also

a long history. We derive, in 4-D general relativity and in isotropic

framework for dynamical $\alpha$ (Bekenstein 1982). This solution coincides
with a previously known one-parameter extension of the dilatonic black hole
family. Among the notable properties of varying-$\alpha$ charged black holes
are adherence to a ``no hair'' principle, the absence of the inner (Cauchy)
horizon of the Reissner-Nordstrom black holes, the nonexistence of precisely
extremal black holes, and the appearance of naked singularities in an analytic
extension of the relevant metric. The exteriors of almost extremal electrically
(magnetically) charged black holes have simple structures which makes their
influence on applied magnetic (electric) fields transparent. We re-derive the
thermodynamic functions of the modified black holes; the otherwise difficult
calculation of the electric potential is done by a shortcut. We confirm that
variability of $\alpha$ in the wake of expansion of the universe does not

accretion flow around a spinning black hole is shown to exhibit hysteresis
effects. This confirms that a stationary shock is an integral part of such an
accretion disc in the Kerr metric. The equations describing the space gradient
of the dynamical flow velocity of the accreting matter have been shown to be
equivalent to a first order autonomous dynamical systems. Fixed point analysis
ensures that such flow must be multi-transonic for certain astrophysically
relevant initial boundary conditions. Contrary to the existing consensus in the
literature, the critical points and the sonic points are proved not to be
isomorphic in general. Homoclinic orbits for the flow flow possessing multiple
critical points select the critical point with the higher entropy accretion
rate, confirming that the entropy accretion rate is the degeneracy removing
agent in the system. However, heteroclinic orbits are also observed for some
special situation, where both the saddle type critical points of the flow
configuration possesses identical entropy accretion rate. Topologies with
heteroclinic orbits are thus the only allowed non removable degenerate
solutions for accretion flow with multiple critical points, and are shown to be
structurally unstable. Depending on suitable initial boundary conditions, a
homoclinic trajectory can be combined with a standard non homoclinic orbit
through an energy preserving Rankine-Hugoniot type of stationary shock. An
effective Lyapunov index has been proposed to analytically confirm why certain
class of transonic flow can not accommodate shock solutions even if it produces
multiple critical points. (Abridged)

introduction to spectral methods for linear and nonlinear dimension reduction,
emphasizing ways to overcome the computational limitations currently faced by
practitioners with massive datasets. In particular, a data subsampling or
landmark selection process is often employed to construct a kernel based on
partial information, followed by an approximate spectral analysis termed the
Nystrom extension. We provide a quantitative framework to analyse this
procedure, and use it to demonstrate algorithmic performance bounds on a range
of practical approaches designed to optimize the landmark selection process. We
compare the practical implications of these bounds by way of real-world
examples drawn from the field of computer vision, whereby low-dimensional
manifold structure is shown to emerge from high-dimensional video data streams.

(PNe) in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) from recent Australia Telescope Compact
Array+Parkes mosaic surveys. These detections were supplemented by new and high
resolution radio, optical and IR observations which helped to resolve the true
nature of the objects. Four of the PNe are located in the Small Magellanic
Cloud (SMC) and 11 are located in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Based on
Galactic PNe the expected radio flux densities at the distance of the LMC/SMC
are up to ~2.5 mJy and ~2.0 mJy at 1.4 GHz, respectively. We find that one of
our new radio PNe in the SMC has a flux density of 5.1 mJy at 1.4 GHz, several
times higher than expected. We suggest that the most luminous radio PN in the
SMC (N S68) may represent the upper limit to radio peak luminosity because it
is ~3 times more luminous than NGC 7027, the most luminous known Galactic PN.
We note that the optical diameters of these 15 MCs PNe vary from very small
(~0.08 pc or 0.32""; SMP L47) to very large (~1 pc or 4""; SMP L83). Their flux
densities peak at different frequencies, suggesting that they may be in
different stages of evolution. We briefly discuss mechanisms that may explain
their unusually high radio-continuum flux densities. We argue that these
detections may help solve the ""missing mass problem"" in PNe whose central stars
were originally 1-8 Msun. We explore the possible link between ionised halos
ejected by the central stars in their late evolution and extended radio
emission. Because of their higher than expected flux densities we tentatively
call this PNe (sub)sample - ""Super PNe"".

symmetry Z_n x Z_2^n, for which the sufficient conditions for asymptotic

  Firstly, we compute optimal conditions for asymptotic stability using
transition matrix techniques which make explicit use of the geometry of the
group action.
  Secondly, through an explicit computation of the global parts of the Poincare
map near the cycle we show that, generically, the resonance bifurcations from
the cycles are supercritical: a unique branch of asymptotically stable period
orbits emerges from the resonance bifurcation and exists for coefficient values
where the cycle has lost stability. This calculation is the first to explicitly
compute the criticality of a resonance bifurcation, and answers a conjecture of
Field and Swift in a particular limiting case. Moreover, we are able to obtain
an asymptotically-correct analytic expression for the period of the bifurcating
orbit, with no adjustable parameters, which has not proved possible previously.
We show that the asymptotic analysis compares very favourably with numerical
results.

this context selects a user (or users) to serve based on the current channel
state and user queues. Unless the user traffic is symmetric and/or the
underlying capacity region a polymatroid, little is known concerning how
performance optimal schedulers should tradeoff ""maximizing current service

user-diversity to enable future high service rate opportunities). By contrast
with currently proposed opportunistic schedulers, e.g., MaxWeight and Exp Rule,
a radial sum-rate monotone (RSM) scheduler de-emphasizes queue-balancing in
favor of greedily maximizing the system service rate as the queue-lengths are
scaled up linearly. In this paper it is shown that an RSM opportunistic
scheduler, p-Log Rule, is not only throughput-optimal, but also maximizes the
asymptotic exponential decay rate of the sum-queue distribution for a two-queue
system. The result complements existing optimality results for opportunistic
scheduling and point to RSM schedulers as a good design choice given the need
for robustness in wireless systems with both heterogeneity and high degree of

Aims. We attempt to detect whether Alfven waves are present in the polar
coronal holes through variations in EUV line widths. Methods. Using spectral
observations performed over a polar coronal hole region with the EIS
spectrometer on Hinode, we study the variation in the line width and electron
density as a function of height. We use the density sensitive line pairs of Fe
xii 186.88 A & 195.119 A and Fe xiii 203.82 A & 202.04 A . Results. For the
polar region, the line width data show that the nonthermal line-of-sight
velocity increases from 26 km/s at 1000 above the limb to 42 km/s some 15000
(i.e. 110,000 km) above the limb. The electron density shows a decrease from
3:3 10^9 cm^-3 to 1:9 10^8 cm^-3 over the same distance. Conclusions. These
results imply that the nonthermal velocity is inversely proportional to the
quadratic root of the electron density, in excellent agreement with what is
predicted for undamped radially propagating linear Alfven waves. Our data
provide signatures of Alfven waves in the polar coronal hole regions, which
could be important for the acceleration of the solar wind.

between MJD 51200 and 51450. The class shows unusual periodic-like variation in
count rate during rise time of two x-ray bursts. The class take place when the
source is in radio quiet state. The huge expansion in color-intensity diagram
indicates the class to be an adjusting stage of increasing accretion rate.
Spectral analysis shows that during lower count rate, the spectrum is hard
power-law dominating, indicating similarity towards hard intermediate state,
and during higher count rate, the spectrum is thermal disk blackbody component
dominating, indicating similarity towards high soft state. Hence, this class is
important in understanding the way of state transition leads to change in
accretion rate. No signature of any low frequency quasi periodic oscillation
was seen in this class. We also find that when the class was showing higher
counts, the average RMS amplitude is significantly high for high energy band
(14-60 keV) compared to low energy band (2-8 keV).

shown that the eavesdropper steals both transmitter and receiver antennas, and
the secret DMT depends on the remaining degrees of freedom. When CSI is
available at the transmitter (CSIT), the eavesdropper steals only transmitter
antennas. This dependence on the availability of CSI is unlike the DMT results
without secrecy constraints, where the DMT remains the same for no CSI and full

between readers and tags due to the limited range of the radio channel.
However, in real scenarios an intruder can be located between the prover (tag)
and the verifier (reader) and trick this last one into thinking that the prover
is in close proximity. This attack is generally known as a relay attack in
which scope distance fraud, mafia fraud and terrorist attacks are included.
Distance bounding protocols represent a promising countermeasure to hinder
relay attacks. Several protocols have been proposed during the last years but
vulnerabilities of major or minor relevance have been identified in most of
them. In 2008, Kim et al. [1] proposed a new distance bounding protocol with
the objective of being the best in terms of security, privacy, tag
computational overhead and fault tolerance. In this paper, we analyze this
protocol and we present a passive full disclosure attack, which allows an
adversary to discover the long-term secret key of the tag. The presented attack
is very relevant, since no security objectives are met in Kim et al.'s
protocol. Then, design guidelines are introduced with the aim of facilitating
protocol designers the stimulating task of designing secure and efficient
schemes against relay attacks. Finally a new protocol, named Hitomi and
inspired by [1], is designed conforming the guidelines proposed previously.

the star formation rate (SFR) of star-forming galaxies with their stellar mass
(M) and cosmic time (t), such that SFR is proportional to M x t^{-2.5}. It is
shown, that small systematic differences in SFR dramatically amplify in the
course of time: galaxies with above average SFR run into quasi-exponential mass
and SFR growth, while galaxies with below average SFR avoid such exponential
growth and evolve with moderate mass increase. It is argued that galaxies
following the first path would enormously overgrow if keeping to form stars all
the way to the present, hence should quench star formation and turn passive. By
the same token, those instead avoiding the quasi-exponential growth may keep to
form stars up to the present. Thus, it is conjectured that this divergent
behaviour can help understanding the origin of the dichotomy between passive,
spheroidal galaxies, and star-forming, disk galaxies.

do tomography, i.e. to infer medium properties from the in-medium modification

measured for some time, solid tomographic information is slow to emerge. This
can be traced back to theoretical uncertainties and ambiguities in modelling
both medium evolution and parton-medium interaction. Ways to overcome these
difficulties are to constrain models better and to focus on more differential
observables. Correlations of high P_T hadrons offer non-trivial information
beyond what can be deduced from single hadron suppression. They reflect not
only the hard reaction being modified by the medium, but also the back reaction
of the medium to the hard probe. Models for hard back-to-back correlations are
now very well constrained by a wealth of data and allow insights into the
nature of the parton-medium interaction as well as first true tomographic
results. Models of full in-medium jet evolution are being actively developed,

The cusp-core discrepancy is one of the major problems in
astrophysics. It results from comparing the observed mass distribution of
galaxies with the predictions of Cold Dark Matter simulations. The latter
predict a cuspy density profile in the inner parts of galaxies, whereas
observations of dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies show a constant
density core.
  Aims. We want to determine the shape of the dark matter potential in the
nuclear regions of a sample of six nearby irregular dwarf galaxies.
  Methods. In order to quantify the amount of non-circular motions which could
potentially affect a mass decomposition, we first perform a harmonic
decomposition of the HI Hermite velocity fields of all sample galaxies. We then
decompose the HI rotation curves into different mass components by fitting NFW
and pseudo-isothermal halo models to the HI rotation curves using a chi^2
minimisation. We model the minimum-disc, the minimum-disc+gas, and the
maximum-disc cases.
  Results. The non-circular motions are in all cases studied here of the order
of only a few km/s (generally corresponding to less than 25% of the local
rotation velocity), which means that they do not significantly affect the
rotation curves. The observed rotation curves can better be described by the
cored pseudo-isothermal halo than by the NFW halo. The slopes of the dark
matter density profiles confirm this result and are in good agreement with
previous studies. The quality of the fits can often be improved when including
the baryons, which suggests that they contribute significantly to the inner
part of the density profile of dwarf galaxies.

Here an ideal (without resistance), classical LC oscillating circuit with quick
switch ON-OFF alternation is considered. In the limit of the infinite series of
alternative short electrical current regime (switch in the ON state) and
no-current regime (current breaking by quick switch ON-OFF state alternation)
given LC circuit will never oscillate. Obviously, it represents a classical
electro-dynamical Zeno effect deeply analogous to quantum Zeno effect. All this

moderately strong coupling for RbOs2O6, and finally to extremely strong

Strong-coupling correction analyses of the superconducting properties reveal
that a low-energy rattling mode of the alkali metal ions is responsible for the
mechanism of the superconductivity in each compound. The large enhancement of
Tc from Cs to K is attributed to the increase in the electron-rattler coupling
with decreasing characteristic energy of the rattling and with increasing

pattern. The approximately equal hierarchies between successive generations,
the sizes of the mixing angles, the heaviness of just the top quark, and the
approximate down-lepton equality can all be accommodated by many flavor models
but can appear ad hoc. We present a simple, predictive mechanism to explain
these patterns. All generations are treated democratically and the flavor
symmetries are broken collectively by only two allowed couplings in
flavor-space, a vector and matrix, with arbitrary O(1) entries. Repeated use of
these flavor symmetry breaking spurions radiatively generates the Yukawa
couplings with a natural hierarchy. We demonstrate this idea with two models in
a split supersymmetric grand unified framework, with minimal additional
particle content at the unification scale. Although flavor is generated at the
GUT scale, there are several potentially testable predictions. In our minimal
model the usual prediction of exact b-tau unification is replaced by the SU(5)
breaking relation m_tau / m_b = 3 / 2, in better agreement with observations.
Other SU(5) breaking effects in the fermion masses can easily arise directly
from the flavor model itself. The symmetry breaking that triggers the
generation of flavor necessarily gives rise to an axion, solving the strong CP
problem. These theories contain long-lived particles whose decays could give
striking signatures at the LHC and may solve the primordial Lithium problems.
These models also give novel proton decay signatures which can be probed by the
next generation of experiments. Measurement of the various proton decay
channels directly probes the flavor symmetry breaking couplings. In this
scenario the Higgs mass is predicted to lie in a range near 150 GeV.

first studied by Gundersen and Steinbart in 1994. We have established a
previously unknown relation that the general solutions (\textit{i.e.}, whether
subnormal or not) of the DEs can be solved explicitly in terms of classical
special functions, namely the Bessel, Lommel and Struve functions, which are
important because of their numerous physical applications. In particular, we
show that the subnormal solutions are written explicitly in terms of the
degenerate Lommel functions $S_{\mu, \nu}(\zeta)$ and several classical special
polynomials related to the Bessel functions. In fact, we solve an equivalent
problem in special functions that each branch of the Lommel function $S_{\mu,
\nu}(\zeta)$ degenerates if and only if $S_{\mu, \nu}({\rm e}^z)$ has finite
order of growth in $\mathbf{C}$. We achieve this goal by proving new properties
and identities for these functions. A number of semi-classical
quantization-type results are obtained as consequences. Thus our results not
only recover and extend the result of Gundersen and Steinbart \cite{GS94}, but
the new identities and properties found for the Lommel functions are of
independent interest in a wider context.

enhancement in the vicinity. We propose that these haloes or enhancements are a
consequence of magnetic-field-induced mode mixing (scattering), resulting in
the preferential powering of waves that possess strong surface velocity
signatures (i.e. scattering from low to high wavenumbers). Evidently, this
process can occur in the reverse, and therefore in order to determine if the
haloes are indeed caused by mode mixing, we must answer the question: {\it how
are acoustic waves scattered by magnetic fields?} Through simulations of the
interactions between waves and sunspots and models of plage, we demonstrate
that the high to low modal order scattering channels are favoured. With
increasing frequency and consequently, decreasing wavelength, a growing number
of modes are scattered by the sunspot, thereby rendering the enhancements most
visible around the high-frequency parts of the spectrum. The haloes obtained
from the simulations are on the same order of magnitude but weaker than those
observed. We also present observational evidence to support this theory:
observations of active region AR9787 are firstly frequency filtered to isolate
the 5-6 mHz signals and secondly, decomposed into three wavenumber bandpasses,
$l - [0,400], [400,800], [800,2222]$. With increasing wavenumber, the extent of
the halo effect is seen increase dramatically, in line with theoretical
expectation.

in this problem when there is an underlying E_8 structure is the spectral
cover, which encodes all of the symmetries that fix the allowed couplings in
the superpotential, as well as the consistent, supersymmetric G-fluxes.
Imposing phenomenological requirements such as the existence of three
generations, top and bottom Yukawa couplings, good flavor structure and absence
of exotics and of a tree-level mu-term, we derive stringent constraints on the
allowed spectral covers. The resulting spectral covers are in conflict with the
neutrino scenarios that have been studied in local F-theory models unless we
allow for the possibility of additional charged fields, perhaps playing the
role of gauge messengers, that do not comprise complete GUT multiplets. Quite
remarkably, the existence of additional incomplete GUT multiplets below the GUT
scale is necessary for consistency with gauge coupling ""unification"", as their

evolution and spectra of protostellar clouds are described. The physical model
is based on a system of magneto-gasdynamical equations, including ohmic and
ambipolar diffusion, and a scheme for calculating the thermal and ionization
structure of a cloud. The dust and gas temperatures are determined during the
calculations of the thermal structure of the cloud. The results of computing
the dynamical and thermal structure of the cloud are used to model the
radiative transfer in continuum and in molecular lines. We presented the
results for clouds in hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium. The evolution of a
rotating magnetic protostellar cloud starting from a quasi-static state is also
considered. Spectral maps for optically thick lines of linear molecules are
analyzed. We have shown that the influence of the magnetic field and rotation
can lead to a redistribution of angular momentum in the cloud and the formation
of a characteristic rotational velocity structure. As a result, the
distribution of the velocity centroid of the molecular lines can acquire an
hourglass shape. We plan to use the developed program package together with a
model for the chemical evolution to interpret and model observed starless and
protostellar cores.

We suggest that some of the stellar kinematic groups in the solar neighborhood,

Galactic bar. A structure coincident with the Arcturus kinematic group is
developed when a hot stellar disk population is considered, which introduces a
new perspective on the interpretation of its extragalactic origin. A
bar-related resonant mechanism can modify this kinematic structure.We show that
particles in the dark matter disk-like structure predicted by recent LCDM
galaxy formation experiments, with similar kinematics to the thick disk, are
affected by the same resonances, developing phase space structures or dark
kinematic groups that are independent of the Galaxy assembly history and
substructure abundance. We discuss the possibility of using the stellar phase

in late-type stellar spectra. One of their modelling uncertainties is the
influence of convective flows on their shape. We aim to characterize the
influence of convection on the wings of Balmer lines. We perform a differential
comparison of synthetic Balmer line profiles obtained from 3D hydrodynamical
model atmospheres and 1D hydrostatic standard ones. The model parameters are
appropriate for F,G,K dwarf and subgiant stars of metallicity ranging from
solar to 1/1000 solar. The shape of the Balmer lines predicted by 3D models can
never be exactly reproduced by a 1D model, irrespective of its effective
temperature. We introduce the concept of a 3D temperature correction, as the
effective temperature difference between a 3D model and a 1D model which
provides the closest match to the 3D profile. The temperature correction is
different for the different members of the Balmer series and depends on the
adopted mixing-length parameter in the 1D model. Among the investigated models,
the 3D correction ranges from -300K to +300K. Horizontal temperature
fluctuations tend to reduce the 3D correction. Accurate effective temperatures
cannot be derived from the wings of Balmer lines, unless the effects of
convection are properly accounted for. The 3D models offer a physically well
justified way of doing so. The use of 1D models treating convection with the
mixing-length theory do not appear to be suitable for this purpose. In
particular, there are indications that it is not possible to determine a single
value of the mixing-length parameter which will optimally reproduce the Balmer
lines for any choice of atmospheric parameters.

outstanding problems in extragalactic astronomy. While we now have an idea for
how the merger fraction evolves at redshifts z < 3, converting this merger
fraction into merger rates, and therefore how many mergers an average galaxy
undergoes during its history, is still uncertain. The main reason for this is
that the inferred number of mergers depends highly upon the time-scale
observational methods are sensitive for finding ongoing or past mergers. While
there are several theoretical and model-based estimates of merger times, there
is currently no empirical measure of this time-scale. We present the first
observationally based measurement of merger times utilising the observed
decline in the galaxy major merger fraction at z < 1.2 based on > 20,000
galaxies in the Extended Groth Strip and COSMOS surveys. Using a new
methodology described in this paper, we determine how long a galaxy remains
identifiable as a merging system within the CAS system. We find a maximum CAS
major merger time-scale of 1.1+/-0.3 Gyr at z < 1.2, and a most likely CAS
merger time-scale of 0.6+/-0.3 Gyr, in good agreement with results from N-body
simulations. Utilizing this time-scale we measure the number of major mergers
galaxies with masses M_{*} > 10^{10} M_0 undergo at z < 1.2, with a total
number N_m = 0.90_{-0.23}^{+0.44}. We further show that this time-scale is
inconsistent with a star formation origin for ultra-high asymmetries, thereby
providing further evidence that structural methods are able to locate mostly
merging galaxies.

Moreover, they show a very small infrared excess in comparison with the other
sample stars. Methods: The different dust and gas species are identified on the
basis of high-resolution Spitzer-IRS spectra. We fit the full spectrum to
constrain grain sizes and temperature distributions in the discs. This,
combined with our broad-band spectral energy distribution and interferometric
measurements, allows us to study the physical structure of the disc, using a
self-consistent 2D radiative-transfer disc model. Results: We find that both
stars have strong emission features due to CO_2 gas, dominated by
^{12}C^{16}O_2, but with clear ^{13}C^{16}O_2 and even ^{16}O^{12}C^{18}O
isotopic signatures. Crystalline silicates are apparent in both sources but
proved very hard to model. EP Lyr also shows evidence of mixed chemistry, with
emission features of the rare class-C PAHs. Whether these PAHs reside in the
oxygen-rich disc or in a carbon-rich outflow is still unclear. With the
strongly processed silicates, the mixed chemistry and the low ^{12}C/^{13}C
ratio, EP Lyr resembles some silicate J-type stars, although the depleted
photosphere makes nucleosynthetic signatures difficult to probe. We find that
the disc environment of both sources is, to a first approximation, well
modelled with a passive disc, but additional physics such as grain settling,
radial dust distributions, and an outflow component must be included to explain

coupled-cavity microlasers, featuring bistability between modes separated by
several nanometers. A numerical implementation is demonstrated by simulating a
two-dimensional photonic crystal microlaser. Switching times of less than 10
ps, switching energy around 15--30 fJ and on-off contrast of more than 40 dB
are achieved. Theoretical guidelines for optimizing the performance of the
memory cell in terms of switching time and energy are drawn.

ultracold neutral plasmas. We focus on the earliest times, when the plasma
equilibrium is evolving and before the plasma expands. In the simulation, the
ions interact via the Yukawa potential in a small cell with wrapped boundary
conditions. We solve the optical Bloch equation for each ion in the simulation
as a function of time. Both the simulation and experiment show the initial
Bloch vector rotation, disorder-induced heating, and coherent oscillation of
the rms ion velocity. Detailed modeling of the fluorescence signal makes it
possible to use fluorescence spectroscopy to probe ion dynamics in ultracold
and strongly coupled plasmas.

and universal graphical calculus for multi-qubit systems, the ZX-calculus,
which greatly simplifies derivations in the area of quantum computation and
information. (ii) To axiomatise complementarity of quantum observables within a
general framework for physical theories in terms of dagger symmetric monoidal
categories. We also axiomatize phase shifts within this framework.
  Using the well-studied canonical correspondence between graphical calculi and
symmetric monoidal categories, our results provide a purely graphical
formalisation of complementarity for quantum observables. Each individual
observable, represented by a commutative special dagger Frobenius algebra,
gives rise to an abelian group of phase shifts, which we call the phase group.
We also identify a strong form of complementarity, satisfied by the Z and X
spin observables, which yields a scaled variant of a bialgebra.
