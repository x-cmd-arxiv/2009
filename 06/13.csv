using the All Sky Automated Survey (ASAS) data. The sample covers 75% of the
sky and contains objects in the close neighbourhood of the Sun, within 4 kpc
distance. Unlike in the previous analysis of the close field RRab, we see a
clear manifestation of the Oosterhoff groups on the period - amplitude diagram.
The relation for Oosterhoff I type variables becomes strongly flattened at
large V amplitudes, which was not observed for globular cluster RR Lyrae. We
calculate photometric metallicities using two available methods: one of Jurcsik
& Kovacs (1996) and the other of Sandage (2004). We find significant
discrepancies between results from both methods. Comparison with spectroscopic
metallicities undoubtedly favors the method of Jurcsik & Kovacs (1996). In
addition, we notice that RRab of Oosterhoff II type might follow a different
metallicity-period-phase relation than Oosterhoff I type variables. The spatial
distribution of Galactic field RRab does not show any metallicity gradients
with distance from the Galactic Center in either of the Oosterhoff groups.
However, both the older, metal poor Oosterhoff II variables and the metal rich
Oosterhoff I RRab become more concentrated to the Galactic plane with
increasing metal content.

visible F-star primary and an unseen M-star secondary (M_A > 0.8 M_sun, M_B <
0.45 M_sun). The spectroscopic orbital solution combined with a high precision
transit light curve for each system gives sufficient information to calculate
the density of the primary star and the surface gravity of the secondary. The
masses of the primary stars were obtained using stellar evolution models. The
solutions were compared with results obtained by calculating the radius of the
primary stars under the assumption of rotational synchronization with the
orbital period and alignment between their spin axis and the axis of the orbit.
Four systems show an acceptable match between the two sets of results, but one
system shows a clear mismatch between the two solutions, which may indicate the
absence of synchronization or a misalignment between the rotational and orbital
axis. When compared to low-mass stellar evolution models, the derived masses
and radii of the unseen M dwarfs are inconsistent (three only marginally) with
the predicted values, with all of the radii being larger than expected for
their masses. These results confirm the discrepancy shown in previous work
between the predicted and observed radii on low-mass binary stars. This work
also shows that reliance on the assumption of synchronization to derive the
mass and radius of stars in eclipsing single--lined F+M binaries is a useful
tool, but may not always be warranted and should be carefully tested against
stellar evolution models.

as an important starting point in the formation of more complex species.
Previous laboratory measurements by two groups on the hydrogenation of CO ices
resulted in controversial results on the formation rate of methanol. Our aim is
to resolve this controversy by an independent investigation of the reaction
scheme for a range of H-atom fluxes and different ice temperatures and
thicknesses. Reaction rates are determined by using a state-of-the-art ultra
high vacuum experimental setup to bombard an interstellar CO ice analog with
room temperature H atoms. The reaction of CO + H into H2CO and subsequently
CH3OH is monitored by a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer in a reflection
absorption mode. In addition, after each completed measurement a temperature
programmed desorption experiment is performed to identify the produced species.
Different H-atom fluxes, morphologies, and ice thicknesses are tested. The
formation of both formaldehyde and methanol via CO hydrogenation is confirmed
at low temperature (12-20 K). We confirm, as proposed by Hidaka et al., that
the discrepancy between the two Japanese studies is mainly due to a difference
in the applied hydrogen atom flux. The production rate of formaldehyde is found
to decrease and the penetration column to increase with temperature. In order
to fully understand the laboratory data, the experimental results are
interpreted using Monte Carlo simulations. This technique takes into account
the layered structure of CO ice. Temperature-dependent reaction barriers and
diffusion rates are inferred using this model. The model is extended to
interstellar conditions to compare with observational H2CO/CH3OH data.

both models that use the Press-Schechter (PS) and Sheth-Tormen (ST) halo mass
functions to calculate the abundances of dark matter halos. The Lyman-alpha
luminosity functions at z < 4 are well reproduced with only <10% of the LBGs
emitting Lyman-alpha lines with rest equivalent width greater than the limiting
equivalent width of the narrow band surveys. However, the observed luminosity
function at z > 5 can be reproduced only when we assume that nearly all LBGs
are Lyman-alpha emitters. Thus it appears that 4 < z < 5 marks the epoch when a
clear change occurs in the physical properties of the high redshift galaxies.
As Lyman-alpha escape depends on dust and gas kinematics of the inter stellar
medium (ISM), this could mean that on an average the ISM at z > 5 could be less
dusty, more clumpy and having more complex velocity field. All of these will
enable easier escape of the Lyman-alpha photons. At z > 5 the observed
Lyman-alpha luminosity function are well reproduced with the evolution in the
halo mass function along with very minor evolution in the physical properties
of high redshift galaxies. In particular, upto z = 6.5, we do not see the
effect of evolving inter galactic medium (IGM) opacity on the Lyman-alpha
escape from these galaxies.

deformed M2-brane theory. At weak coupling, the BPS vortices preserving six

symmetry is broken to U(1) x U(1). The classical vortex solitons break a
colour-flavour locked global symmetry resulting in non-Abelian internal
orientational moduli and a CP^1 moduli space of solutions. At strong coupling
and large k, upon reduction to type IIA strings, the vortex moduli space and
its action are computed by a probe D0-brane in the dual geometry. The mass of
the D0-brane matches the classical vortex mass. However, the gravity picture
exhibits a six dimensional moduli space of solutions, a section of which can be
identified as the CP^1 we find classically, along with a Dirac monopole
connection of strength k. It is likely that the extra four dimensions in the
moduli space are an artifact of the strong coupling limit and of the

using analytic techniques. In its linear regime, angular momentum transport in
MHD turbulent accretion flow involves the generation of radial magnetic field
connecting plasma in a differentially rotating flow. We take a first principles
approach, highlighting the constraint that limits the generation and
amplification of radial magnetic fields, stemming from the transfer of energy
from mechanical to magnetic form. Because the energy transferred in magnetic
form is ultimately constrained by gravitational potential energy or Killing
energy, the spin-dependence of the latter allows us to derive spin-dependent
constraints on the success of the accreting plasma to expel its angular
momentum and accrete. We find an inverse relationship between this ability and
black hole spin. If this radial magnetic field generation forms the basis for

applying a potential that has a shallow pocket in the entrance channel. Thus
the observed $S$ factor for fusion, which develops a maximum at low energy, can
be reproduced fairly well. The high-energy data can also be accounted for but
that requires the use of a weak, short-ranged imaginary potential that absorbs
the incoming flux near the location of the minimum of the potential pocket.
Predictions of the fusion hindrance in other Ca+Zr systems are made and are

but with tentative evidence for additional processes contributing to core
enrichment in hotter groups. Inferred metal mass-to-light ratios inside r_500
show a positive correlation with total group mass but are generally
significantly lower than in clusters, due to a combination of lower global ICM
abundances and gas-to-light ratios in groups. This metal deficiency is present
for products from both SN Ia and SN II, and suggests that metals were either
synthesized, released from galaxies, or retained within the ICM less
efficiently in lower-mass systems. We explore possible causes, including
variations in galaxy formation and metal release efficiency, cooling-out of
metals, and gas and metal loss via AGN- or starburst-driven galactic winds from
groups or their precursor filaments. Loss of enriched material from filaments
coupled with post-collapse AGN feedback emerge as viable explanations, but we
also find evidence for metals to have been released less efficiently from
galaxies in cooler groups and for the ICM in these to appear chemically less
evolved, possibly reflecting more extended star formation histories in less
massive systems. Some implications for the hierarchical growth of clusters from

young, rapidly rotating stars indicate that many possess substantial magnetic
activity and strong axisymmetric magnetic fields. We conduct simulations of
dynamo action in rapidly rotating suns with the 3-D MHD anelastic spherical
harmonic (ASH) code to explore the complex coupling between rotation,
convection and magnetism. Here we study dynamo action realized in the bulk of
the convection zone for two systems, rotating at three and five times the
current solar rate. We find that substantial organized global-scale magnetic
fields are achieved by dynamo action in these systems. Striking wreathes of
magnetism are built in the midst of the convection zone, coexisting with the
turbulent convection. This is a great surprise, for many solar dynamo theories
have suggested that a tachocline of penetration and shear at the base of the
convection zone is a crucial ingredient for organized dynamo action, whereas
these simulations do not include such tachoclines. Some dynamos achieved in
these rapidly rotating states build persistent global-scale fields which
maintain amplitude and polarity for thousands of days. In the case at five
times the solar rate, the dynamo can undergo cycles of activity, with fields
varying in strength and even changing polarity. As the magnetic fields wax and
wane in strength, the primary response in the convective flows involves the
axisymmetric differential rotation, which begins to vary on similar time
scales. Bands of relatively fast and slow fluid propagate toward the poles on
time scales of roughly 500 days. In the Sun, similar patterns are observed in
the poleward branch of the torsional oscillations, and these may represent a
response to poleward propagating magnetic field deep below the solar surface.

the upper kinematical endpoints of the individual distributions m_{jll},
m_{jl(lo)} and m_{jl(hi)}, all three of which suffer from parameter space
region ambiguities and may lead to multiple solutions for the SUSY mass
spectrum. In contrast, we do not use m_{jll}, m_{jl(lo)} and m_{jl(hi)}, and
instead propose a new set of (infinitely many) variables whose upper kinematic
endpoints exhibit reduced sensitivity to the parameter space region. We then
outline an alternative, much simplified procedure for obtaining the SUSY mass
spectrum. In particular, we show that the four endpoints observed in the three
distributions m^2_{ll}, m^2_{jln} U m^2_{jlf} and m^2_{jln}+m^2_{jlf} are
sufficient to completely pin down the squark mass and the two neutralino
masses, leaving only a discrete 2-fold ambiguity for the slepton mass. This
remaining ambiguity can be easily resolved in a number of different ways: for
example, by a single additional measurement of the kinematic endpoint of any
one out of the many remaining 1-dimensional distributions at our disposal, or
by exploring the correlations in the 2-dimensional distribution of m^2_{jln} U
m^2_{jlf} versus m^2_{ll}. We illustrate our method with two examples: the LM1

improvement in the accuracy of the SUSY mass determination, due to the

constraining the angular momentum evolution of young stellar objects (YSO). Of
particular interest are the very low mass (VLM) stars and brown dwarfs (BDs),
because of the significant lack of known rotational periods in that mass range.
We provide for the first time information on rotational periods for a large
sample of young VLM stars and BDs. This extensive rotational period study in
the 1 Myr old Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) is based on a deep photometric
monitoring campaign using the Wide Field Imager (WFI) camera on the ESO/MPG
2.2m telescope on La Silla, Chile. Accurate I-band photometry of 2908 stars was
obtained, extending three magnitudes deeper than previous studies in the ONC.
We found 487 periodic variables with estimated masses between 0.5 Msun and
0.015 Msun, 124 of which are BD candidates. This is by far the most extensive
and complete rotational period data set for young VLM stars and BDs. In
addition, 808 objects show non-periodic brightness variations. We study the
dependence of the period distribution on mass and variability level and compare
this with known higher mass objects in the ONC (Herbst et al. 2002) and with
the 2 Myr old cluster NGC 2264 (Lamm et al., 2004). We find that substellar
objects rotate on average faster than the VLM stars. Our rotational data also
suggest a dependence of the rotational periods on position within the field,
which can be explained by a possible age spread in the ONC. In addition,
periodic variables with larger peak-to-peak amplitudes rotate on average slower
than those with small peak-to-peak amplitude variations, which can possibly be
explained by different magnetic field topologies.

compact convex set in a complex Euclidean space C^n to a certain complex
manifold Y is a uniform limit of entire maps of C^n to Y, then Y enjoys the
parametric Oka property. In particular, for any reduced Stein space X the
inclusion of the space of holomorphic maps of X to Y into the space of
continuous maps is a weak homotopy equivalence. This shows that all Oka type
properties of a complex manifold are equivalent to each other. (See also the

for the Landau-Lifshitz Navier-Stokes (LLNS) equations and related stochastic
partial differential equations in fluid dynamics. The LLNS equations
incorporate thermal fluctuations into macroscopic hydrodynamics by the addition
of white-noise fluxes whose magnitudes are set by a fluctuation-dissipation
relation. Originally derived for equilibrium fluctuations, the LLNS equations
have also been shown to be accurate for non-equilibrium systems. Previous
studies of numerical methods for the LLNS equations focused primarily on
measuring variances and correlations computed at equilibrium and for selected
non-equilibrium flows. In this paper, we introduce a more systematic approach
based on studying discrete equilibrium structure factors for a broad class of
explicit linear finite-volume schemes. This new approach provides a better
characterization of the accuracy of a spatio-temporal discretization as a
function of wavenumber and frequency, allowing us to distinguish between
behavior at long wavelengths, where accuracy is a prime concern, and short
wavelengths, where stability concerns are of greater importance. We use this
analysis to develop a specialized third-order Runge Kutta scheme that minimizes
the temporal integration error in the discrete structure factor at long
wavelengths for the one-dimensional linearized LLNS equations. Together with a
novel method for discretizing the stochastic stress tensor in dimension larger
than one, our improved temporal integrator yields a scheme for the
three-dimensional equations that satisfies a discrete fluctuation-dissipation
balance for small time steps and is also sufficiently accurate even for time
steps close to the stability limit.

representation of nuclear force interactions embedded within pycnonuclear
reaction processes. The study then extends the methodology to incorporate
distinctive theoretical characteristics of strange quark matter nuggets, like
their low charge-per-baryon ratio, and then assesses their effects on the
pycnonuclear reaction rates. Particular emphasis is put on the impact of color
superconductivity on the reaction rates. Depending on whether or not quark
nuggets are in this novel state of matter, their electric charge properties
vary drastically which turns out to have a dramatic effect on the pycnonuclear
reaction rates. Future nuclear fusion network calculations may thus have the
potential to shed light on the existence of strange quark matter nuggets and on
whether or not they are in a color superconducting state, as suggested by QCD.

luminous source IRS 1 is a class I protostar. IRS 1 is believed to be driving a
powerful bipolar molecular outflow and may be an embedded B-type star or its
progenitor. Its X-ray spectrum reveals a fluorescent Fe emission line at 6.4
keV, arising in cold material near the protostar. The line is present even in
the absence of large flares, raising questions about the nature of the ionizing
mechanism responsible for producing the 6.4 keV fluorescent line. Chandra also
detects X-ray sources at or near the positions of IRS 2, IRS 3, IRS 4, and IRS

  Functions",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Logconcave functions represent the current frontier of efficient algorithms
for sampling, optimization and integration in R^n. Efficient sampling
algorithms to sample according to a probability density (to which the other two
problems can be reduced) relies on good isoperimetry which is known to hold for
arbitrary logconcave densities. In this paper, we extend this frontier in two
ways: first, we characterize convexity-like conditions that imply good
isoperimetry, i.e., what condition on function values along every line
guarantees good isoperimetry? The answer turns out to be the set of
(1/(n-1))-harmonic concave functions in R^n; we also prove that this is the
best possible characterization along every line, of functions having good
isoperimetry. Next, we give the first efficient algorithm for sampling
according to such functions with complexity depending on a smoothness
parameter. Further, noting that the multivariate Cauchy density is an important
distribution in this class, we exploit certain properties of the Cauchy density
to give an efficient sampling algorithm based on random walks with a mixing
time that matches the current best bounds known for sampling logconcave
functions.

self-consistently combined Fokker-Planck modeling of particles and hydrodynamic

unified code of acceleration, transport, and radiation, while plasma is modeled

the particle transport code, which is more accurate than those based on
approximate analytical solutions. We used a realistic spectrum of injected
electrons provided by the stochastic acceleration model, which has a smooth
transition from a quasi-thermal background at low energies to a nonthermal tail
at high energies. The inclusion of low-energy electrons results in relatively
more heating in the corona (vs. chromosphere), a larger downward conductive
flux, and thus a stronger chromospheric evaporation than obtained in previous
studies, which had a deficit in low-energy electrons due to an arbitrarily
assumed low-energy cutoff. The energy and spatial distributions of energetic
electrons and bremsstrahlung photons bear signatures of the changing density
distribution caused by chromospheric evaporation. In particular, the density
jump at the evaporation front gives rise to enhanced X-ray emission.

because of the observed correlation between the effective radius $R_{eff}$ and
the total stellar mass $M_{\star}$. When expressed in logarithmic units, a
linear relation, $\log{R_{eff}} \propto \gamma \log{M_{\star}}$, is indeed
observationally found, but the slope $\gamma$ deviates from the canonical
$\gamma = 1/2$ value which can be naively predicted for a spherically symmetric
isotropic system. We propose here that a transfer of angular momentum to the
stellar component induces an anisotropy in the velocity space thus leading to a
modified distribution function (DF). Assuming an Osipkov - Merritt like
anisotropic DF, we derive an analytic relation between the slope $\gamma$ of
the size - mass relation and the slope $\alpha$ of the angular momentum term in
the DF. With this simple model, we are then able to recover the observed
$\gamma$ value provided $\alpha$ is suitably set. It turns out that an
anisotropy profile which is tangential inside $\sim 0.6 r_a$ and radial
outside, with $r_a$ the anisotropy radius, is able to reproduce the observed
size - mass relation observed for massive ($M_{\star} \ge 2 \times 10^{10} \

Warping (DTW) distance has been recognized as one of the most accurate and
suitable distance measures due to its flexibility in sequence alignment.
However, DTW distance calculation is computationally intensive. Especially in
very large time series databases, sequential scan through the entire database
is definitely impractical, even with random access that exploits some index
structures since high dimensionality of time series data incurs extremely high
I/O cost. More specifically, a sequential structure consumes high CPU but low
I/O costs, while an index structure requires low CPU but high I/O costs. In
this work, we therefore propose a novel indexed sequential structure called
TWIST (Time Warping in Indexed Sequential sTructure) which benefits from both
sequential access and index structure. When a query sequence is issued, TWIST
calculates lower bounding distances between a group of candidate sequences and
the query sequence, and then identifies the data access order in advance, hence
reducing a great number of both sequential and random accesses. Impressively,
our indexed sequential structure achieves significant speedup in a querying
process by a few orders of magnitude. In addition, our method shows superiority
over existing rival methods in terms of query processing time, number of page
accesses, and storage requirement with no false dismissal guaranteed.

efficient truthful mechanisms that approximate the optimal social welfare. A
fundamental question is whether an \alpha-approximation algorithm translates
into an \alpha-approximate truthful mechanism. It is well-known that plugging
an \alpha-approximation algorithm into the VCG technique may not yield a
truthful mechanism. Thus, it is natural to investigate properties of
approximation algorithms that enable their use in truthful mechanisms.
  The main contribution of this paper is to identify a useful and natural
property of approximation algorithms, which we call loser-independence; this
property is applicable in the single-minded and single-parameter settings.
Intuitively, a loser-independent algorithm does not change its outcome when the
bid of a losing agent increases, unless that agent becomes a winner. We
demonstrate that loser-independent algorithms can be employed as sub-procedures
in a greedy iterative packing approach while preserving monotonicity. A greedy
iterative approach provides a good approximation in the context of maximizing a
non-decreasing submodular function subject to independence constraints. Our
framework gives rise to truthful approximation mechanisms for various problems.
Notably, some problems arise in online mechanism design.

framework of quark combination model is investigated, taking $f_0(980)$ as an
example. The production rate and $p_T$ spectra of $f_0(980)$ considered as
$(s\bar s)$ or $(s\bar q\bar s q)$ respectively, are calculated and compared in
Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200GeV$. The unitarity of various
combination models, when open for exotic hadron production, is addressed.

Analyses of pre-switching thermal fluctuations allow detailed measurements of
coherence times and variations in magnetization precession amplitude. We find
that with a small in-plane hard-axis magnetic field the magnetization dynamics
are more spatially coherent than for the case of zero field.

the HERA 27.6 GeV lepton beam was scattered off several nuclear gas targets.
The average squared transverse momentum was clearly observed to increase with

projective plane at three non-colliear points. The main result in this paper is
that the category of quasi-coherent sheaves on B_3 is equivalent to the
quotient of the category of graded R-modules modulo the full subcategory of
modules M such that for each m in M, $(x,y)^nm=0$ for n sufficiently large.
This is proved by showing the R is a twisted homogeneous coordinate ring (in
the sense of Artin and Van den Bergh) for B_3. This reduces almost all
representation-theoretic questions about R to algebraic geometric questions
about the del Pezzo surface B_3. For example, the generic simple R-module has
dimension six. Furthermore, the main result combined with results of Artin,
Tate, and Van den Bergh, imply that R is a noetherian domain of global
dimension three, and has other good homological properties.

the problems of light polarization optics in the frames of vector
Stokes-Mueller and spinor Jones formalism. In view of great differences between
properties of isotropic and time-like vectors in Special Relativity we should
expect principal differences in describing completely polarized and partly
polarized light. In particular, substantial differences are revealed when
turning to spinor techniques in the context of the polarized light. Because
Jones complex formalism has close relation to spinor objects of the Lorentz
group, within the field of the light polarization we could have physical
realizations on the optical desk of some subtle topological distinctions
between orthogonal L_{+}^{\uparrow} =SO_{0}(3.1) and spinor SL(2.C) groups.

that assign risks to individuals, using their personal covariates. We need to
evaluate these models, and to quantify the gains achieved by expanding a model
with additional covariates. We describe several performance measures for risk
models, and show how they are related. Application of the measures to risk
models for hypothetical populations and for postmenopausal US women illustrate
several points. First, model performance is constrained by the distribution of
true risks in the population. This complicates the comparison of two models if
they are applied to populations with different covariate distributions. Second,
the Brier Score and the Integrated Discrimination Improvement (IDI) are more
useful than the concordance statistic for quantifying precision gains obtained
from model expansion. Finally, these precision gains are apt to be small,
although they may be large for some individuals. We propose a new way to
identify these individuals, and show how to quantify how much they gain by
measuring the additional covariates. Those with largest gains could be targeted
for cost-efficient covariate assessment.

equipment can be compared to building sports cars, task-oriented, focused and
fast. However, unlike track-bound sports cars, ultra-fast and purpose-built
silicon yields better energy efficiency when compared to more generic family
sedan designs that mitigate go-to-market risks by being the masters of many
tasks. Thus, we demonstrate that the best opportunities for power savings come
via protocol simplification, best-of-breed technology, and silicon and software
optimization, to achieve the least amount of processing necessary to move
packets. We also look to the future of networking from a new angle, where
energy efficiency and environmental concerns are viewed as fundamental design
criteria and forces that need to be harnessed to continually create more
powerful networking equipment.
