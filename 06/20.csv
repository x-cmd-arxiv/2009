z=0.36 galaxy COSMOS J100043.15+020637.2. COSMOS Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
imaging of the galaxy shows a tidal tail, indicating that the galaxy recently
underwent a merger, as well as two bright point sources near the galaxy's
center. Both the luminosities of these sources (derived from the HST image) and
their emission line flux ratios (derived from Keck/DEIMOS slit spectroscopy)
suggest that both are AGN and not star-forming regions or supernovae.
Observations from zCOSMOS, Sloan Digital Sky Survey, XMM-Newton, Very Large
Array, and Spitzer fortify the evidence for AGN activity. With HST imaging we
measure a projected spatial offset between the two AGN of 1.75 +- 0.03 kpc/h,
and with DEIMOS we measure a 150 +- 40 km/s line-of-sight velocity offset
between the two AGN. Combined, these observations provide substantial evidence
that COSMOS J100043.15+020637.2 is a dual AGN in a merger-remnant galaxy.

spinor (PS) superstring theories, with the nilpotent pure spinor BRST charge
$Q_{PS}=\oint{\lambda^\alpha}d_\alpha$ still retaining its form but with
singular operator products between commuting spinor variables $\lambda^\alpha$.
Despite the OPE singularities, the pure spinor condition
$\lambda\gamma^m\lambda=0$ is still fulfilled in a weak sense, explained in the
paper. The operator product singularities correspond to introducing
interactions between the pure spinors. We conjecture that the leading
singularity orders of the OPE between two interacting pure spinors is related
to the ghost number of the corresponding BRST operator in RNS formalism.
Namely, it is conjectured that the BRST operators of minimal superconformal
ghost numbers $n=1,2,3...$ can be mapped to nilpotent BRST operators in the
deformed pure spinor formalism with the OPE of two commuting spinors having a
leading singularity order $\lambda(z)\lambda(w)\sim{O}(z-w)^{-2(n^2+6n+1)}$.

peculiar structure and no finite-size corrections to the energy per site. We
find that such model corresponds to a special point on the $\Delta$-axis which
separates the region where adding spin-pairs increases the energy per site from
that where the longer the chain the lower the energy. Entanglement properties
do not hold surprises for $\Delta=1/2$ and $N$ odd. Finite-size corrections to
the energy per site non trivially vanish also in the ferromagnetic $\Delta\to

features of some entanglement properties, due to the finite length of the chain
and related with the change in the symmetry of the Hamiltonian, are evidenced
and discussed. In both the above models the absence of finite-size corrections
to the energy per site is related to a peculiar structure of the ground state,

Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt. However, a rare subset show hot excess from within a few
AU, which is often inferred to be transient. We examine 2 such sources to place
limits on their location to help distinguish between different interpretations
for their origin. We use MIDI on the VLTI to observe the debris discs around
eta Corvi and HD69830 using baseline lengths from 44-130m. New VISIR
observations of HD69830 at 18.7um are also presented. These observations are
compared with disc models to place limits on disc size. The visibility
functions measured with MIDI for both sources show significant variation with
wavelength across 8-13um in a manner consistent with the disc flux being well
resolved, notably with a dip at 10-11.5um due to the silicate emission feature.
The average ratio of visibilities measured between 10-11.5um and 8-9um is
0.934+/-0.015 for HD69830 and 0.880+/-0.013 for eta Corvi over the 4 baselines
for each source, a departure of 4 and 9sigma from that expected if the discs
were unresolved. HD69830 is unresolved by VISIR at 18.7um. The combined limits
from MIDI and 8m imaging constrain the warm dust to lie within 0.05-2.4AU for
HD69830 and 0.16-2.98AU for eta Corvi. These results represent the first
resolution in the mid-IR of dust around main sequence stars. The constraints
placed on the location of the dust are consistent with radii predicted by SED
modelling. Tentative evidence for a common position angle for the dust at 1.7AU
with that at 150AU around eta Corvi, which might be expected if the hot dust is
fed from the outer disc, demonstrates the potential of this technique for
constraining the origin of the dust and more generally for the study of dust in
the terrestrial regions of main sequence stars.

bear on Planck scale phenomenology and we discuss the possible implications for
the alternative scenarios for in-vacua dispersion coming from breaking or
deforming of Poincare invariance. Among these are semi-conservative bounds,
which rely on some relatively weak assumptions about the sources, on subluminal
and superluminal in-vacuo dispersion. We also propose that it may be possible
to look for the arrival of still higher energy photons and neutrinos from GRB's

dispersion effect would predict these arrivals to be delayed or advanced by

and the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) in the framework of the
full-potential linear augmented plane waves (FLAPW) method. Wannier-like
functions for the correlated shell are constructed by projecting local orbitals
onto a set of Bloch eigenstates located within a certain energy window. The
screened Coulomb interaction and Hund's coupling are calculated from a
first-principle constrained RPA scheme. We apply this LDA+DMFT implementation,
in conjunction with continuous-time quantum Monte-Carlo, to study the
electronic correlations in LaFeAsO. Our findings support the physical picture
of a metal with intermediate correlations. The average value of the mass
renormalization of the Fe 3d bands is about 1.6, in reasonable agreement with
the picture inferred from photoemission experiments. The discrepancies between
different LDA+DMFT calculations (all technically correct) which have been
reported in the literature are shown to have two causes: i) the specific value
of the interaction parameters used in these calculations and ii) the degree of
localization of the Wannier orbitals chosen to represent the Fe 3d states, to
which many-body terms are applied. The latter is a fundamental issue in the
application of many-body calculations, such as DMFT, in a realistic setting. We
provide strong evidence that the DMFT approximation is more accurate and more
straightforward to implement when well-localized orbitals are constructed from
a large energy window encompassing Fe-3d, As-4p and O-2p, and point out several
difficulties associated with the use of extended Wannier functions associated
with the low-energy iron bands. Some of these issues have important physical
consequences, regarding in particular the sensitivity to the Hund's coupling.

efficiencies due to radiation from AGN in relatively large scale outflows. Our
measurements are based on the axisymmetric and time-dependent
radiation-hydrodynamical simulations recently presented in Kurosawa & Proga.
These simulations follow dynamics of gas under the influences of the AGN
radiation and the gravity of the central 10^8 Msun black hole on scales from
~0.01 to ~10pc. We compare our Mdot_a-rho_o relation with that predicted by the
Bondi accretion model. For high luminosities comparable to the Eddington limit,
the power-law fit (Mdot_a ~ rho_o^q) to our models yields q=~0.5 instead of
q=1.0 which is predicted by the Bondi model. This difference is caused by the
outflows which are important for the overall mass budget at high luminosities.
The maximum momentum and mass feedback efficiencies found in our models are
~10^-2 and ~10^-1, respectively. However, the outflows are much less important
energetically: their thermal and kinetic powers in units of the radiative
luminosity are ~10^-5 and ~10^-4, respectively. The efficiencies do not
increase monotonically with the accretion luminosity but rather peak around the
Eddington limit beyond which a steady state disk-wind-like solution exists. Our
energy feedback efficiencies are significantly lower than 0.05, which is
required in some cosmological and galaxy merger simulations. The low feedback
efficiencies found here could have significant implications on the mass growth
of super massive black holes in the early universe. We stress however that we
have not considered the innermost parts of the accretion and outflow where
radiation and matter interact most strongly. The feedback from this region
could have efficiencies significantly above the low values found here.

0.1%, and the dark energy parameters w_0 and w_a to ~0.01 and 0.1,resp. BBO's
dark-energy figure-of-merit would be approximately an order of magnitude better
than all other proposed dark energy missions. To date, BBO has been designed
with the primary goal of searching for gravitational waves from inflation. To
observe this inflationary background, BBO would first have to detect and
subtract out ~300,000 merging compact-star binaries, out to z~5. It is
precisely this foreground which would enable high-precision cosmology. BBO
would determine the luminosity distance to each binary to ~percent accuracy.
BBO's angular resolution would be sufficient to uniquely identify the host
galaxy for most binaries; a coordinated optical/infrared observing campaign
could obtain the redshifts. Combining the GW-derived distances and EM-derived
redshifts for such a large sample of objects leads to extraordinarily tight
constraints on cosmological parameters. Such ``standard siren'' measurements of
cosmology avoid many of the systematic errors associated with other techniques.

the plausibility of detecting an LHB-like process in extrasolar systems. Recent
surveys have shown that 4% of stars exhibit 24 um excess and 16% exhibit 70 um
excess. We show that the Solar System would have been amongst the brightest of
these systems before the LHB at both 24 and 70 um. We find a significant
increase in 24 um emission during the LHB, which rapidly drops off and becomes
undetectable within 30 Myr, whereas the 70 um emission remains detectable until
360 Myr after the LHB. Comparison with the statistics of debris disc evolution
shows that such depletion events must be rare occurring around less than 12% of
Sun-like stars and with this level of incidence we would expect approximately 1
of the 413 Sun-like, field stars so far detected to have a 24 um excess to be
currently going through an LHB. We also find that collisional processes are

low-luminosity accretion flows, including quiescent states of X-ray binaries
and low-lunimosity active galactic nuclei. Thermally driven winds are expected
from such hot accretion flows. By assuming that the flow has self-similarity
structure in the radial direction, we solve the vertical structure of the wind
and accretion flows simultaneously and evaluate the mass loss rates by wind. We
find that the ratio of the outflow rate to the accretion rate is approximately
unity for a viscosity parameter, alpha lesssim 0.1, despite some uncertainties
in the angular momentum and temperature distributions. That is, the accretion
rate in the RIAFs is roughly proportional to the radius. Moreover, we elucidate
the effect of cooling by wind on the underneath accretion flow, finding that
this effect could be important for calculating energy spectrum of the RIAF.
Observational implications are briefly discussed in the context of Sgr A*.

dwarfs (WDs) that are slowly accreting hydrogen-rich material from low mass
main sequence or brown dwarf donors with orbital periods less than four hours.
Four binaries are presently known in the Milky Way that will reach such a
mass-transferring state in a few Gyr. Despite these predictions and
observations of progenitor binaries, there are still no secure cases of helium
core WDs among the mass-transferring cataclysmic variables (CVs). This led us
to calculate the fate of He WDs once accretion begins at a rate Mdot < 1e-10
Msol/yr set by angular momentum losses. We show here that the cold He core
temperatures (T_c < 1e7 K) and low Mdot result in ~ 1e-3 Msol of accumulated
H-rich material at the onset of the thermonuclear runaway. Shara and
collaborators noted that these large accumulated masses may lead to
exceptionally long classical nova (CN) events. For a typical donor star of 0.2
Msol, such binaries will only yield a few hundred CNe, making these events rare
amongst all CNe. We calculate the reheating of the accreting WD, allowing a
comparison to the measured WD effective temperatures in quiescent dwarf novae
and raising the possibility that WD seismology may be the best way to confirm
the presence of a He WD. We also find that a very long (> 1000 yr) stable
burning phase occurs after the CN outburst, potentially explaining enigmatic
short orbital period supersoft sources like RX J0537-7034 (P_orb = 3.5 hr) and

uniform, cross-platform vocabulary. Fortunately, ontology defines a vocabulary.
We thus propose a new agent communication layer and present the web ontology
language (OWL)-based operational ontologies that provides a declarative
description. It can be accessed by various engines to facilitate agent
communication. Further, in our operational ontologies, we define the mental
attitudes of agents that can be shared among other agents. Our architecture
enhanced the 3APL agent platform, and it is implemented as an agent
communication framework. Finally, we extended the framework to be compatible
with the web ontology language for service (OWL-S), and then develop a movie
recommendation system with four OWL-S semantic web services on the framework.
The benefits of this work are: 1) dynamic web service coordination, 2)
ontological reasoning through uniform representation, namely, the declarative
description, and 3) easy reuse and extension of both ontology and engine

observed at low and intermediate $p_T$. The jet pair yields are found to be

modification factor for jet pair yields, $J_{\rm dAu}$, seems to scale with
$p_T^{\rm sum}$= $p_T^a+p_T^b$ (scaler sum), and shows a characteristic
Cronin-like enhancement at $p_T^{\rm sum}<$5-7GeV/c. Interestingly, the level

in which the unit matrix I and three special matrices C,B,A correspond to
number 1 and three units of imaginary number i,j,k, respectively. They form
usually a ring. But some fields may be composed of some special 2-rank, even
n-rank matrices, for example, three matrices aI+bC, aI+cB, aI+dA and so on. It
is a new type of hypercomplex number fields. Finally, the physical applications

communication overhead and low processing complexity. The interference in the
network is modeled using a conflict graph whose vertices are the communication
links in the network. Two links are adjacent in this graph if and only if they
interfere with each other due to being in the same vicinity and hence cannot be
simultaneously active. The problem of scheduling the transmission of the
various links is then essentially a fractional, weighted vertex coloring
problem, for which upper bounds on the fractional chromatic number are sought
using only localized information. We present some distributed algorithms for
this problem, and discuss their worst-case performance. These algorithms are
seen to be within a bounded factor away from optimal for some well known
classes of networks and interference models.

cosmological constant in the DGP scenario, we extend this proposal to a general
DGP-inspired $F(R,\phi)$ Model. We show that modification of the induced
gravity and its coupling to a quintessence field localized on the brane,
affects the screening of the brane cosmological constant and also phantom-like
behavior on the brane. We extend our study to possible modification of the
induced gravity on the brane and for clarification some specific examples are
presented. As a result, phantom-like behavior can be realized in this setup
without violating the null energy condition at least in some subspaces of the
model parameter space. The key result of our study is the fact that a
DGP-inspired $F(R,\phi)$ scenario has the best fit with LCDM and recent
observations than other alternative theories.

critically rely on their efficient and rapid conversion to lossless channels.
We demonstrate a simple, robust, and broad-band butt-coupling technique for
connecting a metallic nanowire and a dielectric nanofiber. Conversion
efficiencies above 95% in the visible and close to 100% in the near infrared
can be achieved with realistic parameters. Moreover, by combining butt-coupling
with nanofocusing, we propose a broad-band high-throughput near-field optical
microscope.

monolayer and bilayer graphene. We take into account both the orbital effect of
the inhomogeneous perpendicular magnetic field as well as the in-plane spin
splitting due to the Zeeman interaction and to the exchange coupling possibly
induced by the proximity of a ferromagnetic insulator. We find that a single
barrier exhibits a wavevector-dependent spin filtering effect at energies close
to the transmission threshold. This effect is significantly enhanced in a
resonant double barrier configuration, where the spin polarization of the
outgoing current can be increased up to 100% by increasing the distance between
the barriers.

constant electric field and approximately in time-varying electric fields. The
inverse temperature is determined by the period of charged particle in the
Euclidean time and the negative chemical potential by the ratio of the
worldline instanton to the inverse temperature. The negativity of chemical
potential is due to the vacuum instability under strong electric fields. The
inversion of spin statistics in the vacuum persistence is a consequence of the
Bogoliubov relations for fermions and bosons.
