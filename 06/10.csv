in the pseudogap region by neutron scattering. A comparison is made to
measurements on smaller, higher quality YBa2Cu3Oy single crystals. One type of
magnetic order is observed in all samples, but does not evolve significantly
with hole doping. A second type of unusual magnetic order is observed only in
the YBa2Cu3O6.6 single crystal. This magnetism has an ordered magnetic moment
that is quantitatively consistent with the neutron experiments, but is confined
to just a small volume of the sample (~ 3%). Our findings do not support
theories that ascribe the pseudogap to a state characterized by loop-current

unusual magnetic orders in YBa2Cu3Oy.

example of the NMHV superamplitudes to show that the combined action of
conventional and dual superconformal symmetries is not sufficient to fix all
the freedom in the tree-level amplitudes. We argue that the additional
information needed comes from the study of the analytic properties of the
amplitudes. The requirement of absence of spurious singularities, together with
the correct multi-particle singular behavior, determines the unique linear
combination of superinvariants corresponding to the n-particle NMHV
superamplitude. The same result can be obtained recursively, by relating the n-
and (n-1)-particle amplitudes in the singular collinear limit. We also
formulate constraints on the loop corrections to the superamplitudes, following
from the analytic behavior in the above limits. We then show that the
holomorphic anomaly of the tree amplitudes leads to the breakdown of dual
Poincare supersymmetry (which is equivalent to ordinary special conformal
supersymmetry) of the ratio of the NMHV and MHV superamplitudes at one-loop
level, but this anomaly does not affect dual conformal symmetry.

whereby the rotation period of the polar regions is about 25-30% longer than
the equatorial regions. The Coriolis force associated with these zonal flows
perpetually ""pumps"" the convection zone fluid, and maintains a quasi-steady
circulation, poleward near the surface. What is the influence of this
meridional circulation on the underlying radiative zone, and in particular,
does it provide a significant source of mixing between the two regions? In
Paper I, we began to study this question by assuming a fixed meridional flow
pattern in the convection zone and calculating its penetration depth into the
radiative zone. We found that the amount of mixing caused depends very
sensitively on the assumed flow structure near the radiative--convective
interface. We continue this study here by including a simple model for the
convection zone ""pump"", and calculating in a self-consistent manner the
meridional flows generated in the whole Sun. We find that the global
circulation timescale depends in a crucial way on two factors: the overall
stratification of the radiative zone as measured by the Rossby number times the
square root of the Prandtl number, and, for weakly stratified systems, the
presence or absence of stresses within the radiative zone capable of breaking
the Taylor-Proudman constraint. We conclude by discussing the consequences of
our findings for the solar interior and argue that a potentially important
mechanism for mixing in Main Sequence stars has so far been neglected.

shell and discuss several conceptual issues related to the emission of
radiation flux and formation of black holes. Explicit calculations are
performed using a model for a collapsing shell which turns out to be
analytically solvable. We use the insights gained in this model to draw
reliable conclusions regarding more realistic models. We first show that any
shell of mass $M$ which collapses to a radius close to $r=2M$ will emit
approximately thermal radiation for a period of time. In particular, a shell
which collapses from some initial radius to a final radius
$2M(1-\epsilon^2)^{-1}$ (where $\epsilon \ll 1$) without forming a black hole,
will emit thermal radiation during the period $M\lesssim t \lesssim M\ln
(1/\epsilon^2)$. Later on ($t\gg M \ln(1/\epsilon^2)$), the flux from such a
shell will decay to zero exponentially. We next study the effect of
backreaction computed using the vacuum expectation value of the stress tensor
on the collapse. We find that, in any realistic collapse scenario, the
backreaction effects do \emph{not} prevent the formation of the event horizon.
The time at which the event horizon is formed is, of course, delayed due to the
radiated flux -- which decreases the mass of the shell -- but this effect is
not sufficient to prevent horizon formation. We also clarify several conceptual
issues and provide pedagogical details of the calculations in the Appendices to
the paper.

sticking, fragmentation (shattering, breakage, and erosion) -- are included and
the effects on the internal structure of the aggregates are also tabulated. The
dust aggregate evolution model is applied to an homogeneous and static cloud of
temperature 10 K and gas densities between 10^3 and 10^7 cm^-3. The coagulation
is followed locally on timescales of ~10^7 yr. We find that the growth can be
divided into two stages: a growth dominated phase and a fragmentation dominated
phase. Initially, the mass distribution is relatively narrow and shifts to
larger sizes with time. At a certain point, dependent on the material
properties of the grains as well as on the gas density, collision velocities
will become sufficiently energetic to fragment particles, halting the growth
and replenishing particles of lower mass. Eventually, a steady state is
reached, where the mass distribution is characterized by a mass spectrum of
approximately equal amount of mass per logarithmic size bin. The amount of
growth that is achieved depends on the cloud's lifetime. If clouds exist on
free-fall timescales the effects of coagulation on the dust size distribution
are very minor. On the other hand, if clouds have long-term support mechanisms,
the impact of coagulation is important, resulting in a significant decrease of
the opacity on timescales longer than the initial collision timescale between

the sky from time-ordered data which include correlated noise, such as those
gathered by Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments. It works efficiently
on platforms ranging from small workstations to the most massively parallel
supercomputers. Map-making is a critical step in the analysis of all CMB data
sets, and the maximum-likelihood approach is the most accurate and widely
applicable algorithm; however, it is a computationally challenging task. This
challenge will only increase with the next generation of ground-based,
balloon-borne and satellite CMB polarization experiments. The faintness of the
B-mode signal that these experiments seek to measure requires them to gather
enormous data sets. MADmap is already being run on up to $O(10^{11})$ time
samples, $O(10^8)$ pixels and $O(10^4)$ cores, with ongoing work to scale to
the next generation of data sets and supercomputers. We describe MADmap's
algorithm based around a preconditioned conjugate gradient solver, fast Fourier
transforms and sparse matrix operations. We highlight MADmap's ability to
address problems typically encountered in the analysis of realistic CMB data
sets and describe its application to simulations of the Planck and EBEX
experiments. The massively parallel and distributed implementation is detailed
and scaling complexities are given for the resources required. MADmap is
capable of analysing the largest data sets now being collected on computing
resources currently available, and we argue that, given Moore's Law, MADmap
will be capable of reducing the most massive projected data sets.

characteristics that differ from those of simple Bogoliubov quasiparticles for
pure d_{x^2-y^2}-wave superconductors. Here we report experimental studies of
spatially resolved quasiparticle tunnelling spectra of hole- and electron-type
cuprate superconductors that manifest direct evidences for the presence of
competing orders (COs) in the cuprates. In contrast to conventional type-II
superconductors that exhibit enhanced local density of states (LDOS) peaking at
zero energy near the centre of field-induced vortices, the vortex-state LDOS of
YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-\delta} (Y-123) and La_{0.1}Sr_{0.9}CuO_2 (La-112) remains
suppressed inside the vortex core, with pseudogap (PG)-like features at an
energy larger (smaller) than the superconducting (SC) gap \Delta_{SC} in Y-123
(La-112). Energy histograms of the SC and PG features reveal steady spectral
shifts from SC to PG with increasing magnetic field H. These findings may be
explained by coexisting COs and SC: For hole-type cuprates with PG above T_c,
the primary CO gap (V_{CO}) is larger than \Delta_{SC} and the corresponding
COs are charge/pair-density waves with wave-vectors parallel to
(\pi,0)/(0,\pi). For electron-type cuprates without PG above T_c, V_{CO} is
smaller than \Delta_{SC} and the CO wave-vector is along (\pi,\pi). This CO
scenario may be extended to the ARPES data to consistently account for the
presence (absence) of Fermi arcs in hole- (electron)-type cuprates. Fourier
transformation of the vortex-state LDOS in Y-123 further reveals multiple sets
of energy-independent wave-vectors due to field-enhanced pair- and spin-density
waves. These results imply important interplay of SC with low-energy collective
excitations.

J. Fine and H. S. Wilf proved that for any positive integers r and s, if a is
an infinite seqeunce of period r and b is an infinite sequence of period s such
that a_i=b_i for all i with 1\le i\le r+s-(r,s), then a=b. This is equivalent
to the following result, which is commonly referred to as the Fine-Wilf
theorem: for any positive integers r and s, if w is a finite sequence that is
both r-periodic and s-periodic, and |w|\ge r+s-(r,s), then w is (r,s)-periodic.
The Fine-Wilf theorem was generalized to finite sequences with three periods by
M. G. Castelli, F. Mignosi, and A. Restivo, and in general by J. Justin, and
even more broadly by R. Tijdeman and L. Zamboni. They introduced functions f

positive integers, and they proved that for a sequence p=(p_1,p_2,...,p_n), a
finite sequence w with periods p_i, i=1,2,..., n and length at least fw(p) must
be (p)-periodic as well, and that there exists a sequence w of length fw(p)-1
that is p_i-periodic for all i, but not (p)-periodic. In this paper, we follow
ideas introduced by S. Constantinescu and L. Ilie to obtain an alternative

oscillatory motions. Oscillations in spicules have been observed for a long

based facilities with superb spatial, temporal and spectral capacities brought
new aspects in the research of spicule dynamics. Here we review the progress

the range of orbits that intercept the appropriate amount of stellar flux to

stars in these zones, which are close-in due to decreased stellar luminosity,
may also undergo significant tidal heating. Tidal heating may span a wide range
for terrestrial exoplanets and may significantly affect conditions near the
surface. For example, if heating rates on an exoplanet are near or greater than
that on Io (where tides drive volcanism that resurface the planet at least

the minimum to initiate plate tectonics, then CO_2 may not be recycled through

Also the range of albedos among the small Trojans is wider. We attribute the
Trojan albedos to an evolutionary effect: the small Trojans are more likely to
be collisional fragments and so their surfaces would be younger. A younger
surface means less cumulative exposure to the space environment, which suggests
that their surfaces would not be as dark as those of the large, primordial

correlation of higher albedo with smaller diameter in our sample alone and in a

(PNe) in the INT Photometric H-Alpha Survey (IPHAS) catalogue. We present the
PN search and the list of selected candidates. We cross correlate the selected
candidates with a number of existing infrared galactic surveys in order to gain
further insight into the nature of the candidates. Spectroscopy of a subset of
objects is used to estimate the number of PNe present in the entire candidate
list.
  Aims. The overall aim of the IPHAS PN project is to carry out a deep census
of PNe in the northern Galactic plane, an area where PN detections are clearly
lacking.
  Methods. The PN search is carried out on the IPHAS photometric catalogues.
The candidate selection is based on the IPHAS and 2MASS/UKIDSS colours of the
objects and the final candidate selection is made visually.
  Results. From the original list of ~600 million IPHAS detections we have
selected a total of 1005 objects. Of these, 224 are known objects, leaving us
with 781 PN candidates. Based on the initial follow-up spectroscopy, we expect
the list to include very young and proto-PNe in addition to genuine, normal PNe
(~16 %) and emission line objects other than PNe. We present additional
criteria to select the most probable PN candidates from our candidate list.

redshift ranges. We quantify in detail the observational selection biases and
we check our covariance and error estimate techniques using ensembles of
semi-analytic mock catalogues. We finally compare our measurements to the
cosmological model predictions from the mock surveys.
  At odds with other measurements, we find a weak dependence of galaxy
clustering on luminosity in all redshift bins explored. A mild dependence on
stellar mass is instead observed. At z~0.7, wp(rp) shows strong excess power on
large scales. We interpret this as produced by large-scale structure dominating
the survey volume and extending preferentially in direction perpendicular to
the line-of-sight. We do not see any significant evolution with redshift of the
amplitude of clustering for bright and/or massive galaxies.
  The clustering measured in the zCOSMOS data at 0.5<z<1 for galaxies with
log(M/M_\odot)>=10 is only marginally consistent with predictions from the mock
surveys. On scales larger than ~2 h^-1 Mpc, the observed clustering amplitude
is compatible only with ~1% of the mocks. Thus, if the power spectrum of matter
is LCDM with standard normalization and the bias has no unnatural
scale-dependence, this result indicates that COSMOS has picked up a
particularly rare, ~2-3 sigma positive fluctuation in a volume of ~10^6 h^-1

of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy, based on B and V time series photometry
obtained with the MagIC camera of the 6.5 m Magellan Clay telescope and
complementary HST archive data. Light curves and accurate periodicities were
obtained for 30 RR Lyrae stars and 1 SX Phoenicis variable. The RR Lyrae sample
includes 15 fundamental-mode pulsators, 13 first-overtone pulsators, 1
candidate double-mode pulsator and one RR Lyrae star with uncertain type
classification.
  The average and minimum periods of the ab-type RR Lyrae stars, <Pab>=0.590
days, P(ab,min)=0.53297 days, and the position in the horizontal branch
type--metallicity plane, indicate that the cluster has Oosterhoff-intermediate
properties, basically confirming previous indications by Mackey & Gilmore
(2003b), although with some differences both in the period and type
classification of individual variables.
  The average apparent magnitude of the Fornax 5 RR Lyrae stars is
<V(RR)>=21.35 +/- 0.02 mag (sigma=0.07 mag, average on 14 stars more likely
belonging to the cluster, and having well sampled light curves). This value
leads to a true distance modulus of mu0=20.76 +/- 0.07 (d=141.9 (+4.6;-4.5)
kpc) if we adopt for the cluster the metal abundance by Buonanno et al. (1998;
[Fe/H]=-2.20 +/- 0.20), or mu0=20.66 +/- 0.07 (d=135.5 (+4.4;-4.3) kpc), if we
adopt Strader et al.'s (2003) metal abundance ([Fe/H]=-1.73 +/- 0.13).

exact reason of this has not been pinpointed until now. Our explanation is that
quantum algorithms know in advance 50% of the solution of the problem they will
find in the future. In fact they can be represented as the sum of all the
possible histories of a respective ""advanced information classical algorithm"".
This algorithm, given the advanced information (50% of the bits encoding the
problem solution), performs the operations (oracle's queries) still required to
identify the solution. Each history corresponds to a possible way of getting
the advanced information and a possible result of computing the missing
information. This explanation of the quantum speed up has an immediate
practical consequence: the speed up comes from comparing two classical
algorithms, with and without advanced information, with no physics involved.
This simplification could open the way to a systematic exploration of the
possibilities of speed up.

based on the resonant production of particles during inflation. It is known
that this phenomenon can trap the inflaton for a fraction of e-fold. This
effect is governed by the mass of the produced particles and by their coupling
to the inflaton, parameters which can depend on the expectation value of other
fields. If one of such additional fields - a 'modulaton' - is light, then its
fluctuations, acquired during the earlier stages of inflation, will induce a
spatial modulation of the trapping, and thus of the end of inflation,
corresponding to a curvature perturbation. We calculate the power spectrum,
bispectrum and trispectrum of the curvature perturbations generated by this
mechanism, taking into account the perturbations due to the inflaton
fluctuations as well. We find that modulated trapping could provide the main
contribution to the observed power spectrum and lead to detectable primordial
non-gaussianities.

sources from the 13^H XMM-Newton/Chandra Deep Field by redshift and galaxy
type: active galactic nucleus (AGN) or star forming galaxy (SFG). We directly
detect 70um counterparts (at >3sigma significance) for 22.5% (92/408) of the
radio sources, while for the rest we perform stacking analysis by redshift and
galaxy type. For the sources detected at 70um we find that the median and
scatter of the observed flux density ratio, q70, are similar to previous
results in the literature, but with a slight decrease in q70 towards higher
redshifts. Of the radio sources detected at 70um 8/92 were already classified
as AGN, but two of which maybe SFGs. For the stacked sources we obtain a
detection for the SFGs at every redshift bin which implies they have mean flux
densities a factor ~5 below the original 70um detection limit. For the stacked
AGN we obtain a detection only in our highest redshift bin (1<~z<~5) where we
may be sampling hot dust associated with the AGN at rest-frame 12-35um. The
combined observed mean value of q70 for the SFGs (detected and non-detected at
70um) decreases gradually with redshift, consistent with tracks derived from
empirical spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of local SFGs. Upon closer
inspection and when comparing with tracks of appropriate luminosity, the values
of q70 broadly agree at low redshift. However, at z~1, the observed q70 (for
ULIRGs) is 2sigma below the value seen for local ULIRGs tracks, implying a
difference in the SED between local and z~1 ULIRGs. At higher redshifts, the
convergence of the tracks and the higher uncertainties in q70 do not allow us
to determine if such a difference persists.

representation theory of ``vertex operators'' and the infinite wedge
representation. Many of these operators arise naturally from correspondences on
the moduli spaces, such as Nakajima's Heisenberg operators, and Grojnowski's
vertex operators.
  In this paper, we build a new vertex operator out of the Chern class of a
vector bundle on a pair of moduli spaces. This operator has the advantage that
it connects to the partition function by definition. It also incorporates the
canonical class of the surface, whereas many other studies assume that the
class vanishes. When the moduli space is the Hilbert scheme, we present an
explicit expression in the Nakajima operators, and the resulting combinatorial
identities.

access to correlated discrete memoryless source sequences. We establish lower

establishing the capacity, when the underlying channel consists of independent,
parallel and reversely degraded wiretap channels. In the lower bound, the
equivocation terms of the source and channel components are functionally
additive. The secret-key rate is maximized by optimally balancing the the
source and channel contributions. This tradeoff is illustrated in detail for
the Gaussian case where it is also shown that Gaussian codebooks achieve the
capacity. When the eavesdropper also observes a source sequence, the secret-key
capacity is established when the sources and channels of the eavesdropper are a
degraded version of the legitimate receiver. Finally the case when the

window, i.e., for $p = (1+\epsilon)/n$ where $\epsilon^3 n \to \infty$ and
$\epsilon=o(1)$.
  Our description is particularly simple for $\epsilon = o(n^{-1/4})$, where
the giant component $C_1$ is contiguous with the following model (i.e., every
graph property that holds with high probability for this model also holds
w.h.p. for $C_1$). Let $Z$ be normal with mean $\frac23 \epsilon^3 n$ and
variance $\epsilon^3 n$, and let $K$ be a random 3-regular graph on $2\lfloor
Z\rfloor$ vertices. Replace each edge of $K$ by a path, where the path lengths
are i.i.d. geometric with mean $1/\epsilon$. Finally, attach an independent
Poisson($1-\epsilon$)-Galton-Watson tree to each vertex.
  A similar picture is obtained for larger $\epsilon=o(1)$, in which case the
random 3-regular graph is replaced by a random graph with $N_k$ vertices of
degree $k$ for $k\geq 3$, where $N_k$ has mean and variance of order
$\epsilon^k n$.
  This description enables us to determine fundamental characteristics of the
supercritical random graph. Namely, we can infer the asymptotics of the
diameter of the giant component for any rate of decay of $\epsilon$, as well as
the mixing time of the random walk on $C_1$.

i.e., for $p = \frac{1+\epsilon}n$ where $\epsilon^3 n \to \infty$ and
$\epsilon=o(1)$. This parameter was extensively studied for fixed $\epsilon >
0$, yet results for $\epsilon=o(1)$ outside the critical window were only
obtained very recently. Prior to this work, Riordan and Wormald gave precise
estimates on the diameter, however these did not cover the entire supercritical
regime (namely, when $\epsilon^3 n\to\infty$ arbitrarily slowly). {\L}uczak and
Seierstad estimated its order throughout this regime, yet their upper and lower
bounds differed by a factor of $1000/7$.
  We show that throughout the emerging supercritical phase, i.e. for any
$\epsilon=o(1)$ with $\epsilon^3 n \to \infty$, the diameter of $C_1$ is with
high probability asymptotic to $D(\epsilon,n)=(3/\epsilon)\log(\epsilon^3 n)$.
This constitutes the first proof of the asymptotics of the diameter valid
throughout this phase. The proof relies on a recent structure result for the
supercritical giant component, which reduces the problem of estimating
distances between its vertices to the study of passage times in first-passage
percolation. The main advantage of our method is its flexibility. It also
implies that in the emerging supercritical phase the diameter of the 2-core of
$C_1$ is w.h.p. asymptotic to $(2/3)D(\epsilon,n)$, and the maximal distance in
$C_1$ between any pair of kernel vertices is w.h.p. asymptotic to

3.8sigma. This dramatic evolution is qualitatively similar to the evolution of
the star-forming galaxy population in clusters known as the Butcher-Oemler

degenerate, under some gap conditions with the remainder of the spectrum. We
show here how to extend this approach to the case when the ground state of the
unperturbed Hamiltonian is degenerate. More precisely, we prove that the
switching procedure can still be performed when the initial states are
eigenstates of the finite rank self-adjoint operator $\cP_0 V \cP_0$, where
$\cP_0$ is the projection onto a degenerate eigenspace of $H_0$.

show that the adaptive design obtained by maximizing the item information leads
to a consistent and asymptotically normal ability estimator in the case of the

the two- and three-parameter logistic models. Similar asymptotic properties are
established for the modified designs and the resulting estimator. Examples are

Camera for Surveys (ACS) data. The ACS imaging in the F814W filter covered 85
LAEs of the 119 LAEs identified in the full two square degree field, and 47
LAEs of them are detected in the ACS images. Nearly half of them are spatially
extended with a size larger than 0.15 arcsec (~0.88 kpc at z=5.7) up to 0.4
arcsec (~2.5 kpc at z=5.7). The others are nearly unresolved compact objects.
Two LAEs show double-component structures, indicating interaction or merging of
building components to form more massive galaxies. By stacking the ACS images
of all the detected sources, we obtain a Sersic parameter of n~0.7 with a
half-light radius of 0.13 arcsec (0.76 kpc), suggesting that the majority of
ACS detected LAEs have not spheroidal-like but disk-like or irregular light
profiles. Comparing ACS F814W magnitudes (I_814) with Subaru/Suprime-Cam
magnitudes in the NB816, i', and z' bands, we find that the ACS imaging in the
F814W band mainly probes UV continuum rather than Lyman alpha line emission. UV
continuum sizes tend to be larger for LAEs with larger Ly\alpha emission
regions as traced by the NB816 imaging. The non-detection of 38 LAEs in the ACS
images is likely due to the fact that their surface brightness is even too low
both in the UV continuum and Lyalpha emission. Estimating I_814 for the LAEs
with ACS non-detection from the z' and NB816 magnitudes, we find that 16 of
these are probably LAEs with a size larger than 0.15 arcsec in UV continuum.
All these results suggest that our LAE sample contains systematically larger
LAEs in UV continuum size than those previously studied at z~6.

a pre-existing background, evolving in vacuum even at zero temperature, and are
captured by stable subatomic particles to form very distinctive quantized
patterns. The evolving shells bring, for instance, to the creation of a
fractal-type structure of electromagnetic layers around a conductive body. This
property is then used to justify, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the
attractive Casimir force of two metal plates. The analysis is carried out by
standard arguments, except that here the surrounding zero-point energy is

instability is examined in one spatial dimension, which is an approximation for
a quasi-planar filament boundary. It is confirmed, that the force on the

nonlinear stage of the instability, oscillates around a mean value that equals
the magnetic pressure gradient force. The forces acting on the electrons due to
the electrostatic and the magnetic field have a similar strength. The
electrostatic field reduces the confining force close to the stable equilibrium

  The GPU-based correlator outperforms a single-threaded CPU equivalent by a
factor of 60 for a 32 antenna array, and runs on commodity PC hardware. The
extra compute capability provided by the GPU maximises the correlation
capability of a PC while retaining the fast development time associated with

high performance, custom built hardware and pure CPU-based software

using the solution of a mass operator that contains both confinement and

those point-form, and instant and front-form ones in a parallel momentum

important role. Taking into account that only the last set of results
represents a reasonable basis for improving the description of the charge form

phase transition - color deconfinement and QCD-vacuum reconstruction - within
the nuclear matter. That is why both phenomena should be taken into account
side by side, as the gravitational collapse is considered. Since, under the
above transition, the hadronic-phase vacuum (filled up with gluon and chiral
$q\bar q$-condensates) turns into the ""empty"" (perturbation) subhadronic-phase
one and, thus, the corresponding (very high) pressure falls down rather
abruptly, the formerly cold (degenerated) nuclear medium starts to implode into
the new vacuum. If the mass of a star is sufficiently large, then this
implosion produces an enormous heating, which stops only after quark-gluon
plasma of a temperature about 100 MeV (or even higher) is formed to withstand
the gravitational compression (whereas the highest temperatures of supernovae
bursts are, at least, one order lower). As a consequence, a ""burning wall"" must

catalogues based on the SDSS: the ROSAT-SDSS Galaxy Cluster Survey, and the
MaxBCG Catalogue. Based on a volume limited sample of galaxies drawn from the
spectroscopic DR5 SDSS, we constructed sub-samples of clusters of galaxies with
more than ten members. Scaling relations as well as segregation of galaxy
properties as a function of the normalized clustocentric radii are analyzed.
The properties of galaxies in clusters are compared with those of field
galaxies. Galaxies in X-ray and MaxBCG selected clusters show similar
size-luminosity relations. At equal luminosity, late type galaxies in the field
have sizes smaller than cluster galaxies of the same morphological type. The
Faber-Jackson relation for early-type galaxies in clusters is also the same for
X-ray selected and MaxBCG clusters. We found clear differences between the
dynamical properties of galaxies in clusters, the brightest cluster galaxies
($BCG_s$) and field galaxies. Using several criteria to classify galaxies into
morphological types, we reproduce the well know morphological segregation. The
correlation is up to $r/r_{200} \sim 1$. For the whole range of clustocentric
distances, X-ray selected clusters present a higher fraction of early type
galaxies than MaxBCG clusters. We also found that bright galaxies
preferentially inhabit the cluster centers. Median sizes of galaxies, such as
the radius that enclose 50% of petrosian flux $r_{50}$, present a behaviour
that also depends on the cluster selection criteria. The resultsare discussed
in terms of the different processes that affect the evolution of galaxies in
different environments.

pinning models have been put on mathematical grounds. The picture is
particularly complete if the disorder is 'relevant' or 'irrelevant' in the
Harris criterion sense: the question addressed is whether quenched disorder
leads to a critical behavior which is different from the one observed in the
pure, i.e. annealed, system. The Harris criterion prediction is based on the
sign of the specific heat exponent of the pure system, but it yields no
prediction in the case of vanishing exponent. This case is called 'marginal',
and the physical literature is divided on what one should observe for marginal
disorder, notably there is no agreement on whether a small amount of disorder
leads or not to a difference between the critical point of the quenched system
and the one for the pure system. In a previous work (arXiv:0811.0723) we have
proven that the two critical points differ at marginality of at least
exp(-c/beta^4), where c>0 and beta^2 is the disorder variance, for beta in
(0,1) and Gaussian IID disorder. The purpose of this paper is to improve such a
result: we establish in particular that the exp(-c/beta^4) lower bound on the
shift can be replaced by exp(-c(b)/beta^b), c(b)>0 for b>2 (b=2 is the known
upper bound and it is the result claimed in [Derrida, Hakim, Vannimenus, JSP
1992]), and we deal with very general distribution of the IID disorder
variables. The proof relies on coarse graining estimates and on a fractional
moment-change of measure argument based on multi-body potential modifications
of the law of the disorder.

radiative efficiency. The inviscid mini-disc model was previously constructed
for a non-rotating black hole. We extend the model to the case of a spinning
black hole, calculate the structure and radiative efficiency of the disc and
find their dependence on the black hole spin. If the angular momenta of the

Glaser in 1973. Causal perturbation theory is a mathematically rigorous
approach to renormalization theory, which makes it possible to put the
theoretical setup of perturbative quantum field theory on a sound mathematical
basis. Epstein and Glaser solved this problem for a special class of
distributions, the time-ordered products, that fulfill a causality condition,
which itself is a basic requirement in axiomatic quantum field theory. In their
original work, Epstein and Glaser studied only theories involving scalar
particles. In this review, the extension of the method to theories with higher
spin, including gravity, is presented. Furthermore, specific examples are
presented in order to highlight the technical differences between the causal
method and other regularization methods, like, e.g. dimensional regularization.

vertices of G can be labeled from 1 to n such that the labels of every pair of

  In this paper, we present a 2-approximation algorithm for the bandwidth
problem that takes worst-case O(1.9797^n) time and uses polynomial space. This
improves both the previous best 2- and 3-approximation algorithms of Cygan et
al. which have an O(3^n) and O(2^n) worst-case time bounds, respectively. Our
algorithm is based on constructing bucket decompositions of the input graph. A
bucket decomposition partitions the vertex set of a graph into ordered sets
(called buckets) of (almost) equal sizes such that all edges are either
incident to vertices in the same bucket or to vertices in two consecutive
buckets. The idea is to find the smallest bucket size for which there exists a
bucket decomposition. The algorithm uses a simple divide-and-conquer strategy
along with dynamic programming to achieve this improved time bound.

forcing function becomes a Dirac delta function. For this class of equations,
the forcing strength $q_k$, the oscillation frequency $\af_k$, and the period
are allowed to vary from cycle to cycle. Such equations arise in astrophysical
orbital problems in extended mass distributions, in the reheating problem for
inflationary cosmologies, and in periodic Schr{\""o}dinger equations. The growth
rates for solutions to the periodic differential equation can be described by a
matrix transformation, where the matrix elements vary from cycle to cycle.
Working in the delta function limit, this paper addresses several coupled
issues: We find the growth rates for the $2 \times 2$ matrices that describe
the solutions. This analysis is carried out in the limiting regimes of both
large $q_k \gg 1$ and small $q_k \ll 1$ forcing strength parameters. For the
latter case, we present an alternate treatment of the dynamics in terms of a
Fokker-Planck equation, which allows for a comparison of the two approaches.
Finally, we elucidate the relationship between the fundamental parameters
$(\af_k,q_k)$ appearing in the stochastic differential equation and the matrix
elements that specify the corresponding discrete map. This work provides
analytic -- and accurate -- expressions for the growth rates of these
stochastic differential equations in both the $q_k \gg1 $ and the $q_k \ll 1$
limits.

in ${\mathbb{C}}^{n}.$ For such a domain we define a new notion between strict
pseudo-convexity and pseudo-convexity: the size of the set $W$ of weakly
pseudo-convex points on $\partial \Omega $ is small with respect to Minkowski
dimension: near each point in the boundary $\partial \Omega ,$ there is at
least one complex tangent direction in which the slices of $W$ has a upper
Minkowski dimension strictly smaller than $2.$ We propose to call this notion
""strong pseudo-convexity""; this word is free since ""strict pseudo-convexity""
gets the precedence in the case where all the points in $\partial \Omega $ are
stricly pseudo-convex.
  For such domains we prove that if $S$ is a separated sequence of points
contained in the support of a divisor in the Blaschke class, then a canonical
measure associated to $S$ is bounded. If moreover the domain is $p$-regular,
and the sequence $S$ is dual bounded in the Hardy space $H^{p}(\Omega),$ then
the previous measure is Carleson.
  As an application we prove a theorem on interpolating sequences in bounded
convex domains of finte type in ${\mathbb{C}}^{n}.$
  Examples of such pseudo-convex domains are finite type domains in
${\mathbb{C}}^{2},$ finite type convex domains in ${\mathbb{C}}^{n},$ finite
type domains which have locally diagonalizable Levi form, domains with real
analytic boundary and of course, stricly pseudo-convex domains in
${\mathbb{C}}^{n}.$
  Domains like $|{z_{1}}| ^{2}+\exp \{1-|{z_{2}}| ^{-2}\}<1,$ which are not of
finite type are nevertheless strongly pseudo-convex, in this sense.

Better control of the uncertainties of the strange and antistrange parton

|V_cs| CKM matrix elements, obtaining central values in agreement with the
current global CKM fit: specifically we find |V_cd|=0.244\pm 0.019 and
|V_cs|=0.96\pm 0.07. Our result for |V_cs| is more precise than any previous
direct determination. We also reassess the uncertainty on the NuTeV
determination of \sin^2\theta_W through the Paschos-Wolfenstein relation: we
find that the very large uncertainties in the strange valence momentum fraction
are sufficient to bring the NuTeV result into complete agreement with the

nonlinear materials containing pores or rigid inclusions. Full-field numerical
simulations are carried out using a Fast-Fourier Transform algorithm [H.
Moulinec, P. Suquet, C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris II 318, 1417 (1994)], while the
theoretical results are obtained by means of the `second-order' nonlinear
homogenization method [P. Ponte Castaneda, J. Mech. Phys. Solids 50, 737
(2002)]. The effect of nonlinearity and inclusion concentration is investigated
in the context of power-law (with strain-rate sensitivity m) behavior for the
matrix phase under in-plane shear loadings. Overall, the `second-order'
estimates are found to be in good agreement with the numerical simulations,
with the best agreement for the rigidly reinforced materials. For the porous
systems, as the nonlinearity increases (m decreases), the strain field is found
to localize along shear bands passing through the voids (the strain
fluctuations becoming unbounded) and the effective stress exhibits a singular
behavior in the dilute limit. More specifically, for small porosities and fixed
nonlinearity m>0, the effective stress decreases linearly with increasing
porosity. However, for ideally plastic behavior (m = 0), the dependence on
porosity becomes non-analytic. On the other hand, for rigidly-reinforced
composites, the strain field adopts a tile pattern with bounded strain
fluctuations, and no singular behavior is observed (to leading order) in the
dilute limit.
