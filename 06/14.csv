Fermi points with quadratic dispersions, if trigonal-warping and other high
order contributions are ignored. We show that as a result of this qualitative
difference from single-layer graphene, short-range (or screened Coulomb)
interactions are marginally relevant. We use renormalization group to study
their effects on low-energy properties of the system, and show that the two
quadratic Fermi points spontaneously split into four Dirac points, at zero
temperature. This results in a nematic state that spontaneously breaks the
six-fold lattice rotation symmetry (combined with layer permutation) down to a
two-fold one, with a finite transition temperature. Critical properties of the
transition and effects of trigonal warping are also discussed.

\bar s$ is calculated within a simple quark model with chromomagnetic
interaction and effective quark masses extracted from meson and baryon spectra.
It is tempting to see if this spectrum can accommodate the resonance Y(4140),
observed by the CDF collaboration, but not yet confirmed. The results seem to
favour the J$^{PC}$ = 1$^{++}$ sector where the coupling to the VV channel is
nearly as small as that of X(3872), when described as a $c \bar c q \bar q$
tetraquark. This suggests that Y(4140) could possibly be the strange partner of
X(3872), in a tetraquark interpretation. However the sector J$^{PC}$ = 0$^{++}$
cannot entirely be excluded. This work questions the practice of extracting
effective quark masses containing spin independent contributions, from mesons
and baryons, to be used in multiquark systems as well.

NGC1961. This galaxy is unusual among late-type (Sc) disk galaxies in having a
very large radial extent and inferred dynamical mass. We propose a head-on
collision scenario to explain the perturbed morphology of this galaxy- both the
off-centered rings and the inflated radius. This scenario is supported by the
detection of a steep velocity gradient in the CO(1-0) map at the position of a
southwest peak in radio continuum and near-infrared emission. This peak would
represent the remnant of the disrupting companion. We use numerical models to
demonstrate the plausibility of the scenario. While ram pressure stripping
could in principle be important for shocking the atomic gas and produce the
striking head-tail morphology, the non detection of this small galaxy group in
X-ray emission suggests that any hot intragroup medium has too low a density.
The collision with the companion of mass ratio 1:4 produces a lopsided wave,
which accounts for the sharp boundary observed in the atomic gas on the
southern side. We argue that NGC1961 has a strongly warped disk, which gives
the false impression of a nearly face-on system; the main disk is actually more
edge-on, and this error in the true inclination has led to the surprisingly
high dynamical mass for a morphologically late-type galaxy. In addition, the
outward propagating ring artificially enlarges the disk. The collision
de-stabilizes the inner disk and can provide gas inflow to the active nucleus.

solutions simplify. If only free scalar field is included then universe
undergoes non-singular oscillations. For the model with cosmological constant,
different behaviours are obtained depending on the value of $\Lambda$. If the
value of $\Lambda$ is sufficiently small, bouncing solutions with asymptotic de
Sitter stages are obtained. However if the value of $\Lambda$ exceeds critical
value $\Lambda_{\text{c}} =\frac{\sqrt{3}m^2_{\text{Pl}}}{2\pi\gamma^3} \simeq
21 m^2_{\text{Pl}}$ then solutions become oscillatory. Subsequently we study
models with a massive scalar field. We find that this model possess generic
inflationary attractors. In particular field, initially situated in the bottom
of the potential, is driven up during the phase of quantum bounce. This
subsequently leads to the phase of inflation. Finally we find that, comparing

of the particle trajectory, and computes by permuting particles. Whereas
topological quantum computation requires anyons, permutational quantum
computation can be performed with ordinary spin-1/2 particles, using a variant
of the spin-network scheme of Marzuoli and Rasetti. We do not know whether
permutational computation is universal. It may represent a new complexity class
within BQP. Nevertheless, permutational quantum computers can in polynomial
time approximate matrix elements of certain irreducible representations of the
symmetric group and simulate certain processes in the Ponzano-Regge spin foam
model of quantum gravity. No polynomial time classical algorithms for these
problems are known.

surfaces which are more trapped in a (future, respectively past) causal

combinatorial geometry and phase transitions occurring in modern
high-dimensional data analysis and signal processing. In data analysis, such
transitions arise as abrupt breakdown of linear model selection, robust data
fitting or compressed sensing reconstructions, when the complexity of the model
or the number of outliers increases beyond a threshold. In combinatorial
geometry these transitions appear as abrupt changes in the properties of face
counts of convex polytopes when the dimensions are varied. The thresholds in
these very different problems appear in the same critical locations after
appropriate calibration of variables.
  These thresholds are important in each subject area: for linear modelling,
they place hard limits on the degree to which the now-ubiquitous
high-throughput data analysis can be successful; for robustness, they place
hard limits on the degree to which standard robust fitting methods can tolerate
outliers before breaking down; for compressed sensing, they define the sharp
boundary of the undersampling/sparsity tradeoff in undersampling theorems.
  Existing derivations of phase transitions in combinatorial geometry assume
the underlying matrices have independent and identically distributed (iid)
Gaussian elements. In applications, however, it often seems that Gaussianity is
not required. We conducted an extensive computational experiment and formal
inferential analysis to test the hypothesis that these phase transitions are
{\it universal} across a range of underlying matrix ensembles. The experimental
results are consistent with an asymptotic large-$n$ universality across matrix
ensembles; finite-sample universality can be rejected.

definitely fix the symmetry quantum numbers to specific values with second
quantized field operators which are restricted by delta functions of a Dirac

perform an anomalous doubling for the delta functions of the two-particle parts
so that a Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation can be taken for corresponding

extended to an ensemble average over the external magnetic field so that mean
eigenvalue densities and eigenvalue correlations can be obtained.

Theory, 4(4):975-1030, 2010",,,"math.FA math.DS math.MG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A resistance network is a connected graph $(G,c)$. The conductance function
$c_{xy}$ weights the edges, which are then interpreted as conductors of
possibly varying strengths. The Dirichlet energy form $\mathcal E$ produces a
Hilbert space structure (which we call the energy space ${\mathcal H}_{\mathcal
E}$) on the space of functions of finite energy.
  We use the reproducing kernel $\{v_x\}$ constructed in \cite{DGG} to analyze
the effective resistance $R$, which is a natural metric for such a network. It
is known that when $(G,c)$ supports nonconstant harmonic functions of finite
energy, the effective resistance metric is not unique. The two most natural
choices for $R(x,y)$ are the ``free resistance'' $R^F$, and the ``wired
resistance'' $R^W$. We define $R^F$ and $R^W$ in terms of the functions $v_x$
(and certain projections of them). This provides a way to express $R^F$ and
$R^W$ as norms of certain operators, and explain $R^F \neq R^W$ in terms of
Neumann vs. Dirichlet boundary conditions. We show that the metric space
$(G,R^F)$ embeds isometrically into ${\mathcal H}_{\mathcal E}$, and the metric
space $(G,R^W)$ embeds isometrically into the closure of the space of finitely
supported functions; a subspace of ${\mathcal H}_{\mathcal E}$.
  Typically, $R^F$ and $R^W$ are computed as limits of restrictions to finite
subnetworks. A third formulation $R^{tr}$ is given in terms of the trace of the
Dirichlet form $\mathcal E$ to finite subnetworks. A probabilistic approach
shows that in the limit, $R^{tr}$ coincides with $R^F$. This suggests a
comparison between the probabilistic interpretations of $R^F$ vs. $R^W$.

[Crocce et al., Phys. Rev. A 70 033811 (2004)] to estimate the number of
photons for both TE and TM modes at any given SD position. Numerical
calculations are performed considering up to 51 inter-mode couplings by varying
the SD location, driving period and laser power without any perturbations. It
is found that the number of photons created for TE modes strongly depends on SD
position, where the strongest enhancement occurs at the midpoint (not near the
cavity wall); while TM modes have weak dependence on SD position. Another
important finding is the fact that significant photon production for TM$_{111}$
modes still takes place at the midpoint even for a low laser power of 0.01
micro J/pulse, although the number of TE$_{111}$ photons decreases almost
proportionately with laser power. We also find a relatively wide tuning range
for both TE and TM modes that is correlated with the frequency variation of the
instantaneous mode functions caused by the interaction between the cavity
photons and conduction electrons in the SD excited by a pulsed laser.
