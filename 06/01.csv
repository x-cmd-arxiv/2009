the deformed algebra with new effective deformation parameters. As a
consequence, a two-particle system can be reduced to a one-particle problem for
the internal motion. As an example, the correction to the hydrogen atom $n$S

center-of-mass motion of a macroscopic body in an external potential is also
found. For such a motion, the effective deformation parameter is substantially
reduced due to a factor $1/N^2$. This explains the strangely small result
previously obtained for the minimal length from a comparison with the observed
precession of the perihelion of Mercury. From our study, an upper bound of the

Molecular dynamics simulations for simple glass-forming liquids are performed,
and a three-time correlation function is numerically calculated for general
time intervals. It is demonstrated that the three-time correlation function is
sensitive to the heterogeneous dynamics and that it reveals couplings of
correlated motions over a wide range of time scales. Furthermore, the time
scale of the heterogeneous dynamics $\tau_{\rm hetero}$ is determined by the
change in the second time interval in the three-time correlation function. The
present results show that the time scale of the heterogeneous dynamics
$\tau_{\rm hetero}$ becomes larger than the $\alpha$-relaxation time at low
temperatures and large wavelengths. We also find a dynamical scaling relation
between the time scale $\tau_{\rm hetero}$ and the length scale $\xi$ of
dynamical heterogeneity as $\tau_{\rm hetero} \sim \xi^{z}$ with $z=3$.

expensive, instruments provide only local measurements and atmospheric modeling
might represent a step ahead towards the search and selection of astronomical
sites thanks to the possibility to reconstruct 3D Cn2 maps over a surface of
several kilometers. The Antarctic Plateau represents therefore an important
benchmark test to evaluate the possibility to discriminate sites on the same
plateau. Our group (Hagelin et al. 2008) has proven that the analyses from the
ECMWF global model do not describe with the required accuracy the antarctic
boundary and surface layers in the plateau. A better description could be
obtained with a mesoscale model. The Meso-Nh model has proven to be reliable in
reproducing 3D maps of OT above mid-latitude astronomical sites (Masciadri et
al. 1999ab, 2004, Masciadri and Jabouille 2005). In this paper we study the
ability of the Meso-Nh model in reconstructing the meteorological parameters as
well as the OT above Dome C with different model configurations. We concentrate
our attention on the model abilities in reproducing the OT surface layer
thickness Hsl and the integral of the Cn2 in the free atmosphere and in the

characterized by strong radial conductivity variations. The importance of the
constraint on the Ohmic dissipation provided by the planetary luminosity is
emphasized. Planetary dynamos are likely to be of an oscillatory type, although
these oscillations may not be evident from the exterior of the planets.

Planck frequency maps. Quantify signal error effects and compare different
techniques to produce low-resolution maps.
  Methods: We derive analytical estimates of covariance of the residual noise
contained in low-resolution maps produced using a number of map-making
approaches. We test these analytical predictions using Monte Carlo simulations
and their impact on angular power spectrum estimation. We use simulations to
quantify the level of signal errors incurred in different resolution
downgrading schemes considered in this work.
  Results: We find an excellent agreement between the optimal residual noise
covariance matrices and Monte Carlo noise maps. For destriping map-makers, the
extent of agreement is dictated by the knee frequency of the correlated noise
component and the chosen baseline offset length. The significance of signal
striping is shown to be insignificant when properly dealt with. In map
resolution downgrading, we find that a carefully selected window function is
required to reduce aliasing to the sub-percent level at multipoles, ell >
2Nside, where Nside is the HEALPix resolution parameter. We show that
sufficient characterization of the residual noise is unavoidable if one is to
draw reliable contraints on large scale anisotropy.
  Conclusions: We have described how to compute the low-resolution maps, with a
controlled sky signal level, and a reliable estimate of covariance of the
residual noise. We have also presented a method to smooth the residual noise
covariance matrices to describe the noise correlations in smoothed, bandwidth
limited maps.

hydrodynamics describes geodesics on the group of volume-preserving
diffeomorphisms. A simple analogue is the Euler equation for a rigid body,
which is the geodesic equation on the rotation group with respect to a metric
determined by the moment of inertia. The metric on the group is left-invariant
but not right-invariant. We will reduce the geometry of such groups (using
techniques popularized by Milnor) to algebra on their tangent space. In
particular, the curvature can be expressed as a biquadratic form on the Lie
algebra. Arnold's result that motion of incompressible fluids has instabilities
(due to the sectional curvature being negative) can be recovered more simply.
Surprisingly, such an instability arises in rigid body mechanics as well: the
metric on SO(3) corresponding to the moment of inertia of a thin cylinder
(coin) has negative sectional curvature in one tangent plane.
  Both ideal fluids and rigid bodies can be thought of as hamiltonian systems
with a quadratic hamiltonian, but whose Poisson brackets are those of a
non-nilpotent Lie algebra. We will also describe a different point of view
towards three dimensional incompressible flow in terms of the Clebsch
parametrization. In this picture, the Poisson brackets are represented
canonically. The hamiltonian is represented by a quartic function.

directly based on the distribution of probabilities and therefore significantly
simplifies the analytical approach. The new formalism requires generalizing the

to their path analogues. Also we obtain a path balance equation and an equation
of equilibrium path. For the distribution of probabilities we obtain a
functional dependence similar to the Feynman's path integral formalism of

the production of the state free energy we illustrate a significant dependence

their respective liquid-gas critical points. We find that for all film
thicknesses of current experimental interest the combination of van der Waals
interactions and gravity leads to substantial deviations from the behavior
predicted by models in which all interatomic forces are very short ranged and
gravity is absent. In the case of a completely short-ranged system exact
mean-field analytical expressions are derived, within the continuum approach,
for the behavior of both the local and the total susceptibilities.

stretched structures emerging from the cusps of quiescent coronal streamers. In
this paper, it is suggested that the formation of blobs is a consequence of an
intrinsic instability of coronal streamers occurring at a very localized region
around the cusp. The evolutionary process of the instability, as revealed in
our calculations, can be described as follows: (1) through the localized cusp
region where the field is too weak to sustain the confinement, plasmas expand
and stretch the closed field lines radially outward as a result of the
freezing-in effect of plasma-magnetic field coupling; the expansion brings a
strong velocity gradient into the slow wind regime providing the free energy
necessary for the onset of a subsequent magnetohydrodynamic instability; (2)
the instability manifests itself mainly as mixed streaming sausage-kink modes,
the former results in pinches of elongated magnetic loops to provoke
reconnections at one or many locations to form blobs. Then, the streamer system
returns to the configuration with a lower cusp point, subject to another cycle
of streamer instability. Although the instability is intrinsic, it does not
lead to the loss of the closed magnetic flux, neither does it affect the
overall feature of a streamer. The main properties of the modeled blobs,
including their size, velocity profiles, density contrasts, and even their
daily occurrence rate, are in line with available observations.

a typical cluster core is 0.39 pc in radius, has 26 members with infrared
excess in a ratio of Class II to Class I sources of 3.7, is embedded in a
$A_K$=0.8 mag cloud clump, and has a surface density of 60 pc$^{-2}$. We
examine the nearest neighbor distances among the YSOs in several ways,
demonstrating similarity in the spacings between Class II and Class I sources

demonstrate that near-uniform source spacings in cluster cores are common,

variant due to Disertori are transformed to matrix models which are similar to
the supersymmetric model of disorder, having two matrices $Q^f$ and $Q^b$ which
correspond to the two bosonic sectors of the SUSY matrix. However the Grassman
(fermionic) sector of the SUSY matrix is omitted, and compensated by a spectral
determinant. The transformation is exact for Disertori's model, while for the
Wegner model it involves an integral which can be approximated while
maintaining mathematical control. Previous derivations of sigma models of
disorder assumed a spatially uniform saddle point independent of the Goldstone
bosons and found that corrections are well controlled in the large $N$ limit.
This paper takes into account spatial fluctuations of the Goldstone bosons and
finds that corrections to the sigma model approximation in extended systems are
controlled by powers of the inverse conductance $1/g$. In the weak localization
regime Disertori's model exhibits remarkable simplifications and is completely
controlled by perturbative expansions in various small parameters. The Wegner
model might also be controlled. The standard weak localization results of the
supersymmetric sigma model, including anomalously localized states, are
reproduced and extended.

bottleneck significantly are studied in detail to analyze the effect of an
obstacle set up in front of an exit. One is a conflict at an exit when
pedestrians evacuate from a room. We use floor field model for simulating such
behavior, which is a well-studied pedestrian model using cellular automata. The
conflicts have been taken into account by the friction parameter. However, the
friction parameter so far is a constant and does not depend on the number of
the pedestrians conflicting at the same time. Thus, we have improved the
friction parameter by the frictional function, which is a function of the
number of the pedestrians involved in the conflict. Second, we have newly
introduced the cost of turning of pedestrians at the exit. Since pedestrians
have inertia, their walking speeds decrease when they turn, and the pedestrian
outflow decreases.
  The validity of the extended model, which includes the frictional function
and the turning function, is verified by both a mean field theory and
experiments. In our experiments, the pedestrian flow increases when we put an
obstacle in front of an exit. The analytical results clearly explains the
mechanism of the effect of the obstacle, i.e., the obstacle blocks pedestrians
moving to the exit and decreases the average number of pedestrians involved in
the conflict. We have also found that an obstacle works more effectively when
we shift it from the center since pedestrians go through the exit with less
turning.

explained by the transient heating of the interstellar media in the CMZ

detection of the non-Gaussian component, corresponding to fNL = 50 for the
local model and fNL = 100 for the equilateral model of non-Gaussianity, is able
to determine nNG with a 1-sigma uncertainty of Delta nNG = 0.1 and Delta nNG =
0.3, respectively, for the Planck mission. In addition, we consider a Fisher
matrix analysis of the galaxy power spectrum to determine the expected
constraints on the running parameter nNG for the local model and of the galaxy
bispectrum for the equilateral model from future photometric and spectroscopic
surveys. We find that, in both cases, large-scale structure observations should
achieve results comparable to or even better than those from the CMB, while
showing some complementarity due to the different distribution of the
non-Gaussian signal over the relevant range of scales. Finally, we compare our
findings to the predictions on the amplitude and running of non-Gaussianity of
DBI inflation, showing how the constraints on a scale-dependent fNL(k)
translate into constraints on the parameter space of the theory.

Ekert protocol is more robust to the generalized amplitude damping. We also

respectively. The X-ray spectra can be well described with single power-law
models in both exposures. The derived X-ray photon index and the flux density
at 1 keV were found to be Gamma = 1.65 +- 0.02 and S_{1 keV} = 215 +- 5 nJy, in

spectrum (Gamma = 1.50 +- 0.01) with a nearly doubled X-ray flux density S_{1
keV} = 404^{+6}_{-5} nJy. Moreover, significant hard X-ray signals were
detected up to ~ 27 keV. In cooperation with the Suzaku, simultaneous radio,
optical, and very-high-energy gamma-ray observations were performed with the
Nobeyama Millimeter Array, the KANATA telescope, and the MAGIC telescope,
respectively. The radio and optical fluxes in the flaring state (3.04 +- 0.46
Jy and 8.93 +- 0.05 mJy at 86.75 Hz and in the V-band, respectively) were found
to be higher by a factor of 2--3 than those in the quiescent state (1.73 +-
0.26 Jy and 3.03 +- 0.01 mJy at 86.75 Hz and in the V-band, respectively). No
notable gamma-ray events were detected in either observation. The spectral
energy distribution indicated that the X-ray spectrum was dominated by inverse
Compton radiation in both observations, while synchrotron radiation exhibited a
spectral cutoff around the optical frequency. Furthermore, no significant
difference in the synchrotron cutoff frequency was found between the quiescent
and flaring states. According to a simple synchrotron self-Compton model, the
change of the spectral energy distribution is due to an increase in the energy
density of electrons with small changes of both the magnetic field strength and
the maximum Lorentz factor of electrons.

investigated in the context of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), although
generic formulae that enable application to any other forms of incoherent light

variance of fluctuations in the density and flux consists of two parts. First
is a term from the spontaneous emission coefficient which is the contribution
from a random gas of classical particles representing the corpuscular (photon)
nature of light. Second is a term from the stimulated emission coefficient
which leads to a `wave noise', or more precisely the noise arising from the
superposition of many plane waves of arbitrary phase - the normal modes of the
radiation. The origin of this second term has never been elucidated before. We
discussed one application. In the spatially homogeneous post-inflationary
epochs when the universe was reheated to GUT temperatures, the thermal CMB
density fluctuations on the horizon scale is of order the WMAP measured value

of clouds. The submillimetre data can only be used in the high column-density,
central regions of the clouds.
  It has previously been found that near-infrared polarisation mapping of
background stars does not accurately trace the magnetic field in dense cloud
regions. This may be due to a lack of aligned grains in dense regions. We test
this by comparing the field orientations measured by our two independent
polarimetry methods. We find that the field orientation deduced from the
optical data matches up well with the orientation estimated from the
submillimetre data. We therefore claim that both methods are accurately tracing
the same magnetic field in CB3. Hence, in this case, there must be significant
numbers of aligned dust grains in the high density region, and they do indeed
trace the magnetic field in the submillimetre.

and the short axis of the globule. This is consistent with the mean value of
31$\pm$3 degrees found in our previous work on prestellar cores, even though
CB3 is a protostellar core. Taken together, the six prestellar cores that we

a hierarchical wireless sensor network. Contrasted with the traditional
approach of building networks in a ""flat"" structure using sensor devices of the
same capability, the hierarchical approach deploys devices of higher capability
in a higher tier, i.e., a tier closer to the server. While query processing in
flat sensor networks has been widely studied, the study on query processing in
hierarchical sensor networks has been inadequate. In wireless sensor networks,
the main costs that should be considered are the energy for sending data and
the storage for storing queries. There is a trade-off between these two costs.
Based on this, we first propose a progressive processing method that
effectively processes a large number of continuous range queries in
hierarchical sensor networks. The proposed method uses the query merging
technique proposed by Xiang et al. as the basis and additionally considers the
trade-off between the two costs. More specifically, it works toward reducing
the storage cost at lower-tier nodes by merging more queries, and toward
reducing the energy cost at higher-tier nodes by merging fewer queries (thereby
reducing ""false alarms""). We then present how to build a hierarchical sensor
network that is optimal with respect to the weighted sum of the two costs. It
allows for a cost-based systematic control of the trade-off based on the
relative importance between the storage and energy in a given network
environment and application. Experimental results show that the proposed method
achieves a near-optimal control between the storage and energy and reduces the
cost by 0.989~84.995 times compared with the cost achieved using the flat
(i.e., non-hierarchical) setup as in the work by Xiang et al.

increases when an open system evolves by decreasing gradients in free energy

supposed to be a function of only hidden variable. We point out that the true
implication of the probability distribution of Bell's correlation function is
the distribution of the joint measurement outcomes on the two sides. So it is a
function of both hidden variable and settings. In this case, Bell's
inequalities fail. Our further analysis shows that Bell's locality holds
neither for dependent events nor for independent events. We think that the
measurements of EPR pairs are dependent events, thus violation of Bell's
inequalities cannot rule out the existence of local hidden variable. In order
to explain the results of EPR-type experiments, we suppose that polarization
entangled photon pair can be composed of two circularly or linearly polarized
photons with correlated hidden variables, and a couple of experiments of
quantum measurement are proposed. The first uses delayed measurement on one
photon of the EPR pair to demonstrate directly whether measurement on the other
could have any non-local influence on it. Then several experiments are
suggested to reveal the components of polarization entangled photon pair. The
last one uses successive polarization measurements on a pair of EPR photons to
show that two photons with a same quantum state will behave in the same way
under the same measuring condition.

(not just von Neumann regular real rings). In other words we attempt to
characterize and construct real closure * of commutative unitary rings that are
real. We also make some very interesting and significant discoveries regarding
maximal partial orderings of rings, Baer rings and essentail extension of
rings. The first Theorem itself gives us a noteworthy bijection between maximal
partial orderings of two rings by which one is a rational extension of the
other. We characterize conditions when a Baer reduced ring can be integrally
closed in its total quotient ring. We prove that Baer hulls of rings have
exactly one automorphism (the identity) and we even prove this for a general
case (Lemma 12). Proposition 14 allows us to study essential extensions of
rings and their relation with minimal prime spectrum of the lower ring. And
Theorem 15 gives us a construction of the real spectrum of a ring generated by
adjoining idempotents to a reduced commutative subring (for instance the
construction of Baer hull of reduced commutative rings).
  From most of the above interesting theories we prove that there is a
bijection between the real closure * of real rings (upto isomorphisms) and
their maximal partial orderings. We then attempt to develop some topological
theories for the set of real closure * of real rings (upto isomorphism) that
will help us give a topological characterization in terms of the real and prime
spectra of these rings. The topological characterization will be revealed in a
later work. It is noteworthy to point out that we can allow ourself to consider
mostly the minimal prime spectrum of the real ring in order to develop our
topological theories.

(B-V)_0 color, but slower than that is predicted by stellar population
evolution models. It shows that the mean ratio between dark halo and stellar
masses is higher for more ""blue"" galaxies. However some galaxies don't follow
this general trend. The properties of galaxies with extremely high and
extremely low values of M/L_B ratios are compared, and different factors,
accounting for the extremes, are analyzed. The conclusion is that in some cases
too high or too low M/L_B ratios are associated with observational errors, in
other cases - with non-typical dark halo mass fraction, or with peculiarities
of disc stellar population. Particularly, discs of some galaxies with low M/L_B
ratios turn out to be unusually ""light"" for their luminosity and colors, which

Here, we derive Single Stellar Population (SSP)-equivalent ages, metallicities

system of absorption line indices. We systematically compare the indices and
derived parameters for the BCGs with those of large samples of ordinary
elliptical galaxies in the same mass range. We find no significant differences
between the index-velocity dispersion relations of the BCG data and those of
normal ellipticals, but we do find subtle differences between the derived
SSP-parameters. The BCGs show, on average, higher metallicity ([Z/H]) and
alpha-abundance ([E/Fe]) values. We analyse possible correlations between the
derived parameters and the internal properties of the galaxies (velocity
dispersion, rotation, luminosity) and those of the host clusters (density,
mass, distance from BCG to X-ray peak, presence of cooling flows), with the aim
of dissentangling if the BCG properties are more influenced by their internal
or host cluster properties. The SSP-parameters show very little dependence on
the mass or luminosity of the galaxies, or the mass or density of the host
clusters. Of this sample, 26 per cent show luminosity-weighted ages younger
than 6 Gyr, probably a consequence of recent - if small - episodes of star
formation. In agreement with previous studies, the BCGs with intermediate ages
tend to be found in cooling-flow clusters with large X-ray excess.

(and generalisation) of Copenhagen quantum mechanics in the image of classical
stochastic theories. These classical models lend themselves to a simple
interpretation in which a single history (a single element of the sample space)
is deemed to be 'real'; we require only that this real history should not be
ruled out by the dynamics, the axioms of which ensure that not all histories
are precluded. However, applying this interpretation naively to quantum measure
theory we can find experimentally realisable systems (notably the
Peres-Kochen-Specker system) in which every history is ruled out by the
dynamics, challenging us to formulate a deeper realist framework.
  Our first response is to hold on to our existing interpretative framework and
attempt a revision of the dynamics that would reduce quantum measure theory to
a classical dynamics. We explore this approach by examining the histories
formulation of a stochastic-collapse model on a simple (discrete) null-lattice,
concluding that the drawbacks of this approach outweigh the benefits.
  Our second response is to abandon our classically inspired interpretation in
favour of Sorkin's 'co-events', a more general ontology that still allows for
strict realism. In this case the 'potentially real' objects of the theory (the
'beables' in Bell's language) are not individual histories but truth valuation
maps, or co-events. We develop & evaluate various co-event schemes that have
been suggested to date, finally adopting the multiplicative scheme; the current
working model of co-event theory and a promising interpretation of quantum
measure theory, though still a work in progress. We conclude by exploring the
expression of the dynamics & predictions in this new framework.

non-exponential character of backbone structural relaxations. One is attributed
to the collective segmental motions and the other to local relaxations. The
former is well-defined by a single-exponential, nanosecond decay, operative at
all temperatures. The latter is described by a set of processes that display a
distribution of time-scales. Though their average remains on the picosecond
time-scale, the distribution is markedly contracted at the onset of the
transition. The collective motions are shown to impose bounds on time-scales
spanned by local dynamical processes. The piecewise stationary character below
the transition implicates the presence of a collection of sub-states whose
interactions are restricted. At these temperatures, a wide distribution of
local motion time-scales, extending beyond that of nanoseconds is observed. At
physiological temperatures, local motions are confined to time-scales faster

multivariate statistics techniques such as clustering, relies heavily on the
correct understanding of the distribution of known classes as point processes
in parameter space. Aims. Our objective is to analyze the correspondence
between the classical stellar variability types and the clusters found in the
distribution of light curve parameters and colour indices of stars in the CoRoT
exoplanet sample. The final aim is to help in the identification on new types
of variability by first identifying the well known variables in the CoRoT
sample. Methods. We apply unsupervised classification algorithms to identify
clusters of variable stars from modes of the probability density distribution.
We use reference variability databases (Hipparcos and OGLE) as a framework to
calibrate the clustering methodology. Furthermore, we use the results from
supervised classification methods to interpret the resulting clusters.
Results.We interpret the clusters in the Hipparcos and OGLE LMC databases in
terms of large-amplitude radial pulsators in the classical instability strip
and of various types of eclipsing binaries. The Hipparcos data also provide
clear distributions for low-amplitude nonradial pulsators. We show that the
preselection of targets for the CoRoT exoplanet programme results in a
completely different probability density landscape than the OGLE data, the
interpretation of which involves mainly classes of low-amplitude variability in
main-sequence stars. Our findings will be incorporated to improve the
supervised classification used in the CoRoT catalogue production, once the
existence of new classes or subtypes will be confirmed from complementary
spectroscopic observations.

coupled Quark Gluon Plasma (sQGP), a new state of nuclear matter with partonic
degrees of freedom. Theory predicts how transitions to this sQGP depend on the
baryon chemical potential, mu_B, and temperature, T. At low mu_B and high T a
cross-over transition occurs. At high mu_B and low T the transition is of first
order. Hence, at intermediate values, a critical point should occur.
Experimentally we can vary these initial conditions by altering the beam
energy. Thus a beam energy scan (BES) will allow us to explore the QCD phase
diagram close to the QGP-hadron gas boundary and locate such key ""landmarks"" as
the critical point. Establishing the existence of this critical point would be
a seminal step forwards for QCD physics. I discuss below the physics case for a
BES, and explain why RHIC and the STAR experiment are ideally designed for such
a program.

regions of flavors and colors which can yield a physical infrared fixed point.
As a consistency check we recover the previously investigated conformal windows
bounds when restricting to a single matter representation. The earlier
conformal windows can be imagined to be part now of the new conformal house. We
predict the nonperturbative anomalous dimensions at the infrared fixed points.
We further investigate the effects of adding mass terms to the condensates on
the conformal house chiral dynamics and construct the simplest instanton
induced effective Lagrangian terms.
