We present the corresponding metric that solves the Einstein equation coupled
with a massive vector field. We find that, within the class of metric we study,
when we assume the Galilean invariance, the scale invariant deformation always
preserves the non-relativistic conformal invariance. We discuss applications to
scaling regime of Reggeon field theory and non-linear quantum finance. These
theories possess scale invariance but may or may not break the conformal

cluster, Abell 1689, from deep Chandra observations with a total exposure of
200 ks. Within r=200 h-1 kpc, the X-ray mass estimate is systematically lower
than that of lensing by 30-50%. At r>200 h-1 kpc, the mass density profiles
from X-ray and weak lensing methods give consistent results. The most recent
weak lensing work suggest a steeper profile than what is found from the X-ray
analysis, while still in agreement with the mass at large radii. Previous
studies have suggested that cooler small-scale structures can bias X-ray
temperature measurements or that the northern part of the cluster is disturbed.
We find these scenarios unlikely to resolve the central mass discrepancy since
the former requires 70-90% of the space to be occupied by these cool structures
and excluding the northern substructure does not significantly affect the total
mass profiles. A more plausible explanation is a projection effect. We also
find that the previously reported high hard-band to broad-band temperature
ratio in A1689, and many other clusters observed with Chandra, may be resulting
from the instrumental absorption that decreases 10-15% of the effective area at
~1.75 keV.

gravity such as Brans-Dicke and massive graviton theories with LISA. We
consider inspiral gravitational waves from a compact binary composed of a
neutron star (NS) and an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) in Brans-Dicke
(BD) theory and that composed of 2 super massive black holes (SMBHs) in massive
graviton theories. We use the restricted 2PN waveforms including the effects of
spins. We also take both precession and eccentricity of the orbit into account.
For simplicity, we set the fiducial value for the spin of one of the binary
constituents to zero so that we can apply the approximation called
\textit{simple precession}. We perform the Monte Carlo simulations of $10^4$
binaries, estimating the determination accuracy of binary parameters including
the BD parameter $\omega_{\mathrm{BD}}$ and the Compton wavelength of graviton
$\lambda_g$ for each binary using the Fisher matrix method. We find that
including both the spin-spin coupling $\sigma$ and the eccentricity $e$ into
the binary parameters reduces the determination accuracy by an order of
magnitude for the Brans-Dicke case, whilst it has less influence on massive
graviton theories. On the other hand, including precession enhances the
constraint on $\omega_{\mathrm{BD}}$ only 20$%$ but it increases the constraint
on $\lambda_g$ by an order of magnitude. Using a $(1.4+1000)M_{\odot}$ NS/BH
binary of SNR=$\sqrt{200}$, one can put a constraint
$\omega_{\mathrm{BD}}>6944$, whilst using a $(10^7+10^6)M_{\odot}$ BH/BH binary
at 3Gpc, one can put $\lambda_g>3.06\times10^{21}$cm, on average. The latter is
4 orders of magnitude stronger than the one obtained from the solar system
experiment. These results indicate that the effects of precession and
eccentricity must be taken carefully in the parameter estimation analysis.

Galactic Center observed by WMAP, known as the WMAP Haze, may be the
synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons and positrons produced in dark
matter annihilations. In particular, the angular distribution, spectrum, and
intensity of the observed emission are consistent with the signal expected to
result from a WIMP with an electroweak-scale mass and an annihilation cross
section near the value predicted for a thermal relic. Here we revisit this
signal within the context of supersymmetry and evaluate the parameter space of
the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. We find that over much
of the supersymmetric parameter space the lightest neutralino is predicted to
possess the properties required to generate the WMAP Haze. In particular, the
focus point, A-funnel, and bulk regions typically predict a neutralino with a
mass, annihilation cross section, and dominant annihilation modes that are
within the range required to produce the observed features of the WMAP Haze.
The stau-coannihilation region, in contrast, is disfavored as an explanation
for the origin of this signal. If the WMAP Haze is indeed produced by
annihilating neutralinos, prospects for future detection seem promising.

described by a sets of states and set of outcomes, and a rich set of acts,
which are functions from states to outcomes over which the decision maker (DM)
has preferences. Most interesting decision problems, however, do not come with
a state space and an outcome space. Indeed, in complex problems it is often far
from clear what the state and outcome spaces would be. We present an
alternative foundation for decision making, in which the primitive objects of
choice are syntactic programs. A representation theorem is proved in the spirit
of standard representation theorems, showing that if the DM's preference
relation on objects of choice satisfies appropriate axioms, then there exist a
set S of states, a set O of outcomes, a way of interpreting the objects of
choice as functions from S to O, a probability on S, and a utility function on
O, such that the DM prefers choice a to choice b if and only if the expected
utility of a is higher than that of b. Thus, the state space and outcome space
are subjective, just like the probability and utility; they are not part of the
description of the problem. In principle, a modeler can test for SEU behavior
without having access to states or outcomes. We illustrate the power of our
approach by showing that it can capture decision makers who are subject to
framing effects.

transits are presented here from the University of Arizona's 61-inch Kuiper

brightening anomaly was detected during the first half of the transit on May 12
and again in the second half of the transit on May 15th. We conclude that this
is a tentative detection of a r greater than or equal to 6 earth radii starspot
rotating on the surface of the star. We suggest that all evidence to date
suggest TrES-1 has a spotty surface and there is no need to introduce a second
transiting planet in this system to explain these anomalies. We are only able
to constrain the rotational period of the star to 40.2 +22.9 -14.6 days, due to
previous errors in measuring the alignment of the stellar spin axis with the
planetary orbital axis. This is consistent with the previously observed P_obs =
33.2 +22.3 -14.3 day period. We note that this technique could be applied to
other transiting systems for which starspots exist on the star in the transit
path of the planet in order to constrain the rotation rate of the star.

question how life's diversity has evolved, phylogenetic networks have now
joined phylogenetic trees in the center of phylogenetics research. Like
phylogenetic trees, such networks canonically induce collections of
phylogenetic trees, clusters, and triplets, respectively. Thus it is not
surprising that many network approaches aim to reconstruct a phylogenetic
network from such collections. Related to the well-studied perfect phylogeny
problem, the following question is of fundamental importance in this context:
When does one of the above collections encode (i.e. uniquely describe) the
network that induces it? In this note, we present a complete answer to this
question for the special case of a level-1 (phylogenetic) network by
characterizing those level-1 networks for which an encoding in terms of one (or
equivalently all) of the above collections exists. Given that this type of
network forms the first layer of the rich hierarchy of level-k networks, k a
non-negative integer, it is natural to wonder whether our arguments could be
extended to members of that hierarchy for higher values for k. By giving
examples, we show that this is not the case.

tools for the continuous problem. After a brief introduction to finite element
methods, the discretization methods we consider, we develop an abstract Hilbert
space framework for analyzing stability and convergence. In this framework, the
differential complex is represented by a complex of Hilbert spaces and
stability is obtained by transferring Hodge theoretic structures from the
continuous level to the discrete. We show stable discretization is achieved if
the finite element spaces satisfy two hypotheses: they form a subcomplex and
there exists a bounded cochain projection from the full complex to the
subcomplex. Next, we consider the most canonical example of the abstract
theory, in which the Hilbert complex is the de Rham complex of a domain in
Euclidean space. We use the Koszul complex to construct two families of finite
element differential forms, show that these can be arranged in subcomplexes of
the de Rham complex in numerous ways, and for each construct a bounded cochain
projection. The abstract theory therefore applies to give the stability and
convergence of finite element approximations of the Hodge Laplacian. Other
applications are considered as well, especially to the equations of elasticity.

mining problem due to its wide applications to real world time dependent
databases. Sequential patterns are inter-event patterns ordered over a
time-period associated with specific objects under study. Analysis and
discovery of frequent sequential patterns over a predetermined time-period are
interesting data mining results, and can aid in decision support in many
enterprise applications. The problem of sequential pattern mining poses
computational challenges as a long frequent sequence contains enormous number
of frequent subsequences. Also useful results depend on the right choice of
event window. In this paper, we have studied the problem of sequential pattern
mining through two perspectives, one the computational aspect of the problem
and the other is incorporation and adjustability of time constraint. We have
used Indiscernibility relation from theory of rough sets to partition the
search space of sequential patterns and have proposed a novel algorithm that
allows previsualization of patterns and allows adjustment of time constraint
prior to execution of mining task. The algorithm Rough Set Partitioning is at
least ten times faster than the naive time constraint based sequential pattern

in all three lines show four distinct components or lobes that are aligned with

also found to follow a clear pattern: redshifted emission in the South and West
and blueshifted emission in the North and East. The morphology and spatial
kinematics of NH$_3$ emission are shown to have strong similarity to that
observed previously in molecular hydrogen emission and CO emission which arise
from the shocked molecular gas. We also find that the higher lying inversion
transition NH$_3$ (2,2) and (3,3) are stronger in the polar direction in
comparison to the lower transition NH$_3$ (1,1). We conclude that the NH$_3$
emission traces the warm molecular gas, which is shocked and heated by the
interaction between the high velocity outflows and the surrounding envelope.
The presence of strong ammonia emission associated with the shock fronts and
the lack of the emission at the center of the nebula indicate that the
abundance of ammonia is significantly enhanced by shocks, a situation very
similar to that found in outflows from protostars.

We show that the peak flux and the polarization of each pulse are connected
through the orientation of the blob that produces the pulse, while the position
angle fluctuates randomly from one pulse to the next and is constant within an
individual pulse. The most polarized pulses are those with approximately one
tenth the peak flux of the brightest pulse. These conclusions do not depend on
the assumed radiation mechanism nor on the energy and Lorentz factor of the

evolution of galaxies along cosmic history. If massive black holes grow at the
center of (pre-)galactic structures that experience a sequence of merger
episodes, then dual black holes form as inescapable outcome of galaxy assembly.
But, if the black holes reach coalescence, then they become the loudest sources
of gravitational waves ever in the universe. Nature seems to provide a pathway
for the formation of these exotic binaries, and a number of key questions need
to be addressed: How do massive black holes pair in a merger? Depending on the
properties of the underlying galaxies, do black holes always form a close
Keplerian binary? If a binary forms, does hardening proceed down to the domain
controlled by gravitational wave back reaction? What is the role played by gas
and/or stars in braking the black holes, and on which timescale does
coalescence occur? Can the black holes accrete on flight and shine during their
pathway to coalescence? N-Body/hydrodynamical codes have proven to be vital
tools for studying their evolution, and progress in this field is expected to
grow rapidly in the effort to describe, in full realism, the physics of stars
and gas around the black holes, starting from the cosmological large scale of a
merger. If detected in the new window provided by the upcoming gravitational
wave experiments, binary black holes will provide a deep view into the process
of hierarchical clustering which is at the heart of the current paradigm of
galaxy formation. They will also be exquisite probes for testing General
Relativity, as the theory of gravity. The waveforms emitted during the
inspiral, coalescence and ring-down phase carry in their shape the sign of a
dynamically evolving space-time and the proof of the existence of an horizon.

component dominates the formation of structures. Numerical studies of the
formation of CDM halos have produced several robust results that allow unique
tests of the hierarchical clustering paradigm. Universal properties of halos,
including their mass profiles and substructure properties are roughly
consistent with observational data from the scales of dwarf galaxies to galaxy
clusters. Resolving the fine grained structure of halos has enabled us to make
predictions for ongoing and planned direct and indirect dark matter detection
experiments.
  While simulations of pure CDM halos are now very accurate and in good
agreement (recently claimed discrepancies are addressed in detail in this
review), we are still unable to make robust, quantitative predictions about
galaxy formation and about how the dark matter distribution changes in the
process. Whilst discrepancies between observations and simulations have been
the subject of much debate in the literature, galaxy formation and evolution
needs to be understood in more detail in order to fully test the CDM paradigm.
Whatever the true nature of the dark matter particle is, its clustering
properties must not be too different from a cold neutralino like particle to
maintain all the successes of the model in matching large scale structure data
and the global properties of halos which are mostly in good agreement with
observations.

RXJ1131-1231 to measure the sizes of the optical and X-ray emission regions of
the quasar. The (face-on) scale length of the optical disk at rest frame 400 nm
is 1.3 10^15cm, while the half-light radius of the rest frame 0.3-17 keV X-ray
emission is 2.3 10^14cm. The formal uncertainties are factors of 1.6 and 2.0,
respectively. With the exception of the lower limit on the X-ray size, the
results are very stable against any changes in the priors used in the analysis.
Based on the Hbeta line-width, we estimate that the black hole mass is ~10^8
Msun, which corresponds to a gravitational radius of r_g~2 10^13 cm. Thus, the
X-ray emission is emerging on scales of ~10r_g and the 400 nm emission on
scales of ~70 r_g. A standard thin disk of this size should be significantly
brighter than observed. Possible solutions are to have a flatter temperature
profile or to scatter a large fraction of the optical flux on larger scales
after it is emitted. While our calculations were not optimized to constrain the
dark matter fraction in the lens galaxy, dark matter dominated models are
favored. With well-sampled optical and X-ray light curves over a broad range of
frequencies there will be no difficulty in extending our analysis to completely
map the structure of the accretion disk as a function of wavelength.

in focussing both experimental and theoretical research in quantum information
processing. These criteria were formulated specifically for the circuit model
of quantum computing. However, several new models for quantum computing
(paradigms) have been proposed that do not seem to fit the criteria well. The
question is therefore what are the general criteria for implementing quantum
computers. To this end, a formal operational definition of a quantum computer
is introduced. It is then shown that according to this definition a device is a
quantum computer if it obeys the following four criteria: Any quantum computer
must (1) have a quantum memory; (2) facilitate a controlled quantum evolution
of the quantum memory; (3) include a method for cooling the quantum memory; and
(4) provide a readout mechanism for subsets of the quantum memory. The criteria
are met when the device is scalable and operates fault-tolerantly. We discuss
various existing quantum computing paradigms, and how they fit within this
framework. Finally, we lay out a roadmap for selecting an avenue towards
building a quantum computer. This is summarized in a decision tree intended to
help experimentalists determine the most natural paradigm given a particular
physical implementation.

to rotate the spin of the incident carriers in a controlled way.

deviate by (-2, -1, 0, +1, +2)sigma from the cosmic mean, where sigma is the
rms mass fluctuation on a scale of ~20Mpc/h at z=1.5. The simulations have mass
resolution of up to 10^6 Msun/h, cover the entire range of large-scale
environments and allow extrapolation of statistics to the entire 500 (Mpc/h)^3
Millennium volume. They include gas cooling, photoheating from an ionising
background, SNe feedback and winds, but no AGN. We find that the specific SFR
density at z <~ 10 varies systematically from region to region by up to an
order of magnitude, but the global value, averaged over all volumes, reproduces
observational data. Massive, compact galaxies, similar to those observed in the
GOODS fields, form in the overdense regions as early as z=6, but do not appear
in the underdense regions until z~3. These environmental variations are not
caused by a dependence of the star formation properties on environment, but
rather by a strong variation of the halo mass function from one environment to
another, with more massive haloes forming preferentially in the denser regions.
At all epochs, stars form most efficiently in haloes of circular velocity ~ 250
km/s. However, the star formation history exhibits a form of ""downsizing"" (even
in the absence of AGN): the stars comprising massive galaxies at z=0 have
mostly formed by z=1-2, whilst those comprising smaller galaxies typically form
at later times. However, additional feedback is required to limit star
formation in massive galaxies at late times.

sensitive to details such as whether regions of a semiconducting armchair

gap of the semiconducting nanoribbon, but is linked to the valley degree of
freedom. Though we study these effects in the simplest contexts, they can be
expected to occur for more complicated structures, and we show results for
rings as well. We conclude that experience from electron gas waveguides does

simple quantum field theory, which allows us to evaluate the single-photon
absorption efficiency for one and many absorber setups. As an example, we
consider a particular design that combines a coplanar coaxial waveguide with
superconducting phase qubits, a natural but not exclusive playground for
experimental implementations. This work and a possible experimental realization

radial velocity curves of the system yielded component masses of 0.38 +/- 0.02

than the theoretical models predict for these masses, in agreement with the
results for existing eclipsing binaries, although the present 5% observational
uncertainties limit the significance of the larger radii to approximately 1
sigma. Degeneracies in the light curve models resulting from the unknown
configuration of surface spots on the components of GJ 3236 currently dominate
the uncertainties in the radii, and could be reduced by obtaining precise,
multi-band photometry covering the full orbital period. The system appears to
be tidally synchronized and shows signs of high activity levels as expected for
such a short orbital period, evidenced by strong Halpha emission lines in the
spectra of both components. These observations probe an important region of

understand conditions in the early Solar System. Unlike larger planetary bodies
that were subject to global thermal modification during and subsequent to their
formation, these small bodies have kept at least some unmodified primordial
material from the solar nebula. However, the structural properties of asteroids
have been modified considerably since their formation. Thus, we can find among
them a great variety of physical configurations and dynamical histories. In
fact, with only a few possible exceptions, all asteroids have been modified or
completely disrupted many times during the age of the Solar System. This
picture is supported by data from space mission encounters with asteroids that
show much diversity of shape, bulk density, surface morphology, and other
features. Moreover, the gravitational attraction of these bodies is so small
that some physical processes occur in a manner far removed from our common
experience on Earth. Thus, each visit to a small body has generated as many
questions as it has answered. In this review we discuss the current state of
research into asteroid disruption processes, focusing on collisional and
rotational mechanisms. We find that recent advances in modeling catastrophic
disruption by collisions have provided important insights into asteroid
internal structures and a deeper understanding of asteroid families. Rotational
disruption, by tidal encounters or thermal effects, is responsible for altering
many smaller asteroids, and is at the origin of many binary asteroids and oddly
shaped bodies.

particular emphasis on the interaction of dynamical and geochemical models. The
lifetime of gas around stars in the process of formation is limited to a few
million years based on astronomical observations, while isotopic dating of
meteorites and the Earth-Moon system suggest that perhaps 50-100 million years
were required for the assembly of the Earth. Therefore, much of the growth of
the terrestrial planets in our own system is presumed to have taken place under
largely gas-free conditions, and the physics of terrestrial planet formation is
dominated by gravitational interactions and collisions. The earliest phase of
terrestrial-planet formation involve the growth of km-sized or larger
planetesimals from dust grains, followed by the accumulations of these
planetesimals into ~100 lunar- to Mars-mass bodies that are initially
gravitationally isolated from one-another in a swarm of smaller planetesimals,
but eventually grow to the point of significantly perturbing one-another. The
mutual perturbations between the embryos, combined with gravitational stirring
by Jupiter, lead to orbital crossings and collisions that drive the growth to
Earth-sized planets on a timescale of 10-100 million years. Numerical treatment
of this process has focussed on the use of symplectic integrators which can
rapidly integrate the thousands of gravitationally-interacting bodies necessary
to accurately model planetary growth. While the general nature of the
terrestrial planets--their sizes and orbital parameters--seem to be broadly
reproduced by the models, there are still some outstanding dynamical issues.
One of these is the presence of an embryo-sized body, Mars, in our system in
place of the more massive objects that simulations tend to yield. [Abridged]

clusters, such as X-ray scaling relations, radial profiles of entropy and
density of the intracluster gas, and radial distribution of galaxies are
reproduced quite well. In particular, the outer regions of cluster at radii
beyond about 10 per cent of the virial radius are quite regular and exhibit
scaling with mass remarkably close to that expected in the simplest case in
which only the action of gravity determines the evolution of the intra-cluster
gas. However, simulations generally fail at reproducing the observed cool-core
structure of clusters: simulated clusters generally exhibit a significant
excess of gas cooling in their central regions, which causes an overestimate of
the star formation and incorrect temperature and entropy profiles. The total
baryon fraction in clusters is below the mean universal value, by an amount
which depends on the cluster-centric distance and the physics included in the
simulations, with interesting tensions between observed stellar and gas
fractions in clusters and predictions of simulations. Besides their important
implications for the cosmological application of clusters, these puzzles also
point towards the important role played by additional physical processes,
beyond those already included in the simulations. We review the role played by
these processes, along with the difficulty for their implementation, and
discuss the outlook for the future progress in numerical modeling of clusters.

few times 0.1 eV to a few times 0.01 eV. It is shown that this conclusion is
not changed even when scale invariance is broken and is in fact relatively

Supernovae Type Ia (SN Ia) that utilizes 2-d simulations to implement a form of
the deflagration-detonation transition (DDT) explosion scenario. The framework
is developed from a randomized initial condition that leads to a sample of
simulated SN Ia whose Ni56 masses have a similar average and range to those
observed, and have many other modestly realistic features such as the velocity
extent of intermediate mass elements. The intended purpose is to enable
statistically well-defined studies of both physical and theoretical parameters
of the SN Ia explosion simulation. We present here a thorough description of
the outcome of the SN Ia explosions produced by our current simulations. A
first application of this framework is utilized to study the dependence of the
SN Ia on the Ne22 content, which is known to be directly influenced by the
progenitor stellar population's metallicity. Our study is very specifically
tailored to measure how the Ne22 content influences the competition between the
rise of plumes of burned material and the expansion of the star before these
plumes reach DDT conditions. This competition controls the amount of material
in nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE) and therefore Ni56 produced by setting
the density at which nucleosynthesis takes place during the detonation phase of
the explosion. Although the outcome following from any particular ignition
condition can change dramatically with Ne22 content, with a sample of 20
ignition conditions we find that the systematic change in the expansion of the
star prior to detonation is not large enough to compete with the dependence on

that for barotropic flows (where the pressure depends only on the density),
wave absorption at the corotation resonance can lead to mode growth when the
disc vortensity, $\zeta=\kappa^2/(2\Omega\Sigma)$ (where $\Omega, \kappa,
\Sigma$ are the rotation rate, radial epicyclic frequency and surface density
of the disc, respectively), has a positive gradient at the corotation radius.
Here we generalize the analysis of the corotation resonance effect to
non-barotropic fluids. We show that the mode instability criterion is modified
by the finite radial Brunt-V\""as\""al\""a frequency of the disc. We derive an
analytic expression for the reflectivity when a density wave impinges upon the
corotation barrier, and calculate the frequencies and growth rates of global
p-modes for disc models with various $\alpha$-viscosity parameterizations. We
find that for disc fluids with constant adiabatic index $\Gamma$,
super-reflection and mode growth depend on the gradient of the effective
vortensity, $\zeta_{\rm eff} = \zeta/S^{2/\Gamma}$ (where $S \equiv
P/\Sigma^{\Gamma}$ measures the entropy): when $d\zeta_{\rm eff}/dr > 0$ at the
corotation radius, wave absorption leads to amplification of the p-mode. Our
calculations show that the lowest-order p-modes with azimuthal wave number
$m=2, 3, 4,...$ have the largest growth rates, with the frequencies
approximately in (but distinct from) the $2:3:4...$ commensurate ratios. We

pressure on structures and bands has been investigated extensively within
density-functional based methods, the pressure dependence of electron-electron
interactions has so far received little attention. As a step toward ab initio
pressure studies for realistic systems within a setup of maximally localized
Wannier functions and the constrained random phase approximation, we examine in
this paper the paradigmatic pressure dependence of Coulomb interactions. While
compression commonly causes the ""extension"" of Wannier functions, and thus
transfer elements, to grow, we find the -- seemingly counter-intuitive --
tendency that the bare Coulomb interaction increases under compression as well.
We reconcile these behaviors by appealing to a semi-analytical tight-binding
model. We moreover argue that, for this model, the requirement of maximal
Wannier localization is equivalent to maximizing the Coulomb interaction matrix
elements. We then apply the above first principles techniques to fcc hydrogen
under pressure. While we find our comprehension of the bare Coulomb interaction
confirmed, the induced changes in screening strengths lead to an effective one

coronal jets observed with the SECCHI imaging suites of the two STEREO

simultaneous EUV and white-light coronagraph observations, taken during the
time period March 2007 to April 2008. The appearances of the coronal jets were
always correlated with underlying small-scale chromospheric bright points. A
basic characterisation of the morphology and identification of the presence of
helical structure were established with respect to recently proposed models for
their origin and temporal evolution. A classification of the events with
respect to previous jet studies shows that amongst the 79 events there were 37
Eiffel tower-type jet events commonly interpreted as a small-scale (about 35
arcsec) magnetic bipole reconnecting with the ambient unipolar open coronal
magnetic fields at its looptops, and 12 lambda-type jet events commonly
interpreted as reconnection with the ambient field happening at the bipoles
footpoints. Five events were termed micro-CME type jet events because they
resembled the classical coronal mass ejections (CMEs) but on much smaller
scales. A few jets are also found in equatorial coronal holes. The typical
lifetimes in the SECCHI/EUVI (Extreme UltraViolet Imager) field of view between
1.0 to 1.7 solar radius and in SECCHI/COR1 field of view between 1.4 to 4 solar
radius are obtained, and the derived speed are roughly estimated. In summary,
the observations support the assumption of continuous small-scale reconnection
as an intrinsic feature of the solar corona, with its role for the heating of
the corona, particle acceleration, structuring and acceleration of the solar
wind remaining to be explored in more details in further studies.

a basic problem: the observed boundary data are inconsistent with the nonlinear

conditions on vertical current provided by the data, and the two choices lead
to different force-free solutions. A novel solution to this problem is
described. Bayesian probability is used to modify the boundary values on
current density, using field-line connectivity information from the two

boundary data are more consistent with the two nonlinear force-free solutions.
This procedure may be iterated until a set of self-consistent boundary data

comparing the properties of the turbulent states in simulations having
identical microscopic diffusion coefficients (viscosity and resistivity). We
find the properties of the turbulence do not change when the box size is

Approximation. The numerical value translates into a turbulent magnetic Prandtl
number Pm_t of order unity. Pm_t appears to be an increasing function of the
forcing we impose. It also becomes smaller as the box size is increased in the
radial direction, in good agreement with previous results obtained in very

the regime of early proper-time using the AdS/CFT correspondence. It is shown,
in contrast with the late-time expansion, that a scaling solution does not
exist. The boundary dynamics in this regime depends on initial conditions
encoded in the bulk behavior of a Fefferman-Graham metric coefficient at
initial proper-time. The relation between the early-time expansion of the
energy density and initial conditions in the bulk of AdS is provided. As a
general result it is proven that a singularity of some metric coefficient in

constraints on the possible boundary dynamics. Using a simple Pade resummation

quantum witnesses in the context of the complexity class QMA, the quantum
analogue of NP. The natural way to quantify the number of quantum witnesses is
the dimension of the witness subspace W in some appropriate Hilbert space H. We
present an efficient deterministic procedure that reduces any problem where the
dimension d of W is bounded by a polynomial to a problem with a unique quantum
witness. The main idea of our reduction is to consider the Alternating subspace
of the d-th tensor power of H. Indeed, the intersection of this subspace with
the d-th tensor power of W is one-dimensional, and therefore can play the role
of the unique quantum witness.

large structure at z~0.5, the SDSS Great Wall, and a large and very young
structure at z~0.054. These structures account for the mass maps derived from a
recent weak lensing analysis by Gavazzi et al. (2009). The orbits of dwarf
galaxies are probably anisotropic and radial, and could originate from field
galaxies radially falling into the cluster. Spectral characteristics of Coma
dwarf galaxies show that red or absorption line galaxies have larger stellar
masses and are older than blue or emission line galaxies. R<22 galaxies show
less prominent absorption lines than R>22 galaxies. This trend is less clear
for field galaxies, suggesting that part of the faint Coma galaxies could have
been recently injected from the field following the NGC 4911 group infall. We
present a list of five Ultra Compact Dwarf galaxy candidates. We also globally

the Oslo Staggered Code (OSC) to solve the full MHD equations with non-grey and
non-LTE radiative transfer and thermal conduction along the magnetic field
lines. We find a multitude of features that show a spatiotemporal evolution
that is similar to that observed in type i spicules, which are characterized by
parabolic height vs. time profiles, and are dominated by rapid upward motion at
speeds of 10-30 km/s, followed by downward motion at similar velocities. We
measured the parameters of the parabolic profile of the spicules and find
similar correlations between the parameters as those found in observations. The
values for height (or length) and duration of the spicules found in the
simulations are more limited in range than those in the observations. The
spicules found in the simulation with higher preexisting ambient field have
shorter length and smaller velocities. From the simulations, it appears that
these kinds of spicules can, in principle, be driven by a variety of mechanisms

takes into account the effect of ordered and random angular momentum, dynamical

on galactic scales (normal and dwarfs spiral galaxies) and on clusters of
galaxies scales. Our analysis suggest that angular momentum and dynamical
friction are able, on galactic scales, to overcome the competing effect of
adiabatic contraction eliminating the cusp. The slope of density profile of
inner haloes flattens with decreasing halo mass and the profile is well
approximated by a Burkert's profile. In order to obtain the NFW profile,
starting from the profiles obtained from our model, the magnitude of angular
momentum and dynamical friction must be reduced with respect to the values
predicted by the model itself. The rotation curves of four LSB galaxies from
Gentile et al. (2004) are compared to the rotation curves obtained by the model
in the present paper obtaining a good fit to the observational data. The time
evolution of the density profile of a galaxy of $10^8-10^9 M_{\odot}$ shows
that after a transient steepening, due to the adiabatic contraction, the
density profile flattens to $\alpha \simeq 0$. On cluster scales we observe a
similar evolution of the dark matter density profile but in this case the
density profile slope flattens to $\alpha \simeq 0.6$ for a cluster of $\simeq

of the physical mechanisms that govern stellar birth is a prerequisite for
understanding the formation and evolution of our galactic home, the Milky Way.
A theory of star formation is an essential part of any model for the origin of
our solar system and of planets around other stars. Despite this pivotal
importance, and despite many decades of research, our understanding of the
processes that initiate and regulate star formation is still limited.
  Stars are born in cold interstellar clouds of molecular hydrogen gas. Star
formation in these clouds is governed by the complex interplay between the
gravitational attraction in the gas and agents such as turbulence, magnetic
fields, radiation and thermal pressure that resist compression. The competition
between these processes determines both the locations at which young stars form
and how much mass they ultimately accrete. It plays out over many orders of
magnitude in space and time, ranging from galactic to stellar scales. In
addition, star formation is a highly stochastic process in which rare and
hard-to-predict events, such as the formation of very massive stars and the
resulting feedback, can play a dominant role in determining the evolution of a
star-forming cloud.
  As a consequence of the wide range of scales and processes that control star
formation, analytic models are usually restricted to highly idealized cases.
These can yield insight, but the complexity of the problem means that they must
be used in concert with large-scale numerical simulations. Here we summarize
the state of modern star formation theory and review the recent advances in
numerical simulation techniques.

recently explained by Kuepper et al. (2008). Standing waves develop in the
tidal arms. The wave knots or clumps develop at the position, where the
emerging tidal arm hits the potential wall of the effective potential and is
reflected. The escaping stars move through the wave knots further into the
tidal arms. We show the consistency of the positions of the wave knots with the
theory in Just et al. (2009). We also demonstrate a simple method to study the
properties of tidal arms. By solving many eigenvalue problems along the tidal
arms, we construct numerically a 1D coordinate system whose direction is always
along a principal axis of the local tensor of inertia. Along this coordinate
system, physical quantities can be evaluated. The half-mass or dissolution
times of our models are almost independent of the particle number which
indicates that two-body relaxation is not the dominant mechanism leading to the
dissolution. This may be a typical situation for many young star clusters. We
propose a classification scheme which sheds light on the dissolution mechanism.

between the formation of the stellar cluster and the explosion of the first
massive stars and the consequent formation of supernova remnants and high mass
X-ray binaries (HMXB) which originate the radio and hard X-ray fluxes
respectively. When comparing hard X-rays with a star formation indicator that
traces the first million years of evolution (e.g. Ha luminosities) we found a

X-ray luminosities are compared with infrared luminosities, a star formation
tracer that represents an average over the last 10^8 years. The results support

group $Symp(M,\omega)$ of $(M,\omega)$. On the other hand, $(M,\omega)$ is
determined by the associated moment polytope $P$ by the result of Delzant.
Therefore, the group $G$ should be estimated in terms of $P$ or we may say that

  Non-control Data Attacks",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Memory corruption attacks remain the primary threat for computer security.
Information flow tracking or taint analysis has been proven to be effective
against most memory corruption attacks. However, there are two shortcomings
with current taint analysis based techniques. First, these techniques cause
application slowdown by about 76% thereby limiting their practicality. Second,
these techniques cannot handle non-control data attacks i.e., attacks that do
not overwrite control data such as return address, but instead overwrite
critical application configuration data or user identity data. In this work, to
address these problems, we describe a coarse-grained taint analysis technique
that uses information flow tracking at the level of application data objects.
We propagate a one-bit taint over each application object that is modified by
untrusted data thereby reducing the taint management overhead considerably. We
performed extensive experimental evaluation of our approach and show that it
can detect all critical attacks such as buffer overflows, and format string
attacks, including non-control data attacks. Unlike the currently known
approaches that can detect such a wide range of attacks, our approach does not
require the source code or any hardware extensions. Run-time performance
overhead evaluation shows that, on an average, our approach causes application
slowdown by only 37% which is an order of magnitude improvement over existing
approaches. Finally, since our approach performs run-time binary
instrumentation, it is easier to integrate it with existing applications and
systems.

contact interface propagate in the shocked media and cause nonlinear

conservatively estimate the overdensity in redshift space for the spike,

of 500 km/s. A map of the surface density of galaxies at z=1.6 in the GMASS
field shows that its structure is irregular. The differences in the physical
properties of Cl 0332-2742 member and field galaxies agree with the latest
hierarchical galaxy formation models: for overdensity members, the star
formation rate (SFR), and specific SFR, is approximately 50% lower than for the
field galaxies; overdensity galaxies are twice the age, on average, of field
galaxies; and there is a higher proportion of both massive (M>10^{10.7} M_sol),
and early-type galaxies, inside Cl 0332-2742 than in the field. Among the 42
members, 7 have spectra consistent with being passively evolving, massive
galaxies. In a z-J colour-magnitude diagram, the photometric data of these
early-type galaxies are in close agreement with a theoretical red sequence of a
galaxy cluster at redshift z=1.6, which formed most of its stars in a short
burst of star formation at z~3. We conclude that the redshift spike at z=1.6 in
the GMASS field represents a sheet-like structure in the cosmic web and the
area with the highest surface density within this structure, containing already
seven passively evolving galaxies, will evolve into a cluster of galaxies at a
later time.

geometrical optics, but not in wave optics. Here we analyze, both analytically

the cloaking device performs remarkably well even in a regime beyond
geometrical optics where the device is comparable in size with the wavelength.
In particular, the cloak is nearly perfect for a spectrum of frequencies that
are related to spherical harmonics. We also show that for increasing wavenumber
the device works increasingly better, approaching perfect behavior in the limit

  We make the following contributions.
  First, we provide interpolation procedures for several basic theories of
interest: the theories of linear arithmetic over the rationals, difference
logic over rationals and integers, and UTVPI over rationals and integers.
  Second, we define a novel approach to interpolate combinations of theories,
that applies to the Delayed Theory Combination approach.
  Efficiency is ensured by the fact that the proposed interpolation algorithms
extend state of the art algorithms for Satisfiability Modulo Theories. Our

quartic term in the Yang-Mills field strength. We obtain analytically a class
of cosmological solutions in which the extra dimensions are static and the
scale factor of the four-dimensional Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric
is an exponential function of time. This means that the model can explain
inflation. Then we look for solutions that describe dynamical compactification
of the extra dimensions. The effective cosmological constant $\lambda_1$ in the
four-dimensional universe is determined from the gravitational coupling,
ten-dimensional cosmological constant, gauge coupling and higher derivative
coupling. By numerical integration, the solution with $\lambda_1=0$ is found to
behave as a matter-dominated universe which asymptotically approaches flat
space-time, while the solution with a non-vanishing $\lambda_1$ approaches de
Sitter space-time in the asymptotic future.

intermediate-masses experience mixing of hydrogen into the helium convection
during the early TP-AGB phase, differently from the meal-rich stars. We study
the nucleosynthesis in the helium convective zone with 13C formed from mixed
protons as neutron source by using a nuclear network from H through S. In the
absence or scarcity of the pristine metals, the neutron-recycling reactions,
12C(n,g)13C(a,n)16O and also 16O(n,g)17O(a,n)20Ne promote the synthesis of O
and light elements, including their neutron-rich isotopes and the odd atomic
number elements. Based on the results, we demonstrate that the peculiar
abundance patterns of C through Al observed for the three most iron-deficient,
carbon-rich stars can be reproduced in terms of the nucleosynthesis in Pop.
III, AGB stars in the different mass range. We argue that these three stars
were born as the low-mass members of Pop. III binaries and later subject to the
surface pollution by the mass transfer in the binary systems. It is also shown
that the AGB nucleosynthesis with hydrogen mixing explains the abundances of C,
O, Na, Mg and Al observed for most of carbon-enhanced EMP (CEMP) stars,
including all CEMP-s stars with s-process elements. In addition the present
results are used to single out other nucleosynthetic signatures of early
generations of stars.

Coulomb barrier is investigated in the framework of a microscopic stochastic
mean-field theory. While mean-field alone is known to significantly
underpredict the dispersion of the fragment mass distribution, a considerable
enhancement of the dispersion is obtained in the stochastic mean-field theory.
The variance of the fragment mass distribution deduced from the stochastic
theory scales with the number of exchanged nucleon. Therefore, the new approach
provides the first fully microscopic theory consistent with the
phenomenological analysis of the experimental data.

spanning-hyperforest model of the k-uniform complete hypergraph for any k>= 2.
The case k=2 reduces to the spanning-forest model on the complete graph.
Different k are studied at once by using a microcanonical ensemble in which the
number of hyperforests is fixed. The low-temperature phase is characterized by
the appearance of a giant hyperforest. The phase transition occurs when the
number of hyperforests is a fraction (k-1)/k of the total number of vertices.
The behaviour at criticality is also studied by means of the coalescence of two
saddle points. As the Grassmann formulation exhibits a global supersymmetry we
show that the phase transition is second order and is associated to
supersymmetry breaking and we explore the pure thermodynamical phase at low
temperature by introducing an explicit breaking field.
