physical evolution in Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC) in the absence of the
massless scalar field which has been used so far in the literature as an
internal time. In order to retrieve the system dynamics when no such a suitable
clock field is present, we explore different constructions of families of
unitarily related partial observables. These observables are parameterized,
respectively, by: (i) one of the components of the densitized triad, and (ii)
its conjugate momentum; each of them playing the role of an evolution
parameter. Exploiting the properties of the considered example, we investigate
in detail the domains of applicability of each construction. In both cases the
observables possess a neat physical interpretation only in an approximate
sense. However, whereas in case (i) such interpretation is reasonably accurate
only for a portion of the evolution of the universe, in case (ii) it remains so
during all the evolution (at least in the physically interesting cases). The
constructed families of observables are next used to describe the evolution of
the Bianchi I universe. The performed analysis confirms the robustness of the
bounces, also in absence of matter fields, as well as the preservation of the
semiclassicality through them. The concept of evolution studied here and the
presented construction of observables are applicable to a wide class of models
in LQC, including quantizations of the Bianchi I model obtained with other
prescriptions for the improved dynamics.

strongest sources of gravitational waves and are potential central engines for
short gamma-ray bursts. Aims: We aim to compare the general relativistic (GR)
results by other groups with Newtonian calculations of models with equivalent
parameters. We vary the mass ratios between NS and BH and the compactness of
the NS. The mass of the NS is 1.4 M_sol. We compare the dynamics in the
parameter-space regions where the NS is expected to reach the innermost stable
circular orbit (ISCO) before being tidally disrupted (mass shedding, MS) and
vice versa. Methods: The hydrodynamics is evolved by a Newtonian PPM scheme
with four levels of nested grids. We use a polytropic EoS (Gamma=2), as was
done in the GR simulations. However, instead of full GR we use a Newtonian
potential supplemented by a Paczynski-Wiita-Artemova potential for the BH, both
disregarding and including rotation of the BH. Results: If the NS is compact
(C=0.18) it is accreted by the BH more quickly, and only a small amount of mass
remains outside the BH. If the mass ratio is small (Q=2 or 3) or the NS is less
compact (C=0.16 or less) the NS is tidally torn apart before being accreted.
Although most of the mass is absorbed by the BH, some 0.1 M_sol remain in a
tidal arm. For small mass ratios the tidal arm can wrap around the BH to form a
thick disk. When including the effects of BH spin-up or spin-down by the
accreted matter, more mass remains in the surroundings (0.2-0.3 M_sol).
Conclusions: Although details and quantitative results differ, the general
trends of our Newtonian calculations are similar to the GR calculations. A
clear delimiting line that separates ISCO from the MS cases is not found.
Inclusion of BH rotation as well as sufficient numerical resolution are
extremely important.

over large sky areas in the near-UV band are important because they are
difficult to obtain given the low efficiency of near-UV instrumentation, even
at 8m class telescopes. A large instrumental field of view helps in minimizing
the biases due to the cosmic variance. We have obtained deep images in the

~0.4 sq. deg. the galaxy number counts down to U=27 in the Vega system

reaching the faintest current limit for this wavelength and sky area. The shape
of the galaxy counts in the U band can be described by a double power-law, the
bright side being consistent with the shape of shallower surveys of comparable
or greater areas. The slope bends over significantly at U>23.5 ensuring the
convergence of the contribution by star forming galaxies to the EBL in the

principles in physics, is introduced in the shape extraction of the active
contours. The objectives of adopting this concept are to address the several
major difficulties in the application of Active Contours. Primarily, a
technique is developed to realize the topological changes of Parametric Active
Contours (Snakes). The key strategy is to imitate the process of a balloon
expanding and filling in a closed space with several objects. After removing
the touched balloon surfaces, the objects can be identified by surrounded
remaining balloon surfaces. A burned region swept by Snakes is utilized to
trace the contour and to give a criterion for stopping the movement of Snake
curve. When the Snakes terminates evolution totally, through ignoring this
criterion, it can form a connected area by evolving the Snakes again and
continuing the region burning. The contours extracted from the boundaries of
the burned area can represent the child snake of each object respectively.
Secondly, a novel scheme is designed to solve the problems of leakage of the
contour from the large gaps, and the segmentation error in Geometric Active
Contours (GAC). It divides the segmentation procedure into two processing
stages. By simulating the wave propagating in the isotropic substance at the
final stage, it can significantly enhance the effect of image force in GAC
based on Level Set and give the satisfied solutions to the two problems.
Thirdly, to support the physical models for active contours above, we introduce
a general image force field created on a template plane over the image plane.
This force is more adaptable to noisy images with complicated geometric shapes.

Besides the traditional goal of predicting `who likes what?', a conference
management system must take into account aspects such as: reviewer capacity
constraints, adequate numbers of reviews for papers, expertise modeling,
conflicts of interest, and an overall distribution of assignments that balances
reviewer preferences with conference objectives. Among these, issues of
modeling preferences and tastes in reviewing have traditionally been studied
separately from the optimization of paper-reviewer assignment. In this paper,
we present an integrated study of both these aspects. First, due to the paucity
of data per reviewer or per paper (relative to other recommender systems
applications) we show how we can integrate multiple sources of information to
learn paper-reviewer preference models. Second, our models are evaluated not
just in terms of prediction accuracy but in terms of the end-assignment
quality. Using a linear programming-based assignment optimization formulation,
we show how our approach better explores the space of unsupplied assignments to
maximize the overall affinities of papers assigned to reviewers. We demonstrate
our results on real reviewer preference data from the IEEE ICDM 2007

the Standard Model, with a gauge-singlet boson coupled to sterile neutrinos,
can provide a consistent framework for the theory of neutrino masses, and can
produce relic keV sterile neutrinos via decays of the singlet Higgs. This
mechanism operates around the electroweak scale, and has interesting
consequences for the electroweak phase transition. The resulting dark matter is
""colder"" than the one produced via oscillations. This property changes the
small-scale structure formation limits. Heavier sterile neutrinos can be

that all terms necessary for non-leading logarithms are taken into account. In

luminosities, and stellar populations in large structures at higher redshift,
we have investigated two sheet-like structures of galaxies at z=0.8 and 1.3

at least 200 h^-1 Mpc. We present first results of an analysis of these

cross-correlated with optical data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We
derive a sample of 462 Lyman Break Galaxy (LBG) candidates coincident with the

spectral energy distribution of a LBG galaxy at z~1 is flat (in f_lambda) in
the rest frame wavelength range from 1500A, to 4000A, implying evolved
populations of stars in the LBGs. From the luminosity functions we get
indications for overdensities in the two LQGs compared to their foreground

formation is actively ongoing. We are interested in accreting pre-main sequence
variables whose luminosity variations are due to intermittent events of disk
accretion (i.e. active T Tauri stars and EXor type objects). The variable
objects have been selected from a catalog of more than 170,000 sources detected
at a S/N ratio > 5. We searched the sample of variables for ones whose
photometric properties are close to those of known EXor's. These latter are
monitored in a more systematic way than T Tauri stars and the mechanisms that
regulate the observed phenomenology are exactly the same. Hence the modalities
of the EXor behavior is adopted as driving criterium for selecting variables in
general. We selected 19 bona fide candidates that constitute a well-defined
sample of new variable targets for further investigation. Out of these, 10
sources present a Spitzer MIPS 24 micron counterpart, and have been classified
as 3 Class I, 5 flat spectrum and 2 Class II objects, while the other 9 sources
have spectral energy distribution compatible with phases older than Class I.
This is consistent with what is known about the small sample of known EXor's,

identify many spectral features, measure the Doppler velocities, and discuss
the chemical distribution of explosion products in SNe Ia. We describe
procedures for smoothing data, fitting continua, and measuring absorption
features to insure consistency for measurement and analysis.
  This sample provides the first opportunity to examine and compare a large
number of SNe Ia in this wavelength region. NIR data are a rich source of
information about explosion products whose signatures are blended or obscured
in other spectral regions and NIR observations probe a greater radial depth
than optical wavelengths. We analyze similarities and differences in the
spectra and we show that the progressive development of spectral features for
normal SNe Ia in the NIR is consistent with time.
  Measured Doppler velocities indicate that burning products in SNe Ia are
distributed in distinct layers with no large scale mixing. Carbon is not
detected in these data, in agreement with previous results with NIR data
establishing very low limits on carbon abundance in SNe Ia. Carbon burning
products, O and Mg, are plentiful in the outer layers suggesting that the
entire progenitor is burned in the explosion. The data provide a resource for
investigations of cross-correlations with other data libraries that may further
constrain SN Ia physics and improve the effectiveness of SNe Ia as cosmological

literally and study the shape and motion of a bump, wrinkle or ruck in a thin
sheet in partial contact with a rough substrate in a gravitational field. Using
a combination of experiments, scaling analysis and numerical solutions of the
governing equations, we first quantify the static shape of a ruck on a
horizontal plane. When the plane is inclined, the ruck becomes asymmetric and
moves by rolling only when the the inclination of the plane reaches a critical
angle. We find that the angle at which this first occurs is larger than the
angle at which the ruck stops, i.e. static rolling friction is larger than
dynamic rolling friction. Once the ruck is in motion, it travels at a constant
speed proportional to the sine of the angle of inclination, a result that we
rationalize in terms of a simple power balance. We conclude with a simple
implication of our study for the onset of rolling motion at soft interfaces.

baseline. The cross-correlation functions show that the density distribution of
neighbours is almost identical for blue galaxies, either active, or non-active.
Although active red galaxies inhabit environments less dense compared to
non-active red galaxies, both reside in environments considerably denser than
those of blue hosts. Moreover, the radial density profile of AGN, relative to
galaxy group centres is less concentrated than galaxies. This is particularly
evident when comparing red AGN and non-active galaxies.
  The properties of the neighbouring galaxies of blue and red AGN and non
active galaxies reflect this effect. While the neighbourhood of the blue
samples is indistinguishable, the red AGN environs show an excess of blue-star
forming galaxies with respect to their non-active counterpart. On the other
hand, the active and non-active blue systems have similar environments but
markedly different morphological distributions, showing an excess of blue
early-type AGN, which are argued to be late stage mergers. This comparison
reveals that the observable differences between active red and blue host galaxy
properties including star formation history and AGN activity depends on the

activities and/or evolving physical phenomena. In the crisis response domain,
for instance, one may be interested in representing the state of the unfolding
crisis (e.g., forest fire), the progress of the response activities such as
evacuation and traffic control, and the state of the crisis site(s). Such a
situation representation can then be used to support a multitude of
applications including situation monitoring, analysis, and planning. In this
paper, we make a case for an event based representation of situations where
events are defined to be domain-specific significant occurrences in space and
time. We argue that events offer a unifying and powerful abstraction to
building situational awareness applications. We identify challenges in building
an Event Management System (EMS) for which traditional data and knowledge
management systems prove to be limited and suggest possible directions and
technologies to address the challenges.

very low-mass binary. This binary can serve as a very useful dynamical
calibrator for pre-main sequence evolutionary models. However, its membership
in the TWA has been recently questioned despite due to the lack of accurate

  Based on proper motion, radial velocity, and trigonometric parallax

nearby associations.
  Using the ESO NTT/SUSI2 telescope, we observed TWA22AB during 5 different
observing runs over 1.2 years to measure its trigonometric parallax and proper

and proper motions of most known TWA members at a sub-milliarcsec level. HARPS
at the ESO 3.6m telescope was also used to measure the system's radial velocity
over 2 years.
  We report an absolute trigonometric parallax of TWA22AB, 57.0mas,
corresponding to a distance 17.5pc from Earth. Measured proper motions of
TWA22AB are -175.8mas/yr in right ascension and -21.3mas/yr in declination.

their accretion flows and the physical drivers that control the spectral
diversity of nearby active galactic nuclei. The characteristic values of the
bolometric luminosities and Eddington ratios, which span over 7-8 orders of
magnitude, from L_bol < 10^37 to 3 X 10^44 erg/s and L_bol/L_Edd ~ 10^-9 to

along the sequence absorption-line nuclei --> transition objects --> LINERs -->
Seyferts. The Eddington ratio also increases from early-type to late-type
galaxies. We show that the very modest accretion rates inferred from the
nuclear luminosities can be readily supplied through local mass loss from
evolved stars and Bondi accretion of hot gas, without appealing to additional
fueling mechanisms such as angular momentum transport on larger scales. Indeed,
we argue that the fuel reservoir generated by local processes should produce
far more active nuclei than is actually observed. This generic
luminosity-deficit problem suggests that the radiative efficiency in these
systems is much less than the canonical value of 0.1 for traditional optically
thick, geometrically thin accretion disks. The observed values of L_bol/L_Edd,
all substantially below unity, further support the hypothesis that massive BHs
in most nearby galaxies reside in a low or quiescent state, sustained by
accretion through a radiatively inefficient mode.

interesting cosmological constraints complementary to those of other methods.
In a flat universe with constant w including a Planck prior, LSST time delay
measurements for ~4,000 lenses should constrain the local Hubble constant h to
~0.007 (~1%), Omega_DE to ~0.005, and w to ~0.026 (all 1-sigma precisions).
Similar constraints could be obtained by a dedicated gravitational lens
observatory (OMEGA) which would obtain precise time delay and mass model
measurements for ~100 well-studied lenses. We compare these constraints (as
well as those for a general cosmology) to the ""optimistic Stage IV"" constraints
expected from weak lensing, supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and
cluster counts, as calculated by the Dark Energy Task Force. Time delays yield
a modest constraint on a time-varying w(z), with the best constraint on w(z) at
the ""pivot redshift"" of z ~ 0.31. Our Fisher matrix calculation is provided to
allow time delay constraints to be easily compared to and combined with
constraints from other experiments. We also show how cosmological constraining

functions for the galaxies' infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and
for the AGN contribution, allowing for evolution of these quantities. The
adopted SEDs take into account the contributions of both starbursts and AGN to
the infrared emission, for the first time in a coherent treatment rather than
invoking separate AGN and star-forming populations. In the first part of the
paper we consider the quantification of the AGN contribution for local universe
galaxies, as a function of total infrared luminosity. It is made using a large
sample of LIRGs and ULIRGs for which mid-infrared spectra are available in the
Spitzer archive. In the second part we present the model. Our best-fit model
adopts very strong luminosity evolution, $L=L_0(1+z)^{3.4}$, up to $z=2.3$, and
density evolution, $\rho=\rho_0(1+z)^2$, up to $z=1$, for the population of
infrared galaxies. At higher $z$, the evolution rates drop as $(1+z)^{-1}$ and
$(1+z)^{-1.5}$ respectively. To reproduce mid-infrared to submillimeter number
counts and redshift distributions, it is necessary to introduce both an
evolution in the AGN contribution and an evolution in the
luminosity-temperature relation. Our models are in plausible agreement with
current photometry-based estimates of the typical AGN contribution as a
function of mid-infrared flux, and well placed to be compared to upcoming
Spitzer spectroscopic results. As an example of future applications, we use our
best-fitting model to make predictions for surveys with Herschel.

galaxies by combining observational studies linking galaxy stellar and gas
budgets to their host dark matter (DM) properties, with a physically grounded
galaxy formation model. This enables us to analyse empirical relationships
between the virial, stellar, and gaseous masses of galaxies and explore their
physical origins. Utilising a semi-analytic model (SAM) to study the evolution
of baryonic material within evolving DM halos, we study the effects of baryonic
infall and various star formation and feedback mechanisms on the properties of
formed galaxies using the most up-to-date physical recipes. We find that in
order to significantly improve agreement with observations of low-mass galaxies
we must suppress the infall of baryonic material and exploit a two-phase
interstellar medium (ISM), where the ratio of HI to H_2 is determined by the
galactic disk structure. Modifying the standard Schmidt-Kennicutt star
formation law, which acts upon the total cold gas in galaxy discs and includes
a critical density threshold, and employing a star formation law which
correlates with the H_2 gas mass results in a lower overall star formation
rate. This in turn, allows us to simultaneously reproduce stellar, HI and H_2
mass functions of normal galaxies.

z ~ 3. The HeII optical depth derived from the Lyman-alpha forest decreases
substantially from this period to z ~ 2; moreover, it fluctuates strongly near
z ~ 3 and then evolves smoothly at lower redshifts. From these opacities, we
compute, using a semi-analytic model, the evolution of the mean photoionization
rate and the attenuation length for helium over the redshift range 2.0 < z <
3.2. This model includes an inhomogeneous metagalactic radiation background,
which is expected during and after helium reionization. We find that assuming a
uniform background underestimates the required photoionization rate by up to a
factor ~2. When averaged over the (few) available lines of sight, the effective
optical depth exhibits a discontinuity near z = 2.8, but the measurement
uncertainties are sizable. This feature translates into a jump in the
photoionization rate and, provided the quasar emissivity evolves smoothly, in
the effective attenuation length, perhaps signaling the helium reionization
era. We then compute the evolution of the effective optical depth for a variety
of simple helium reionization models, in which the measured quasar luminosity
function and the attenuation length, as well as the evolving HeIII fraction,
are inputs. A model with reionization ending around redshift z ~ 2.7 is most
consistent with the data, although the constraints are not strong thanks to the
sparseness of the data.

precise strong lensing modelling to probe external mass distributions
surrounding the lens. We consider SL2S J08544-0121, a galaxy group at z=0.35
that contains a strong lensing system. A simple elliptical isothermal potential
cannot reproduce satisfactorily the strong lensing constraints. We include an
external mass perturbation corresponding to the group within which the lens is
embedded. The lensing properties of this perturbation are parametrised by its
total mass M and a smoothing scale s that quantifies the characteristic scale
over which M is distributed. For a range of these parameters, we are able to
reproduce accurately the observations. This suggests that light is a good
tracer of mass. Interestingly, this also shows that a localised strong lensing
analysis (on scales of ~10"") allows us to constrain global properties of the
group as a whole (on scales of ~100). Indeed, we constrain the group
mass-to-light ratio to be M/L=98+-27 (i band, solar units, not corrected for
evolution) and s=20"" +- 9 (2sigma confidence level). We demonstrate that these
strong lensing only constraints are due to the perturbed strong lensing
configuration, where the main arc is located at ~5"" from the galaxy, whereas
its counter-image is found at ~8"". To test independently our resulting strong
lensing model, we pursue an independent weak lensing analysis of the group and
find a mass-to-light ratio in the range 66-146 (1sigma confidence level).

present a model capable of reproducing these results, which is used as a basis

differential source counts of submillimetre galaxies in all wavebands,
predicting that while ultra-luminous infrared galaxies dominate at the
brightest flux densities, the bulk of the infrared background is due to the
less luminous infrared galaxy population. The model also predicts confusion
limits and contributions to the cosmic infrared background that are consistent
with the BLAST results. Applying this to SPIRE gives predicted source confusion
limits of 19.4, 20.5 and 16.1mJy in the 250, 350 and 500 micron bands

times deeper than BLAST, revealing a fainter population of infrared-luminous
galaxies, and detecting approximately 2600, 1300, and 700 sources per square
degree in the SPIRE bands (with one in three sources expected to be a high

properties from quantum information perspective. In this paper we construct a
four-valent lattice, the so called ruby lattice, governed by a 2-body
Hamiltonian. In a particular regime of coupling constants, degenerate
perturbation theory implies that the low energy spectrum of the model can be
described by a many-body effective Hamiltonian, which encodes the color code as
its ground state subspace. The gauge symmetry
$\mathbf{Z}_{2}\times\mathbf{Z}_{2}$ of color code could already be realized by
identifying three distinct plaquette operators on the lattice. Plaquettes are
extended to closed strings or string-net structures. Non-contractible closed
strings winding the space commute with Hamiltonian but not always with each
other giving rise to exact topological degeneracy of the model. Connection to
2-colexes can be established at the non-perturbative level. The particular
structure of the 2-body Hamiltonian provides a fruitful interpretation in terms
of mapping to bosons coupled to effective spins. We show that high energy
excitations of the model have fermionic statistics. They form three families of
high energy excitations each of one color. Furthermore, we show that they
belong to a particular family of topological charges. Also, we use
Jordan-Wigner transformation in order to test the integrability of the model
via introducing of Majorana fermions. The four-valent structure of the lattice
prevents to reduce the fermionized Hamiltonian into a quadratic form due to
interacting gauge fields. We also propose another construction for 2-body
Hamiltonian based on the connection between color codes and cluster states. We
discuss this latter approach along the construction based on the ruby lattice.

light-curves that have been monitored over many years show long-term changes
due to variable dust obscuration, in addition to the stellar pulsation. The
distances to these objects are derived from the period-luminosity relation and
estimates of the mass-loss rates made from the Ko-[12] colour.
  We reclassify AS 245 as an S-type symbiotic, with a semi-regular cool
component with a pulsation period of about one year. The periods of the large
amplitude pulsations of SS73 38 (463 days), AS 210 (423 days) and H2-38 (395
days) are estimated for the first time, confirming that they are symbiotic
Miras.
  A comparison of the symbiotic Miras with normal Miras of similar pulsation
period shows that the symbiotic stars have on average higher values of Ko-[12].
This may indicate that they have higher mass-loss rates, or more likely that
the dust which is being lost by the Mira is trapped within the binary system.

is known to host a binary brown dwarf companion, Eps Ind Ba/Bb, at a large
projected separation of 6.7"", but radial velocity measurements imply that an
additional, yet unseen component is present in the system, much closer to Eps
Ind A. Previous direct imaging has excluded the presence of any stellar or
high-mass brown dwarf companion at small separations, indicating that the
unseen companion may be a low-mass brown dwarf or high-mass planet. We present
the results of a deep high-contrast imaging search for the companion, using
active angular differential imaging (aADI) at 4 micron, a particularly powerful
technique for planet searches around nearby and relatively old stars. We also
develop an additional PSF reference subtraction scheme based on locally
optimized combination of images (LOCI) to further enhance the detection limits.
No companion is seen in the images, although we are sensitive to significantly
lower masses than previously achieved. Combining the imaging data with the
known radial velocity trend, we constrain the properties of the companion to
within approximately 5-20 Mjup, 10-20 AU, and i > 20 deg, unless it is an
exotic stellar remnant. The results also imply that the system is probably
older than the frequently assumed age of ~1 Gyr.

ultracold fermionic atoms in a two-dimensional optical lattice with honeycomb
symmetry and we address here its experimental feasibility. We analyze in great
details the optical lattice generated by the coherent superposition of three
coplanar running laser waves with respective angles $2\pi/3$. The corresponding
band structure displays Dirac cones located at the corners of the Brillouin
zone and close to half-filling this system is well described by massless Dirac
fermions. We characterize their properties by accurately deriving the
nearest-neighbor hopping parameter $t_0$ as a function of the optical lattice
parameters. Our semi-classical instanton method proves in excellent agreement
with an exact numerical diagonalization of the full Hamilton operator in the
tight-binding regime. We conclude that the temperature range needed to access
the Dirac fermions regime is within experimental reach. We also analyze
imperfections in the laser configuration as they lead to optical lattice
distortions which affect the Dirac fermions. We show that the Dirac cones do
survive up to some critical intensity or angle mismatches which are easily
controlled in actual experiments. In the tight-binding regime, we predict, and
numerically confirm, that these critical mismatches are inversely proportional
to the square-root of the optical potential strength. We also briefly discuss
the interesting possibility of fine-tuning the mass of the Dirac fermions by
controlling the laser phase in an optical lattice generated by the incoherent
superposition of three coplanar independent standing waves with respective
angles $2\pi/3$.

with $L$ the system size, $d$ the lattice dimension and proportionality
constant $\alpha$. We also investigate the quantity $\epsilon_{L,k}$, the
finite-size inverse temperature where $k$ is the ratio of weights of the

$\epsilon_{L,k}$ versus $L$ converges to $\epsilon_\infty$ much faster than
$\alpha/L^d$, providing an economic alternative to locate the transition.
Moreover, we find that $\alpha \sim \ln k_{\rm opt} / {\cal L}_\infty$, with
${\cal L}_\infty$ the latent heat density. This suggests that liquid crystals

different fluid viscosities $\eta_{\rm in}$ and $\eta_{\rm out}$ inside and
outside, respectively, is studied using mesoscale simulation techniques.
Besides the well-known tank-treading and tumbling motions, an oscillatory
swinging motion is observed in the simulations for large shear rate. The
existence of this swinging motion requires the excitation of higher-order
undulation modes (beyond elliptical deformations) in two dimensions.
Keller-Skalak theory is extended to deformable two-dimensional vesicles, such
that a dynamical phase diagram can be predicted for the reduced shear rate and
the viscosity contrast $\eta_{\rm in}/\eta_{\rm out}$. The simulation results
are found to be in good agreement with the theoretical predictions, when
thermal fluctuations are incorporated in the theory. Moreover, the hydrodynamic
lift force, acting on vesicles under shear close to a wall, is determined from
simulations for various viscosity contrasts. For comparison, the lift force is
calculated numerically in the absence of thermal fluctuations using the
boundary-integral method for equal inside and outside viscosities. Both methods
show that the dependence of the lift force on the distance $y_{\rm {cm}}$ of
the vesicle center of mass from the wall is well described by an effective
power law $y_{\rm {cm}}^{-2}$ for intermediate distances $0.8 R_{\rm p}
\lesssim y_{\rm {cm}} \lesssim 3 R_{\rm p}$ with vesicle radius $R_{\rm p}$.
The boundary-integral calculation indicates that the lift force decays
asymptotically as $1/[y_{\rm {cm}}\ln(y_{\rm {cm}})]$ far from the wall.

  Introduction improved",,,,"math.GR math.KT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we improve recent results dealing with cellular covers of
$R$-modules. Cellular covers (sometimes called co-localizations) come up in the
context of homotopical localization of topological spaces. They are related to
idempotent cotriples, idempotent comonads or coreflectors in category theory.
  Recall that a homomorphism of $R$-modules $\pi: G\to H$ is called a {\it
cellular cover} over $H$ if $\pi$ induces an isomorphism $\pi_*:
\Hom_R(G,G)\cong \Hom_R(G,H),$ where $\pi_*(\phi)= \pi \phi$ for each $\phi \in
\Hom_R(G,G)$ (where maps are acting on the left). On the one hand, we show that
every cotorsion-free $R$-module of rank $\kappa<\Cont$ is realizable as the
kernel of some cellular cover $G\to H$ where the rank of $G$ is $3\kappa +1$
(or 3, if $\kappa=1$). The proof is based on Corner's classical idea of how to
construct torsion-free abelian groups with prescribed countable endomorphism
rings. This complements results by Buckner--Dugas \cite{BD}. On the other hand,
we prove that every cotorsion-free $R$-module $H$ that satisfies some rigid
conditions admits arbitrarily large cellular covers $G\to H$. This improves
results by Fuchs-G\""obel \cite{FG} and Farjoun-G\""obel-Segev-Shelah

convection for a Boussinesq fluid yields the formula:

  W_{r,laminar} where G(APE) and G(KE) are the work rate done by the buoyancy
and mechanical forcing respectively, \gamma_{mixing} is the mixing efficiency,
and W_{r,laminar} is the background rate of increase in gravitational potential
energy due to molecular diffusion. The formula shows that mechanical stirring
can easily induce a very strong buoyancy-driven overturning cell (meaning a
large G(APE)) even for a relatively low mixing efficiency, whereas this is only
possible in absence of mechanical stirring if \gamma_{mixing} >> 1. Moreover,
the buoyancy-driven overturning becomes mechanically controlled when
$\gamma_{mixing} G(KE) >> (1+\gamma_{mixing}) W_{r,laminar}$. This result
explains why the buoyancy-driven overturning cell in the laboratory experiments
by \cite{Whitehead2008} is amplified by the lateral motions of a stirring rod.
The formula implies that the thermodynamic efficiency of the ocean heat engine,
far from being negligibly small as is commonly claimed, might in fact be as
large as can be thanks to the stirring done by the wind and tides. These ideas
are further illustrated by means of idealised numerical experiments. A
non-Boussinesq extension of the above formula is also given.

application of a moderate magnetic field changes the average conductance and
the size of uctuations, but not the distribution when properly scaled. Although

fluids, both caused by molecular diffusion: 1) the dissipation rate D(APE) of
available potential energy (APE); 2) the turbulent rate of change Wr,turbulent
of background potential energy GPEr. So far, these two quantities have often
been regarded as the same energy conversion, namely the irreversible conversion
of APE into GPEr, owing to D(APE)=Wr,turbulent holding exactly for a Boussinesq
fluid with a linear equation of state. It was recently pointed out, however,
that this equality no longer holds for a thermally-stratified compressible
fluid, the ratio \xi=Wr,turbulent/D(APE) being then lower than unity and
sometimes even negative for water/seawater. In this paper, the behavior of the
ratio \xi is examined for different stratifications having the same buoyancy
frequency N(z), but different vertical profiles of the parameter \Upsilon =
\alpha P/(\rho C_p), where \alpha is the thermal expansion, P the hydrostatic
pressure, \rho the density, and C_p the isobaric specific heat capacity, the
equation of state considered being that for seawater for different particular
constant values of salinity. It is found that \xi and Wr,turbulent depend
critically on the sign and magnitude of d\Upsilon/dz, in contrast with D(APE),
which appears largely unaffected by the latter. These results have important
consequences for how the mixing efficiency should be defined and measured.

to provide fast and reliable GRB positions, to measure the broadband spectral
characteristics and temporal properties of the GRB prompt emission. This will
be obtained in first place thanks to a set of four space flown instruments. A
wide field (~2 sr) coded mask telescope (ECLAIRs), operating in the 4-250 keV
energy range, will provide the triggers and localizations, while a gamma-ray
non-imaging spectrometer (GRM), sensitive in the 50 keV-5 MeV domain, will
extend the prompt emission energy coverage. After a satellite slew, in order to
place the GRB direction within field of view of the two narrow field
instruments - a soft X-ray (XIAO), and a visible telescope (VT) - the GRB
position will be refined and the study of the early phases of the GRB afterglow
will be possible. A set of three ground based dedicated instruments, two
robotic telescopes (GFTs) and a wide angle optical monitor (GWAC), will
complement the space borne instruments. Thanks to the low energy trigger
threshold (~4 keV) of the ECLAIRs, SVOM is ideally suited for the detection of
soft, hence potentially most distant, GRBs. Its observing strategy is optimized
to facilitate follow-up observations from the largest ground based facilities.

Jordan-Wigner transformation. It is found that in the absence of magnetic
field, the thermodynamic behaviors are closely related to the gapped low-lying
excitations, and a novel structure with three peaks in the temperature
dependence of specific heat is unveiled. In a magnetic field, a phase diagram
in the temperature-field plane for the couplings satisfying JAF1=JAF2=JF is
obtained, in which various phases are identified. The temperature dependence of
thermodynamic quantities including the magnetization, susceptibility and
specific heat are studied to characterize the corresponding phases. It is
disclosed that the magnetization has a crossover behavior at low temperature in
the Luttinger liquid phase, which is shown falling into the same class as that
in the S=1 Haldane chain. In the plateau regime, the thermodynamic behaviors
alter at a certain field, which results from the crossing of two excitation
spectra. By means of the fermion mapping, it is uncovered that the system has
four spectra from fermion and hole excitations that are responsible for the
observed thermodynamic behaviors.

least-squares deconvolution and demonstrate that they both give very similar
results as a consequence of the special statistical properties of the weights.
The Zeeman signatures are unequivocally detected in this multiline approach. We
may anticipate the outcome that magnetic field detection is reliable well
beyond the weak-field approximation. Linear polarisation in the spectra of
solar type stars can be detected when the spectral resolution is sufficiently
high.

The nanowires in an applied magnetic field show negative magetoresistance that
saturates for H <= HC. The noise spectral power shows a reduction in low

various database problems such as the constraint implication problem,
Conjunctive Query optimization, rewriting queries using views, data exchange,
and data integration. The basic idea of the chase is, given a database instance
and a set of constraints as input, to fix constraint violations in the database
instance. It is well-known that, for an arbitrary set of constraints, the chase
does not necessarily terminate (in general, it is even undecidable if it does
or not). Addressing this issue, we review the limitations of existing
sufficient termination conditions for the chase and develop new techniques that
allow us to establish weaker sufficient conditions. In particular, we introduce
two novel termination conditions called safety and inductive restriction, and
use them to define the so-called T-hierarchy of termination conditions. We then
study the interrelations of our termination conditions with previous conditions
and the complexity of checking our conditions. This analysis leads to an
algorithm that checks membership in a level of the T-hierarchy and accounts for
the complexity of termination conditions. As another contribution, we study the
problem of data-dependent chase termination and present sufficient termination
conditions w.r.t. fixed instances. They might guarantee termination although
the chase does not terminate in the general case. As an application of our
techniques beyond those already mentioned, we transfer our results into the
field of query answering over knowledge bases where the chase on the underlying
database may not terminate, making existing algorithms applicable to broader
classes of constraints.

inclination is predominantly horizontal. We critically reconsider the analysis
of such observations and carry out a complete Bayesian analysis with the aim of
extracting as much information as possible from them, including error bars. We
apply the recently developed BayesME code that carries out a complete Bayesian
inference for Milne-Eddington atmospheres. The sampling of the posterior
distribution function is obtained with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo scheme and
the marginal distributions are analyzed in detail. The Kullback-Leibler
divergence is used to study the extent to which the observations introduce new
information in the inference process resulting in sufficiently constrained
parameters. Our analysis clearly shows that only upper limits to the magnetic
field strength can be inferred with fields in the kG regime completely
discarded. Furthermore, the noise level present in the analyzed Hinode
observations induces a substantial loss of information for constraining the
azimuth of the magnetic field. Concerning the inclination of the field, we
demonstrate that some information is available to constrain it for those pixels
with the largest polarimetric signal. The results also point out that the field
in pixels with small polarimetric signals can be nicely reproduced in terms of
a quasi-isotropic distribution.

an important family of compounds because of their large presence in the earth's

practical applications remain limited and the emergence of ferroelectricity and
related functional properties in simple binary oxides seems so unlikely that it
was never previously considered. Here, we show using first-principles density
functional calculations that ferroelectricity can be easily induced in simple

epitaxial strains. Going beyond the fundamental discovery, we show that the
functional properties (polarization, dielectric constant and piezoelectric

of typical ferroelectric perovskite oxides, so making them of direct interest

oxides, suggesting a route to new multiferroics combining ferroelectric and

a way to deal with gauge copies in the Landau gauge. We explicitly show that

The mixing matrix allows us to uncover a renormalization group invariant

invariant, we have paved the way for the study of the lightest scalar glueball

asymmetry of the W boson mass (MW+ - MW-) at the LHC within the ATLAS
experiment. This measurement is of primordial importance for the LHC
experimental program, both as a direct test of the charge sign independent
coupling of the W bosons to the fermions and as a mandatory preliminary step
towards the precision measurement of the charge averaged W boson mass. This
last pragmatic point can be understood since the LHC specific collisions will
provide unprecedented kinematics for the positive and negative channels while
the SPS and Tevatron collider produced W+ and W- on the same footing. For that
reason, the study of the asymmetries between W+ and W- in Drell--Yan like
processes (production of single W decaying into leptons), studied to extract
the properties of the W boson, is described thoroughly in this document. Then,
the prospect for a measurement of MW+ - MW- at the LHC is addressed in a
perspective intending to decrease as much as possible the systematic errors
that will inevitably comes from the misunderstanding of both phenomenological
and apparatus modeling. For that matter strategies have been devised
specifically for the present measurement to display robustness with respect to
the main uncertainties. These strategies consist of introducing new observables
along with considering specific LHC running modes and configurations of the
ATLAS tracker. Eventually we show that the present (2009) precision can be
improved at the LHC by a factor of 20 and argue that such a precision is beyond
the reach of the standard measurement and calibration methods imported to the
LHC from the Tevatron program.

wavelengths. We also develop new tools for the analysis of background
fluctuations to constrain source counts in regimes of high confusion. We
analyse a large variety of new data on galaxy evolution and high-z source
populations from Spitzer surveys, as well as complementary data from sub-mm
(BLAST) and millimetric ground-based observations. These data confirm earlier
indications about a very rapid increase of galaxy volume emissivity up to z~1.
This is the fastest evolution rate observed for galaxies at any wavelengths.
The observed Spitzer counts at 24 micron require a combination of fast
evolution for the dominant population and a bumpy spectrum with substantial PAH
emission at z~1 to 2. Confusion-limited number counts at longer wavelengths
confirm these results. All the present data require that the fast observed
evolution from z=0 to 1 flattens around redshift 1 and then keeps approximately
constant up to z~2.5 at least. The present-day IR data provide clear evidence
for the existence of a distinct population of very luminous galaxies becoming
dominant at z > 1. Their cosmological evolution, peaking around z~2, shows a
faster decay with cosmic time than lower luminosity systems, whose maximal
activity is set around z~1, then supporting an earlier phase of formation for
the most luminous and massive galaxies. From a comparison of our results on the
comoving IR emissivity with recent estimates of the redshift-dependent stellar
mass functions of galaxies, we infer that a large fraction (>=50%) of the IR
activity at z > 1 should be due to obscured AGN accretion and that concomitant
SF in high-z luminous sources should follow a top-heavy IMF.

bending-torsion model, the fiber self-assembly is described by the 2D Landau-de
Gennes quadrupolar Q-tensor order parameter model, and the fiber-membrane
interactions (inspired by an extension of the 2D Maier-Saupe model to curved
surfaces) include competing curvo-philic (curvature-seeking) and curvo-phobic
(curvature-avoiding) effects. Analysis of the free energy reveals three fiber
orientation regimes: (a) along the major curvature, (b) along the minor
curvature, (c) away from the principal curvatures, according to the competing
curvo-philic and curvo-phobic interactions. The derived shape equation (normal
stress balance) now includes curvature-nematic ordering contributions, with
both bending and torsion renormalizations. Integration of the shape and nematic
order equations gives a complete model whose solution describes the coupled
membrane shape/fiber order state. Applications to cylindrical membranes,
relevant to the plant cell wall, shows how growth decreases the fiber order
parameter and moves the fiber's director from the axial direction towards the
azimuthal orientation, eventually leading to a state of stress predicted by
pure membranes. The ubiquitous 54.7o cellulose fibril orientation in a
cylindrical plant cell wall is shown to be predicted by the preset model when
the ratio of curvo-phobic and curvo-philic interactions is in the range of the

deduced: |Q(31Al)| = 134.0(16) mb. Comparison of this value with large-scale
shell-model calculations in the sd and sdpf valence spaces suggests that the
31Al ground state is dominated by normal sd-shell configurations with a
possible small contribution of intruder states. The obtained value for
|Q(31Al)| and a compilation of measured quadrupole moments of odd-Z even-N
isotopes in comparison with shell-model calculations shows that the proton
effective charge e_p=1.1 e provides a much better description of the nuclear
properties in the sd-shell than the adopted value e_p=1.3 e.

dependent finite width of quark gluon plasma (QGP) bags on their equation of
state. It is shown that the large width of the QGP bags not only explains the
observed deficit in the number of hadronic resonances, but also clarifies the
reason why the heavy QGP bags cannot be directly observed as metastable states
in a hadronic phase. I show how the model allows one to estimate the minimal
value of the width of QGP bags being heavier than 2.5 GeV from a variety of the
lattice QCD data and to get the minimal resonance width at zero temperature of
about 600 MeV. The Regge trajectories of large and heavy QGP bags are
established both in a vacuum and in a strongly interacting medium. It is shown
that at high temperatures the average mass and width of the QGP bags behave in
accordance with the upper bound of the Regge trajectory asymptotics (the linear
asymptotics), whereas at low temperatures (below a half of the Hagedorn
temperature T_H [1] they obey the lower bound of the Regge trajectory
asymptotics (the square root one). Thus, for temperatures below T_H/2 the spin
of the QGP bags is restricted from above, whereas for temperatures above T_H/2
these bags demonstrate the typical Regge behavior consistent with the string
models.

approximation of the full quantum mechanical description of intracellular
dynamics. We discuss what principal elements any such good approximation should
contain. As one such element, the notion of ""Catalytic force"" Cf is introduced.
Cf is the effect of the molecular target of catalysis on the catalytic
microenvironment that adjusts the microenvironment towards a state that
facilitates the catalytic act. This phenomenon is experimentally testable and
has an intriguing implication for biological organization and evolution, as it
amounts to ""optimization without natural selection of replicators"". Unlike the
statistical-mechanical approaches to self-organization, the Cf principle does
not encounter the problem of ""tradeoff between stability and complexity"" at the
level of individual cell. Physically, the Cf is considered as a harmonic-like
force of reaction, which keeps the state of the cell close to the ground state,
defined here as a state where enzymatic acts work most efficiently. Ground
state is subject to unitary evolution, and serves as a starting point in a
general strategy of quantum description of intracellular processes, termed here
""Euclidean approach"". The next step of this strategy is transition from the
description of ground state to that one of growing state, and we suggest how it
can be accomplished using arguments from the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.
Finally, given that the most reliable and informative observable of an
individual cell is the sequence of its genome, we propose that the
non-classical correlations between individual molecular events at the single
cell level could be easiest to detect using high throughput DNA sequencing.

logarithmic correction to the quantum wave equation. We demonstrate the
emergence of the evolution time from the group of automorphisms of the von

time parametrization is essentially energy-dependent and becomes global only
asymptotically - when the energies get very small comparing to the effective
quantum gravity scale. Similar thing happens to the Lorentz invariance - in the
resulting theory it becomes an asymptotic low-energy phenomenon. We show how
the logarithmic non-linearity deforms the vacuum wave dispersion relations and
explains certain features of the astrophysical data coming from recent
observations of high-energy cosmic rays. In general, the estimates imply that
ceteris paribus the particles with higher energy propagate slower than those
with lower one, therefore, for a high-energy particle the mean free path,
lifetime in a high-energy state and, therefore, travel distance from the source
can be significantly larger than one would expect from the conventional theory.
Apart from this, we discuss also the possibility and conditions of the
transluminal phenomena in the physical vacuum such as the Cherenkov-type shock
waves.

the data in publicly- available GALEX and UDF catalogs, we created 6 samples of
galaxies with observations in a rest-frame band centered at 141 nm and 5 with
data from one centered on 225 nm. These bands correspond, respectively, to the
FUV and NUV bands of GALEX for objects at z = 0.1. By maintaining the same
rest-frame wave-band of all observations we greatly minimized the effects of
k-correction and filter transformation. Since SB depends on the absolute
magnitude, all galaxy samples were then matched for the absolute magnitude
range (-17.7 < M(AB) < -19.0) and for mean absolute magnitude. We performed
homogeneous measurements of the magnitude and half-light radius for all the
galaxies in the 11 samples, obtaining the median UV surface brightness for each
sample. We compared the data with two models: 1) The LCDM expanding universe
model with the widely-accepted evolution of galaxy size R prop H(z)-1 and 2) a
simple, Euclidean, non-expanding (ENE) model with the distance given by
d=cz/H0. We found that the ENE model was a significantly better fit to the data
than the LCDM model with galaxy size evolution. While the LCDM model provides a
good fit to the HUDF data alone, there is a 1.2 magnitude difference in the SB
predicted from the model for the GALEX data and observations, a difference at
least 5 times larger than any statistical error. The ENE provides a good fit to

the real WKB theory that we previously developed for the Markovian evolution of
extended states, but it also describes the decoherent and dissipative evolution
of localized states, such as the interference terms of a Schr\""odinger cat

A gate potential applied to the conduction electrons is known to change
markedly the transport properties of a quantum dot side-coupled to the

is shown to affect only quantitatively the temperature dependence of the
