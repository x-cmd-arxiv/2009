the ionization history can be constrained by measurements of the CMB
temperature and polarization angular power spectra. We show that models which
fit recently measured excesses in 10-1000 GeV electron and positron cosmic rays

Planck satellite will be capable of ruling out a wide range of DM explanations
for these excesses. In models of dark matter with Sommerfeld-enhanced
annihilation, where sigma v rises with decreasing WIMP velocity until some
saturation point, the WMAP5 constraints imply that the enhancement must be
close to saturation in the neighborhood of the Earth.

from turbulence affected by large-scale shear and rotation. Three-dimensional
numerical simulations are used to study turbulent transport under the
influences of large-scale shear and rotation in homogeneous, isotropically
forced turbulence. We study three cases: one with only shear, and two others
where in addition to shear, rotation is present. These cases differ by the
angle (0 or 90\degr) the rotation vector makes with respect to the z-direction.
Two subsets of runs are performed with both values of \theta where either
rotation or shear is kept constant. When only shear is present, the
off-diagonal stress can be described by turbulent viscosity whereas if the
system also rotates, nondiffusive contributions (\Lambda-effect) to the stress
can arise. Comparison of the direct simulations are made with analytical
results from a simple closure model. We find that the turbulent viscosity is of
the order of the first order smoothing result in the parameter regime studied
and that for sufficiently large Reynolds numbers the Strouhal number,
describing the ratio of correlation to turnover times, is roughly 1.5. This is
consistent with the closure model based on the minimal tau-approximation which
produces a reasonable fit to the simulation data for similar Strouhal numbers.
In the cases where rotation is present, separating the diffusive and
nondiffusive components of the stress turns out to be challenging but taking
the results at face value, we can obtain nondiffusive contributions of the
order of 0.1 times the turbulent viscosity. We also find that the simple
closure model is able to reproduce most of the qualitative features of the
numerical results provided that the Strouhal number is of the order of unity.

medium by stellar winds--are continually influenced by their passage through
the fluctuating interstellar medium (ISM). Inside dense interstellar regions,
an astrosphere may be compressed to a size smaller than the liquid-water
habitable zone distance. Habitable planets then enjoy no astrospheric buffering
from the full flux of Galactic cosmic rays and interstellar dust and gas, a
situation we call ``descreening.'' Recent papers (Yeghikyan and Fahr, Pavlov et
al.) have suggested such global consequences as severe ozone depletion and
glaciation. Using a ram-pressure balance model that includes gravitational
focusing of the interstellar flow, we compute the size of the astrosphere in
the apex direction as a function of parent star mass. We derive a dependence on
the parent-star mass M due to gravitational focusing for densities larger than
about 100 (M/M_\odot)^{-2} cm^{-3}. We calculate the interstellar densities
required to descreen planets in the habitable zone of solar- and subsolar-mass
stars and find a critical descreening density of roughly 600 (M/M_\odot)^{-2}
cm^{-3} for the Sun's velocity relative to the local ISM. Finally, we estimate
from ISM observations the frequency of descreening encounters as 1--10 Gyr^{-1}
for solar-type stars and 10^2--10^9 times smaller for M stars. Given this
disparity, we conclude that M star habitable-zone planets are virtually never
exposed to the severe effects discussed by Yeghikyan and Fahr and Pavlov et al.

the vicinity of the qubit. In addition to yielding stronger coupling with
respect to other proposals for flux qubit based circuit QED, this approach
leads to a qubit-resonator coupling strength g which does not scale as the area
of the qubit but is proportional to the total inductance shared between the
resonator and the qubit. Strong coupling can thus be attained while still
minimizing sensitivity to flux noise. Finally, we show that by taking advantage
of the the large kinetic inductance of a Josephson junction in the center
conductor of the resonator can lead to coupling energies of several tens of
percent of the resonator frequency, reaching the ultrastrong coupling regime of
cavity QED where the rotating-wave approximation breaks down. This should allow
an on-chip implementation of the E x B Jahn-Teller model.

9.98^{+1.10}_{-1.99} LU (line unit; photons cm^-2 s^-1 Sr^-1) and
2.66^{+0.37}_{-0.30} LU, respectively. Meanwhile, FUSE OVI observations for the
same directions and SPEAR CIV observations for a nearby direction indicate the
existence of hot halo gas at temperatures of ~10^{5.0} K to ~10^{6.0} K. This
collection of data implies that the hot gas in the Galactic halo is not
isothermal, but its temperature spans a relatively wide range from ~10^{5.0} K
to ~10^{7.0} K. We therefore construct a differential emission measure (DEM)
model for the halo's hot gas, consisting of two components. In each, dEM/dlog T
is assumed to follow a power-law function of the temperature and the gas is
assumed to be in collisional ionizational equilibrium. The low-temperature
component (LTC) of the broken power-law DEM model covers the temperature range
of 10^{4.80}-10^{6.02} K with a slope of 0.30 and the high-temperature
component (HTC) covers the temperature range of 10^{6.02}-10^{7.02} K with a
slope of -2.21. We find that a simple model in which hot gas accretes onto the
Galactic halo and cools radiatively cannot explain both the observed UV and
X-ray portions of our broken power-law model. It can, however, explain the
intensity in the Suzaku bandpass if the mass infall rate is 1.35*10^{-3} Msun
yr^-1 kpc^-2. The UV and X-ray intensities and our broken power-law model can
be well explained by hot gas produced by supernova explosions or by supernova

Model (SM) fermion masses can be misaligned in flavor space with the Yukawa
couplings to the Higgs boson, even with only one Higgs doublet. Such
misalignment results in flavor-violating couplings to the Higgs and hence
flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) processes from tree-level Higgs
exchange. We perform a model-independent analysis of such an effect.
Specializing to the framework of a composite Higgs with partially composite SM
gauge and fermion fields, we show that the constraints on the compositeness
scale implied by epsilon_K can be generically as strong as those from the
exchange of heavy spin-1 resonances if the Higgs is light and strongly coupled
to the new states. In the special and well motivated case of a composite
pseudo-Goldstone Higgs, we find that the shift symmetry acting on the Higgs
forces an alignment of the fermion mass terms with their Yukawa couplings at
leading order in the fermions' degree of compositeness, thus implying much
milder bounds. As a consequence of the flavor-violating Higgs couplings, we
estimate BR(t -> c h) ~ 10^{-4} and BR(h -> tc) ~ 5 x 10^{-3} both for a
pseudo-Goldstone (if t_R is fully composite) and for a generic composite Higgs.
By virtue of the AdS/CFT correspondence, our results directly apply to

the velocity attenuation is more significant in dust compared to the radiation
era. We also find that in an expanding background the Alfven wave propaga- tion

However, a significant challenge in continuum-mechanics-based modeling of DNA
is to estimate its constitutive law, which follows from its interatomic
bond-stiffness. Experiments and all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
have suggested that the constitutive law is nonlinear and non-homogeneous
(sequence-dependent) along the length of DNA. In this paper, we present an
estimation method and a validation study using discrete-structure simulations.
We consider a simple cantilever-rod with an artificially constructed, discrete
lattice-structure which gives rise to a constitutive law. Large deformations
are then simulated. An effective constitutive-law is estimated from these
deformations using inverse methods. Finally, we test the estimated law by
employing it in the continuum rod-model and comparing the simulation results
with those of discrete-structure simulations under a different cantilever
loading-conditions.

phases: at each phase we pick a collection of disjoint subsets covering i new
elements, starting from i = k down to i = p+1. At a final step we cover the
remaining base elements by the subsets of size p. We derive the exact
performance guarantee of this algorithm for all values of k and p, which is
less than Hk, where Hk is the k'th harmonic number. However, the algorithm
exhibits the known improvement methods over the greedy one for the unweighted
k-set cover problem (in which subset sizes are only restricted not to exceed
k), and hence it serves as a benchmark for our improved algorithm. The improved
algorithm for the special case of (p,k) = (2,4) is based on non-oblivious local

sets of size 3 and 4 so as to maximize an objective function which prefers big

derivatives of curvatures. The formulas for derivatives of curvature resemble
the formulas for the change of scalar curvature under a conformal variation of
Riemannian metric. They allow us to explicitly describe the variation of
certain curvature functionals, including Regge's formulation of the
Einstein-Hilbert functional (total scalar curvature), and to consider convexity
of these functionals. They also allow us to prove rigidity theorems for certain
analogues of constant curvature and Einstein manifolds in the piecewise flat
setting.

were an important, and quite possibly dominant, source of the ultra-violet
radiation that reionized the hydrogen gas in the intergalactic medium (IGM); a
state in which it has remained to the present day. Measurements of cosmic
microwave background anisotropies suggest that this phase-change largely took
place in the redshift range z=10.8 +/- 1.4, while observations of quasars and
Lyman-alpha galaxies have shown that the process was essentially completed by
z=6. However, the detailed history of reionization, and characteristics of the
stars and proto-galaxies that drove it, remain unknown. Further progress in
understanding requires direct observations of the sources of ultra-violet
radiation in the era of reionization, and mapping the evolution of the neutral
hydrogen fraction through time. The detection of galaxies at such redshifts is
highly challenging, due to their intrinsic faintness and high luminosity
distance, whilst bright quasars appear to be rare beyond z~7. Here we report
the discovery of a gamma-ray burst, GRB 090423, at redshift z=8.26 -0.08 +0.07.
This is well beyond the redshift of the most distant spectroscopically

stars were being produced, and dying as GRBs, ~625 million years after the Big
Bang. In addition, the accurate position of the burst pinpoints the location of
the most distant galaxy known to date. Larger samples of GRBs beyond z~7 will
constrain the evolving rate of star formation in the early universe, while
rapid spectroscopy of their afterglows will allow direct exploration of the
progress of reionization with cosmic time.

pertaining to its very definition or spin-relaxation processes. More
specifically, we show how an unpolarized incident charge-current can induce a
pure transverse spin-current by means of scattering at a normal metal/2DEG
interface. This occurs for both Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling. An
experimental setup for observation of this effect is proposed.

high precision photometric redshift. With accurate photometric redshifts, it
becomes possible to measure the cosmic magnification on galaxies by galaxies

not use galaxy shapes, instead it will strongly rely on precise photometry and
detailed color information. In this work it is shown that such a measurement

remarkable complementarity with cosmic shear. Future cosmic shear surveys could
gain tremendously from magnification measurements as an independent probe of

phenomenon; here we investigate the potential role of planet accretion in
spinning up these stars. Using Zahn's theory of tidal friction and stellar
evolution models, we compute the decay of a planet's orbit into its evolving
host star and the resulting transfer of angular momentum into the stellar
convective envelope. This experiment assesses the frequency of planet ingestion
and rapid rotation on the red giant branch (RGB) for a sample of 99 known
exoplanet host stars. We find that the known exoplanets are indeed capable of
creating rapid rotators; however, the expected fraction due to planet ingestion
is only ~10% of the total seen in surveys of present-day red giants. Of the
planets ingested, we find that those with smaller initial semimajor axes are
more likely to create rapid rotators because these planets are accreted when
the stellar moment of inertia is smallest. We also find that many planets may
be ingested prior to the RGB phase, contrary to the expectation that accretion
would generally occur when the stellar radii expand significantly as giants.
Finally, our models suggest that the rapid rotation signal from ingested
planets is most likely to be seen on the lower RGB, which is also where
alternative mechanisms for spin-up, e.g., angular momentum dredged up from the
stellar core, do not operate. Thus, rapid rotators on the lower RGB are the
best candidates to search for definitive evidence of systems that have
experienced planet accretion.

spread, the multiple populations are separated by a few hundred Myr, which
would call into question the long held notion that clusters are simple stellar
populations. Here we show that stellar rotation in stars with masses between
1.2-1.7 Msun can mimic the effect of a double or multiple population, whereas
in actuality only a single population exists. The two main causes of the spread
near the turn-off are the effects of stellar rotation on the structure of the
star and the inclination angle of the star relative to the observer. Both
effects change the observed effective temperature, hence colour, and flux of
the star. In order to match observations, the required rotation rates are
20-50% of the critical rotation, which are consistent with observed rotation
rates of similar mass stars in the Galaxy. We provide scaling relations which
can be applied to non-rotating isochrones in order to mimic the effects of
rotation. Finally, we note that rotation is unlikely to be the cause of the
multiple stellar populations observed in old globular clusters, as low mass

important for understanding the outburst behavior. Large convective eddies
develop during the high state in the inner disk. The models are in agreement

onto the star is terminated. We study the evolution of accreting protostars and
the limits of accretion in low metallicity environments. Accretion rates onto
protostars are estimated via the temperature evolution of prestellar cores with
different metallicities. The derived rates increase with decreasing
metallicity, from 10^-6 M_sun/yr at Z = Z_sun to 10^-3 M_sun/yr at Z = 0. With
the derived accretion rates, the protostellar evolution is numerically
calculated. We find that, at lower metallicity, the protostar has a larger
radius and reaches the zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) at higher stellar mass.
Using this protostellar evolution, we evaluate the upper stellar mass limit
where the mass accretion is hindered by radiative feedback. We consider the
effects of radiation pressure exerted on the accreting envelope, and expansion
of the HII region. The mass accretion is finally terminated by radiation
pressure on dust grains in the envelope for Z > 10^-3 Z_sun and by the
expanding HII region for lower metallicty. The mass limit from these effects
increases with decreasing metallicity from 10 M_sun at Z = Z_sun to about 300
M_sun at Z = 10^-6 Z_sun. The termination of accretion occurs after the central
star arrives at the ZAMS at all metallicities, which allows us to neglect
protostellar evolution effects in discussing the upper mass limit by stellar
feedback. The fragmentation induced by line cooling in low-metallicity clouds
yields prestellar cores with masses large enough that the final stellar mass is
set by the feedback effects.

described by J. C. Maxwell in 1873, has been and continues to be a useful
method for solving many three dimensional electrostatic problems. Here we
demonstrate that as expected when the series is truncated to any finite order
N, the electric field resulting from the truncated series becomes qualitatively
more similar to the correct field as N increases. A method of charge
normalization is developed which provides significant improvement for truncated
low order solutions. The formulation of the normalization technique and its
solution via a matrix inversion has similarities to the method of moments,
which is a numerical solution of Poisson's equation, using an integral equation
for the unknown charge density with a known boundary potential. The last
section of this paper presents a gradient search method to optimize a set of L
point charges for M spheres. This method may use the image charge series to
initialize the gradient search. We demonstrate quantitatively how the metric
can be optimized by adjusting the locations and amounts of charge for the set
of points, and that an optimized set of charges generally performs better than
truncated normalized image charges, at the expense of gradient search iteration
time.

power loss parameter, $\alpha$, which governs how much transmit power the

accurate approximation to $\alpha$ in Rayleigh and Rician fading environments

cognitive radio capacity. In all cases, the use of the approximation is shown

cooling due to neutrino emission from any direct Urca process, due either to
nucleons or to exotica such as hyperons, Bose condensates, or deconfined
quarks, does not occur. This scenario was developed to replace and extend the
so-called standard cooling scenario to include neutrino emission from the
Cooper pair breaking and formation processes that occur near the critical
temperature for superfluid/superconductor pairing.
  Recently, it has been found that Cooper-pair neutrino emission from the
vector channel is suppressed by a large factor compared to the original
estimates that violated vector current conservation. We show that Cooper-pair
neutrino emission remains, nevertheless, an efficient cooling mechanism through
the axial channel. As a result, the elimination of neutrino emission from
Cooper-paired nucleons through the vector channel has only minor effects on the
long-term cooling of neutron stars within the minimal cooling paradigm. We
further quantify precisely the effect of the size of the neutron 3P2 gap and
demonstrate that consistency between observations and the minimal cooling
paradigm requires that the critical temperature T_c for this gap covers a range
of values between T_c^min < 0.2 x 10^9 K up to T_c^max > 0.5 \times 10^9 K in
the core of the star. In addition, it is required that young neutron stars have
heterogenous envelope compositions: some must have light-element compositions
and others must have heavy-element compositions. Unless these two conditions
are fulfilled, about half of the observed young cooling neutron stars are
inconsistent with the minimal cooling paradigm and provide evidence for the
existence of enhanced cooling.

central engine model of a Kerr black hole (BH) surrounded by a magnetized

and disk through a large-scale closed magnetic field exerts a torque on the
disk, and transports the rotational energy from the BH to the disk. We
investigate the properties of the NDAF with this magnetic torque. For a rapid
spinning BH, the magnetic torque transfers enormous rotational energy from BH
into the inner disk. There are two consequences: (i) the luminosity of neutrino
annihilation is greatly augmented; (ii) the disk becomes thermally and
viscously unstable in the inner region, and behaves S-Shape of the surface
density versus accretion rate. It turns out that magnetically torqued NDAF can
be invoked to interpret the variability of gamma-ray luminosity. In addition,
we discuss the possibility of restarting the central engine to produce the
X-ray flares with required energy.

linear systems with Gaussian noise and intermittent observations, available
according to a Bernoulli arrival process. They showed that there is a
""critical"" arrival probability of the observations, such that under that
threshold the expected value of the covariance matrix (i.e., the quadratic
error) of the estimate is unbounded. Sinopoli et al., and successive authors,
interpreted this result implying that the behavior of the system is
qualitatively different above and below the threshold. This paper shows that
this is not necessarily the only interpretation. In fact, the critical
probability is different if one considers the average error instead of the
average quadratic error. More generally, finding a meaningful ""average""
covariance is not as simple as taking the algebraic expected value. A rigorous
way to frame the problem is in a differential geometric framework, by
recognizing that the set of covariance matrices (or better, the manifold of
Gaussian distributions) is not a flat space, and then studying the intrinsic
Riemannian mean. Several metrics on this manifold are considered that lead to
different critical probabilities, or no critical probability at all.

would be very interesting. Also one may be able to rule out some dark energy

combining a result with Liu and Xi, we see that two representation-finite
algebras $A$ and $B$ over a perfect field are stably equivalent of Morita type
if and only if their Auslander algebras are stably equivalent of Morita type.
Moreover, since stable equivalence of Morita type preserves $n$-cluster tilting
modules, we extend this result to $n$-representation-finite algebras and
$n$-Auslander algebras studied by Iyama.

quantum gravity and non standard particle physics. They can be considered as
the ultimate particle accelerator in their last (explosive) moments since they
are supposed to reach, very briefly, the Planck temperature. Upper limits on
the primordial black hole number density of mass $M_{\star} = 5 10^{14}$ g, the
Hawking mass (born in the big-bang terminating their life presently), is
determined comparing their predicted cumulative $\gamma$-ray emission,
galaxy-wise, to the one observed by the EGRET satellite, once corrected for non
thermal $\gamma$-ray background emission induced by cosmic ray protons and
electrons interacting with light and matter in the Milky Way. A model with free
gas emissivities is used to map the Galaxy in the 100 MeV photon range, where
the peak of the primordial black hole emission is expected. The best gas
emissivities and additional model parameters are obtained by fitting the EGRET
data and are used to derive the maximum emission of the primordial black hole
of the Hawking mass, assuming that they are distributed like the dark matter in
the Galactic halo. The bounds we obtain, depending on the dark matter
distribution, extrapolated to the whole Universe ($\Omega_{PBH}(M_{\star}) =
2.4 10^{-10}$ to $2.6 10^{-9}$ are more stringent than the previous ones
derived from extragalactic $\gamma$-ray background and antiprotons fluxes,
though less model dependent and based on more robust data. These new limits
have interesting consequences on the theory of the formation of small
structures in the Universe, since they are the only constraint on very small
scale density fluctuations left by inflation.

at high luminosity it is possible to measure the couplings of a charged Higgs

argue that by combining the possible measurements of the LHC and the

web. In this study, we present and compare two distinct algorithms for finding
cosmic filaments and sheets, a task which is far less well established than the
identification of dark matter halos or voids. One method is based on the
smoothed dark matter density field, the other uses the halo distributions
directly. We apply both techniques to one high resolution N-body simulation and
reconstruct the filamentary/sheet like network of the dark matter density
field. We focus on investigating the properties of the dark matter halos inside
these structures, in particular on the directions of their spins and the
orientation of their shapes with respect to the directions of the filaments and
sheets. We find that both the spin and the major axes of filament-halos with
masses <= 10^{13} M_sun/h are preferentially aligned with the direction of the
filaments. The spins and major axes of halos in sheets tend to lie parallel to
the sheets. There is an opposite mass dependence of the alignment strengths for
the spin (negative) and major (positive) axes, i.e. with increasing halo mass
the major axis tends to be more strongly aligned with the direction of the
filament whereas the alignment between halo spin and filament becomes weaker
with increasing halo mass. The alignment strengths as a function of distance to
the most massive node halo indicate that there is a transit large scale
environment impact: from the 2-D collapse phase of the filament to the 3-D
collapse phase of the cluster/node halo at small separation. Overall, the two
algorithms for filament/sheet identification investigated here agree well with
each other. The method based on halos alone can be easily adapted for use with

radiative transfer. The model galaxy is employed from an ultra-high-resolution
chemodynamic simulation of a primordial galaxy by Mori & Umemura (2006),which
well reproduces the observed properties of LAEs and LBGs. The total mass of
model galaxy is 10^{11}M_sun. We solve not only photo-ionization but also
collisional ionization by shocks. In addition, according to the chemical
enrichment, we incorporate the effect of dust extinction, taking the size
distributions of dust into account. As a result, we find that dust extinction
reduces the escape fractions by a factor 1.5-8.5 in the LAE phase and by a
factor 2.5-11 in the LBG phase, while the collisional ionization by shocks
increases the escape fractions by a factor ~ 2. The resultant escape fractions
are 0.07-0.47 in the LAE phase and 0.06-0.17 in the LBG phase. These results
are well concordant with the recent estimations derived from the flux ratio at
1500 angstrom to 900 angstrom of LAEs and LBGs. Combining the resultant escape
fractions with the luminosity functions of LAEs and LBGs, we find that high-z
LAEs and LBGs can ionize the IGM at z=3-5. However, ionizing radiation from
LAEs as well as LBGs falls short to ionize the IGM at z>6. That implies that
additional ionization sources may required at z>6.

Reusing software components, which are well tested, can be a good solution to
develop software applications in effective manner. The reuse of software
components is less expensive and less time consuming than a development from

together without any problems. Software components itself are well tested, of
course, but even if they composed together problems occur. Most problems are
based on interaction respectively communication. Avoiding such errors a
framework has to be developed for analysing software components. That framework

the thermal membrane roughness on the nanometer scale leads to a cooperative
binding of anchored receptor and ligand molecules, since the receptor-ligand
binding smoothens out the membranes and facilitates the formation of additional

towards a joint role of spontaneous and active processes in cell adhesion. The

characterized by effective membrane adhesion potentials that depend on the

  Estimation Errors","To appear in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, Sep. 2009",,,,"cs.IT cs.DM math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Communication systems are usually designed by assuming perfect channel state
information (CSI). However, in many practical scenarios, only a noisy estimate
of the channel is available, which may strongly differ from the true channel.
This imperfect CSI scenario is addressed by introducing the notion of
estimation-induced outage (EIO) capacity. We derive a single-letter
characterization of the maximal EIO rate and prove an associated coding theorem
and its strong converse for discrete memoryless channels (DMCs). The
transmitter and the receiver rely on the channel estimate and the statistics of
the estimate to construct codes that guarantee reliable communication with a
certain outage probability. This ensures that in the non-outage case the
transmission meets the target rate with small error probability, irrespective
of the quality of the channel estimate. Applications of the EIO capacity to a
single-antenna (non-ergodic) Ricean fading channel are considered. The EIO
capacity for this case is compared to the EIO rates of a communication system
in which the receiver decodes by using a mismatched ML decoder. The effects of
rate-limited feedback to provide the transmitter with quantized CSI are also
investigated.

time series with applications to volatility modeling for financial data. The
approach is based on the assumption of local homogeneity: for every time point,
there exists a historical interval of homogeneity, in which the volatility
parameter can be well approximated by a constant. The proposed procedure
recovers this interval from the data using the local change point (LCP)
analysis. Afterward, the estimate of the volatility can be simply obtained by
local averaging. The approach carefully addresses the question of choosing the
tuning parameters of the procedure using the so-called ``propagation''
condition. The main result claims a new ``oracle'' inequality in terms of the
modeling bias which measures the quality of the local constant approximation.
This result yields the optimal rate of estimation for smooth and piecewise
constant volatility functions. Then, the new procedure is applied to some data
sets and a comparison with a standard GARCH model is also provided. Finally, we
discuss applications of the new method to the Value at Risk problem. The
numerical results demonstrate a very reasonable performance of the new method.

not to be simply proportional to the spin momentum in these situations. The

permanent of a {0,1} matrix can be approximated in randomized polynomial time
by using a rapidly mixing Markov chain. A separate strand of the literature has
pursued the possibility of an alternate, purely algebraic, polynomial-time
approximation scheme. These schemes work by replacing each 1 with a random
element of an algebra A, and considering the determinant of the resulting
matrix. When A is noncommutative, this determinant can be defined in several
ways. We show that for estimators based on the conventional determinant, the
critical ratio of the second moment to the square of the first--and therefore
the number of trials we need to obtain a good estimate of the permanent--is (1
+ O(1/d))^n when A is the algebra of d by d matrices. These results can be
extended to group algebras, and semi-simple algebras in general. We also study
the symmetrized determinant of Barvinok, showing that the resulting estimator
has small variance when d is large enough. However, for constant d--the only
case in which an efficient algorithm is known--we show that the critical ratio
exceeds 2^{n} / n^{O(d)}. Thus our results do not provide a new polynomial-time
approximation scheme for the permanent. Indeed, they suggest that the algebraic
approach to approximating the permanent faces significant obstacles.
  We obtain these results using diagrammatic techniques in which we express
matrix products as contractions of tensor products. When these matrices are
random, in either the Haar measure or the Gaussian measure, we can evaluate the
trace of these products in terms of the cycle structure of a suitably random
permutation. In the symmetrized case, our estimates are then derived by a
connection with the character theory of the symmetric group.

experimental powerspectra of Brownian motion. We demonstrate here that if this
is done with typical weighted least-squares methods the result is a bias of
relative size between -2/n and +1/n on the value of the fitted diffusion
coefficient. Here n is the number of power-spectra averaged over, so typical
calibrations contain 10-20% bias. Both the sign and the size of the bias
depends on the weighting scheme applied. Hence, so do length-scale calibrations
based on the diffusion coefficient. The fitted value for the characteristic
frequency is not affected by this bias. For the AFM then, force measurements
are not affected provided an independent length-scale calibration is available.
For optical-tweezers there is no such luck, since the spring constant is found
as the ratio of the characteristic frequency and the diffusion coefficient. We
give analytical results for the weight-dependent bias for the wide class of
systems whose dynamics is described by a linear (integro-)differential equation
with additive noise, white or colored. Examples are optical tweezers with
hydrodynamic self-interaction and aliasing, calibration of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
models in finance, models for cell-migration in biology, etc. Because the bias
takes the form of a simple multiplicative factor on the fitted amplitude (e.g.
the diffusion coefficient) it is straightforward to remove, and the user will
need minimal modifications to his or her favorite least-square fitting
programs. Results are demonstrated and illustrated using synthetic data, so we
can compare fits with known true values. We also fit some commonly occurring
power spectra once-and-for-all in the sense that we give their parameter values

  Ethanol and their mixture",,,,,"physics.chem-ph physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Transport properties of liquid methanol and ethanol are predicted by
molecular dynamics simulation. The molecular models for the alcohols are rigid,
non-polarizable and of united-atom type. They were developed in preceding work
using experimental vapor-liquid equilibrium data only. Self- and Maxwell-Stefan
diffusion coefficients as well as the shear viscosity of methanol, ethanol and
their binary mixture are determined using equilibrium molecular dynamics and
the Green-Kubo formalism. Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics is used for
predicting the thermal conductivity of the two pure substances. The transport
properties of the fluids are calculated over a wide temperature range at
ambient pressure and compared with experimental and simulation data from the
literature. Overall, a very good agreement with the experiment is found. For
instance, the self-diffusion coefficient and the shear viscosity are predicted
with average deviations of less 8% for the pure alcohols and 12% for the
mixture. The predicted thermal conductivity agrees in average within 5% with
the experimental data. Additionally, some velocity and shear viscosity
autocorrelation functions are presented and discussed. Radial distribution
functions for ethanol are also presented. The predicted excess volume, excess
enthalpy and the vapor-liquid equilibrium of the binary mixture methanol +
ethanol are assessed and the vapor-liquid equilibrium agree well with
experimental data.

The reconstruction of the position of an acoustic point source in the sea is
performed by using small-volume clusters of hydrophones (about 1 cubic meter)
for direction reconstruction by a beamforming algorithm. The directional
information from a number of such clusters allows for position reconstruction.
The algorithms for data filtering, direction and position reconstruction are

translating each second-order system into the corresponding LTT, and proving
that these translations are conservative. This is part of an ongoing research

  The two LTTs we construct are subsystems of the logic-enriched type theory
LTTW, which is intended to formalise the classical predicative foundation

also been claimed to correspond to Weyl's foundation. By casting ACAO and ACA
as LTTs, we are able to compare them with LTTW. It is a consequence of the work
in this paper that LTTW is strictly stronger than ACAO.
  The conservativity proof makes use of a novel technique for proving one LTT
conservative over another, involving defining an interpretation of the stronger
system out of the expressions of the weaker. This technique should be
applicable in a wide variety of different cases outside the present work.

frequencies. A drop in the fractional polarisation appeared in the radio
emission when observing at frequencies below about 2 GHz. Rotation measures

about -20 rad/m**2} found for 3C138 to 3900 rad/m**2 in 3C119. In all cases,
the lambda**2 law is closely followed. The presence of a foreground screen as
predicted by the Tribble model or with ``partial coverage'' as defined by
ourselves can explain the polarimetric behaviour of the CSS sources detected in
polarisation by the present observations. Indication of repolarisation at lower
frequencies was found for some sources. A case of possible variability in the
fractional polarisation is also suggested. The most unexpected result was found
for the distribution of the fractional polarisations versus the linear sizes of

histories in a standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. A large ensemble of Monte Carlo

representative set of dark matter particles, which we assume to be neutralinos.
The first generation halos of most particles do not have a mass similar to the
free-streaming cut-off $M_{f.s.}$ of the neutralino power spectrum, nor do they
form at high redshift. Median values are $M_1 = 10^5$ to $10^7M_{f.s.}$ and
$z_1 = 13$ to 8 depending on the form of the collapse barrier assumed in the
EPS model. For almost a third of all particles the first generation halo has
$M_1>10^9M_{f.s.}$. At redshifts beyond 20, most neutralinos are not yet part
of any halo but are still diffuse. These numbers apply with little modification
to the neutralinos which are today part of halos similar to that of the Milky
Way. Up to 10% of the particles in such halos were never part of a smaller
object; the typical particle has undergone $\sim 5$ ""accretion events' where
the halo it was part of falls into a more massive object. Available N-body
simulations agree well with the EPS predictions for an ""ellipsoidal"" collapse
barrier, so these may provide a reliable extension of simulation results to
smaller scales. The late formation times and large masses of the first
generation halos of most neutralinos imply that they will be disrupted with
high efficiency during halo assembly.

planets is provided by the observations of stellar hot spots rotating
synchronously with the planets and showing an enhancement of chromospheric and
X-ray fluxes. We investigate star-planet interaction in the framework of a
magnetic field model of a stellar corona, considering the interaction between
the coronal field and that of a planetary magnetosphere moving through the
corona. The energy budget of the star-planet interaction is discussed assuming
that the planet may trigger a release of the energy of the coronal field by
decreasing its relative helicity. The observed intermittent character of the
star-planet interaction is explained by a topological change of the stellar
coronal field, induced by a variation of its relative helicity. The model
predicts the formation of many prominence-like structures in the case of highly
active stars owing to the accumulation of matter evaporated from the planet
inside an azimuthal flux rope in the outer corona. Moreover, the model can
explain why stars accompanied by close-in planets have a higher X-ray
luminosity than those with distant planets. It predicts that the best
conditions to detect radio emission from the exoplanets and their host stars
are achieved when the field topology is characterized by field lines connected
to the surface of the star, leading to a chromospheric hot spot rotating
synchronously with the planet. The main predictions of the model can be
verified with present observational techniques, by a simultaneous monitoring of
the chromospheric flux and X-ray (or radio) emission, and spectropolarimetric
observations of the photospheric magnetic fields.

oscillation. Rebinding of MinE to depolymerizing MinD filament tips controls
MinE ring formation through a scaled cell shape parameter $\tilde{r}$. We find
two types of E-ring profiles near the filament tip: a strong plateau-like
E-ring controlled by 1D diffusion of MinE along the bacterial length, or a weak
cusp-like E-ring controlled by 3D diffusion near the filament tip. While the
width of a strong E-ring depends on $\tilde{r}$, the occupation fraction of
MinE at the MinD filament tip is saturated and hence the depolymerization speed
do not depend strongly on $\tilde{r}$. Conversely, for weak E-rings both
$\tilde{r}$ and the MinE to MinD stoichiometry strongly control the tip
occupation and hence the depolymerization speed. MinE rings {\em in vivo} are
close to the threshold between weak and strong, and so MinD-filament
depolymerization speed should be sensitive to cell shape, stoichiometry, and
the MinE-rebinding rate. We also find that the transient to MinE-ring formation
is quite long in the appropriate open geometry for assays of ATPase activity
{\it in vitro}, explaining the long delays of ATPase activity observed for
smaller MinE concentrations in those assays without the need to invoke
cooperative MinE activity.

Our simulated results show obvious shift of hysteresis loops (exchange bias)

rate or increasing the temperature and the number of the field cycling. With
the simulations, we show the exchange bias can be manipulated by controlling
the cooling rate, the distributive width of the anisotropy energy, or the
magnetic coupling constants. Essentially, these two effects can be explained on
the basis of the microscopical coexistence of both reversible and irreversible

understand the magnetization dynamics of such magnetic heterostructures. This

Bogoyavlenskij-Toda lattice. The classification of these systems, up to
iso-energetic topological conjugacy, is related to the classification of
abelian groups of Anosov toral automorphisms by their topological entropy
function.

the incompressible fluid description. It is shown that phase space of
Chern-Simons matrix theory which is an effective theory for the incompressible
fluid is equivalent to moduli space of vortex theory. According to this
correspondence, elementary excitations in vortex theory are identified as
particle states in quantum Hall ferromagnet, and thus we propose that a pure
electron state is absent from the strong coupling region but only a composite
particle state is present.

  metal wires","125 pages, 34 figures, diploma thesis at the MPRG, Erlangen, Germany",,,,"physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work reports on the experimental investigation of surface plasmon
polaritons (SPP) on cylindrical wires of small diameters. Applying a new
technique that was developed by this group and recently reported, single wire
and wire array samples of gold (Au) and silver (Ag) with small diameters 400nm
< D < 3 mum and high aspect ratios <= 75000 in photonic crystal fibers and
single hole capillaries are fabricated. Additionally, effective bulk metal
wires of Au and Ag are created by a hybrid technique, including fiber tapering
and magnetron sputter deposition for a large number of different diameters
between 13 mum to 50 mum.
  The measurement of the absorption, corresponding to the excitation of SPP
modes is realized with a new goniometer-based experimental setup for oblique
incidence laser beam scattering at a single wavelength. A device is developed
that allows a simultaneous measurement of the scattering amplitude in s- and
p-polarization under varied incident angle.
  For comparison, a model for the dispersion of discrete SPP modes and their
angles of excitation is derived. The computed results are for the first time
compared with a theoretical approach to electromagnetic scattering theory for
cylinders, that is calculated analogue to Mie scattering and to an exact
solution of Maxwell's equations for cylindrical SPP. The validity of the model
is proved for higher incident angles. The first oblique incidence examination
of SPP on metal wires for this size range is reported. The experimental results
for low incident angles show good accordance to the numerical results from
scattering theory.
