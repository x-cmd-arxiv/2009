with each other in this system: A molecular superfluid phase in which the three
fermion species pair up to form molecules (trions), a usual pairing phase
involving two species with exactly opposite momenta, and a more exotic
generalized Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase consisting of three
competing pairing tendencies with different non-zero center-of-mass momenta. At
large attractive interactions the system exhibits strong tendencies towards
collapse and phase separation. Employing the

massive YSOs in star-forming regions within a few kpc of the Sun. Here we
report on 2 micron polarimetry of NGC 6334 V and S255 IRS1. NGC 6334 V consists
of a double-lobed bright reflection nebula seen against a dark region, probably
an optically thick molecular cloud. Our polarization measurements show that the
illuminating star lies ~ 2'' south of the line connecting the two lobes; we do
not detect this star at 2 micron, but there are a small radio source and a
mid-infrared source at this location. S255 IRS1 consists of two YSOs (NIRS1 and
NIRS3) with overlapping scattered light lobes and luminosities corresponding to
early B stars. Included in IRS1 is a cluster of stars from whose polarization
we determine the local magnetic field direction. Neither YSO has its scattered
light lobes aligned with this magnetic field. The line connecting the scattered
light lobes of NIRS1 is twisted symmetrically around the star; the best
explanation is that the star is part of a close binary and the outflow axis of
NIRS1 is precessing as a result of non-coplanar disk and orbit. The star NIRS3
is also offset from the line connecting its two scattered light lobes. We
suggest that all three YSOs show evidence of episodic ejection of material as
they accrete from dense, optically thick envelopes.

show systematic differences and often have significants gaps. Our goal is to
obtain a uniform and complete sunspot area time series by combining different
data sets. A homogeneus composite of sunspot areas is essential for different
applications in solar physics, among others for irradiance reconstructions.
Data recorded simultaneously at different observatories are statistically
compared in order to determine the intercalibration factors. Using these data
we compile a complete and cross-calibrated time series. The Greenwich data set
is used as a basis until 1976, the Russian data (a compilation of observations
made at stations in the former USSR) between 1977 and 1985 and data compiled by
the USAF network since 1986. Other data sets (Rome, Yunnan, Catania) are used

and data communication. In multi path time varying environments, it is
necessary to estimate time-shifts, scale-shifts (the wideband equivalent of
Doppler-shifts), and the gains/phases of each of the multiple paths. With
recent advances in sparse estimation (or ""compressive sensing""), new estimation
techniques have emerged which yield more accurate estimates of these channel
parameters than traditional strategies. These estimation strategies, however,
restrict potential estimates of time-shifts and scale-shifts to a finite set of
values separated by a choice of grid spacing. A small grid spacing increases
the number of potential estimates, thus lowering the quantization error, but
also increases complexity and estimation time. Conversely, a large grid spacing
lowers the number of potential estimates, thus lowering the complexity and
estimation time, but increases the quantization error. In this thesis, we
derive an expression which relates the choice of grid spacing to the
mean-squared quantization error. Furthermore, we consider the case when
scale-shifts are approximated by Doppler-shifts, and derive a similar
expression relating the choice of the grid spacing and the quantization error.
Using insights gained from these expressions, we further explore the effects of
the choice and grid spacing, and examine when a wideband model can be well

gravitational binary system with unequal masses moving with arbitrary relative
velocity, taking into account the backreaction from both compact objects in the
form of tidal deformation, gravitational waves and self forces. Allowing all
dynamical variables to interact with each other in a self-consistent manner
this formalism ensures that all the dynamical quantities involved are conserved
on the background spacetime and obey the gauge invariance under general
coordinate transformations that preserve the background geometry. Because it is
based on a generalized perturbation theory and the important new emphasis is on
the self-consistency of all the dynamical variables involved we call it a
gravitational perturbation theory with self-consistent backreaction (GP-SCB).
  As an illustration of how this formalism is implemented we construct
perturbatively a self-consistent set of equations of motion for an inspiraling
gravitational binary, which does not require extra assumptions such as slow
motion, weak-field or small mass ratio for its formulation. This case should
encompass the inspiral and possibly the plunge and merger phases of binaries
with otherwise general parameters (e.g., mass ratio and relative velocity)
though more investigation is needed to substantiate it.
  In the second part, we discuss how the mass ratio can be treated as a
perturbation parameter in the post-Newtonian effective field theory (PN-EFT)
approach, thus extending the work of Goldberger and Rothstein for equal mass
binaries to variable mass ratios. We provide rough estimates for the higher
post-Newtonian orders needed to determine the number of gravitational wave
cycles, with a specified precision, that fall into a detector's bandwidth.

H_{W,G} constructed by Fan, Jarvis, and Ruan, as an A-model, the following
conjecture is obtained: For a quasi-homogeneous singularity W and a group G of
symmetries of W, there is a dual singularity W^T such that the orbifold A-model
of W/G is isomorphic to the B-model of W^T. I will show that this conjecture
holds for a two-dimensional invertible loop potential $W$ with its maximal
group of diagonal symmetries $G_{W}$.

systems where a white dwarf accretes material from a companion star until its
mass approaches the Chandrasekhar mass and carbon is ignited in the white
dwarf's core. This scenario predicts that the donor star should survive the
supernova explosion, providing an opportunity to understand the progenitors of
Type Ia supernovae.In this paper we argue that rotation is a generic signature
expected of most non-giant donor stars that is easily measurable.
\citep{2004Natur.431.1069R} examined stars in the center of the remnant of SN
1572 (Tycho's SN) and showed evidence that a subgiant star (Star G by their
naming convention) near the remnant's centre was the system's donor star. We
present high-resolution (R \simeq 40000) spectra taken with the High Dispersion
Spectrograph on Subaru of this candidate donor star and measure the star's
radial velocity as $79\pm 2$ \kms with respect to the LSR and put an upper
limit on the star's rotation of 7.5 \kms. In addition, by comparing images that
were taken in 1970 and 2004, we measure the proper motion of Star G to be
$\mu_l = -1.6 \pm 2.1$ \masyr and $\mu_b = -2.7 \pm 1.6$ \masyr. We demonstrate
that all of the measured properties of Star G presented in this paper are
consistent with those of a star in the direction of Tycho's SN that is not
associated with the supernova event. However, we discuss an unlikely, but still
viable scenario for Star G to be the donor star, and suggest further
observations that might be able to confirm or refute it.

naturally from the formation of molecules in the cold phase of a two-phase

systems where the ultraviolet radiation field is dominated by the extragalactic
background and in dense star-forming ones, where the local radiation field is
likely to be orders of magnitude higher. We point out that such a
radiation-insensitive model is required to explain the absence of high column -
high metallicity systems among DLAs observed using gamma-ray burst afterglows,
since these are likely subjected to strong radiation fields created by active
star formation in the GRB host galaxy. Moreover, we show that the observed
relationship between the maximum atomic gas column in DLAs sets a firm upper
limit on the fraction of the mass in these systems that can be in the warm,
diffuse phase. Finally, we argue that our result explains the observed lack of
in situ star formation in DLA systems.

there is a minimum achievable temperature above zero. Such a gap, combined with
a negligible amount of noise, prevents adiabatic following during the
demagnetization stage which is the necessary condition for reaching $T_c \to
0$. The refrigerator is based on an Otto cycle where the working medium is an
interacting spin system with an energy gap. For this system the external
control Hamiltonian does not commute with the internal interaction. As a result
during the demagnetization and magnetization segments of the operating cycle
the system cannot follow adiabatically the temporal change in the energy
levels. We connect the nonadiabatic dynamics to quantum friction. An adiabatic
measure is defined characterizing the rate of change of the Hamiltonian. Closed
form solutions are found for a constant adiabatic measure for all the cycle
segments. We have identified a family of quantized frictionless cycles with
increasing cycle times. These cycles minimize the entropy production. Such
frictionless cycles are able to cool to $T_c=0$. External noise on the controls
eliminates these frictionless cycles. The influence of phase and amplitude
noise on the demagnetization and magnetization segments is explicitly derived.
An extensive numerical study of optimal cooling cycles was carried out which
showed that at sufficiently low temperature the noise always dominates

formation activity and the degree to which neighbouring galaxies rotation axes

derived with MOPED, and spin direction (chirality), as determined by the Galaxy
Zoo project, for a sample of SDSS galaxies. Our findings suggest that spiral
galaxies which formed the majority of their stars early (z > 2) tend to display
coherent rotation over scales of ~10 Mpc/h. The correlation is weaker for
galaxies with significant recent star formation. We find evidence for this
alignment at more than the 5-sigma level, but no correlation with other galaxy
stellar properties. This finding can be explained within the context of
hierarchical tidal-torque theory if the SDSS galaxies harboring the majority of
the old stellar population where formed in the past, in the same filament and
at about the same time. Galaxies with significant recent star formation instead
are in the field, thus influenced by the general tidal field that will align
them in random directions or had a recent merger which would promote star
formation, but deviate the spin direction.

estimation is a vital step towards being able to fully utilize the data of
next-generation surveys within precision cosmology. In this paper we apply a
specific approach to spectral connectivity analysis (SCA; Lee & Wasserman 2009)
called diffusion map. SCA is a class of non-linear techniques for transforming
observed data (e.g., photometric colours for each galaxy, where the data lie on
a complex subset of p-dimensional space) to a simpler, more natural coordinate
system wherein we apply regression to make redshift predictions. As SCA relies
upon eigen-decomposition, our training set size is limited to ~ 10,000
galaxies; we use the Nystrom extension to quickly estimate diffusion
coordinates for objects not in the training set. We apply our method to 350,738
SDSS main sample galaxies, 29,816 SDSS luminous red galaxies, and 5,223
galaxies from DEEP2 with CFHTLS ugriz photometry. For all three datasets, we
achieve prediction accuracies on par with previous analyses, and find that use
of the Nystrom extension leads to a negligible loss of prediction accuracy
relative to that achieved with the training sets. As in some previous analyses
(e.g., Collister & Lahav 2004, Ball et al. 2008), we observe that our
predictions are generally too high (low) in the low (high) redshift regimes. We
demonstrate that this is a manifestation of attenuation bias, wherein
measurement error (i.e., uncertainty in diffusion coordinates due to
uncertainty in the measured fluxes/magnitudes) reduces the slope of the
best-fit regression line. Mitigation of this bias is necessary if we are to use
photometric redshift estimates produced by computationally efficient empirical
methods in precision cosmology.

the single-period mean-variance efficient frontier is a straight line tangent

In this paper, it is shown that in a continuous-time market where the risky
prices are described by Ito's processes and the investment opportunity set is
deterministic (albeit time-varying), any efficient portfolio must involve
allocation to the risk-free asset at any time. As a result, the dynamic
mean-variance efficient frontier, though still a straight line, is strictly
above the entire risky region. This in turn suggests a positive premium, in
terms of the Sharpe ratio of the efficient frontier, arising from the dynamic
trading. Another implication is that the inclusion of a risk-free asset boosts
the Sharpe ratio of the efficient frontier, which again contrasts sharply with
the single-period case.

In analogy to charge currents, we can identify two reciprocal effects:
spin-transfer torque on the magnetic order parameter induced by energy current
and the Berry-phase gauge field induced energy flow. In addition, we
phenomenologically introduce new $\beta-$like viscous coupling between magnetic
dynamics and energy current into the LLG equation, which originates from spin
mistracking of the magnetic order. We conclude that the new viscous term should
be important for the thermally induced domain wall motion. We study the
interplay between charge and energy currents and find that many of the effects
of texture motion on the charge currents can be replicated with respect to
energy currents. For example, the moving texture can lead to energy flows which
is an analogue of the electromotive force in case of charge currents. We
suggest a realization of cooling effect by magnetic texture dynamics.

standard 6-parameter LCDM model, the addition of QUaD data marginally improves
the constraints on a number of cosmological parameters over those obtained from
the WMAP experiment alone. The impact of QUaD data is significantly greater for
a model extended to include either a running in the scalar spectral index, or a
possible tensor component, or both. Adding both the QUaD data and the results
from the ACBAR experiment, the uncertainty in the spectral index running is
reduced by ~25% compared to WMAP alone, while the upper limit on the
tensor-to-scalar ratio is reduced from r < 0.48 to r < 0.33 (95% c.l). This is
the strongest limit on tensors to date from the CMB alone. We also use our
polarization measurements to place constraints on parity violating interactions
to the surface of last scattering, constraining the energy scale of Lorentz

probed, but are significantly lower for the higher Fe-metallicity Draco stars.
For the explosive alpha-elements Ca and Ti, the abundance ratios for Draco
giants with [Fe/H] > -2.4 dex are approximately constant and slightly
sub-solar, well below values characteristic of Galactic halo stars. The
s-process contribution to the production of heavy elements begins at
significantly lower Fe-metallicity than in the Galactic halo.
  Using a toy model we compare the behavior of the abundance ratios within the
sample of Draco giants with those from the literature of Galactic globular
clusters, and the Carina and Sgr dSph galaxies. The differences appear to be
related to the timescale for buildup of the heavy elements, with Draco having
the slowest rate.
  We note the presence of a Draco giant with [Fe/H] < -3.0 dex in our sample,
and reaffirm that the inner Galactic halo could have been formed by early
accretion of Galactic satellite galaxies and dissolution of young globular
clusters, while the outer halo could have formed from those satellite galaxies
accreted later.

compared to the one previously derived by Bender et al.. The puzzling
observations of both manuscripts are reconciled and explained in the present
manuscript as follows: the actual form of the metric operator (and the induced
C-operator) related to some non-Hermitian Hamilton operator constructed along
the lines of Shi and Su depends on the chosen normalization of the left and
right eigenvectors of the Hamilton operator under consideration and is
therefore ambiguous. For a specific PT-symmetric 2x2-matrix Hamilton operator
it is shown that - by a suitable choice of the norm of its eigenvectors - the
metric operator yielding a positive semi-definite inner product can be made
even independent of the parameters of the considered Hamilton operator. This
surprising feature makes in turn the obtained metric operator rather unique and
attractive. For later convenience the metric operator for the Bosonic and
Fermionic (anti)causal harmonic oscillator is derived.

kinematics and dynamics in actively star-forming galaxies. In addition, ScUVLGs
appear to be excellent analogs to high redshift Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) and
our results may offer additional insight into the dynamics of LBGs. Previous
work by our team has shown that the morphologies of these galaxies exhibit
tidal features and companions, and in this study we find that the dynamics of
ScUVLGs are dominated by disturbed kinematics of the emission line gas--
suggestive that these galaxies have undergone recent feedback, interactions or
mergers. While 2 of the 3 galaxies do display rotation, v/sigma < 1 --
suggesting dispersion dominated kinematics rather than smooth rotation. We also
simulate how these observations would appear at z~2. Lower resolution and loss
of low surface brightness features causes some apparent discrepancies between
the low-z (observed) and high-z (simulated) interpretations and quantitatively
gives different values for v/sigma, yet simulations of these low-z analogs
manage to detect the brightest regions well and resemble actual high-z

self-gravitating discs, as previously suggested by the idealised simulations of
Rice et al, then in realistic protostellar discs, this process will be
restricted to the outer regions of the disc (i.e. at radii in excess of several
tens of A.U.). This restriction relates to the requirement that dust has to be
concentrated in spiral features on a timescale that is less than the (roughly
dynamical) lifetime of such features, and that such rapid accumulation requires
spiral features whose fractional amplitude is not much less than unity. This in
turn requires that the cooling timescale of the gas is relatively short, which
restricts the process to the outer disc. We point out that the efficient
conversion of a large fraction of the primordial dust in the disc into
planetesimals could rescue this material from the well known problem of rapid
inward migration at a $\sim$ metre size scale and that in principle the
collisional evolution of these objects could help to re-supply small dust to
the protostellar disc. We also point out the possible implications of this
scenario for the location of planetesimal belts inferred in debris discs around
main sequence stars, but stress that further dynamical studies are required in
order to establish whether the disc retains a memory of the initial site of
planetesimal creation.

effect in solid $^4$He, suggested by Leggett, indicates supersolid behavior, we
make a number of remarks about both theory and experiment. (1) The
long-wavelength, low-frequency (""hydrodynamic"") part of the theory of Andreev
and Lifshitz has nine variables, and thus must have nine modes. We find a new
mode associated with lattice point diffusion (and thus vacancy diffusion); it
may explain the absence of supersolid behavior in low-frequency pressure-driven
flow. (2) The observed upper limit for the NCRI fraction (NCRIf) of about 20%,
in disordered samples, is more-or-less the same as the already predicted upper
limit for the superfluid fraction of a well-ordered crystal; we argue that this
may not be a coincidence. (3) The negative experimental evidence for a second
propagating hydrodynamic mode (expected to be fourth sound-like) may be due to
the long relaxation times $\tau$ at low temperature $T$; only for frequencies
satisfying $\omega\tau\ll1$ does the hydrodynamic theory apply. (4) The
fundamental principles of quantum mechanics imply that Bose-Einstein
condensation is not necessary to define a quantum-mechanical phase; therefore
the absence of a finite condensate fraction $f_{0}$ does not necessarily imply
the absence of superfluidity. (5) Just as vortices should avoid occupied
lattice sites to provide a vortex-lattice interaction, the lattice should
interact with the vortices to provide a lattice-vortex interaction; thus
dislocations should interact with vortices, whose motion is affected by
rotation. We discuss some experimental implications for the vortex liquid
model, shear response, hysteresis, and relaxation.

note we cover $R$-modules by proper submodules for commutative rings $R$,
thereby subsuming and recovering both cases above. Specifically, we study the
smallest cardinal number $\aleph$, possibly infinite, such that a given
$R$-module is a union of $\aleph$-many proper submodules. (1) We completely
characterize when $\aleph$ is a finite cardinal; this parallels for modules a
1954 result of Neumann. (2) We also compute the covering (cardinal) numbers of

CO line profiles are spectrally resolved, permitting direct calculation of CO
oxygen isotopologue ratios with 5-10% accuracy. The ro-vibrational level
populations for all species can be reproduced by assuming that CO absorption
arises in two temperature regimes. For both objects, 12C/13C are on the order
of 100, nearly twice the expected interstellar medium (ISM) ratio. The derived
oxygen abundance ratios for the VV CrA disk show a significant mass-independent
deficit of C17O and C18O relative to C16O compared to ISM baseline abundances.
The Reipurth 50 envelope shows no clear differences in oxygen CO isotopologue
ratios compared with the local ISM. A mass-independent fractionation can be
interpreted as being due to selective photodissociation of CO in the disk
surface due to self-shielding. The deficits in C17O$ and C18O$ in the VV CrA
protoplanetary disk are consistent with an analogous origin of the 16O
variability in the solar system by isotope selective photodissociation,
confirmation of which may be obtained via study of additional sources. The
higher fractionation observed for the VV CrA disk compared with the Reipurth 50
envelope is likely due to a combination of disk geometry, grain growth, and
vertical mixing processes. [Abstract abridged]

leaky, so that ionizing photons from inside the bubble excite free-free

the extended low density HII regions described by Mezger (1978). Half the

halos for non-Gaussian initial conditions. We use a steepest-descent approach
to point out that exact results can be obtained for the high-mass tail of the
halo mass function and the two-point correlation of massive halos. Focusing on
primordial non-Gaussianity of the local type, we check that these results agree
with numerical simulations. The high-mass cutoff of the halo mass function
takes the same form as the one obtained from the Press-Schechter formalism, but
with a linear threshold $\delta_L$ that depends on the definition of the halo.
We show that a simple formula, which obeys this high-mass asymptotic and uses
the fit obtained for Gaussian initial conditions, matches numerical simulations
while keeping the mass function normalized to unity. Next, by deriving the
real-space halo two-point correlation in the spirit of Kaiser (1984) and taking
a Fourier transform, we obtain good agreement with simulations for the
correction to the halo bias due to primordial non-Gaussianity. Therefore,
neither the halo mass function nor the bias require an ad-hoc parameter $q$
provided one uses the correct linear threshold $\delta_L$ and pays attention to
halo displacements. The nonlinear real-space expression can be useful for
checking that the ""linearized"" bias is a valid approximation. Moreover, it
clearly shows how the baryon acoustic oscillation at $\sim 100 h^{-1}$Mpc is
amplified by the bias of massive halos and modified by primordial
non-Gaussianity. On smaller scales, the correction to the real-space bias
roughly scales as $\fNL \, b_M(\fNL=0) \, x^2$. The low-$k$ behavior of the
halo bias does not imply a divergent real-space correlation, so that one does
not need to introduce counterterms that depend on the survey size.

laws of gases and the quantum mechanical description of molecules of an ideal

molecule can be considered independently on all other molecules, and thus the
macroscopic parameters of the ideal gas, like pressure P and temperature T, can
be introduced as a result of simple averaging over all individual motions of
the molecules. It was shown that for an ideal gas enclosed in a macroscopic
cubic box of volume V, the constant, arising along with the classical law of
adiabatic expansion, i.e. PV5/3=constant, can be explicitly derived based on
quantum mechanics, so that the constant comes to be proportional to h^2/m; here
h is the Planck Constant, and m is the relativistic mass of the molecule the
gas is made of. In this article we show that the same holds for a photon gas,
although the related setup is quite different than the previous ideal gas
setup. At any rate, we come out with PV5/3 hc=constant, where c is the speed of
light. No matter what the dimensions of the constants in question are different
from each other, they are still rooted to universal constants, more
specifically to h2 and to hc, respectively; their ratio, i.e. V1/3 h/mc,
interestingly pointing to the de Broglie relationship's cast.

effects. Indeed, their inclusion is crucial since the sources in M31
microlensing events are mainly giant stars. Light curves with detectable
planetary features are selected by looking for significant deviations from the
corresponding Paczy\'{n}ski shapes. We find that the time scale of planetary
deviations in light curves increase (up to 3-4 days) as the source size
increases. This means that only few exposures per day, depending also on the
required accuracy, may be sufficient to reveal in the light curve a planetary
companion. Although the mean planet mass for the selected events is about $2
M_{\rm {Jupiter}}$, even small mass planets ($M_{\rm P} < 20 M_{\oplus}$) can
cause significant deviations, at least in the observations with large
telescopes. However, even in the former case, the probability to find
detectable planetary features in pixel-lensing light curves is at most a few
percent of the detectable events, and therefore many events have to be
collected in order to detect an extrasolar planet in M31. Our analysis also

affine braided geometry related to the so-called Reflection Equation Algebra
(REA). All objects of such type geometry are defined in the spirit of affine
algebraic geometry via polynomial relations on generators.
  We begin with comparing the Poisson counterparts of ""quantum varieties"" and
describe different approaches to their quantization. Also, we exhibit two
approaches to introducing q-analogs of vector bundles and defining the
Chern-Connes index for them on quantum spheres. In accordance with the
Serre-Swan approach, the q-vector bundles are treated as finitely generated
projective modules over the corresponding quantum algebras.
  Besides, we describe the basic properties of the REA used in this
construction and compare different ways of defining q-analogs of partial
derivatives and differentials on the REA and algebras close to them. In
particular, we present a way of introducing a q-differential calculus via
Koszul type complexes. The lements of the q-calculus are applied to defining

dynamics characterizing prescribed ideal fluids (i.e., continua), which is
related to the dynamics of so-called \textit{ideal tracer particles} moving in
the same fluids. These are by definition particles of infinitesimal size which
do not produce significant perturbations of the fluid fields and do not
interact among themselves. In this work we point out that the phase-space
Lagrangian description of incompressible Navier-Stokes fluids can be achieved
by means of a particular subset of ideal tracer particles, denoted as thermal
particles. For these particles the magnitude of their relative velocities -
with respect to the local fluid velocity - is solely determined by the kinetic
pressure, in turn, uniquely related to the fluid pressure. The dynamics of
thermal tracer particles is shown to generate the time-evolution of the fluid
fields by means of a suitable statistical model. The result is reached
introducing a 1-D statistical description of the fluid exclusively based on the
ensemble of thermal tracer particles. In particular, it is proven that the
statistic of thermal particles can be uniquely defined requiring that for these
particles the directions of their initial relative velocities are defined by a
suitable family of random coplanar unit vectors.

with the polarization spectrum taken at 6 days before the second maximum (Maund
et al. 2007a), enable us to closely examine the intrinsic properties of the SN.
The polarization percentage is smaller at the later epoch over a wide
wavelength range, while the position angle is similar at the two epochs. We
find that an assumption of complete depolarization of strong lines at the
emission peak is not necessarily correct. The intrinsic polarization of the SN
is larger, and thus, the ejecta of SN 2005bf would be more asymmetric than
previously expected. The axis ratio of the photosphere projected on the sky
deviates from unity by at least 20 %. If the position angle of interstellar
polarization is aligned with the spiral arm of the host galaxy, the deviation
is larger than 25 %. The line polarization at the He I, Ca II and Fe II lines
is also smaller at the later epoch. The changes in the position angle across
these lines, which were observed at the earlier epoch, are still marginally
present at the later epoch. The similar polarimetric behavior suggests that the
distributions of these ions are correlated. Properties of polarization, as well
as the light curve and the spectra both at photospheric and nebular phases, can
be explained by an aspherical, possibly unipolar explosion of a WN star in
which the blob of 56Ni penetrates C+O core and stops within the He layer.

related features from the near-IR images, and combined them with images
previously obtained with HST in the R band and by a re-analysis of VLA radio

near-IR, and optical wavelengths. The broad--band emission of the jet knots is
dominated by synchrotron radiation, while the nucleus also exhibits a
significant inverse Compton component. We discovered the near-IR counterpart of

synchrotron emission from radio to X-ray. The bright red object (red-tip),
detached but well aligned with the jet, is well resolved in the near-IR and has

for the radio flux density. In radio, we revisited ATCA data and used HI and
mid-infrared observations to disentangle the thermal from the non-thermal
emission. In X-rays, we produced a new mosaic of the remnant and degraded the
spatial resolution of the X-ray data to the resolution of the HESS instrument
to perform spatially resolved spectroscopy at the same spatial scale in X- and
gamma-rays. Radial profiles were obtained to investigate the extension of the
emission at both energies.
  We found that part of the radio emission within the SNR contours is thermal
in nature. Taking this into account, we provide new lower and upper limits for
the integrated synchrotron flux of the remnant at 1.4 GHz of 22 Jy and 26 Jy
respectively. In X-rays, we obtained the first full coverage of RX J1713.7-3946
with XMM-Newton. The spatial variation of the photon index seen at small scale
in X-rays is smeared out at HESS resolution. A non-linear correlation between
the X- and gamma-ray fluxes of the type Fx \propto Fg^2.41 is found.

entropy. To consider computation as a physical process from an initial instance
to the final acceptance is motivated because many natural processes have been
recognized to complete in non-polynomial time (NP). The irreversible process
with three or more degrees of freedom is found intractable because, in terms of
physics, flows of energy are inseparable from their driving forces. In
computational terms, when solving problems in the class NP, decisions will
affect subsequently available sets of decisions. The state space of a
non-deterministic finite automaton is evolving due to the computation itself
hence it cannot be efficiently contracted using a deterministic finite
automaton that will arrive at a solution in super-polynomial time. The solution
of the NP problem itself is verifiable in polynomial time (P) because the
corresponding state is stationary. Likewise the class P set of states does not
depend on computational history hence it can be efficiently contracted to the
accepting state by a deterministic sequence of dissipative transformations.
Thus it is concluded that the class P set of states is inherently smaller than
the set of class NP. Since the computational time to contract a given set is
proportional to dissipation, the computational complexity class P is a subset
of NP.

accelerated in opposite directions are summarized and its limits are
considered. A particular attention is paid to the special-relativistic limit in
which the electromagnetic field becomes the ""magic field"" of two oppositely
accelerated rotating charged relativistic discs. When the acceleration vanishes
the usual electromagnetic magic field of the Kerr-Newman black hole with
gravitational constant set to zero arises. Properties of the accelerated discs
and the fields produced are studied and illustrated graphically. The charges at
the rim of the accelerated discs move along spiral trajectories with the speed
of light. If the magic field has some deeper connection with the field of the
Dirac electron, as is sometimes conjectured because of the same gyromagnetic
ratio, the ""accelerating magic field"" represents the electromagnetic field of a
uniformly accelerated spinning electron. It generalizes the classical Born's
solution for two uniformly accelerated monopole charges.

We speculate that this may indeed be the case. We recall the similarity between
evolution of classical and quantum mechanical ensembles, according to Liouville
and von Neumann equation, respectively. The classical and quantum mechanical
equations are indistinguishable for objects which are free or subject to
spatially constant but possibly time dependent, or harmonic forces, if
represented appropriately. This result suggests a way to incorporate anharmonic
interactions, including fluctuations which are tentatively related to the
underlying discreteness of spacetime. Being linear and local at the quantum
mechanical level, the model offers a decoherence and natural localization
mechanism. However, the relation to primordial deterministic degrees of freedom
is nonlocal.

one from the equation of motion. We present a quantitative approach to this

location of A depends on the type of motion experienced by the body. In
particular, in vertical translation, from the work-energy viewpoint, this point
is fixed with respect to the centre of gravity G of the body. In contrast, in
rolling/pitching motion there is duality in the location of A ; indeed, the
work-energy relation implies A to be fixed with respect to the centre of
buoyancy C, while from considerations involving the rotational moment it
follows that A is located at the metacentre M. We obtain analytical expressions
of the location of M for a general shape of the immersed cross-section of the
floating body and for an arbitrary angle of heel. We show that three different
definitions of M viz., the ?geometrical? one, as the centre of curvature of the
buoyancy curve, the Bouguer's one, involving the moment of inertia of the plane
of flotation, and the ?dynamical? one, involving the second derivative of the
hydrostatic energy, refer to one and the same special point, and we demonstrate

quantifications of uncertainty are also needed. One way to accomplish this is
to provide multiple simulations of the relevant meteorological quantities

a high-quality dataset of minute-by-minute measurements of atmospheric pressure

carrying out these conditional simulations. Based on observations at 11
stations, conditional simulations were produced at two other sites with
monitoring stations. The resulting point predictions are very accurate and the
multiple simulations produce well-calibrated prediction uncertainties for
temporal changes in atmospheric pressure but are substantially overconservative

In this paper, we report the complete demonstration of a 3-D DFI. The DFI
consists of four Mach-Zehnder interferometers with four mirrors and two
beamsplitters. The displacement noises both of mirrors and beamsplitters were
suppressed by up to 40 dB. The non-vanishing DFI response to a gravitational
wave was successfully confirmed using multiple electro-optic modulators and
computing methods.

some constrains on the time scale of the massive star formation: sulphur
chemistry is of specific interest due to its rapid evolution in warm gas and
because the abundance of sulphur bearing species increases significantly with
the temperature. Two mid-infrared quiet and two brighter massive cores are
observed in various transitions (E_up up to 289K) of CS, OCS, H2S, SO, SO2 and
of their isotopologues at mm wavelengths with the IRAM 30m and CSO telescopes.
1D modeling of the dust continuum is used to derive the density and temperature
laws, which are then applied in the RATRAN code to model the observed line
emission, and to derive the relative abundances of the molecules. All lines,
except the highest energy SO2 transition, are detected. Infall (up to 2.9km/s)
may be detected towards the core W43MM1. The inferred mass rate is 5.8-9.4
10^{-2} M_{\odot}/yr. We propose an evolutionary sequence of our sources
(W43MM1-IRAS18264-1152-IRAS05358+3543-IRAS18162-2048), based on the SED
analysis. The analysis of the variations in abundance ratios from source to
source reveals that the SO and SO2 relative abundances increase with time,
while CS and OCS decrease. Molecular ratios, such as [OCS/H2S], [CS/H2S],
[SO/OCS], [SO2/OCS], [CS/SO] and [SO2/SO] may be good indicators of evolution
depending on layers probed by the observed molecular transitions. Observations
of molecular emission from warmer layers, hence involving higher upper energy

survey of the nearest very rich cluster of galaxies, covering a range of galaxy
density environments. The imaging is complemented by a recent wide field
redshift survey of the cluster conducted with Hectospec on the 6.5m MMT. Among
the many scientific applications for this data are the search for compact
galaxies. In this paper, we present the discovery of seven compact (but quite
luminous) stellar systems, ranging from M32-like galaxies down to ultra-compact
dwarfs (UCDs)/dwarf to globular transition objects (DGTOs). We find that all
seven compact galaxies require a two-component fit to their light profile and
have measured velocity dispersions that exceed those expected for typical
early-type galaxies at their luminosity. From our structural parameter analysis
we conclude that three of the sample should be classified as compact
ellipticals or M32-like galaxies, the remaining four being less extreme
systems. The three compact ellipticals are all found to have old luminosity
weighted ages (> 12 Gyr), intermediate metallicities (-0.6 < [Fe/H] < -0.1) and
high [Mg/Fe] (> 0.25). Our findings support a tidal stripping scenario as the
formation mode of compact galaxies covering the luminosity range studied here.
We speculate that at least two early-type morphologies may serve as the
progenitor of compact galaxies in clusters.

dynamical friction and baryon adiabatic contraction in order to obtain a
secondary infall model more close to the collapse reality. The model is applied
to structures on galactic scales (normal and dwarf spiral galaxies) and on
cluster of galaxies scales. The results obtained suggest that angular momentum
and dynamical friction are able, on galactic scales, to overcome the competing
effect of adiabatic contraction eliminating the cusp. The NFW profile can be
reobtained, in our model only if the system is constituted just by dark matter
and the magnitude of angular momentum and dynamical friction are reduced with
respect to the values predicted by the model itself. The rotation curves of
four LSB galaxies from de Blok & Bosma (2002) are compared to the rotation
curves obtained by the model in the present paper obtaining a good fit to the
observational data. On scales smaller than $\simeq 10^{11} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$
the slope $\alpha \simeq 0$ and on cluster scales we observe a similar
evolution of the dark matter density profile but in this case the density
profile slope flattens to $\alpha \simeq 0.6$ for a cluster of $\simeq 10^{14}
h^{-1} M_{\odot}$. The total mass profile, differently from that of dark
matter, shows a central cusp well fitted by a NFW model.

deal with the discrete ratings on objects, we use a multi-channel

of channels being equal to the number of different ratings. Each channel
represents a certain rating and a user having voted an object will be connected
to the channel corresponding to the rating. Diffusion process taking place on
such a user-channel bipartite graph gives a new similarity measure of user
pairs, which is further demonstrated to be more accurate than the classical
Pearson correlation coefficient under the standard collaborative filtering
framework.

  English",,"10.1134/S1063776109080044",,"physics.class-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While he derived the equation for the radiation force, Dirac (1938) mentioned
a possibility to use different choices for the 4-momentum of an emitting
electron. Particularly, the 4-momentum could be non-colinear to the electron
4-velocity. This ambiguity in the electron 4-momentum allows us to assume that
the mass of emitting electron may be an operator, or, at least, a 4-tensor
instead of being the usually assumed scalar, which relates the 4-velocity of a
bare charge to the total momentum of a dressed point electron, the latter being
a total of the momentum of the bare electron and that of the own
electromagnetic field.
  On applying the re-normalization procedure to the mass operator, we arrive at
an interesting dichotomy. The first choice (more close to traditional one)
ensures the radiation force to be orthogonal to the 4-velocity. In this way the
re-normalization results in the Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac equation or in the
Eliezer equation. However, the 4-momentum of electron in this case is not well
defined: the equality in the relativistic entity (E/c)^2=m^2c^2+p^2 appears to
be broken and even the energy is not definite positive. The latter is an
underlying reason for the 'run-away' solution.
  The other choice is to require the radiation force to be orthogonal to the
4-momentum (not to the 4-velocity). In this case the energy and momentum are
well-defined and obey the relationship (E/c)^2=m^2c^2+p^2. Remarkably, the
equations of a particle's motion in this case differ significantly from all the
known versions. They appear to be well founded. They are simple, easy to solve,
and can be applied to simulate the particle motion in the focus of an
ultra-bright laser.

considered. It is shown that very fast collapse of the spatial area occupied by
macroscopic polyelectron (or dense electron-positron plasma) produces an
instant annihilation of a very large number of electron-positron pairs. This
phenomenon corresponds to the so-called annihilation explosion. Annihilation of
each electron-positron pair is a highly exothermic process. Therefore, in dense
electron-positron plasma one can observe a very interesting phenomenon of
photon detonation, i.e. a self-organized formation and propagation of the
detonation wave which coincides with the annihilation wave. The photon
detonation can be used in many applications, including many military and
astrophysical problems.

found, in agreement with Cowling anti-dynamo theorem, or slow dynamos [PPL

representation of ${\alpha}^{2}$-dynamo operator. Instead of principal scalar
curvatures ${\kappa}_{1}$ and ${\kappa}_{2}$ of the surface of structures, only
one scalar curvature ${\kappa}$ is needed to determine dynamos spectra.

modulation in underdoped cuprates. The peculiar observations of the above
experiments are located in the so called pseudo-gap region of the phase
diagram, just over the superconducting-dome. The model that will be used
captures in a simple way the idea that the pseudo-gap phase is formed of bound
fermion pairs which are close to a CDW instability but generally do not have
long range order due to quenched disorder. Thus the charge degrees of freedom
will be modeled by an Ising order parameter in the presence of quenched
disorder, so representing a charge glassy phase. This glassy phase will be in
competition with a superconducting phase modeled by a complex order parameter.
As a first step we will study the model in one dimension without disorder to
familiarize with it and also to search for a possible explanation of the Giant
Proximity Effect (GPE). After that we will investigate numerically the ground
state properties of the 2-dimensional lattice model, focusing our attention
especially on the stiffness and magnetization of the system in the xy plane. We
will show that disorder can induce superconductivity in a CDW phase. This
picture is really interesting because it could show how an insulating system
can produce a superconducting phase thank to the interplay with impurites.
