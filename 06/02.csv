rate in NaI crystals with the phase expected for WIMP scattering events. This
signal is dramatically inconsistent with upper limits from other experiments
for elastically scattering weak-scale WIMPs. However, the results are
compatible for the case of inelastic dark matter (iDM). The iDM theory, as
implemented by Tucker-Smith and Weiner, constrains the WIMP to a tight contour
in sigma_n-delta space, where delta is the mass difference between the ground
state and excited WIMPs. An urgent priority in direct detection is to test this
scenario. The crucial test of the iDM explanation of DAMA -- an ""experimentum
crucis"" -- is an experiment with directional sensitivity, which can measure the
daily modulation in direction. Because the contrast can be 100%, it is a
sharper test than the much smaller annual modulation in the rate. We estimate
the significance of such an experiment as a function of the WIMP mass, cross
section, background rate, and other parameters. The proposed experiment
severely constrains the DAMA/iDM scenario even with modest exposure (~1000 kg
day) on gaseous xenon.

even though they can show significant dynamic activity on short timescales. In
this paper the dynamics of non-axisymmetric hydrodynamical disturbances of
disks are investigated analytically building upon the steady state
three-dimensional structure and evolution of axisymmetric perturbations
explored in previous work. Assuming a polytropic equation of state solutions
are found by means of an asymptotic expansion in the small parameter measuring
the ratio of the disk thickness to characteristic radius. In-depth analysis
shows that every perturbation that disturbs the radial velocity induces
significant transient growth in the (acoustic) energy of the evolving
disturbance. This effect is most evident in the density and vertical velocity.
The transient growth observed is tied to the non-separable nature of the
solutions where, in particular, pattern evolution is controlled by a similarity
variable composed of the radial coordinate and time. This leads to growing
winding perturbations that display successive radial peaks and troughs. We
argue that these transient non-axisymmetric structures may precipitate
secondary instabilities which, consequently, may be a critical element for a
new alternative picture of turbulence arousal in non-magnetized astrophysical
disks.

freedom of 'entropyless' multicentered solutions consisting of anti-D0-branes
bound to a D6-anti-D6 pair. Second, we determine the number of free
supergravity excitations of the corresponding AdS_3 geometry with the same

different sets of states, the leading degeneracies in a large charge expansion
are equal to each other and that, furthermore, the number of such states is
parametrically smaller than that arising from the D4D0 black hole's entropy.
This strongly suggests that supergravity alone is not sufficient to capture all
degrees of freedom of large supersymmetric black holes. Comparing the free
supergravity calculation to that of the D6-anti-D6-D0 system we find that the
bound on the free spectrum imposed by the stringy exclusion principle (a
unitarity bound in the dual CFT) seems to be captured in the dynamics of the

  Transport studies under microwave photo-excitation exhibit radiation-induced
magneto-resistance oscillations in both the diagonal, $R_{xx}$, and

reason that the mechanism which is responsible for producing the non-monotonic

density around the shell is high enough to form new stars. We find two CO

of 3.4 km/s, implying that the shell's expansion age is ~1 Myr. This timescale
is in good agreement with numerical simulations of the expansion of the HII
region (Hosokawa et al. 2006). We conclude that the star formation on the

band X-ray spectrum of PDS 456. The Suzaku spectrum exhibits highly
statistically significant absorption features near 9 keV in the quasar

Fourier-domain gravitational waveforms produced by eccentric, inspiraling
compact binaries in a post-circular or small-eccentricity approximation. The
time-dependent, ""plus"" and ""cross"" polarizations are expanded in Bessel
functions, which are then self-consistently re-expanded in a power series about
zero initial eccentricity to eighth order. The stationary phase approximation
is then employed to obtain explicit analytic expressions for the Fourier
transform of the post-circular expanded, time-domain signal. We exemplify this
framework by considering Newtonian-accurate waveforms, which in the
post-circular scheme give rise to higher harmonics of the orbital phase and
amplitude corrections both to the amplitude and the phase of the Fourier domain
waveform. Such higher harmonics lead to an effective increase in the inspiral
mass reach of a detector as a function of the binary's eccentricity e_0 at the
time when the binary enters the detector sensitivity band. Using the largest
initial eccentricity allowed by our approximations (e_0 < 0.4), the mass reach
is found to be enhanced up to factors of approximately 5 relative to that of
circular binaries for Advanced LIGO, LISA, and the proposed Einstein Telescope
at a signal-to-noise ratio of ten. A post-Newtonian generalization of the post
circular scheme is also discussed, which holds the promise to provide
""ready-to-use"" Fourier-domain waveforms for data analysis of eccentric
inspirals.

assembly of icosahedral viral shells. Although the geometric structure of the
capsid (shell) is fairly well understood in terms of its constituent subunits,
the assembly process is not. For the purpose of this paper, the capsid is
modeled by a polyhedron whose facets represent the monomers. The assembly
process is modeled by a rooted tree, the leaves representing the facets of the
polyhedron, the root representing the assembled polyhedron, and the internal
vertices representing intermediate stages of assembly (subsets of facets).
Besides its virological motivation, the enumeration of orbits of trees under
the action of a finite group is of independent mathematical interest. If $G$ is
a finite group acting on a finite set $X$, then there is a natural induced
action of $G$ on the set $\mathcal{T}_X$ of trees whose leaves are bijectively
labeled by the elements of $X$. If $G$ acts simply on $X$, then $|X| := |X_n| =
n \cdot |G|$, where $n$ is the number of $G$-orbits in $X$. The basic
combinatorial results in this paper are (1) a formula for the number of orbits
of each size in the action of $G$ on $\mathcal{T}_{X_n}$, for every $n$, and
(2) a simple algorithm to find the stabilizer of a tree $\tau \in
\mathcal{T}_X$ in $G$ that runs in linear time and does not need memory in
addition to its input tree.

the question ""Why do the Cosmological Perturbations look Classical?"" and offers
an answer based on unitary quantum mechanics (i.e., without reference to the
projection postulate) relying on the decoherence type of analysis. The argument
is, thus, implicitly assuming that decoherence offers a satisfactory solution
to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics. We will review here, why do
we, together with various other researchers in the field, consider that this is
not the case, in general, and particularly not at all in the situation at hand.
In fact, as has been previously discussed (A. Perez, H. Sahlmann, and D.
Sudarsky, CQG 23, 2317, (2006);[arXiv: gr-qc/0508100]), we will argue that the
cosmological situation is one where the measurement problem of quantum

sharper conondrum, the one that should be addressed when dealing with the
inflationary account of the origin of the seeds of cosmic structure in the

and the case in which both variations are allowed, fitting also a set of
cosmological parameters. We find a fenomenological relationship between the
variation of $\alpha$ and the variation of $m_e$, between decoupling and
present time. We analyze the Barrow-Magueijo fenomenological model, which
propose a variation in the electron mass induced by changes in a space-time
scalar field. We present improved solutions and we estimate the model
parameters using bounds on the variation of the electron mass at different
cosmic times. On the other hand, from results of experiments that test the Weak
Equivalence Principle, we find a limit for the model's parameter, that comes
from the variation of the electron mass induced by spatial variations of the
scalar field. By comparing both limits, we arrive at the conclusion that the
model should be ruled-out. Lastly, we reanalyze the effects of the variation of
$\alpha$ or $m_e$ upon planetary radii. We explain why the variation of the
electron mass does not induce observable changes on the radii. We present a

$dN/dM\propto M^{-1.6}$. To understand this discrepancy we study the robustness
of the mass spectrum derived using the Clumpfind algorithm. Both 2D and 3D
Clumpfind versions are tested, using 850 $\mu$m dust emission and 13CO
spectral-line observations of Perseus, respectively. The effect of varying
threshold is not important, but varying stepsize produces a different effect
for 2D and 3D cases. In the 2D case, where emission is relatively isolated
(associated with only the densest peaks in the cloud), the mass spectrum
variability is negligible compared to the mass function fit uncertainties. In
the 3D case, however, where the 13CO emission traces the bulk of the molecular
cloud, the number of clumps and the derived mass spectrum are highly correlated
with the stepsize used. The distinction between ""2D"" and ""3D"" here is more
importantly also a distinction between ""sparse"" and ""crowded"" emission. In any
""crowded"" case, Clumpfind should not be used blindly to derive mass functions.
Clumpfind's output in the ""crowded"" case can still offer a statistical
description of emission useful in inter-comparisons, but the clump-list should
not be treated as a robust region decomposition suitable to generate a
physically-meaningful mass function. We conclude that the 13CO mass spectrum
depends on the observations resolution, due to the hierarchical structure of
MC.

gets smaller as $\alpha\rightarrow 1$ and vanishes for $\alpha=1$ when the
measure corresponds to the Entanglement of Formation (EoF). We show that the
R\'enyi measure aways satisfies the standard monogamy of entanglement for
$\alpha = 2$, and only violates a high order monogamy inequality, in the rare
cases in which the strong superadditivity is also violated. The sates
numerically found where the violation occurs have special symmetries where both
inequalities are equivalent. We also show that every measure satisfing monogamy
for high dimensional systems also satisfies the strong superadditivity
inequality. For the case of R\'enyi measure, we provide strong numerical
evidences that these two properties are equivalent.

topic of high-resolution observations and image restoration. It begins with a
theoretical reviewing of the problem that represents the atmospheric turbulence
and the instrumental aberrations on the image quality. This problem force us to
implement post-facto image restoration techniques that, added to the real-time
corrections performed by the Adaptive Optics, gives us images closer to
reality. To have good solar observations overcoming the negative influence of
the Earth' s atmosphere, one effort is being made with the development of the
Sunrise mission. This project consists in a balloon-borne mission that will
launch a 1-m telescope to the stratosphere and will record data with
unprecedented temporal, spatial and spectral resolution. The main aim of
Sunrise is to study the formation of magnetic structures in the solar
atmosphere and their interaction with the convective plasma flows. The on-board
instrument Imaging Magnetograph eXperiment (IMaX) will be able to produce
magnetic field maps of extensive solar regions by measuring the light
polarization in certain spectral lines. As a member of the IMaX team, I have
developed an in-flight calibration method to characterize the aberrations
affecting the images in IMaX. The second part of the thesis is centered on the
study of horizontal flows in solar active regions. Data from ground-based and
space observations are used as well as reconstruction techniques to restore the
images. We focus on the proper motions of structures in and around solar active
regions. The way to quantify the horizontal flows in the field-of-view consist
of using local correlation tracking techniques that generate flow maps.

brightest dSph galaxies. For Fornax we obtain a model-independent constraint on
the maximum-circular velocity, Vmax=18_{-3}^{+5} km/s. Although we obtain only
lower-limits of Vmax > 10 km/s for the remaining dSphs, we find that in all
cases the enclosed mass at the projected half-light radius is well constrained
and robust to a wide range of halo models and velocity anisotropies. We derive
a simple analytic formula that estimates M(rhalf) accurately with respect to
results from the full Jeans analysis. Applying this formula to the entire
population of Local Group dSphs, we demonstrate a correlation such that
M(rhalf)\propto rhalf^{1.4\pm 0.4}, or in terms of the mean density interior to
the half-light radius, <rho> \propto rhalf^{-1.6\pm 0.4}. This relation is
driven by the fact that the dSph data exhibit a correlation between global
velocity dispersion and half-light radius. We argue that tidal forces are
unlikely to have introduced this relation, but tides may have increased the
scatter and/or altered the slope. While the data are well described by mass
profiles ranging over a factor of < 2 in normalization (Vmax ~ 10-20 km/s), we
consider the hypothesis that all dSphs are embedded within a ""universal"" dark
matter halo. We show that in addition to the power law M\propto r^{1.4}, viable
candidates include a cuspy ""NFW"" halo with Vmax ~ 15 km/s and scale radius r_0
~ 800 pc, as well as a cored halo with Vmax ~ 13 km/s and r_0 ~ 150 pc.
Finally, assuming that their measured velocity dispersions accurately reflect
their masses, the smallest dSphs now allow us to resolve dSph densities at
radii as small as a few tens of pc. At these small scales we find mean
densities as large as <\rho> ~ 5 Msun/pc^3 (200 GeV/cm^3).

accretion to black holes is thought to be due to (1) a small-scale turbulent
magnetic field in the disk (due to the magneto-rotational instability or MRI)
which gives a large viscosity enhancing accretion, and (2) a large-scale
magnetic field which gives rise to matter outflows and/or electromagnetic jets
from the disk which also enhances accretion. An important problem with this
picture is that the enhanced viscosity is accompanied by an enhanced magnetic
diffusivity which acts to prevent the build up of a significant large-scale
field. Recent work has pointed out that the disk's surface layers are
non-turbulent and thus highly conducting (or non-diffusive) because the MRI is
suppressed high in the disk where the magnetic and radiation pressures are
larger than the thermal pressure. Here, we calculate the vertical ($z$)
profiles of the stationary accretion flows (with radial and azimuthal
components), and the profiles of the large-scale, magnetic field taking into
account the turbulent viscosity and diffusivity due to the MRI and the fact
that the turbulence vanishes at the surface of the disk. The stationary
solutions we find indicate that a weak ($\beta > 1$) large-scale field does not
diffuse away as suggested by earlier work.

how these objects formed, and surface photometry at optical and near-infrared
wavelengths represents a powerful tool for studying such structures. Here, we
identify a hitherto unrecognized problem with this technique, related to how
the night sky flux is typically measured and subtracted from astronomical
images. While most of the sky flux comes from regions between the observer and
the target object, a small fraction - the extragalactic background light (EBL)
- comes from behind. We argue that since this part of the sky flux can be
subject to extinction by dust present in the galaxy/group/cluster studied,
standard reduction procedures may lead to a systematic oversubtraction of the
EBL. Even very small amounts of extinction can lead to spurious features in
radial surface surface brightness profiles and colour maps of extended objects.
We assess the likely impact of this effect on a number of topics in
extragalactic astronomy where very deep surface photometry is currently
attempted, including studies of stellar halos, starburst host galaxies, disc
truncations and diffuse intragroup/intracluster light. We argue that EBL
extinction may provide at least a partial explanation for the anomalously red
colours reported for the halos of disc galaxies and the hosts of local
starburst galaxies. EBL extinction effects also mimic truncations in discs with
unusually high dust opacities, but are unlikely to be the cause of such
features in general. Failure to account for EBL extinction can also give rise
to a non-negligible underestimate of intragroup and intracluster light at the
faintest surface brightness levels currently probed. (Abridged)

investment of telescope time it is essential to identify the``optimal

the optimal redshift is determined by a combination of instrument dependent
factors and the evolution of the neutral fraction x_HI. We find that the
redshift range 8.1 +/- 1.1 and 9.8 +/- 1 are optimum for detecting ionized

  (i) At 1.6micron we find an extension N-E of the quasar nucleus that is

places HE0450-2958 directly onto the M_BH-M_bulge-relation for nearby galaxies.
(ii) HE0450-2958 is consistent with lying at the high-luminosity end of
Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 Galaxies, and more exotic explanations like a ""naked
quasar"" are unlikely. (iii) All 11.3micron radiation in the system is emitted
by the quasar nucleus, which is radiating at super-Eddington rate,
L/L_Edd=6.2+3.8-1.8, or 12 M_sun/yr. (iv) The companion galaxy is covered in
optically thick dust and is not a collisional ring galaxy. It emits in the far
infrared at ULIRG strength, powered by Arp220-like star formation (strong
starburst-like). An M82-like SED is ruled out. (v) With its black hole
accretion rate HE0450-2958 produces not enough new stars to maintain its
position on the M_BH-M_bulge-relation, and star formation and black hole
accretion are spatially disjoint; the bulge has to grow by redistribution of
preexisting stars. (vi) Systems similar to HE0450-2958 with spatially disjoint

neutrino telescope (with 80 strings) to probe the parameter space of the

Adopting conservative assumptions about the galactic halo model and the
expected experiment performance, we find that IceCube has a probability between
2% and 12% of achieving a 5sigma detection of dark matter annihilation in the
Sun, depending on the choice of priors for the scalar and gaugino masses and on
the astrophysical assumptions. We identify the most important annihilation
channels in the CMSSM parameter space favoured by current constraints, and we
demonstrate that assuming that the signal is dominated by a single annihilation
channel canlead to large systematic errors in the inferred WIMP annihilation
cross section. We demonstrate that ~ 66% of the CMSSM parameter space violates
the equilibrium condition between capture and annihilation in the center of the
Sun. By cross-correlating our predictions with direct detection methods, we
conclude that if IceCube does detect a neutrino flux from the Sun at high
significance while direct detection experiments do not find a signal above a
spin-independent cross section sigma_SI^p larger than 5x10^{-9} pb, the CMSSM
will be strongly disfavoured, given standard astrophysical assumptions for the
WIMP distribution. This result is robust with respect to a change of priors. We
argue that the proposed low-energy DeepCore extension of IceCube will be an
ideal instrument to focus on relevant CMSSM areas of parameter space.

we find that the simulated clusters are close to a perfect virial state and do
indeed define a Fundamental Plane. The fitted parameters of the FJ, Kormendy
and FP relationships do not show any significant dependence on $\Omega_m$
and/or $\Omega_{\Lambda}$. The one outstanding effect is the influence of
$\Omega_{m}$ on the thickness of the Fundamental Plane. Following the time
evolution of our models, we find slight changes of FJ and Kormendy parameters
in high $\Omega_m$ universe, along with a slight decrease of FP fitting
parameters. We also see an initial increase of the FP thickness followed by a
convergence to a nearly constant value. The epoch of convergence is later for
higher values of $\Omega_m$ while the thickness remains constant in the low
$\Omega_m$ $\Lambda$-models. We also find a continuous increase of the FP
thickness in the Standard CDM (SCDM) cosmology. There is no evidence that these
differences are due to the different power spectrum slope at cluster scales.
From the point of view of the FP, there is little difference between clusters
that quietly accreted their mass and those that underwent massive mergers. The
principal effect of strong mergers is to change significantly the ratio of the
half-mass radius $r_{half}$ to the harmonic mean radius $r_h$.

mass of the binaries with respect to the MBH, as well as their internal
semi-major axis a, using a Monte Carlo method. For a system like the Galactic
center, the main conclusions are the following: (1) The binary fraction can be
of the order of a few percent outside 0.1 pc, but decreases quickly closer to
the MBH. (2) Within ~0.1 pc, binaries can only exist on eccentric orbits with
apocenters much further away from the MBH. (3) Far away from the MBH, loss-cone
effects are the dominant mechanism that disrupts binaries with internal
velocities close to the velocity dispersion. Closer to the MBH, three-body
encounters are more effective in disrupting binaries. (4) The rate at which
hard binaries become tighter is usually less than the rate at which a binary
diffuses to orbits that are more bound to the MBH. (5) Binaries are typically
disrupted before they experience an exchange interaction; as a result, the
number of exchanges is less than one would estimate from a simple ""nv\sigma
estimate''. We give applications of our results to the formation of X-ray
binaries near MBHs and to the production rates of hyper-velocity stars by
intermediate mass MBHs.

describing the generating function of the major index over the set of all
permutations of [n]={1,...,n} which are shuffles of given disjoint ordered
sequences whose union is [n]. Two special cases are singled out: If the single
element j is inserted into any permutation P of the remaining elements of [n],
then the theorem states that inserting j into P increases the major index of P
by some element of {0,1,...,n-1}, the increase determined uniquely by the index
of insertion. We provide a direct proof of this fact using an algorithm which
calculates the increase at each index; this in turn leads to a bijective proof
of MacMahon's 1916 result on the equidistribution of major index and inversion
number over S_n. Using this special case we prove the general case of the
theorem by establishing a bijection between shuffles of ordered sequences and a
certain set of partitions. In the second special case of interest, Garsia and
Gessel's theorem provides a proof of the equidistribution of major index and
inversion number over inverse descent classes, a result first proved
bijectively by Foata and Schutzenberger in 1978. We provide, based on the

Using this model, and both numerical and analytical approaches, we studied the

observed in the model and in experiment is the key determinant of thermal
response for viruses and bacteria. Our results explain most of the earlier

absence of evolutionary trade-off which was expected but not found in
experiments, correlation between denaturation temperature for several protein
families and the Optimal Growth Temperature (OGT) of their host organisms, and
proximity of bacterial or viral OGTs to their evolutionary temperatures. Our
theory quantitatively and with high accuracy described thermal response curves

treat the ensemble as a single effective spin. We are able to initialize the
qubits in a simple state and perform a projective measurement on the system. We
demonstrate full control of the qubit Bloch vector, performing arbitrary
high-fidelity rotations ($\tau_{\pi}\sim$200 $\mu$s). Randomized Benchmarking
demonstrates an error per gate (a Pauli-randomized $\pi/2$ and $\pi$ pulse
pair) of $8\pm1\times10^{-4}$. Ramsey interferometry and spin-locking
measurements are used to elucidate the limits of qubit coherence in the system,
yielding a typical free-induction decay coherence time of $T_{2}\sim$2 ms, and
a limiting $T_{1\rho}\sim$688 ms. These experimental specifications make ion
crystals in a Penning trap ideal candidates for novel experiments in quantum
control. As such, we briefly describe recent efforts aimed at studying the
error-suppressing capabilities of dynamical decoupling pulse sequences,
demonstrating an ability to extend qubit coherence and suppress phase errors.
We conclude with a discussion of future avenues for experimental exploration,

from the distances between 20-70 astronomical units from the Sun has
consistently indicated the presence of a small, anomalous, blue-shifted Doppler
frequency drift that limited the accuracy of the orbit reconstruction for these
vehicles. This drift was interpreted as a sunward acceleration of a_P =
(8.74+/-1.33)x10^{-10} m/s^2 for each particular spacecraft. This signal has
become known as the Pioneer anomaly; the nature of this anomaly is still being
investigated.
  Recently new Pioneer 10 and 11 radio-metric Doppler and flight telemetry data
became available. The newly available Doppler data set is much larger when
compared to the data used in previous investigations and is the primary source
for new investigation of the anomaly. In addition, the flight telemetry files,
original project documentation, and newly developed software tools are now used
to reconstruct the engineering history of spacecraft. With the help of this
information, a thermal model of the Pioneers was developed to study possible
contribution of thermal recoil force acting on the spacecraft. The goal of the
ongoing efforts is to evaluate the effect of on-board systems on the
spacecrafts' trajectories and possibly identify the nature of this anomaly.
  Techniques developed for the investigation of the Pioneer anomaly are
applicable to the New Horizons mission. Analysis shows that anisotropic thermal
radiation from on-board sources will accelerate this spacecraft by ~41 x
10^{-10} m/s^2. We discuss the lessons learned from the study of the Pioneer
anomaly for the New Horizons spacecraft.

well satisfies the Korringa relation for a Fermi liquid. Thus, CoO2 is not
simply located at the limit of x->0 for AxCoO2 (A = Li, Na) compounds. The
disappearance of the electron correlations in CoO2 is due to the three

increasing the doping content of Rh, Ir and Pd, the antiferromagnetic state of

induce the superconductivity, varies from one kind of doped element to another.
Regarding the close values of the maximum superconducting transition

the determination of its asymptotic competitive ratio has attracted great

3.25, 3.0625, 2.8596, 2.7834 to 2.66013. In this paper, we rewrite the upper
bound record to 2.5545. Our idea for the improvement is as follows. In SODA
2002 \cite{SS03}, Seiden and van Stee proposed an elegant algorithm called $H
\otimes B$, comprised of the {\em Harmonic algorithm} $H$ and the {\em Improved
Harmonic algorithm} $B$, for the two-dimensional online bin packing problem and
proved that the algorithm has an asymptotic competitive ratio of at most
2.66013. Since the best known online algorithm for one-dimensional bin packing
is the {\em Super Harmonic algorithm} \cite{S02}, a natural question to ask is:
could a better upper bound be achieved by using the Super Harmonic algorithm
instead of the Improved Harmonic algorithm? However, as mentioned in
\cite{SS03}, the previous analysis framework does not work. In this paper, we
give a positive answer for the above question. A new upper bound of 2.5545 is
obtained for 2-dimensional online bin packing. The main idea is to develop new
weighting functions for the Super Harmonic algorithm and propose new techniques
to bound the total weight in a rectangular bin.

equivalency between a continuous functional deconvolution model and its
real-life discrete counterpart over a wide range of Besov balls and for the
$L^2$-risk. For this purpose, all possible models are divided into three
groups. For the models in the first group, which we call uniform, the
convergence rates in the discrete and the continuous models coincide no matter
what the sampling scheme is chosen, and hence the replacement of the discrete
model by its continuous counterpart is legitimate. For the models in the second
group, to which we refer as regular, one can point out the best sampling
strategy in the discrete model, but not every sampling scheme leads to the same
convergence rates; there are at least two sampling schemes which deliver
different convergence rates in the discrete model (i.e., at least one of the
discrete models leads to convergence rates that are different from the
convergence rates in the continuous model). The third group consists of models
for which, in general, it is impossible to devise the best sampling strategy;
we call these models irregular. We formulate the conditions when each of these
situations takes place. In the regular case, we not only point out the number
and the selection of sampling points which deliver the fastest convergence
rates in the discrete model but also investigate when, in the case of an
arbitrary sampling scheme, the convergence rates in the continuous model
coincide or do not coincide with the convergence rates in the discrete model.
We also study what happens if one chooses a uniform, or a more general
pseudo-uniform, sampling scheme which can be viewed as an intuitive replacement
of the continuous model.

polar cap or the outer gap model. The purpose of this work is to study the
pulsed component, that is the light-curves as well as the spectra of the
high-energy emission, above 10 MeV, emanating from the striped wind model.
Gamma rays are produced by scattering off the soft cosmic microwave background
photons on the ultrarelativistic leptons flowing in the current sheets. We
compute the time-dependent inverse Compton emissivity of the wind, in the
Thomson regime, by performing three-dimensional numerical integration in space
over the whole striped wind. The phase-dependent spectral variability is then
calculated as well as the change in pulse shape when going from the lowest to
the highest energies. Several light curves and spectra of inverse Compton
radiation with phase resolved dependence are presented. We apply our model to
the well-known gamma-ray pulsar Geminga. We are able to fit the EGRET spectra
between 10 MeV and 10 GeV as well as the light curve above 100 MeV with good
accuracy.

perturbations: individuals are given the opportunity to change their opinion,

opinion space. We derive the master equation of this process. One of the main
effects of noise is to induce an order-disorder transition. In the disordered
state the opinion distribution tends to be uniform, while for the ordered state
a set of well defined opinion groups are formed, although with some opinion
spread inside them. Using a linear stability analysis we can derive approximate

Ratran to predict water line profiles and intensity maps. The model shows three
spatially distinct regions in the disk where water concentrations are high,
related to different chemical pathways to form the water: (1) a big water
reservoir in the deep midplane behind the inner rim, (2) a belt of cold water
around the distant icy midplane beyond the snow-line r>20AU, and (3) a layer of
irradiated hot water at high altitudes z/r=0.1...0.3, extending from about 1AU
to 30AU, where the kinetic gas temperature ranges from 200K to 1500K. Although
region 3 contains only little amounts of water vapour (~3x10^-5 M_Earth), we
find this warm layer to be almost entirely responsible for the rotational water
emission lines, execpt for the 3 lowest excitation lines. Thus, Herschel will
probe first and foremost the conditions and radial extension of region 3, where
water is predominantly formed via neutral-neutral reactions and the gas is
thermally decoupled from the dust T_gas>T_dust. The observations do not allow
for a determination of the snow-line, because the snow-line truncates the
radial extension of region 1, whereas the lines originate from region 3.
Different line transfer approximations (LTE, escape probability, Monte Carlo)

for the DM and two simple relations which have recently emerged from numerical

relation between the DM velocity anisotropy profile and its density slope. For
DM distributions described by the NFW or the Sersic profiles, the resulting gas
density profile, the gas-to-total-mass ratio profile, and the entropy profile
are all in good agreement with X-ray observations. All these profiles are
derived using zero free parameters. Our result allows us to predict the X-ray

Numerical studies
of large-scale structure simulations cannot resolve the whole process and their
approach usually assumes that only gas denser than a typical threshold can host
and form stars. We investigate the onset of cosmological star formation and
compare several very-high-resolution, three-dimensional, N-body/SPH simulations
that include non-equilibrium, atomic and molecular chemistry, star formation
prescriptions, and feedback effects. We study how primordial star formation
depends on gas density thresholds, cosmological parameters and initial set-ups.
For mean-density initial conditions, we find that standard low-density
star-formation threshold (0.2 h^2/cm3) models predict the onset of star
formation at z~25-31, depending on the adopted cosmology. In these models stars
are formed regardless of the time between the moment when the threshold is
reached and the effective runaway collapse. At high redshift, this time
interval represents a significant fraction of the Hubble time and thus this
assumption can induce large artificial off-sets to the onset of star formation.
Choosing higher density thresholds (135 h^2/cm3) allows the entire cooling
process to be followed, and the onset of star formation is then estimated to be
at redshift z~12-16. When isolated, rare, high-density peaks are considered,
the chemical evolution is much faster and the first star formation episodes
occur at z > 40, almost regardless of the choice for the density threshold.
These results could have implications for the formation redshift of the first
cosmological objects, as inferred from direct numerical simulations of
mean-density environments, and on the studies of the reionization history of
the universe.

apposing membranes. A central question is how to characterize the binding
affinity of these membrane-anchored molecules. For soluble molecules, the
binding affinity is typically quantified by the binding equilibrium constant
K3D in the linear relation [RL] = K3D [R][L] between the volume concentration
[RL] of bound complexes and the volume concentrations [R] and [L] of unbound
molecules. For membrane-anchored molecules, it is often assumed by analogy that
the area concentration of bound complexes [RL] is proportional to the product
[R][L] of the area concentrations for the unbound receptor and ligand
molecules. We show here (i) that this analogy is only valid for two planar
membranes immobilized on rigid surfaces, and (ii) that the thermal roughness of
flexible membranes leads to cooperative binding of receptors and ligands. In
the case of flexible membranes, the area concentration [RL] of receptor-ligand
bonds is proportional to the square of [R][L] for typical lengths and
concentrations of receptors and ligands in cell adhesion zones. The cooperative

decoherence. Empty space is filled with vacuum energy due to matter fields in

should represent a universal source of decoherence. To study this problem we
employ a stochastic approach that models spacetime fluctuations close to the
Planck scale by means of a classical, randomly fluctuating metric (random
gravity framework). We enrich the classical scheme for metric perturbations
over a curved background by also including matter fields and metric conformal
fluctuations. We show in general that a conformally modulated metric induces
dephasing as a result of an effective nonlinear newtonian potential obtained in
the appropriate nonrelativistic limit of a minimally coupled Klein-Gordon
field. The special case of vacuum fluctuations is considered and a quantitative
estimate of the expected effect deduced. Secondly we address the question of
how conformal fluctuations could physically arise. By applying the random
gravity framework we first show that standard GR seems to forbid spontaneous
conformal metric modulations. Finally we argue that a different result follows
within scalar-tensor theories of gravity such as e.g. Brans-Dicke theory. In
this case a conformal modulation of the metric arises naturally as a result of
the fluctuations in the Brans-Dicke field and quantum dephasing of a test
particle is expected to occur. For large negative values of the coupling
parameter the conformal fluctuations may also contribute to alleviate the well
known problem of the large zero point energy due to quantum matter fields.

towards a stationary temperature profile, which is discussed for several

a uniform distribution of sizes, the stationary temperature profile is
nonuniform with either hot small particles (constant force driving) or hot
large particles (constant velocity or constant energy driving). Polydispersity

controversial claims, incorrect structural conclusions or CFP systematics, and

the energy as a function of the condensate parameter is again unbounded from

the two particle propagator in the quark anti-quark channel in zero order in

Element method involves the modeling of two or more bodies that meet through an
interface. The interface can be physical, as in multi-physics and contact
problems, or purely numerical, as in the coupling of non-conforming meshes. The
most critical part of the modeling process is to ensure geometric compatibility
and a complete transfer of surface tractions between the different components
at the connecting interfaces. Popular contact modeling techniques rely on
geometric projections to detect and resolve overlapping or mass
interpenetration between two or more contacting bodies. Such approaches have
been shown to have two major drawbacks: they are not suitable for contact at
highly nonlinear surfaces and sharp corners where smooth normal projections are
not feasible, and they fail to guarantee a complete and accurate transfer of
pressure across the interface. This dissertation presents a novel formulation
for the modeling of contact problems that possesses the ability to resolve
complicated contact scenarios effectively, while being simpler to implement and
more widely applicable than currently available methods. We show that the
formulation boils down to a node-to-surface gap function that works effectively
for non-smooth contact. The numerical implementation using the midpoint rule
shows the need to guarantee the conservation of the total energy during impact,
for which a Lagrange multiplier method is used. We propose a local enrichment
of the interface and a simple stabilization procedure based on the
discontinuous Galerkin method to guarantee an accurate transfer of the pressure
field. The result is a robust interface formulation for contact problems and
the coupling of non-conforming meshes.

spectrum and non-linear propagator. The resultant integral expressions keep
important non-perturbative properties which can dramatically improve the
prediction of non-linear power spectrum. Employing the Born approximation, we
then derive the analytic expressions for non-linear power spectrum and the

improved PT results and N-body simulations shows that a percent-level agreement
is achieved in a certain range in power spectrum and in a rather wider range in
correlation function. Combining a model of non-linear redshift-space
distortion, we also evaluate the power spectrum and correlation function in
correlation function. In contrast to the results in real space, the agreement
between N-body simulations and improved PT predictions tends to be worse, and a
more elaborate modeling for redshift-space distortion needs to be developed.

spectra of the HI Lyalpha forest. We begin our analysis investigating the
intrinsic biases thought to arise in the widely adopted standard technique of
combining multiple lines of sight when searching for the proximity effect. We
confirm the existence of this biases. We then concentrate on the analysis of
the proximity effect along individual lines of sight. We construct the
proximity effect strength distribution (PESD) and confirm that the PESD
inferred from a simple averaging technique accurately recovers the input
strength of the proximity effect at all redshifts. Moreover, the PESD closely
follows the behaviors found in observed samples of quasar spectra. However, the
PESD obtained from our new simulated sight lines presents some differences to
that of simple Monte Carlo simulations. After developing three new theoretical
methods of recovering the strength of the proximity effect on individual lines
of sight, we compare their accuracy to the PESD from the simple averaging

including multiple beam dynamics effects. The essential features of the
simulation include a fully 3D strong-strong beam-beam particle-in-cell Poisson
solver, interactions among multiple bunches and both head-on and long-range
beam-beam collisions, coupled linear optics and helical trajectory consistent
with beam orbit measurements, chromaticity and resistive wall impedance. We
validate individual physical processes against measured data where possible,
and analytic calculations elsewhere. Finally, we present simulations of the
effects of increasing beam intensity with single and multiple bunches, and
study the combined effect of long-range beam-beam interactions and transverse
impedance. The results of the simulations were successfully used in Tevatron
operations to support a change of chromaticity during the transition to
collider mode optics, leading to a factor of two decrease in proton losses, and
thus improved reliability of collider operations.

  random dynamical systems",,"Il Nuovo Cimento, B, 114, N. 4, 373- 382 (1999)",,,"math-ph math.MP quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a model based on random dynamical systems (RDS) in information
spaces (realized as rings of $p$-adic integers) which supports Buonomano's
non-ergodic interpretation of quantum mechanics. In this model the memory
system of an equipment works as a dynamical system perturbed by noise.
Interference patterns correspond to attractors of RDS. There exists a large
class of $p$-adic RDS for which interference patterns cannot be disturbed by
noise. Therefore, if the equipment is described by such a RDS then the result
of statistical experiment does not depend on noise in the equipment. On the one
hand, we support the corpuscular model, because a quantum particle can be
described as a corpuscular object. On the other hand, our model does not differ
strongly from the wave model, because a quantum particle interacts with the
whole equipment. Hence the interaction has nonlocal character. For example, in
the two slit experiment a quantum particle interacts with both slits (but it
passes only one of them).

Brightwell
and Trotter proved that the dimension of the vertex-edge-face poset $\Pvef{M}$
of a planar map $M$ is at most four. In this paper we investigate cases where
$\dim(\Pvef{M}) \leq 3$ and also where $\dim(\Qvf{M}) \leq 3$; here $\Qvf{M}$
denotes the vertex-face poset of $M$. We show: - If $M$ contains a
$K_4$-subdivision, then $\dim(\Pvef{M}) = \dim(\Qvf{M}) = 4$. - If $M$ or the
dual $M^*$ contains a $K_{2,3}$-subdivision, then $\dim(\Pvef{M}) = 4$. Hence,
a map $M$ with $\dim(\Pvef{M}) \leq 3$ must be outerplanar and have an
outerplanar dual. We concentrate on the simplest class of such maps and prove
that within this class $\dim(\Pvef{M}) \leq 3$ is equivalent to the existence
of a certain oriented coloring of edges. This condition is easily checked and
can be turned into a linear time algorithm returning a 3-realizer.
Additionally, we prove that if $M$ is 2-connected and $M$ and $M^*$ are
outerplanar, then $\dim(\Qvf{M}) \leq 3$. There are, however, outerplanar maps
with $\dim(\Qvf{M}) = 4$. We construct the first such example.

\pi^+\pi^-e^\pm\nu$ allows to obtain the value of the isospin and angular
momentum zero pion-pion scattering length $a_0^0$. To extract this quantity
from experimental data the radiative corrections (RC) have to be taken into
account. Basing on the lowest order results and the factorization hypothesis,
we get the expressions for RC in the leading and next-to leading logarithmical
approximation. It is shown that the decay width dependence on the lepton mass
$m_e$ through the parameter
$\sigma=\frac{\alpha}{2\pi}\br{\ln\frac{M^2}{m_e^2}-1}$ has a standard form of
the Drell-Yan process and is proportional to the Sommerfeld-Sakharov factor.
The numerical estimations are presented.

The orbital angular momentum carried by light is transferred to plasma

fluid is the cause of helical current which produce the kilogauss axial
