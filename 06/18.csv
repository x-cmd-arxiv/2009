three-dimensional gauge theories with N=3 supersymmetry. This class of models
includes ABJM theory, the proposed gauge theory dual of M-theory on AdS_4 x
S^7/Z_k, as a special case. In the UV limit of the N=3 theories the Yang-Mills
coupling becomes weak and the monopole operators are described by classical
backgrounds. This allows us to find their SU(2)_R charges in a one-loop
computation which by virtue of the non-renormalization of non-abelian R-charges
yields the exact result for any value of the coupling. The spectrum of SU(2)_R
charges is found by quantizing the SU(2)/U(1) collective coordinate of the BPS
background, whose dynamics is that of a charged particle on a sphere with a
Wess-Zumino term representing a magnetic monopole at its center. If the
Wess-Zumino coefficient is h, then the smallest possible SU(2)_R representation
for BPS monopole operators has spin |h|/2. We find, in agreement with earlier
proposals, that h is proportional to the sum of the U(1)_R charges of all the
fermion fields weighted by the effective monopole charges determined by their
gauge representations. The field content of ABJM theory is such that h=0. This
proves for any Chern-Simons level k the existence of monopole operators which
are singlets under all global symmetries and have vanishing scaling dimensions.
These operators are essential for matching the spectrum of the ABJM theory with
supergravity and for the supersymmetry enhancement to N=8.

large, and typically dominates over the standard h -> b b decay. The dominant

new mode is that it satisfies an equation of motion that is of first order in
time derivatives. At linear level the mode is manifest only around spatially
inhomogeneous and time-dependent backgrounds. We find two serious problems

instabilities at short distances. Second, it becomes strongly coupled at an
extremely low cutoff scale. We also discuss the ""projectable"" version of
Horava's proposal and argue that this version can be understood as a certain
limit of the ghost condensate model. The theory is still problematic since the
additional field generically forms caustics and, again, has a very low strong

little and is nearly independent of all other physical properties of the

whether the observed small scatter is compatible with the assumption of

statistical analysis of the results of cluster simulation. The underlying
interaction process is merging (and also destruction) of smaller galaxies
forming the giant galaxy. The cluster itself is supposed to be in virial
equilibrium.
  We find that the evolutionary importance of merger processes grows with
decreasing scale. Rich clusters as well as their brightest members evolve
merely slowly whereas compact groups as well as their brightest members evolve
more rapidly and more violently. We also find that the number of merger
processes leading to the growth of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) is small
enough to keep the BCG mass dispersion below the measured value. Our
simulations substantiate that just the combination of the initial distribution
function and the following merging to form the BCG can explain the remarkably

a postulated prior distribution. It is shown that with random linear

the subsequent acceleration by the motional electric field ${\bf E} = - (1/c)

proportional with respect to protons, because the heavy ion orbit is mostly

not form a black hole. Instead, after reaching some minimal radius, the shell
bounces back. The Schrodinger canonical formalism is used to quantize the
motion of the charged shell. The limits near the horizon and near the

toward other neurons' dendrites, the effect on each of those neurons is
mediated by the weight of the synapse that separates it from the firing neuron.
This weight, in turn, is affected by the postsynaptic neuron's response through
a mechanism that is thought to underlie important processes such as learning
and memory. Although of difficult quantification, cortical synaptic weights
have been found to obey a long-tailed unimodal distribution peaking near the
lowest values, thus confirming some of the predictive models built previously.
These models are all causally local, in the sense that they refer to the
situation in which a number of neurons all fire directly at the same
postsynaptic neuron. Consequently, they necessarily embody assumptions
regarding the generation of action potentials by the presynaptic neurons that
have little biological interpretability. In this letter we introduce a network
model of large groups of interconnected neurons and demonstrate, making none of
the assumptions that characterize the causally local models, that its long-term
behavior gives rise to a distribution of synaptic weights with the same
properties that were experimentally observed. In our model the action
potentials that create a neuron's input are, ultimately, the product of
network-wide causal chains relating what happens at a neuron to the firings of
others. Our model is then of a causally global nature and predicates the
emergence of the synaptic-weight distribution on network structure and
function. As such, it has the potential to become instrumental also in the
study of other emergent cortical phenomena.

phenomenological pion exchange with a physical lower limit in b (the transverse

picture of the ""pion cloud"" model of the nucleon's sea quark distributions,
while restricting its application to the region actually governed by chiral

~1/3 of the measured antiquark flavor asymmetry dbar - ubar at x ~ 0.1; (b) the
strange sea quarks, s and sbar, are significantly more localized than the light

its gluonic size, <b^2>_{q + qbar} > <b^2>_g, as suggested by the t-slopes of

sightlines toward GRBs using a sample of 10 GRB afterglow spectra obtained with
VLT-UVES over the past six years. The S/N ratio is sufficiently high that we
can extend previous studies to smaller equivalent widths (typically Wr>0.3A).
Over a pathlength of Delta(z)~14 the number of weak absorbers detected is
similar along GRB and QSO lines of sight, while the number of strong systems is
larger along GRB lines of sight with a 2-sigma significance. Using intermediate
and low resolution observations reported in the literature, we increase the
absorption length for strong systems to Delta(z)=31.5 (about twice the path
length of previous studies) and find that the number density of strong MgII
systems is a factor of 2.1+/-0.6 higher (about 3-sigma significance) toward
GRBs as compared to QSOs, about twice smaller however than previously reported.
We divide the sample in three redshift bins and we find that the number density
of strong MgII is larger in the low redshift bins. We investigate in detail the
properties of strong MgII systems observed with UVES. Both the estimated dust
extinction in strong GRB MgII systems and the equivalent width distribution are
consistent with what is observed for standard QSO systems. We find also that
the number density of (sub)-DLAs per unit redshift in the UVES sample is
probably twice larger than what is expected from QSO sightlines which confirms
the peculiarity of GRB lines of sight. These results indicate that neither a
dust extinction bias nor different beam sizes of the sources are viable
explanations for the excess. It is still possible that the current sample of
GRB lines of sight is biased by a subtle gravitational lensing effect. More
data and larger samples are needed to test this hypothesis. (abridged)

thereby introducing a small parameter $\epsilon$. The boundary dilaton has a
profile which asymptotes to a constant in the far past and future and attains a
minimum value at intermediate times. We construct the sugra solution to first
non-trivial order in $\epsilon$, and find that it is smooth, horizon free, and
asymptotically $AdS_5\times S^5$ in the far future. When the intermediate
values of the dilaton becomes small enough the curvature becomes of order the
string scale and the sugra approximation breaks down. The resulting dynamics is
analysed in the dual SU(N) gauge theory on $S^3$ with a time dependent coupling
constant which varies slowly. When $N \epsilon \ll 1$, we find that a quantum
adiabatic approximation is applicable, and use it to argue that at late times
the geometry becomes smooth $AdS_5\times S^5$ again. When $N \epsilon \gg 1$,
we formulate a classical adiabatic perturbation theory based on coherent states
which arises in the large $N$ limit. For large values of the 'tHooft coupling
this reproduces the supergravity results. For small 'tHooft coupling the
coherent state calculations become involved and we cannot reach a definite
conclusion. We argue that the final state should have a dual description which
is mostly smooth $AdS_5$ space with the possible presence of a small black
hole.

feature of this model is that in the interior brane there exist only spin-zero
fundamental fields (scalar fields), while in the exterior one there exist only
spin-one fundamental interactions. As usual, the bulk of the universe is
dominated by gravitational interactions. In this model, like in the Ekpyrotic

existence of the particles predicted by the standard model in the exterior
brane (our universe). The scalar fields on the interior brane interact with the
spin-one fields on the exterior one only through gravitation, they induce the
effect of Scalar Field Dark Matter with an ultra-light mass on the exterior

tension are compared, with the aim to obtain the observed dynamics of the

bounds for fault-tolerant computation in heterogeneous circuits using the
maximum error computed for each circuit. We model the error estimation problem
as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate, over the joint error probability
function of the entire circuit, calculated efficiently through an intelligent
search of the entire input space using probabilistic traversal of a binary join
tree using Shenoy-Shafer algorithm. We demonstrate this model using MCNC and
ISCAS benchmark circuits and validate it using an equivalent HSpice model. Both
results yield the same worst-case input vectors and the highest % difference of
our error model over HSpice is just 1.23%. We observe that the maximum error
probabilities are significantly larger than the average error probabilities,
and provides a much tighter error bounds for fault-tolerant computation. We
also find that the error estimates depend on the specific circuit structure and
the maximum error probabilities are sensitive to the individual gate failure
probabilities.

astrophysics. Recent work has found a relation between radio luminosity, X-ray
luminosity, and black hole mass. With the assumption that radio and X-ray
luminosity are suitable proxies for jet power and accretion power,
respectively, a broad fundamental connection between accretion and jet
production is implied. In an effort to refine these links and enhance their
power, we have explored the above relations exclusively among black holes with
direct, dynamical mass-measurements. This approach not only eliminates
systematic errors incurred through the use of secondary mass measurements, but
also effectively restricts the range of distances considered to a
volume-limited sample. Further, we have exclusively used archival data from the
Chandra X-ray Observatory to best isolate nuclear sources. We find log(L_R) =
(4.80 +/- 0.24) + (0.78 +/- 0.27) log(M_BH) + (0.67 +/- 0.12) log(L_X), in
broad agreement with prior efforts. Owing to the nature of our sample, the
plane can be turned into an effective mass predictor. When the full sample is
considered, masses are predicted less accurately than with the well-known
M-sigma relation. If obscured AGN are excluded, the plane is potentially a
better predictor than other scaling measures.

group-level static and dynamic analyses of terrorist events worldwide from

production of violent events tends to accelerate with increasing size and
experience. This coupling of frequency, experience and size arises from a
fundamental positive feedback loop in which attacks lead to growth which leads
to increased production of new attacks. In contrast, event severity is
independent of both size and experience. Thus larger, more experienced
organizations are more deadly because they attack more frequently, not because
their attacks are more deadly, and large events are equally likely to come from
large and small organizations. These results hold across political ideologies
and time, suggesting that the frequency and severity of terrorism may be
constrained by fundamental processes.

formation histories of red sequence galaxies, using linestrength indices and
mass-to-light ratios as complementary constraints on their stellar age
distribution. We construct simple parametric models of the star formation
history that bracket a range of scenarios, and fit these models to the
linestrength indices of low-redshift cluster red-sequence galaxies. For giant
galaxies, we confirm the downsizing trend. We find, however, that this trend
flattens or reverses at sigma < 70 km/s. We then compare predicted stellar
mass-to-light ratios with dynamical mass-to-light ratios derived from the
Fundamental Plane (FP), or by the SAURON group. For galaxies with sigma ~ 70
km/s, models with a ""frosting"" of young stars and models with exponential star
formation histories have stellar mass-to-light ratios that are larger than
observed dynamical mass-to-light ratios by factors of 1.7 and 1.4,
respectively, and so are rejected. The SSP model is consistent with the FP, and
requires a modest amount of dark matter (20-30%) to account for the difference
between stellar and dynamical mass-to-light ratios. A model in which star
formation was ""quenched"" at intermediate ages is also consistent with the
observations. We find that the contribution of stellar populations to the
""tilt"" of the FP is highly dependent on the assumed star-formation history: for
the SSP model, the tilt of the FP is driven primarily by stellar-population
effects. For a quenched model, two-thirds of the tilt is due to stellar
populations and only one third is due to dark matter or non-homology.

loss or advection are used as the initial configurations of the disc. As a
result, from the initial advective disc models with alpha =0.001 and 0.1, we
obtain the total luminosities 2.5x10^{40} and 2.0x10^{40} erg/s. The total
mass-outflow rates are 4x10^{-5} and 10^{-4} solar-mass/yr and the rates of the
relativistic axial outflows in a small half opening angle of 1 degree are about
10^{-6} solar-mass/yr: the values generally consistent with the corresponding
observed rates of the wind and the jets, respectively. From the initial models
with mass loss but without advection, we obtain the total mass-outflow and
axial outflow rates smaller than or comparable to the observed rates of the
wind and the jets respectively, depending on alpha. In the advective disc model
with alpha=0.1, the initially radiation-pressure dominant, optically thick disc
evolves to the gas-pressure dominated, optically thin state in the inner region
of the disc, and the inner disc is unstable. Consequently, we find remarkable
modulations of the disc luminosity and the accretion rate through the inner
edge. These modulations manifest themselves as the recurrent hot blobs with
high temperatures and low densities at the disc plane, which develop outward
and upward and produce the QPOs-like variability of the total luminosity with
an amplitude of a factor of 2 and quasi-periods of 10 -- 25 s. This may explain
the massive jet ejection and the QPOs phenomena observed in SS 433.

spatially-lineal, universe. The cosmic substratum is formed by an {\it
inflaton} field plus a matter component, sources of the 2D gravitational field;
the degrees of freedom also include the presence of a dilaton field. We show
that this combination permits, among other scenarios, the simulation of a
period of inflation, that would be followed by a (bosonic/fermionic) matter
dominated era. We also analyse how quantum effects contribute to the destiny of
the expansion, given the fact that in 2D we have a consistent (renormalizable)
quantum theory of gravity. The dynamical behavior of the system follows from
the solution of the gravitational field equations, the (Klein-Gordon and Dirac)
equations for the sources and the dilaton field equation. Consistent
(accelerated) regimes are present among the solutions of the 2D equations; the
results depend strongly on the initial conditions used for the dilaton field.

surface brightness profiles of nine galaxies show regions with blue UV-optical
colours suggesting recent star formation. Five of these show blue integrated
UV-optical colours that set them aside in the NUV integrated colour-magnitude
relation. They also have other properties confirming they have had recent star
formation, in particular H_beta absorption higher than expected for a quiescent
population and a higher CO detection rate. NUV-blue galaxies are generally
drawn from the lower stellar velocity dispersion and thus lower dynamical mass
part of the sample. We have also constructed the first UV Fundamental Planes
and show that NUV blue galaxies bias the slopes and increase the scatters. If
they are eliminated the fits get closer to expectations from the virial
theorem. Although our analysis is based on a limited sample, it seems that a
dominant fraction of the tilt and scatter of the UV Fundamental Planes is due
to the presence of young stars in preferentially low-mass early-type galaxies.
Interestingly, the UV-optical radial colour profiles reveal a variety of
behaviours, with many galaxies showing signs of recent star formation, a
central UV-upturn phenomenon, smooth but large-scale age and metallicity
gradients, and in many cases a combination of these. In addition, FUV-NUV and
FUV-V colours even bluer than those normally associated with UV-upturn galaxies
are observed at the centre of some quiescent galaxies. Four out of the five
UV-upturn galaxies are slow rotators. These objects should thus pose
interesting challenges to stellar evolutionary models of the UV-upturn.

(CA-MRSA), a novel strain of MRSA, has recently emerged and rapidly spread in
the community. Invasion into the hospital setting with replacement of the
hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) has also been documented. Co-colonization with
both CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA would have important clinical implications given
differences in antimicrobial susceptibility profiles and the potential for
exchange of genetic information.
  Methods: A deterministic mathematical model was developed to characterize the
transmission dynamics of HA-MRSA and CA-MRSA in the hospital setting and to
quantify the emergence of co-colonization with both strains.
  Results: The model analysis shows that the state of co-colonization becomes
endemic over time and that there is no competitive exclusion of either strain.
Increasing the length of stay or rate of hospital entry among patients
colonized with CA-MRSA leads to a rapid increase in the co-colonized state.
Compared to MRSA decolonization strategy, improving hand hygiene compliance has
the greatest impact on decreasing the prevalence of HA-MRSA, CA-MRSA and the
co-colonized state.
  Conclusions: The model predicts that with the expanding community reservoir
of CA-MRSA, the majority of hospitalized patients will become colonized with
both CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA.

Values of Vesc are computed using Multi Gaussian Expansion (MGE) photometric
fitting and axisymmetric, anisotropic Jeans' dynamical modelling simultaneously
on HST and ground-based images. We determine line strengths and escape
velocities at multiple radii within each galaxy, allowing an investigation of
the correlation within individual galaxies as well as amongst galaxies. We find
a tight correlation between Vesc and the line-strength indices. For Mgb we find
that this correlation exists not only between different galaxies but also
inside individual galaxies - it is both a local and global correlation. The
relation within individual galaxies has the same slope and offset as the global
relation to a good level of agreement, though there is significant intrinsic
scatter in the local gradients. We transform our line strength index
measurements to the single stellar population (SSP) equivalent age (t),
metallicity ([Z/H]) and enhancement ([$\alpha$/Fe]) and carry out a principal
component analysis of our SSP and Vesc data. We find that in this
four-dimensional parameter space the galaxies in our sample are to a good

dark matter, and here we test the 11 eV sterile neutrino - used to fit the
first three acoustic peaks of the cosmic microwave background - by
investigating their equilibrium distributions in 30 groups and clusters over a
wide range of temperatures. Knowing both the sterile neutrino density and
velocity dispersion tells us the Tremaine-Gunn phase-space limit at all radii.
We find that all 30 systems serendipitously reach the Tremaine-Gunn limit by
the centre, which means a portion of the dynamical mass must always be covered
by the brightest cluster galaxy. Interestingly, the typical fitted K-band
mass-to-light ratio is unity and at most 1.2, which is very consistent -
although leaving no margin for error - with stellar population synthesis
models. Amidst the sample there are several special cases including the Coma
cluster (for which dark matter was first proposed), NGC 720 (where geometrical
evidence for dark matter was found) and the bullet cluster (where dark matter -
of some kind - in clusters was directly proven to exist). We demonstrate that
11 eV sterile neutrinos are unlikely to influence spiral galaxy rotation
curves, as they don't influence even some very massive early-types (NGC 4125
and NGC 6482). Finally, we conclude that it is intriguing that the minimum mass
of sterile neutrino particle that can match the cosmic microwave background is
identical to the minimum mass found here to be consistent with equilibrium

structure associated with the most massive of these sources, traced at small
scales (~50 AU) by the water masers. At large scales (~1000 AU) we find a
velocity gradient in the SO2 molecular emission with a barely resolved
structure that can be modeled as a rotating ring or two separate objects. The
velocity gradients of the masers and of the molecular emission have the same
sense and may trace the same structure at different size scales. The position
angles of the structures associated with the velocity gradients are roughly
perpendicular to the outflow axis observed in radio continuum and several
molecular tracers. We estimate the mass of the most massive central source to
be around 30 solar masses from the velocity gradient in the water maser
emission. The main source of error in this estimate is the radius of the
rotating structure. We also find water masers that are associated with the
large scale molecular outflow of the system, as well as water masers that are

rotators but find a much larger excess of slow rotating asteroids (~15% of our

is proportional to the square of the axis-ratio, (b/a)^2, and may be bi-modal.

mechanics (BM) is introduced to study a multiphoton process of atoms
interacting with the intense laser field: above-threshold ionization (ATI).
Quantum trajectory of an atomic electron in intense laser field is obtained
from the Bohm-Newton equation first and then the energy of the photoelectron is
gained from its trajectory. With energies of an ensemble of photoelectrons, we
obtain the ATI spectrum which is consistent with the previous theoretical and
experimental results. Comparing BM with the classical trajectory Monte-Carlo
method, we conclude that quantum potential may play a key role to reproduce the
spectrum of ATI. Our work may present a new approach to understanding quantum
phenomena in intense laser-atom physics with the image of trajectory.

perturbations evolve with redshifts, and their specific behaviors depend on the

density perturbation is at the level of $10^{-6}$ for cluster-sized halos. The
perturbation amplitude decreases with the decrease of the halo mass. At a given

transitions in two models of linear elastic/perfectly-plastic random
heterogeneous materials: (1) a composite made of locally isotropic grains with
weak random fluctuations in elastic moduli and/or yield limits; and (2) a
polycrystal made of randomly oriented anisotropic grains. In each case, the
spatial assignment of material randomness is a non-fractal, strict-white-noise
field on a 256 x 256 square lattice of homogeneous, square-shaped grains; the
flow rule in each grain follows associated plasticity. These lattices are
subjected to simple shear loading increasing through either one of three
macroscopically uniform boundary conditions (kinematic, mixed-orthogonal or
traction), admitted by the Hill-Mandel condition. Upon following the evolution
of a set of grains that become plastic, we find that it has a fractal dimension
increasing from 0 towards 2 as the material transitions from elastic to
perfectly-plastic. While the grains possess sharp elastic-plastic stress-strain
curves, the overall stress-strain responses are smooth and asymptote toward
perfectly-plastic flows; these responses and the fractal dimension-strain
curves are almost identical for three different loadings. The randomness in
elastic moduli alone is sufficient to generate fractal patterns at the
transition, but has a weaker effect than the randomness in yield limits. In the
model with isotropic grains, as the random fluctuations vanish (i.e. the
composite becomes a homogeneous body), a sharp elastic-plastic transition is

  for Wireless CDMA Networks","submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, June 2009",,,,"cs.IT cs.GT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The issue of non-cooperative transceiver optimization in the uplink of a
multiuser wireless code division multiple access data network with
widely-linear detection at the receiver is considered. While previous work in
this area has focused on a simple real signal model, in this paper a baseband
complex representation of the data is used, so as to properly take into account
the I and Q components of the received signal. For the case in which the
received signal is improper, a widely-linear reception structure, processing
separately the data and their complex conjugates, is considered. Several
non-cooperative resource allocation games are considered for this new scenario,
and the performance gains granted by the use of widely-linear detection are
assessed through theoretical analysis. Numerical results confirm the validity
of the theoretical findings, and show that exploiting the improper nature of
the data in non-cooperative resource allocation brings remarkable performance
improvements in multiuser wireless systems.

major foreground to CMB fluctuations. Well correlated to dust emission at 100
$\mu$m, the anomalous emission is interstellar but its origin is still debated.
Some possible explanations relate it to dust: emission of spinning, small
(nanometric) grains carrying a permanent electric dipole or magnetic
fluctuations in larger (submicronic) grains. To probe the origin of the
anomalous emission, we compare microwave data to dust IR emission and search
for specific signatures predicted by models of spinning dust. For the anomalous
emission, we use the 23 GHz all-sky map deduced from WMAP data by
Miville-Deschenes et al. (2008). The dust emission is traced by IRAS data.
Models show that spinning dust emission is little sensitive to the intensity of
the radiation field (Go) for 10<nu<30 GHz while the corresponding mid-IR
emission is proportional to Go. To test this behaviour in our comparison, we
derive Go from the dust temperature maps of Schlegel et al. (1998). From
all-sky maps, we show that the anomalous emission is better correlated to the
emission of small grains (at 12 $\mu$m) than to that of big grains (at 100
$\mu$m). In addition we show that the former correlation is significantly
improved when the 12 $\mu$m flux is divided by Go, as predicted by current
models of spinning dust.

the ability of the segment polarity network to resist transient changes. We
identify paths along which alternate unviable states are reached, and hence
critical nodes whose state changes lead the system away from the wild-type
state. We find that the system appears to be more sensitive to changes that
involve activation of normally inactive nodes. Through a simulation of the heat
shock response, we show how a localized perturbation in one parasegment is more
deleterious than a global perturbation affecting all parasegments. We identify
the sequence of events involved in the recovery of the system from a global
transient heat shock condition. Finally we discuss these results in terms of

nearby regions within the 5-10 Myr age range, during which the disk fraction
decreases dramatically and giant planet formation must come to an end. For the
15 low-mass members, we measure a disk fraction ~50%, high for their 8 Myr age,
and 4 of the 8 disks lack near-IR excesses, consistent with the empirical
definition of ""transition'' disks. Most of the disks are comparable to
geometrically flat disks. The comparison with regions of different ages
suggests that at least some of the ""transition"" disks may represent the normal
type of disk around low-mass stars. Therefore, their flattened structure and
inner holes may be related to other factors (initial masses of the disk and the
star, environment, binarity), rather than to pure time evolution. We analyze
the silicate dust in the disk atmosphere, finding moderate crystalline
fractions (~10-30%) and typical grain sizes ~1-3 micron, without any
characteristic trend in the composition. These results are common to other
regions of different ages, suggesting that the initial grain processing occurs
very early in the disk lifetime (<1 Myr). Large grain sizes in the disk
atmosphere cannot be used as a proxy for age, but are likely related to higher
disk turbulence. The dust mineralogy varies between the 8-12micron and the
20-30 micron features, suggesting high temperature dust processing and little
radial mixing. Finally, the analysis of IR and optical data on the B9 star Eta
Cha reveals that it is probably surrounded by a young debris disk with a large
inner hole, instead of being a classical Be star.

to gauge fixing, so the amplitudes are formally independent of the constant

the picture changing operators are not BRST closed inside correlators and the

the gauge fixing condition implicit in the existing minimal amplitude

non-decoupling of BRST exact states. As discussed in hep-th/0406055, a
manifestly Lorentz invariant prescription can be obtained by integrating over

overcomplete semicoherent basis of vortex states, specially devoted to the
study of the Hamiltonian quantum dynamics of electrons at high magnetic fields
and in an arbitrary potential landscape smooth on the scale of the magnetic
length. This formalism is used here to derive the exact Green's function for an
arbitrary quadratic potential in the special limit where Landau level mixing
becomes negligible. This solution remarkably embraces under a unified form the
cases of confining and unconfining quadratic potentials. This property results
from the fact that the overcomplete vortex representation provides a more
general type of spectral decomposition of the Hamiltonian operator than usually
considered. Whereas confining potentials are naturally characterized by
quantization effects, lifetime effects emerge instead in the case of
saddle-point potentials. Our derivation proves that the appearance of lifetimes
has for origin the instability of the dynamics due to quantum tunneling at
saddle points of the potential landscape. In fact, the overcompleteness of the
vortex representation reveals an intrinsic microscopic irreversibility of the
states synonymous with a spontaneous breaking of the time symmetry exhibited by
the Hamiltonian dynamics.

combination of measurements from classical ground-based observations (for

the non-negativity of partially transposed density matrix, and thus this

collisions as compared to their scaled expectation from proton-proton
collisions due to the interaction of hard partons with the hot and dense QCD
medium in A-A collisions is experimentally a well established phenomenon.
Focusing on leading hadrons produced in hard processes, the medium effect
appears as energy loss. Beyond that, the question is how the lost energy is
redistributed in the medium. With increased experimental statistics and most
importantly the kinematic range of the LHC, studying the properties of full
jets rather than leading hadrons is becoming feasible. On the theory side,
analytic models and Monte-Carlo (MC) codes for in-medium shower evolution are
being developed to describe jets in the medium. In this paper, expectations for
medium-modified jet observables, the jet shapes, the thrust distribution and
the n-jet fraction, are computed with the MC code YaJEM for various scenarios
of the parton-medium interaction which all are consistent with high P_T hadron
suppression data. The computation is done at 20 and 100 GeV jet energy,

OB-stars. We first summarize the fundamental theoretical predictions, and then
compare these to observational results (including the VLT-FLAMES survey of
massive stars). Especially we focus on the mass loss-metallicity dependence and
on the so-called bi-stability jump.
  Subsequently we concentrate on two urgent problems, weak winds and wind
clumping, that have been identified from various diagnostics and that challenge
our present understanding of radiation driven winds. We discuss the problems of
``measuring'' mass-loss rates from weak winds and the potential of the near
infrared, Br-alpha line as a tool to enable a more precise quantification, and
comment on physical explanations for mass-loss rates that are much lower than
predicted by the standard model.
  Wind clumping, conventionally interpreted as the consequence of a strong
instability inherent to radiative line-driving, has severe implications for the
interpretation of observational diagnostics, since derived mass-loss rates are
usually overestimated when clumping is present but ignored in the analyses.
Simplified techniques to account for clumping indicate overestimates by factors
of 2 to 10, or even more. If actually true, these results would have a dramatic
impact on the evolution of, and the feedback from, massive stars. We discuss
ongoing attempts (including own work) to interprete the corresponding
observations in terms of more sophisticated models. By allowing for porosity in
density and velocity space, and for a non-void inter-clump medium, such models
might require only moderate reductions of mass-loss rates.

mixing approximation (IMA). This assumption is probably not realistic as
indicated by the existence of chemical inhomogeneities, although current
chemical evolution models of the Milky Way can reproduce the majority of the
observational constraints under the IMA. The aim of this paper is to test
whether relaxing this approximation in a detailed chemical evolution model can
improve or worsen the agreement with observations. To do that, we investigated
two possible causes for relaxing of the instantaneous mixing: i) the ``galactic
fountain time delay effect'' and ii) the ``metal cooling time delay effect''.
We found that the effect of galactic fountains is negligible if an average time
delay of 0.1 Gyr, as suggested in a previous paper, is assumed. Longer time
delays produce differences in the results but they are not realistic. We also
found that the O abundance gradient in the disk is not affected by galactic
fountains. The metal cooling time delays produce strong effects on the
evolution of the chemical abundances only if we adopt stellar yields depending
on metallicity. If instead, the yields computed for to the solar chemical
composition are adopted, negligible effects are produced, as in the case of the
galactic fountain delay. The relaxation of the IMA by means of the galactic
fountain model, where the delay is considered only for massive stars and only
in the disk, does not affect the chemical evolution results. The combination of
metal dependent yields and time delay in the chemical enrichment from all stars
starting from the halo phase, instead, produces results at variance with
observations.

cascades of energy in 3D EMHD turbulence are found to be suppressed in all

the semi-local universe into account, there may be no need to postulate an
accelerating expansion of the universe despite recent type Ia supernova data.
Local curvatures must be integrated (over all space) to obtain the global
curvature of the universe, which seems to be very close to zero from cosmic
microwave background data. As gravitational structure formation creates bound
regions of positive curvature, the regions in between become negatively curved
in order to comply with a vanishing global curvature. The actual dynamics of
the universe is altered due to the self-induced inhomogeneities, again more
prominently so as structure formation progresses. Furthermore, this negative
curvature will increase as a function of time as structure formation proceeds,
which mimics the effect of ""dark energy"" with negative pressure. Hence, the
""acceleration"" may be merely a mirage. We make a qualitative and
semi-quantitative analysis, using newtonian gravity corrected for special
relativistic effects, which works surprisingly well, to corroborate and
illustrate/visualize these statements. This article may be seen as a plea to
start taking seriously the observed inhomogeneous distribution and the
nonlinearities of nonperturbative general relativity, and their impact on the

branch (RGB) and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in the globular clusters
M13, M15, and M92 are constructed to derive mass loss rates. The model spectra
are compared to the observations obtained with the Hectochelle on the MMT
telescope. These stars show strong Halpha emissions and blue-shifted Halpha
cores signaling that mass outflow is present in all stars. Outflow velocities
of 3-19 km/s, larger than indicated by Halpha profiles, are needed in the upper
chromosphere to achieve good agreement between the model spectra and the
observations. The resulting mass loss rates range from 0.6*10^{-9} to 5*10^{-9}
Msun/yr, which are about an order of magnitude lower than predicted from
""Reimers' law"" or inferred from the infrared excess of similar stars. The mass
loss rate increases slightly with luminosity and with decreasing effective
temperature. Stars in the more metal-rich M13 have higher mass loss rates by a
factor of ~2 than in the metal-poor clusters M15 and M92. A fit to the mass
loss rates is given by: M [Msun/yr] = 0.092 * L^{0.16} * Teff^{-2.02} *
A^{0.37} where A=10^[Fe/H]. Multiple observations of stars revealed one object
in M15, K757, in which the mass outflow increased by a factor of 6 between two
observations separated by 18 months. Other stars showed changes in mass loss
rate by a factor of 1.5 or less.

  We propose proactive algorithms for merging different streams of

decouples the decision point from the actual merging point. Sensor-enabled cars
allow us to decide where and when a car merges before it arrives at the actual
merging point. This leads to a significant improvement in traffic flow as
velocities can be adjusted appropriately. We compare proactive merging

homogeneous and isotropic is crucial to our current understanding of cosmology.
In this paper we test if the observed galaxy distribution is actually
homogeneous on large scales. We have carried out a multifractal analysis of the
galaxy distribution in a volume limited subsample from the SDSS DR6. This
considers the scaling properties of different moments of galaxy number counts
in spheres of varying radius $r$ centered on galaxies. This analysis gives the
spectrum of generalized dimension $D_q(r)$, where $q >0$ quantifies the scaling
properties in overdense regions and $q<0$ in underdense regions. We expect
$D_q(r)=3$ for a homogeneous, random point distribution.
  In our analysis we have determined $D_q(r)$ in the range $-4 \le q \le 4$ and
$7 \le r \le 98 h^{-1} {\rm Mpc}$. In addition to the SDSS data we have
analysed several random samples which are homogeneous by construction.
Simulated galaxy samples generated from dark matter N-body simulations and the
Millennium Run were also analysed. The SDSS data is considered to be
homogeneous if the measured $D_q$ is consistent with that of the random
samples. We find that the galaxy distribution becomes homogeneous at a
length-scale between 60 and $70 h^{-1} {\rm Mpc}$. The galaxy distribution, we
find, is homogeneous at length-scales greater than $70 h^{-1} {\rm Mpc}$. This
is consistent with earlier works which find the transition to homogeneity at
around $70 h^{-1} {\rm Mpc}$.

The colour distributions of cluster candidates appear multi-modal. Although
firm age constraints need the use of more age sensitive indicators, the
comparison of cluster candidate colours with the colours of Galactic and
Magellanic Clouds star clusters, suggests an age difference between the various
sub-peaks, with a red old sub-system, a rich population of intermediate age (~1
Gyr), and a blue tail of very young (below ~100 Myr) clusters. The luminosity
functions appear normal for this type of galaxy, as for the distribution of
cluster effective radii (Reff). Our analysis suggests the presence of a peak in
the Reff distribution at ~3.0 pc, with blue (likely young) cluster candidates
showing smaller radii respect to red (likely old) objects. Finally, inspecting
the properties of candidate globular clusters, we find a colour distribution
matching with Galactic Globulars, with a median [Fe/H] -1.5 dex, though a non
negligible tail towards lower metallicities is also present.

break between an inertial range of turbulent fluctuations at higher frequencies
and a ""$1/f$"" like region at lower frequencies. In the ecliptic plane at $\sim
1$ AU, this break occurs approximately at timescales of a few hours, and is
observed in the power spectra of components of velocity and magnetic field. The
""$1/f$"" energy range is of more direct coronal origin than the inertial range,
and carries signatures of the complex magnetic field structure of the solar
corona, and of footpoint stirring in the solar photosphere. To quantify the
scaling properties we use generic statistical methods such as generalised
structure functions and PDFs, focusing on solar cycle dependence and on
anisotropy with respect to the background magnetic field. We present structure
function analysis of magnetic and velocity field fluctuations, using a novel
technique to decompose the fluctuations into directions parallel and
perpendicular to the mean local background magnetic field. Whilst the magnetic
field is close to ""$1/f$"", we show that the velocity field is ""$1/f^{\alpha}$""
with $\alpha\neq1$. For the velocity, the value of $\alpha$ varies between
parallel and perpendicular fluctuations and with the solar cycle. There is also
variation in $\alpha$ with solar wind speed. We have examined the PDFs in the
fast, quiet solar wind and intriguingly, whilst parallel and perpendicular are
distinct, both the ${\boldmath$B$}$ field and velocity show the same PDF of
their perpendicular flucutations, which is close to gamma or inverse Gumbel.
These results point to distinct physical processes in the corona, and to their
mapping out into the solar wind. The scaling exponents obtained constrain the

globular clusters with high-quality colour-magnitude diagrams and
well-determined ages. The four parameters adopted for the analysis are:
metallicity, age, maximum temperature on the horizontal branch, and absolute V
magnitude. Our cladistic analysis breaks the sample into three novel groups. An
a posteriori kinematical analysis puts groups 1 and 2 in the halo, and group 3
in the thick disc. The halo and disc clusters separately follow a
luminosity-metallicity relation of much weaker slope than galaxies. This
property is used to propose a new criterion for distinguishing halo and disc
clusters. A comparison of the distinct properties of the two halo groups with
those of Galactic halo field stars indicates that the clusters of group 1
originated in the inner halo, while those of group 2 formed in the outer halo
of the Galaxy. The inner halo clusters were presumably initially the most
massive one, which allowed the formation of more strongly helium-enriched
second generation stars, thus explaining the presence of Cepheids and of very
hot horizontal-branch stars exclusively in this group. We thus conclude that
the ""second parameter"" is linked to the environment in which globular clusters
form, the inner halo favouring the formation of the most massive clusters which
subsequently become more strongly self-enriched than their counterparts of the

necessary to establish these properties. Here we describe an efficient

potential interactions, it is shown that quenches from stochastic
configurations and quenches from equilibrium liquid Molecular Dynamics (MD)
configurations produce statistically identical distributions of the structural

operate autonomously, be battery powered and have very limited computational
capabilities. This makes the task of protecting a sensor network against
misbehavior or possible malfunction a challenging problem. In this document we
discuss performance of Artificial immune systems (AIS) when used as the
mechanism for detecting misbehavior.
  We show that (i) mechanism of the AIS have to be carefully applied in order
to avoid security weaknesses, (ii) the choice of genes and their interaction
have a profound influence on the performance of the AIS, (iii) randomly created
detectors do not comply with limitations imposed by communications protocols
and (iv) the data traffic pattern seems not to impact significantly the overall
performance.
  We identified a specific MAC layer based gene that showed to be especially
useful for detection; genes measure a network's performance from a node's
viewpoint. Furthermore, we identified an interesting complementarity property
of genes; this property exploits the local nature of sensor networks and moves
the burden of excessive communication from normally behaving nodes to
misbehaving nodes. These results have a direct impact on the design of AIS for
sensor networks and on engineering of sensor networks.

flow fluctuations and nonflow effects. It is explained why the event-plane
method yields estimates between the two-particle correlation methods and the
multiparticle correlation methods. It is argued that nonflow effects and
fluctuations cannot be disentangled without other assumptions. However, we
provide equations where, with reasonable assumptions about fluctuations and
nonflow, all measured values of elliptic flow converge to a unique mean
elliptic flow in the participant plane. Thus, the 20% spread in observed
elliptic flow measurements from different analysis methods is no longer
mysterious.

correlations among more general non-signalling models. Here we present results
going in this direction; namely we show that part of the boundary of quantum
correlations actually emerges from information causality.

to give further examples of strong exceptional sequences of vector bundles on

the problem of wavefunction uncollapse: Given an unknown state that has been
disturbed by a generalized measurement, restore the state to its initial
configuration. We describe how this is probabilistically possible with a
subsequent measurement that involves erasing the information extracted about
the state in the first measurement. The general theory of abstract measurements
is discussed, focusing on quantum information aspects of the problem, in
addition to investigating a variety of specific physical situations and
explicit measurement strategies. Several systems are considered in detail: the
quantum double dot charge qubit measured by a quantum point contact (with and
without Hamiltonian dynamics), the superconducting phase qubit monitored by a
SQUID detector, and an arbitrary number of entangled charge qubits.
Furthermore, uncollapse strategies for the quantum dot electron spin qubit, and
the optical polarization qubit are also reviewed. For each of these systems the
physics of the continuous measurement process, the strategy required to ideally
uncollapse the wavefunction, as well as the statistical features associated
with the measurement is discussed. We also summarize the recent experimental
realization of two of these systems, the phase qubit and the polarization
qubit.

zero, we show that the value that an integral takes on the inverse Drinfel'd

most by a fourth root of unity. This can be reformulated by saying that the
central charge of the Hopf algebra is an integer. If the dimension of the Hopf
algebra is odd, we show that these two values differ at most by a sign, which
can be reformulated by saying that the central charge is even. We give a
precise condition on the dimension that determines whether the plus sign or the
minus sign occurs. To formulate our results, we use the language of modular

Assuming that the film width is less than the field wave length, we can solve
the wave equation and reduce the problem to a system of generalized Bloch
equations describing the resonant atoms. We compute the stationary solutions
for a constant irradiation of the film. Superimposing a small amplitude linear
wave we compute the reflection and transmission coefficients. From these, one
can then deduce the different parameters of the model. We believe this
technique could be used in experiments to obtain the medium atomic and
relaxation parameters.
