gravity with a negative cosmological constant has been proposed to be
holographically dual to a two-dimensional conformal field theory. We extend
this proposal to both positive and vanishing values of the cosmological
constant where stretched warped anti-de Sitter space is found to be a solution.
For positive cosmological constant, another class of warped solutions is
obtained by a spacelike (timelike) line fibration over Lorentzian (Euclidean)
two-dimensional de Sitter space. These solutions exhibit a cosmological horizon
and Hawking temperature much like de Sitter space. Global identifications of
this warped de Sitter space may contain a horizon in addition to the
cosmological one. At a degenerate point, warped de Sitter space becomes a
fibration over two-dimensional flat space. Finally, we study scalar waves in
these backgrounds. Scalars in stretched warped anti-de Sitter space exhibit
superradiance which can be interpreted as Schwinger pair production of charged
particles in two-dimensional anti-de Sitter space.

function of the scattering matrix, for which we have to treat a new set of

connected to the ac and dc conductances, quantities of particular interest for

These expressions allow us to obtain some asymptotics in small time of the heat

rather the deviations from mass-degeneracy-symmetry without inventing exact

bulk, we obtain the general flavor structure of the Higgs couplings to
fermions. These couplings will be generically misaligned with respect to the
fermion mass matrix, producing large and potentially dangerous flavor changing
neutral currents (FCNC's). As recently pointed out in [arXiv:0906.1542], a
similar effect is expected from the point of view of a composite Higgs sector,
which corresponds to a 4D theory dual to the 5D setup by the AdS-CFT
correspondence. We also point out that the effect is independent of the
geographical nature of the Higgs (bulk or brane localized), and specifically
that it does not go away as the Higgs is pushed towards the IR boundary. The
FCNC's mediated by a light enough Higgs (specially their contribution to
$\epsilon_K$) could become of comparable size as the ones coming from the
exchange of Kaluza-Klein (KK) gluons. Moreover, both sources of flavor
violation are complementary since they have inverse dependence on the 5D Yukawa
couplings, such that we cannot decouple the flavor violation effects by
increasing or decreasing these couplings. We also find that for KK scales of a
few TeV, the Higgs couplings to third generation fermions could experience
suppressions of up to 40% while the rest of diagonal couplings would suffer
much milder corrections. Potential LHC signatures like the Higgs flavor
violating decays $h\to\mu\tau$ or $h\to tc$, or the exotic top decay channel
$t\to c h$, are finally addressed.

44 hours after the July 28 outburst, known for its ultrafast variability. An
unprecedented 6 to 8 hours of uninterrupted coverage was achieved, with spectra
and light curves measured down to 7 and 2-minute timescales, respectively. The
gamma-ray flux reached a maximum of 11x the Crab flux (>400 GeV), with

The cores of massive, short-lived stars undergo gravitational core collapse and
typically eject a few solar masses during their explosion. These are thought to
appear as as type Ib/c and II SNe, and are associated with young stellar
populations. A type Ia SN is thought to arise from the thermonuclear detonation
of a white dwarf star composed mainly of carbon and oxygen, whose mass
approaches the Chandrasekhar limit. Such SNe are observed in both young and old
stellar environments. Here we report our discovery of the faint type Ib SN
2005E in the halo of the nearby isolated galaxy, NGC 1032.
  The lack of any trace of recent star formation near the SN location (Fig. 1),
and the very low derived ejected mass (~0.3 M_sun), argue strongly against a
core-collapse origin for this event. Spectroscopic observations and the derived
nucleosynthetic output show that the SN ejecta have high velocities and are
dominated by helium-burning products, indicating that SN 2005E was neither a
subluminous nor a regular SN Ia (Fig. 2). We have therefore found a new type of
stellar explosion, arising from a low-mass, old stellar system, likely
involving a binary with a primary white dwarf and a helium-rich secondary. The
SN ejecta contain more calcium than observed in any known type of SN and likely
additional large amounts of radioactive 44Ti. Such SNe may thus help resolve
fundamental physical puzzles, extending from the composition of the primitive
solar system and that of the oldest stars, to the Galactic production of
positrons.

sources observed in the IRS mapping mode, uniformly extracted nuclear spectra
are presented for the first time. We performed an analysis of the continuum
emission, the strength of the Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) and
astronomical silicate features of the sources. We find that on average, the
15-30 um slope of the continuum is alpha_{15-30}=-0.85+-0.61 for Seyfert 1s and
-1.53+-0.84 for Seyfert 2s, and there is substantial scatter in each type.
Moreover, nearly 32% of Seyfert 1s, and 9% of Seyfert 2s, display a peak in the
mid-infrared spectrum at 20 um, which is attributed to an additional hot dust
component. The PAH equivalent width decreases with increasing dust temperature,
asindicated by the global infrared color of the host galaxies. However, no
statistical difference in PAH equivalent width is detected between the two
Seyfert types, 1 and 2, of the same bolometric luminosity. The silicate
features at 9.7 and 18um in Seyfert 1 galaxies are rather weak, while Seyfert
2s are more likely to display strong silicate absorption. Those Seyfert 2s with
the highest silicate absorption also have high infrared luminosity and high
absorption (hydrogen column density N_H>10^23 cm^-2 as measured from the

spacing. Such ""hub-filament structure"" is associated with all of the nine young
stellar groups within 300 pc, forming low-mass stars. Similar properties are
seen in infrared dark clouds forming more massive stars. In a new model, an
initial clump in a uniform medium is compressed into a self-gravitating,
modulated layer. The outer layer resembles the modulated equilibrium of
Schmid-Burgk (1967) with nearly parallel filaments. The filaments converge onto
the compressed clump, which collapses to form stars with high efficiency. The
initial medium and condensations have densities similar to those in nearby
star-forming clouds and clumps. The predicted structures resemble observed
hub-filament systems in their size, shape, and column density, and in the
appearance of their filaments. These results suggest that hub-filament
structure associated with young stellar groups may arise from compression of
clumpy gas in molecular clouds.

deduce information about the clusters as well as the M82 post-starburst disk
and nuclear starburst environments. Spectroscopic age-dating places clusters in
the nucleus and disk between (7, 15) and (30, 270) Myr, with distribution peaks
at ~10 and ~140 Myr respectively. We find cluster radial velocities in the
range (-160, 220) km/s (wrt the galaxy centre) and line of sight Na I D
interstellar absorption line velocities in (-75, 200) km/s, in many cases
entirely decoupled from the clusters. As the disk cluster radial velocities lie
on the flat part of the galaxy rotation curve, we conclude that they comprise a
regularly orbiting system. Our observations suggest that the largest part of
the population was created as a result of the close encounter with M81 ~220 Myr
ago. Clusters in the nucleus are found in solid body rotation on the bar. The
possible detection of WR features in their spectra indicates that cluster
formation continues in the central starburst zone. We also report the potential
discovery of two old populous clusters in the halo of M82, aged >8 Gyr. Using
these measurements and simple dynamical considerations, we derive a toy model
for the invisible physical structure of the galaxy, and confirm the existence

globular cluster systems (GCSs). This work extends previous studies which
correlate the properties of the MMR with those of the host galaxy. Our combined
data sets show a mean trend for the metal-poor (MP) subpopulation which
corresponds to a scaling of heavy-element abundance with cluster mass Z ~
M^(0.30+/-0.05). No trend is seen for the metal-rich (MR) subpopulation which
has a scaling relation that is consistent with zero. We also find that the
scaling exponent is independent of the GCS specific frequency and host galaxy
luminosity, except perhaps for dwarf galaxies.
  We present new photometry in (g',i') obtained with Gemini/GMOS for the
globular cluster populations around the southern giant ellipticals NGC 5193 and
IC 4329. Both galaxies have rich cluster populations which show up as normal,
bimodal sequences in the colour-magnitude diagram.
  We test the observed MMRs and argue that they are statistically real, and not
an artifact caused by the method we used. We also argue against asymmetric
contamination causing the observed MMR as our mean results are no different
from other contamination-free studies. Finally, we compare our method to the
standard bimodal fitting method (KMM or RMIX) and find our results are
consistent.
  Interpretation of these results is consistent with recent models for globular
cluster formation in which the MMR is determined by GC self-enrichment during
their brief formation period.

parameters determined from SED fits with and without the IRAC data we find that
the IRAC photometry significantly improves the confidence intervals of Tau,
A_v, stellar mass, and SFR for individual galaxies, but does not systematically
alter the mean parameters of the sample. We use the IRAC data to assess how
well current stellar population synthesis codes describe the rest-frame NIR
SEDs of young galaxies where discrepancies between treatments of the TP-AGB
phase of stellar evolution are most pronounced. The models of Bruzual & Charlot
(2003), Maraston (2005), and Charlot & Bruzual (2008) all successfully
reproduce the SEDs of our galaxies with < 5% differences in the quality of fit;
however, the best-fit masses from each code differ systematically by as much as
a factor of 1.5, and other parameters vary more, up to factors of 2-3. A
comparison of best-fit stellar population parameters from different SPS codes,
dust laws, and metallicities shows that the choice of SPS code is the largest
systematic uncertainty in most parameters, and that systematic uncertainties
are typically larger than the formal random uncertainties. The SED fitting
confirms our previous result that galaxies with strongly suppressed star
formation account for ~ 50% of the K-bright population at z ~ 2.3; however, the
uncertainty in this fraction is large due to systematic differences in the

method to derive bounds in the mchi - <sigmaA*v> plane by using radio continuum
observations of Messier 33, paying particular attention to a low emitting Radio
Cavity. The comparison of the expected radio emission due to the galactic dark
matter distribution with the observed one provides bounds which are comparable
to those obtained from a similar analysis of the Milky Way. Remarkably, the
present results are simply based on archival data and thus largely improvable
by means of specifically tailored observations. The potentiality of the method
compared with more standard searches is discussed by considering the optimistic
situation of a vanishing flux (within the experimental sensitivity) measured
inside the cavity by a high resolution radio telescope like ALMA. Under the
best conditions our technique is able to produce bounds which are comparable to
the ones expected after five years of Fermi LAT data taking for an hadronic
annihilation channel. Furthermore, it allows to test the hypothesis that space
telescopes like Pamela and Fermi LAT are actually observing electrons and
positrons due to galactic dark matter annihilation into leptons.

Shlyakhtenko (arXiv:0903.2721). The interplay between ""type B"" and
""infinitesimal"" is also the object of the present paper. We study infinitesimal
freeness for a family of unital subalgebras A_1, ..., A_k in an infinitesimal
noncommutative probability space (A, phi, phi'), and we introduce a concept of
infinitesimal non-crossing cumulant functionals for (A, phi, phi'), obtained by
taking a formal derivative in the formula for usual non-crossing cumulants. We
prove that the infinitesimal freeness of A_1, ... A_k is equivalent to a

counterpart for a theorem of Speicher from ""usual"" free probability. We show
that the lattices of non-crossing partitions of type B appear in the
combinatorial study of (A, phi, phi'), in the formulas for infinitesimal
cumulants and when describing alternating products of infinitesimally free
random variables. As an application of alternating free products, we observe

GALEX satellite. The system was initially identified as an MgII absorption-line
system (z_abs=1.028) in the spectrum of SDSS QSO J0203-0910 (z_em=1.58). The
presence of unusually strong absorption due to metal lines of ZnII, CrII, MnII,
and FeII clearly suggested that it might be a DLA system with N{HI} > 2 x 10^20
atoms cm^-2. Follow-up GALEX NUV grism spectroscopy confirms the system
exhibits a DLA absorption line, with a measured HI column density of N{HI} =
1.50+/-0.45 x 10^21 atoms cm^-2. By combining the GALEX N{HI} determination
with the SDSS spectrum measurements of unsaturated metal-line absorption due to
ZnII, which is generally not depleted onto grains, we find that the system's
neutral-gas-phase metal abundance is [Zn/H] = -0.69+/-0.22, or ~20% solar. By
way of comparison, although this system has one of the largest Zn^+ column
densities, its metal abundances are comparable to other DLAs at z~1.
Measurements of the abundances of Cr, Fe, and Mn help to further pin down the
evolutionary state of the absorber.

Inversely, one can obtain accurate dependence of critical temperature on
density: one important consequence is that high density (solid) He cannot be a
BEC state of He atoms, with upper density accurately matching the observations.
We then use this model for the deconfinement phase transition of QCD-like gauge
theories, treated as BEC of (color)magnetic monopoles. We start with
Feynman-like approach without interaction, estimating the monopole mass at
$T_c$. Then we include monopole's Coulomb repulsion, and formulate a relation
between the mass, density and coupling which should be fulfilled at the
deconfinement point. We end up proposing various ways to test on the lattice

switching, polarization, symmetry locking, and dynamically induced pinning, can
occur for vortices in type-II superconductors in the presence of a honeycomb
pinning array and an ac or combined ac and dc drive. These effects occur at the
second matching field where there are two vortices per pinning site, and arise
due to the formation of vortex dimer states in the interstitial regions of the
honeycomb array. The orientation of the pinned and moving vortex dimers can be
controlled externally by the application of a drive. We term this a
polarization effect and demonstrate that it can lock or unlock the vortex
motion into different symmetry directions of the underlying pinning lattice. If
the moving vortices are locked into one direction, the motion can be switched
into a different direction by applying an additional bias drive, producing
sharp jumps in the transverse and longitudinal velocities. Further, the dc
vortex motion in one direction can be controlled directly by application of a
force in the perpendicular direction. When the moving dimers reorient, we find
a remarkable dynamical pinning effect in which the dimers jam when they become
perpendicular to the easy flow direction of the pinning lattice. Since
application of an external field can be used to switch off the vortex flow, we
term this a jamming transistor effect. These effects do not occur in triangular
pinning arrays due to the lack of the n-merization of the vortices in this
case. The switching and dynamical pinning effects demonstrated here may be
useful for the creation of new types of fluxtronic devices.

to superconducting nanowires in order to establish electric contacts. One
attractive method to surmount this difficulty is to synthesise superconducting
nanowires directly upon metal terminals such that the nanowires electrically
contact the metal surface. Here we demonstrate that this can be achieved by
electrodeposition in molten salts. The 39-K superconductor magnesium diboride
(MgB2) is electrodeposited to metal surfaces in the form of highly crystalline

to the increasing flare visibility and increasing active fraction for redder

most stars that flare are within 300 pc of the Galactic plane. We derive flare

many pairs of original medium (in a virtual space V') and inverse
transformation can give exactly the same anisotropic medium through the
conventional procedure of transformation optics. Non-uniqueness of these pairs

scale-free networks are no longer powerful amplifiers of cooperation when fair

Such weakening of the cooperation-promoting abilities of scale-free networks is
the result of a less biased flow of information in scale-free topologies,

maximum response time (waiting time) and maximum delay-factor and their

  - We show that FIFO (first-in first-out) is 2-competitive even when the page
sizes are different. Previously this was known only for unit-sized pages [10]
via a delicate argument. Our proof differs from [10] and is perhaps more
intuitive.
  - We give an online algorithm for maximum delay-factor that is
O(1/eps^2)-competitive with (1+\eps)-speed for unit-sized pages and with
(2+\eps)-speed for different sized pages. This improves on the algorithm in
[12] which required (2+\eps)-speed and (4+\eps)-speed respectively. In addition
we show that the algorithm and analysis can be extended to obtain the same
results for maximum weighted response time and delay factor.
  - We show that a natural greedy algorithm modeled after LWF

constant speed even in the setting of standard scheduling with unit-sized jobs.
This complements our upper bound and demonstrates the importance of the

for the strain, displacement and stress fields. This method allows us to
calculate the local elasticity tensor and to quantify the deviation from linear
elasticity (local Hooke's law) at different coarse-graining scales. From the
results a clear picture emerges of an amorphous material with strongly
spatially heterogeneous elastic moduli that simultaneously satisfies Hooke's
law at scales larger than a characteristic length scale of the order of five
interatomic distances. At this scale the glass appears as a composite material
composed of a rigid scaffoldingand of soft zones. Only recently calculated in
non homogeneous materials, the local elastic structure plays a crucial role in
the elasto-plastic response of the amorphous material. For a small macroscopic
shear strain the structures associated with the non-affine displacement field
appear directly related to the spatial structure of the elastic moduli.
Moreover for a larger macroscopic shear strain we show that zones of low shear
modulus concentrate most of the strain in form of plastic rearrangements. The
spatio-temporal evolution of this local elasticity map and its connection with
long term dynamical heterogeneity as well as with the plasticity in the
material is quantified. The possibility to use this local parameter as a
predictor of subsequent local plastic activity is also discussed.

Here one deals with the Harper model under the additional influence of the
discretized spin orbit interaction. Converting the spin-orbit interaction in
terms of discrete derivatives opens the way for analytical and numerical
studies. One finds coupled equations for the spin dependent wave functions,
which leads to an appreciable alteration of the nested energy subbands
characterizing the self-similar structure of the usual Harper spectrum. To this
aim the transfer matrix method has been applied to selected spin-up and
spin-down wavefunctions. Accordingly, very manifestations of spinfiltering and

sample of elliptical galaxies selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in
order to study the star-forming activity in local elliptical galaxies. Among
these 487 ellipticals we find that 13 EGs show unambiguous evidence of recent
star-formation activity betrayed by conspicuous nebular emission lines. Using
the evolutionary stellar population synthesis models and Lick absorption line
indices we derive stellar ages, metallicities, and $\alpha$-element abundances,
and thus reconstruct the star formation and chemical evolution history of the
star-forming elliptical galaxies (SFEGs) in our sample.
  We find that SFEGs have relative younger stellar population age, higher
metallicity, and lower stellar mass, and that their star formation history can
be well described by a recent minor and short starburst superimposed on old
stellar component. We also detect 11 E+A galaxies whose stellar population
properties are closer to those of quiescent (normal) ellipticals than to
star-forming ones. However, from the analysis of their absorption line indices,
we note that our E+A galaxies show a significant fraction of intermediate-age
stellar populations, remarkably different from the quiescent galaxies. This
might suggest an evolutionary link between E+As and star-forming ellipticals.
Finally, we confirm the relations between age, metallicity, $\alpha$ element
abundance, and stellar mass for local elliptical galaxies.

would lead to low weight codewords. A set of simulations are performed to
identify some of these configurations. Finally, we have provided a bound on the
logarithmic minimum distance of nonbinary codes, using a strategy similar to
the girth bound for binary codes. This bound has the same asymptotic behaviour
as that of binary codes.

  We present high-quality UBVRIz, as well as adaptive optics JHK_sL'
photometry, achieved under excellent conditions with the FORS1 and NAOS/CONICA
instruments at the VLT. We combine these data with re-analyzed archival Spitzer
Space Telescope data to construct a SED for the pulsar, and quantify the
contamination from the knot. We have also gathered optical imaging data from
1988 to 2008 from several telescopes in order to examine the predicted secular
decrease in luminosity.
  For the Crab Pulsar SED we find a spectral slope of alpha_nu = 0.27+-0.03 in
the optical/near-IR regime, when we exclude the contribution from the knot. For
the knot itself, we find a much redder slope of alpha_nu = -1.3 +- 0.1. Our
best estimate of the average decrease in luminosity for the pulsar is 2.9+-1.6
mmag per year. We have demonstrated the importance of the nearby knot in
precision measurements of the Crab Pulsar SED, in particular in the near-IR. We
have scrutinized the evidence for the traditional view of a synchrotron
self-absorption roll-over in the infrared, and find that these claims are
unfounded. We also find evidence for a secular decrease in the optical light
for the Crab Pulsar, in agreement with current pulsar spin-down models.
However, although our measurements of the decrease significantly improve on
previous investigations, the detection is still tentative. We finally point to
future observations that can improve the situation significantly.

localization structure which may under certain circumstances disagree with
(differential, algebraic) geometric ideas. String theory originated from such a
spectacular misinterpretation of a source-target embedding in which an inner
symmetry of the source object becomes the Lorentz symmetry of the target space.
The quantum localization reveals however that the resulting object is an
infinite component pointlike field. There are also other other areas in QFT
which suffered from having followed geometrical metaphors and payed too little
attention to the autonomous localization properties. This will be illustrated
in the concrete context of three examples. We also show that ""modular
localization "", i.e. the intrinsic localization theory of local quantum quantum
physics, leads to a radiacal new way of looking at (nonperturbative) QFT. For
the first time in the history of QFT there are now existence theorems for a
class of strictly renormalizable (i.e. not superrenormalizable) factorizable
QFTs which are based on these new concepts. The paper ends with some worrisome
sociological observations about the state of particle physics and the direction
in which it is heading. These remarks are based on the results presented in the

frameworks of fluid and kinetic drift wave theory. We show that the basic
ingredient necessary for the heating is the presence of density gradients in
the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field vector. Such density
gradients are a source of free energy for the excitation of drift waves. We use
only well established basic theory, verified experimentally in laboratory
plasmas. Two mechanisms of the energy exchange and heating are shown to take
place simultaneously: one due to the Landau effect in the direction parallel to
the magnetic field, and another one, stochastic heating, in the perpendicular
direction. The stochastic heating i) is due to the electrostatic nature of the
waves, ii) is more effective on ions than on electrons, iii) acts predominantly
in the perpendicular direction, iv) heats heavy ions more efficiently than
lighter ions, and v) may easily provide a drift wave heating rate that is
orders of magnitude above the value that is presently believed to be sufficient
for the coronal heating, i.e., $\simeq 6 \cdot 10^{-5} $J/(m$^3$s) for active
regions and $\simeq 8 \cdot 10^{-6} $J/(m$^3$s) for coronal holes. This heating
acts naturally through well known effects that are, however, beyond the current
standard models and theories.

loops and was used to derive an X-factor of 0.7(+/-0.1){\times}10^20 cm^-2 (K

the kinematics of the loops yields that the loops are rotating at ~47 km s-1
and expanding at ~141 km s^-1 at a radius of 670 pc from the center. Fukui et

network. We provide a first inventory of how the quiet chromosphere appears in
these two lines by comparing basic profile measurements in the form of image
displays, temporal-average displays, time slices, and pixel-by-pixel
correlations. We find that the two lines can be markedly dissimilar in their
rendering of the chromosphere, but that, nevertheless, both show evidence of
chromospheric heating, particularly in and around network: Halpha in its core
width, Ca II 854.2 in its brightness. We discuss venues for improved modeling.

  supersymmetric particle","68 pages",,,,"hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The wave function in the quantum theory of the O(N) extended supersymmetric
particle model describes a massless free field with spin N/2. This quantum
theory is here exactly solved in terms of gauge fields in arbitrary even
dimensions using only the basic quantum operators which include graded external
differentials, trace operators, index structure operators and their duals. The
resulting equations for the gauge fields are of first (N odd) or second order
(N even) and are shown to be generalized (Fang)-Fronsdal equations which are
fully gauge invariant since they include compensator fields in a natural way.
Local gauge invariant actions are first derived in analogy with the derivation
by Francia and Sagnotti in the symmetric case. Then a minimal formulation is
given within which it is easy to set up gauge invariant actions and here
appropriate actions for the above equations are proposed.
  In a second part it is shown that there exist projection operators from the
states of the field strengths (wave functions) to Weyl states (Weyl tensors)
expressed only in terms of the trace operators and their duals for integer
spins or in terms of the gamma trace operators and their duals for half-integer
spins. These Weyl states are not just fully gauge invariant but also invariant
under generalized Weyl transformations. If one lets the equations be determined
by the actions defined to be the squares of these Weyl tensors then the theory
is conformally invariant and the equations are of order N for the gauge fields
defined as in the exact theory. In d=4 this higher order conformal theory fits
into the framework for conformal higher spin theories set up by Fradkin,
Tseytlin and Linetski.

and this reduces to a known theorem in the univariate case. However, if
$d\ge2$, it is not known whether $L_2(B_2)$ admits a Riesz-basis sequence. On

new model for oscillators which adapt both their phases and frequencies. It is
found that this model naturally reproduces some observed phenomena that are not
qualitatively produced by the standard Kuramoto model, such as long waiting
times before the synchronization of clapping audiences. By assuming a
self-consistent steady state solution, we find three stability regimes for the
coupling constant k, separated by critical points k1 and k2: (i) for k<k1, only
the stable incoherent state exists; (ii) for k>k2, the incoherent state becomes
unstable and only the synchronized state exists; (iii) for k1<k<k2, both the
incoherent and synchronized states are stable. In the bistable regime
spontaneous transitions between the incoherent and synchronized states are
observed for finite ensembles. These transitions are well described as a
stochastic process on the order parameter r undergoing fluctuations due to the
system's finite size, leading to the following conclusions: (a) in the bistable
regime, the average waiting time of an incoherent-to-coherent transition can be
predicted by using Kramer's escape time formula and grows exponentially with
the number of oscillators; (b) when the incoherent state is unstable (k>k2),
the average waiting time grows logarithmically with the number of oscillators.

some problems they are applicable only with difficulty. A case in point is that
of estimating the distributions of eigenvalue estimators, or of functions of
those estimators, when one or more of the true eigenvalues are tied. The
$m$-out-of-$n$ bootstrap can be used to deal with problems of this general
type, but it is very sensitive to the choice of $m$. In this paper we propose a
new approach, where a tie diagnostic is used to determine the locations of
ties, and parameter estimates are adjusted accordingly. Our tie diagnostic is
governed by a probability level, $\beta$, which in principle is an analogue of
$m$ in the $m$-out-of-$n$ bootstrap. However, the tie-respecting bootstrap
(TRB) is remarkably robust against the choice of $\beta$. This makes the TRB
significantly more attractive than the $m$-out-of-$n$ bootstrap, where the
value of $m$ has substantial influence on the final result. The TRB can be used
very generally; for example, to test hypotheses about, or construct confidence
regions for, the proportion of variability explained by a set of principal
components. It is suitable for both finite-dimensional data and functional
data.

dynamics of correlated electrons in quantum transport through nanoscale systems
contacted to metallic leads. This approach is based on the time-propagation of
the Kadanoff-Baym equations for the nonequilibrium many-body Green's function
of open and interacting systems out of equilibrium. An important feature of the
method is that it takes full account of electronic correlations and embedding
effects in the presence of time-dependent external fields, while at the same
time satisfying the charge conservation law. The method further extends the
Meir-Wingreen formula to the time domain for initially correlated states. We
study the electron dynamics of a correlated quantum wire attached to
two-dimensional leads exposed to a sudden switch-on of a bias voltage using
conserving many-body approximations at Hartree-Fock, second Born and GW level.
We obtain detailed results for the transient currents, dipole moments, spectral
functions, charging times, and the many-body screening of the quantum wire as
well as for the time-dependent density pattern in the leads, and we show how
the time-dependence of these observables provides a wealth of information on
the level structure of the quantum wire out of equilibrium. For moderate
interaction strenghts the 2B and GW results are in excellent agreement at all
times. We find that many-body effects beyond the Hartree-Fock approximation
have a large effect on the qualitative behavior of the system and lead to a
bias dependent gap closing and quasiparticle broadening, shortening of the
transient times and washing out of the step features in the current-voltage
curves.

model at half filling and superfluidity of s-wave pairs in the attractive case
away from half filling using determinantal quantum Monte Carlo simulations that
are free of the fermion sign problem. We find that an entropy per particle
~log(2) is sufficient to observe the charge gap in the repulsive Hubbard model
or the pairing pseudogap in the attractive case. Observing antiferromagnetic
correlations or superfluidity in 2D systems requires a further reduction in
entropy by a factor of three or more. In contrast to higher dimensions, we find
that adiabatic cooling is not useful to achieve the required low temperatures.
