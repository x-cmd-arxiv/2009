continuous injection of relativistic electrons with a power-law energy
distribution above some typical injection energy. We find that the

analytic estimates for the break frequencies and power-law indices. In general,
we show that the dependence of the KN cross-section on the energy of the

the typical injection energy, can be as hard as $F_\nu \propto \nu^0$, instead
of the classical $\nu^{-1/2}$ when KN effects are neglected. The synchrotron

are the the precursors to stellar clusters in an early phase of fragmentation.
Young stars are distributed in the vicinity of the IRDCs, but the clumps are
typically not associated with stars and appear pre-stellar in nature. We find
an IRDC clump mass spectrum with a slope of 1.76 +/- 0.05 for masses from 30 to

variety of observational techniques, of massive star formation regions and is
close to the mass function of Galactic stellar clusters and star clusters in
other galaxies. We assert that the shape of the mass function is an intrinsic
and universal feature of massive star formation regions, that are the birth
sites of stellar clusters. As these clouds evolve and their constituent clumps
fragment, the mass spectrum will steepen and eventually assume the form of the

considerable strain sensitivity of polarization and a low electric permittivity

constructing the partition function. We then use our partition function to
compute thermodynamic quantities such as the free energy and the specific heat.
In this approach, the parameters of the word frequency model vary from word to
word so that each word has a different corresponding thermodynamics and we
suggest that differences in the specific heat reflect differences in how the
words are used in language, differentiating keywords from common and function
words. Finally, we apply our thermodynamic picture to the problem of retrieval
of texts based on keywords and suggest some advantages over traditional
information retrieval methods.

and III induce radiatively in the soft massive parameters of the minimal
supersymmetric SU(5) model, made realistic by nonrenormalizable operators, are
analyzed. Effective couplings are used to parametrize the couplings of
renormalizable operators and of the corrections that nonrenormalizable ones
provide at the tree level. It is found that for a limited, but sufficient
accuracy in the calculations of such violations, it is possible to extend the
picture of effective couplings to the quantum level, all the way to the cutoff
scale. The arbitrariness introduced by nonrenormalizable operators is analyzed
in detail. It is shown that it can be drastically reduced in the Yukawa sector
if the effective Yukawa couplings involving colored triplet Higgs bosons are
tuned to suppress the decay rate of the proton. In the supersymmetry-breaking
sector, the usual requirement of independence of flavour and field type for the
mechanism of mediation of supersymmetry breaking is not sufficient to forbid
arbitrary flavour and CP violations at the tree level. Special conditions to be
added to this requirement, under which such violations can be avoided, are
identified. Depending on how and whether these conditions are implemented,
different phenomenological scenarios emerge. Flavour and CP violations of soft
massive parameters induced by neutrino-seesaw couplings are discussed
explicitly for the simplest scenario, in which no such violations are present
at the tree level. Guidelines for studying them in other, less simple scenarios
are given. Lists of all renormalization group equations needed for their
calculations are provided for each of the three types of seesaw mechanism, at
all energies between the TeV scale and Planck scale.

region between 10 and 100 GeV may well be a natural consequence of the standard
scenario for the origin of Galactic cosmic rays. The 'excess' arises because of
positrons created as secondary products of hadronic interactions inside the
sources, but the crucial physical ingredient which leads to a natural
explanation of the positron flux is the fact that the secondary production
takes place in the same region where cosmic rays are being accelerated.
Therefore secondary positrons (and electrons) participate in the acceleration
process and turn out to have a very flat spectrum, which is responsible, after
propagation in the Galaxy, for the observed positron 'excess'. This effect
cannot be avoided though its strength depends on the values of the
environmental parameters during the late stages of evolution of supernova
remnants.

variability in a vast range of timescales: from annual to multi-millennium.
Unlike linear systems, where periodic forcing leads to periodic response,
nonlinear chaotic response to periodic forcing can result in exponentially
decaying broad-band power spectrum with decay rate T_e equal to the period of
the forcing. It is shown that power spectrum of a reconstructed time series of
Northern Hemisphere temperature anomaly for the past 2,000 years has an
exponentially decaying broad-band part with T_e = 11 yr, i.e. the observed
decay rate T_e equals the mean period of the solar activity. It is also shown
that power spectrum of a reconstruction of atmospheric CO_2 time fluctuations
for the past 650,000 years, has an exponentially decaying broad-band part with
T_e = 41,000 years, i.e. the observed decay rate T_e equals the period of the
obliquity periodic forcing. A possibility of a chaotic solar forcing of the
climate has been also discussed. These results clarify role of solar forcing
variability in long-term global climate dynamics (in particular in the unsolved

a blackbody function, with $T=1285\pm50 $K, which dominates the nuclear

attribute the blackbody component to emission by a dusty structure, with hot

by our observations, which provide only an upper limit for its distance from
the nucleus of 4 pc. If the reddening derived for the narrow-line region also

it has a non-negligible tail at low redshifts, when the bulk of the kSZ
peculiar momentum of the halo (cluster + group) population arises. If gas
outside halos is comoving with clusters as the theory predicts, then the
signature of the bulk flows of the missing baryons should be recovered by a
cross-correlation analysis of future CMB data sets with kSZ estimates in
clusters of galaxies. For an ACT or SPT type of CMB experiment, all sky kSZ
estimates of all clusters above $2\times 10^{14} h^{-1}M_{\odot}$ should
provide a detection of {\it dark} flows with signal to noise ratio (S/N) of

is an agglomeration of cell organelles of a similar size. Using Mie theory
computer simulations for a dielectric sphere with biological nucleus-like

scattering contribution, while multiple scattering events give slowly varying
oscillatory contributions. With increasing contrast, the backscattering signal
changes from a pure sinusoid to that of a beat signal. The beat-like pattern in

increasing with decreasing redshift, although much of the gas has a cooling
time shorter than the Hubble time. The gas is being heated and kept hot by
gravitational heating processes through the release of potential energy from
infalling stellar clumps. The energy is dissipated in supersonic collisions of
infalling gas lumps with the ambient gas and through the dynamical capturing of
satellite systems causing gravitational wakes that transfer energy to the
surrounding gas. Furthermore dynamical friction from the infalling clumps
pushes out dark matter, lowering the central dark matter density by up to a
factor of two from z=3 to z=0. In galaxies in which the late formation history
(z<2) is dominated by minor merging and accretion the energy released
(E~5x10^{59} ergs) from gravitational feedback is sufficient to form red and

metallicity gradients, we study the evolution of non-dissipative (""dry"") equal
mass mergers. Our purpose in generating these simulations is to explore how the
metallicity gradient in dry mergers depends on the structure and metallicity
gradients of the galaxies involved in the merger. Specifically, we would like
to answer: Could dry mergers lead to metallicity gradients as observed in
elliptical galaxies in the local Universe? Do dry mergers always lead to a
flattening of the initial (i.e., pre-merger) gradient? From this modeling, we
conclude that: The ratio of the remnant and the initial galaxy slopes span a
wide range of values, up to values greater than 1 (with values greater than one
resulting only when companions have gradients twice the progenitor). For a
merger between two ellipticals having identical initial metallicity slopes
(i.e., equal companion and galaxy slopes), the metallicity profile of the
remnant flattens, with a final gradient about 0.6 times the initial one.
Ellipticals can maintain their original pre-merger metallicity gradient if the
companion slope is sufficiently steep. The amount of flattening neither depends
on the characteristics of the orbit of the progenitors or on their initial
concentration. Given the diversity in outcomes of the mergers, we conclude that
dry mergers do not violate any observational constraints on the systematic
characteristics of metallicity gradients in local ellipticals. In fact, dry
mergers may be important within the context of the results of our simulations
and may explain the large scatter in gradients for massive ellipticals and the
relative paucity of massive ellipticals with no or shallow metallicity
gradients.

typically show more peculiarities in their stellar population than more
metal-rich clusters of the same mass do. Thus the cluster v_esc can be used as
parameter to describe the degree of self-enrichment. The nGCs populate the same
Mv vs. rh region as EHB-GCs, although they do not reach the sizes of the
largest EHB-GCs like wCen and NGC 2419. We argue that during accretion the rh
of an nGC could increase due to significant mass loss in the cluster vicinity
and the resulting drop in the external potential in the core once the dwarf
galaxy dissolves. Our results support the scenario in which Galactic EHB-GCs
have originated in the centres of pre-Galactic building blocks or dwarf
galaxies that were later accreted by the Milky Way.

compact galaxies (BCGs), by fitting their 2D light distributions. Their
structural parameters were related with galaxy properties such as colours and
gas content. These properties were also compared with those of other galaxy
types. All the BCG hosts but one show low Sersic indexes (0.5 < n < 2), with
mean effective radius <$r_{e,B}$>=1.11$\pm$0.74 kpc, and mean surface
brightness <$\mu_{e,B}$> = 22.59$\pm$0.68 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. Host effective
radii scale linearly with their luminosity, while n and $\mu_{\rm e}$ do not.
In addition, host colours and structural parameters are not linearly
correlated. Overall,the flux enhancement caused by the starburst is about 0.8
mag while their B-R colours decrease by about 0.2 mag. Galaxies with more
luminous and extended hosts show larger and luminous starburst components. BCG
hosts show B-R=0.95$\pm$0.26 in median. Overall, BCG hosts are more compact (by
a factor ~2) and have higher central surface brightnesses (by about ~2 mag)
than dIs and most dEs. BCG hosts and dIs are indistinguishable in the B-band
Tully-Fisher relation (TFR). We found that about 50-60 % of the galaxies are
more underluminous than those late-type discs with the same circular velocity.
This feature is more important when luminosities are converted into stellar
masses, while it tends to diminish when the HI gas mass is added. Deviations
among host masses for a given circular velocity from the stellar TFR correlate
with their HI mass-to-luminosity ratio, whereas deviations from the gas+stellar
TFR, do not. Overall, our findings suggest that the baryonic mass in BCGs tends
to normal values but BCGs tend to be inefficient producing stars, especially
toward the low-mass, gas-rich and bluest hosts, in a similar way to dIs.

which was originally introduced by L'vov and Procaccia in the context of the

in understanding the enstrophy cascade and inverse energy cascade of
two-dimensional turbulence. In the present paper we show that the fusion rules
hypothesis, combined with \emph{non-perturbative locality}, itself a
consequence of the fusion rules hypothesis, dictates the location of the
boundary separating the inertial range from the dissipation range. In so doing,
the hypothesis that there may be an anomalous enstrophy sink at small scales
and an anomalous energy sink at large scales emerges as a consequence of the
fusion rules hypothesis. More broadly, we illustrate the significance of
viewing inertial ranges as multi-dimensional regions where the fully unfused
generalized structure functions of the velocity field are self-similar, by
considering, in this paper, the simplified projection of such regions in a
two-dimensional space, involving a small scale $r$ and a large scale $R$, which
we call, in this paper, the $(r, R)$-plane. We see, for example, that the
logarithmic correction in the enstrophy cascade, under standard molecular
dissipation, plays an essential role in inflating the inertial range in the
$(r, R)$ plane to ensure the possibility of local interactions. We have also
seen that increasingly higher orders of hyperdiffusion at large scales or
hypodiffusion at small scales make the predicted sink anomalies more resilient
to possible violations of the fusion rules hypothesis.

transition visible in ac-susceptibility shifts down under pressure and the
resistive anomaly typical for a spin density wave (SDW) antiferromagnetic
transition develops near the susceptibility anomaly. Tc determined by the
appearance of a diamagnetic response in susceptibility, increases linearly
under pressure at a rate dTc/dP = 3.5 K/GPa. Below 1.5 GPa, the resistive
superconducting transition is sharp; the width of transition does not change
with pressure; and, Tc determined by a peak in drho/dT increases at a rate ~
3.5 K/GPa. At higher pressure, a giant broadening of the resistive transition
develops. This effect cannot be explained by possible pressure gradients in the

signature for a second peak above 3 GPa which is indicative of the appearance
of another superconducting state in alpha-FeSe at high pressure. We argue that
this second superconducting phase coexists with SDW antiferromagnetism in a

accurate mass models for the Fornax dwarf, obtained through Jeans modelling of
the recently published line of sight velocity dispersion data, and we are also
not resigned to circular orbits for the globular clusters. Previously conceived
problems stem from fixing the starting distances of the globulars to be less
than half the tidal radius. We relax this constraint since there is absolutely
no evidence for it and show that the dark matter paradigm, with either cusped
or cored dark matter profiles, has no trouble sustaining the orbits of the two
least massive globular clusters for a Hubble time almost regardless of their
initial distance from Fornax. The three most massive globulars can remain in
orbit as long as their starting distances are marginally outside the tidal
radius. The outlook for modified Newtonian dynamics is also not nearly as bleak
as previously reported. Although dynamical friction inside the tidal radius is
far stronger in MOND, outside dynamical friction is negligible due to the
absence of stars. This allows highly radial orbits to survive, but more
importantly circular orbits at distances more than 85% of Fornax's tidal radius
to survive indefinitely. The probability of the globular clusters being on
circular orbits at this distance compared with their current projected
distances is discussed and shown to be plausible. Finally, if we ignore the
presence of the most massive globular (giving it a large line of sight
distance) we demonstrate that the remaining four globulars can survive within
the tidal radius for the Hubble time with perfectly sensible orbits.

the phases where the electric field passes through zero and the Lorentz factors
of all particles have their maxima. The emissivity is derived for an individual
particle and is integrated over frequency and solid angle to find the power
radiated per particle. The result is different from that implied by the
generalized Larmor formula which, we argue, is not valid in this case. We also
discuss a mathematical inconsistency that arises when one evaluates the power
spectrum by integrating the emissivity over solid angle. The correct power
spectrum increases as the 4/3rd power of the frequency at low frequencies, and
falls off exponentially above a characteristic frequency.

lepton mixing matrices with different basis matrices. We start with a general
discussion on the triminimal expansion of the mixing matrix and on possible
unified quark and lepton parametrization using quark-lepton complementarity
(QLC). We then consider several interesting basis matrices and compare the
triminimal parametrizations with the Wolfenstein-like parametrizations. The
usual Wolfenstein parametrization for quark mixing is a triminimal expansion
around the unit matrix as the basis. The corresponding QLC lepton mixing matrix
is a triminimal expansion around the bimaximal basis. Current neutrino
oscillation data show that the lepton mixing matrix is very well represented by
the tri-bimaximal mixing. It is natural to take it as an expanding basis. The
corresponding zeroth order basis for quark mixing in this case makes the
triminimal expansion converge much faster than the usual Wolfenstein
parametrization. The triminimal expansion based on tri-bimaximal mixing can be
converted to the Wolfenstein-like parametrizations discussed in the literature.
We thus have a unified description between different kinds of parametrizations
for quark and lepton sectors: the standard parametrizations, the
Wolfenstein-like parametrizations, and the triminimal parametrizations.

non-magnetic organic charge transfer salts, and that these similarities can be
understood in terms of spin fluctuations. Further, we show that, in all of the
kappa-phase organic superconductors for which there is nuclear magnetic
resonance data, the energy scale for the spin fluctuations coincides with the
energy scale for the pseudogap. This suggests that the pseudogap is caused by
short-range spin correlations. In the weakly frustrated metals
k-(BEDT-TTF)_2Cu[N(CN)_2]Br, k-(BEDT-TTF)_2Cu(NCS)_2, and
k-(BEDT-TTF)_2Cu[N(CN)_2]Cl (under pressure) the pseudogap opens at the same
temperature as coherence emerges in the (intralayer) transport. We argue that
this is because the spin correlations are cut off by the loss of intralayer
coherence at high temperatures. We discuss what might happen to these two
energy scales at high pressures, where the electronic correlations are weaker.
In these weakly frustrated materials the data is well described by the chemical
pressure hypothesis (that anion substitution is equivalent to hydrostatic
pressure). However, we find important differences in the metallic state of
k-(BEDT-TTF)_2Cu_2(CN)_3, which is highly frustrated and displays a spin liquid
insulating phase. We also show that the characteristic temperature scale of the
spin fluctuations in (TMTSF)_2ClO_4 is the same as superconducting critical
temperature, which may be evidence that spin fluctuations mediate the
superconductivity in the Bechgaard salts.

explain magnetic reconnection of all scales) and the interchange between small

name a few, can be easily captured by the concept of intermittency. This study
is focused on simultaneous time variations of intermittency properties derived
in the photosphere, chromosphere and corona. We analyzed data for NOAA AR 10930
acquired between Dec 08, 2006 12:00 UT and Dec 13, 2006 18:45 UT. Photospheric
intermittency was inferred from Hinode magnetic field measurements, while
intermittency in the transition region and corona was derived from Nobeyama 9
GHz radio polarization measurements, high cadence Hinode/XRT/Be-thin data as
well as GOES 1-8\AA flux. Photospheric dynamics and its possible relationship
with the intermittency variations were also analyzed by calculating the kinetic
vorticity. For this case study we found the following chain of events.
Intermittency of the photospheric magnetic field peaked after the specific
kinetic vorticity of plasma flows in the AR reached its maximum level (4 hour
time delay). In turn, gradual increase of coronal intermittency occurred after
the peak of the photospheric intermittency. The time delay between the peak of
photospheric intermittency and the occurrence of the first strong (X3.4) flare
was approximately 1.3 days. Our analysis seems to suggest that the enhancement
of intermittency/complexity first occurs in the photosphere and is later
transported toward the corona.

result for order-preserving, strongly sublinear RDS, we establish the
asymptotic properties of the RARE: the sequence of random prediction error
covariance matrices converges weakly to a unique invariant distribution, whose

under broad conditions and even when the observations arrival rate is below the
critical probability for mean stability. We apply the weak-Feller property of

important for one party to be able to judge objectively the trustworthiness of
the other. In such a setting, the decision to trust a user may sensibly be
based on that user's past behaviour. We introduce a specification language
based on linear temporal logic for expressing a policy for categorising the
behaviour patterns of a user depending on its transaction history. We also
present an algorithm for checking whether the transaction history obeys the
stated policy. To be useful in a real setting, such a language should allow one
to express realistic policies which may involve parameter quantification and
quantitative or statistical patterns. We introduce several extensions of linear
temporal logic to cater for such needs: a restricted form of universal and
existential quantification; arbitrary computable functions and relations in the
term language; and a ""counting"" quantifier for counting how many times a
formula holds in the past. We then show that model checking a transaction
history against a policy, which we call the history-based transaction
monitoring problem, is PSPACE-complete in the size of the policy formula and
the length of the history. The problem becomes decidable in polynomial time
when the policies are fixed. We also consider the problem of transaction
monitoring in the case where not all the parameters of actions are observable.
We formulate two such ""partial observability"" monitoring problems, and show
their decidability under certain restrictions.

eccentricities of stars deposited near (<0.05 pc) the Milky Way massive black
hole (MBH), starting from initial conditions motivated by two competing models
for their origin: formation in a disk followed by inward migration; and
exchange interactions involving a binary star. The first model predicts modest
eccentricities, lower than those observed in the S-star cluster, while the
second model predicts higher eccentricities than observed. The N-body
simulations include a dense cluster of 10 M_sun stellar black holes (SBHs),
expected to accumulate near the MBH by mass segregation. Perturbations from the
SBHs tend to randomize the stellar orbits, partially erasing the dynamical
signatures of their origin. The eccentricities of the initially highly
eccentric stars evolve, in 20 Myr (the S-star lifespan), to a distribution that
is consistent at the ~95 % level with the observed eccentricity distribution.
In contrast, the eccentricities of the initially more circular orbits fail to
evolve to the observed values in 20 Myr, arguing against the disk migration
scenario. We find that 20 % - 30 % of the S-stars are tidally disrupted by the
MBH over their lifetimes, and that the S-stars are not likely to be ejected as
hypervelocity stars outside the central 0.05 pc by close encounters with
stellar black holes.

properties of a 4-dimensional, self-dual Dirac-Yang-Mills operator $\D$ can be

that a similar result holds for higher spins, and that in the 4-vector case the

early-type galaxies in A2218 at z $\simeq$ 0.175. Mid-infrared (MIR) emission
from early-type galaxies traces circumstellar dust emission from AGB stars
or/and residual star formation. Including the unique imaging capability at 11
and 15 $\mu$m, our {\it AKARI} data provide an effective way to investigate MIR
properties of early-type galaxies in the cluster environment. Among our
flux-limited sample of 22 red sequence early-type galaxies with precise
dynamical and line strength measurements ($<$ 18 mag at 3 $\mu m$), we find
that at least 41% have MIR-excess emission. The $N3-S11$ versus $N3$ (3 and 11
$\mu$m) color-magnitude relation shows the expected blue sequence, but the
MIR-excess galaxies add a red wing to the relation especially at the fainter
end. A SED analysis reveals that the dust emission from AGB stars is the most
likely cause for the MIR-excess, with low level of star formation being the
next possible explanation. The MIR-excess galaxies show a wide spread of
$N3-S11$ colors, implying a significant spread (2--11 Gyr) in the estimated
mean ages of stellar populations. We study the environmental dependence of
MIR-excess early-type galaxies over an area out to a half virial radius
($\sim$1 Mpc). We find that the MIR-excess early-type galaxies are
preferentially located in the outer region. From these evidences, we suggest
that the fainter, MIR-excess early-type galaxies have just joined the red
sequence, possibly due to the infall and subsequent morphological/spectral
transformation induced by the cluster environment.

lines of circular polarization in three dimensional optical ellipse fields are
shown to be organized into Mobius strips. These strips can have either one or
three half-twists, and can be either right- or left-handed. The normals to the
surrounding ellipses generate cone-like structures. Two special projections,
one new geometrical, and seven new topological indices are developed to
characterize the rather complex structures of the Mobius strips and cones.
These eight indices, together with the two well-known indices used until now to
characterize singular lines of circular polarization, could, if independent,
generate 16,384 geometrically and topologically distinct lines. Geometric
constraints and 13 selection rules are discussed that reduce the number of
lines to 2,104, some 1,150 of which have been observed in practice; this number
of different C lines is ~ 350 times greater than the three types of lines

the loss of analyticity of the magnetic susceptibility and its extreme

ground state through photoassociation into the B1Pi state, which has recently
been reported [J. Deiglmayr et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 133004 (2008)].
Absolute rate constants for photoassociation at large detunings from the atomic
asymptote are determined and are found to be surprisingly large. The
photoassociation process is modeled using a full coupled-channel calculation
for the continuum state, taking all relevant hyperfine states into account. The
enhancement of the photoassociation rate is found to be caused by an `echo' of
the triplet component in the singlet component of the scattering wave function
at the inner turning point of the lowest triplet a3Sigma+ potential. This
perturbation can be ascribed to the existence of a broad Feshbach resonance at
low scattering energies. Our results elucidate the important role of couplings
in the scattering wave function for the formation of deeply bound ground state
molecules via photoassociation.

two-body breakup channel was unambiguously identified by the (nonsimultaneous)
detection of both protons and deuterons. This approach was made feasible by the
over-determined kinematic situation afforded by the tagged-photon technique.
Proton- and deuteron-energy spectra were measured using four silicon
surface-barrier detector telescopes located at a laboratory angle of 90deg with
respect to the incident photon-beam direction. Average statistical and
systematic uncertainties of 5.7% and 6.6% in the differential cross section
were obtained for 11 photon-energy bins with an average width of 1.2 MeV. The
results are compared to previous experimental data measured at comparable
photon energies as well as to the results of two recent Faddeev calculations
which employ realistic potential models and take into account three-nucleon

make this object a unique target for the study of particle acceleration in a
supernova shock. To describe the radio synchrotron emission we use a model that
couples a semianalytic description of nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration
with self-similar solutions for the hydrodynamics of the supernova expansion.
The synchrotron emission, which is assumed to be produced by relativistic
electrons propagating in the postshock plasma, is worked out from radiative
transfer calculations that include the process of synchrotron self-absorption.
The model is applied to explain the morphology of the radio emission deduced
from high-resolution VLBI imaging observations and the measured time evolution
of the total flux density at six frequencies. Both the light curves and the
morphology of the radio emission indicate that the magnetic field was strongly
amplified in the blast wave region shortly after the explosion, possibly via
the nonresonant regime of the cosmic-ray streaming instability operating in the
shock precursor. The turbulent magnetic field was not damped behind the shock
but carried along by the plasma flow in the downstream region. Cosmic-ray
protons were efficiently produced by diffusive shock acceleration at the blast
wave. We find that during the first ~8.5 years after the explosion, about 19%
of the total energy processed by the forward shock was converted to cosmic-ray
energy. However, the shock remained weakly modified by the cosmic-ray pressure.
The high magnetic field amplification implies that protons were rapidly
accelerated to energies well above 1 PeV. The results obtained for this
supernova support the scenario that massive stars exploding into their former
stellar wind are a major source of high-energy Galactic cosmic rays.

hole wavefunctions analytically. The envelope function approximation was
considered to obtain these wavefunctions for a special basis set. While
adjacent valence subbands have been studied exactly, the conduction bands are
approximated as parabolic. The effect of Stokes shift has been also taken into
account. The dipole moment matrix elements for interband atomic transitions are
evaluated via correlation between electron and hole envelope functions, for
both orthogonal polarizations. This has simplified the calculation of
photoluminescence intensity. Spatial variations in hole/electron wavefunctions
have been examined with the introduction of piezoelectric and spontaneous

representative of the XRF class and exhibits an X-ray shallow decay. The rich

proposed to explain both the softness of XRFs and the shallow decay phase. We

which seems to integrate the sexual and clonal processes in one system. In a
case of frogs, described in the paper, two parental species - Rana lessonae and
Rana ridibunda can form fertile hybrid individuals - Rana esculenta. Hybrid
individuals eliminate one parental haplotype from their germ line cells before
meiosis (end before recombination) which implicates clonal reproduction of the
haplotype transferred to the gametes. All three ""species"" are called ""complex
species"". To study the evolution of genomes in the hybridogenetic fraction of
this complex species we have used the Monte Carlo based model rendering the age
structured populations. The model enables the analysis of distribution of
defective alleles in the individual genomes as well as in the genetic pool of
the whole populations.
  Results: We have shown that longer isolation of hybrids' populations leads to
the speciation through emerging the specific sets of complementing haplotypes
in their genetic pool. The fraction of defective alleles increases but the
defects are complemented in the heterozygous loci. Nevertheless, even small
supply of new hybrids generated by the two parental species or crossbreeding
between hybrids and one of the parental species prevents the speciation and
changes the strategy of the genome evolution from the complementing to the
purifying Darwinian selection.

the main performance index. In these networks users are free to choose their
power control strategy to selfishly maximize their energy-efficiency.
Specifically, we introduce hierarchy in two different ways: 1. Assuming
single-user decoding at the receiver, we investigate a Stackelberg formulation
of the game where one user is the leader whereas the other users are assumed to
be able to react to the leader's decisions; 2. Assuming neither leader nor
followers among the users, we introduce hierarchy by assuming successive
interference cancellation at the receiver. It is shown that introducing a
certain degree of hierarchy in non-cooperative power control games not only
improves the individual energy efficiency of all the users but can also be a
way of insuring the existence of a non-saturated equilibrium and reaching a
desired trade-off between the global network performance at the equilibrium and
the requested amount of signaling. In this respect, the way of measuring the
global performance of an energy-efficient network is shown to be a critical
issue.

discussing the coupled sine-Gordon equations for the gauge-invariant phase

In close analogy to nonlinear optics, these waves exhibit numerous remarkable

a stronger one. We also present quantum effects in layered superconductors,
specifically, the problem of quantum tunnelling of fluxons through stacks of

the problem of coherent radiation (superradiance) of the THz waves by exciting
uniform Josephson oscillations. The effects reviewed here could be potentially
useful for sub-THz and THz emitters, filters, and detectors.

with a pair (A,B) of two regular multiplier Hopf algebras. We assume that B is
a right A-module algebra and that A is a left B-comodule coalgebra. We recall
and discuss the two notions in the first sections of the paper. The right
action of A on B gives rise to the smash product A # B. The left coaction of B
on A gives a possible coproduct on A # B. We will discuss in detail the
necessary compatibility conditions between the action and the coaction for this
to be a proper coproduct on A # B. The result is again a regular multiplier
Hopf algebra. Majid's construction is obtained when we have Hopf algebras.
  We also look at the dual case, constructed from a pair (C,D) of regular
multiplier Hopf algebras where now C is a left D-module algebra while D is a
right C-comodule coalgebra. We will show that indeed, these two constructions
are dual to each other in the sense that a natural pairing of A with C and of B
with D will yield a duality between A # B and the smash product C # D.
  We show that the bicrossproduct of algebraic quantum groups is again an
algebraic quantum group (i.e. a regular multiplier Hopf algebra with
integrals). The *-algebra case will also be considered. Some special cases will
be treated and they will be related with other constructions available in the
literature.

with two subgroups H and K such that G=KH and the intersection of H and K is
trivial will be used throughout the paper for motivation and illustration of
the different notions and results. The cases where either H or K is a normal

analyzed due to suppressed mixing between different modes in the small fields

exponentially, but the scalar and tensor modes could remain weakly coupled

significant correlations of the scalar and tensor modes in the CMB. For the

(ii) the study of the history of stellar populations. Methods. We developed
ULySS, a package to fit spectroscopic observations against a linear combination
of non-linear model components convolved with a parametric line-of-sight
velocity distribution. The minimization can be either local or global, and
determines all the parameters in a single fit. We use chi2 maps, convergence
maps and Monte-Carlo simulations to study the degeneracies, local minima and to
estimate the errors. Results. We show the importance of determining the shape
of the continuum simultaneously to the other parameters by including a
multiplicative polynomial in the model (without prior pseudo-continuum
determination, or rectification of the spectrum). We also stress the benefice
of using an accurate line-spread function, depending on the wavelength, so that
the line-shape of the models properly match the observation. For simple models,
i. e., to measure the atmospheric parameters or the age/metallicity of a
single-age stellar population, there is often a unique minimum, or when local
minima exist they can unambiguously be recognized. For more complex models,
Monte-Carlo simulations are required to assess the validity of the solution.
Conclusions. The ULySS package is public, simple to use and flexible. The full
spectrum fitting makes optimal usage of the signal.

efficient close to critical states associated with phase transitions. It is
therefore conceivable that also neural information processing operates close to
criticality. This is further supported by the observation of power-law
distributions, which are a hallmark of phase transitions. An important open
question is how neural networks could remain close to a critical point while
undergoing a continual change in the course of development, adaptation,
learning, and more. An influential contribution was made by Bornholdt and
Rohlf, introducing a generic mechanism of robust self-organized criticality in
adaptive networks. Here, we address the question whether this mechanism is
relevant for real neural networks. We show in a realistic model that
spike-time-dependent synaptic plasticity can self-organize neural networks
robustly toward criticality. Our model reproduces several empirical
observations and makes testable predictions on the distribution of synaptic
strength, relating them to the critical state of the network. These results
suggest that the interplay between dynamics and topology may be essential for
neural information processing.

one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates in position and momentum space. We
particularly focus on the region where non-linearity and disorder
simultaneously effect the time propagation of the condensate as well as the
possible interference between various parts of the matter wave. We report
oscillation between spatially extended and localized behavior for the
propagating condensate which dies down with increasing non-linearity. We also
report intriguing behavior of the phase fluctuation and the coherence
properties of the matter wave. We also briefly compare these behavior with that
of a two-dimensional condensate. We mention the relevance of our results to the
related experiments on Anderson localization and indicate the possibility of
future experiments
