$k$-wise, independence with sublinear memory is of considerable importance. In
the streaming model the joint distribution is given by a stream of $k$-tuples,
with the goal of testing correlations among the components measured over the
entire stream. In the streaming model, Indyk and McGregor (SODA 08) recently
gave exciting new results for measuring pairwise independence. The Indyk and
McGregor methods provide $\log{n}$-approximation under statistical distance
between the joint and product distributions in the streaming model. Indyk and
McGregor leave, as their main open question, the problem of improving their
$\log n$-approximation for the statistical distance metric.
  In this paper we solve the main open problem posed by of Indyk and McGregor
for the statistical distance for pairwise independence and extend this result
to any constant $k$. In particular, we present an algorithm that computes an
$(\epsilon, \delta)$-approximation of the statistical distance between the
joint and product distributions defined by a stream of $k$-tuples. Our
algorithm requires $O(({1\over \epsilon}\log({nm\over \delta}))^{(30+k)^k})$
memory and a single pass over the data stream.

  (supervisor: Damien Roy)",,,,"math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the problem of simultaneous approximation to a fixed family of real
and p-adic numbers by roots of integer polynomials of restricted type. The
method that we use for this purpose was developed by H. Davenport and W.M.
Schmidt in their study of approximation to real numbers by algebraic integers.
This method based on Mahler's Duality requires to study the dual problem of
approximation to successive powers of these numbers by rational numbers with
the same denominators. Dirichlet's Box Principle provides estimates for such
approximations but one can do better. In this thesis we establish constraints
on how much better one can do when dealing with the numbers and their squares.
We also construct examples showing that at least in some instances these
constraints are optimal. Going back to the original problem, we obtain
estimates for simultaneous approximation to real and p-adic numbers by roots of
integer polynomials of degree 3 or 4 with fixed coefficients in degree at least
3. In the case of a single real number (and no p-adic numbers), we extend work
of D. Roy by showing that the square of the golden ratio is the optimal
exponent of approximation by algebraic numbers of degree 4 with bounded
denominator and trace.

that the splitting is due to a change of crystal structure near the surface.
The agreement between calculation and experiment is enhanced by including the

lead to a splitting of the bands. The dispersion of the highly nested small

close to the STA such that the STA can associate with the AP at a high physical
rate. We develop a scalable cell level model for such WLANs with saturated AP
and STA queues as well as for TCP-controlled long file downloads. The accuracy
of our model is demonstrated by comparison with ns-2 simulations. We also
demonstrate how our analytical model could be applied in conjunction with a
Learning Automata (LA) algorithm for optimal channel assignment. Based on the
insights provided by our analytical model, we propose a simple decentralized
algorithm which provides static channel assignments that are Nash equilibria in
pure strategies for the objective of maximizing normalized network throughput.
Our channel assignment algorithm requires neither any explicit knowledge of the
topology nor any message passing, and provides assignments in only as many
steps as there are channels. In contrast to prior work, our approach to channel
assignment is based on the throughput metric.

antipartners, collect inside the first stars and annihilate to produce a heat
source that can power the stars. A new stellar phase results, a Dark Star,
powered by dark matter annihilation as long as there is dark matter fuel, with
lifetimes from millions to billions of years. We find that the first stars are
very bright ($\sim 10^6 L_\odot$) and cool ($T_{surf} < 10,000$K) during the DS
phase, and grow to be very massive (500-1000 times as massive as the Sun).
These results differ markedly from the standard picture in the absence of DM
heating, in which the maximum mass is about 140$M_\odot$ and the temperatures
are much hotter ($T_{surf} > 50,000$K); hence DS should be observationally
distinct from standard Pop III stars. Once the dark matter fuel is exhausted,
the DS becomes a heavy main sequence star; these stars eventually collapse to
form massive black holes that may provide seeds for supermassive black holes
observed at early times as well as explanations for recent ARCADE data and for
intermediate black holes.

micron) > 1 microJy with accurate photometric redshifts
(sigma_((zp-zs)/(1+zs))=0.008 at i<22.5). Using a spectral classification, we
find that z~1 is an epoch of transition in the stellar mass assembly of
quiescent galaxies. Their stellar mass density increases by 1.1 dex between
z=1.5-2 and z=0.8-1 (Delta t ~2.5 Gyr), but only by 0.3 dex between z=0.8-1 and
z~0.1 (Delta t ~ 6 Gyr). Then, we add the morphological information and find
that 80-90% of the massive quiescent galaxies (log(M)~11) have an elliptical
morphology at z<0.8. Therefore, a dominant mechanism links the shutdown of star
formation and the acquisition of an elliptical morphology in massive galaxies.
Still, a significant fraction of quiescent galaxies present a Spi/Irr
morphology at low mass (40-60% at log(M)~9.5), but this fraction is smaller
than predicted by semi-analytical models using a ``halo quenching'' recipe. We
also analyze the evolution of star-forming galaxies and split them into
``intermediate activity'' and ``high activity'' galaxies. We find that the most
massive ``high activity'' galaxies end their high star formation rate phase
first. Finally, the space density of massive star-forming galaxies becomes
lower than the space density of massive elliptical galaxies at z<1. As a
consequence, the rate of ``wet mergers'' involved in the formation of the most
massive ellipticals must decline very rapidly at z<1, which could explain the
observed slow down in the assembly of these quiescent and massive sources.

quantum fluids obeys a Kolmogorov scaling law. Such a law was previously

is suggested that turbulence in all fluids is due to quantum fluid mechanical
effects. Employing a field theoretical view of the fluid flow velocity,
vorticity appears as quantum filamentary strings. This in turn leads directly
to the Kolmogorov critical indices for the case of fully developed turbulence.

plotting and cross-checking constraints from different experiments. This allows
us to explore new regions of parameter space and to relax a number of bounds
given in the literature. We look for qualitatively different results compared
to those obtained previously using the assumption that a single coupling
dominates the R-parity violating contributions to a process (SCD). By combining
results from several experiments, we identify regions in parameter space where
two or more parameters approach their maximally allowed values. In the same
vein, we show a circumstance where consistency between independent bounds on
the same combinations of trilinear coupling parameters implies mass constraints
among slepton or squark masses. Though our new bounds are in most cases weaker
than the SCD bounds, the largest deviations we find on individual parameters
are factors of two, thus indicating that a conservative, order of magnitude
bound on an individual coupling is reliably estimated by making the SCD
assumption.

equation of state and the matter content of the Universe [w(z) & \Omega_m]. Our
proposed method consists of two components: (a) tracing the Hubble relation
using HII-like starburst galaxies, as an alternative to SNIa, which can be
detected up to very large redshifts, z~4, and (b) measuring the clustering
pattern of X-ray selected AGN at a median redshift of ~1. Each component of the
method can in itself provide interesting constraints on the cosmological
parameters, especially under our anticipation that we will reduce the
corresponding random and systematic errors significantly. However, by joining
their likelihood functions we will be able to put stringent cosmological
constraints and break the known degeneracies between the dark energy equation
of state (whether it is constant or variable) and the matter content of the
universe and provide a powerful and alternative rute to measure the
contribution to the global dynamics, and the equation of state, of dark energy.
A preliminary joint analysis of X-ray selected AGN (based on a small XMM
survey) and the currently largest SNIa sample (Kowalski et al 2008), provides:
Omega_m=0.28^{+0.02}_{-0.04} and w=-1.0 +-0.1.

a $3-$brane that resides at the intersection of two $4-$branes in
six-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. This set-up has been introduced in the
context of brane world models and, higher-dimensional versions of it, in string
theory. In both six- and ten-dimensional cases, it has been shown that
four-dimensional gravity can be reproduced at the intersection, due to the
existence of a massless, localized graviton zero-mode. However, realistic
scenarios require also the Standard Model to be localized on the $3-$brane. In
this paper, we discuss under which conditions a higher-dimensional field
theory, propagating on the above geometry, can have a zero-mode sector
localized at the intersection and find that zero modes can be localized only if
masses and couplings to the background curvature satisfy certain relations. We
also consider the case when other 4-branes cut the bulk at some distance from
the intersection and argue that, in the probe brane approximation, there is no
significant effect on the localization properties at the $3-$brane. The case of
bulk fermions is particularly interesting, since the properties of the geometry
allow localization of chiral modes independently.

be used to improve any graph isomorphism algorithm. This construction
propagates new constraints from the isomorphism constraints of the input graphs

structures of $G$ and $G'$ is ""hashed"" into the weighted edges of the extended
graphs. A bijective mapping is an isomorphism of the initial graphs if and only
if it is an isomorphism of the extended graphs. As such, the construction
enables the identification of pair of vertices $i\in V$ and $i'\in V'$ that can
not be mapped by any isomorphism $h^*:V \to V'$ (e.g. if the extended edges of
$i$ and $i'$ are different). A forbidding matrix $F$, that encodes all pairs of
incompatible mappings $(i,i')$, is constructed in order to be used by a
different algorithm. Moreover, tests on numerous graph classes show that the
matrix $F$ might leave only one compatible element for each $i \in V$.

provides a new insight to some problems of genetics, in particular, generacy of
the genetic code and the structure of the PAM matrix in bioinformatics. The
2-adic distance is an ultrametric and applications of ultrametrics in
bioinformatics are not surprising. However, by using the 2-adic numbers we
match ultrametric with a number theoretic structure. In this way we find new
applications of an ultrametric which differ from known up to now in
bioinformatics.
  We obtain the following results. We show that the PAM matrix A allows the
expansion into the sum of the two matrices A=A^{(2)}+A^{(\infty)}, where the
matrix A^{(2)} is 2-adically regular (i.e. matrix elements of this matrix are
close to locally constant with respect to the discussed earlier by the authors
2-adic parametrization of the genetic code), and the matrix A^{(\infty)} is
sparse. We discuss the structure of the matrix A^{(\infty)} in relation to the
side chain properties of the corresponding amino acids.

other modulations, Bloch oscillations are rapidly damped. We explain this
behavior in terms of collective coordinates whose Hamiltonian dynamics permits
to predict a whole family of stable solutions. In order to describe also the
unstable cases, we carry out a stability analysis for Bogoliubov excitations.
Using Floquet theory, we are able to predict the unstable modes as well as
