of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) through the use of improved formulations of QCD
on the lattice (improved actions), the development of new algorithms and the
rapid increase in computing power available to lattice gauge theorists. In this
article we describe simulations of full QCD using the improved staggered quark
formalism, ``asqtad'' fermions. These simulations were carried out with two
degenerate flavors of light quarks (up and down) and with one heavier flavor,
the strange quark. Several light quark masses, down to about 3 times the
physical light quark mass, and six lattice spacings have been used. These
enable controlled continuum and chiral extrapolations of many low energy QCD
observables. We review the improved staggered formalism, emphasizing both
advantages and drawbacks. In particular, we review the procedure for removing
unwanted staggered species in the continuum limit. We then describe the asqtad
lattice ensembles created by the MILC Collaboration. All MILC lattice ensembles
are publicly available, and they have been used extensively by a number of
lattice gauge theory groups. We review physics results obtained with them, and
discuss the impact of these results on phenomenology. Topics include the heavy
quark potential, spectrum of light hadrons, quark masses, decay constant of
light and heavy-light pseudoscalar mesons, semileptonic form factors, nucleon
structure, scattering lengths and more. We conclude with a brief look at highly
promising future prospects.

potentially attractive phenomenological scenario. The low energy
characteristics of F-theory GUTs consist of a deformation away from a minimal
gauge mediation scenario with a high messenger scale. The soft scalar masses of
the theory are all shifted by a stringy effect which survives to low energies.
This effect can range from 0 GeV up to ~ 500 GeV. In this paper we study
potential collider signatures of F-theory GUTs, focussing in particular on ways
to distinguish this class of models from other theories with an MSSM spectrum.
To accomplish this, we have adapted the general footprint method developed
recently for distinguishing broad classes of string vacua to the specific case
of F-theory GUTs. We show that with only 5 fb^(-1) of simulated LHC data, it is
possible to distinguish many mSUGRA models and low messenger scale gauge
mediation models from F-theory GUTs. Moreover, we find that at 5 fb^(-1), the
stringy deformation away from minimal gauge mediation produces observable
consequences which can also be detected to a level of order ~ +/- 80 GeV. In
this way, it is possible to distinguish between models with a large and small
stringy deformation. At 50 fb^(-1), this improves to ~ +/- 10 GeV.

temperature (T), which is important in the context of their use in nuclear
waste storage media. Extending our previous work on ZrSiO4, the Gibbs free
energy has been calculated using a transferable interatomic potential in
various phases over a range of P and T. Due to an interesting interplay between
the vibrational entropy and atomic packing, the zircon (body centered
tetragonal, I41/amd), scheelite (body centered tetragonal, I41/a) and huttonite
(monoclinic, P21/n) phases occur at different P and T. It is shown that for
ThSiO4 at high P, the huttonite and scheelite phases are favored at high and
low T respectively. However, for both USiO4 and HfSiO4 the huttonite phase is
dynamically unstable and the scheelite phase is stable as the high pressure
phase. In fact, the calculations reveal that the stability of the huttonite
phase is determined by the ionic size of the M-atom; this phase is unstable for
the silicate with the smaller Hf and U ions and stable with the larger Th ion.
The calculated phase diagrams are in fair agreement with the reported
experimental observations. The calculated structures, phonon spectra, and
various thermodynamic properties also fairly well reproduce the available
experimental data. The low-energy phonons in the huttonite phase that
contribute to its large vibrational entropy are found to involve librational

GeoP2P, to facilitate geographic location based search and retrieval of
information. Certain limitations of centralized geographic indexes favor
peer-to-peer organization of the information, which, in addition to avoiding
performance bottleneck, allows autonomy over local information. Peer-to-peer
systems for geographic or multidimensional range queries built on existing DHTs
suffer from the inaccuracy in linearization of the multidimensional space.
Other overlay structures that are based on hierarchical partitioning of the
search space are not scalable because they use special super-peers to represent
the nodes in the hierarchy. GeoP2P partitions the search space hierarchically,
maintains the overlay structure and performs the routing without the need of
any super-peers. Although similar fully-decentralized overlays have been
previously proposed, they lack the ability to dynamically grow and retract the
partition hierarchy when the number of peers change. GeoP2P provides such
adaptive features with minimum perturbation of the system state. Such
adaptation makes both the routing delay and the state size of each peer
logarithmic to the total number of peers, irrespective of the size of the
multidimensional space. Our analysis also reveals that the overlay structure
and the routing algorithm are generic and independent of several aspects of the
partitioning hierarchy, such as the geometric shape of the zones or the
dimensionality of the search space.

well potential of width w, whose center is placed into the hard sphere shell
($r < \sigma$): at $L = \sigma / n$ (n = 1, ..., 4). This paper presents a
general solution, for any n, of the first order Difference Differential

other models of associative fluids such as the CSM for homogeneus and
inhomogeneus mixtures of sticky shielded hard spheres including solvent effects
under PYA, and in that of mean-spherical approximation (MSA), for chemical ion
association and dipolar dumbbells and polymers. The sticky potential implies a
discontinuity step at $L$ in the solution of auxiliary Baxter's functions so
that, one side, $L$ now is arbitrary and, for some additional effects, it can
be placed one or more sticky potentials at different positions into the hard

regularization procedure. By letting one of the chambers of the cylinder
divided by the piston to be infinitely long, we obtain the Casimir force acting
on two parallel plates embedded in the cylinder. It is shown that if both the
plates assume Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions, the strength of the
Casimir force is reduced by the increase in mass. Under certain conditions, the
passage from massless to massive will change the nature of the force from long
range to short range. Other properties of the Casimir force such as its sign,
its behavior at low and high temperature, and its behavior at small and large
plate separations, are found to be similar to the massless case. Explicit exact

a locus in terms of the hamiltonians and we present the complete integration
algorithm for the Nilpotent Lax operators. The algorithm is finite, requires no
limit procedure and it is solely defined in terms of the initial data. For the
SL(3;R)/SO(1,2) coset we give an exhaustive classification of all orbits,
regular and singular, so providing general solutions for this case. Finally we
show that our integration algorithm can be generalized to generic
non-diagonalizable (in particular nilpotent) Lax matrices not necessarily
associated with symmetric spaces.

point of view. On Earth and Mars, water ice forms ice sheets, ice caps and
glaciers at the surface, which show glacial flow under their own weight. By
contrast, water ice is a major constituent of the bulk volume of the icy
satellites in the outer solar system, and ice flow can occur as thermal
convection. The rheology of polycrystalline aggregates of ordinary, hexagonal
ice Ih is described by a power law, different forms of which are discussed. The
temperature dependence of the ice viscosity follows an Arrhenius law.
Therefore, the flow of ice in a planetary environment constitutes a
thermo-mechanically coupled problem; its model equations are obtained by
inserting the flow law and the thermodynamic material equations in the balance
laws of mass, momentum and energy. As an example of gravity-driven flow, the
polar caps of Mars are discussed. For the north-polar cap, large-scale flow
velocities of the order of 0.1...1 mm/a are likely, locally enhanced by a
factor ten or more in the vicinity of surface scarps/troughs. By contrast, the
colder south-polar cap is expected to be almost stagnant. Tidally heated
convection is discussed for the example of the icy crust of Europa, where a
two-dimensional model predicts the formation of an upper, conductive lid and a
lower, convective layer with flow velocities of the order of 100 mm/a. Very
little is known about the fluid-dynamical relevance of high-pressure phases of
water ice as well as ices made up of other materials.

primordial binary evolution via a binary population synthesis approach, and
examined their contribution to the integrated spectral energy distributions of
the host clusters. The mass transfer efficiency, $\beta$, is an important
parameter for the final products (then blue stragglers) after mass transfer,
and it is set to be 0.5 except for case A binary evolution. The study shows
that primordial binary evolution may produce blue stragglers at any given times
and that different evolutionary channels are corresponding for blue stragglers
in different visual magnitude regions (in V band) on the colour-magnitude
diagram (CMD) of clusters. The specific frequency of blue stragglers obtained
from primordial binary evolution decreases with time first, and then increases
again when the age is larger than 10Gyr, while that from angular momentum loss
induced by magnetic braking in low-mass binaries increases with time and
exceeds that of primordial binary evolution in a population older than 3 Gyr.
Meanwhile, blue stragglers resulting from primordial binary evolution are
dominant contributors to the ISEDs in ultraviolet and blue bands in a
population between 0.3 and 2.0 Gyr. The value of $\beta$ significantly affects
on the final results. For old open clusters, the assumption of $\beta =1$ when
the primary is in HG at the onset of mass transfer matches the observations
better than that of $\beta =0.5$ from the locations of BSs on the CMDs. Our
study also shows that, for most Galactic open clusters, the specific frequency
of blue stragglers obtained from our simulations is lower than that of

to swim at speeds up to 25 diameters per second, without flagella or visible

self-propulsion is unknown. The only mechanism that has not been ruled out
employs tangential waves of surface deformations. In Ehlers et al, the average
swimming velocity for this mechanism was estimated using the methods
inaugurated by Taylor and Lighthill in the 1950's and revisited in differential
geometric language by Shapere and Wilczek in 1989. In this article we propose
an entirely different physical principle self propulsion based on acoustic
streaming (AS). Micro-pumps in silicon chips, based on AS, have been
constructed by engineers since the 1990's, but to the best of our knowledge
acoustic streaming as a means of microorganisms locomotion has not been
proposed before. Our hypothesis is supported by two recent discoveries: (1) In
Samuel, et al, deep-freeze electron microscopy of the motile strain WH8113
revealed a crystalline outer layer (CS) covered with a forest of ""spicules""
(Sp) extending from the inner membrane through the CS, projecting 150 nm into
the surrounding fluid. (2) In Pelling et al, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was
used to find that the cell wall of yeast cells periodically oscillates on
nano-scale amplitudes at frequencies of 0.8 to 1.6 kHz, and that the
oscillations are generated metabolically. We propose that the spicules, in
contact with the cell's power systems, could perform high frequency motions
generating acoustic streaming (AS) in the surrounding fluid. We compare two
models for self-propulsion employing acoustic streaming: the quartz wind effect
(QW) and boundary induced streaming generated by surface acoustic waves (SAW).

sum of multiple pulsar contributions and requires a single (or a few) energetic
pulsar(s). (2) A continuous injection produces a broad peak and a high energy
tail above the peak, which can constrain the source duration ($\lesssim 10^5$yr
with the current data). (3) The H.E.S.S. data in the TeV range suggest that
young sources with age less than $\sim 6 \times 10^4$yr are less energetic than

these lines originate from a site of high particle density. Such a likely site
could be the high-density, low temperature contact surface that should exist in
the shockfront in between the shocked ejecta and red giant wind. Recombination
analysis of the HI lines indicate deviations from Case B conditions during most
of the span of our observations indicating optical depth effects. It appears
likely that the breakout of the shockfront had not yet occured till the end of
our observations. An analysis is made of the temporal evolution of the [Si VI]
1.9641 micron coronal line and another coronal line at 2.0894 micron which is
attributed to [Mn XIV]. Assuming collisional effects to dominate in the hot
coronal gas, estimates are made of the ion temperature in the gas.

simultaneous binary hypothesis testing and parameter estimation. Although such
joint problems are not infrequent, there exist no systematic analysis in the
literature that treats them effectively. Existing approaches consider the
detection and the estimation subproblems separately, applying in each case the
corresponding optimum strategy. As it turns out the overall scheme is not
necessarily optimum since the criteria used for the two parts are usually
incompatible. In this article we propose a mathematical setup that considers
the two problems jointly. Specifically we propose a meaningful combination of
the Neyman-Pearson and the Bayesian criterion and we provide the optimum
solution for the joint problem. In the resulting optimum scheme the two parts
interact with each other, producing detection/estimation structures that are
completely novel. Notable side-product of our work is the proof that the well

degrees from face-on, and extends to a radius of 170 AU. These data are
combined with published optical and longer wavelength observations to make
qualitative comparisons between the median Taurus and PDS 66 spectral energy

the centre) of Milky Way can provide valuable information about the structure
of the dark matter halo. The recent 3-D thickness map of the outer HI disk from
the all sky 21-cm line LAB survey, gives us a unique opportunity to investigate
the structure of the dark matter halo of Milky Way in great detail. A striking
feature of this new survey is the North-South asymmetry in the thickness map of
the atomic hydrogen gas. Assuming vertical hydrostatic equilibrium under the
total potential of the Galaxy, we derive the model thickness map of the HI gas.
We show that simple axisymmetric halo models, such as softened isothermal halo
(producing a flat rotation curve with V_c ~ 220 km/s) or any halo with density
falling faster than the isothermal one, are not able to explain the observed
radial variation of the gas thickness. We also show that such axisymmetric
halos along with different HI velocity dispersion in the two halves, cannot
explain the observed asymmetry in the thickness map. Amongst the
non-axisymmetric models, it is shown that a purely lopsided (m=1, first
harmonic) dark matter halo with reasonable HI velocity dispersion fails to
explain the North-South asymmetry satisfactorily. However, we show that by
superposing a second harmonic (m=2) out of phase onto a purely lopsided halo
e.g. our best fit and more acceptable model A (with parameters
\epsilon_{h}^{1}=0.2, \epsilon_{h}^{2}=0.18 and \sigma_{HI}=8.5 km/s) can
provide an excellent fit to the observation and reproduce the North-South
asymmetry naturally. The emerging picture of the asymmetric dark matter halo is
supported by the \Lambda CDM halos formed in the cosmological N-body

redshifts are between 0.08 and 0.14. This strongly suggests that the cD is
associated with a group of galaxies whose conspicuous feature is a north-south
chain of galaxies (filament) extending to at least 2.6 Mpc. The $ROSAT$ All-Sky
Survey shows a faint, diffuse X-ray source in this direction, which probably
marks the hot intra-cluster gas in the potential well of this group.
  We combine the radio structural information for this WAT with the galaxy
clustering in that region to check its overall consistency with the models of
WAT formation. The bending of the jet before and after its disruption forming
the radio plume, are found to be correlated in this WAT, as seen from the
contrasting morphological patterns on the two sides of the core. Probable
constraints imposed by this on the models of WAT formation are pointed out. We
also briefly report on the other interesting radio sources found in the
proximity of the WAT. These include a highly asymmetric double radio source and
an ultra-steep spectrum radio source for which no optical counterpart is
detected in the SDSS.

(GADGET-2) with radiative cooling and a recipe for star formation and stellar
feedback 12 different ram-pressure stripping scenarios for disc galaxies were
calculated. Special emphasis was put on the gas within the disc and in the
surroundings. All gas particles within the computational domain having the same
mass resolution. The relative velocity was varied from 100 km/s to 1000 km/s in
different surrounding gas densities in the range from $1\times10^{-28}$ to
$5\times10^{-27}$ g/cm$^3$. The temperature of the surrounding gas was
initially $1\times10^{7}$ K. The star formation of a galaxy is enhanced by more
than a magnitude in the simulation with a high ram-pressure ($5\times10^{-11}$
dyn/cm$^2$) in comparison to the same system evolving in isolation. The
enhancement of the star formation depends more on the surrounding gas density
than on the relative velocity. Up to 95% of all newly formed stars can be found
in the wake of the galaxy out to distances of more than 350 kpc behind the
stellar disc. Continuously stars fall back to the old stellar disc, building up
a bulge-like structure. Young stars can be found throughout the stripped wake
with surface densities locally comparable to values in the inner stellar disc.
Ram-pressure stripping can shift the location of star formation from the disc
into the wake on very short timescales. (Abridged)

algebra $R=k<x,y>/ (xy-yx-y^2)$, known as Jordan plane (or Jordan algebra).
  We consider the question on 'classification' of finite-dimensional modules
over the Jordan algebra. Complete description of irreducible components of the
representation variety $mod (R,n)$, which we call a Jordan variety' is given
for any dimension $n$. It is obtained on the basis of the stratification of
this variety related to the Jordan normal form of $Y$. Any irreducible
component of the representation variety contains only one stratum related to a
certain partition of $n$ and is the closure of this stratum. The number of
irreducible components therefore is equal to the number of partitions of $n$.
  As a preparation for the above result we describe the complete set of
pairwise non-isomorphic irreducible modules $S_{a}$ over the Jordan algebra,
and the rule how they could be glued to indecomposables. Namely, we show that
${\rm Ext}^1(S_{a},S_{b})=0$, if $a \neq b $.
  We study then properties of the image algebras in the endomorphism ring.
Particularly, images of representations from the most important stratum,
corresponding to the full Jordan block $Y$. This stratum turns out to be the
only building block for the analogue of the Krull-Remark-Schmidt decomposition
theorem on the level of irreducible components. Along this line we establish an
analogue of the Gerstenhaber--Taussky--Motzkin theorem on the dimension of
algebras generated by two commuting matrices. Another fact concerns with the
tame-wild question for those image algebras. We show that all image algebras of
$n$-dimensional representations are tame for $n \leq 4$ and wild for $n \geq
5$.

describe a strategy for tuning Q-bands using a new class of micro-resonators,
named micro-kylix resonators, in which engineered stress within an initially

60nm towards short wavelengths in flat micro-disks a 50% diameter reduction is
required, which causes severe radiative losses suppressing Q's. With a
micro-kylix, we achieve similar tuning and even higher Q's by two orders of
magnitude smaller diameter modification (0.4%). The phenomenon relies on
geometry-induced smart interplay between modified dispersions of material
absorption and radiative loss-related Q-factors. Micro-kylix devices can
provide new functionalities and novel technological solutions for photonics and

fields is studied for conducting incompressible fluids of uniform density
between two infinitely long cylinders rotating around the same axis. It is
shown that for resting cylinders the critical Hartmann number for the unstable
modes does not depend on Pm. By rigid rotation the instability is suppressed
where the critical ratio of the rotation velocity and the Alfven velocity of
the field (only) slightly depends on the magnetic Prandtl number Pm. For Pm=1
the rotational quenching of TI takes its maximum. Rotation laws with negative
shear (i.e. d\Omega/dR<0) strongly destabilize the toroidal field if the
rotation is not too fast. For sufficiently high Reynolds numbers of rotation
the suppression of the nonaxisymmetric magnetic instability always dominates.
The angular momentum transport of the instability is anticorrelated with the
shear so that an eddy viscosity can be defined which proves to be positive. For
negative shear the Maxwell stress of the perturbations remarkably contributes
to the angular momentum transport. We have also shown the possibility of
laboratory TI experiments with a wide-gap container filled with fluid metals
like sodium or gallium. Even the effect of the rotational stabilization can be
reproduced in the laboratory with electric currents of only a few kAmp.

this purpose, we have developed a method to accurately determine the outer
radius (R) of any circularly symmetric compact radio structure like SN1993J.
  The source structure of SN1993J remains circularly symmetric (with deviations
from circularity under 2%) over almost 4000 days. We characterize the
decelerated expansion of SN 1993J through approximately day 1500 after
explosion with an expansion parameter $m= 0.845\pm0.005$ ($R \propto t^{m}$).
However, from that day onwards the expansion is different when observed at 6
and 18cm. Indeed, at 18cm, the expansion can be well characterized by the same
$m$ as before day 1500, while at 6cm the expansion appears more decelerated,
and is characterized by another expansion parameter, $m_{6}= 0.788\pm0.015$.
Therefore, since about day 1500 on, the radio source size has been
progressively smaller at 6cm than at 18cm. These findings are in stark contrast
to previous reports by other authors on the details of the expansion. In our
interpretation the supernova expands with a single expansion parameter, $m=
0.845\pm0.005$, and the 6cm results beyond day 1500 are due to physical
effects, perhaps also coupled to instrumental limitations. Two physical effects
may be involved: (a) a changing opacity of the ejecta to the 6cm radiation, and
(b) a radial decrease of the magnetic field in the emitting region.

we proved a similar assertion on the spectrum. After this first proof was
written, the first named author found a more conceptual proof using the
Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem where the assertion on the jumping numbers was
proved without reducing to that for the spectrum. In this paper we improve
these methods and show that the jumping numbers and the spectrum are calculable
in low dimensions without using a computer. In the reduced case we show that
these depend only on fewer combinatorial data, and give completely explicit

Mustata's formula for the spectrum.

may have an arbitrary distribution of spatial scales. The time evolution of the

a^{k*}(t+tau)>, and an equation for the cross correlations <a^k a^l*>. The
eigenfunctions of the dynamo equation (with eigenvalues lambda_k) turn out to
be a preferred set in terms of which our results assume their simplest form.
The magnetic field of the dynamo is shown to consist of transiently excited
eigenmodes whose frequency and coherence time is given by Im(lambda_k) and
-1/(Re lambda_k), respectively. The relative r.m.s. excitation level of the
eigenmodes, and hence the distribution of magnetic energy over spatial scales,

is able to account for collision of the winds, formation of lobes and jets by
accretion onto the WD, as well as for the interaction of the blast wave from a

infrared and millimeter observations, potentially able to resolve the inner

galaxy, regardless of the galaxy's metallicity, but that higher-metallicity
galaxies tend to harbor more stars with slight IR excesses. The optical
incompleteness increases for the redder AGB stars, in line with the expectation
that some AGB stars are not detected in the optical due to large amounts of
extinction associated with in situ dust production. Overall, there is an
underrepresentation of 30% - 40% in the optical AGB within the 1 sigma errors
for all of the galaxies in our sample. This undetected population is large
enough to affect star formation histories derived from optical color-magnitude
diagrams. As measured from the [3.6] - [4.5] color excesses, we find average
stellar mass-loss rates ranging from 3.1E-7 - 6.6E-6 solar masses per year, and
integrated galaxy mass-loss rates ranging from 4.4E-5 - 1.4E-3 solar masses per

noise photons are returned to the receiver in its absence. This model
facilitates us to obtain analytic results on error-probability bounds i.e., the
quantum Chernoff bound and the lower bound constructed from the Bhattacharya
bound on M-copy discrimination error-probabilities of some important quantum
states, like photon number states, N00N states, coherent states and the
entangled photons obtained from spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC).
Comparing the $M$-copy error-bounds, we identify that N00N states indeed offer
enhanced sensitivity than the photon number state system, when average signal
photon number is small compared to the thermal noise level. However, in the
high signal-to-noise scenario, N00N states fail to be advantageous than the
photon number states. Entangled SPDC photon pairs too outperform conventional
coherent state system in the low signal-to-noise case. On the other hand,
conventional coherent state system surpasses the performance sensitivity
offered by entangled photon pair, when the signal intensity is much above that

detection (where the target is modeled as a weakly reflecting object) in a high

observations of the Balmer jump. If a higher T_eff value was used (as favoured
by some photometric calibrations), the spectroscopic analysis would indicate a
turnoff-point stage of evolution. Using a stellar-structure code that treats
the effects of atomic diffusion throughout the star in detail, we evolve a
low-mass model star to reach the HR-diagram position of HE 1327-2326 after
roughly 13 Gyr. While the surface abundances are modified significantly (by
more than 1 dex for the case of uninhibited diffusion), such corrections can
not resolve the discrepancy between the abundance inferred from the
non-detection of the Li I resonance line at 6707 Angstroem and the WMAP-based
primordial lithium abundance. As there are numerous processes that can destroy
lithium, any cosmological interpretation of a lower-than-expected lithium
abundance at the lowest metallicities will have to await sample sizes of
unevolved hyper-metal-poor stars that are one order of magnitude larger. The
situation remains equally inconclusive concerning atomic-diffusion corrections.
Here, attempts have to be made to better constrain internal mixing processes,
both observationally and by means of sophisticated modelling. With constraints
on additional mixing processes taken from a recent globular-cluster study, the
likeliest scenario is that HE 1327-2326's surface abundances have undergone
mild depletion (of order 0.2 dex).

disequilibrium (LD) is an important issue in order to understand the genomic
architecture. A large variety of such measures of association have been
proposed in the literature. We propose and justify six biometrical postulates
which should be fulfilled by a canonical measure of LD. In short, LD measures
are defined as a mapping of probability tables to the set of real numbers. They
should be zero in case of independence and extremal if one of the entries
approaches zero while the marginals are positively bounded. They should reflect
the symmetry group of the tables and be invariant under certain transformations
of the marginals (selection invariance). There scale should have maximum
entropy relative to a calibrating symmetric distribution. None of the
established measures fulfil all of these properties in general. We prove that
there is a unique canonical measure of LD for each choice of a calibrating
distribution. We compa- re the canonical LD measures with other candidates from

carrying the same surname, or the same DNA sequence) in a given size subsample
of an exponentially growing population. We approach the problem from two
directions. In the first, we construct the family size distribution for the
subsample from the stable distribution for the full population. This latter
distribution is calculated for an arbitrary growth process in the limit of slow
growth, and is seen to depend only on the average and variance of the number of
children per individual, as well as the mutation rate. The distribution for the
subsample is shifted left with respect to the original distribution, tending to
eliminate the part of the original distribution reflecting the small families,
and thus increasing the mean family size. From the subsample distribution,
various bulk quantities such as the average family size and the percentage of
singleton families are calculated. In the second approach, we study the past
time development of these bulk quantities, deriving the statistics of the
genealogical tree of the subsample. This approach reproduces that of the first
when the current statistics of the subsample is considered. The surname
distribution from th e 2000 U.S. Census is examined in light of these findings,
and found to misrepresent the population growth rate by a factor of 1000.
