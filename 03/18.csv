finite dissipation substitutes the zero-coupling result of exponential decay of

vanishes linearly with temperature, $T$, in conformity with Nernst's theorem.
It is also shown that entropy decays faster in the presence of anomalous
coupling than that of the usual coordinate-coordinate coupling. It is observed
that velocity-velocity coupling is the most advantageous coupling scheme to
ensure the third law of thermodynamics. It is also revealed that different
thermodynamic functions are independent of magnetic field at very low
temperature for various coupling schemes discussed in this work.

this negative-parity state is above the N\pi threshold and, therefore, the

Luescher's method. The disconnected contributions to this process are included

As a result of uniaxial magnetic anisotropy in the tilted structures, we
observe sharp magnetization switching behavior. At temperatures close to $T_c$,
the magnetization switching induces resistance jumps in trilayers, resulting in
a magnetization dependence of $T_c$. In bilayers, this switching effect can be
observed as well, provided that the interface to the ferromagnetic layer is
considerably rough. Our results indicate that the switching behavior arises
from magnetic stray fields from the ferromagnetic layers that penetrate into
the superconductor. A simple model describes the observed behavior well. We
find no evidence that the switching behavior is caused by a so-called
superconducting spin-switch, nor by accumulation of spin-polarized electrons.
Observation of magnetic coupling of the ferromagnetic layers, through the
superconductor, supports the idea of field induced resistance switching.

that variability in these random variables had opposite effects on the epidemic
growth rate. That rate increased with greater variability in latency but
decreased with greater variability in infectivity. Here we extend their result
by using the McKay bivariate gamma distribution for the joint distribution of
latency and infectivity, recovering the above effects of variability but
allowing possible correlation. We use methods of stochastic rate processes to
obtain explicit solutions for the growth of the epidemic and the evolution of
the inhomogeneity and information entropy. We obtain a closed analytic solution
to the evolution of the distribution of the number of uninfected individuals as
the epidemic proceeds, and a concomitant expression for the decay of entropy.
The family of McKay bivariate gamma distributions has a tractable information
geometry which provides a framework in which the evolution of distributions can
be studied as the outbreak grows, with a natural distance structure for
quantitative tracking of progress.

simply dividing the inter-event times with their average values. Differently,

become popular in recent years. A general theory is developed for learning with
structured sparsity, based on the notion of coding complexity associated with
the structure. It is shown that if the coding complexity of the target signal
is small, then one can achieve improved performance by using coding complexity
regularization methods, which generalize the standard sparse regularization.
Moreover, a structured greedy algorithm is proposed to efficiently solve the
structured sparsity problem. It is shown that the greedy algorithm
approximately solves the coding complexity optimization problem under
appropriate conditions. Experiments are included to demonstrate the advantage

Hubbard model on the ""hyper-kagome lattice"", which forms a three-dimensional
network of corner sharing triangles, using dynamical cluster approximation
(DCA) method with $N_c$=12 combined with the continuous-time quantum Monte
Carlo (CT QMC) method. The system undergoes a Mott transition if the Hubbard
interaction $U/W$ ($W$ is the bandwidth) exceeds the value of 1.2 for $T$=0.1
and displays reentrant behavior due to competition between the magnetic
correlation and the kinetic energy of electrons due to the geometrical
frustration. We observe a ""critical slowing down"" of the double occupancy which
shows evidence of a continuous transition. The nearest-neighbor and next
nearest-neighbor spin-spin correlations indicate a paramagnetic metallic state
in the weak-coupling regime and an antiferromagnetic (AF) Mott insulator in the
strong-coupling regime within the temperature range which we can access with
our numerical tools.

intensity $I(\omega)$ for ultracold Fermi gases. First, in the absence of final

C\omega^{-3/2}$ for \emph{all} many-body states, where $C$ is Tan's contact.
Second, in a \emph{normal} Fermi liquid at T=0, $I(\omega)$ has a jump
discontinuity of $Z/(1 - m/m^{*})$, where $Z$ is the quasiparticle weight and
$m^*/m$ the mass renormalization. We then describe various approximations for
$I(\omega)$ in polarized normal gases. We show why an approximation that is
exact in the $n_\dn=0$ limit, fails qualitatively for $n_{\dn} > 0$: there is
no universal tail and sum rules are violated. The simple ladder approximation
is qualitatively correct for very small $n_{\dn}$, but not quantitatively.

of the Solar System are presented.
  1) Early differentiation: A few recent results support the idea that
protoplanet formation and differentiation occurred partly simultaneously than
CAI formation. First, some iron meteorites, eucrites, and angrites older than
the chondrules or even than the CAI have been found. Second, iron meteorites
could be debris of early disrupted differentiated planetesimals, scattered from
the terrestrial planet region to the Main Belt. Finally, chondrules contain
fragments of planetesimal material.
  2) Earth and Moon: An equilibration mechanism explains the identical Oxygen
isotopic composition of the Earth and the Moon. In addition, it has been shown
that the Earth and the Moon mantles have the same 182^W anomaly, in contrast to
what was believed before. Consequently, the Moon forming impact should have
occurred after the extinction of the 182Hf radioactivity, about 60 Myr after
Solar System formation. This new datation is in agreement with new N-body
numerical simulations of the last phase of terrestrial planets formation, in
which giant impacts occur during about 100 Myr.
  3) Giant planets and Nice model: The migration of the giant planets in the
protoplanetary disc can be prevented if the planets are in resonance, close to
each other. In the ``Nice model'', the 4 outer planets of the Solar System were
in a compact configuration after the dissipation of gaseous disc. A few hundred
million years later, a global instability drives the planets on their present
orbits, producing the Late Heavy Bombardment. In this frame, a lot of
characteristics of our Solar System can be explained.

in detail and the azimuthal and radial background velocities of species are
calculated. The azimuthal velocity of ions, dust grains, and neutrals is found
to be less than the Keplerian velocity. The radial velocity of neutrals and
dust grains is shown to be directed inward of the disk. The general solution
for the perturbed velocities of species taking into account collisions and
thermal pressure is obtained. The effect on the collisional frequencies, due to
density perturbations of charged species and neutrals, is included. It is shown
that dust grains can be involved in the fast electromagnetic perturbations
induced by the ions and electrons through the strong collisions of these grains
with neutrals that in turn have a strong collisional coupling with the ions.
The dispersion relation for the vertical perturbations is derived and its
unstable solutions due to different background velocities of ions and electrons

of the LSB galaxies have (NUV-r) colors similar to those for higher surface
brightness star-forming galaxies of similar luminosity indicating that their
average star formation histories are not very different. Based upon four LSB
galaxies with both UV and FIR data, we find FIR/UV ratios significantly less
than one, implying low amounts of internal UV extinction in LSB galaxies. We
use the UV images and HI maps to measure the star formation rate and hydrogen
gas surface densities within the same region for all of the galaxies. The LSB
galaxy star formation rate surface densities lie below the extrapolation of the
power law fit to the star formation rate surface density as a function of the
total gas density for higher surface brightness galaxies. Although there is
more scatter, the LSB galaxies also lie below a second version of the star
formation law in which the star formation rate surface density is correlated
with the gas density divided by the orbital time in the disk. The downturn seen
in both star formation laws is consistent with theoretical models that predict
lower star formation efficiencies in LSB galaxies due to the declining
molecular fraction with decreasing density.

perpendicular to the planes of pulsar dipolar magnetic field. However, the
fundamental question whether these waves are excited by maser or coherent
curvature radiation, remains open. High quality single pulse polarimetry is
required to distinguish between these two possible mechanisms. Here we showcase
such {\it decisive} strong single pulses from 10 pulsars observed with the
GMRT, showing extremely high linear polarization with the position angle
following locally the mean position angle traverse. These pulses, which are
relatively free from depolarization, must consist of exclusively single
polarization mode. We associate this mode with the extraordinary wave excited

enables us to argue, for the first time, in favor of the coherent curvature
emission mechanism, excluding the maser mechanism.

gamma-ray bursts have been observed to propagate with Lorentz factors laying in
the range between one and several hundreds. On the other hand, the numerical
studies of such flows have been focussed so far mainly on the lowest possible
range of Lorentz factors $\Gamma,$ specifically, on the regime $1\leq \Gamma
\leq 5.$ Therefore, relativistic flows with high $\Gamma-$factors have poorly
studied, as most numerical methods are found to encounter severe numerical
difficulties or even become numerically unstable for $\Gamma \gg 1. In this
paper we present an implicit numerical advection scheme for modeling the
propagation of relativistic plasmas with shocks, discuss its consistency with
respect to both the internal and total energy formulation in general
relativity. Using the total energy formulation, the scheme is found to be
viable for modeling moving shocks with moderate Lorentz factors, though with
relatively small Courant numbers. In the limit of high Lorentz factors, the
internal energy formulation in combination with a fine-tuned artificial
viscosity is much more robust and efficient. We confirm our conclusions by
performing test calculations and compare the results with analytical solutions
of the relativistic shock tube problem. The aim of the present modification is
to enhance the robustness of the general relativistic implicit radiative MHD

line from the blend. We have performed this procedure on the raster data of
five active regions and a limb flare, and demonstrated that the Ca XVII line
can be satisfactorily extracted from the blend if the Ca XVII flux contributes
to at least ~10% of the blend. We show examples of the high-temperature corona
depicted by the Ca XVII emission and find that the Ca XVII emission has three
morphological features in these active regions -- 1) `fat' medium-sized loops
confined in a smaller space than the 1 million degree corona, 2) weaker,
diffuse emission surrounding these loops that spread over the core of the
active region, and 3) the locations of the strong Ca XVII loops are often weak
in line emission formed from the 1 million degree plasma. We find that the
emission measure ratio of the 6 million degree plasma relative to the cooler 1
million degree plasma in the core of the active regions, using the Ca XVII to
Fe XI line intensity ratio as a proxy, can be as high as 10. Outside of the
active region core where the 1 million degree loops are abundant, the ratio has
an upper limit of about 0.5.

our new method does not suffer from systematic bias and offers small

different higher redshifts, we have found that the redshift dependence of the

asymmetry itself, with larger corrections for more asymmetric objects. By
applying redshift-, IR-luminosity- and optical-brightness-dependent asymmetry
corrections, we have found that intermediate-redshift LIRGs generally show
highly asymmetric morphologies, with implied merger fractions ~50% up to z=1.2,

galaxies, we find an almost constant relatively high merger fraction (20-30%).
The B-band LFs of galaxy mergers are derived at different redshifts up to z=1.2

luminosity-density degeneracy. The IR luminosity functions (LFs) of galaxy
mergers are also derived, indicating a larger merger fraction at higher IR

the merger-induced IR energy density [(1+z)^(5-6)}], and that galaxy mergers

of the disruption of Sagittarius in Galactic potentials with different degrees

derived from high-resolution spectroscopic observations of microlensed dwarf
and subgiant stars. We then aim to use microlensed dwarf and subgiant stars to
investigate the abundance structure and chemical evolution of the Milky Way
Bulge. [ABRIDGED] METHODS. We present a detailed elemental abundance analysis
of OGLE-2008-BLG-209S, the source star of a new microlensing event towards the
Bulge, for which we obtained a high-resolution spectrum with the MIKE
spectrograph on the Magellan Clay telescope. We have performed four different
analyses of OGLE-2008-BLG-209S. [ABRIDGED] We have also re-analysed three
previous microlensed dwarf stars OGLE-2006-BLG-265S, MOA-2006-BLG-099S, and
OGLE-2007-BLG-349S with the same method. This homogeneous data set, although
small, enables a direct comparison between the different stellar populations.
RESULTS. We find that OGLE-2008-BLG-209S is a subgiant star that has a
metallicity of [Fe/H] ~-0.33. It possesses [alpha/Fe] enhancements similar to
what is found for Bulge giant stars at the same metallicity, and what also is
found for nearby thick disc stars at the same metallicity. In contrast, the
previous three microlensing dwarf stars have very high metallicities,
[Fe/H]>+0.4, and more solar-like abundance ratios, i.e. [alpha/Fe]~0. The
decrease in the [alpha/Fe] ratio with [Fe/H] is the typical signature of
enrichment from low and intermediate mass stars. We furthermore find that the
results for the four Bulge stars, in combination with results from studies of
giant stars in the Bulge, seem to favour a secular formation scenario for the
Bulge.

optical and near-IR imaging obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope and
ground-based facilities. This is a prototypical case of a source that is
extremely obscured by dust, for which it is practically impossible to derive a
spectroscopic redshift in the optical/near-IR. Under the hypothesis that GN10
is part of a proto-cluster structure previously identified at z~4.05 in the
same field, we searched for CO[4-3] at 91.4 GHz with the IRAM Plateau de Bure
Interferometer, and successfully detected a line. We find that the most likely
redshift identification is z=4.0424+-0.0013, based on: 1) the very low chance
that the CO line is actually serendipitous from a different redshift; 2) a
radio-IR photometric redshift analysis; 3) the identical radio-IR SED, within a
scaling factor, of two other SMGs at the same redshift. The faintness at
optical/near-IR wavelengths requires an attenuation of A_V~5-7.5 mag. This
result supports the case that a substantial population of very high-z SMGs
exists that had been missed by previous spectroscopic surveys. This is the
first time that a CO emission line has been detected for a galaxy that is
invisible in the optical and near-IR. Our work demonstrates the power of
existing and planned facilities for completing the census of star formation and
stellar mass in the distant Universe by measuring redshifts of the most

millisecond pulsars (MSPs), occur abundantly in globular clusters (GCs). GCs
are therefore expected to host large numbers of MSPs. This is also confirmed
observationally. The MSPs continuously inject relativistic electrons into the
ambient region beyond their light cylinders, and these relativistic particles
produce unpulsed radiation via the synchrotron and inverse Compton (IC)
processes. It is thus possible, in the context of General Relativistic (GR)
frame-dragging MSP models, to predict unpulsed very high energy radiation
expected from nearby GCs. We use a period-derivative cleaned sample of MSPs in
47 Tucanae, where the effects of the cluster potential on the individual period
derivatives have been removed. Using a Monte Carlo process to include effects
of pulsar geometry, we obtain average injection spectra (with relatively small
errors) of particles leaving the MSPs. These spectra are next used to predict
cumulative synchrotron and IC spectra expected from 47 Tucanae, which is a
lower limit, as no reacceleration is assumed. We find that the IC radiation
from 47 Tucanae may be visible for H.E.S.S., depending on the nebular field B
as well as the number of MSPs N in the GC. Telescopes such as Chandra and
Hubble may find it difficult to test the SR component prediction of diffuse
radiation if there are many unresolved sources in the field of view. These
results may be rescaled for other GCs where less information is available,

in $n$ variables by adding commuting, {\em left} (but not two-sided) inverses
of the canonical generators of $P_n$. Ignoring non-Noetherian property, the
algebra $\mS_n$ belongs to a family of algebras like the Weyl algebra $A_n$ and
the polynomial algebra $P_{2n}$. The group of automorphisms $G_n$ of the
algebra $\mS_n$ is found: $$ G_n=S_n\ltimes \mT^n\ltimes \Inn (\mS_n) \supseteq
S_n\ltimes \mT^n\ltimes \underbrace{\GL_\infty (K)\ltimes... \ltimes \GL_\infty

is the $n$-dimensional torus, $\Inn (\mS_n)$ is the group of inner
automorphisms of $\mS_n$ (which is huge), and $\GL_\infty (K)$ is the group of
invertible infinite dimensional matrices. This result may help in understanding
of the structure of the groups of automorphisms of the Weyl algebra $A_n$ and
the polynomial algebra $P_{2n}$. An analog of the {\em Jacobian homomorphism}:
$\Aut_{K-{\rm alg}}(P_{2n})\ra K^*$, so-called, the {\em global determinant} is
introduced for the group $G_n'$ (notice that the algebra $\mS_n$ is {\em
noncommutative} and neither left nor right Noetherian).

existing and publicly available catalogs. As well as the photometric catalog,
we also present catalogs of photometric redshifts and restframe photometry

redshift determinations from published sources for 1966 galaxies in the

redshift accuracy of Dz/(1+z) = 0.036, with an outlier fraction of 7.8%. Most
of these outliers are X-ray sources. Finally, we describe and release a utility
for interpolating restframe photometry from observed SEDs, dubbed InterRest.

magnetic fields based on radio polarimetry data. Second-order magnetic field
statistics like the power spectrum cannot always distinguish between magnetic
fields with essentially different spatial structure. Synchrotron polarimetry
naturally allows certain 4th-order magnetic field statistics to be inferred
from observational data, which lifts this degeneracy and can thereby help us
gain a better picture of the structure of the cosmic fields and test
theoretical scenarios describing magnetic turbulence. In this work we show that
a 4th-order correlator of physical interest, the tension-force spectrum, can be
recovered from the polarized synchrotron emission data. We develop an estimator
for this quantity based on polarized-emission observations in the
Faraday-rotation-free frequency regime. We consider two cases: a statistically
isotropic field distribution, and a statistically isotropic field superimposed
on a weak mean field. In both cases the tension force power spectrum is
measurable; in the latter case, the magnetic power spectrum may also be
obtainable. The method is exact in the idealized case of a homogeneous
relativistic-electron distribution that has a power-law energy spectrum with a
spectral index p=3, and assumes statistical isotropy of the turbulent field. We
carry out tests of our method using synthetic data generated from numerically
simulated magnetic fields. We show that the method is valid, that it is not
prohibitively sensitive to the value of the electron spectral index, and that
the observed tension-force spectrum allows one to distinguish between, e.g., a
randomly tangled magnetic field (a default assumption in many studies) and a
field organized in folded flux sheets or filaments.

with projected separations < 40 AU are half as likely to retain at least one

results represent the first statistically significant evidence for a
correlation between binary separation and the presence of an inner disk (r ~ 1
AU). Several factors (e.g., the incompleteness of the census of close binaries,
the use of unresolved disk indicators, and projection effects) have previously
masked this correlation in smaller samples. We discuss the implications of our

such as hydrogen bonding, which are poorly described by continuum dielectric

volume description. We have introduced an analytical Solvent Excluding Volume
(SEV) model which reduces the effect of spurious high-dielectric interstitial

volume. The AGBNP2 model is parametrized and tested with respect to
experimental hydration free energies of small molecules and the results of
explicit solvent simulations. Modeling the granularity of water is one of the
main design principles employed for the the first shell solvation function and
the SEV model, by requiring that water locations have a minimum available
volume based on the size of a water molecule. We show that the new volumetric
model produces Born radii and surface areas in good agreement with accurate

remnants of gas-rich mergers between spirals, motivating more detailed studies
of the imprint of this formation mechanism on the remnant distribution
function. Gas has a strong impact on the non-Gaussian shapes of the
line-of-sight velocity distributions (LOSVDs) of the merger remnant, owing to
the embedded disk that forms out of the gas that retains its angular momentum
during the merger, and the strong central mass concentration from the gas that
falls to the center. The deviations from Gaussianity are parametrized by the
Gauss-Hermite moments h_3 and h_4, which are related to the skewness and
kurtosis of the LOSVDs. We quantify the dependence of the (h_3,h_4)-v/sigma
relations on the initial gas fraction of the progenitor disks in 1:1 mergers,
using Gadget-2 simulations including star formation, radiative cooling, and
feedback from supernovae and AGN. For gas fractions f_gas < ~15% the overall
correlation between h_3 and v/sigma is weak, consisting of a flat negatively
correlated component arising from edge-on viewing angles plus a steep
positively correlated part from face-on projections. The spread in v/sigma
values decreases toward high positive h_4, and there is a trend toward lower
h_4 as the gas fraction increases from 0 to 15%. For f_gas > ~20% the (h_3,4)-
v/sigma distributions look quite different - there is a tight negative h_3-
v/sigma correlation, and a wide spread in v/sigma values at all h_4, in better
agreement with observations. Re-mergers of the high-f_gas remnants (dry
mergers) produce slowly rotating systems with nearly Gaussian LOSVDs. We
explain all of these trends in terms of the underlying orbit structure of the
remnants, as molded by their dissipative formation histories.

excess phenomenon is examined in the context of emission filaments, which are
the higher density part of the warm hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) residing at
the outskirt of clusters. We derived an analytic radial profile of the soft
excess surface brightness using a simple filament model, which provided us a
means of observationally constraining the WHIM parameters, especially the total
mass budget of warm gas associated with a cluster. We then pointed out a new
scenario for soft excess emission, viz. a cluster that can strongly lens the
soft X-rays from background WHIM knots. If, as seems quite likely, the missing
baryons are mostly in the WHIM halos of galaxy groups, the lensing probability
will be quite high ($\sim$ 10 %). This way of accounting for at least part of a
cluster's soft excess may also explain the absence of O VII absorption at the

analysis of Newtonian stellar structure is simple in principle if the system is
axisymmetric, or consists of a corotating binary. It is then required only to
solve two equations: one stating that the ""injection energy"", $\kappa$, a
potential, is constant throughout the stellar fluid, and the other being the
integral over the stellar fluid to give the gravitational potential. An
iterative solution of these equations generally diverges if $\kappa$ is held
fixed, but converges with other choices. We investigate the mathematical reason
for this convergence/divergence by starting the iteration from an approximation
that is perturbatively different from the actual solution. A cycle of iteration
is then treated as a linear ""updating"" operator, and the properties of the
linear operator, especially its spectrum, determine the convergence properties.
For simplicity, we confine ourselves to spherically symmetric models in which
we analyze updating operators both in the finite dimensional space
corresponding to a finite difference representation of the problem, and in the
continuum, and we find that the fixed-$\kappa$ operator is self-adjoint and
generally has an eigenvalue greater than unity; in the particularly important
case of a polytropic equation of state with index greater than unity, we prove
that there must be such an eigenvalue. For fixed central density, on the other
hand, we find that the updating operator has only a single eigenvector, with
zero eigenvalue, and is nilpotent in finite dimension, thereby giving a
convergent solution.

effects. We again search for parameters that can yield results consistent with
observations in regards to the mean polarization, the ratio of polarimetric to
photometric variability, and the volume filling factor. Clump generation and
spatial distribution are randomized by the Monte Carlo method so as to produce
clumps which are, in the mean, distributed uniformly in space and have time
intervals with a Gaussian distribution. The generated clumps move radially
outward with a velocity law determined by a beta index, and the angular size of
the clumps is assumed to keep fixed. By fitting the observational results and
the volume filling factor, the clump velocity law index beta and clump ejection
rate are inferred, and are found to be well constrained. In addition, the
subpeak features on broad emission lines seem to support the clump ejection
rate. Meanwhile, the fraction of the total mass loss rate that is contained in
the clumps is obtained by fitting the observed polarization. We conclude that
this picture for the clump properties produces a valuable diagnostic of WR wind

the ISI-distance, employs the ratio of instantaneous interspike intervals. In
this study we propose two extensions of the ISI-distance, the straightforward

many properties desirable in applications to real data. In particular, they are

different levels of multi-neuron spike train synchrony to the performance of
six other previously published measures. We show and explain why the averaged
bivariate measures perform better than the multivariate ones and why the
multivariate ISI-diversity is the best performer among the multivariate

generated with nearly the same electron-hole crossing energy as that at the

the Landau levels at charge neutral filling becomes 4(2N+1)-fold degenerate
(with N=0,1,2,..., tunable by the potential strength and periodicity) with the

confidential communication with an arbitrary number of users in the presence of
an external eavesdropper. We derive the secrecy capacity region of this channel
for the most general case. We first show that even for the single-input
single-output (SISO) case, existing converse techniques for the Gaussian scalar
broadcast channel cannot be extended to this secrecy context, to emphasize the
need for a new proof technique. Our new proof technique makes use of the
relationships between the minimum-mean-square-error and the mutual information,
and equivalently, the relationships between the Fisher information and the
differential entropy. Using the intuition gained from the converse proof of the
SISO channel, we first prove the secrecy capacity region of the degraded MIMO
channel, in which all receivers have the same number of antennas, and the noise
covariance matrices can be arranged according to a positive semi-definite
order. We then generalize this result to the aligned case, in which all
receivers have the same number of antennas, however there is no order among the
noise covariance matrices. We accomplish this task by using the channel
enhancement technique. Finally, we find the secrecy capacity region of the
general MIMO channel by using some limiting arguments on the secrecy capacity
region of the aligned MIMO channel. We show that the capacity achieving coding
scheme is a variant of dirty-paper coding with Gaussian signals.

relevant to the physics of cold atom systems, in non-equilibrium situations
obtained by fast sweeping through a Feshbach resonance. We show that in this

forbids the existence of global action-angle coordinates. Explicit calculations

detailed semi-classical analysis of the associated eigenstates. Whereas most of
the levels are well described by the usual Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rules,
properly adapted to polar coordinates, we show how these rules are modified in
the vicinity of the critical level. The spectral decomposition of the

state which travels a distance $\lambda \equiv v/\Gamma$ on the order of
galactic scales and then decays to Standard Model (SM) particles. The long
lifetime disperses the production zone of the SM particles away from the
galactic center and hence, relaxes constraints from gamma ray observations on
canonical annihilation scenarios. We utilize this set up to explain the
electron and positron excesses observed recently by PAMELA, ATIC, and FERMI.
While an explanation in terms of usual DM annihilations seems to conflict with
gamma ray observations, we show that within the proposed scenario, the
PAMELA/ATIC/FERMI results are consistent with the gamma ray data. The
distinction from decay scenarios is discsussed and we comment on the prospects
for DM production at LHC. The typical decay length $\lambda \gtrsim 10$ kpc of
the intermediate state can have its origin from a dimension six operator
suppressed by a scale $\Lambda \sim 10^{13}$ GeV, which is roughly the seesaw
scale for neutrino masses.

be launched by the central engine, with a forward jet moving toward the
observer and a receding jet (or the counter jet) moving backwardly. However, in
calculating the afterglows, usually only the emission from the forward jet is
considered. Here we present a detailed numerical study on the afterglow from
the receding jet. Our calculation is based on a generic dynamical description,
and includes some delicate ingredients such as the effect of the equal arrival
time surface. It is found that the emission from the receding jet is generally
rather weak. In radio bands, it usually peaks at a time of $t \geq 1000$ d,
with the peak flux nearly 4 orders of magnitude lower than the peak flux of the
forward jet. Also, it usually manifests as a short plateau in the total
afterglow light curve, but not as an obvious rebrightening as once expected. In
optical bands, the contribution from the receding jet is even weaker, with the
peak flux being $\sim 8$ orders of magnitude lower than the peak flux of the
forward jet. We thus argue that the emission from the receding jet is very
difficult to detect. However, in some special cases, i.e., when the
circum-burst medium density is very high, or if the parameters of the receding
jet is quite different from those of the forward jet, the emission from the
receding jet can be significantly enhanced and may still emerge as a marked
rebrightening. We suggest that the search for receding jet emission should
mostly concentrate on nearby gamma-ray bursts, and the observation campaign
should last for at least several hundred days for each event.

development of life. It is believed that pristine water is formed and grows on
the surface of icy dust grains in dark interstellar clouds. Until now, there
has been no experimental evidence whether this scenario is feasible or not on
an astrophysically relevant template and by hydrogen and oxygen atom reactions.
  Aims. We present here the first experimental evidence of water synthesis by
such a process on a realistic grain surface analogue in dense clouds, i.e.,
amorphous water ice.
  Methods. Atomic beams of oxygen and deuterium are aimed at a porous water ice
substrate (H2O) held at 10 K. Products are analyzed by the
temperature-programmed desorption technique.
  Results. We observe production of HDO and D2O, indicating that water is
formed under conditions of the dense interstellar medium from hydrogen and
oxygen atoms. This experiment opens up the field of a little explored complex
chemistry that could occur on dust grains, believed to be the site where key
processes lead to the molecular diversity and complexity observed in the
Universe.

introduce a new real-space estimator for one of the most used cosmological
statistics, the 2-point correlation function, that weights by the PDF of
individual photometric objects in a manner that is optimal when Poisson
statistics dominate. As our estimator does not bin based on the PDF peak it
substantially enhances the clustering signal by usefully incorporating
information from all photometric objects that overlap the redshift bin of
interest. As a real-world application, we measure QSO clustering in the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find that our simplest binned estimator improves
the clustering signal by a factor equivalent to increasing the survey size by a
factor of 2-3. We also introduce a new implementation that fully weights
between pairs of objects in constructing the cross-correlation and find that
this pair-weighted estimator improves clustering signal in a manner equivalent
to increasing the survey size by a factor of 4-5. Our technique uses
spectroscopic data to anchor the distance scale and it will be particularly
useful where spectroscopic data (e.g, from BOSS) overlaps deeper photometry
(e.g.,from Pan-STARRS, DES or the LSST). We additionally provide simple,
informative expressions to determine when our estimator will be competitive
with the autocorrelation of spectroscopic objects. Although we use QSOs as an
example population, our estimator can and should be applied to any clustering
estimate that uses photometric objects.

perspective on the existing BP and TRBP algorithms while observing that they
all are reductions from the basic optimization formula of $f + \sum_i h_i$
where the function $f$ is an extended-valued, strictly convex but non-smooth
and the functions $h_i$ are extended-valued functions (not necessarily convex).
We use tools from convex duality to present the ""primal-dual ascent"" algorithm

the ""norm-product"" message-passing. Special cases include sum-product and
max-product (BP algorithms) and the TRBP algorithms. When the
fractional-free-energy is set to be convex (convex-free-energy) the
norm-product is globally convergent for estimating of marginal probabilities

emerged. This field addresses a broad range of problems of significant
practical interest, namely, the recovery of a data matrix from what appears to
be incomplete, and perhaps even corrupted, information. In its simplest form,
the problem is to recover a matrix from a small sample of its entries, and
comes up in many areas of science and engineering including collaborative
filtering, machine learning, control, remote sensing, and computer vision to
name a few.
  This paper surveys the novel literature on matrix completion, which shows
that under some suitable conditions, one can recover an unknown low-rank matrix
from a nearly minimal set of entries by solving a simple convex optimization
problem, namely, nuclear-norm minimization subject to data constraints.
Further, this paper introduces novel results showing that matrix completion is
provably accurate even when the few observed entries are corrupted with a small
amount of noise. A typical result is that one can recover an unknown n x n
matrix of low rank r from just about nr log^2 n noisy samples with an error
which is proportional to the noise level. We present numerical results which
complement our quantitative analysis and show that, in practice, nuclear norm
minimization accurately fills in the many missing entries of large low-rank
matrices from just a few noisy samples. Some analogies between matrix
completion and compressed sensing are discussed throughout.

SAO51891, from photosphere to upper chromosphere, analyzing contemporaneous
high-resolution spectra and broad-band photometry. The FOCES@CAHA spectral
range is used to determine spectral classification and derive vsini and Vrad.
The Li abundance is measured to estimate the age. The BVRIJHKs bands are used
to construct the SED. The variations of our BV fluxes and Teff are used to
infer the presence of photospheric spots and observe their behavior over time.
The chromospheric activity is studied applying the spectral subtraction
technique to Halpha, CaII H&K, Heps, and CaII IRT lines. We find SAO51891 to be
a young K0-1V star with Li abundance close to the Pleiades upper envelope,
confirming its youth (~100 Myr), also inferred from its kinematical membership
to the Local Association. We detect no IR excess from SED analysis, and
rotational modulation of luminosity, Teff, CaII, and Heps total fluxes. A spot
model with two active regions, ~240 K cooler than the surrounding photosphere,
fits our light/Teff curves, and reproduces the small-amplitude Vrad variations.
The anti-correlation of light curves and chromospheric diagnostics indicates
plages spatially associated with spots. The large amplitude observed in the
Heps-flux curve suggests that this line is very sensitive to the plage
presence. Finally, SAO51891 is a young active star, lacking significant amounts
of circumstellar dust or any evidence for low mass companions. The spots turn
out to be larger and warmer than those in less active MS stars. The Vrad
variation produced by spots has an amplitude comparable with those induced by
Jupiter-mass planets orbiting close to the star. SAO51891 is a good example of
star where the detection of planets may be hampered by the high activity level.

Rydberg gases, based on the resonant coupling of Rydberg pair states to the
ionization continuum. Unlike an atomic collision where the wave functions begin
to overlap, the mechanism considered here involves only the long-range dipole
interaction and is in principle possible in a static system. It is related to
the process of intermolecular Coulombic decay (ICD). In addition, we include
the interaction-induced motion of the atoms and the effect of multi-particle
systems in this work. We find that the probability for this ionization
mechanism can be increased in many-particle systems featuring attractive or
repulsive van der Waals interactions. However, the rates for ionization through
resonant dipole coupling are very low. It is thus unlikely that this process
contributes to the autoionization of Rydberg gases in the form presented here,
but it may still act as a trigger for secondary ionization processes. As our
picture involves only binary interactions, it remains to be investigated if
collective effects of an ensemble of atoms can significantly influence the
ionization probability. Nevertheless our calculations may serve as a starting
point for the investigation of more complex systems, such as the coupling of
many pair states proposed in [Tanner et al., PRL 100, 043002 (2008)].

magnetic fields in the internetwork quiet Sun. We compare the results on the
horizontal fields with ground-based observations. We obtained 30 sec-integrated
data of quiet Sun on disc centre during a period of very good seeing. The data
have a rms noise in polarization of around 2 10^-4 of the continuum intensity.
The low noise level allowed for an inversion of the spectra. We compare the
inversion results with proxies for the determination of magnetic flux. We
confirm the presence of the horizontal fields in the quiet Sun internetwork,
with voids of some granules extent of nearly zero linear polarization signal.
Voids in the circular polarization signal are only of granular scale. More than
60 % of the surface show polarization signals above four times the rms noise
level. We find that the total magnetic flux contained in the more inclined to
horizontal fields (gamma > 45 deg) is smaller by a factor of around 2 than that
of the less inclined fields. The proxies for flux determination are seen to
suffer from a strong influence of the thermodynamic state of the atmosphere. We
suggest that the difference of the ratio of horizontal to transversal flux
between the ground-based infrared data and the satellite-based visible data is
due to the different formation heights of the respective spectral lines. We
caution that the true amount of magnetic flux cannot be derived directly from
the spectra. For purely horizontal flux, one would need its vertical extension
that has to estimated by an explicit modeling with the observed spectra as
boundary conditions, or has to be taken from MHD simulations.

$C_l^{XX}$ of cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) anisotropies and
polarizations generated by relic gravitational waves (RGWs). Three simple
models of reionization are explored, whose visibility functions are fitted by
gaussian type of functions as approximations. We have derived the analytical
polarization $\beta_l$ and temperature anisotropies $\alpha_l$, both consisting
of two terms proportional to RGWs at the decoupling and at the reionization as
well. The explicit dependence of $\beta_l$ and $\alpha_l$ upon the reionization
time $\eta_r$, the duration $\Delta\eta_r$, and the optical depth $\kappa_r$
are demonstrated. Moreover, $\beta_l$ and $\alpha_l$ contain $\kappa_r$ in
different coefficients, and the polarization spectra $C_l^{EE}$ are $C_l^{BB}$
are more sensitive probes of reionization than $C_l^{TT}$. These results
facilitate examination of the reionization effects, in particular, the
degeneracies of $\kappa_r$ with the normalization amplitude and with the
initial spectral index of RGWs. It is also found that reionization also causes
a $\kappa_r$-dependent shift $\Delta l\sim 20$ of the zero multipole $l_0$ of
$C_l^{TE}$, an effect that should be included in order to detect the traces of
RGWs. Compared with numerical results, the analytical $C_l^{XX}$ as
approximation have the limitation. For the primary peaks in the range $l\simeq
(30, 600)$, the error is $\le 3%$ in three models. In the range $l < 20$ for
the reionization bumps, the error is $\le 15%$ for $C_l^{EE}$ and $C_l^{BB}$ in
the two extended reionization models, and $C_l^{TT}$ and $C_l^{TE}$ have much
larger departures for $l<10$. The bumps in the sudden reionization model are
too low.

based on a linear equation, OF(V)=0. F is a function of some set of

invariant under a group of transformations of the Vs, homomorphic to the direct
product of the inhomogeneous Lorentz group and the internal symmetry group. In
such a theory, a state vector, denoted by a ket with group-theoretic labels,

temperature superconductors (HTSC), and more specifically the cuprate phase
diagram as a function of doping level. Yet, the only agreement seems to be that
HTSC is an example of a strongly correlated material where Coulomb repulsion
plays a major role. This manuscript proposes a model based on a Feshbach
resonance pairing mechanism and competing orders. An initial BCS-type
superconductivity at high doping is suppressed in the two particle channel by a
localized preformed pair (PP) [1] (circular density wave) creating a quantum
critical point (QCP). As doping continues to diminish, the PP then participates
in a Feshbach resonance complex that creates a new electron (hole) pair that
delocalizes and constitutes HTSC and the characteristic dome [2]. The resonant
nature of the new pair contributes to its short coherence length. The model we
propose also suggests an explanation (and necessity) for an experimentally
observed correlated lattice that could restrict energy dissipation to enable
the resonant Cooper pair to move over several correlation lengths, or
essentially free. The PP density wave is responsible for the pseudogap as it
appears as a localized superconductor since its density of states and
quasiparticle spectrum are similar to those of a superconductor
(Peierls-Frolich theory), but with no phase coherence between the PP.

energy budget is enough to explain observed GRBs. We calculate models of spinar
evolution using results from a population synthesis of binary systems (done by
the `Scenario Machine') as initial parameters for the rotating massive cores.

precursor, are identified, and the precursor-to-main-pulse time separations
fully agree with the range of the observed values. The calculated fraction of
long GRBs with precursor (about 10 per cent of the total number of long GRBs)
and the durations of the main pulses are also consistent with observations.
Precursors with lead times greater by up to one order of magnitude than those

establish the asymptotic normality of the Whittle estimator under mild

GARCH-type innovations. To cover nonstationary fractionally integrated
processes, we extend the idea of Abadir, Distaso and Giraitis (2007, Journal of
Econometrics 141, 1353-1384) and develop the nonstationarity-extended Whittle
estimation. The resulting estimator is shown to be asymptotically normal and is
more efficient than the tapered Whittle estimator. Finally, the results from a
small simulation study are presented to corroborate our theoretical findings.

evaporation. These abundance constraints can be used to constrain the
primordial power spectrum, and hence models of inflation, on scales far smaller
than those probed by cosmological observations. We compile, and where relevant
update, the constraints on the abundance of PBHs before calculating the
constraints on the curvature perturbation, taking into account the growth of
density perturbations prior to horizon entry. We consider two simple
parameterizations of the curvature perturbation spectrum on the scale of
interest: constant and power-law. The constraints from PBHs on the amplitude of
the power spectrum are typically in the range 10^{-2}-10^{-1} with some scale
dependence.

By adjusting the parameters of the corresponding Bose-Hubbard (BH) Hamiltonian
the deviation between the numerical energy spectrum and the BH spectrum is
minimized. This defines the optimal BH parameter set which we compare to the
standard parameters of the BH model. The range of validity of the BH model with
these parameter sets is examined, and an improved analytical prediction of the
interaction parameter is introduced. Furthermore, an extended BH model and
implications due to the energy dependence of the scattering length and

low-energy QCD may be formulated as a 5-dimensional field theory in the weak
coupling regime in which the fifth coordinate plays a role of inverse energy
scale. Taking the point of view that this is just an efficient parametrization
of the non-perturbative dynamics of strong interactions, we discuss on a
qualitative level an alternative possibility for a simpler 5-dimensional
parametrization of main phenomena in the low-energy QCD. We propose to
interpret the effect of chiral symmetry breaking as an effective appearance of
compactified extra dimension with the radius of the order of inverse scale of
chiral symmetry breaking. Following some heuristic arguments two dual scenarios
for the emergence of the excited light mesons are introduced: In the first
scenario, the meson resonances are interpreted as the effects of Kaluza-Klein
excitations of quarks inside mesons, in the second one, as the formation of
gluon strings wound around the compactified dimension an appropriate number of
times. Matching of these scenarios permits to express the slope of radial Regge
trajectories through the order parameters of the chiral symmetry breaking, with
the compactification radius being excluded. This example shows qualitatively
that the extra dimension may play an auxiliary role providing a short way for
deriving new relations.

electrodynamics; and with: (ii) the problem of the four-position and
four-momentum operators, each one with its hermitian and anti-hermitian parts,
for relativistic spin-zero particles. Afterwards, other physically important
applications of non-selfadjoint (and even non-hermitian) operators are
discussed: In particular, (iii) we reanalyze in detail the interesting
possibility of associating quasi-hermitian Hamiltonians with (decaying)
unstable states in nuclear physics. Finally, we briefly mention the cases of
quantum dissipation, as well as of the nuclear optical potential. [PACS
