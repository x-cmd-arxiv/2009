that often seem hard to reconcile with one another. In this paper we show how
many of these diverse phenomena can be synthesized into a single coherent
theoretical picture. Specifically we present a description where a pseudogap
and gapless Fermi arcs exist in the normal state above the superconducting
transition temperature ($T_c$), but give way to the observed quantum
oscillations and other phenomena at low temperature when the superconductivity
is suppressed by a magnetic field. We show the consistency between these
phenomena and observations of enhanced Nernst and diamagnetic signals above
$T_c$. We also develop a description of the vortex core inside the
superconducting state and discuss its relation with the high field phenomena.

thereby enabling the study of crossovers between a number of Fermi-liquid (FL)

state is of NFL type. In the case of Anderson impurities, we consider the
transport properties of three coupled quantum dots. This class of models
includes as limiting cases the familiar serial double quantum dot and triple
quantum dot nanostructures. By extracting the quasiparticle scattering phase
shifts, we compute the low-temperature conductance as a function of the
inter-impurity tunneling-coupling. We point out that due to the existence of
exponentially low temperature scales, there is a parameter range where the
stable ""zero-temperature"" fixed point is essentially never reached (not even in
numerical renormalization group calculations). The ""zero-temperature""
conductance is then of no interest and it may only be meaningful to compute the
conductance at finite temperature. This illustrates the perils of studying the

explanations of many high energy anomalies, including PAMELA, ATIC, and the

are automatically present in such theories, these models naturally explain the
DAMA/LIBRA and INTEGRAL signals through the inelastic dark matter (iDM) and
exciting dark matter (XDM) scenarios, respectively. Interestingly, with only
weak kinetic mixing to hypercharge to mediate decays, the lifetime of excited
states with delta < 2 m_e is longer than the age of the universe. The
fractional relic abundance of these excited states depends on the temperature
of kinetic decoupling, but can be appreciable. There could easily be other
mechanisms for rapid decay, but the consequences of such long-lived states are
intriguing. We find that CDMS constrains the fractional relic population of
~100 keV states to be <~ 10^-2, for a 1 TeV WIMP with sigma_n = 10^-40 cm^2.
Upcoming searches at CDMS, as well as xenon, silicon, and argon targets, can
push this limit significantly lower. We also consider the possibility that the
DAMA excitation occurs from a metastable state into the XDM state, which decays
via e+e- emission, which allows lighter states to explain the INTEGRAL signal
due to the small kinetic energies required. Such models yield dramatic signals
from down-scattering, with spectra peaking at high energies, sometimes as high
as ~1 MeV, well outside the usual search windows. Such signals would be visible
at future Ar and Si experiments, and may be visible at Ge and Xe experiments.
We also consider other XDM models involving ~ 500 keV metastable states, and
find they can allow lighter WIMPs to explain INTEGRAL as well.

of six carbon-rich AGB stars in the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy (Sgr

observed C$_2$H$_2$ and SiC features are very similar to those observed in
Galactic AGB stars. The metallicities are estimated from an empirical relation
between the acetylene optical depth and the strength of the SiC feature. The
metallicities are higher than those of the LMC, and close to Galactic values.
While the high metallicity could imply an age of around 1 Gyr, for the dusty
AGB stars, the pulsation periods suggest ages in excess of 2 or 3 Gyr. We fit
the spectra of the observed stars using the DUSTY radiative transfer model and
determine their dust mass-loss rates to be in the range 1.0--3.3$\times 10^{-8}

located at the far side of the solar circle, beyond the Galactic Centre. One of

The nuclear wave functions are derived from the J-matrix inverse scattering
nucleon-nucleon potential (JISP), and the Schroedinger equation is solved using
the hyperspherical-harmonics expansion. Our calculation brings the theoretical
decay-rate within 3% of the measured one. This success is attributed to the use
of chiral-perturbation-theory based mesonic currents, whose contribution is
qualitatively different compared to standard nuclear physics approach, where
the use of meson exchange currents worsens the comparison to experiment. The
inherent inconsistency in the use of the JISP potential together with
chiral-perturbation-theory based is argued not to affect this conclusion,
though a more detailed investigation is called for. We conclude that any
suppression of the axial constant in nuclear matter is included in this
description of the weak interaction in the nucleus.

addition this link enables us to extend the theorem to a more general
ellipsoidal volume. Unfortunately one can only prove the existence of the
depolarizing tensor in this way and one still needs another method for actually

(-N=N-) bridge on the one hand and the surface interaction of the two
closed-shell phenyl (-C6H5) rings on the other. With respect to this factor the
cis conformer exhibits a more favorable gas-phase geometric structure and is
thus more stabilized at the studied surfaces. With the overall binding still
rather weak the relative stability of the two isomers is thereby reduced at
Ag(111) and Au(111). This is significantly different at Cu(111), where the cis
bonding is strong enough to even reverse the gas-phase energetic order at the
level of the employed semi-local electronic exchange and correlation (xc)
functional. While this actual reversal may well be affected by the deficiencies
due to the approximate xc treatment, we critically discuss that the
rationalization of the general effect of the surface on the meta-stable
molecular states is quite robust. This should equally hold for the presented

that removes local entanglement and coarse grain the lattice, we show that the
resulting renormalization flow of the tensors in the tensor network has a nice
fixed-point structure. The isolated fixed-point tensors $T_{inv}$ plus the
symmetry group $G_{sym}$ of the tensors (i.e. the symmetry group of the
Lagrangian) characterize various phases of the system. Such a characterization
can describe both the symmetry breaking phases and topological phases, as
illustrated by 2D statistical Ising model, 2D statistical loop gas model, and
1+1D quantum spin-1/2 and spin-1 models. In particular, using such a $(G_{sym},
T_{inv}) $ characterization, we show that the Haldane phase for a spin-1 chain
is a phase protected by the time-reversal, parity, and translation symmetries.
Thus the Haldane phase is a symmetry protected topological phase. The
$(G_{sym}, T_{inv})$ characterization is more general than the
characterizations based on the boundary spins and string order parameters. The
tensor renormalization approach also allows us to study continuous phase
transitions between symmetry breaking phases and/or topological phases. The
scaling dimensions and the central charges for the critical points that
describe those continuous phase transitions can be calculated from the
fixed-point tensors at those critical points.

likely to be vastly smaller than the network itself. However, Fortunato and
Barth\'{e}lemy have proved that modularity maximization algorithms for
community detection may fail to resolve communities with fewer than
$\sqrt{L/2}$ edges, where $L$ is the number of edges in the entire network.
This resolution limit leads modularity maximization algorithms to have
notoriously poor accuracy on many real networks. Fortunato and Barth\'{e}lemy's
argument can be extended to networks with weighted edges as well, and we derive
this corollary argument. We conclude that weighted modularity algorithms may
fail to resolve communities with fewer than $\sqrt{W \epsilon/2}$ total edge
weight, where $W$ is the total edge weight in the network and $\epsilon$ is the
maximum weight of an inter-community edge. If $\epsilon$ is small, then small
communities can be resolved.
  Given a weighted or unweighted network, we describe how to derive new edge
weights in order to achieve a low $\epsilon$, we modify the ``CNM'' community
detection algorithm to maximize weighted modularity, and show that the
resulting algorithm has greatly improved accuracy. In experiments with an
emerging community standard benchmark, we find that our simple CNM variant is
competitive with the most accurate community detection methods yet proposed.

through the background of a weakly-coupled quark-gluon plasma, it is known how
to reduce this problem to an equivalent problem in non-relativistic
two-dimensional quantum mechanics. Analytic solutions, however, have always
resorted to further approximations. One is a harmonic oscillator approximation
to the corresponding quantum mechanics problem, which is appropriate for
sufficiently thick media. Another is to formally treat the particle as having
only a single significant scattering from the plasma (known as the N=1 term of
the opacity expansion), which is appropriate for sufficiently thin media. In a
broad range of intermediate cases, these two very different approximations give
surprisingly similar but slightly differing results if one works to leading
logarithmic order in the particle energy, and there has been confusion about
the range of validity of each approximation. In this paper, I sort out in
detail the parametric range of validity of these two approximations at leading
logarithmic order. For simplicity, I study the problem for small alpha_s and

this requires a dedicated space mission like JDEM. SNe Ia are mature
cosmological probes --- their limitations are well characterized, and a path to
improvement is clear. Dominant systematic errors include photometric
calibration, selection effects, reddening, and population-dependent
differences. Building on past lessons, well-controlled new surveys are poised
to make strides in these areas: the Palomar Transient Factory, Skymapper, La
Silla QUEST, Pan-STARRS, the Dark Energy Survey, LSST, and JDEM. They will
obviate historical calibrations and selection biases, and allow comparisons via
large subsamples. Some systematics follow from our ignorance of SN Ia
progenitors, which there is hope of determining with SN Ia rate studies from
0<z<4.
  Aside from cosmology, SNe Ia regulate galactic and cluster chemical
evolution, inform stellar evolution, and are laboratories for extreme physics.
Essential probes of SNe Ia in these contexts include spectroscopy from the UV
to the IR, X-ray cluster and SN remnant observations, spectropolarimetry, and
advanced theoretical studies. While there are an abundance of discovery
facilities planned, there is a deficit of follow-up resources. Living in the

from taking the limit \mu\to\infty. This drawback is absent in the M model

derive the heterotic string (the string world-sheet theory is a heterotic

extra right-handed fermion coupled to the fermion fields of the N=(2,2) CP(N-1)

relate parameters of the microscopic M model to those of the world-sheet

  I begin with the fundamental theory of gyrokinetics, and a novel formulation
of its extension to the equations for mean-scale transport -- the equations
which must be solved to determine the performance of magnetically confined
fusion devices. The second project presents gyrokinetic secondary instability
theory as a mechanism to bring about saturation of the basic instabilities that
drive gyrokinetic turbulence. Emphasis is put on the ability for this analytic
theory to predict basic properties of the nonlinear state, which can be applied
to a mixing length phenomenology of transport. The final project is an
application of the methods from inertial range understanding of fluid
turbulence, to describe the stationary state of fully developed two-dimensional
gyrokinetic turbulence. This work explores the relatively new idea of a
phase-space cascade, whereby fine scales are nonlinearly generated in both
position space and velocity space, and ultimately smoothed by collisional
entropy production. This process constitutes the thermodynamic balance which
occurs in the true steady state of a turbulent plasma, including those found in
fusion devices.

information on galaxy evolution and growth of structure in the Universe. While
clusters have received appreciable attention in this regard, the role of groups
as fundamental to formation of the present day galaxy population has remained
relatively unaddressed. Here we present stellar ages, metallicities and
alpha-element abundances derived using Lick indices for 67 spectroscopically
confirmed members of the NGC 5044 galaxy group with the aim of shedding light
on galaxy evolution in the context of the group environment.
  We find that galaxies in the NGC 5044 group show evidence for a strong
relationship between stellar mass and metallicity, consistent with their
counterparts in both higher and lower mass groups and clusters. Galaxies show
no clear trend of age or alpha-element abundance with mass, but these data form
a tight sequence when fit simultaneously in age, metallicity and stellar mass.
In the context of the group environment, our data support the tidal disruption
of low-mass galaxies at small group-centric radii, as evident from an apparent
lack of galaxies below ~10^9 M_sun within ~100 kpc of the brightest group
galaxy. Using a joint analysis of absorption- and emission-line metallicities,
we are able to show that the star-forming galaxy population in the NGC 5044
group appears to require gas removal to explain the ~1.5 dex offset between
absorption- and emission-line metallicities observed in some cases. A
comparison with other stellar population properties suggests that this gas
removal is dominated by galaxy interactions with the hot intragroup medium.

algorithms (e.g. Berlind et al. 2006, Tago et al. 2008) miss this type of
structures. Using the SDSS-5 spectroscopic data and the photometric redshifts
derived in D'Abrusco et al. 2007, we identified possible group members in
photometric redshift space and derived, for each group, several individual
properties. We also combined pointed and stacked Rosat All Sky Survey data to
investigate the X-ray luminosities of these systems. Our study confirms that
the majority of groups are physical entities with richness in the range 3--13
galaxies, and properties ranging between those of loose and compact groups. We
confirm that SHK groups are richer in early-type galaxies than the surrounding
environment and the field, as expected from the morphology-density relation and
from the selection of groups of red galaxies. Furthermore, our work supports
the existence of two sub-classes of structures, the first one being formed by
compact and isolated groups and the second formed by extended structures. We
suggest that while the first class of objects dwells in less dense regions like
the outer parts of clusters or the field, possibly sharing the properties of
Hickson Compact Groups, the more extended structures represent a mixture of
[core+halo] configurations and cores of rich clusters. X-ray luminosities for
SHKs are generally consistent with these results and with the expectations for
the L_X-sigma_v relation, but also suggest the velocity dispersions reported in
literature are underestimated for some of the richest systems.

of as multiphase exploitation of multiple objective-/value-restricted

review recent progress in our understanding of the interactions of charm and
bottom quarks in the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). For individual heavy quarks, we
focus on elastic interactions for which the large quark mass enables a Brownian
motion treatment. This opens a unique access to thermalization mechanisms for
heavy quarks at low momentum, and thus to their transport coefficients in the
quark-gluon fluid. Different approaches to evaluate heavy-quark diffusion are
discussed and compared, including perturbative QCD, effective potential models
utilizing input from lattice QCD and string-theoretic estimates in conformal
field theories. Applications to heavy-quark observables in heavy-ion collisions
are realized via relativistic Langevin simulations, where we illustrate the
important role of a realistic medium evolution to quantitatively extract the
heavy-quark diffusion constant. In the heavy quarkonium sector, we briefly
review the current status in potential-model based interpretations of
correlation functions computed in lattice QCD, followed by an evaluation of
quarkonium dissociation reactions in the QGP. The discussion of the
phenomenology in heavy-ion reactions focuses on thermal model frameworks
paralleling the open heavy-flavor sector. We also emphasize connections to the

quantitative model of grain alignment that can account for the observed

quantitative predictions of the radiative torque mechanism, which is currently
accepted as the dominant mechanism of grain alignment, open avenues to tracing
magnetic fields in various astrophysical environments, including diffuse and
dense interstellar gas, molecular clouds, circumstellar environments, accretion
disks, comet tails, Zodiacal dust etc. At the same time, measurements of the
absolute value of polarization and its variations can, in addition, provide
unique information about the dust composition and dust environment. In the
review I describe the analytical model describing well radiative torques acting
on irregular grains and discuss how the alignment induced by radiative torques
varies in the presence of superparamagnetic inclusions and pinwheel torques,
e.g. arising from the molecular hydrogen formation over grain surface. I also
describe observations that can establish whether grains are superparamagnetic
and whether recoils from molecular hydrogen formations are powerful enough to
give rise to substantial uncompensated torques. Answering to these questions
should allow for reliable modeling of astrophysical polarization with numerous
important applications, from accounting for dust contribution in Cosmic
Microwave Background polarization studies to obtaining magnetic field strength

AUs (Lecavelier des Etangs et al. 1994, 1995, 1997; Lamers et al. 1997).
Recently, a candidate planet has been identified by imagery in the
circumstellar disk of Beta Pictoris (Lagrange et al. 2009). This planet, named
Beta Pic b, is observed at a projected distance of 8AU from the central star.
It is therefore a plausible candidate for the photometric event observed in
1981. The coincidence of the observed position of the planet in November 2003
and the calculated position assuming that the 1981 transit is due to a planet
orbiting at 8 AU is intriguing. Assuming that the planet that is detected on
the image is the same as the object transiting in November 1981, we estimate
ranges of possible orbital distances and periods. In the favored scenario, the
planet orbits at about 8 AU and was seen close to its quadrature position in
the 2003 images. In this case, most of the uncertainties are related to error
bars on the position in 2003. Uncertainties related to the stellar mass and
orbital eccentricity are also discussed. We find a semi-major axis in the range
[7.6-8.7] AU and an orbital period in the range [15.9-19.5] years. We give
predictions for imaging observations at quadrature in the southwest branch of

0.15<z<0.3. A weak-lensing signal is detected at high statistical significance
in each cluster, the total detection S/N ranging from 5 to 13. In this paper we
concentrate on fitting spherical models to the tangential distortion profiles
of the clusters. When the models are fitted to the clusters individually, we
are unable to discriminate statistically between SIS and NFW models. However
when the tangential distortion profiles of the individual clusters are
combined, and models fitted to the stacked profile, the SIS model is rejected
at 6- and 11-sigma, respectively, for low- and high-mass bins. We also use the
individual cluster NFW model fits to investigate the relationship between
cluster mass (M_vir) and concentration (c_vir), finding an anti-correlation of
c_vir and M_vir. The best-fit c_vir-M_vir relation is: c_vir(M_vir) propto
M_vir^{-alpha} with alpha=0.41+/-0.19 -- i.e. a non-zero slope is detected at
2sigma significance. We then investigate the optimal radius within which to
measure cluster mass, finding that the typical fractional errors are improved
to sigma(M_Delta)/M_Delta ~ 0.1-0.2 for cluster masses at higher over-densities
Delta=500-2000, from 0.2-0.3 for the virial over-density (~110). Further
comparisons between mass measurements based on spherical model fitting and the
model-independent aperture mass method reveal that the 2D aperture mass
enclosed within a cylinder of a given aperture radius is systematically greater
than the 3D spherical mass obtained from NFW model fitting: M_2D/M_3D= 1.34 and
1.40 for Delta=500 and 110, respectively. The amplitude of this effect agrees
well with that predicted by integrating the NFW model along the line-of-sight.

Souradeep. We show how the inclusion of polarisation measurements can decrease
the uncertainty in the reconstructed power spectrum. In particular, the
polarisation data can constrain oscillations in the spectrum more effectively
than total intensity only measurements. We apply the estimator to a compilation
of current CMB results. The reconstructed spectrum is consistent with the
best-fit power spectrum although we find evidence for a `dip' in the power on
scales k ~ 0.002 Mpc^-1. This feature appears to be associated with the WMAP
power in the region 18 < l < 26 which is consistently below best--fit models.
We also forecast the reconstruction for a simulated, Planck-like survey
including sample variance limited polarisation data.

magnetic equilibria in stars, consisting of both poloidal and toroidal magnetic

current is a function of the poloidal magnetic flux only, and thus should
vanish on field lines extending outside of the star. Non-zero poloidal current
is limited to a set of toroid-shape flux surfaces fully enclosed inside the
star. If we demand that there are no current sheets, then on the separatrix
delineating the regions of zero and finite toroidal magnetic field both the
poloidal flux function and its derivative should match. Thus, for a given
magnetic field in the bulk of the star, the elliptical Grad-Shafranov equation
that describes magnetic field structure inside the toroid is an ill-posed
problem, with both Dirichlet and Newman boundary conditions and {\it a priori}
unknown distribution of toroidal and poloidal electric currents. We discuss a
procedure which allows to solve this ill-posed problem by adjusting the unknown
current functions. We find a poloidal current-carrying solution that leaves the
shape of the flux function and, correspondingly, the toroidal component of the
electric current the same as in the case of no poloidal current. The equilibria
discussed in this paper may have arbitrary large toroidal magnetic field, and
may include a set of stable equilibria. The method developed here can also be
applied to magnetic structure of differentially rotating stars, as well as to
calculate velocity field in incompressible isolated fluid vortex with a swirl.

Spitzer Space Telescope enable us to study the mid-infrared dust excess of
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in the LMC. This is the first time we can
quantitatively assess the gas and dust input from AGB stars over a complete
galaxy, fully based on observations. The integrated mass-loss rate over all
intermediate and high mass-loss rate carbon-rich AGB candidates in the LMC is
8.5x10^-3 solar mass per year, up to 2.1x10^-2 solar mass per year. This number
could be increased up to 2.7x10^-2 solar mass per year, if oxygen-rich stars
are included. This is overall consistent with theoretical expectations,
considering the star formation rate when these low- and intermediate-mass stars
where formed, and the initial mass functions. AGB stars are one of the most
important gas sources in the LMC, with supernovae (SNe), which produces about
2-4x10^-2 solar mass per year. At the moment, the star formation rate exceeds
the gas feedback from AGB stars and SNe in the LMC, and the current star
formation depends on gas already present in the ISM. This suggests that as the
gas in the ISM is exhausted, the star formation rate will eventually decline in
the LMC, unless gas is supplied externally. Our estimates suggest `a missing
dust-mass problem' in the LMC, which is similarly found in high-z galaxies: the
accumulated dust mass from AGB stars and possibly SNe over the dust life time
(400--800 Myrs) is significant less than the dust mass in the ISM. Another dust
source is required, possibly related to star-forming regions.

ratio alpha between the number of data instances seen by a single teacher, and
the number of classes. We suggest several algorithms for the distributed
labeling problem, and analyze their efficiency as a function of alpha. In
addition, we provide an upper bound on label efficiency for the case of
completely uncoordinated teachers, and show that efficiency approaches 0 as the
ratio between the number of labels each teacher provides and the number of
classes drops (i.e. alpha goes to 0).

regularized, massless gauge-theory scattering amplitudes with an arbitrary
number of legs and loops. It follows from an all-order conjecture for the
anomalous-dimension matrix of n-jet operators in soft-collinear effective
theory. We show that the form of this anomalous dimension is severely
constrained by soft-collinear factorization, non-abelian exponentiation, and
the behavior of amplitudes in collinear limits. Using a diagrammatic analysis,
we demonstrate that these constraints imply that to three-loop order the
anomalous dimension involves only two-parton correlations, with the possible
exception of a single color structure multiplying a function of conformal cross
ratios depending on the momenta of four external partons, which would have to
vanish in all two-particle collinear limits. We argue that such a function does
not appear at three-loop order, and that the same is true in higher orders. Our
formula predicts Casimir scaling of the cusp anomalous dimension to all orders
in perturbation theory, and we explicitly check that the constraints exclude
the appearance of higher Casimir invariants at four loops. Using known results
for the quark and gluon form factors, we derive the three-loop coefficients of
the 1/epsilon^n pole terms (with n=1,...,6) for an arbitrary n-parton
scattering amplitude in massless QCD. This generalizes Catani's two-loop
formula proposed in 1998.

coordinates of these sources have allowed us to find optical counterparts for
59 of them, yielding a reduced sample of 60 optically obscured post-AGB star

  Computing","22 pages, 1 figure",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, several claims have been made that certain fundamental problems of
distributed computing, including Leader Election and Distributed Consensus,
begin to admit feasible and efficient solutions when the model of distributed
computation is extended so as to apply quantum processing. This has been
achieved in one of two distinct ways: (1) by initializing the system in a
quantum entangled state, and/or (2) by applying quantum communication channels.
In this paper, we explain why some of these prior claims are misleading, in the
sense that they rely on changes to the model unrelated to quantum processing.
On the positive side, we consider the aforementioned quantum extensions when
applied to Linial's well-established LOCAL model of distributed computing.
  For both types of extensions, we put forward valid proof-of-concept examples
of distributed problems whose round complexity is in fact reduced through
genuinely quantum effects, in contexts which do not depend on the anonymity of
nodes.
  Finally, we show that even the quantum variants of the LOCAL model have
non-trivial limitations, captured by a very simple (purely probabilistic)
notion which we call ""physical locality"" (PLOCAL). While this is strictly
weaker than the ""computational locality"" of the classical LOCAL model, it
nevertheless implies that for many distributed combinatorial optimization
problems, such as Maximal Independent Set, the best currently known lower time
bounds cannot be broken by applying quantum processing, in any conceivable way.

hot gas in the Virgo cluster resulting from intermittent cavities formed with

depositing about 85 solar masses per year of cold gas in the cluster core --
such uninhibited cooling conflicts with X-ray spectra and many other
observations. When cosmic rays are produced or deposited 10 kpc from the
cluster center in bursts of about 10^{59} ergs lasting 20 Myrs and spaced at
intervals of 200 Myrs, the central cooling rate is greatly reduced to 0.1 - 1
solar masses per year, consistent with observations. After cosmic rays diffuse
through the cavity walls, the ambient gas density is reduced and is buoyantly
transported 30-70 kpc out into the cluster. Cosmic rays do not directly heat
the gas and the modest shock heating around young cavities is offset by global
cooling as the cluster gas expands. After several Gyrs the hot gas density and
temperature profiles remain similar to those observed, provided the
time-averaged cosmic ray luminosity is about 10^{43} erg/s, approximately equal
to the bolometric X-ray luminosity within only 56 kpc. If an appreciable

the complexity of determining when we can terminate eliciting preferences, and
prove that the complexity depends on the elicitation strategy. We show, for
instance, that it may be better from a computational perspective to elicit all
preferences from one agent at a time than to elicit individual preferences from
multiple agents. We also study the connection between the strategic
manipulation of an election and preference elicitation. We show that what we
can manipulate affects the computational complexity of manipulation. In
particular, we prove that there are voting rules which are easy to manipulate
if we can change all of an agent's vote, but computationally intractable if we
can change only some of their preferences. This suggests that, as with
preference elicitation, a fine-grained view of manipulation may be informative.

where it is computationally difficult to decide the probability of a candidate
winning given a probability distribution over the votes.

constraint programming. To reduce search, fast algorithms associated with each
constraint prune the domains of variables. With global (or non-binary)
constraints, the cost of such propagation may be much greater than the
quadratic cost for binary constraints. We therefore study the computational
complexity of reasoning with global constraints. We first characterise a number
of important questions related to constraint propagation. We show that such
questions are intractable in general, and identify dependencies between the
tractability and intractability of the different questions. We then demonstrate
how the tools of computational complexity can be used in the design and
analysis of specific global constraints. In particular, we illustrate how
computational complexity can be used to determine when a lesser level of local
consistency should be enforced, when constraints can be safely generalized,
when decomposing constraints will reduce the amount of pruning, and when
combining constraints is tractable.

(CTAP), this method provides a robust way to transfer quantum information
encoded in the electronic spin across a chain of quantum dots or donors. Using
large scale atomistic tight-binding simulations involving over 3.5 million
atoms, we verify the existence of a CTAP pathway in a realistic solid-state
system: gated triple donors in silicon. Realistic gate profiles from commercial
tools were combined with tight-binding methods to simulate gate control of the
donor to donor tunnel barriers in the presence of cross-talk. As CTAP is an
adiabatic protocol, it can be analyzed by solving the time independent problem
at various stages of the pulse - justifying the use of time-independent
tight-binding methods to this problem. Our results show that a three donor CTAP
transfer, with inter-donor spacing of 15 nm can occur on timescales greater
than 23 ps, well within experimentally accessible regimes. The method not only

we employ the Trend Filtering Algorithm (TFA) on a subset of the MACHO database
and search for variable stars. TFA has been applied successfully in planetary
transit searches, where weak, short-lasting periodic dimmings are sought in the
presence of noise and various systematics (due to, e.g., imperfect flat
fielding, crowding, etc). These latter effects introduce colored noise in the
photometric time series that can lead to a complete miss of the signal. By
using a large number of available photometric time series of a given field, TFA
utilizes the fact that the same types of systematics appear in several/many
time series of the same field. As a result, we fit each target time series by a
(least-square-sense) optimum linear combination of templates and
frequency-analyze the residuals. Once a signal is found, we reconstruct the
signal by employing the full model, including the signal, systematics and
noise. We apply TFA on the brightest ~5300 objects from subsets of each of the
MACHO Large Magellanic Cloud fields #1 and #79. We find that the Fourier
frequency analysis performed on the original data detect some 60% of the
objects as trend-dominated. This figure decreases essentially to zero after
using TFA. Altogether, We detect 387 variables in the two fields, 183 of which
would have remained undetected without using TFA. Where possible, we give
preliminary classification of the variables found.

visible light, infrared waves and microwaves. In such a metamaterial, an
electromagnetic wave propagates so that the direction of its energy flow is

refractive index being negative. Here we show that a thin film comprising
parallel tilted nanorods deposited by directing silver vapor obliquely towards
a large-area substrate displays a negative real refractive index in the visible

thin films in the photonics industry, our result is promising for large-scale

representation as Kolmogorov or algorithmic complexity in the cognitive
sciences. The discussion is based on two premises: 1) all human experience is
generated in the brain, 2) the brain has only access to information. Taken
together, these two premises lead us to conclude that all the elements of what
we call `reality' are derived mental constructs based on information and
compression, i.e., algorithmic models derived from the search for simplicity in
data. Naturally, these premises apply to humans in real or virtual environments
as well as robots or other cognitive systems. Based on this, it is further
hypothesized that there is a hierarchy of processing levels where simplicity
and compression play a major role. As applications, I illustrate first the
relevance of compression and simplicity in fundamental neuroscience with an
analysis of the Mismatch Negativity paradigm. Then I discuss the applicability
to Presence research, which studies how to produce real-feeling experiences in
mediated interaction, and use Bayesian modeling to define in a formal way
different aspects of the illusion of Presence. The idea is put forth that given
alternative models (interpretations) for a given mediated interaction, a brain
will select the simplest one it can construct weighted by prior models. In the
final section the universality of these ideas and applications in robotics,
machine learning, biology and education is discussed. I emphasize that there is
a common conceptual thread based on the idea of simplicity, which suggests a
common study approach.

and $E$ is the set of edges. A $b$-dimensional cube is a Cartesian product
$I_1\times I_2\times...\times I_b$, where each $I_i$ is a closed interval of
unit length on the real line. The \emph{cubicity} of $G$, denoted by $\cub(G)$
is the minimum positive integer $b$ such that the vertices in $G$ can be mapped
to axis parallel $b$-dimensional cubes in such a way that two vertices are
adjacent in $G$ if and only if their assigned cubes intersect. Suppose $S(m)$
denotes a star graph on $m+1$ nodes. We define \emph{claw number} $\psi(G)$ of
the graph to be the largest positive integer $m$ such that $S(m)$ is an induced
subgraph of $G$. It can be easily shown that the cubicity of any graph is at
least $\ceil{\log_2\psi(G)}$.
  In this paper, we show that, for an interval graph $G$
$\ceil{\log_2\psi(G)}\le\cub(G)\le\ceil{\log_2\psi(G)}+2$. Till now we are
unable to find any interval graph with $\cub(G)>\ceil{\log_2\psi(G)}$. We also
show that, for an interval graph $G$, $\cub(G)\le\ceil{\log_2\alpha}$, where
$\alpha$ is the independence number of $G$. Therefore, in the special case of
$\psi(G)=\alpha$, $\cub(G)$ is exactly $\ceil{\log_2\alpha}$.
  The concept of cubicity can be generalized by considering boxes instead of
cubes. A $b$-dimensional box is a Cartesian product $I_1\times
I_2\times...\times I_b$, where each $I_i$ is a closed interval on the real
line. The \emph{boxicity} of a graph, denoted $ box(G)$, is the minimum $k$
such that $G$ is the intersection graph of $k$-dimensional boxes. It is clear
that $ box(G)\le\cub(G)$. From the above result, it follows that for any graph
$G$, $\cub(G)\le box(G)\ceil{\log_2\alpha}$.

are known to cause observable variability on orbital timescales. The horizontal
perturbations of the surface velocity fields are referred to as ""tidal flows"".
In this paper we illustrate the manner in which tidal flows perturb the surface
velocity field from that of uniform rotation, using a one-layer stellar model
for the calculations. We justify the validity of this simplified model by the
striking similarity between the photospheric absorption line-profiles it
predicts and observational data of the binary system alpha Virginis. The
velocity perturbations are used to compute the mechanical energy dissipation
rates, dot-E, due to the shearing flows for the case of a massive (50+28 Mo)
binary system having a moderately eccentric (e=0.3) orbit. The largest value of
dot-E around periastron phases is found on the hemisphere facing the companion.
However, at other orbital phases the maximum dot-E may migrate towards the
poles. Assuming that dot-E plays a role in the mass-loss characteristics of
massive binary systems, this suggests that peculiar binaries such as HD 5980
and eta Carinae may have a highly non-spherically symmetric mass-loss
distribution which, in addition, is time-variable.

obtained by H. Imamura {\em et al.} (2004) and J. Malecki (2007). Using our
findings we then explore the effect from spin-orbit interactions on the
non-Fermi liquid quantum critical transition between the RKKY-singlet and
Kondo-screened RKKY-triplet states. We argue that spin-orbit interactions under
certain conditions produce a line of critical points exhibiting the same
leading scaling behavior as that of the ordinary TIKM. In the second part of
the paper we shift focus and turn to the question of how spin-orbit
interactions affect the entanglement between two localized RKKY-coupled spins
in the parameter regime where the competition from the direct Kondo interaction
can be neglected. Using data for a device with two spinful quantum dots
patterned in a gated InAs heterostructure we show that a gate-controlled
spin-orbit interaction may drive a maximally entangled state to one with
vanishing entanglement, or vice versa (as measured by the concurrence). This
has important implications for proposals using RKKY interactions for nonlocal

of molecules in regions of high mass star formation. We observed five prominent
sites of high mass star formation in HCN, HNC, HCO+, their isotopes, C18O, C34S
and some other molecular lines, for some sources both at 3 and 1.3 mm and in
continuum at 1.3 mm. Taking into account earlier obtained data for N2H+ we
derive molecular abundances and physical parameters of the sources (mass,
density, ionization fraction, etc.). The kinetic temperature is estimated from
CH3C2H observations. Then we analyze correlations between molecular abundances
and physical parameters and discuss chemical models applicable to these
species. The typical physical parameters for the sources in our sample are the
following: kinetic temperature in the range ~ 30-50 K (it is systematically
higher than that obtained from ammonia observations and is rather close to dust
temperature), masses from tens to hundreds solar masses, gas densities ~ 10^5
cm^{-3}, ionization fraction ~ 10^{-7}. In most cases the ionization fraction
slightly (a few times) increases towards the embedded YSOs. The observed clumps
are close to gravitational equilibrium. There are systematic differences in
distributions of various molecules. The abundances of CO, CS and HCN are more
or less constant. There is no sign of CO and/or CS depletion as in cold cores.
At the same time the abundances of HCO+, HNC and especially N2H+ strongly vary
in these objects. They anti-correlate with the ionization fraction and as a
result decrease towards the embedded YSOs. For N2H+ this can be explained by

between two spatially separated atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) via the
technique of the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). Two strong
coupling laser beams and two entangled probe laser beams are used to make two
distant BECs be in EIT states and to generate an atom-photon entangled state
between probe lasers and distant BECs. The two BECs are initially in
un-entangled product coherent states while the probe lasers are initially in an
entangled state. Entangled states of two distant BECs can be created through
performing projective measurements upon the two outgoing probe lasers under
certain conditions. Concretely, we propose two protocols to show how to
generate entangled coherent states of the two distant BECs. One is a
single-photon scheme in which an entangled single-photon state serves the
quantum channel to generate entangled distant BECs. The other is a multiphoton
scheme where an entangled coherent state of the probe lasers is used as the
quantum channel. Additionally, we also obtain some atom-photon entangled states
of particular interest such as entangled states between a pair of optical Bell
(or quasi-Bell) states and a pair of atomic entangled coherent (or quasi-Bell)
states.

relation of star-forming galaxies at redshift z~1.4. To reach this goal, we
present a first set of nine VVDS galaxies observed with the NIR integral-field
spectrograph SINFONI on the VLT. Oxygen abundances are derived from empirical
indicators based on the ratio between strong nebular emission-lines (Halpha,
[NII]6584 and [SII]6717,6731). Stellar masses are deduced from SED fitting with
Charlot & Bruzual (2007) population synthesis models, and star formation rates
are derived from [OII]3727 and Halpha emission-line luminosities. We find a
typical shift of 0.2-0.4 dex towards lower metallicities for the z~1.4
galaxies, compared to the MZ-relation in the local universe as derived from
SDSS data. However, this small sample of eight galaxies does not show any clear
correlation between stellar mass and metallicity, unlike other larger samples
at different redshift (z~0, z~0.7, and z~2). Indeed, our galaxies lie just
under the relation at z~2 and show a small trend for more massive galaxies to
be more metallic (~0.1 logarithmic slope). There are two possible explanations
to account for these observations. First, the most massive galaxies present
higher specific star formation rates when compared to the global VVDS sample
which could explain the particularly low metallicity of these galaxies as
already shown in the SDSS sample. Second, inflow of metal-poor gas due to tidal
interactions could also explain the low metallicity of these galaxies as two of
these three galaxies show clear signatures of merging in their velocity fields.
Finally, we find that the metallicity of 4 galaxies is lower by ~0.2 to 0.4 dex
if we take into account the N/O abundance ratio in their metallicity estimate.

increasing levels of activity around periastron passage. In this paper we
present results of a calculation from first principles of the velocity field on
the surface of a star that is perturbed by a binary companion. This allows us
to follow the orbital phase-dependence of the amount of kinetic energy that may
be dissipated through the viscous shear, dot-E, driven by tidal interactions.
For stars with relatively small stellar radii compared with the orbital
separation at periastron (R/r_per< 0.14), a clear maximum occurs before
periastron passage for sub-synchronous rotation and after periastron for
super-synchronous rotation. For larger stellar radii however, dot-E oscillates
over the orbital cycle and periastron passage does not cause a particularly
greater enhancement in energy dissipation rates than some of the other orbital
phases. Finally, we perform exploratory calculations for a WR/LBV binary system
that in 1993-1994 underwent an LBV-like eruption, HD 5980. Our dot-E
calculations reproduce the oscillations that appear around periastron passage
in HD5980's recent visual light curve. We suggest that the energy dissipation
from tidal flows in asynchronously rotating binary stars may provide a
mechanism by which evolving stars may be driven into an active state. Given the
nature of the tidal perturbations, the resulting mass-loss distribution is
expected to be non-uniform over the stellar surface and highly time-dependent.

independent random errors. We start by proving a sharp PAC-Bayesian type bound
for the exponentially weighted aggregate (EWA) under the expected squared
empirical loss. For a broad class of noise distributions the presented bound is
valid whenever the temperature parameter $\beta$ of the EWA is larger than or
equal to $4\sigma^2$, where $\sigma^2$ is the noise variance. A remarkable
feature of this result is that it is valid even for unbounded regression
functions and the choice of the temperature parameter depends exclusively on
the noise level. Next, we apply this general bound to the problem of
aggregating the elements of a finite-dimensional linear space spanned by a
dictionary of functions $\phi_1,...,\phi_M$. We allow $M$ to be much larger
than the sample size $n$ but we assume that the true regression function can be
well approximated by a sparse linear combination of functions $\phi_j$. Under
this sparsity scenario, we propose an EWA with a heavy tailed prior and we show
that it satisfies a sparsity oracle inequality with leading constant one.
Finally, we propose several Langevin Monte-Carlo algorithms to approximately
compute such an EWA when the number $M$ of aggregated functions can be large.
We discuss in some detail the convergence of these algorithms and present
numerical experiments that confirm our theoretical findings.

a noticeable hemispherical power asymmetry in the WMAP data on small angular
scales, we revisit the dipole modulated signal model introduced by Gordon et
al. (2005). This model assumes that the true CMB signal consists of a Gaussian
isotropic random field modulated by a dipole, and is characterized by an
overall modulation amplitude, A, and a preferred direction, p. Previous
analyses of this model has been restricted to very low resolution due to
computational cost. In this paper, we double the angular resolution, and
compute the full corresponding posterior distribution for the 5-year WMAP data.
The results from our analysis are the following: The best-fit modulation
amplitude for l <= 64 and the ILC data with the WMAP KQ85 sky cut is A=0.072
+/- 0.022, non-zero at 3.3sigma, and the preferred direction points toward
Galactic coordinates (l,b) = (224 degree, -22 degree) +/- 24 degree. The
corresponding results for l <~ 40 from earlier analyses was A = 0.11 +/- 0.04
and (l,b) = (225 degree,-27 degree). The statistical significance of a non-zero
amplitude thus increases from 2.8sigma to 3.3sigma when increasing l_max from
40 to 64, and all results are consistent to within 1sigma. Similarly, the
Bayesian log-evidence difference with respect to the isotropic model increases
from Delta ln E = 1.8 to Delta ln E = 2.6, ranking as ""strong evidence"" on the
Jeffreys' scale. The raw best-fit log-likelihood difference increases from
Delta ln L = 6.1 to Delta ln L = 7.3. Similar, and often slightly stronger,
results are found for other data combinations. Thus, we find that the evidence

wells is investigated by applying the magnetic field induced photogalvanic
effect. We demonstrate that the structure inversion asymmetry (SIA) can be
tailored by variation of the delta-doping layer position. Symmetrically-doped
structures exhibit a substantial SIA due to impurity segregation during the
growth process. Tuning the SIA by the delta-doping position we grow samples
with almost equal degrees of structure and bulk inversion asymmetry.

antiferromagnetic polarizations, extending over a few unit cells. At low
temperature, these extended moments freeze in a process which is found
universal among various other spin-gapped compounds: isolated ladders, Haldane
or Spin-Peierls chains. This allows us to propose a simple common framework to
explain the generic low-temperature impurity induced freezings observed in low
dimensional spin-gapped materials.

quantum walk for an electron in a one-dimensional chain of quantum dots. The
operating principle of the step operator is based on locally enhanced Zeeman
splitting and the role of the quantum coin is played by the spin of the
electron. We calculate the probability of successful transfer of the electron
in the presence of decoherence due to quantum charge fluctuations, modeled as a
bosonic bath. We then analyze two mechanisms for creating locally enhanced
Zeeman splitting based on, respectively, locally applied electric and magnetic
fields and slanting magnetic fields. Our results imply that a success
probability of > 90% is feasible under realistic experimental conditions.

Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in an external perpendicular magnetic field is
theoretically studied. We concentrate on the effects on the magnetization
induced by the system boundary, the Rashba SOC and the temperature. It is found
that the sawtooth-like de Haas--van Alphen (dHvA) oscillations of the
magnetization will change dramatically in the presence of such three factors.
Especially, the effects of the edge states and Rashba SOC on the magnetization
are more evident when the magnetic field is more small. The oscillation center
will shift when the boundary effect is considered and the Rashba SOC will bring
beating patterns to the dHvA oscillations. These effects on the dHvA
oscillations are preferred to be observed at low temperature. With increasing
the temperature, the dHvA oscillations turn to be blurred and eventually
disappear.
