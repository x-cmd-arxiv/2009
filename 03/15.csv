cosmological parameters? And how does our choice of a dark energy model impact
the current constraints on standard cosmological parameters?
  We address these questions in the context of the widely used CPL
parametrization of a time varying equation of state w in a cosmology allowing
spatial curvature. We study examples of different behavior allowed in a CPL
parametrization in a phase diagram, and relate these to effects on the
observables. We examine parameter constraints in such a cosmology by combining
WMAP5, SDSS, SNe, HST data sets by comparing the power spectra. We carefully
quantify the differences of these constraints to those obtained by using
geometrical summaries for the same data sets.
  We find that (a) using summary parameters instead of the full data sets give
parameter constraints that are similar, but with discernible differences, (b)
due to degeneracies, the constraints on the standard parameters broaden
significantly for the same data sets. In particular, we find that in the
context of CPL dark energy, (i) a Harrison-Zeldovich spectrum cannot be ruled
out at $2\sigma$ levels with our current data sets. and (ii) the SNe IA, HST,
and WMAP 5 data are not sufficient to constrain spatial curvature; we
additionally require the SDSS DR4 data to achieve this.

barrier. For an infinite barrier we study the one-particle and two-particle
static correlation functions. For the one-body density-matrix we obtain
different power-law decays depending on the location of the probe points with
respect to the position of the barrier. This quasi-long range order can be
experimentally probed in principle using an interference measurement. The
corresponding momentum distribution at small momenta is also shown to be
affected by the presence of the barrier and to display the universal power-law
behavior expected for an interacting 1D fluid. We also evaluate the particle
density profile, and by comparing with the exact results in the Tonks-Girardeau
limit we fix the nonuniversal parameters of the Luttinger-liquid theory. Once
the parameters are determined from one-body properties, we evaluate the
density-density correlation function, finding a remarkable agreement between
the Luttinger liquid predictions and the exact result in the Tonks-Girardeau
limit, even at the length scale of the Friedel-like oscillations which
characterize the behavior of the density-density correlation function at
intermediate distance. Finally, for a large but finite barrier we use the
one-body correlation function to estimate the effect of quantum fluctuations on
the renormalization of the barrier height, finding a reduction of the effective
Josephson coupling energy, which depends on the length of the ring and on the

Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) and Unanimity and is not a
Dictator has to be non-transitive. In this paper we study quantitative versions
of Arrow theorem. Consider $n$ voters who vote independently at random, each
following the uniform distribution over the 6 rankings of 3 alternatives.
Arrow's theorem implies that any constitution which satisfies IIA and Unanimity
and is not a dictator has a probability of at least $6^{-n}$ for a
non-transitive outcome. When $n$ is large, $6^{-n}$ is a very small
probability, and the question arises if for large number of voters it is
possible to avoid paradoxes with probability close to 1.
  Here we give a negative answer to this question by proving that for every
$\eps > 0$, there exists a $\delta = \delta(\eps) > 0$, which depends on $\eps$
only, such that for all $n$, and all constitutions on 3 alternatives, if the
constitution satisfies: The IIA condition. For every pair of alternatives
$a,b$, the probability that the constitution ranks $a$ above $b$ is at least
$\eps$. For every voter $i$, the probability that the social choice function
agrees with a dictatorship on $i$ at most $1-\eps$. Then the probability of a
non-transitive outcome is at least $\delta$.

properties and yet the prototype of its own small class. In this paper we
examine the X-ray spectra for a 2004 XMM-Newton observation and a previously
published 2001 Chandra observation. In both cases the spectra can be modeled
with 3 or 4 thermal components, which appear be discrete in temperature and
spatially distinct. The dominant component, having kT ~ 12 keV contributes most
(~80-90%) of the flux. The secondary components have temperatures in the range
of 2-3 keV to 0.1 keV; these values can shift in time. Importantly, we find
that the strong absorption of soft X-rays in 2001 is absent in 2004, meaning
that an absorbing column in front of the source has moved off the star or has
been removed. Other differences include a reduced Fe abundance from the ionized
lines of the FeKalpha complex (even more subsolar than the 2001 observation), a
decrease of the Fe K and possibly of the Si K fluorescence features, and from
the NVII and NeX H-alpha lines, a possible overabundance of N and Ne. Also, we
note common characteristics in both spectra that seem to set gCas apart from
HD110342, another member of this subclass studied in detail. In this sense
these stars have different ""personalities."" For example, for gCas rapid X-ray
flaring and slower changes in the light curve are only seldomly accompanied by
variations in hardness, and the hot X-ray component remains nearly constant in
temperature. Moreover, the light curve shows recurrent ""lulls"" in flux,
suggesting that a relaxation cycle is operates as part of the (unknown) X-ray
generation process.

model that has two $q$-parameters $q_1,q_2$. This model, like the ordinary one
with a single $q$-parameter, is formulated as a model of random plane
partitions (or, equivalently, random 3D Young diagrams). The Boltzmann weight
contains an infinite number of external potentials that depend on the shape of
the diagonal slice of plane partitions. The partition function is thereby a
function of an infinite number of coupling constants $t_1,t_2,...$ and an extra
one $Q$. There is a compact expression of this partition function in the
language of a 2D complex free fermion system, from which one can see the
presence of a quantum torus algebra behind this model. The partition function
turns out to be a tau function (times a simple factor) of two integrable
structures simultaneously. The first integrable structure is the bigraded Toda
hierarchy, which determine the dependence on $t_1,t_2,...$. This integrable
structure emerges when the $q$-parameters $q_1,q_2$ take special values. The
second integrable structure is a $q$-difference analogue of the 1D Toda
equation. The partition function satisfies this $q$-difference equation with
respect to $Q$. Unlike the bigraded Toda hierarchy, this integrable structure
exists for any values of $q_1,q_2$.

ribosome can be regarded as a molecular motor which utilizes the input chemical
energy to move on a messenger RNA (mRNA) track that also serves as a template
for the polymerization of the corresponding protein. The forward movement,
however, is characterized by an alternating sequence of translocation and
pause. Using a quantitative model, which captures the mechanochemical cycle of
an individual ribosome, we derive an {\it exact} analytical expression for the
distribution of its dwell times at the successive positions on the mRNA track.
Inverse of the average dwell time satisfies a ``Michaelis-Menten-like''
equation and is consistent with the general formula for the average velocity of
a molecular motor with an unbranched mechano-chemical cycle. Extending this
formula appropriately, we also derive the exact force-velocity relation for a
ribosome. Often many ribosomes simultaneously move on the same mRNA track,
while each synthesizes a copy of the same protein. We extend the model of a
single ribosome by incorporating steric exclusion of different individuals on
the same track. We draw the phase diagram of this model of ribosome traffic in
3-dimensional spaces spanned by experimentally controllable parameters. We
suggest new experimental tests of our theoretical predictions.

the interaction of the electron wave packet with the magnet is negligible -the

due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and for large variances to the

remedies some shortcomings and loophole of the old version. The top-Higgs in
the TC2 model is a mixture of the top-Higgs of the toptechnicolor model and
that of the ETC model, thus a parameter $\epsilon$ is introduced to denote the
mixture. Moreover, we vary the mass range of the top-Higgs within 300 to 800
GeV while in arXiv:hep-ph/9905347v2, the mass range was taken as 200 to 400
GeV. In the work, our numerical results show that the production rate of single

within the mass range of 200 to 400 GeV. This manifests that change from the
original toptechnicolor model to the new TC2 version does not much affect the
production rate of the top-Higgs even though the two top-Higgs in the two
models are different. Beyond the 400 GeV, even the TC2 model predicts a
negligible production rate at LHC. Since the phenomenological change is indeed
not obvious, there is not much new to report. Even though the two models are
somehow different, we believe that the result is not worth publishing.

generating functional for the Green functions of Quantum Isometrodynamics (QID)
is derived. Feynman rules in covariant Euclidean gauges are determined and QID
is shown to be renormalizable by power counting. Asymptotic states are
discussed and new quantum numbers related to the ""inner"" degrees of freedom
introduced. The one-loop effective action in a Euclidean background gauge is
formally calculated and shown to be finite and gauge-invariant after
renormalization and a consistent definition of the arising ""inner"" space
momentum integrals. Pure QID is shown to be asymptotically free for all
dimensions of ""inner"" space $D$ whereas QID coupled to the Standard Model
fields is not asymptotically free for D <= 7. Finally nilpotent BRST
transformations for Isometrodynamics are derived along with the BRST symmetry
of the theory and a scetch of the general proof of renormalizability for QID is
given.

nucleus in eukaryotic cells. Selective transport of proteins is mediated by
soluble receptors, whose regulation by the small GTPase Ran leads to cargo
accumulation in, or depletion from the nucleus, i.e., nuclear import or nuclear
export. We consider the operation of this transport system by a combined
analytical and experimental approach. Provocative predictions of a simple model
were tested using cell-free nuclei reconstituted in Xenopus egg extract, a
system well suited to quantitative studies. We found that accumulation capacity
is limited, so that introduction of one import cargo leads to egress of
another. Clearly, the pore per se does not determine transport directionality.
Moreover, different cargo reach a similar ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic
concentration in steady-state. The model shows that this ratio should in fact
be independent of the receptor-cargo affinity, though kinetics may be strongly
influenced. Numerical conservation of the system components highlights a
conflict between the observations and the popular concept of transport cycles.
We suggest that chemical partitioning provides a framework to understand the
capacity to generate concentration gradients by equilibration of the
receptor-cargo intermediary.

high-intensity focussed ultrasound, the accuracy of predictive models is
critical for the safety and efficacy of treatment. In such fields inertial
cavitation is often observed. Classically, estimations of cavitation thresholds
have been based on the assumption that the incident wave at the surface of a
bubble was the same as in the far-field, neglecting the effect of nonlinear
wave propagation. By modelling the incident wave as a solution to Burgers'
equation using weak shock theory, the effects of nonlinear wave propagation on
inertial cavitation are investigated using both numerical and analytical
techniques. From radius-time curves for a single bubble, it is observed that
there is a reduction in the maximum size of a bubble undergoing inertial
cavitation and that the inertial collapse occurs earlier in contrast with the
classical case. Corresponding stability thresholds for a bubble whose initial
radius is slightly below the critical Blake radius are calculated. Bifurcation
diagrams and frequency-response curves are presented associated with the loss
of stability. The consequences and physical implications of the results are
discussed with respect to the classical results.
