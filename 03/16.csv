relative to Fe, for 147 red-sequence galaxies in the Coma cluster and the
Shapley Supercluster. The sample covers a six-magnitude range in luminosity,
from giant ellipticals to dwarfs at M^*+4. We exploit the wide mass range to
investigate systematic trends in the abundance ratios Mg/Fe, Ca/Fe, C/Fe and
N/Fe. We find that each of these ratios can be well modelled using
two-parameter relations of the form [X/Fe] = a0 + a1 log sigma + a2 [Fe/H],
where sigma is the velocity dispersion. Analysing these ""X-planes"" reveals new
structure in the abundance patterns, beyond the traditional one-parameter (e.g.
Mg/Fe-sigma) correlations. The X-planes for the alpha elements, Mg and Ca,
indicate a positive correlation with velocity dispersion, and simultaneously an
anti-correlation with Fe/H (i.e. a1>0 and a2<0). Taking both effects into
account dramatically reduces the scatter, compared to the traditional
X/Fe-sigma relations. For C and N, a similar correlation with velocity
dispersion is recovered, but there is no additional dependence on Fe/H (i.e.
a1>0 and a2~0). The explicit dependence of X/Fe on two parameters is evidence
that at least two physical processes are at work in setting the abundance
patterns. The Fe/H dependence of Mg/Fe and Ca/Fe, at fixed sigma, may result
from different durations of star formation, from galaxy to galaxy. The absence
of corresponding Fe/H dependence for C and N is consistent with these elements
being generated in lower-mass stars. The increase with sigma, at fixed Fe/H, is
similar for elements Mg, C and N, and slightly shallower for Ca. This pattern
of trends cannot be explained solely by a systematic variation of
star-formation time-scale with sigma.

other available data. We investigate the value of (g-2) as obtained by using
e+e- data alone (which shows a ~3sigma discrepancy with the SM prediction) and
as obtained based on tau decay data (which shows a much milder, 1sigma
discrepancy). We find that one of our tests returns either a statistically
inconclusive result or shows weak evidence of tension between BR(b->s gamma)

observations of BR(b->s gamma) and (g-2) from e+e- data alone are incompatible
within the CMSSM at the ~2sigma level. On the other hand, for both tests we
find no significant tension between BR(b->s gamma) and the value of (g-2)
evaluated using tau decay data. These results are only weakly dependent on the
three different priors that we employ in the analysis. We conclude that, if the

acquired under field-cooling conditions under a 10 kOe field, the the usual
downturn expected for antiferromagnetic ordering is obtained. Heat capacity
measurements at low temperatures indicate the presence of gapped behavior with

guiding magnetic field, a return electronic current and moving protons.
Considering any orientations of the wave vector allows to retrieve the most

numerical calculations are conducted with two different values, namely 1/1836

governed by each kind of instability is far from being trivial. For low density
beams, the ultra-magnetized regime tends to be governed by either the
Two-Stream or the Buneman instabilities. For beam densities equalling the
plasma one, up to four kinds of modes are likely to play a role, depending of
the beam Lorentz factor. In some regions of the system parameters phase space,
the dominant mode may vary with the electron-to-proton mass ratio. Application
is made to Solar Flares, Intergalactic Streams and Relativistic shocks physics.

our understanding of formation and dynamics of planetary systems via numerical
simulations. Traditional N-body simulations of multiple-planet systems without
gas disks have successfully reproduced the eccentricity (e) distribution of the
observed systems, by assuming that the planetary systems are relatively closely
packed when the gas disk dissipates, so that they become dynamically unstable
within the stellar lifetime. However, such studies cannot explain the small
semi-major axes (a) of extrasolar planetary systems, if planets are formed, as
the standard planet formation theory suggests, beyond the ice line.
  In this paper, we numerically study the evolution of three-planet systems in
dissipating gas disks, and constrain the initial conditions that reproduce the
observed semi-major axis and eccentricity distributions simultaneously. We
adopt the initial conditions that are motivated by the standard planet
formation theory, and self-consistently simulate the disk evolution, and planet
migration by using a hybrid N-body and 1D gas disk code. We also take account
of eccentricity damping, and investigate the effect of saturation of corotation
resonances on the evolution of planetary systems. We find that the semi-major
axis distribution is largely determined in a gas disk, while the eccentricity
distribution is determined after the disk dissipation. We also find that there
may be an optimum disk mass which leads to the observed a-e distribution. Our
simulations generate a larger fraction of planetary systems trapped in
mean-motion resonances (MMRs) than the observations, indicating that the disk's
perturbation to the planetary orbits may be important to explain the observed
rate of MMRs. We also find much lower occurrence of planets on retrograde
orbits than the current observations of close-in planets suggest.

resolved X-ray knots embedded in a continuous diffuse bridge. The spectrum of
each knot is well fitted by a thermal model with temperatures ranging from
0.3-0.7 keV and subsolar elemental abundances. In four of the five knots,
non-thermal models are a poor fit to the spectra, conclusively ruling out
synchrotron or IC/CMB mechanisms for their emission. The internal pressures of
the knots exceed that of the ambient ISM or the equipartition pressure of the
NML by more than an order of magnitude, demonstrating that they must be short
lived ($\sim3\times10^6$ yrs). Based on energetic arguments, it is implausible
that these knots have been ionized by the beamed flux from the active galactic
nucleus of Cen A or that they have been shock-heated by supersonic inflation of
the NML. In our view, the most viable scenario for the origin of the X-ray
knots is that they are the result of cold gas shock heated by a direct
interaction with the jet. The lifetimes of the X-ray knots in the NML are
roughly the same as the age of the strong shock around the SW inner lobe,
suggesting they were created in the same AGN outburst. The most plausible model
of the NML is that it is a bubble from a previous outburst that is being

disks. Few late-type, solar/subsolar-mass stars have primordial disks. The disk
population around late-type stars is dominated by disks with inner holes
(canonical 'transition disks') and 'homologously depleted' disks. Both types of
disks represent an intermediate stage between primordial disks and debris
disks. Thus, we find that multiple paths for the primordial-to-debris disk
transition exist. Our results undermine standard arguments in favor of a ~ 0.01
Myr year timescale for the transition based on data from Taurus-Auriga and rule
out standard UV photoevaporation scenarios as the primary mechanism to explain
the transition. Combining our data with other Spitzer surveys, we investigate
the evolution of debris disks around high/intermediate-mass stars and
investigate timescales for giant planet formation. If the gas and dust in disks
evolve on similar timescales, the formation timescale for gas giant planets
surrounding early-type, high/intermediate-mass stars is likely 1--5 Myr. Most

the correlation between morphology, color, and star formation rate of each
galaxy with its surrounding number density, mass density, and temperature of
Intracluster Medium (ICM). Although our results show that the two clusters
exhibit a weaker correlation compared with relaxed clusters, it still confirms
the significant effect of the ICM in varying the star formation rates in the
galaxies. Various physical mechanisms have been suggested to explain the
relation between the properties of galaxies and their environments for example:
ram pressure stripping, mergers etc. Nonetheless, using this analysis alone, it
is difficult to identify the dominant environmental mechanism(s) operating in
clusters of galaxies and the role of the initial condition.

perturbation theory without ignoring the pressure gradient term. We consider a
semi-realistic system consisting of two matter components with and without
pressure, and both are expanded into the 3rd order in perturbations in a
self-consistent manner, for the first time. While the pressured component may
be identified with baryons or neutrinos, in this paper we mainly explore the
physics of the non-linear pressure effect using a toy model in which the Jeans
length does not depend on time, i.e., the sound speed decreases as 1/a^{1/2},
where a is the scale factor. The linear analysis shows that the power spectrum
below the so-called filtering scale is suppressed relative to the power
spectrum of the cold dark matter. Our non-linear calculation shows that the
actual filtering scale for a given sound speed is smaller than the linear
filtering scale by a factor depending on the redshift and the Jeans length. A
~40% change is common, and our results suggest that, when applied to baryons,
the temperature of the Inter-galactic Medium inferred from the filtering scale
observed in the flux power spectrum of Lyman-alpha forests would be
underestimated by a factor of two, if one used the linear filtering scale to
interpret the data. The filtering mass, which is proportional to the filtering
scale cubed, can also be significantly smaller than the linear theory
prediction especially at low redshift, where the actual filtering mass can be
smaller than the linear prediction by a factor of three. Finally, when applied
to neutrinos, we find that neutrino perturbations deviate significantly from
linear perturbations even below the free-streaming scales, and thus neutrinos
cannot be treated as linear perturbations.

evaporation) of water ice. It is driven directly by the orbital parameters
obliquity, eccentricity and solar longitude (Ls) of perihelion. Surface
temperature is described by the Local Insolation Temperature (LIT) scheme,
which uses a daily and latitude-dependent radiation balance. The evaporation
rate of water is calculated by an expression for free convection, driven by
density differences between water vapor and ambient air, the condensation rate
follows from the assumption that any water vapour which exceeds the local
saturation pressure condenses instantly, and atmospheric transport of water
vapour is approximated by instantaneous mixing. Glacial flow of ice deposits is
neglected. Simulations with constant orbital parameters show that low
obliquities favour deposition of ice in high latitudes and vice versa. A
transient scenario driven by a computed history of orbital parameters over the
last 10 million years produces essentially monotonically growing polar ice
deposits during the most recent 4 million years, and a very good agreement with
the observed present-day polar layered deposits. The thick polar deposits
sometimes continue in thin ice deposits which extend far into the mid

laminar flow is described as a macro deformation which forms an instant
curvature space. On such a curvature space, the turbulence is viewed as a micro
deformation. So, the fluid flow is described by the geometrical field theory of
finite deformation. Based on the Lagrange mechanics and the deformation energy
concept, using the Least Action Principle, the Euler-Lagrange motion equations
are obtained. According to A E Green formulation, the stress concept is
introduced by deformation tensor. The fluid motion is described by the
multiplication of a macro deformation tensor and a micro deformation tensor. By
this way, the geometrical field of fluid motion is well constructed. Then, the
spatial derivative of deformation energy is expressed by the gradient of
deformation tensors. By this way, the deformation energy related items in the
Euler-Lagrange motion equations are expressed by the stress tensor and
deformation tensor. The obtained Euler-Lagrange motion equations, then, are
decomposed into average deformation equations and turbulence equations. For
several special cases, the new results are compared with the conventional
Navier-Stokes equation with Reynolds stress modification.The comparisons also
show that the Bernoulli Equation is a natural precondition for the conventional
Navier-Stokes equation.Generally, the turbulence wave is an inward-traveling
wave. Unlike the normal outward-traveling wave related with the average
deformation, the inward-traveling wave is the intrinsic feature of turbulence.
So, the turbulence is well defined by the equations obtained in this research.
For several typical cases, the simplified turbulence wave equations are given
out with simple discussion.

surrounded by a number of HI fragments, the tidally disturbed galaxy NGC 3263,
and several other peculiar galaxies. The Vela Cloud, with an HI mass of 3-5 *
10**9 solar masses, resides southeast of NGC 3256 and west of NGC 3263, within
an area of 9' x 16' (100 kpc x 175 kpc for an adopted distance of 38 Mpc). In
our ATCA data the Vela Cloud appears as 3 diffuse components and contains 4
density enhancements. The Vela Cloud's properties, together with its group
environment, suggest that it has a tidal origin. Each density enhancement
contains ~10**8 solar masses of HI gas which is sufficient material for the
formation of globular cluster progenitors. However, if we represent the
enhancements as Bonnor-Ebert spheres, then the pressure of the surrounding HI
would need to increase by at least a factor of 6 in order to cause the collapse
of an enhancement. Thus we do not expect them to form massive bound stellar
systems like super star clusters or tidal dwarf galaxies. Since the HI density
enhancements have some properties in common with High Velocity Clouds, we
explore whether they may evolve to be identified with these starless clouds
instead.

research. DNA can be used in cryptography for storing and transmitting the
information, as well as for computation. Although in its primitive stage, DNA
cryptography is shown to be very effective. Currently, several DNA computing
algorithms are proposed for quite some cryptography, cryptanalysis and
steganography problems, and they are very powerful in these areas. However, the
use of the DNA as a means of cryptography has high tech lab requirements and
computational limitations, as well as the labor intensive extrapolation means
so far. These make the efficient use of DNA cryptography difficult in the
security world now. Therefore, more theoretical analysis should be performed
before its real applications.
  In this project, We do not intended to utilize real DNA to perform the
cryptography process; rather, We will introduce a new cryptography method based
on central dogma of molecular biology. Since this method simulates some
critical processes in central dogma, it is a pseudo DNA cryptography method.
The theoretical analysis and experiments show this method to be efficient in
computation, storage and transmission; and it is very powerful against certain
attacks. Thus, this method can be of many uses in cryptography, such as an
enhancement insecurity and speed to the other cryptography methods. There are
also extensions and variations to this method, which have enhanced security,
effectiveness and applicability.

  2009",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we study a dynamic vehicle routing problem in which there are
multiple vehicles and multiple classes of demands. Demands of each class arrive
in the environment randomly over time and require a random amount of on-site
service that is characteristic of the class. To service a demand, one of the
vehicles must travel to the demand location and remain there for the required
on-site service time. The quality of service provided to each class is given by
the expected delay between the arrival of a demand in the class, and that
demand's service completion. The goal is to design a routing policy for the
service vehicles which minimizes a convex combination of the delays for each
class. First, we provide a lower bound on the achievable values of the convex
combination of delays. Then, we propose a novel routing policy and analyze its
performance under heavy load conditions (i.e., when the fraction of time the
service vehicles spend performing on-site service approaches one). The policy
performs within a constant factor of the lower bound (and thus the optimal),
where the constant depends only on the number of classes, and is independent of
the number of vehicles, the arrival rates of demands, the on-site service
times, and the convex combination coefficients.

well understood. For instance, the magnetic helicity of an active region is
often about $10^{42}$ Mx$^2$ ($10^{26}$ Wb$^{2}$), but the observed processes
whereby it is thought to be injected into the corona do not yet provide an
accurate estimate of the resulting magnetic helicity budget or time evolution.
The variation in magnetic helicity is important for understanding the physics
of flares, coronal mass ejections, and their associated magnetic clouds. To
shed light on this topic, we investigate here the changes in magnetic helicity
due to electric currents in the corona for a single twisted flux tube that may
model characteristic coronal structures such as active region filaments,
sigmoids, or coronal loops. For a bipolar photospheric magnetic field and
several distributions of current, we extrapolated the coronal field as a
nonlinear force-free field. We then computed the relative magnetic helicity, as
well as the self and mutual helicities. Starting from a magnetic configuration
with a moderate amount of current, the amount of magnetic helicity can increase
by 2 orders of magnitude when the maximum current strength is increased by a
factor of 2. The high sensitivity of magnetic helicity to the current density
can partially explain discrepancies between measured values on the photosphere,
in the corona, and in magnetic clouds. Our conclusion is that the magnetic
helicity strongly depends on both the strength of the current density and also
on its distribution. Only improved measurements of current density at the
photospheric level will advance our knowledge of the magnetic helicity content
in the solar atmosphere.

of the related literature is concerned with approximating $\psi (x,y)$ by
Dickman's function $\rho (u)$, where $u=\ln x/\ln y$. A typical such result is
that $$ \psi (x,y)=x\rho (u)(1+o(1)) \eqno (1) $$ in a certain domain of the

  In this paper a different type of approximation of $\psi (x,y)$, using

$k$-fold iterated logarithm). The approximation (2) holds in a domain which is
complementary to the one on which the approximation (1) is known to be valid.
One consequence of (2) is an asymptotic expression for Dickman's function,
which is of the form $\ln \rho (u)=-u[\ln u+\ln ^{(2)}u](1+o(1))$, improving
known asymptotic approximations of this type. We employ (2) to establish a

of the external magnetic field B(r) corresponding to a given pair of density
n(r) and spin density n_s(r). For ground states, the nonuniqueness of B(r)
implies the nondifferentiability of the energy functional E[n,n_s] with respect

fluid, that contributes to the universe accelerated expansion, is introduced in
an F (R) model. At the early stages of the universe history, the dark fluid is
seen to give rise to a deceleration of its expansion. For t close to present
time it works as an additional contribution to the effective cosmological
constant and, later, it produces the transition to a phantom era, which could
actually be taking place right now in some regions of the cosmos, and might
have observable consequences. For t close to the Rip time, the universe becomes
completely dominated by the dark fluid, whose equation of state is phantom-like
at that time. Our model, which is able to reproduce the dark energy period
quite precisely, may still be modified in such a way that the epoch dominated
by an effective cosmological constant, produced by the F (R) term and by the
dark fluid contribution, becomes significantly shorter, what happens when a
matter term is included. The dark fluid with phantom behavior gives rise to a
super-accelerated phase, as compared with the case where just the viable F (R)
term contributes. It is also seen explicitly that an F (R) theory can be
constructed from a phantom model in a scalar-tensor theory, in which the scalar
field does not behave as phantom (in the latter case the action for F (R) would

particularly in cases involving single scattering around a central source.
Utilizing a novel liquid crystal device (the ``theta cell'') that transforms
the coordinate system of linear polarization in an image plane from Cartesian
to polar, the observation of centrosymmetric polarization patterns can be
improved: instead of measuring Stokes Q and U on the sky, one only needs to
measure Stokes Q' in the new instrument coordinate system. This reduces the
effective exposure time by a factor of two and simplifies the polarization
modulator design. According to the manufacturer's specifications and to
measurements in the lab, the liquid crystal device can be applied in the
visible and NIR wavelength range. Astronomical science cases for a``radial
polarimeter'' include exoplanet detection, imaging of circumstellar disks,
reflection nebulae and light echos, characterization of planetary atmospheres
and diagnostics of the solar K-corona. The first astronomical instrument that
utilizes a theta cell for radial polarimetry is the S5T (Small Synoptic Second
Solar Spectrum Telescope), which accurately measures scattering polarization
signals near the limb of the sun. These observations are crucial for
understanding the nature and origin of weak, turbulent magnetic fields in the
solar photosphere and elsewhere in the universe. A ``radial polarimeter''
observing a slightly defocused point source performs one-shot full linear
polarimetry. With a theta cell in a pupil plane, a beam's linear polarization
properties (e.g. for calibration purposes) can be fully controlled through
pupil masking.

measurements after spatial or temporal polarization modulation. Such classical
polarimeters are limited in sensitivity and accuracy by systematic effects and
noise. We describe a spectral modulation principle that is based on encoding
the full linear polarization properties of light in its spectrum. Such spectral
modulation is obtained with an optical train of an achromatic quarter-wave
retarder, an athermal multiple-order retarder, and a polarizer. The emergent
spectral modulation is sinusoidal with its amplitude scaling with the degree of
linear polarization and its phase scaling with the angle of linear
polarization. The large advantage of this passive setup is that all
polarization information is, in principle, contained in a single spectral
measurement, thereby eliminating all differential effects that potentially
create spurious polarization signals. Since the polarization properties are
obtained through curve fitting, the susceptibility to noise is relatively low.
We provide general design options for a spectral modulator and describe the
design of a prototype modulator. Currently, the setup in combination with a
dedicated retrieval algorithm can be used to measure linear polarization
signals with a relative accuracy of 5%.

increase in soft X-ray emission is observed minutes before the onset of the
hard X-ray emission. Such pre-flare emission clearly contradicts the classical
flare picture. For the first time, the pre-flare phase of such solar flares is
studied in detail. We want to explain the time evolution of the observed
emission by means of alternative energy transport mechanisms such as heat
conduction. RHESSI events displaying pronounced pre-flare emission were
analyzed in imaging and spectroscopy. The pre-flare phase is characterized by
purely thermal emission from a coronal source with increasing emission measure
and density. After this earliest phase, a small non-thermal tail to higher
energies appears in the spectra, becoming more and more pronounced. However,
images still only display one X-ray source, implying that this non-thermal
emission is coronal. The increase of emission measure and density indicates
that material is added to the coronal region. The most plausible origin is
evaporated material from the chromosphere. Energy provided by a heat flux is

signal in intensity by orders of magnitude. We argue that in principle it would
be better to fit the foregrounds non-parametrically - allowing the data to
determine their shape - rather than selecting some functional form in advance
and then fitting its parameters. Non-parametric fits often suffer from other
problems, however. We discuss these before suggesting a non-parametric method,
Wp smoothing, which seems to avoid some of them. After outlining the principles
of Wp smoothing we describe an algorithm used to implement it. We then apply Wp
smoothing to a synthetic data cube for the LOFAR EoR experiment. The
performance of Wp smoothing, measured by the extent to which it is able to
recover the variance of the cosmological signal and to which it avoids leakage
of power from the foregrounds, is compared to that of a parametric fit, and to
another non-parametric method (smoothing splines). We find that Wp smoothing is
superior to smoothing splines for our application, and is competitive with
parametric methods even though in the latter case we may choose the functional
form of the fit with advance knowledge of the simulated foregrounds. Finally,
we discuss how the quality of the fit is affected by the frequency resolution
and range, by the characteristics of the cosmological signal and by edge
effects.

in the Clausius' Virial (CV) potential energy of a early type galaxy (ETG)
stellar component when it is completely embedded inside a dark matter (DM)
halo. At the first order approximation the theory was developed by modeling the
two-components with two cored power-law density profiles. An higher level of
approximation is now taken into account by developing the same theory when the
stellar component is modeled by a King-model with a cut-off. Even if the DM
halo density remains a cored power law the inner component is now more
realistic for the ETGs. The new formulation allows us to understand more deeply
what is the dynamical reason of the FP tilt and in general how the CV theory
may really be the engine to produce the FP main features. The degeneracy of FP
in respect to the initial density perturbation spectrum may be now full
understood in a CDM cosmological scenario. A possible way to compare the FPs

section of K3 surfaces are distinguished by the non-surjectivity of their Wahl

of abelian surfaces. The somewhat surprising result is that the Wahl map of
such curves is (tendentially) surjective, but their second Wahl map has corank

transitions in one-dimensional Bethe ansatz integrable spin-1/2 attractive
fermions with polarization by means of the dressed energy formalism. An
iteration method is presented to derive higher order corrections for the ground
state energy, critical fields and magnetic properties. Numerical solutions of
the dressed energy equations confirm that the analytic expressions for these
physical quantities and resulting phase diagrams are highly accurate in the
weak and strong coupling regimes, capturing the precise nature of magnetic
effects and quantum phase transitions in one-dimensional interacting fermions
with population imbalance. Moreover, it is shown that the universality class of
linear field-dependent behaviour of the magnetization holds throughout the
whole attractive regime.

an ensemble of pairs of quantum dots undergoing radiative recombination. At
short (picosecond) delay times, the response signal shows beats that may be
dominated by the subensemble of resonant pairs, which gives access to the
information on the interdot coupling. At longer delay times, the decay of the
FWM signal is governed by two rates which result from the collective
interaction between the two dots and the radiation modes. The two rates
correspond to the subradiant and super-radiant components in the radiative
decay. Coupling between the dots enhances the collective effects and makes them
observable even when the average energy mismatch between the dots is relatively
large.

energy density depends on only one parameter which in turn may depend at most
on the spatial dimensionality of the system.

earthquakes [PRA 46, 6288 (1992)], where we assume a static friction that is a
stochastic function of position rather than being velocity dependent. The model
consists of an array of blocks coupled by springs, with the forces between
neighbouring blocks balanced by static friction. We calculate the probability,
P(s), of the occurrence of avalanches with a size s or greater, finding that
our results are consistent with the phenomenology and also with previous models
which exhibit a power law over a wide range. We show that the train model may
be mapped onto a stochastic sandpile model and study a variant of the latter
for non-spherical grains. We show that, in this case, the model has critical
behaviour only for grains with large aspect ratio, as was already shown in
experiments with real ricepiles. We also demonstrate a way to introduce
randomness in a physically motivated manner into the model.

infra-red divergences. Long ago, Starobinsky proposed that infra-red effects in
de Sitter space could be accommodated by evolving the long-wavelength part of
the field according to the classical field equations plus a stochastic source
term. I argue that--when quantum-mechanical loop corrections are taken into
account--the separate-universe picture of superhorizon evolution in de Sitter
space is equivalent, in a certain leading-logarithm approximation, to
Starobinsky's stochastic approach. In particular, the time evolution of a box
of de Sitter space can be understood in exact analogy with the DGLAP evolution
of partons within a hadron, which describes a slow logarithmic evolution in the
distribution of the hadron's constituent partons with the energy scale at which
they are probed.
