stellar masses of galaxies and the masses of the dark matter halos in which
they reside. We obtain a parameterized stellar-to-halo mass (SHM) relation by
populating halos and subhalos in an N-body simulation with galaxies and
requiring that the observed stellar mass function be reproduced. We find good
agreement with constraints from galaxy-galaxy lensing and predictions of
semi-analytic models. Using this mapping, and the positions of the halos and
subhalos obtained from the simulation, we find that our model predictions for
the galaxy two-point correlation function (CF) as a function of stellar mass
are in excellent agreement with the observed clustering properties in the SDSS
at z=0. We show that the clustering data do not provide additional strong
constraints on the SHM function and conclude that our model can therefore
predict clustering as a function of stellar mass. We compute the conditional
mass function, which yields the average number of galaxies with stellar masses
in the range [m, m+dm] that reside in a halo of mass M. We study the redshift
dependence of the SHM relation and show that, for low mass halos, the SHM ratio
is lower at higher redshift. The derived SHM relation is used to predict the
stellar mass dependent galaxy CF and bias at high redshift. Our model predicts
that not only are massive galaxies more biased than low mass ones at all
redshifts, but the bias increases more rapidly with increasing redshift for
massive galaxies than for low mass ones. We present convenient fitting
functions for the SHM relation as a function of redshift, the conditional mass
function, and the bias as a function of stellar mass and redshift.

from GUT and string theoretic models with an inflationary phase below the

solution, but with breakage events resulting from confined monopoles (beads)
being pair produced and accelerated apart. We find these ultra-relativistic
beads to be a potent source of gravitational waves bursts, detectable by
Initial LIGO, Advanced LIGO, and LISA. Indeed, Advanced LIGO could observe
bursts from strings with tensions as low as $G\mu \sim 10^{-12}$. In addition,
we find that ultra-relativistic beads produce a scale-invariant stochastic
background detectable by LIGO, LISA, and pulsar timing experiments. The
stochastic background is scale invariant up to Planckian frequencies. This
phenomenology provides new constraints and signatures of cosmic strings that
disappear long before the present day.

and ground-based networks are and will be collecting stellar pulsation data
with unprecedented accuracy. A significant fraction of the stars in which
pulsations are observed are rotating rapidly.
  Aims: Our aim is to characterise pulsation modes in rapidly rotating stellar
models so as to be able to interpret asteroseismic data from such stars.
  Methods: The pulsation code developed in Ligni\`eres et al. (2006) and Reese
et al. (2006) is applied to stellar models based on the self-consistent field
(SCF) method (Jackson et al. 2004, 2005, MacGregor et al. 2007).
  Results: Pulsation modes in SCF models follow a similar behaviour to those in
uniformly rotating polytropic models, provided that the rotation profile is not
too differential. Pulsation modes fall into different categories, the three
main ones being island, chaotic, and whispering gallery modes, which are
rotating counterparts to modes with low, medium, and high l-|m| values,
respectively. The frequencies of the island modes follow an asymptotic pattern
quite similar to what was found for polytropic models. Extending this
asymptotic formula to higher azimuthal orders reveals more subtle behaviour as
a function of m and provides a first estimate of the average advection of
pulsation modes by rotation. Further calculations based on a variational
principle confirm this estimate and provide rotation kernels that could be used
in inversion methods. When the rotation profile becomes highly differential, it
becomes more and more difficult to find island and whispering gallery modes at
low azimuthal orders. At high azimuthal orders, whispering gallery modes, and
in some cases island modes, reappear.

the evolution of the mean size and the comoving mass density of massive
early-type galaxies from z=2 to the present. First we demonstrate that some
size evolution of the population can be expected simply due to the continuous
emergence of early-type galaxies. SDSS data reveal that in the present-day
universe more compact early-type galaxies with a given dynamical mass have
older stellar populations. In contrast, at a given stellar velocity dispersion,
SDSS data show that there is no relation between size and age, which implies
that the velocity dispersion can be used to estimate the epoch at which
galaxies stopped forming stars, turning into early-type galaxies. Applying such
a 'formation' criterion to a large sample of nearby early-type galaxies, we
predict the redshift evolution in the size distribution and the comoving mass
density. The resulting evolution in the mean size is roughly half of the
observed evolution. Then we include a prescription for the merger histories of
galaxies between the 'formation' redshift and the present, based on
cosmological simulations of the assembly of dark matter halos. Such mergers
after the transformation into an early-type galaxy are presumably
dissipationless ('dry'), where the increase in size is expected to be
approximately proportional to the increase in mass. This model successfully
reproduces the observed evolution since z~2 in the mean size and in the
comoving mass density of massive early-type galaxies. We conclude that the
recently measured, substantial size evolution of early-type galaxies can be
explained by the combined effect of the continuous emergence of galaxies as
early types and their subsequent growth through dry merging.

to an exact Markov Random Field MRF modelling. A prior information composed of

model; this encoding is optimized with respect to an approximate decoding
procedure LBP, which is used to infer hidden variables from an observed subset.
We focus on the situation where the underlying data have many different
statistical components, representing a variety of independent patterns.
Considering a single parameter family of models we show how LBP may be used to
encode and decode efficiently such information, without solving the NP hard
inverse problem yielding the optimal MRF. Contrary to usual practice, we work
in the non-convex Bethe free energy minimization framework, and manage to
associate a belief propagation fixed point to each component of the underlying
probabilistic mixture. The mean field limit is considered and yields an exact
connection with the Hopfield model at finite temperature and steady state, when
the number of mixture components is proportional to the number of variables. In
addition, we provide an enhanced learning procedure, based on a straightforward
multi-parameter extension of the model in conjunction with an effective
continuous optimization procedure. This is performed using the stochastic
search heuristic CMAES and yields a significant improvement with respect to the

Blandford & Znajek (1977) (the 'BZ' model) and Meier (1999); a parameterization
for bounds in the context of other models is suggested. The bounds obtained for
very powerful classical double radio sources in the BZ model are consistent
with black hole spins of order unity for sources at high redshift. The black
hole spins are largest for the highest redshift sources and decrease for
sources at lower redshift; the sources studied have redshifts between zero and
two. Lower power radio sources associated with central dominant galaxies may
have black hole spins that are significantly less than one. Combining this
analysis with other results suggests that the maximum values of black hole spin
associated with powerful radio galaxies decline from values of order unity at a
redshift of 2 to values of order 0.7 at a redshift of zero, while lower power

failure of these methods in the case of odd primes p. This failure gives rise
to a candidate for the localization at odd primes p of the double loop space of

this apparent discrepancy as a warning bell pointing to us that time as we
understand it, might not be fundamental and that whatever theory, lying beyond
General Relativity, may not include time as we know it as a fundamental
structure. We propose therefore, following the philosophy of analog models of
gravity, that time and gravity might not be fundamental per se, but only
emergent features. We illustrate our proposal using a toy-model where we show
how the Lorentzian signature and Nordstroem gravity (a diffeomorphisms

correlation length displaying two regimes: an initial thermally dominated
power-law growth which crosses over, at a static temperature-dependent
correlation length $L_T \sim T^3$, to a logarithmic growth consistent with an
algebraic growth of barriers. We present a scaling arguments to deal with the
crossover-induced geometrical and dynamical effects. This analysis allows to
explain why the results of most numerical studies so far have been described
with effective power-laws and also permits to determine the observed anomalous
temperature-dependence of the characteristic growth exponents. We argue that a
similar mechanism should be at work in other disordered systems. We generalize
the Family-Vicsek stationary scaling law to describe the roughness by
incorporating the waiting-time dependence or age of the initial configuration.
The analysis of the two-time linear response and correlation functions shows
that a well-defined effective temperature exists in the power-law regime.

mass and radius, and are now sampling the domain of superEarths (1-3 Earth
radii). Recent results from the Doppler surveys suggest that discovery of a
transiting superEarth in the habitable zone of a lower main sequence star may
be possible. We evaluate the prospects for an all-sky transit survey targeted
to the brightest stars, that would find the most favorable cases for
photometric and spectroscopic characterization using the James Webb Space
Telescope (JWST). We use the proposed Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite
(TESS) as representative of an all-sky survey. We couple the simulated TESS
yield to a sensitivity model for the MIRI and NIRSpec instruments on JWST. We
focus on the TESS planets with radii between Earth and Neptune. Our simulations
consider secondary eclipse filter photometry using JWST/MIRI, comparing the 11-
and 15-micron bands to measure CO2 absorption in superEarths, as well as
JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy of water absorption from 1.7-3.0 microns, and CO2
absorption at 4.3-microns. We project that TESS will discover about eight
nearby habitable transiting superEarths. The principal sources of uncertainty
in the prospects for JWST characterization of habitable superEarths are
superEarth frequency and the nature of superEarth atmospheres. Based on our
estimates of these uncertainties, we project that JWST will be able to measure
the temperature, and identify molecular absorptions (water, CO2) in one to four
nearby habitable TESS superEarths.

with intermixing using kinetic Monte Carlo is presented. The model used is
based on a solid-on-solid bond counting formulation in which elastic effects
are incorporated using a ball and spring model. While idealized, this model
nevertheless captures many aspects of heteroepitaxial growth, including
nucleation, surface diffusion, and long range effects due elastic interaction.
The algorithm combines a fast evaluation of the elastic displacement field with
an efficient implementation of a rejection-reduced kinetic Monte Carlo based on
using upper bounds for the rates. The former is achieved by using a multigrid
method for global updates of the displacement field and an expanding box method
for local updates. The simulations show the importance of intermixing on the

universe may be so large that any laboratory, no matter how precisely it is
defined by its internal state, may exist in a large number of very distantly
separated copies throughout the vast universe. In this case, no observer within
the universe can distinguish all possible outcomes for all copies of the

that the gas motions contribute up to ~ 5%-15% of the total pressure support in

would not be accounted for in hydrostatic estimates of the total mass profile

mass can be recovered accurately if pressure due to gas motions measured in
simulations is explicitly taken into account in the equation of hydrostatic
equilibrium. Given that the underestimate of mass is increasing at larger
radii, where gas is less relaxed and contribution of gas motions to pressure is
larger, the total density profile derived from hydrostatic analysis is more
concentrated than the true profile. This may at least partially explain some
high values of concentrations of clusters estimated from hydrostatic analysis

the propagation of torsional wave. Since every medium has damping so it is more
realistic to use the damped wave equation instead of the undamped wave
equation. The study also shows that the velocity of propagation of such waves
depend on the presence of initial stress. The influences of damping and initial

ellipticals are consistent with previous studies, but the intrinsic scatter
recovered for spirals is significantly larger. The scatter inferred reinforces
the need for its consideration when calculating local black hole mass function
based on the M-sigma relation, and further implies that there may be
substantial selection bias in studies of the evolution of the M-sigma relation.
We estimate the M-L relationship as log(M_BH / M_sun) = alpha + beta * log(L_V

insensitive to a wide range of assumptions about the measurement errors and the

larger mean masses, larger slopes, and incorrect intrinsic residuals.

anisotropic energy cascade and dissipation of astrophysical turbulence. With
the diffusion approximation and linear dissipation rates, we study the cascade
and damping of Alfv\'en-cyclotron fluctuations in solar plasmas numerically.
For an isotropic case the steady-state turbulence spectra are nearly isotropic
in the inertial range and can be fitted by a single power-law function with a
spectral index of -3/2, similar to the Iroshnikov-Kraichnan phenomenology.
Beyond the MHD regime the kinetic effects make the spectrum softer at higher
wavenumbers. In the dissipation range the turbulence spectrum cuts off at the
wavenumber, where the damping rate becomes comparable to the cascade rate, and
the cutoff wavenumber changes with the wave propagation direction. The angle
averaged turbulence spectrum of the isotropic model resembles a broken
power-law. Taking into account the Doppler effects, the model naturally
reproduces the broken power-law turbulence spectra observed in the solar wind
and predicts that a higher break frequency always comes along with a softer
dissipation range spectrum that may be caused by the increase of the turbulence
intensity, the reciprocal of the plasma \beta, and/or the angle between the
solar wind velocity and the mean magnetic field. These predictions can be
tested by detailed comparisons with more accurate observations.

estimate a global cluster SFR of 910\pm320 M_sun/yr within 3 Mpc of the cluster

activity in A1758 is therefore comparable with that in Cl 0024+1654, the most
active cluster previously studied at 24um. The obscured galaxies faithfully
trace the cluster potential as revealed by the weak-lensing mass map of the
cluster, including numerous mass peaks at R~2-3Mpc that are likely associated
with infalling galaxy groups and filamentary structures. However the core
(R<500kpc) of A1758N is 2x more active in the IR than that of A1758S, likely
reflecting differences in the recent dynamical history of the two clusters. The
24micron results from A1758 therefore suggest that dust-obscured cluster
galaxies are common in merging clusters and suggests that obscured activity in
clusters is triggered by both the details of cluster-cluster mergers and
processes that operate at larger radii including those within in-falling
groups. Our ongoing far-UV through far-IR observations of a large sample of

version of topological covering dimension based on a modification of the
earlier concept of decomposition rank. Our notion behaves well with respect to
inductive limits, tensor products, hereditary subalgebras (hence ideals),
quotients, and even extensions. It can be computed for many examples; in
particular, it is finite for all UCT Kirchberg algebras. In fact, all classes
of nuclear C*-algebras which have so far been successfully classified consist
of examples with finite nuclear dimension, and it turns out that finite nuclear
dimension implies many properties relevant for the classification program.
Surprisingly, the concept is also linked to coarse geometry, since for a
discrete metric space of bounded geometry the nuclear dimension of the
associated uniform Roe algebra is dominated by the asymptotic dimension of the
underlying space.

$H^j(M;\Z) = H^j(\CP^n;\Z)$ for all $j$? Is the total Chern class of $M$
determined by the cohomology ring $H^*(M;\Z)$? We answer these questions in the
six dimensional case by showing that $H^j(M;\Z)$ is equal to $H^j(\CP^3;\Z)$
for all $j$, by proving that only four cohomology rings can arise, and by
computing the total Chern class in each case. We also prove that there are no
exotic actions. More precisely, if $H^*(M;\Z)$ is isomorphic to $H^*(\CP^3;\Z)$
or $H^*(\Tilde{G}_2(\R^5);\Z)$, then the representations at the fixed
components are compatible with one of the standard actions; in the remaining
two case, the representation is strictly determined by the cohomology ring.
Finally, our results suggest a natural question: do the remaining two
cohomology rings actually arise? This question is closely related to some
interesting problems in symplectic topology, such as embeddings of ellipsoids.

anisotropies rely on accurate theoretical calculations of the cosmic
recombination history. Recent work has emphasized the importance of radiative
transfer calculations due to the high optical depth in the HI Lyman lines.
Transfer in the Lyman-alpha line is dominated by true emission and absorption,
Hubble expansion, and resonant scattering. Resonant scattering causes photons
to diffuse in frequency due to random kicks from the thermal velocities of
hydrogen atoms, and also to drift toward lower frequencies due to energy loss
via atomic recoil. Past analyses of Lyman-alpha transfer during the
recombination era have either considered a subset of these processes, ignored
time dependence, or incorrectly assumed identical emission and absorption
profiles. We present here a fully time-dependent radiative transfer calculation
of the Lyman-alpha line including all of these processes, and compare it to
previous results that ignored the resonant scattering. We find a faster
recombination due to recoil enhancement of the Lyman-alpha escape rate, leading
to a reduction in the free electron density of 0.45% at z=900. This results in
an increase in the small-scale CMB power spectrum that is negligible for the
current data but will be a 0.9 sigma correction for Planck. We discuss the
reasons why we find a smaller correction than some other recent computations.

galaxy clustering in redshift space. It is found that if galaxies are aligned
by large-scale tidal fields, then these selection effects give rise to a
dependence of the observed galaxy density on the local tidal field, in addition
to the well-known dependences on the matter density and radial velocity
gradient. This alters the galaxy power spectrum in a way that is different for
Fourier modes parallel to and perpendicular to the line of sight. These tidal
galaxy alignments can thus mimic redshift space distortions, and thus result in
a bias in the measurement of the velocity power spectrum. If galaxy
orientations are affected only by the local tidal field, then the tidal
alignment effect has exactly the same scale and angular dependence as the
redshift space distortions in the linear regime, so it cannot be projected out
or removed by masking small scales in the analysis. We consider several toy
models of tidal alignments and orientation-dependent selection, normalize their
free parameter (an amplitude) to recent observations, and find that they could
bias the velocity amplitude f(z)G(z) by 5--10 per cent in some models, although
most models give much smaller contamination. We conclude that tidal alignments
may be a significant systematic error in redshift space distortion measurements
that aim to test general relativity via the growth of large-scale structure. We
briefly discuss possible mitigation strategies.

diffusion for spin-polarized electrons are observed. Initially, the rate of
spin diffusion is similar to that of density diffusion and is controlled by the
ambipolar diffusion coefficient. At later times, the spin diffusion slows down
considerably relative to the density diffusion and appears to be controlled by
a non-constant (decreasing) spin diffusion coefficient. We suggest that the
long-time behavior of the spin density can be understood in terms of an
inhomogeneous spin relaxation rate, which grows with decreasing density. The
behavior of the spin relaxation rate is consistent with a model of
D'yakonov-Perel' relaxation limited by the Coulomb scattering between carriers.

fields, when George Ellery Hale recorded the Zeeman splitting of spectral lines
in sunspots. With the introduction of Babcock's photoelectric magnetograph it
soon became clear that the Sun's magnetic field outside sunspots is extremely
structured. The field strengths that were measured were found to get larger
when the spatial resolution was improved. It was therefore necessary to come up
with methods to go beyond the spatial resolution limit and diagnose the
intrinsic magnetic-field properties without dependence on the quality of the
telescope used. The line-ratio technique that was developed in the early 1970s
revealed a picture where most flux that we see in magnetograms originates in
highly bundled, kG fields with a tiny volume filling factor. This led to
interpretations in terms of discrete, strong-field magnetic flux tubes embedded
in a rather field-free medium, and a whole industry of flux tube models at
increasing levels of sophistication. This magnetic-field paradigm has now been
shattered with the advent of high-precision imaging polarimeters that allow us
to apply the so-called ""Second Solar Spectrum"" to diagnose aspects of solar
magnetism that have been hidden to Zeeman diagnostics. It is found that the
bulk of the photospheric volume is seething with intermediately strong, tangled
fields. In the new paradigm the field behaves like a fractal with a high degree
of self-similarity, spanning about 8 orders of magnitude in scale size, down to
scales of order 10 m.

The method converts a set of visually-inspected classifications for each galaxy

describes our confidence that the system is part of an ongoing merger. We
describe how $f_m$ is used to create a catalogue of 3003 visually-selected

$90^\circ$ gradual rotation. Such an interpretation applies our understanding
of solar wind-comet interactions to determine the \textit{in situ} IMF

evolution of a population density. In the first model a Laplace term represents
the mutations. In the second one we model the mutations by an integral kernel.
In both cases, we use a nonlinear birth-death term that corresponds to the
competition between the traits leading to selection. In the limit of rare or
small mutations, we prove that the solution converges to a sum of moving Dirac
masses. This limit is described by a constrained Hamilton-Jacobi equation. This
was already proved by B. Perthame and G. Barles for the case with a Laplace
term. Here we generalize the assumptions on the initial data and prove the same
result for the integro-differential equation.

has been the common approach so far to Banach space structures in continuous

not apply (i.e., when the unit ball is not a definable set). We also introduce
the process of single point \emph{emboundment} (closely related to the
topological single point compactification), allowing to bring unbounded
structures back into the setting of bounded continuous first order logic.
Together with results from \cite{BenYaacov:Perturbations} regarding
perturbations of bounded metric structures, we prove a Ryll-Nardzewski style
characterisation of theories of Banach spaces which are separably categorical
up to small perturbation of the norm. This last result is motivated by an

the actual classical upper bound for d less than or equal to 13 (including
non-prime values of d). We further determine that for prime value d in this
range, most of these probability and correlation inequalities are tight, i.e.,
facet-inducing for the respective classical correlation polytope. Stronger
lower and upper bounds on the quantum violation of these inequalities are
obtained. In particular, we prove that once the probability inequalities are
given, their correlation counterparts given by Ji and co-workers are no longer
relevant in terms of detecting the entanglement of a quantum state.

spin-density-wave (SDW) transition in the parent compound is suppressed and
superconductivity emerges. The maximum superconducting transition temperature
is found at 13.5 K with the doping level of x = 0.7. The temperature dependence
of DC magnetization confirms superconducting transitions at around 12 K. Our
results indicate that similar to non-isoelectronic substitution, isoelectronic

simple model of out-of-equilibrium statistical physics, is known to be
integrable. In particular, its spectrum can be described in terms of Bethe
roots. The large deviation function of the current can be obtained as well by
diagonalizing a modified transition matrix, that is still integrable: the
spectrum of this new matrix can be also described in terms of Bethe roots for
special values of the parameters. However, due to the algebraic framework used
to write the Bethe equations in the previous works, the nature of the
excitations and the full structure of the eigenvectors were still unknown. This
paper explains why the eigenvectors of the modified transition matrix are
physically relevant, gives an explicit expression for the eigenvectors and
applies it to the study of atypical currents. It also shows how the coordinate
Bethe Ansatz developped for the excitations leads to a simple derivation of the
Bethe equations and of the validity conditions of this Ansatz. All the results
obtained by de Gier and Essler are recovered and the approach gives a physical
interpretation of the exceptional points The overlap of this approach with
other tools such as the matrix Ansatz is also discussed. The method that is
presented here may be not specific to the asymmetric exclusion process and may
be applied to other models with open boundaries to find similar exceptional
points.
