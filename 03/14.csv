Gaudi","Galaxy Orientation and Alignment Effects in the SDSS DR6","58 pages, 25 figures, submitted to ApJ",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We identify, categorize, and quantify alignment effects among host and
satellite galaxies using a spectroscopically-confirmed, low-redshift (z<0.23)
galaxy sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 6. Consistent with
other recent findings, we find that satellite galaxies (SGs) of red, centrally
concentrated (elliptical) host galaxies (HGs) with radial velocity separation
|Delta_V|<600 km/s preferentially reside near the projected major axes of their
HGs. Among these, this preference is strongest for highly concentrated, red
SGs. We find that fractional anisotropy increases with decreasing \Delta_V and
Delta_R and is nearly 40% greater among the closest SGs (Delta_R<250 kpc/h)
relative to more distant (Delta_R>500 kpc/h) SGs. For highly concentrated SGs
at small (<300 kpc/h) projected separation, we observe a strong radial
(hostward) alignment signal in isophotal position angles (PAs) due to isophotal
twisting and contamination that is not present when using galaxy model PAs.
Among objects for which both isophotal and galaxy model PAs agree to <15
degrees, this elongation signal is significantly weaker. We also investigate
the ""Holmberg Effect,"" a well-known result wherein nearby (<40 kpc/h) SGs of
large, inclined spiral HGs were seen to preferentially reside near the minor
axes of their HGs. Survey limitations preclude a strict test of this effect
using only SDSS spectroscopic galaxies. By adopting a looser set of cuts than
those of Holmberg's study, we recover a comparable preference among faint blue
SGs for the HG minor axis at marginal significance (~3 sigma). We conclude that
several types of alignment likely exist among different galaxy populations, but
that the observed nature and strength of alignment trends depend sensitively on
both selection criteria and on the method used to determine galaxy orientation.

dynamics driven by a spin-polarized current in a point contact geometry for the
case of a relatively large contact diameter (D = 80 nm) and small external
field (H = 30 Oe). We show, that under these conditions the magnetization
dynamics is qualitatively different from the dynamics observed for small
contacts in large external fields. In particular, the 'bullet' mode with a
homogeneous mode core, which was the dominating localized mode for small
contacts, is not found here. Instead, all localized oscillation modes observed
in simulations correspond to different motion kinds of vortex-antivortex (V-AV)
pairs. These kinds include rotational and translational motion of pairs with
the V-AV distance d ~ D and creation/annihilation of much smaller (satellite)
V-AV pairs. We also show that for the geometry studied here the Oersted field
has a qualitative effect on the magnetization dynamics of a 'free' layer. This
effect offers a possibility to control magnetization dynamics by a suitable
electric contact setup, optimized to produce a desired Oersted field. Finally,
we demonstrate that when the magnetization dynamics of the 'fixed' layer
(induced only by the stray field interaction with the 'free' layer) is taken
into account, the threshold current for the oscillation onset is drastically
reduced and new types of localized modes appear. In conclusion, we show that
our simulations reproduce semiquantitatively several important features of the

long-baseline interferometers or sparse aperture telescopes in space, since the
aperture diameters required are in excess of 500 m - a regime in which
monolithic or segmented designs are not and will not be feasible - and since
they require observations at wavelengths (UV) not accessible from the ground.
Two mission concepts which could provide these invaluable observations are
NASA's Stellar Imager (SI; http://hires.gsfc.nasa.gov/si/) interferometer and
ESA's Luciola sparse aperture hypertelescope, which each could resolve hundreds
of stars and stellar systems. These observatories will also open an immense new
discovery space for astrophysical research in general and, in particular, for
Active Galactic Nuclei (Kraemer et al. Decadal Survey Science Whitepaper). The
technology developments needed for these missions are challenging, but
eminently feasible (Carpenter et al. Decadal Survey Technology Whitepaper) with
a reasonable investment over the next decade to enable flight in the 2025+

results demonstrate that the torsional crust modes are essentially unaffected
by the coupling to the gravitational field. This is as expected since these
oscillations are known to be weak gravitational-wave sources. In contrast, the
presence of a loosely coupled superfluid neutron component in the crust can
have a significant effect on the oscillation spectrum. We show that the
entrainment between the superfluid and the crust nuclei is a key parameter in
the problem. Our analysis highlights the need for a more detailed understanding
of the coupled crust-superfluid at the microphysical level. Our numerical
results have, even though we have not considered magnetised stars, some
relevance for efforts to carry out seismology based on quasi-periodic
oscillations observed in the tails of magnetar flares. In particular, we argue
that the sensitive dependence on the entrainment may have to be accounted for

complete sample of 16 Giga-Hertz Peaked Spectrum (GPS) galaxies. This study
addresses three basic questions in our understanding of the nature and
evolution of GPS sources: a) What is the physical origin of the X-ray emission
in GPS galaxies? b) What physical system is associated with the X-ray
obscuration? c) What is the ""endpoint"" of the evolution of compact radio
sources? We obtain a 100% (94%) detection fraction in the 0.5-2 keV (0.5-10
keV) energy band. GPS galaxy X-ray spectra are typically highly obscured. The
X-ray column density is higher than the HI column density measured in the radio
by a factor of 10 to 100. GPS galaxies lie well on the extrapolation to high
radio powers of the correlation between radio and X-ray luminosity known in
low-luminosity FRI radio galaxies. On the other hand, GPS galaxies exhibit a
comparable X-ray luminosity to FRII radio galaxies, notwithstanding their much
higher radio luminosity. The X-ray to radio luminosity ratio distribution in
our sample is consistent with the bulk of the high-energy emission being
produced by the accretion disk, as well as with dynamical models of GPS
evolution where X-rays are produced by Compton upscattering of ambient photons.
Further support for the former scenario comes from the location of GPS galaxies
in the X-ray to O[III] luminosity ratio versus column density plane. We propose
that GPS galaxies are young radio sources, which would reach their full
maturity as classical FRII radio galaxies. However, column densities ~10^{22}
atoms/cm/cm could lead to a significant underestimate of dynamical age
determinations based on the hotspot recession velocity measurements. (abridged)

distinguish among intermediate probability values. We present a symbolic,
polynomial time model-checking algorithm for QRCTL on MDPs.
  The logic QRCTL induces an equivalence relation over states of an MDP that we
call qualitative equivalence: informally, two states are qualitatively
equivalent if the sets of formulas that hold with probability 0 or 1 at the two
states are the same. We show that for finite alternating MDPs, where
nondeterministic and probabilistic choices occur in different states,
qualitative equivalence coincides with alternating bisimulation, and can thus
be computed via efficient partition-refinement algorithms. On the other hand,
in non-alternating MDPs the equivalence relations cannot be computed via
partition-refinement algorithms, but rather, they require non-local
computation. Finally, we consider QRCTL*, that extends QRCTL with nested
temporal operators in the same manner in which CTL* extends CTL. We show that
QRCTL and QRCTL* induce the same qualitative equivalence on alternating MDPs,
while on non-alternating MDPs, the equivalence arising from QRCTL* can be
strictly finer. We also provide a full characterization of the relation between
qualitative equivalence, bisimulation, and alternating bisimulation, according
to whether the MDPs are finite, and to whether their transition relations are
finitely-branching.

planets in short-period, potentially habitable orbits around low-mass stars
(M_star < 0.3 M_sun). We then investigate the feasibility of detecting these
Earth-sized planets. Our simulations of terrestrial planet formation follow the
growth of planetary embryos in an annular region around a fiducial M7 primary.
Our simulations couple a semi-analytic model to a full N-body integration to
follow the growth from ~3x10^21 g to the final planetary system configurations
that generally consist of 3-5 planets with masses of order 0.1 - 1.0 M_earth in
or near the habitable zone of the star. To obtain a concrete estimate of the
detectability of the planets arising in our simulations, we present a detailed
Monte-Carlo transit detection simulation. We find that detection of 1 R_earth
planets around the local M-dwarfs is challenging for a 1m class ground-based
photometric search, but that detection of planets of larger radius is a
distinct possibility. The detection of Earth-sized planets is straightforward,
however, with an all-sky survey by a low-cost satellite mission. Given a
reduced correlated noise level of 0.45 mmag and an intermediate planetary
ice-mass fraction of planets orbiting a target list drawn from the nearest
late-type M dwarfs, a ground-based photometric search could detect, on average,
0.8 of these planets with an extended search. A space-based photometric search
(similar to the TESS mission) should discover ~17 of these Earth-sized planets
during it's two year survey, with an assumed occurrence fraction of 28%.

diversity benefits of such techniques. This paper, instead, considers the
multiplexing benefits of cooperative communications. First, a new
interpretation on the fundamental tradeoff between the transmission rate and
outage probability in multi-antenna relay networks is given. It follows that
multiplexing gains can be obtained at any finite SNR, in full-duplex
multi-antenna relay networks. Thus relaying can offer not only stronger link
reliability, but also higher spectral efficiency.
  Specifically, the decode-and-forward protocol is applied and networks that
have one source, one destination, and multiple relays are considered. A receive
power gain at the relays, which captures the network large scale fading
characteristics, is also considered. It is shown that this power gain can
significantly affect the system diversity-multiplexing tradeoff for any finite
SNR value. Several relaying protocols are proposed and are shown to offer
nearly the same outage probability as if the transmit antennas at the source
and the relay(s) were co-located, given certain SNR and receive power gains at
the relays. Thus a higher multiplexing gain than that of the direct link can be
obtained if the destination has more antennas than the source.
  Much of the analysis in the paper is valid for arbitrary channel fading
statistics. These results point to a view of relay networks as a means for
providing higher spectral efficiency, rather than only link reliability.

much as a factor ~6 smaller than low-z galaxies of comparable mass. Given the
apparent absence of low-z counterparts, this has often been interpreted as
indicating that the high density, compact red galaxies must be 'puffed up' by
some mechanism. We compare the ensemble of high-z observations with large
samples of well-observed low-z ellipticals. At the same physical radii, the
stellar surface mass densities of low and high-z systems are comparable.
Moreover, the abundance of high surface density material at low redshift is
comparable to or larger than that observed at z>1-2, consistent with the
continuous buildup of spheroids over this time. The entire population of
compact, high-z red galaxies may be the progenitors of the high-density cores
of present-day ellipticals, with no need for a decrease in stellar density from
z=2 to z=0. The primary difference between low and high-z systems is thus the
observed low-density material at large radii in low-z spheroids (rather than
the high-density material in high-z spheroids). Such low-density material may
either (1) assemble at z<2 or (2) be present, but not yet detected, at z>2.
Mock observations of low-z massive systems show that the high-z observations do
not yet probe sufficiently low surface brightness material to detect the low
surface density 'wings' (if present). Thus, if the high-z galaxies resemble the
most massive systems today, their inferred effective radii could be
under-estimated by factors ~2-4. This difference arises because massive systems
at low redshift are not well-fit by single Sersic profiles. We discuss
implications of our results for physical models of galaxy evolution.

two, two and three shells, respectively. The most critical aspects in the
development of the Simbol-X mirrors are i) the production of the 100 mandrels
with very good surface quality within the timeline of the mission; ii) the
replication of shells that must be very thin (a factor of 2 thinner than those

development of an integration process that allows us to integrate these very
thin mirrors maintaining their intrinsic good image quality. The Phase A study
has shown that we can fabricate the mandrels with the needed quality and that
we have developed a valid integration process. The shells that we have produced
so far have a quite good image quality, e.g. HEW <~30 arcsec at 30 keV, and
effective area. However, we still need to make some improvements to reach the
requirements. We will briefly present these results and discuss the possible

a relativistic mass m is dynamically generated and derive a gap equation for

of the model, such as the specific heat and spin response, which clearly show
non-Fermi liquid properties. We find that various physical properties are
suppressed at temperatures T< T* where the cross-over scale is T* = m. As a
simplified, toy model of high Tc superconductivity, we thus identify the
pseudogap energy scale with the zero temperature relativistic mass m, and show
that this reproduces some qualitative aspects of the observed phenomenology of
the pseudogap. The effects of the pseudogap and finite temperature on the
d-wave gap equation are analyzed. In this model, the pseudogap is a distinct
phenomenon from superconductivity and in fact competes with it. Our analysis of
Tc suggests that the quantum critical point of our model, where the pseudogap
vanishes, occurs inside the superconducting dome near optimal doping. For an
antiferromagnetic exchange energy of J/k_B ~ 1350K, solutions of the d-wave gap
equation give a maximum Tc of about 110K.

have been able to test the parallelization over characteristics. Using 512^2
momentum angles we ran the code on 16,384 Opteron processors and achieved

followup near-IR spectroscopy, and an additional 3-6 candidate supergiant
embers having IR photometry consistent with a similar distance and reddening.
The cluster lies at a local minimum in the 13-CO column density and 8 micron
emission. We interpret this feature as a hole carved by the energetic winds of
the evolving massive stars. The 13-CO hole seen in molecular maps at V_LSR ~95
km/s corresponds to near/far kinematic distances of 6.1/8.7+/-1 kpc. We
calculate a mean spectrophotometric distance of 7.0^+3.7_-2.4 kpc, broadly
consistent with the kinematic distances inferred. This location places it near
the northern end of the Galactic bar. For the mean extinction of A_V=12.6+/-0.5
mag (A_K=1.5+/-0.1 mag), the color-magnitude diagram of probable cluster
members is well fit by isochrones in the age range 18-24 Myr. The estimated
cluster mass is ~20,000 Msun. With the most massive original cluster stars
likely deceased, no strong radio emission is detected in this vicinity. As
such, this RSG cluster is representative of adolescent massive Galactic
clusters that lie hidden behind many magnitudes of dust obscuration. This
cluster joins two similar red supergiant clusters as residents of the volatile
region where the end of our Galaxy's bar joins the base of the Scutum-Crux

such an estimate has been known for more than a century due to classical
results of W. Sierpinski and J.G. van der Corput. Our proof combines the method

potential signal amplification mechanism in nanomechanical two-state systems.
While white noise represents the archetypal stimulus for stochastic resonance,
typical operating environments for nanomechanical devices often contain
different classes of noise, particularly colored noise with a 1/f spectrum. As
a result, improved understanding of the effects of noise color will be helpful
in maximizing device performance. Here we report measurements of stochastic
resonance in a silicon nanomechanical resonator using 1/f noise and
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise types. Power spectral densities and residence time
distributions provide insight into asymmetry of the bistable amplitude states,
and the data sets suggest that 1/f^alpha noise spectra with increasing noise
color (i.e. alpha) may lead to increasing asymmetry in the system, reducing the
achievable amplification. Furthermore, we explore the effects of correlation
time tau on stochastic resonance with the use of exponentially correlated
noise. We find monotonic suppression of the spectral amplification as the

annealed films show atomic terraces at all temperatures and are found to be
electronically homogeneous in 78-300K temperature range. At high temperatures
(T$>$T$_{CO}\approx$ 230 K) the local tunnel spectra of the annealed films show
a depression in the density of states (DOS) near Fermi energy implying a
pseudogap with a significant DOS at E$_F$. The gap feature becomes more robust
with cooling with a sharp jump in DOS at E$_F$ at T$_{CO}$ and with a gap value
of $\sim$0.3 eV at 78K. At low temperatures we find a small but finite DOS at
E$_F$ indicative of some delocalized carriers in the CO phase together with an
energy gap. This is consistent with bulk transport, which shows weakening of

more complicated than previous days. During airlines daily operations,
assigning the available gates to the arriving aircrafts based on the fixed
schedule is a very important issue, which motivates researchers to study and
solve Airport Gate Assignment Problems (AGAP) with all kinds of
state-of-the-art combinatorial optimization techniques. In this paper, we study
the AGAP and propose a novel hybrid mathematical model based on the method of
constraint programming and 0 - 1 mixed-integer programming. With the objective
to minimize the number of gate conflicts of any two adjacent aircrafts assigned
to the same gate, we build a mathematical model with logical constraints and
the binary constraints. For practical considerations, the potential objective
of the model is also to minimize the number of gates that airlines must lease
or purchase in order to run their business smoothly. We implement the model in
the Optimization Programming Language (OPL) and carry out empirical studies
with the data obtained from online timetable of Continental Airlines, Houston
Gorge Bush Intercontinental Airport IAH, which demonstrate that our model can
provide an efficient evaluation criteria for the airline companies to estimate
the efficiency of their current gate assignments.

quantum scattering: the stationary phase method and its relation with delay
times for relativistic and non-relativistic tunneling particles. We notice that
the applicability of this method is constrained by several subtleties in
deriving the phase time that describes the localization of scattered wave
packets. We investigate the general relation between phase times and dwell
times for quantum tunneling/scattering. Considering a symmetrical collision of
two identical wave packets with an one-dimensional barrier, we demonstrate that
these two distinct transit time definitions are explicitly connected. The
traversal times are obtained for a symmetrized (two identical bosons) and an
antisymmetrized (two identical fermions) quantum colliding configuration.
Multiple wave packet decomposition shows us that the phase time (group delay)
describes the exact position of the scattered particles and, in addition to the
exact relation with the dwell time, leads to correct conceptual understanding
of both transit time definitions. At last, we extend the non-relativistic
formalism to the solutions for the tunneling zone of a one-dimensional
electrostatic potential in the relativistic (Dirac to Klein-Gordon) wave
equation where the incoming wave packet exhibits the possibility of being
almost totally transmitted through the potential barrier. The conditions for
the occurrence of accelerated tunneling transmission probabilities are all
quantified and the problematic superluminal interpretation based on the
non-relativistic tunneling dynamics is revisited.

systems, MG0414+0534 and Q2237+030, using the cooled mid-infrared camera and
spectrometer (COMICS) attached on the Subaru telescope. MG0414+0534 is
characterized by a bright pair of lensed images (A1, A2) and their optical flux
ratio A2/A1 deviates significantly from the prediction of a smooth lens model.
Q2237+030 is comprised of four lensed images, which are significantly affected
by microlensing in a foreground lensing galaxy. Our mid-infrared observations
of these lensed images have revealed that the mid-infrared flux ratio for A2/A1
of MG0414+0534 is nearly unity (0.90 +- 0.04). We find that this flux ratio is
systematically small, at 4 to 5 sigma level, compared with the prediction of a
best smooth lens model (1.09) represented by a singular isothermal ellipsoid
and external shear, thereby suggesting the presence of substructures to explain
our observational result. In contrast, for Q2237+030, our high signal-to-noise
observation indicates that the mid-infrared flux ratios between all the four
images of Q2237+030 are virtually consistent with the prediction of a smooth
lens model. Based on the size estimate of the dust torus surrounding the nuclei
of these QSOs, we set limits on the mass of a substructure in these lens
systems, which can cause anomalies in the flux ratios. For MG0414+0534, since
the required mass of a substructure inside its Einstein radius is > 360 M_sun,
millilensing by a CDM substructure is most likely. If it is modeled as a
singular isothermal sphere, the mass inside radius of 100 pc is given as >
1.0x10^5 M_sun. For Q2237+030, there is no significant evidence of
millilensing, so the reported anomalous flux ratios in shorter wavelengths are
entirely caused by microlensing by stars (abridged).

and their X-ray luminosities are significantly higher. The integrated
mass-to-light ratio of each galaxy is constant at that of stars within 0.5-1
r_e, and increases with radius, where r_e is the effective radius of a galaxy.
The scatter of the central mass-to-light ratio of galaxies was less in K-band
light. At 3r_e, the integrated mass-to-light ratios of galaxies with flat or
decreasing temperature profiles are twice the value at 0.5r_e, where the

factor of two. By contrast, X-ray luminous galaxies have higher gravitational

e-dopants with p-type substitutional Mn is energetically stable in bulk Ge and
Si. Mn atoms move from interstitial sites to substitutional sites easier in the
presence of a neighboring n-type e-dopant. Magnetic coupling between two Mn
atoms in bulk Ge oscillates between positive (ferromagnetic) and negative
(antiferromagnetic) values with increasing Mn-Mn distance, but in Mn/As
co-doped Ge the coupling parameter remains positive at all distances beyond
nearest-neighbors and this qualitative difference does not change with the
doping level. For Mn doped Si, all coupling values except for the nearest
neighbor one are positive and do not change much upon co-doping. We find an
unconventional magnetic anisotropy in the co-doped system, that is, the
dependence of magnetic coupling on the relative positions of the magnetic ions
and their neighboring e-dopants. We employ Monte Carlo simulations to estimate
the Curie temperature (Tc). We find that in Mn doped Ge no ferromagnetic order
exists for Mn concentrations ranging from 3.13% to 6%. Instead, a spin-glass
phase transition occurs at ~5K at 5% Mn doping. For Mn/As co-doped Ge, Tc
increases nearly linearly with the Mn concentration and reaches 264K at 5% Mn

Branch (AGB), preplanetary nebula (PPN) and planetary nebula (PN) evolutionary
phases. Most stars that leave the main sequence in a Hubble time will end their
lives in this way. The heavy mass loss which occurs during the AGB phase is
important across astrophysics, and the particulate matter crucial for the birth
of new solar systems is made and ejected by AGB stars. Yet stellar evolution
from the beginning of the AGB phase to the PN phase remains poorly understood.
We do not understand how the mass-loss (rate, geometry, temporal history)
depends on fundamental stellar parameters or the presence of a binary
companion. While the study of evolved non-massive stars has maintained a
relatively modest profile in recent decades, we are nonetheless in the midst of
a quiet but exciting revolution in this area, driven by new observational
results, such as the discovery of jets and disks in stellar environments where
these were never expected, and by the recognition of new symmetries such as
multipolarity and point-symmetry occuring frequently in the nebulae resulting
from the outflows. In this paper we summarise the major unsolved problems in
this field, and specify the areas where allocation of effort and resources is
most likely to help make significant progress.
