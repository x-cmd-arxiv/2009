galactic nuclei (AGN). Only interferometric observations provide the necessary
angular resolution to resolve the nuclear dust and to study its distribution
and properties. The investigation of dust in AGN cores is hence one of the main
science goals for the MID-infrared Interferometric instrument MIDI at the VLTI.
As the first step, the feasibility of AGN observations was verified and the
most promising sources for detailed studies were identified. This was carried
out in a ""snapshot survey"" with MIDI using Guaranteed Time Observations. In the
survey, observations were attempted for 13 of the brightest AGN in the
mid-infrared which are visible from Paranal. The results of the three
brightest, best studied sources have been published in separate papers. Here we
present the interferometric observations for the remaining 10, fainter AGN. For
8 of these, interferometric measurements could be carried out. Size estimates
or limits on the spatial extent of the AGN-heated dust were derived from the
interferometric data of 7 AGN. These indicate that the dust distributions are
compact, with sizes on the order of a few parsec. The derived sizes roughly
scale with the square root of the luminosity in the mid-infrared, s ~ sqrt(L),
with no clear distinction between type 1 and type 2 objects. This is in
agreement with a model of nearly optically thick dust structures heated to T ~
300 K. For three sources, the 10 micron feature due to silicates is tentatively
detected either in emission or in absorption. Based on the results for all AGN
studied with MIDI so far, we conclude that in the mid-infrared the differences
between individual galactic nuclei are greater than the generic differences
between type 1 and type 2 objects.

anisotropy observed by WMAP has an anomalous dip at l~20 and bump at l~40. One
explanation for this structure is the presence of features in the primordial
curvature power spectrum, possibly caused by a step in the inflationary
potential. The detection of these features is only marginally significant from
temperature data alone. However, the inflationary feature hypothesis predicts a
specific shape for the E-mode polarization power spectrum with a structure
similar to that observed in temperature at l~20-40. Measurement of the CMB
polarization on few-degree scales can therefore be used as a consistency check
of the hypothesis. The Planck satellite has the statistical sensitivity to
confirm or rule out the model that best fits the temperature features with 3
sigma significance, assuming all other parameters are known. With a cosmic
variance limited experiment, this significance improves to 8 sigma. For tests
of inflationary models that can explain both the dip and bump in temperature,
the primary source of uncertainty is confusion with polarization features
created by a complex reionization history, which at most reduces the
significance to 2.5 sigma for Planck and 5-6 sigma for an ideal experiment.
Smoothing of the polarization spectrum by a large tensor component only
slightly reduces the ability of polarization to test for inflationary features,
as does requiring that polarization is consistent with the observed temperature
spectrum given the expected low level of TE correlation on few-degree scales. A
future polarization satellite would enable a decisive test of the feature
hypothesis and provide complementary information about the shape of a possible
step in the inflationary potential. (Abridged.)

$e^+$-$e^-$ FFs. Relative to that reference the hard component for p-p and

three different admixtures with adiabatic modes in a flat $\Lambda$CDM

correlations, we verify the WMAP analysis for fully uncorrelated and

find a small tightening of the constraint on the fractional contribution of

quite different to previous work, needing a doubling of prior space for the
isocurvature spectral index in order to explore adequately the region of high

inadequate for this particular application; instead our results are obtained

a total integrated luminosity of 1.1 fb^{-1}. The cross section is measured in
the dilepton channel, the subset of ttbar events in which both top quarks decay
through t -> Wb -> l nu b where l = e, mu, or tau. The lepton pair is
reconstructed as one identified electron or muon and one isolated track. The
use of an isolated track to identify the second lepton increases the ttbar
acceptance, particularly for the case in which one W decays as W -> tau nu. The
purity of the sample may be further improved at the cost of a reduction in the
number of signal events, by requiring an identified b-jet. We present the
results of measurements performed with and without the request of an identified
b-jet. The former is the first published CDF result for which a b-jet
requirement is added to the dilepton selection. In the CDF data there are 129
pretag lepton + track candidate events, of which 69 are tagged. With the
tagging information, the sample is divided into tagged and untagged
sub-samples, and a combined cross section is calculated by maximizing a
likelihood. The result is sigma_{ttbar} = 9.6 +/- 1.2 (stat.) -0.5 +0.6 (sys.)

variety of systems, for example to single electrons by electrostatic or
magnetic coupling, and to photons by radiation pressure or optical dipole
forces. So far, all such experiments have operated in a regime of weak
coupling, in which reversible energy exchange between the mechanical device and
its coupled partner is suppressed by fast decoherence of the individual systems
to their local environments. Controlled quantum experiments are in principle
not possible in such a regime, but instead require strong coupling. So far,
this has been demonstrated only between microscopic quantum systems, such as
atoms and photons (in the context of cavity quantum electrodynamics) or solid
state qubits and photons. Strong coupling is an essential requirement for the
preparation of mechanical quantum states, such as squeezed or entangled states,
and also for using mechanical resonators in the context of quantum information
processing, for example, as quantum transducers. Here we report the observation
of optomechanical normal mode splitting, which provides unambiguous evidence
for strong coupling of cavity photons to a mechanical resonator. This paves the
way towards full quantum optical control of nano- and micromechanical devices.

adequate feedback depends on how massive they are and how much energy they
carry, but it depends in a more fundamental way upon whether they escape the
potential of the black hole. If the outflows have reached their asymptotic
velocity when we observe them, then all of these properties critically depend
on the radius of the outflow: a value which is difficult to measure. The
tightest limit on the distance of an X-ray warm absorber from the ionizing

other observed UV outflows, and find that on the whole they may not provide
meaningful feedback. The outflow velocities are below or just above the escape
velocity of the black hole. This may be because they are not yet fully
accelerated, or the duty cycle of high-velocity outflows may be small. Another
possibility is that they may only provide meaningful feedback in

addition, the amplitude of short time scale variations is significantly
anti-correlated with black hole mass and luminosity. We interpret the optical
flux fluctuations as resulting from thermal fluctuations that are driven by an
underlying stochastic process, such as a turbulent magnetic field. In addition,
the intranight variations in optical flux implied by our empirical model are <
0.02 mag, consistent with current microvariability observations of radio-quiet
quasars. Our stochastic model is therefore able to unify both long and short

the matter distribution, through our adiabatic hydrodynamic simulation and the
one with additional gastrophysics including radiative cooling, star formation
and supernova feedback. (1) We find a strong correlation between the gas
pressure and matter distribution, with a typical cross correlation coefficient
r ~ 0.7 at k . 3h/Mpc and z < 2. This tight correlation will enable robust
cross correlation measurement between SZ surveys such as Planck, ACT and SPT
and lensing surveys such as DES and LSST, at ~20-100{\sigma} level. (2) We
propose a tomography technique to convert the measured cross correlation into
the contribution from gas in each redshift bin to the tSZ power spectrum.
Uncertainties in gastrophysics may affect the reconstruction at ~ 2% level, due
to the ~ 1% impact of gastrophysics on r, found in our simulations. However, we
find that the same gastrophysics affects the tSZ power spectrum at ~ 40% level,
so it is robust to infer the gastrophysics from the reconstructed redshift
resolved contribution.

flux implies a lower bound on the X-ray luminosity of $3 \times 10^{39} \rm erg

subtraction of the nebular emission, the continuum appears to have a power-law
form with a spectral slope of $-2.0^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$. This is similar to low-mass
X-ray binaries where the optical spectra are dominated by reprocessing of
X-rays in the outer accretion disk. In one observation, the continuum, He{\sc

we find that $(6.5 \pm 0.7) \times 10^{-3}$ of the total bolometric luminosity

10^-4 Msun/yr/kpc^-2, consistent with other new results which detect low level
star formation below the traditional Kennicutt relation in the outer parts of
spiral galaxies. The morphology of this galaxy resembles the recently
identified class of ultraviolet objects called extended ultraviolet disks, or
XUV-disks. New HI observations of this galaxy taken at the ATCA and in the CnB
array at the VLA show that the cold gas lies in an extended (diameter ~90 kpc)
ring around the central S0 galaxy. The HI data cube can be well modeled by a
warped ring. The faint ionized gas in the inner parts of the galaxy is
kinematically decoupled from the stars and instead appears to exhibit
velocities consistent with the rotation of the HI ring at larger radius. The
peak of the stellar ring, as seen in the optical and UV, is slightly displaced
to the inside relative to the peak of the HI ring. We discuss the manner in
which this offset could be caused by the propagation of a radial density wave
through an existing stellar disk, perhaps triggered by a galaxy collision at
the center of the disk, or possibly due to a spiral density wave set up at
early times in a disk too hot to form a stellar bar. Gas accretion and
resonance effects due to a bar which has since dissolved are also considered to
explain the presence of the star forming ring seen in the GALEX and deep
optical data.

portion of Taurus (where HP Tau/G2 is located) corresponds to the far side of
the complex. Previous VLBA observations have shown that T Tau, to the South of
the complex, is at an intermediate distance of about 147 pc, whereas the region
around L1495 corresponds to the near side at roughly 130 pc. Our observations
of only four sources are still too coarse to enable a reliable determination of
the three-dimensional structure of the entire Taurus star-forming complex. They
do demonstrate, however, that VLBA observations of multiple sources in a given
star-forming region have the potential not only to provide a very accurate
estimate of its mean distance, but also to reveal its internal structure. The
proper motion measurements obtained simultaneously with the parallax allowed us
to study the kinematics of the young stars in Taurus. Combining the four
observations available so far, we estimate the peculiar velocity of Taurus to
be about 10.6 km s-1 almost completely in a direction parallel to the Galactic
plane. Using our improved distance measurement, we have refined the
determination of the position on the HR diagram of HP Tau/G2, and of two other

in a harmonic trap. Within a local density approximation, the two components
phase-separate beyond a critical interaction strength, with one species having
a higher density at the trap center. We discuss several easily observable
experimental signatures of this transition. The mean field release energy, its
separate kinetic and interaction contributions, as well as the potential
energy, all depend on the interaction strength and contain a sharp signature of
this transition. In addition, the conversion rate of atoms to molecules,
arising from three-body collisions, peaks at an interaction strength just
beyond the ferromagnetic transition point. We then go beyond the local density
approximation, and derive an energy functional which includes a term that
depends on the local magnetization gradient and acts as a `surface tension'.
Using this energy functional, we numerically study the energetics of some
candidate spin textures which may be stabilized in a harmonic trapping
potential at zero net magnetization. We find that a hedgehog state has a lower
energy than an `in-out' domain wall state in an isotropic trap. Upon inclusion
of trap anisotropy we find that the hedgehog magnetization profile gets
distorted due to the surface tension term, this distortion being more apparent
for small atom numbers. We estimate that the magnetic dipole interaction does
not play a significant role in this system. We consider possible implications
for experiments on trapped Li-6 and K-40 gases.

bubbles sandwiched between a liquid bath and glass plate, as a function of
driving rate, packing fraction and degree of disorder. First, we find that
bidisperse, disordered foams exhibit strongly rate dependent and inhomogeneous
(shear banded) velocity profiles, while monodisperse, ordered foams are also
shear banded, but essentially rate independent. Second, we introduce a simple
model based on balancing the averaged drag forces between the bubbles and the
top plate and the averaged bubble-bubble drag forces. This model captures the
observed rate dependent flows, and the rate independent flows. Third, we
perform independent rheological measurements, both for ordered and disordered
systems, and find these to be fully consistent with the scaling forms of the
drag forces assumed in the simple model, and we see that disorder modifies the
scaling. Fourth, we vary the packing fraction $\phi$ of the foam over a
substantial range, and find that the flow profiles become increasingly shear
banded when the foam is made wetter. Surprisingly, our model describes flow
profiles and rate dependence over the whole range of packing fractions with the
same power law exponents -- only a dimensionless number $k$ which measures the
ratio of the pre-factors of the viscous drag laws is seen to vary with packing
fraction. We find that $k \sim (\phi-\phi_c)^{-1}$, where $\phi_c \approx
0.84$, corresponding to the 2d jamming density, and suggest that this scaling
follows from the geometry of the deformed facets between bubbles in contact.
Overall, our work suggests a route to rationalize aspects of the ubiquitous
Herschel-Bulkley (power law) rheology observed in a wide range of disordered
materials.

the returning electron wave packet is determined mostly by the laser only. The
returning electron wave packets can be obtained from the strong-field
approximation or from the solution of the time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation

checking against accurate results for both harmonic magnitude and phase from
the solution of the TDSE for atomic targets within the single active electron
approximation. Combining with accurate transition dipoles obtained from
state-of-the-art molecular photoionization calculations, we further show that
available experimental measurements for HHG from partially aligned molecules
can be explained by the QRS. Our results show that quantitative description of
the HHG from aligned molecules has become possible. Since infrared lasers of

insufficiency. A 1024-actuator 1.5-um-stroke MEMS device was empirically tested

positions, mid-to-high-spatial-frequency stroke did saturate more frequently
than expected, implying that correlations through the influence functions are

predicted by linear theory. In the non-linear regime the kink amplitude
continues to increase up to the terminal simulation time, albeit at different
rates, for all but one simulation. The growth rate and nonlinear evolution of
the CD kink instability depends moderately on the density profile and strongly
on the magnetic pitch profile. The growth rate of the kink mode is reduced in
the linear regime by an increase in the magnetic pitch with radius and the
non-linear regime is reached at a later time than for constant helical pitch.
On the other hand, the growth rate of the kink mode is increased in the linear
regime by a decrease in the magnetic pitch with radius and reaches the
non-linear regime sooner than the case with constant magnetic pitch. Kink
amplitude growth in the non-linear regime for decreasing magnetic pitch leads
to a slender helically twisted column wrapped by magnetic field. On the other
hand, kink amplitude growth in the non-linear regime nearly ceases for
increasing magnetic pitch.

Telescope (HET) in the Energetic X-ray imaging Survey Telescope (EXIST), a next
generation space-borne multi-wavelength telescope. We have constructed a large
(nearly gapless) detector plane through a modularization scheme by tiling of a
large number of 2 cm x 2 cm CZT crystals. Our innovative packaging method is
ideal for many applications such as coded-aperture imaging, where a large,
continuous detector plane is desirable for the optimal performance. Currently
we have been able to achieve an energy resolution of 3.2 keV (FWHM) at 59.6 keV
on average, which is exceptional considering the moderate pixel size and the
number of detectors in simultaneous operation. We expect to complete two
modules (512 cm2) within the next few months as more CZT becomes available. We
plan to test the performance of these detectors in a near space environment in
a series of high altitude balloon flights, the first of which is scheduled for
Fall 2009. These detector modules are the first in a series of progressively
more sophisticated detector units and packaging schemes planned for ProtoEXIST2

spectral states), such as low/hard state, high/soft state, and so on. Since the
dynamics of the corresponding flows is distinct, theoretical models were
separately discussed for each state. We here propose a unified model based on
our new, global, two-dimensional radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations. By
controlling a density normalization we could for the first time reproduce three
distinct modes of accretion flow and outflow with one numerical code. When the
density is large (model A), a geometrically thick, very luminous disk forms, in
which photon trapping takes place. When the density is moderate (model B), the
accreting gas can effectively cool by emitting radiation, thus generating a
thin disk, i.e., the soft-state disk. When the density is too low for radiative
cooling to be important (model C), a disk becomes hot, thick, and faint; i.e.,
the hard-state disk. The magnetic energy is amplified within the disk up to
about twice, 30%, and 20% of the gas energy in models A, B, and C,
respectively. Notably, the disk outflows with helical magnetic fields, which
are driven either by radiation pressure force or magnetic pressure force, are
ubiquitous in any accretion modes. Finally, our simulations are consistent with
the phenomenological alpha-viscosity prescription, that is, the disk viscosity
is proportional to the pressure.

large deformations (uniaxial traction), as a function of the concentration of

two main reinforcement effects: the filler network contribution, and a
filler-polymer matrix effect. Above a silica volume fraction threshold, we see
a divergence of the modulus correlated to the build up of a connected network.
Below the threshold, we obtain a new additional elastic contribution of much
longer terminal time than the matrix. Since aggregates are separated by at
least 60 nm, this new filler-matrix contribution cannot be described solely

originating from N and O. We found acceptable spectral fits using isothermal
APEC models with significantly increased elemental abundances of O and N for
all observations. On day 248 after outburst a bright soft component appeared in
addition to the fading emission lines. The Chandra observations on days 300,
304, and 727 were carried out with the HRC/LETGS. The spectra consist of
continuum emission plus strong emission lines of O and N, implying a high
abundance of these elements. On day 300, a flare occurred and periodic
oscillations were detected in the light curves taken on days 300 and 304. This
flare must have originated deep in the outflowing material since it was
variable on short time scales. The spectra extracted immediately before and
after the flare are remarkably similar, implying that the flare was an
extremely isolated event. Our attempts to fit blackbody, Cloudy, or APEC models
to the LETG spectra failed, owing to the difficulty in disentangling continuum
and emission line components. The spectrum extracted during the flare shows a
significant increase in the strengths of many of the lines and the appearance
of several previously undetected lines. In addition, some of the lines seen
before and after the flare are not present during the flare. On day 727 only

their probability distribution functions. A central result of the theoretical
analysis is the derivation of an expression for the crossover exponent $\phi$,

relates the precise value of $\phi$ to the exponent $\alpha$, describing
polymer loop statistics. We demonstrate that $1-\gamma_{11} < \alpha < 1 +
\nu$, depending on the possibility of a single loop to interact with
neighboring loops in the adsorbed polymer. The universal surface loop exponent
$\gamma_{11} \approx -0.39$ and the Flory exponent $\nu \approx 0.59$.
  We present the adsorption-desorption phase diagram of a polymer chain under
pulling and demonstrate that the relevant phase transformation becomes first
order whereas in the absence of external force it is known to be a continuous
one. The nature of this transformation turns to be dichotomic, i.e.,
coexistence of different phase states is not possible. These novel theoretical
predictions are verified by means of extensive Monte Carlo simulations.

choice of a droplet taking either route through the loop is influenced by the
presence of previous droplets which modulate the hydrodynamic resistance of the

a droplet from easily observable time series, namely from the choices the
droplets make at junctions and from the inter-droplet distances. This becomes
possible when utilizing a recently proposed theoretical model, based on a
number of simplifying assumptions. We here present several sets of measurements
of the hydrodynamic resistance of droplets, expressed in terms of a ""resistance

parameters, such as the viscosity, the volume of droplets, their velocity as
well as the spacing between them. At the same time (2), by using a standard
measurement technique, we compare the limitations of the proposed methods. As
an important result of this comparison we obtain the range of validity of the
simplifying assumptions made in the theoretical model.

gas spanning ~14kpc east and west of center. We find no new features beyond the
region previously mapped, and show that all six spatially-resolved features on
both the eastern and western sides (three on each side) comprise radially
aligned filaments. Such radial filaments can be most naturally explained by a
model in which gas deposited ""upstream"" in localized regions experiencing an
X-ray cooling flow subsequently free falls along the gravitational potential of
PerA, as we previously showed can explain the observed kinematics of the two
longest filaments. All the detected filaments coincide with locally bright
Halpha features, and have a ratio in CO(2-1) to Halpha luminosity of ~1e-3; we
show that these filaments have lower star formation efficiencies than the
nearly constant value found for molecular gas in nearby normal spiral galaxies.
On the other hand, some at least equally luminous Halpha features, including a
previously identified giant HII region, show no detectable cool molecular gas
with a corresponding ratio at least a factor of ~5 lower; in the giant HII
region, essentially all the pre-existing molecular gas may have been converted
to stars. We demonstrate that all the cool molecular filaments are
gravitationally bound, and without any means of support beyond thermal pressure
should collapse on timescales ~< 1e6yrs. By comparison, as we showed previously
the two longest filaments have much longer dynamical ages of ~1e7yrs. Tidal
shear may help delay their collapse, but more likely turbulent velocities of at
least a few tens km/s or magnetic fields with strengths of at least several
~10uG are required to support these filaments.

vector spaces over $\GF(p)$, $p$ a prime, by factorising $\vG$ over appropriate
normal subgroups. Then, by expressing $\GF(p)$ in terms of the commutator
subgroup of $\vG$, we construct alternating bilinear forms, which reflect
whether or not two elements of $\vG$ commute. Restricting to $p=2$, we search
for ``refinements'' in terms of quadratic forms, which capture the fact whether
or not the order of an element of $\vG$ is $\leq 2$. Such
factor-group-generated vector spaces admit a natural reinterpretation in the
language of symplectic and orthogonal polar spaces, where each point becomes a
``condensation'' of several distinct elements of $\vG$. Finally, several
well-known physical examples (single- and two-qubit Pauli groups, both the real
and complex case) are worked out in detail to illustrate the fine traits of the
formalism.

safety net that prevents inconsistent decisions via the Dutch Book Argument.
This result can be extended to situations where the payoff function is a more

feature rarely addressed in the formation of the electrostatic complexes,
namely the role of the mixing concentration on the microstructure. At low
mixing concentration, electrostatic complexes made from cationic-neutral
copolymers and alkyl sulfate surfactants exhibit spherical core-shell
microstructures. With increasing concentration, the complexes undergo a
sphere-to-cylinder transition, yielding elongated aggregates with diameter 50
nm and length up to several hundreds of nanometers. From the comparison between
homo- and diblock polymer phase behaviors, it is suggested that the
unidimensional growth is driven by the ability of the surfactant to
self-assemble into cylindrical micelles, and in particular when these
surfactants are complexed with oppositely charged polymers.

play a significant role in the semilattice decomposition theory of semigroups.
Right groups can be characterized as associative right quasigroups (magmas in

get right quasigroups which are not necessarily representable as direct
products of right zero semigroups and quasigroups. To obtain such a

  We find a system of identities which axiomatizes right product quasigroups,
and use this to find axiom systems for right product (left, right) loops; in
fact, we can obtain each of the latter by adjoining just one appropriate axiom
to the right product quasigroup axiom system.

propose a simple analytical description of vibrations of nonlinear oscillators.
We show that two dynamical transitions occur in the system. First of them
corresponds to the bifurcation of anti-phase vibrations of oscillators. And the
second one is caused by coincidence of LPT with separatrix dividing two stable
stationary states and leads to qualitative change in both phase and temporal
behavior of the LPT. Next problem under consideration relates to intensive
intermodal exchange in the periodic nonlinear systems with finite (n>2) number
of degrees of freedom. We consider two limiting cases. If the number of
particles is not large enough, the energy exchange between nonlinear normal
modes in two-dimensional integral manifolds is considered. When the number of
the particles increases the energy exchange between neighbor integral manifolds
becomes important that leads to formation of the localized excitations

substantial role. We have made our maps of the SZ effect available online.

Bazot et al. (2005), with various chemical compositions ([Fe/H] and Y), with or
without overshooting at the edge of the core. We computed their adiabatic
oscillation frequencies and compared them to the seismic observations. For each
set of chemical parameters, we kept the model which represented the best fit to
the echelle diagram. Then, by comparing the effective temperatures, gravities

able to derive precise parameters for this star. First we find that all the
models which correctly fit the echelle diagram have the same mass and radius,
with an uncertainty of the order of one percent. Second, the final comparison

299 of which (76%) have an optical or near-infrared (NIR) counterpart
identified from deep FLAMINGOS images. From X-ray and mass sensitivity limits,
we infer a total population of about 1700 young stars in the survey region.
Based on smoothed stellar surface density maps, we investigate the spatial
distribution of the X-ray sources and define three distinctive structures and
substructures within them. Structures B and C are associated with previously
known embedded IR clusters, while structure A is a new X-ray-identified
unobscured cluster. A high mass protostar RMCX #89 = IRAS 06306+0437 and its

subregions and are generally 20% of the total stellar population inferred from

formation around the HII region is present in the RMC, but do not support a
simple sequential triggering process through the cloud interior. While a
significant fraction of young stars are located in a distributed population

compared with the peak obtained with the tree gauge boson propagator. The peak
becomes much broader as the value of the gauge coupling increases. This
broadening is caused by multiple scatterings of fermions and gauge bosons
included through the non-perturbative resummation done by the SDE. In
particular, the Landau damping of gauge boson propagator plays an important
role in the broadening. Our results show no clear peak in the strong coupling

reversible branch depends both on A and T. By comparing the densities on the
reversible branches obtained for a range of values of T, we find that we can
collapse all data when plotted as function of A/T, which scales similar to both
the liftoff velocity and the time of flight of the packing. We further show
that switching between states obtained for different A and T, but chosen such
that their densities on the reversible branches match, does not lead to
appreciable hysteresis. We conclude that the appropriate control parameter for

propose a method to deal with such oscillation modes of solitons in potential
wells. We show that oscillations of a soliton is described by the Klein-Gordon
equation with an external potential. Although this analysis does not seems to
give quantitative scattering amplitude of a soliton itself, it explains
qualitative pictures of scattering. As a result of our analysis, when a soliton
is scattered in a cyclic potential, the Laue pattern emerges. Furthermore,
since our analysis is based on the Klein-Gordon equation, a discrete frequency
spectrum of a soliton is obtained when it is bounded by some potentials. What
is especially important is that this analysis predicts a frequency spectrum of
a soliton in the Coulomb potential and then we find that this system absorbs
external waves with specific frequencies described by the Rydberg formula.

screened potential on the spectrum of higher charmonium. We calculate the
masses, electromagnetic decays, and E1 transitions of charmonium states in the
screened potential model, and propose possible assignments for the newly
discovered charmonium or charmonium-like $""X,Y,Z""$ states. We find the masses
of higher charmonia with screened potential are considerably lower than those
with unscreened potential. The $\chi_{c2}(2P)$ mass agrees well with that of
the Z(3930), and the mass of $\psi(4415)$ is compatible with $\psi(5S)$ rather
than $\psi(4S)$. In particular, the discovered four $Y$ states in the ISR
process, i.e., $Y(4008), Y(4260), Y(4320/4360), Y(4660)$ may be assigned as the
$\psi(3S), \psi(4S), \psi(3D), \psi(6S)$ states respectively. The X(3940) and
X(4160) found in the double charmonium production in $e^+e^-$ annihilation may
be assigned as the $\eta_c(3S)$ and $\chi_{c0}(3P)$ states. Based on the
calculated E1 transition widths for $\chi_{c1}(2P)\to \gamma J/\psi$ and
$\chi_{c1}(2P)\to \gamma \psi(2S)$ and other results, we argue that the X(3872)
may be a $\chi_{c1}(2P)$ dominated charmonium state with some admixture of the
$D^0\bar{D}^{*0}$ component. Possible problems encountered in these assignments
and comparisons with other interpretations for these $X,Y,Z$ states are
discussed in detail. We emphasize that more theoretical and experimental
investigations are urgently needed to clarify these assignments and other
interpretations.

emulsions of two immiscible liquids at arbitrary volume fractions and low shear
rates. The model is based on a recursive-differential method formulated in
terms of the appropriate scaling variable which emerges from an analysis of
excluded volume effects in the system. This variable, called the effective
filling fraction, incorporates the geometrical information of the system which
determines the maximum packing and reduces to the bare filling fraction for
infinitely diluted emulsions. The agreement of our model for the viscosity with
experiments is remarkable for all the range of volume fractions and viscosity
ratio.

  Physical Review D",,"10.1103/PhysRevD.79.084040",,"gr-qc hep-th math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We analyze the quantum description of a free scalar field on the circle in
the presence of an explicitly time dependent potential, also interpretable as a
time dependent mass. Classically, the field satisfies a linear wave equation of
the form $\ddot{\xi}-\xi""+f(t)\xi=0$. We prove that the representation of the
canonical commutation relations corresponding to the particular case of a
massless free field ($f=0$) provides a unitary implementation of the dynamics
for sufficiently general mass terms, $f(t)$. Furthermore, this representation
is uniquely specified, among the class of representations determined by
$S^1$-invariant complex structures, as the only one allowing a unitary
dynamics. These conclusions can be extended in fact to fields on the two-sphere
possessing axial symmetry. This generalizes a uniqueness result previously
obtained in the context of the quantum field description of the Gowdy
cosmologies, in the case of linear polarization and for any of the possible
topologies of the spatial sections.
