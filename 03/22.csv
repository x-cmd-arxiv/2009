properties of polynomials and analytic results (primarily the covering
structure and distortion estimates), we analyze a path-lifting method for
finding approximate zeros, similar to those studied by Smale, Shub, Kim, and
others. Given any polynomial, this simple algorithm always converges to a root,
except on a finite set of initial points lying on a circle of a given radius.
  Specifically, the algorithm we analyze consists of iterating $$z -
\frac{f(z)-t_kf(z_0)}{f'(z)}$$ where the $t_k$ form a decreasing sequence of
real numbers and $z_0$ is chosen on a circle containing all the roots. We show
that the number of iterates required to locate an approximate zero of a
polynomial $f$ depends only on $\log|f(z_0)/\rho_\zeta|$ (where $\rho_\zeta$ is
the radius of convergence of the branch of $f^{-1}$ taking $0$ to a root
$\zeta$) and the logarithm of the angle between $f(z_0)$ and certain critical
values. Previous complexity results for related algorithms depend linearly on
the reciprocals of these angles. Note that the complexity of the algorithm does
not depend directly on the degree of $f$, but only on the geometry of the
critical values.
  Furthermore, for any polynomial $f$ with distinct roots, the average number
of steps required over all starting points taken on a circle containing all the
roots is bounded by a constant times the average of $\log(1/\rho_\zeta)$. The
average of $\log(1/\rho_\zeta)$ over all polynomials $f$ with $d$ roots in the
unit disk is ${\mathcal{O}}({d})$. This algorithm readily generalizes to
finding all roots of a polynomial (without deflation); doing so increases the
complexity by a factor of at most $d$.

LSO is already well understood for the case where a test-particle is in an
elliptical orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole (SBH) and for the case of a
circular orbit about a Kerr black hole (KBH) of normalised spin, S (|J|/M^2,
where J is the spin angular momentum of the KBH); it is worthwhile to extend
our knowledge to include elliptical orbits about a KBH. This extension helps to
lay the foundation for a better understanding of gravitational wave (GW)
emission. The mathematical developments described in this work sprang from the
use of an effective potential (V) derived from the Kerr metric, which
encapsulates the Lense-Thirring precession. That allowed us to develop a new
form of analytical expression to calculate the LSO Radius for circular orbits
(R_LSO) of arbitrary KBH spin. We were then able to construct a numerical
method to calculate the latus rectum (l_LSO) for an elliptical LSO.
  Abstract Formulae for E^2 (square of normalised orbital energy) and L^2
(square of normalised orbital angular momentum) in terms of eccentricity, e,
and latus rectum, l, were previously developed by others for elliptical orbits
around an SBH and then extended to the KBH case; we used these results to
generalise our analytical l_LSO equations to elliptical orbits. LSO data
calculated from our analytical equations and numerical procedures, and those
previously published, are then compared and found to be in excellent agreement.

photometric angles, and the measured I/F spectrum, and then outputs a
Lambertian albedo spectrum. The Lambertian albedo spectrum is valuable
geologically since it allows the mineralogical composition to be estimated.

solar irradiance at Mars divided by $\pi$. After discussing the capabilities

blue-sequence E/S0s with stellar masses >10^8 Msun, arguing that individual
objects may be evolving either up toward the red sequence or down into the blue
sequence. Blue-sequence E/S0 galaxies become more common with decreasing
stellar mass, comprising <2% of E/S0s near the ""shutdown mass"" M_s ~ 1-2 x

and sharply rising to >20-30% below the ""threshold mass"" M_t ~ 4-6 x 10^9 Msun.
The strong emergence of blue-sequence E/S0s below M_t coincides with a
previously reported global increase in mean atomic gas fractions below M_t for
galaxies of all types on both sequences, suggesting that the availability of
cold gas may be basic to blue-sequence E/S0s' existence. Environmental analysis
reveals that many sub-M_b blue-sequence E/S0s reside in low to intermediate
density environments. In mass-radius and mass-sigma scaling relations,
blue-sequence E/S0s are more similar to red-sequence E/S0s than to late-type
galaxies, but they represent a transitional class. While some of them,
especially in the high-mass range from M_b to M_s, resemble major-merger
remnants that will likely fade onto the red sequence, most blue-sequence E/S0s
below M_b show signs of disk and/or pseudobulge building, which may be enhanced
by companion interactions. We argue that sub-M_b blue-sequence E/S0s occupy a
""sweet spot"" in stellar mass and concentration, with both abundant gas and

using 3698 (M*>=1e9 Msun) galaxies with GEMS HST, COMBO-17, and Spitzer data.
Our results are: (1) Among 790 high mass (M*>=2.5e10 Msun) galaxies, the
visually-based merger fraction over z~0.24--0.80, ranges from 9%+-5% to 8%+-2%.
Lower limits on the major and minor merger fractions over this interval range
from 1.1% to 3.5%, and 3.6% to 7.5%, respectively. This is the first
approximate empirical estimate of the frequency of minor mergers at z<1. For a
visibility timescale of ~0.5 Gyr, it follows that over T_b~3--7 Gyr, ~68% of
high mass systems have undergone a merger of mass ratio >1/10, with ~16%, 45%,
and 7% of these corresponding respectively to major, minor, and ambiguous
`major or minor' mergers. The mean merger rate is a few x 1e-4 Gyr-1 Mpc-3. (2)
We compare the empirical merger fraction and rate for high mass galaxies to a
suite of Lambda CDM-based models: halo occupation distribution models,
semi-analytic models, and hydrodynamic SPH simulations. We find qualitative
agreement between observations and models such that the (major+minor) merger
fraction or rate from different models bracket the observations, and show a
factor of five dispersion. Near-future improvements can now start to rule out
certain merger scenarios. (3) Among ~3698 M*>=1e9 Msun galaxies, we find that
the mean SFR of visibly merging systems is only modestly enhanced compared to
non-interacting galaxies over z~0.24--0.80. Visibly merging systems only
account for less than 30% of the cosmic SFR density over T_b~3--7 Gyr. This
suggests that the behavior of the cosmic SFR density over the last 7 Gyr is
predominantly shaped by non-interacting galaxies.

fixed curve in the limit epsilon to 0, containing contributions from the length
of the curve (at order epsilon^3), the ends (epsilon^4), and the curvature
(epsilon^5).
  The second result is a Gamma-convergence result, in which the central curve
may vary along the sequence epsilon to 0. We prove that a rescaled version of
the H^{-1}-norm, which focuses on the epsilon^5 curvature term, Gamma-converges
to the L^2-norm of curvature. In addition, sequences along which the rescaled
norm is bounded are compact in the W^{1,2} -topology.

of appropriate trial functions in the variational characterisation of the

IRC+10420. We attempt to derive in self-consistent manner the physical
conditions inside the envelope by modelling the dust properties, and the
heating and cooling of molecular gas. We estimate a mass loss rate of $\sim$9

W/cm2 may penetrate deeply into the plasma as a result of efficient
ponderomotive acceleration of ions in the forward direction. The penetration
depth as big as hundreds of microns depends on the laser fluence, which has to

cosmological inflation for producing a scale-invariant spectrum of primordial
adiabatic fluctuations on large scales, is a break in the power spectrum at a
characteristic scale, below which the spectral index changes from n = 1 to n =
3. We study the constraints which current cosmological data place on the
location of such a break, and more generally on the position of the break and
the slope at length scales smaller than the break. The observational data we
use include the WMAP five-year data set (WMAP5), other CMB data from BOOMERanG,
CBI, VSA, and ACBAR, large-scale structure data from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS, their luminous red galaxies sample), Type Ia Supernovae data (the
""Union"" compilation), and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Lyman-\alpha forest
power spectrum (Ly\alpha) data. We employ the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method
to constrain the features in the primordial power spectrum which are motivated
by the matter bounce model. We give an upper limit on the length scale where
the break in the spectrum occurs.

classic results for neutral atoms with heavy nuclei having a mass number
$A\approx 10^2--10^6$ and extrapolating these results to massive nuclear
density cores with $A\approx(m_{\rm Planck}/m_n)^3 \sim 10^{57}$. The treatment
consists of solving the relativistic Thomas-Fermi equation describing a system
of $N_n$ neutrons, $N_p$ protons and $N_e$ electrons in beta decay equilibrium.
The $N_p$ protons are distributed at a constant density within a spherical core
of radius $R_c$. A new island of stability is found for $A > A_R =
0.039(N_p/A)^{1/2}(m_{Planck}/m_n)^3$. The Coulomb repulsion, screened by
relativistic electrons, is balanced by the gravitational self-interaction of
the core. In analogy to heavy nuclei they present, near their surface, an
overcritical electric field. The relation between $A$ and $N_p$ is generalized
to an arbitrary value of the mass number, and the phenomenological relations
for $A < 1.5\cdot 10^2$ are obtained as a limiting case.

correlations in a strongly correlated metal. Using LDA+DMFT, we show that both
these features can be quantitatively undertstood in the doped Fe-pnictides. We
