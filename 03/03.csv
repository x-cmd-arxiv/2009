close to M_Z which causes a tension between the LEP II Higgs mass bound 114 GeV
and the natural electroweak symmetry breaking in the MSSM. The usual way to
increase the light CP even Higgs mass was to increase the quartic coupling of
the up type Higgs. We point out that the light Higgs mass can be increased by
reducing the off-diagonal term in the mass matrix when tan beta is moderate,
which is about 5 to 10. As a result no mixing and/or a Higgs mixing angle of
the opposite sign arises and the branching ratio of Higgs decay is drastically
changed. This is possible in scalar sequestering scenario in which mu parameter
can be large independently of the electroweak symmetry breaking. We also
discuss the same effect in the BMSSM.

increasing the efficiency of the network; on the other hand, a non-operational

of all graphs with edge density p, the random graph G(n,p) contains the
smallest density of copies of K_{t,t}, the complete bipartite graph of size 2t.
Since K_{t,t} is a t-blowup of an edge, the following intriguing open question
arises: Is it true that of all graphs with triangle density p^3, the random
graph G(n,p) contains the smallest density of K_{t,t,t}, which is the t-blowup
of a triangle?
  Our main result gives an indication that the answer to the above question is
positive by showing that for some blowup, the answer must be positive. More
formally we prove that if G has triangle density p^3, then there is some 2 <= t
<= T(p) for which the density of K_{t,t,t} in G is at least p^{(3+o(1))t^2},
which (up to the o(1) term) equals the density of K_{t,t,t} in G(n,p). We also
consider the analogous question on skewed blowups, showing that somewhat
surprisingly, the behavior there is different. We also raise several
conjectures related to these problems and discuss some applications to other
areas.

work has employed sophisticated models that allow for the sharing of
information across genes. However, many recent gene expression studies have an
experimental design with several conditions that requires an even more involved

model to address the situation where there are many hypotheses that must be
simultaneously tested for each gene. In addition to having many hypotheses
within each gene, our analysis also addresses the more typical multiple

the bandwidth. At temperatures below 50 K, an energy gap develops in the
Cl-rich samples and grows to approximately 1000 cm-1 for T -> 0. With
increasing Br concentration spectral weight shifts into the gap region and
eventually fills it up completely. As the samples with x = 0.73, 0.85 and 0.9
become metallic at low temperatures, a Drude-like response develops due to the
coherent quasiparticles. Here, the quasiparticle scattering rate shows a
omega^2 dependence and the effective mass of the carriers is enhanced in

  If for an integer d, H_d denotes the subspace of the von

generators (but not their inverses), then we provide in this paper an explicit
upper bound on the norm on M_n(H_d), which improves and generalizes previous
results by Kemp-Speicher (in the scalar case) and Buchholz and Parcet-Pisier
(in the non-holomorphic setting). Namely the norm of an element of the form
$\sum_{i=(i_1,..., i_d)} a_i \otimes \lambda(g_{i_1} ... g_{i_d})$ is less than
$4^5 \sqrt e (\|M_0\|^2+...+\|M_d\|^2)^{1/2}$, where M_0,...,M_d are d+1
different block-matrices naturally constructed from the family (a_i)_{i \in

also proved that the same inequality holds for the norms in the associated
non-commutative L_p spaces when p is an even integer, p>d and when the
generators of the free group are more generally replaced by *-free R-diagonal
operators. In particular it applies to the case of free circular operators. We
also get inequalities for the non-holomorphic case, with a rate of growth of
order d+1 as for the classical Haagerup inequality. The proof is of
combinatorial nature and is based on the definition and study of a

been recently advocated, we construct a class of bottom-up holographic models

Within the proposed approach, the spectrum of masses square has the following
properties: It is linear, $m_n^2\sim n$, at not very large n, nonlinear at
larger n, with the nonlinear corrections being subleading in 1/N_c, has a
limiting mass, and the number of states is proportional to N_c. The considered
holographic models reflect thereby the merging of resonances into continuum and
the breaking of gluon string at sufficiently large quark-antiquark separation

their monomers. Excluded volume effects due to molecular crowding would lead to
correlations between molecules even without specific interactions. What is the
interplay of these effects in the crowded cellular environment? We study
dimerization of a model homodimer both when the mondimers are free or tethered
to each other. We consider a structured environment: Two monomers first diffuse
into a cavity of size $L$ and then fold and bind within the cavity. The folding
and binding are simulated using molecular dynamics based on a simplified
topology based model. The {\it confinement} in the cell is described by an
effective molecular concentration $C \sim L^{-3}$. A two-state coupled folding
and binding behavior is found. We show the maximal rate of dimerization
occurred at an effective molecular concentration $C^{op}\simeq 1m$M which is a
relevant cellular concentration. In contrast, for tethered chains the rate
keeps at a plateau when $C<C^{op}$ but then decreases sharply when $C>C^{op}$.
For both the free and tethered cases, the simulated variation of the rate of
dimerization and thermodynamic stability with effective molecular concentration
agrees well with experimental observations. In addition, a theoretical argument
for the effects of confinement on dimerization is also made.

structures is which properties P are such that any object that satisfies P
""behaves"" like a truly random one. In the context of graphs, Chung, Graham, and
Wilson call a graph p-quasi-random} if it satisfies a long list of the
properties that hold in G(n,p) with high probability, like edge distribution,
spectral gap, cut size, and more.
  Our main result here is that the following holds for any fixed graph H: if
the distribution of induced copies of H in a graph G is close (in a well
defined way) to the distribution we would expect to have in G(n,p), then G is
either p-quasi-random or p'-quasi-random, where p' is the unique non-trivial
solution of a certain polynomial equation. We thus infer that having the
correct distribution of induced copies of any single graph H is enough to
guarantee that a graph has the properties of a random one. The proof techniques
we develop here, which combine probabilistic, algebraic and combinatorial
tools, may be of independent interest to the study of quasi-random structures.

believed to evolve in binary systems and to have either a more massive WD or a

binaries, the precursors of millisecond pulsars (MSPs), produce significant
numbers of LMWDs (e.g., Benvenuto & De Vito 2005), suggesting that the SDSS
LMWDs may have neutron star companions. No convincing pulsar signal is detected
in our data. This is consistent with the findings of van Leeuwen et al. (2007),
who conducted a GBT search for radio pulsations at 340 MHz from unseen
companions to eight SDSS WDs (five are still considered LMWDs; the three others

correlation similar to the well-studied relationship between radio halo and
X-ray luminosities of the host cluster, but also find that large scale radio
galaxy detections follow a similar trend to that for radio halos. With this
quantitative study, we thus confirm the upper envelope to the radio
luminosities for X-ray selected clusters, and the higher detection rates for
diffuse radio emission (including halos, relics and radio galaxies) at X-ray
luminosities above approximately 10**45 erg/s. We can neither confirm nor
refute the claims for a tight correlation between these radio halo and X-ray
luminosities, i.e. whether the halo luminosity function of X-ray clusters is
bimodal (having high/on and low/off states), or whether the radio luminosity
can take on a wide range of values up to a maximum at each cluster X-ray
luminosity. The resolution of this issue may provide a unique diagnostic for
the timescales over which relativistic particles can be accelerated following
cluster mergers. We discuss several important selection effects on radio vs.
X-ray luminosity correlations, including surface brightness thresholds and
non-X-ray-selected diffuse radio sources. We also report several new detections

rate. The DM energy input is estimated by inserting the energy released by DM
annihilations (as predicted by an adiabatic contraction of the original DM
profile) in a spherically symmetric radiative transfer scheme. In addition to
the heating effects of the energy absorbed, we include its feedback upon the
chemical properties of the gas, which is critical to determine the cooling rate
in the halo, and hence the fragmentation scale and Jeans mass of the first
stars. We find that DM annihilation does alter the free electron and especially
the H2 fraction when the gas density is n>~ 10^4 cm^-3, for our fiducial
parameter values. However, even if the change in the H2 abundance and the
cooling efficiency of the gas is large (sometimes exceeding a factor 100), the
effects on the temperature of the collapsing gas are far smaller (a reduction
by a factor <~1.5), since the gas cooling rate depends very strongly on
temperature: then, the fragmentation mass scale is reduced only slightly,
hinting towards no dramatic change in the initial mass function of the first
stars.

a solid mathematical framework to deal with many application domains of
interest ranging from biology, chemical, electrical, and mechanical
engineering, to economics. However, the inherent complexity of such systems
poses serious difficulties to control design, when control objectives depart
from the standard ones investigated in the current literature, e.g.
stabilization, regulation, and etc. In this paper we propose one approach to
control design, which is based on the construction of symbolic models, where
each symbolic state and each symbolic label correspond to an aggregate of
continuous states and to an aggregate of input signals in the original system.
The use of symbolic models offers a systematic methodology for control design
in which constraints coming from software and hardware, interacting with the
physical world, can be integrated. The main contribution of this paper is in
showing that incrementally input-to-state stable time-delay systems do admit
symbolic models that are approximately bisimilar to the original system, with a
precision that can be rendered as small as desired. An algorithm is also
presented which computes the proposed symbolic models. When the state and input
spaces of time-delay systems are bounded, which is the case in many realistic
situations, the proposed algorithm is shown to terminate in a finite number of
steps.

goal of the present paper is two-fold. First, we provide an introduction to
CLE, a mathematical theory for random loops in simply connected domains with
properties of conformal invariance, developed recently by Sheffield and Werner.
It is expected to be related to CFT models with central charges between 0 and 1
(including all minimal models). Second, we further develop the theory by
deriving results that will be crucial for the construction of the stress-energy

which we prove basic but important theorems. We then propose natural
definitions of CLE probability functions on the Riemann sphere and on doubly
connected domains. Under some natural assumptions, we prove conformal
invariance and other non-trivial theorems related to these constructions. We
only use the defining properties of CLE as well as some basic results about the
CLE measure. Although this paper is guided by the construction of the
stress-energy tensor, we believe that the theorems proved and techniques used

lower-mass pre-main sequence stars accompany the massive stars, and the
expanding HII regions paradoxically trigger new star formation as they destroy
their natal clouds. While this schematic picture is established, our
understanding of the complex astrophysical processes involved in clustered star

Grassmann parameters. We demonstrate that a significant fraction of diagrams in
the expansion vanishes for a judicious choice of these Grassmann parameters,
which simplifies the computation of amplitudes. Even pure-gluon amplitudes
require fewer diagrams than in the ordinary MHV vertex expansion.
  We show that the super MHV vertex expansion arises from the recursion
relation associated with a holomorphic all-line supershift. This is a
supersymmetric generalization of the holomorphic all-line shift recently
introduced in arXiv:0811.3624. We study the large-z behavior of generating
functions under these all-line supershifts, and find that they generically
provide 1/z^k falloff at (Next-to)^k MHV level. In the case of anti-MHV
generating functions, we find that a careful choice of shift parameters
guarantees a stronger 1/z^(k+4) falloff. These particular all-line supershifts
may therefore play an important role in extending the super MHV vertex
expansion to N=8 supergravity.

perform an optimisation procedure that leads the code to achieve sufficient

several exciting directions in the coming decade. First, it will be possible to
obtain precision measurements of the Galaxy's central potential, providing both
a unique test of General Relativity (GR) and a detection of the extended dark
matter distribution that is predicted to exist around the SMBH. Tests of
gravity have not previously been possible on the mass scale of a SMBH.
Similarly, only upper limits on the extended matter distribution on small
scales currently exist; detection of dark matter on these scales is an
important test of Lambda-CDM and the detection of stellar remnants would reveal
a population that may dominate the stellar dynamics on the smallest scales.
Second, our detailed view of the SMBH and its local gas and stellar environment
provides insight into how SMBHs at the centers of galaxies form, grow and
interact with their environs as well as on the exotic processes at work in the
densest stellar clusters in the Universe. The key questions, still unanswered,
of when and how SMBHs formed in the early universe, and the myriad ways in
which feedback from SMBHs can affect structure formation, can be informed by
directly observing the physical processes operating at the SMBH.

$\propto$ $\sigma^{8-10}$, depending on the AGN fuelling mechanism, where
$\sigma$ is the velocity dispersion of the hot gas. This result agrees well
with both observations and semi-analytic models. In more massive ellipticals
and clusters, AGN outflows quickly become buoyancy-dominated. This necessarily
means that heating by a central cluster AGN redistributes the intracluster
medium (ICM) such that the mass of hot gas, within the cooling radius, should
be $ \propto L_{\rm X}(<r_{\rm cool})/[g(r_{\rm cool})\sigma]$, where $g(r_{\rm
cool})$ is the gravitational acceleration at the cooling radius. This
prediction is confirmed using observations of seven clusters. The same
mechanism also defines a critical ICM cooling time of $\sim 0.5$ Gyr, which is
in reasonable agreement with recent observations showing that star formation
and AGN activity are triggered below a universal cooling time threshold.

amortized constant insertion time, worst case constant deletion time and lookup
time, and good memory utilization. However, with a noticeable probability
during the insertion of n elements some insertion requires \Omega(log n) time.
Whereas such an amortized guarantee may be suitable for some applications, in
other applications (such as high-performance routing) this is highly
undesirable.
  Recently, Kirsch and Mitzenmacher (Allerton '07) proposed a de-amortization
of cuckoo hashing using various queueing techniques that preserve its
attractive properties. Kirsch and Mitzenmacher demonstrated a significant
improvement to the worst case performance of cuckoo hashing via experimental
results, but they left open the problem of constructing a scheme with provable
properties.
  In this work we follow Kirsch and Mitzenmacher and present a de-amortization
of cuckoo hashing that provably guarantees constant worst case operations.
Specifically, for any sequence of polynomially many operations, with
overwhelming probability over the randomness of the initialization phase, each
operation is performed in constant time. Our theoretical analysis and
experimental results indicate that the scheme is highly efficient, and provides
a practical alternative to the only other known dynamic dictionary with such
worst case guarantees, due to Dietzfelbinger and Meyer auf der Heide (ICALP
'90).

into a two-phase ISM, star formation can initially be slightly enhanced and
then, on timescales of few million years, rapidly quenched, as a consequence
both of the high temperatures attained and of the reduction of cloud mass
(mainly due to Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities). We then introduce a model of
(prevalently) {\em negative} AGN feedback, where an exponentially declining
star formation is quenched, on a very short time scale, at a time t_AGN, due to
AGN feedback. Using the Bruzual & Charlot (2003) population synthesis model and
our star formation history, we predict galaxy colours from this model and match
them to a sample of nearby early-type galaxies showing signs of recent episodes
of star formation (Kaviraj et al. 2007). We find that the quantity t_gal -
t_AGN, where t_gal is the galaxy age, is an excellent indicator of the presence
of feedback processes, and peaks significantly around t_gal - t_AGN \approx
0.85 Gyr for our sample, consistent with feedback from recent energy injection
by AGNs in relatively bright (M_{B} \lsim -19) and massive nearby early-type

enhancement of 3 magnitudes in NUV(GALEX)-g, with respect to the unperturbed,

proton-air cross section at energies beyond the reach of fixed target and

fluctuations are a measure of the proton-air particle production cross section.
Since the first interaction point in air cannot be measured directly, various
methods have been developed in the past to estimate the depth of the first
interaction from air shower observables in combination with simulations. As the
simulations depend on assumptions made for hadronic particle production at
energies and phase space regions not accessible in accelerator experiments, the
derived cross sections are subject to significant systematic uncertainties. The
focus of this work is the development of an improved analysis technique that
allows a significant reduction of the model dependence of the derived cross
section at very high energy. Performing a detailed Monte Carlo study of the
potential and the limitations of different measurement methods, we quantify the
dependence of the measured cross section on the used hadronic interaction
model. Based on these results, a general improvement to the analysis methods is
proposed by introducing the actually derived cross section already in the
simulation of reference showers. The reduction of the model dependence is
demonstrated for one of the measurement methods.

magnetism in p-(Cd,Mn)Te quantum wells we have carried out magneto-optical
measurements and Monte Carlo simulations of time dependent magnetization. The
experimental results show that magnetization relaxation is faster than 20 ns in
the paramagnetic state. Decreasing temperature below the Curie temperature Tc
results in an increase of the relaxation time but to less than 10 micro
seconds. This fast relaxation may explain why the spontaneous spin splitting of
electronic states is not accompanied by the presence of non-zero macroscopic
magnetization below Tc. Our Monte Carlo results reproduce the relative change
of the relaxation time on decreasing temperature. At the same time, the
numerical calculations demonstrate that antiferromagnetic spin-spin
interactions, which compete with the hole-mediated long-range ferromagnetic
coupling, play an important role in magnetization relaxation of the system. We
find, in particular, that magnetization dynamics is largely accelerated by the
presence of antiferromagnetic couplings to the Mn spins located outside the
region, where the holes reside. This suggests that macroscopic spontaneous
magnetization should be observable if the thickness of the layer containing
localized spins will be smaller than the extension of the hole wave function.
Furthermore, we study how a spin-independent part of the Mn potential affects
Tc. Our findings show that the alloy disorder potential tends to reduce Tc, the
effect being particularly strong for the attractive potential that leads to
hole localization.

C120H36) have been computed using Density Functional Theory (DFT). Trends in
the dominant band positions and intensities are compared to those of large,
compact PAHs as a function of geometry, size and charge. Irregular edge
moieties that are common in terrestrial PAHs, such as bay regions and rings
with quartet hydrogens, are shown to be uncommon in astronomical PAHs. As for
all PAHs comprised solely of C and H reported to date, mid-IR emission from
irregular PAHs fails to produce a strong CCstr band at 6.2 um, the position
characteristic of the important, class A astronomical PAH spectra. Earlier
studies showed inclusion of nitrogen within a PAH shifts this to 6.2 um for PAH
cations. Here we show this band shifts to 6.3 um in nitrogenated PAH anions,
close to the position of the CC stretch in class B astronomical PAH spectra.
Thus nitrogenated PAHs may be important in all sources and the peak position of
the CC stretch near 6.2 um appears to directly reflect the PAH cation to anion
ratio. Large irregular PAHs exhibit features at 7.8 um but lack them near 8.6
um. Hence, the 7.7 um astronomical feature is produced by a mixture of small
and large PAHs while the 8.6 um band can only be produced by large compact
PAHs. As with the CCstr, the position and profile of these bands reflect the
PAH cation to anion ratio.

annihilation cross section has important implications for the detection of dark
matter annihilation in subhalos in the Galactic halo. In addition to the boost
to the dark matter annihilation cross section from the high densities of these
subhalos with respect to the main halo, an additional boost caused by the
Sommerfeld enhancement results from the fact that they are kinematically colder
than the Galactic halo. If we further believe the generic prediction of CDM
that in each subhalo there is an abundance of substructure which is
approximately self-similar to that of the Galactic halo, then I show that
additional boosts coming from the density enhancements of these small
substructures and their small velocity dispersions enhance the dark matter
annihilation cross section even further. I find that very large boost factors
($10^5$ to $10^9$) are obtained in a large class of models. The implications of
these boost factors for the detection of dark matter annihilation from dwarf
Spheroidal galaxies in the Galactic halo are such that, generically, they
outshine the background gamma-ray flux and are detectable by the Fermi
Gamma-ray Space Telescope.

unity, the Michie-King profiles are recovered. However, for q smaller than
unity there is a gradual modification in the shape of the density profiles
which depends on the degree of tidal damage imposed on the model, thereby also
providing a good fit for globular clusters. It is also shown that a subclass of
these models, those with a deeper potential and $q$ slightly less than unity,
present a distribution resembling the de Vaucoulers $r^{1/4}$ profile which
yields a good description of the structure of elliptical galaxies. This subset
of models follows this trend, with a slight departure over nearly 10 orders of

star has L_X/L_Bol and an X-ray spectrum similar to non-accreting Beta Pic

emission and excess FUV continuum seen in spectra of actively accreting Herbig
Ae stars, and from the FUV continuum, we find the accretion rate is < 1.4x10^-9

the gas in the outer disk is likely optically thin. Assuming a [CO]/[H2]

For CGF systems without feedback delay, we prove that the optimal solutions

finding is important for practical MIMO training design. For CCF systems, the

is verified through numerical analysis. Taking this fact into account, we
propose a simple yet near optimal transmission strategy for CCF systems, and

prediction on the magnetic dipole $B^*_c\to B_c+\gamma$ decay turns out to be
very sensitive to the mass difference between $B^*_c$ and $B_c$ mesons, the
decay width $\Gamma(B^*_c \to B_c \gamma)$ may help in determining the mass of
$B^*_c$ experimentally. Furthermore, we compare the results from the harmonic
oscillator potential and the linear potential and identify the decay processes

footing for the NLSV signal that reads out the magnetization, and for the

two non-magnetic leads via sequential tunneling. In one lead, the chemical
potentials for spin-up and -down electrons are split due to the spin injection
in the NLSV. This splitting (or the spin bias) is crucial to the NLSV signal

magnitude of the spin bias is estimated, and found large enough to drive the
magnetization switching of the cobalt nanograin reported in earlier
experiments. A microscopic interpretation of NLSV signal in the sequential
tunneling regime is thereby raised, which show properties due to the ultrasmall
size of the grain. The dynamics at the reversal point shows that there may be a
spin-polarized current instead of the anticipated pure spin current flowing
during the reversal due to the electron accumulation in the floating lead used
for the readout of NLSV signal.

impurities within a solid coating of the trap is discussed as a possible cause
of observed anomalously large losses of UCNs in solid material UCN traps. Then
significant losses of UCNs arise only if resonances occur in the UCN-impurity
scattering amplitude. For a large size impurity, higher partial waves in the
UCN-impurity interaction are important, and they are taken into account in the
present paper. The method of the calculation is applicable to irregular shape
impurities as well. A small distortion of an impurity shape, if it splits the
resonance, can increase the UCN losses by a few times. UCN losses in the
beryllium trap are calculated assuming they are due to the UCN capture by ice
spherical impurities within the coating of the trap walls. Both s- and p-wave
resonances contribute significantly to the UCN losses considered. As an
example, observed anomalous large UCN losses are achieved if the average radius
of the impurity is about 600 Angstroms and the impurity density is about
3*10^{14}/cm^3. A distortion of the spherical shape of the impurity could
increase the UCN losses and therefore decrease the impurity density.

in the context of contemporary multiple testing problems, where the number of

serious than in classical cases. This is particularly true when the null
distributions of test statistics are relatively light-tailed, for example, when
they can be based on Normal or Student's $t$ approximations. There, if the test
statistics can fairly be viewed as being generated by a linear process, an
analysis founded on the incorrect assumption of independence is asymptotically
correct as the number of hypotheses diverges. In particular, the point process
representing the null distribution of the indices at which statistically
significant test results occur is approximately Poisson, just as in the case of
independence. The Poisson process also has the same mean as in the independence
case, and of course exhibits no clustering of false discoveries. However, this
result can fail if the null distributions are particularly heavy-tailed. There
clusters of statistically significant results can occur, even when the null

we assume that magnetic fields inside the disk are turbulent and dominated by
the azimuthal component and that the azimuthally averaged Maxwell stress is
proportional to the total pressure. We prescribe the magnetic flux advection
rate to determine the azimuthal magnetic flux at a given radius.
  We find magnetically supported, thermally stable solutions for both optically
thin and thick disks, in which the heating enhanced by the strong magnetic
field balances the radiative cooling. The temperature in a low-$\beta$ disk is
lower than that in an ADAF/RIAF but higher than that in a standard disk. We
also study the radial dependence of the thermal equilibrium solutions.
  The optically thin, low-$\beta$ branch extends to $ \dot M \gtrsim 0.1 {\dot
M}_{\rm Edd}$, in which the temperature anti-correlates with the mass accretion
rate. Thus optically thin low-$\beta$ disks can explain the bright hard state.
Optically thick, low-$\beta$ disks have the radial dependence of the effective
temperature $T_{\rm eff} \propto \varpi^{-3/4}$. Such disks will be observed as
staying in a high/soft state. Furthermore, limit cycle oscillations between an
optically thick low-$\beta$ disk and a slim disk will occur because the
optically thick low-$\beta$ branch intersects with the radiation pressure
dominated standard disk branch. These limit cycle oscillations will show a
smaller luminosity variation than that between a standard disk and a slim disk.

variable $Y$ depends on $Y$ through an observed auxiliary categorical variable
$Z$ (i.e., the response probability of $Y$ is conditionally independent of $Y$
given $Z$), a simple method often used in practice is to use $Z$ categories as
imputation cells and construct estimators by imputing nonrespondents or
reweighting respondents within each imputation cell. This simple method,
however, is inefficient when some $Z$ categories have small sizes and ad hoc
methods are often applied to collapse small imputation cells. Assuming a
parametric model on the conditional probability of $Z$ given $Y$ and a
nonparametric model on the distribution of $Y$, we develop a pseudo empirical
likelihood method to provide more efficient survey estimators. Our method
avoids any ad hoc collapsing small $Z$ categories, since reweighting or
imputation is done across $Z$ categories. Asymptotic distributions for
estimators of population means based on the pseudo empirical likelihood method
are derived. For variance estimation, we consider a bootstrap procedure and its
consistency is established. Some simulation results are provided to assess the
finite sample performance of the proposed estimators.

Convergence is proved provided a strong Doeblin condition is satisfied, which
essentially requires that all the proposal functions have uniformly heavier
tails than the stationary distribution. The proof also holds if proposals
depending on the current state are used intermittently, provided the
information from these iterations is not used for adaption. The algorithm gives
samples from the exact distribution within a finite number of iterations with
probability arbitrarily close to 1. The algorithm is particularly useful when a
large number of samples from the same distribution is necessary, like in
Bayesian estimation, and in CPU intensive applications like, for example, in

dynamics, are usually assumed to be coarse-grained representations of an
underlying microscopic fluid. A fundamental question is whether there exists a
map from microscopic particles in these systems to the corresponding
coarse-grained particles, such that the coarse-grained system has the same bulk
and transport properties as the underlying system. In this letter, we
investigate the coarse-graining of microscopic fluids using a Voronoi type
projection that has been suggested in several studies. The simulations show
that the projection fails in defining coarse-grained particles that have a
physically meaningful connection to the microscopic fluid. In particular, the
Voronoi projection produces identical coarse-grained equilibrium properties
when applied to systems with different microscopic interactions and different
bulk properties.

of the loop-by-loop unfolding of the toroidal structure. Moreover, the
dynamics, how the internal structure of chain varies under tension, is
examined. At the first stage of the stretching, the toroidal condensate
decreases its size until the loss of the first loop in the toroid and then,
oscillates around this size for the rest of the unfolding process. The normal
vector of the toroid is pulled toward the pulling-force direction and swings
back to its early direction repeatedly when the toroidal chain looses a loop.
The results provide new and valuable information concerning the elasticity and

X-ray luminosity ($L_X$) using a new database of 72 nearby clusters from the
WIde-Field Nearby Galaxy-cluster Survey (WINGS) combined with literature data
at $z=0.5-1.2$. Most WINGS clusters have $\sigma$ between 500 and 1100 $\rm km
s^{-1}$, and $L_X$ between 0.2 and $5 \times 10^{44} \rm erg/s$. The S0
fraction in clusters is known to increase with time at the expense of the
spiral population. We find that the spiral and S0 fractions have evolved more
strongly in lower $\sigma$, less massive clusters, while we confirm that the
proportion of ellipticals has remained unchanged. Our results demonstrate that
morphological evolution since $z=1$ is not confined to massive clusters, but is
actually more pronounced in low mass clusters, and therefore must originate
either from secular (intrinsic) evolution and/or from environmental mechanisms
that act preferentially in low-mass environments, or both in low- and high-mass
systems. We also find that the evolution of the spiral fraction perfectly
mirrors the evolution of the fraction of star-forming galaxies. Interestingly,
at low-z the spiral fraction anticorrelates with $L_X$. Conversely, no
correlation is observed with $\sigma$. Given that both $\sigma$ and $L_X$ are
tracers of the cluster mass, these results pose a challenge for current
scenarios of morphological evolution in clusters.

massive black hole sitting at a galactic centre is a problem of major relevance
for the future space-based gravitational-wave observatory LISA (Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna), as the signals from these systems will be buried
in the data stream and accurate gravitational-wave templates will be needed to
extract them. The main difficulty in describing these systems lies in the
estimation of the gravitational effects of the stellar-mass compact object on
his own trajectory around the massive black hole, which can be modeled as the
action of a local force, the self-force. In this paper, we present a new
time-domain numerical method for the computation of the self-force in a
simplified model consisting of a charged scalar particle orbiting a nonrotating
black hole. We use a multi-domain framework in such a way that the particle is
located at the interface between two domains so that the presence of the
particle and its physical effects appear only through appropriate boundary
conditions. In this way we eliminate completely the presence of a small length
scale associated with the need of resolving the particle. This technique also
avoids the problems associated with the impact of a low differentiability of
the solution in the accuracy of the numerical computations. The spatial
discretization of the field equations is done by using the pseudospectral
collocation method and the time evolution, based on the method of lines, uses a
Runge-Kutta solver. We show how this special framework can provide very
efficient and accurate computations in the time domain, which makes the
technique amenable for the intensive computations required in the
astrophysically-relevant scenarios for LISA.

as the frequency of the applied field and the bias (depolarization) of the

across Europe but the methods available to estimate its true impact upon
sub-national areas remain inconsistent, constrained by inadequate systems of

England, official statistics on immigration and emigration are derived from a
combination of survey and census sources. This paper demonstrates how
administrative data systems such as those which capture registrations of recent
migrants with a local doctor, National Insurance Number registrations by
workers from abroad and the registration of foreign students for higher
education, can provide data to better understand patterns and trends in
international migration. The paper proposes a model for the estimation of
immigration at a local level, integrating existing national estimates from the
Office for National Statistics with data from these administrative sources. The
model attempts to circumvent conceptual differences between datasets through
the use of proportional distributions rather than absolute migrant counts in
the estimation process. The model methodology and the results it produces
provide alternative estimates of immigration for consideration by the Office
for National Statistics as it develops its own programme of improvement to

supergravity. We find some differences with the general bosonic construction of
4-dimensional gauged supergravities.
  The global symmetry group of N=1,d=4 supergravity consists of three factors:
the scalar manifold isometry group, the invariance group of the complex vector
kinetic matrix and the U(1) R-symmetry group. In contrast to (half)-maximal
supergravities, the latter two symmetries are not embedded into the isometry
group of the scalar manifold. We identify some components of the embedding
tensor with Fayet-Iliopoulos terms and we find that supersymmetry implies that
the inclusion of R-symmetry as a factor of the global symmetry group requires a
non-trivial extension of the standard p-form hierarchy. This extension involves
additional 3- and 4-forms. One additional 3-form is dual to the superpotential
(seen as a deformation of the simplest theory).
  We study the closure of the supersymmetry algebra on all the bosonic p-form
fields of the hierarchy up to duality relations. In order to close the
supersymmetry algebra without the use of duality relations one must construct
the hierarchy in terms of supermultiplets. Such a construction requires
fermionic duality relations among the hierarchy's fermions and these turn out
to be local.

excitation of natural rubidium in a vapor cell have been obtained and described
with experimental accuracy by a detailed theoretical model based on the optical
Bloch equations. The D1 transition of rubidium is a challenging system to
analyze theoretically because it contains transitions that are only partially
resolved under Doppler broadening. The theoretical model took into account all
nearby transitions, the coherence properties of the exciting laser radiation,
and the mixing of magnetic sublevels in an external magnetic field and also
included averaging over the Doppler profile. Great care was taken to obtain
accurate experimental signals and avoid systematic errors. The experimental
signals were reproduced very well at each hyperfine transition and over a wide
range of laser power densities, beam diameters, and laser detunings from the
exact transition frequency. The bright resonance expected at the F_g=1 -->
F_e=2 transition of Rb-87 has been observed. A bright resonance was observed at
the F_g=2 --> F_e=3 transition of Rb-85, but displaced from the exact position
of the transition due to the influence of the nearby F_g=2 --> F_e=2
transition, which is a dark resonance whose contrast is almost two orders of
magnitude larger than the contrast of the bright resonance at the F_g=2 -->
F_e=3 transition. Even in this very delicate situation, the theoretical model
described in detail the experimental signals at different laser detunings.

$K_{u}$ is the anisotropy energy, and $H_{K}$ is the anisotropy field. Main
features of the experimental results reported in many SPM's can be well
explained in terms of the present model. The normalized FC susceptibility
increases monotonically increases as the normalized temperature $y$ decreases.
The normalized ZFC susceptibility exhibits a peak at the normalized blocking
temperature $y_{b}$ ($=k_{B}T_{b}/K_{u}< V>$), forming the $y_{b}$ vs $h$
diagram. For large $\sigma$ ($\sigma >0.4$), $y_{b}$ starts to increase with
increasing $h$, showing a peak at $h=h_{b}$, and decreases with further
increasing $h$. The maximum of $y_{b}$ at $h=h_{b}$ is due to the nonlinearity
of the Langevin function. For small $\sigma$, $y_{b}$ monotonically decreases
with increasing $h$. The derivative of the normalized FC magnetization with
respect to $h$ shows a peak at $h$ = 0 for small $y$. This is closely related

criteria. In his breakthrough paper [Bec91], Beck demonstrated that a
constructive variant can be given under certain more restrictive conditions.
Simplifications of his procedure and relaxations of its restrictions were
subsequently exhibited in several publications [Alo91, MR98, CS00, Mos06,
Sri08, Mos08]. In [Mos09], a constructive proof was presented that works under
negligible restrictions, formulated in terms of the Bounded Occurrence
Satisfiability problem. In the present paper, we reformulate and improve upon
these findings so as to directly apply to almost all known applications of the
general Local Lemma.

the evolution of galaxies over cosmic time. Many future observatories,
including JWST, ALMA, GMT, TMT and E-ELT will intensively observe starlight
over a broad redshift range, out to the dawn of the modern Universe when the
first galaxies formed. It has, however, become clear that the properties and
evolution of galaxies are intimately linked to the growth of their central
black holes. Understanding the formation of galaxies, and their subsequent
evolution, will therefore be incomplete without similarly intensive
observations of the accretion light from supermassive black holes (SMBH) in
galactic nuclei. To make further progress, we need to chart the formation of
typical SMBH at z>6, and their subsequent growth over cosmic time, which is
most effectively achieved with X-ray observations. Recent technological
developments in X-ray optics and instrumentation now bring this within our
grasp, enabling capabilities fully matched to those expected from flagship
observatories at longer wavelengths.

  Confidential Messages","Revised version submiitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, bounds to the rate-equivocation region for the general
3-receiver broadcast channel (BC) with degraded message sets, are presented for
confidential messages to be kept secret from one of the receivers. This model
is more general than the 2-receiver BCs with confidential messages with an
external wiretapper, and the recently studied 3-receiver degraded BCs with
confidential messages, since in the model studied in this paper, the conditions
on the receivers are general and the wiretapper receives the common message.
Wyner's code partitioning combined with double-binning is used to show the
achievable rate tuples. Error probability analysis and equivocation calculation
are also provided. The secure coding scheme is sufficient to provide security
for the 3-receiver BC with 2 or 3 degraded message sets, for the scenarios: (i)
3 degraded message sets, where the first confidential message is sent to
receivers 1 and 2 and the second confidential message is sent to receiver 1,
(ii) 2 degraded message sets, where one confidential message is sent to
receiver 1, and (iii) 2 degraded message sets, where one confidential message
is sent to receivers 1 and 2. The proof for the outer bound is shown for the
cases where receiver 1 is more capable than the wiretap receiver 3, for the
first two scenarios. Under the condition that both receivers 1 and 2 are less
noisy than the wiretap receiver 3, the inner and outer bounds coincide, giving
the rate-equivocation region for (iii). In addition, a new outer bound for the
general 3-receiver BC with 3 degraded messages is obtained.

formation in HII galaxies, with the aim of detecting episodes of recent star
formation in an early phase of evolution where the first supernovae start to
appear. The observed radio spectral energy distribution (SED) covers a
behaviour range; 1) there are galaxies where the SED is characterized by a
synchrotron-type slope, 2) galaxies with a thermal slope, and 3) galaxies with
possible free-free absorption at long wavelengths. The latter SED represents a
signature of massive star clusters that are still well inside the progenitor
molecular cloud. Based on the comparison of the star formation rates (SFR)
determined from the recombination lines and those determined from the radio
emission we find that SFR(Ha) is on average five times higher than SFR(1.4
GHz). These results suggest that the emission of these galaxies is dominated by
a recent and massive star formation event in which the first supernovae (SN)
just started to explode. We conclude that the systematic lack of synchrotron
emission in those systems with the largest equivalent width of Hb can only be
explained if those are young starbursts of less than 3.5Myr of age, i.e. before
the first type II SNe emerge.

experiments and via searches for dark matter (DM). We focus on three DM
possibilities in the SUSY context: the thermally produced neutralino, a mixture
of axion and axino, and the gravitino, and compare and contrast signals that
may be expected at colliders, in direct detection (DD) experiments searching of
DM relics left over from the Big Bang, and indirect detection (ID) experiments
designed to detect the products of DM annihilations within the solar interior
or galactic halo. Detection of DM particles using multiple strategies provides
complementary information that may shed light on the new physics associated
with the dark matter sector. In contrast to the mSUGRA model where the measured
cold DM relic density restricts us to special regions mostly on the edge of the
m_0-m_{1/2} plane, the entire parameter plane becomes allowed if the
universality assumption is relaxed in models with just one additional
parameter. Then, thermally produced neutralinos with a well-tempered mix of
wino, bino and higgsino components, or with a mass adjusted so that their
annihilation in the early universe is Higgs-resonance-enhanced, can be the DM.
Well-tempered neutralinos typically yield heightened rates for DD and ID
experiments compared to generic predictions from minimal supergravity. If
instead DM consists of axinos (possibly together with axions) or gravitinos,
then there exists the possibility of detection of quasi-stable next-to-lightest
SUSY particles at colliding beam experiments, with especially striking
consequences if the NLSP is charged, but no DD or ID detection. The exception
for mixed axion/axino DM is that DD of axions may be possible.
