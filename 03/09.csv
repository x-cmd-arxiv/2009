the new opportunities at the LHC. Next I review the generic, qualitative

analyze observables which characterize directly the medium produced in the
collisions - bulk observables or soft probes -: multiplicities, collective
flow, hadrochemistry at low transverse momentum, correlations and fluctuations.
Second, I move to calibrated probes of the medium i.e. typically those whose
expectation in the absence of any medium can be described in Quantum
Chromodynamics (QCD) using perturbative techniques (pQCD), usually called hard
probes. I discuss particle production at large transverse momentum and jets,
heavy-quark and quarkonium production, and photons and dileptons. Finally,
after a brief review of pA collisions, I end with a summary and a discussion
about the potentiality of the measurements at the LHC - particularly those made

SPS and RHIC data, and theoretical models.

We find a quadrupole modification to the ordinary isotropic spectrum. Moreover,
this deviation from statistical isotropy is scale-dependent, with a $\sim
-1/k^2$ factor. This result implies that the statistical anisotropy mainly
appears on large scales, while the spectrum on small scales remains highly
isotropic. Moreover, due to this $-1/k^2$ factor, the power on large scales is
suppressed. Thus, our model can simultaneously explain the observed anisotropic
alignments of the low-$\ell$ multipoles and their low power.

result of partial wave analysis indicates that the $V\bar{V}$ systems are
predominately pseudoscalar component, and most of these channels have
relatively large branching ratios at an order of $10^{-3}$. Meanwhile, vector
mesons, such as $\rho$, $\omega$ and $K^*$, have strong couplings with nucleons
and/or hyperons. This suggests a dynamical mechanism describing the $\eta
p\bar{p}$ form factors for higher $\eta$ mesons, such as $\eta(1405/1475)$ and
$\eta(1760)$. It is thus natural to expect that rescatterings of these vector
meson pairs into $p\bar{p}$ of $0^-$ partial wave could be an important source
contributing to $J/\psi\to\gamma p\bar{p}$ of which the branching ratio is at
the order of $10^{-4}$. Our calculation justifies this point. In particular, we
find that interferences between different rescattering amplitudes can produce a
significant threshold enhancement in the invariant mass spectrum of $p\bar{p}$.
Without introducing dramatic ingredients, our model provides a natural
explanation for the peculiar threshold enhancement observed by BES-II in
$J/\psi\to \gamma p\bar{p}$. Additional experimental constraints on the
$V\bar{V}\to p\bar{p}$ transitions are examined. This mechanism in $J/\psi\to

covering the period from the end of a superoutburst through the following
normal outburst of the system. Here, we present the quiescent spectra. They
contain at least three components. The dominant component is the white dwarf
(WD), which cools following the superoutburst. The amount of cooling depends
somewhat on the WD models used. For log g of 8.0, the temperature drops from
24,000K just after the outburst to 20,000 K just before the normal outburst.
For this model, and a distance of 65 pc, the WD radius is ~8 x 10**8 cm and v
sin(i) is ~420 km/s. The fact that the derived radius is smaller than expected
for a WD with log g=8 suggests a higher gravity WD or that VW Hyi is somewhat
further than 65 pc. Either is possible given the current distance uncertainty
of +-20 pc. Earlier suggestions that the WD photosphere shows evidence of CNO
processed material are confirmed, but our analysis also shows that issues
remain in terms of analyzing the spectra of WDs in such unusual physical
situations. The second component is relatively featureless and shows modulation
on the orbital (and just after outburst, the superhump) period. It is likely
associated with the hot spot where material from the secondary encounters the
disk, rather than the boundary layer region between the inner disk and WD. The
second component fades ~10 days after the superoutburst. There is also a third
component, clearly visible in broad emission lines of C III 977, N III 991,
Lyman Beta and O VI 1032,1038, which appears to be accompanied by a flat
continuum. The strength of the emission lines, which are almost surely

Principle only if the Lagrangian and the constraints are preserved not only by
the gauge transformations but also by an additional family of transformations,

$SFH$ of these solid tori forms a ""categorification of Pascal's triangle"", and
contact structures correspond bijectively to chord diagrams, or sets of
disjoint properly embedded arcs in the disc. Their contact elements are
distinct and form distinguished subsets of $SFH$ of order given by the Narayana

to define a QFT-type basis of $SFH$, consisting of contact elements. Sutured
Floer homology in this case reduces to the combinatorics of chord diagrams. We
prove that contact elements are in bijective correspondence with comparable
pairs of basis elements with respect to a certain partial order. The algebraic
and combinatorial structures in this description have intrinsic
contact-topological meaning. In particular, the QFT-basis of $SFH$ and its
partial order have a natural interpretation in pure contact topology, related
to the contact category of a disc: the partial order enables us to tell when
the sutured solid cylinder obtained by ""stacking"" two chord diagrams has a
tight contact structure. This leads us to extend Honda's notion of contact
category to a ""bounded"" contact category, containing chord diagrams and contact
structures which occur within a given contact solid cylinder. We compute this
bounded contact category in certain cases. Moreover, the decomposition of a
contact element into basis elements naturally gives a triple of contact
structures on solid cylinders which we regard as a type of ""distinguished

of integral curves of the field. Computed by a six-dimensional integral, it is
widely useful in the physics of fluids. For a divergence-free field tangent to
the boundary of a domain in 3-space, helicity is known to be invariant under
volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of the domain that are homotopic to the
identity. We give a new construction of helicity for closed $(k+1)$-forms on a
domain in $(2k+1)$-space that vanish when pulled back to the boundary of the
domain. Our construction expresses helicity in terms of a cohomology class
represented by the form when pulled back to the compactified configuration
space of pairs of points in the domain. We show that our definition is
equivalent to the standard one. We use our construction to give a new formula
for computing helicity by a four-dimensional integral. We provide a Biot-Savart
operator that computes a primitive for such forms; utilizing it, we obtain
another formula for helicity. As a main result, we find a general formula for
how much the value of helicity changes when the form is pushed forward by a
diffeomorphism of the domain; it relies upon understanding the effect of the
diffeomorphism on the homology of the domain and the de Rham cohomology class
represented by the form. Our formula allows us to classify the
helicity-preserving diffeomorphisms on a given domain, finding new
helicity-preserving diffeomorphisms on the two-holed solid torus, and proving
that there are no new helicity-preserving diffeomorphisms on the standard solid
torus. We conclude by defining helicities for forms on submanifolds of
Euclidean space. In addition, we provide a detailed exposition of some standard
`folk' theorems about the cohomology of the boundary of domains in $\R^{2k+1}$.

leads us to consider the Group Lasso as a candidate estimation method. We show
that this estimator enjoys nice sparsity oracle inequalities and variable
selection properties. The results hold under a certain restricted eigenvalue
condition and a coherence condition on the design matrix, which naturally
extend recent work in Bickel et al. [2007], Lounici [2008]. In particular, in
the multi-task learning scenario, in which the number of tasks can grow, we are
able to remove completely the effect of the number of predictor variables in
the bounds. Finally, we show how our results can be extended to more general
noise distributions, of which we only require the variance to be finite.

Netflix Prize and other similar questions in collaborative filtering. In
general, accurate recovery of a matrix from a small number of entries is
impossible; but the knowledge that the unknown matrix has low rank radically
changes this premise, making the search for solutions meaningful.
  This paper presents optimality results quantifying the minimum number of
entries needed to recover a matrix of rank r exactly by any method whatsoever
(the information theoretic limit). More importantly, the paper shows that,
under certain incoherence assumptions on the singular vectors of the matrix,
recovery is possible by solving a convenient convex program as soon as the
number of entries is on the order of the information theoretic limit (up to
logarithmic factors). This convex program simply finds, among all matrices
consistent with the observed entries, that with minimum nuclear norm. As an
example, we show that on the order of nr log(n) samples are needed to recover a
random n x n matrix of rank r by any method, and to be sure, nuclear norm
minimization succeeds as soon as the number of entries is of the form nr

calculate bond energy and local spin susceptibility near the defect, both of

correlations at characteristic incommensurate wavevectors that are revealed
near the defect. Thus, the bond energy shows a static texture oscillating as a
function of distance from the defect and decaying as a slow power law. The
local spin susceptibility also oscillates and actually {\it increases} as a
function of distance from the defect, similar to the effect found in the 1D

by three $N\times N$ hermitian matrices $\Phi_i, i=1,2,3$. The inflation
potential of our model, which is strongly motivated from string theory, is
constructed from $\Phi_{i}$ and their commutators. We show that one can
consistently restrict the classical dynamics to a sector in which the $\Phi_i$
are proportional to the $N\times N$ irreducible representations of SU(2). In
this sector our model effectively behaves as an N-flation model with $3 N^2$
number of fields and the effective inflaton field has a super-Planckian field
value. Furthermore, the fine-tunings associated with unnaturally small
couplings in the chaotic type inflationary scenarios are removed. Due to the
matrix nature of the inflaton fields there are $3N^2-1$ extra scalar fields in
the dynamics. These have the observational effects such as production of
iso-curvature perturbations on cosmic microwave background. Moreover, the
existence of these extra scalars provides us with a natural preheating
mechanism and exit from inflation. As the effective inflaton field can traverse
super-Planckian distances in the field space, the model is capable of producing
a considerable amount of gravity waves that can be probed by future CMB
polarization experiments such as PLANCK, QUIET and CMBPOL.

totally unexplained by popular earlier models of accretion disks. The
significant rms value in power density spectrum implies that the oscillation
involves in the dynamical and non-linear variation of certain region of the
accretion disk itself. The nature of the energy dependence implies that the
region which produces Comptonized hard tail is also responsible for QPOs.
Similarly, the occurrences of the QPOs are strongly related to the jet
formation and the spectral states. These features are the natural consequences
of the advective disk paradigm that we are advocating. In the mid 90s, some of
the present authors first pointed out that the QPOs in all possible types of
black holes may be simply due to the oscillations of the CENBOL, the
CENtrifugal pressure supported BOundary Layer which is formed in the
sub-Keplerian flows around a black hole. This CENBOL could be axi-symmetric as
well as non-axisymteric in nature since its boundary, namely, the centrifugally
driven shocks could be axi-symmetric or non-axisymmetric. In addition, we
pointed out that the transition radius where the flow becomes Keplerian to
sub-Keplerian, as well as the location of the inner sonic point can also
oscillate and produce the QPOs. Since the shock locations are functions of the
specific angular momentum ($\lambda$) and specific energy (${\cal E}$) of the
flow, our model naturally predicts that the QPO frequency should vary with
mass, spin, $\lambda$ and ${\cal E}$. The QPO frequencies with specific ratios,
such as, 2:3 must be due to non-axisymmetric effects when the shock switches
between the two-armed and the three-armed spirals. We also discuss the possible
effects that the disk inclination might have with the line of sight.

This
line is an intercom- bination line and the source function is close to the
local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) value. The strong coupling to the local
temperature and the relatively high population of the lower level (the ground
state of Mg I) makes this line an ideal candidate for temperature diagnostics
in the lower chromosphere/temperature minimum region. Linking the temperature
probed to an absolute phys- ical height is non trivial because of Non-LTE
ionization. We analyze the Non-LTE effects and find that photo-ionization from
the lower energy levels together with cascading collisional recombination
dominate the ionization balance. Taking properly into account the
line-blanketing in the UV is essen- tial for obtaining the right
photoionization rates. The identification of the main Non-LTE effects in the
line allows us to construct a quintessential model atom, ideal for
computationally demanding tasks, e.g. full 3D and/or time-dependent radiative
transfer. Furthermore we analyze the diagnostic potential to temperature of
this line in solar-like atmospheres, by synthesizing the line from a series of
parametrized atmospheric models. These models have been constructed with fixed
effective temper- ature, but with a variable heat term in the energy equation
to obtain a chromospheric temperature rise at different heights. We conclude
that the line has a significant potential in the diagnostics of the lower
chromosphere temperature structure, especially for cooler atmospheres, such as
sunspots.

galaxy (LIRG) Arp299 (IC694 + NGC3690) covering the central 45arcsec ~ 9kpc.
The integrated mid-IR spectrum of Arp299 is similar to that of local starbursts
despite its strongly interacting nature and high infrared luminosity, L_IR ~
6x10^11 Lsun. This is explained because the star formation (probed by e.g. high
[NeIII]15.56micron/[NeII]micron line ratios) is spread across at least 6-8kpc.
Moreover, a large fraction of this star formation is taking place in young
regions of moderate mid-IR optical depths such as the C+C' complex in the
overlap region between the two galaxies and in HII regions in the disks of the
galaxies. It is only source A, the nuclear region of IC694, that shows the
typical mid-IR characteristics of ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs, L_IR
> 10^12 Lsun), that is, very compact (less than 1kpc) and dust-enshrouded star
formation resulting in a deep silicate feature and moderate equivalent widths
of the PAHs. The nuclear region of NGC3690, known as source B1, hosts a
low-luminosity AGN and is surrounded by regions of star formation. Although the
high excitation [NeV]14.32micron line typical of AGN is not detected in B1, its
upper limit is consistent with the value expected from the X-ray luminosity.
The AGN emission is detected in the form of a strong hot dust component that
accounts for 80-90% of the 6micron luminosity of B1. The similarity between the
Arp299 integrated mid-IR spectrum and those of high-z ULIRGs suggests that
Arp299 may represent a local example, albeit with lower IR luminosity and
possibly higher metallicity, of the star-formation processes occurring at
high-z.

autoregression and the assumption of no in-network data fusion, the behavior of
the total obtainable information [nats] and energy efficiency [nats/J] defined
as the ratio of total gathered information to the required energy is obtained
as the coverage area, node density and energy vary. When the sensor node
density is fixed, the energy efficiency decreases to zero with rate
$\Theta({area}^{-1/2})$ and the per-node information under fixed per-node
energy also diminishes to zero with rate $O(N_t^{-1/3})$ as the number $N_t$ of

$d_n$ increases, the per-node information converges to its limit $D$ with rate
$D-\sqrt{d_n}e^{-\alpha d_n}$ for a given diffusion rate $\alpha$. When the
coverage area is fixed and the node density increases, the per-node information
is inversely proportional to the node density. As the total energy $E_t$
consumed in the network increases, the total information obtainable from the
network is given by $O(\log E_t)$ for the fixed node density and fixed coverage

asteroid that formed a debris disk now supplying the matter accreting onto the
white dwarf. To reach any clear conclusions from the observed composition of
the white dwarf atmosphere to that of the circumstellar matter, we need a
detailed understanding of the accretion and diffusion process, in particular
the diffusion timescales. We aim to provide data for a wide range of white
dwarf parameters and all possible observed chemical elements. Starting from
atmosphere models, we calculate the structure of the outer envelopes, obtaining
the depth of the convection zone and the physical parameters at the lower
boundary. These parameters are used to calculate the diffusion velocities using
calculations of diffusion coefficients available in the literature. With a
simple example, we demonstrate that the observed element abundances are not
identical to the accreted abundances. Reliable conclusions are possible only if
we know or can assume that the star has reached a steady state between
accretion and diffusion. In this case, most element abundances differ only by
factors in the range 2-4 between atmospheric values and the circumstellar
matter. Knowing the diffusion timescales, we can also accurately relate the
accreted abundances to the observed ones. If accretion has stopped, or if the
rates vary by large amounts, we cannot determine the composition of the
accreted matter with any certainty.

These are triggered as the cluster gas tries to cool, but rapidly quenched by
the resulting shock heating. This mechanism is close to the optimum efficiency

in most cases the strength of associations between individuals is disregarded.
Secondly, present techniques assume that observed interactions are invariant
values and not statistical samples taken from a population. These two
simplifications have weakened the value of these techniques when applied to the
study of animal social systems. Here we introduce a set of behaviorally
meaningful weighted network statistics that can be readily applied to matrices
of association indices between pairs of individual animals. We also introduce
bootstrapping techniques that estimate the effects of sampling uncertainty on
the network statistics and structure. Finally, we discuss the use of
randomisation tests to detect the departure of observed network statistics from
expected values under null hypotheses of random association given the sampling
structure of the data. We use two case studies to show that these techniques
provide invaluable insight in the dynamics of interactions within social units

mean projector of rank k on the leading subspace shows instead that most of the

characterized by either weak (YBCO-like) or strong (MgB$_2$-like) links, occurs
through a series of avalanche-type current density rearrangements. These
rearrangements correspond to the creation of resistive layers, crossing the
whole specimen approximately orthogonal to the current density direction, due
to the simultaneous transition of a large number of weak-links or grains. The
present work shows that exact solution of the Kirchhoff equations for strongly
and weakly linked networks of nonlinear resistors, with Josephson junction
characteristics, yield the subsequent formation of resistive layers within the
superconductive matrix as temperature increases. Furthermore, the voltage noise
observed at the transition is related to the resistive layer formation process.
The noise intensity is estimated from the superposition of voltage drop
elementary events related to the subsequent resistive layers. At the end of the
transition, the layers mix-up, the step amplitude decreases and the resistance
curve smoothes. This results in the suppression of noise, as experimentally
found. Remarkably, a scaling law for the noise intensity with the network size
is argued. It allows to extend the results to networks with arbitrary size and,
thus, to real specimens.

underdense region, which challenges the Copernican principle. We show that the
integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect is an excellent discriminator between
anti-Copernican inhomogeneous models and the standard Copernican models. As a
reference model, we consider an anti-Copernican inhomogeneous model that
consists of two inner negatively curved underdense regions and an outer flat
Einstein-de Sitter region. We assume that these regions are connected by two
thin-walls at redshifts z = 0.067 and z=0.45. In the inner two regions, the
first-order ISW effect is dominant and comparable to that in the concordant
flat-Lambda models. In the outer Einstein-de Sitter region, the first-order ISW
effect vanishes but the second-order ISW effect plays a dominant role, while
the first-order ISW effect is dominant in the flat-Lambda models at moderate
redshifts. This difference can discrimate the anti-Copernican models from the
concordant flat-Lambda model. At high redshits, the second-order ISW effect is
dominant both in our inhomogeneous model and the concordant model. In the outer
region, moreover, the ISW effect due to large-scale density perturbations with
a present matter density contrast much less than 0.37 is negligible, while the
effect due to small-scale density perturbations (such as clusters of galaxies,
superclusters and voids) with matter density contrast much larger than 0.37
would generate anisotropies which are larger than those generated by the ISW
effect in the concordant model.

living organisms. Whereas biologists have proposed models where the shape is
controlled on a molecular level [1], physicists, following Turing [2] and
d'Arcy Thomson [3], have developed theories where patterns arise spontaneously
[4]. Here, we propose a volume constraint that restricts the possible shapes of
leaves. Focusing on palmate leaves, the central observation is that developing
leaves first grow folded inside a bud, limited by the previous and subsequent
leaves. We show that growing folded in this small volume controls globally the
leaf development. This induces a direct relationship between the way it was
folded and the final unfolded shape of the leaf. These dependencies can be
approximated as simple geometrical relationships that we confirm on both folded
embryonic and unfolded mature leaves. We find that independently of their
position in the phylogenetic tree, these relationships work for folded species,
but do not work for non-folded species. This steric constraint is a simple way
to impose a global regulation for the leaf growth. Such steric regulation
should be more general and considered as a new simple means of global
regulation.

to emerge from an anisotropic 3D metallic state, upon which antiferromagnetism
opposes superconductivity by driving the doped holes towards localization.
Despite the competition, the superconductivity sets in before the AF order is

nonequilibrium dynamics of interacting quantum many-body systems, we
investigate the nonequilibrium properties of a Fermi liquid. We apply an
interaction quench within the Fermi liquid phase of the Hubbard model by
switching on a weak interaction suddenly; then we follow the real-time dynamics
of the momentum distribution by a systematic expansion in the interaction
strength based on the flow equation method. In this paper we derive our main
results, namely the applicability of a quasiparticle description, the
observation of a new type of quasi-stationary nonequilibrium Fermi liquid like
state and a delayed thermalization of the momentum distribution. We explain the
physical origin of the delayed relaxation as a consequence of phase space
constraints in fermionic many-body systems. This brings about a close relation
to similar behavior of one-particle systems which we illustrate by a discussion
of the squeezed oscillator; we generalize to an extended class of systems with
discrete energy spectra and point out the generic character of the
nonequilibrium Fermi liquid results for weak interaction quenches. Both for
discrete and continuous systems we observe that particular nonequilibrium
expectation values are twice as large as their corresponding analogues in
equilibrium. For a Fermi liquid, this shows up as an increased
correlation-induced reduction of the quasiparticle residue in nonequilibrium.

means of the Langevin fitting, the diameter of the NP was estimated to be lower

varied from 48.5 em/g to 19 emu/g, with the higher value corresponding to a
larger particle size. A core-shell structure of the NP was adopted, with the NP

in the Galactic inner halo, with estimated $UVW$ space velocities indicating a
slightly prograde, eccentric and inclined Galactic orbit (3.5 <~ R <~ 11 kpc;
|Zmax| = 7.5 kpc). Comparison to synthetic spectra computed with the Phoenix

observed spectra particularly in the red optical region. The stronger
metal-oxide bands present in the Drift-Phoenix model spectra, a result of
phase-non-equilibrium abundances of grain species, appears to contradict prior
suggestions that grain formation is inhibited in metal-poor atmospheres;
conclusive statements on the metallicity dependence of grain formation
