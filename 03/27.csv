Bell inequality (1964) in a local hidden variable (LHV) frame. This condition
can be checked experimentally and incorporates only as a particular case the
assumption on perfect correlations or anticorrelations usually argued for this
inequality in the literature. Specifying this general condition for a quantum
bipartite case, we introduce the whole class of bipartite quantum states,
separable and nonseparable, that (i) admit an LHV description under any
bipartite measurements with two settings per site; (ii) do not necessarily
exhibit perfect correlations and may even have a negative correlation function
if the same quantum observable is measured at both sites but (iii) satisfy the
""perfect correlation"" version of the original Bell inequality for any three
bounded quantum observables A, A'=B, B' at sites ""A"" and ""B"", respectively.
Analysing the validity of this general LHV condition under classical and
quantum correlation experiments with the same physical context, we stress that,
unlike the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality, the original Bell
inequality distinguishes between classicality and quantum separability.

ground-based optical follow-ups. The temporal and spectral indices of the X-ray
afterglow emission change remarkably. We interpret this as the GRB jet first
traversing the freely expanding supersonic stellar wind of the progenitor with
density varying as $\rho \propto r^{-2}$. Then after approximately 300 sec the
jet traverses into a region of apparent constant density similar to that
expected in the stalled-wind region of a stellar wind bubble or the
interstellar medium (ISM). The optical afterglow data are generally consistent
with such a scenario. Our best numerical model has a wind density parameter
{$A_{*} \sim 0.02$, a density of the stalled wind $n\sim 0.12 {\rm cm}^{-3}$,
and a transition radius $ \sim 4.5 \times 10^{17}$ cm}. Such a transition
radius is smaller than that predicted by numerical simulations of the stellar
wind bubbles and may be due to a rapidly evolving wind of the progenitor close
to the time of its core-collapse.

several toy models of $f(G)$ dark energy are explored. Cosmologically viable

our bound uses only simple properties of sigma and is applicable in wide

depending on the strength of the coupling. For weak coupling, we found quantum
localization similar to that exhibited by single kicked rotors. For strong
coupling, we found a quasi-diffusive growth of the width of the momentum

increased. The behavior in this regime can be described by the scaling theory
of weak localization for two-dimensional disordered lattices. The weak and

A, then G:=A^x and G_E:=B^x are sets of rational points of reductive groups
defined over F and E respectively. Broussous and Lemaire have defined a map
j_E: I^{E^x}\to I_E, where $I$ is the the Euclidean building of $G$, and I_E is
the Euclidean building of G_E. The question which we address is to relate the
embedding invariants to the behavior of the map j_E with respect to the
simplicial structures of $I$ and I_E. I have to thank very much Prof. Zink from

Milky Way or M31. Currently, there are two clear exceptions to this rule, and
the Tucana dwarf galaxy is the most distant at almost 1 Mpc from the Milky Way.
Using the VLT/FORS2 spectrograph in multi-object mode we were able to measure
the velocities of 23 individual Red Giant Branch stars in and around Tucana
using the Ca triplet absorption lines. From this sample 17 reliable members
have been identified. We measured the systemic velocity and dispersion of
Tucana to be v_hel = +194.0+-4.3 km/s and sigma_l.o.s. = 15.8+4.1-3.1 km/s
respectively. These measures are derived after removing the signature of
rotation using a linear gradient of 6.5 x R/R_core+-2.9 km/s, which corresponds
to a rotation of 16 km/s at the reliable limit of our data. Our systemic
velocity corresponds to a receding velocity from the barycentre of the Local
Group of v_LG = +73.3 km/s. We also determined the mean metallicity of Tucana
to be [Fe/H] = -1.95+-0.15 with a dispersion of 0.32+-0.06 dex. Our study
firmly excludes any obvious association of Tucana with the HI emission in the
vicinity and shows that Tucana is a genuine dwarf spheroidal, with low
metallicity stars, no gaseous ISM and no recent star formation. The present
location and relatively high recession velocity are consistent with Tucana
having been an isolated Local Group galaxy for the majority of its existence.

[ABC(-)]. The use of PBC(+) produces a rich phase structure. These phases are
distinguished by the eigenvalues of the Polyakov loop P. Minimization of the
effective potential for QCD(AS/S,+) results in a phase where | Im Tr P | is
maximized, resulting in charge conjugation (C) symmetry breaking for all N and
all values of (m beta), however, the partition function is the same up to
O(1/N) corrections as when ABC are applied. Therefore, regarding orientifold
planar equivalence, we argue that in the one-loop approximation C-breaking in
QCD(AS/S,+) resulting from the application of PBC to fermions does not
invalidate the large N equivalence with QCD(Adj,-). Similarly, with respect to
orbifold planar equivalence, breaking of Z(2) interchange symmetry resulting

invalidate equivalence with QCD(Adj,-) in the one-loop perturbative limit

particular interest as well is the case of adjoint fermions where for Nf > 1
Majorana flavour confinement is obtained for sufficiently small (m beta), and
deconfinement for sufficiently large (m beta). For N >= 3 these two phases are
separated by one or more additional phases, some of which can be characterized

predicting the spectrum of ionized, atomic, and molecular environments in

ionizing radiation density to particle density (i.e. high ionization

Physically, as U increases, the fraction of UV photons absorbed by dust
increases, corresponding to fewer photons available to photoionize and heat the
gas, producing what is known as a ""dust-bounded"" nebula. We show that high U
effects can explain the ""[C II] deficit"", the ~1 dex drop in the [C II] 158
micron /FIR ratio seen in ULIRGs when compared to starburst or normal galaxies.
Additionally, by increasing U through increasing the ionizing photon flux,
warmer dust and thus higher IRAS F(60)/F(100) ratios result. High U effects
also predict an increase in [O I]63 micron /[C II] 158 micron and a gradual
decline in [O III] 88 micron /FIR, similar to the magnitude of the trends

show that their large deviations occur at the stretched-exponential scale. More
precisely, the probability that mass exp(-R^gamma) in a cell travels distance R
decays like exp(-R^f_d(gamma)) where we identify the functions f_d exactly.
These functions are piecewise smooth and the discontinuities of f_d' represent
phase transitions. In dimension d=3, the large deviation is due to a ``distant
attracting galaxy'' but a phase transition occurs when f_3(gamma)=1 (at that
point, the fluctuations due to individual stars dominate). When d>=5, the large
deviation is due to a thin tube (a ``wormhole'') along which the star density
increases monotonically, until the point f_d(gamma)=1 (where again fluctuations
due to individual stars dominate). In dimension 4 we find a double phase
transition, where the transition between low-dimensional behavior (attracting
galaxy) and high-dimensional behavior (wormhole) occurs at gamma=4/3.

time path integral formalism. The base pair stretchings are described by an
ensemble of paths selected through a macroscopic constraint, the fulfillement
of the second law of thermodynamics. The number of paths contributing to the
partition function strongly increases around and above a specific temperature
$T^*_c$ whereas the fraction of unbound base pairs grows continuosly around and
above $T^*_c$. The latter is identified with the denaturation temperature.
Thus, the separation of the two complementary strands appears as a highly
cooperative phenomenon displaying a smooth crossover versus $T$. The
thermodynamical properties have been computed in a large temperature range by
varying the size of the path ensemble at the lower bound of the range. No
significant physical dependence on the system size has been envisaged. The
entropy grows continuosly versus $T$ while the specific heat displays a
remarkable peak at $T^*_c$. The location of the peak versus $T$ varies with the
stiffness of the anharmonic stacking interaction along the strand. The
presented results suggest that denaturation in homogeneous DNA has the features
of a second order phase transition. The method accounts for the cooperative
behavior of a very large number of degrees of freedom while the computation
time is kept within a reasonable limit.

two-component entropic measure for the multiscale analysis of

dissimilarity per cell of the actual configurational macrostate and the
theoretical reference one that maximizes entropy. Two kinds of disorder
compete: i) the spatial one connected with possible positions of pillars inside
a cell (the first component of the measure), ii) the compositional one linked
to compositions of each local sum of their integer heights into a number of
pillars occupying the cell (the second component). As both the number of
pillars and sum of their heights are conserved, the upper limit for a pillar
height hmax occurs. If due to a further constraint there is the more demanding
limit h <= h* < hmax, the exact number of restricted compositions can be then
obtained only through the generating function. However, at least for systems
with exclusively composition degrees of freedom, we show that the neglecting of
the h* is not destructive yet for a nice correlation of the h*-constrained
entropic measure and its less demanding counterpart, which is much easier to
compute. Given examples illustrate a broad applicability of the measure and its
ability to quantify some of the subtleties of a fractional Brownian motion,
time evolution of a quasipattern [28,29] and reconstruction of a laser-speckle

field. An explicit example in de Sitter space-time shows that it is still
possible to eliminate the negative norm state and to ensure the positivity of
the energy in this theory. The new state is decoupled from the conserved
electromagnetic currents, but is non-conformally coupled to gravity and
therefore can be excited from vacuum fluctuations by the expanding background.
The cosmological evolution ensures that the new state modifies Maxwell's

cosmological scales it can give rise to a non-negligible energy density which

of satellites as a function of luminosity, by applying the selection criteria
of the SDSS survey to our simulations instead of correcting the observations

the luminosity and radial distributions of MW satellites. We investigate which
physical processes in our models are responsible for shaping the predicted

are systematically lower than those expected from `canonical' simple stellar
population models, which do not account for the preferential loss of low-mass
stars due to energy equipartition. It was recently shown that low-mass star
depletion can qualitatively explain the M/L discrepancy. To verify whether it
is indeed the driving mechanism, we derive dissolution timescales and use these
to predict the M/L_V ratios of the 24 Galactic GCs for which orbital parameters
and dynamical M/L_V are known. We also predict the slopes of their low-mass
stellar mass functions (MFs). We use the SPACE cluster models, which include
dynamical dissolution, low-mass star depletion, stellar evolution, stellar
remnants and various metallicities. The predicted M/L_V are in 1 sigma
agreement with the observations for 12 out of 24 GCs. The discrepancy for the
other GCs probably arises because our predictions give global M/L ratios, while
the observations represent extrapolated central values that are different from
global ones in case of mass segregation and a long dissolution timescale. GCs
in our sample which likely have dissimilar global and central M/L ratios can be
excluded by imposing limits on the dissolution timescale and King parameter.
For the remaining GCs, the observed and predicted average M/L_V are 78^+9_-11%
and 78+/-2% of the canonically expected values, while for the entire sample the
values are 74^+6_-7% and 85+/-1%. The predicted correlation between the slope
of the low-mass stellar MF and M/L_V is qualitatively consistent with observed
MF slopes. It is concluded that the variation of M/L ratio due to dissolution
and low-mass star depletion is a plausible explanation for the discrepancy
between the observed and canonically expected M/L ratios of GCs. (Abridged)

does not depend strongly on galactic half-light radius or cluster properties

the cluster galaxies in locally rich environments have higher median
metallicities by up to ~ 0.05 dex than those in locally poor environments (or
without a near neighbour). Control (non-cluster) galaxies at locally high

the angular power spectrum is dominated by a noise-like term, with suppression
due to internal structure of relevant subhalos. If the mass spectrum extends
down to Earth-mass scale, then the subhalos would be detected in the anisotropy
with Fermi at angular scales of ~10 deg, if their contribution to the gamma-ray

anisotropy detection requires that the subhalo contribution to the gamma-ray

particle physics parameters. We also find that the anisotropy analysis could be
a more sensitive probe for the subhalos than individual detection. We also
study dependence on model parameters, where we reach the similar conclusions
for all the models investigated. The analytic approach should be very useful

find that multiple pattern speeds are common in disk galaxies. By selecting
those corotation radii close to or slightly larger than the bar radius as being
the bar corotation (CR) radius, we find that the average and standard deviation
of the ratio R = r(CR)/r(bar), is 1.20+/-0.52 for 101 galaxies having
well-defined bars. There is an indication that this ratio depends weakly on
galaxy type in the sense that the average ranges from 1.03+/-0.37 for 65
galaxies of type Sbc and earlier, to 1.50+/-0.63 for 36 galaxies of type Sc and
later. Our bar corotation radii are on average smaller than those estimated
from single-pattern-speed numerical simulations, most likely because these
simulations tend to find the pattern speed which generates a density response
in the gas that best matches the morphology of the outer spiral structure.
Although we find CR radii in most of the sample galaxies that satisfy
conventional ideas about the extent of bars, we also consider the alternative
interpretation that in many cases the bar CR is actually inside the bar and
that the bar ends close to its outer Lindblad resonance instead of its CR. We
see evidence in the phase-shift distributions for ongoing decoupling of
patterns. We also examine how uncertainties in the orientation parameters of

nuclear polarization (DNP), as it exhibits a continuum of properties from

At low doping concentrations DNP has been observed to occur via the solid
effect, while at very high doping concentrations an Overhauser mechanism is
responsible. Here we report the hyperpolarization of 29Si in n-doped silicon
crystals, with doping concentrations in the range of 1-3 x 10^17 /cc. In this
regime exchange interactions between donors become extremely important. The
sign of the enhancement in our experiments and its frequency dependence suggest
that the 29Si spins are directly polarized by donor electrons via an Overhauser
mechanism within exchange-coupled donor clusters. The exchange interaction
between donors only needs to be larger than the silicon hyperfine interaction
(typically much smaller than the donor hyperfine coupling) to enable this
Overhauser mechanism. Nuclear polarization enhancement is observed for a range
of donor clusters in which the exchange energy is comparable to the donor
hyperfine interaction. The DNP dynamics are characterized by a single
exponential time constant that depends on the microwave power, indicating that
the Overhauser mechanism is the rate-limiting step. Since only about 2 % of the
silicon nuclei are located within one Bohr radius of the donor electron,
nuclear spin diffusion is important in transferring the polarization to all the
spins. However, the spin-diffusion time is much shorter than the Overhauser
time due to the relatively weak silicon hyperfine coupling strength. In a 2.35
T magnetic field at 1.1 K, we observed a DNP enhancement of $244 +/- 84

construct observables that directly measure the spin of a heavy unstable
particle. A novelty of the approach is that the analysis of the azimuthal angle
dependence in a frame other than the usual helicity frame offers an independent
cross-check on the extraction of the spin. Moreover, in some instances when the
transverse polarisation tensor of highest rank is vanishing, for an accidental
or dynamical reason, the standard azimuthal asymmetries vanish and would lead
to a measurement with a wrong spin assignment. In a frame such as the one we
construct, the correct spin assignment would however still be possible. The
method gives direct information about the spin of the particle under
consideration and the same event sample can be used to identify the spins of
each particle in a decay chain. A drawback of the method is that it is
instrumental only when the momenta of the test particle can be reconstructed.
However we hope that it might still be of use in situations with only partial
reconstruction. We also derive the conditions on the production and decay
mechanisms for the spins, and hence the polarisations, to be measured at a
collider experiment. As an example for the use of the method we consider the
simultaneous reconstruction, at the partonic level, of the spin of both the top
and the $W$ in top pair production in $e^+ e^-$ in the semi-leptonic channel.

corresponding conservation law. For example, invariance with respect to spatial
translation corresponds to conservation of momentum. In another well-known
example, invariance with respect to rotation of the electrons spin, or SU(2)
symmetry, leads to conservation of spin polarization. For electrons in a solid,
this symmetry is ordinarily broken by spin-orbit coupling, allowing spin
angular momentum to flow to orbital angular momentum. However, it has recently
been predicted that SU(2) can be achieved in a two-dimensional electron gas,
despite the presence of spin-orbit coupling. The corresponding conserved
quantities include the amplitude and phase of a helical spin density wave
termed the persistent spin helix. SU(2) is realized, in principle, when the
strength of two dominant spin-orbit interactions, the Rashba (strength
parameterized by \alpha) and linear Dresselhaus (\beta_1), are equal. This
symmetry is predicted to be robust against all forms of spin-independent
scattering, including electron-electron interactions, but is broken by the
cubic Dresselhaus term (\beta_3) and spin-dependent scattering. When these
terms are negligible, the distance over which spin information can propagate is
predicted to diverge as \alpha approaches \beta_1. Here we observe
experimentally the emergence of the persistent spin helix in GaAs quantum wells
by independently tuning \alpha and \beta_1. Using transient spin-grating
spectroscopy, we find a spin-lifetime enhancement of two orders of magnitude

wavelengths up to soft gamma-rays with the INTEGRAL satellite, from 2005
February to September. X-ray novae are extreme systems that often harbor a
black hole, and are known to emit throughout the electromagnetic spectrum when
in outburst. We analyzed radio, (N)IR, optical, X-ray and soft gamma-ray
observations and constructed simultaneous broad-band X-ray spectra. Analyzing
both the light curves in various energy ranges and the hardness-intensity
diagram enabled us to study the long-term behavior of the source. Spectral
parameters were typical of the Soft Intermediate States and the High Soft
States of a black hole candidate. The source showed relatively small spectral
variations in X-rays with considerable flux variation in radio. Spectral
studies showed that the accretion disc cooled down from 0.64 to 0.27 keV in 100
days and that the total flux decreased while the relative flux of the hot
medium increased. Radio emission was detected several times, and,
interestingly, five days after entering the HSS. Modeling the spectral energy
distribution from the radio to the soft gamma-rays reveals that the radio
flares arise from several ejection events. XTE J1818-245 is likely a black hole
candidate transient source that might be closer than the Galactic Bulge. The
results from the data analysis trace the physical changes that took place in

integrated colours that are relatively blue, they show a diversity of colour
gradients, possessing central core regions that are either redder, bluer, or
indistinct in colour relative to their outer regions. Kinematically, the most
striking property is the significant and unambiguous rotation that is seen in
all our E+A galaxies, with it being generally aligned close to the photometric
major axis. This is contrary to the findings of Norton et al. 2001, who found
little or no evidence for rotation in a very similar sample of nearby E+A
galaxies. We also clearly demonstrate that our E+A galaxies are, in all but one
case, consistent with being ""fast rotators"" (Emsellem et al. 2007). We argue
that the combination of disturbed morphologies and significant rotation in

equation which describes the spatio-temporal evolution of a phase variable in
an oscillatory reaction diffusion system. Synchronization manifests itself in a
stationary phase gradient where all phases throughout a system evolve with the
same velocity, the synchronization frequency. The formation of concentric waves
can be explained by local impurities of higher frequency which can entrain
their surroundings. Concentric waves in synchronization also occur in
heterogeneous systems, where the local frequencies are distributed randomly. We
present a perturbation analysis of the synchronization frequency where the
perturbation is given by the heterogeneity of natural frequencies in the
system. The nonlinearity in form of dispersion, leads to an overall
acceleration of the oscillation for which the expected value can be calculated
from the second order perturbation terms. We apply the theory to simple
topologies, like a line or the sphere, and deduce the dependence of the
synchronization frequency on the size and the dimension of the oscillatory
medium. We show that our theory can be extended to include rotating waves in a

external shock models. We have calculated the proton spectrum above 60EeV from
all gamma ray bursts distributed upto a redshift of 0.02 in the internal shock

factors at the deceleration epoch and compared with the observed data. We find

greatly reduces the number of bodies, we still track in excess of 10^5
particles. We consider three initial velocity distributions and monitor the
growth of the planetesimals. The masses of some particles increase by more than
a factor of 100. Additionally, the escape speed of the largest particle grows
considerably faster than the velocity dispersion of the particles, suggesting
impending runaway growth, although no particle grows large enough to detach
itself from the power law size-frequency distribution. These results are in
general agreement with previous statistical and analytical results. We compute
rotation rates by assuming conservation of angular momentum around the center
of mass at impact and that merged planetesimals relax to spherical shapes. At
the end of our simulations, the majority of bodies that have undergone at least
one merger are rotating faster than the breakup frequency. This implies that
the assumption of completely inelastic collisions (perfect accretion), which is
made in most simulations of planetary growth at sizes 1 km and above, is
inappropriate. Our simulations reveal that, subsequent to the number of
particles in the patch having been decreased by mergers to half its initial
value, the presence of larger bodies in neighboring regions of the disk may
limit the validity of simulations employing the patch approximation.

perpendicular to $\mathbf{P}$ and to the helical spins at small wave vector but
then turn parallel to $\mathbf{P}$ at a wave vector close to the magnetic
modulation vector. For helical magnetic structure, the spin chirality which
determines the direction of $\mathbf{P}$, also possesses a long-range order.
Due to the dynamical Dzyaloshiskii-Moriya interaction, the spin-chirality is
strongly coupled to the spin fluctuation which implies an on-site inversion of

the mass function slope (alpha) and the projected cumulative mass fraction (f)
of (CDM) substructure in strong gravitational-lens galaxies, with arcs or
Einstein rings, can be recovered as function of the lens-survey parameters and
the detection threshold of the substructure mass. The method is applied to
different sets of mock data to explore a range of observational limits: (i) the
number of lens galaxies in the survey, (ii) the mass threshold, Mlow, for the
detection of substructures and (iii) the uncertainty of the measured
substructure masses. We explore two different priors on the mass function
slope: a uniform prior and a Gaussian prior with alpha = 1.90+-0.1. With a
substructure detection threshold Mlow=3x10^8 Msun, the number of lenses
available now (n_l=30), a true dark-matter mass fraction in (CDM) substructure
<=1.0% and a prior of alpha = 1.90+-0.1, we find that the upper limit of f can
be constrained down to a level <=1.0% (95% CL). In the case of a Gaussian prior
on alpha, it is always possible to set stringent constraints on both
parameters. We also find that lowering the detection threshold has the largest
impact on the ability to recover alpha, because of the (expected) steep
mass-function slope. In the future, thanks to new surveys with telescopes, such
as SKA, LSST and JDEM and follow-up telescopes with high-fidelity data, a
significant increase in the number of known lenses will allow us to recover the
satellite population in its completeness. For example, a sample of 200 lenses,
equivalent in data-quality to the Sloan Lens ACS Survey and a detection

structural distortions of MnO6 octahedra, arising from a cooperative
Jahn-Teller and rotational distortions in these compounds. The temperature
dependence of the B1g symmetric stretching mode of the MnO6 units has revealed
either a positive or negative shift regarding the pure anharmonic temperature
dependence of the phonon frequency, which strongly depends on the
Y-concentration. This frequency renormalization is explained in terms of a
competition between ferro and antiferromagnetic interactions. The pronounced
frequency renormalization of the symmetric stretching mode for x=0.2 evidences
the predominance of the ferromagnetic interactions against the
antiferromagnetic ones, which is in good correlation with the spontaneous
magnetization measured in this compound. The emerging of the shifts referred
well above the Neel temperature is likely associated with the coupling between
phonons and dynamical fluctuations of the magnetic system, which provides
further grounds for the existence of strong spin-phonon coupling in this
compound.

benchmarked experimentally by means of recoil protons in elastic scattering
reactions, where the track coordinates are precisely predictable from simple
kinematical considerations. After application of the corrections for dynamic
distortions the corrected data have a performance equal to data where the

or induced-charge electro-osmosis (ACEO, ICEO) and induced-charge
electrophoresis (ICEP), several Volts $\approx 100 kT/e$ are applied to
polarizable surfaces in microscopic geometries, and the resulting electric
fields and induced surface charges are large enough to violate the assumptions
of the classical theory. In this article, we review the literature, highlight
discrepancies between theory and experiment, introduce possible modifications
of the theory, and analyze their consequences. We argue that, in response to a
large applied voltage, the ""compact layer"" and ""shear plane"" effectively
advance into the liquid, due to the crowding of counter-ions. Using simple
continuum models, we predict two general trends, each enhanced by dielectric
response: (i) ionic crowding against a blocking surface expands the diffuse
double layer and thus decreases its differential capacitance, and (ii) a
charge-induced viscosity increase near the surface reduces the electro-osmotic
mobility. The first effect is able to predict high-frequency flow reversal in
ACEO pumps, while the second may explain the decay of ICEO flow with increasing
salt concentration. Through examples, such as ICEP of an uncharged metal sphere
in an asymmetric electrolyte, we show that ICEO flows are ion-specific. Similar
issues arise in nanofluidics (due to confinement) and ionic liquids (due to the
lack of solvent), so the paper concludes with a general framework of modified
electrokinetic equations for finite-sized ions.

the time their gravitational-wave signals enter the frequency band of
ground-based detectors such as LIGO or VIRGO. However, it is not excluded that
some of these binaries might still possess a significant eccentricity at a few
tens of hertz. Despite this possibility, current search pipelines based on
matched filtering techniques consider only non-eccentric templates. The effect
of such an approximation on the loss of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) has been
investigated by Martel and Poisson (1999 Phys. Rev. D 60 124008) in the context
of initial LIGO detector. They ascertained that non-eccentric templates will be
successful at detecting eccentric signals. We revisit their work by
incorporating current and future ground-based detectors and precisely quantify
the exact loss of SNR. In order to be more faithful to an actual search, we
maximized the SNR over a template bank, whose minimal match is set to 95%.

depth of the tree goes to infinity the information that a typical configuration

of the measure at the root conditioned on a typical boundary can be computed
using a distributional recurrence. However the exact computation is not
feasible because the support of the distribution grows exponentially with the
depth.
  In this work, we introduce a notion of a survey of a distribution over
probability vectors which is a succinct representation of the true
distribution. We show that a survey of the distribution of the measure at the
root can be constructed by an efficient recursive algorithm. The key properties
of surveys are that the size does not grow with the depth, they can be
constructed recursively, and they still provide a good bound for the distance
between the true conditional distribution and the unconditional distribution at

water waves is studied. The fact that in irrotational flow resonant 3-wave
interactions are not possible can be invalidated by the presence of an
underlying current of constant non-zero vorticity. We show that: 1) wave trains
in flows with constant non-zero vorticity are possible only for two-dimensional
flows; 2) only positive constant vorticities can trigger the appearance of
three-wave resonances; 3) the number of positive constant vorticities which do
trigger a resonance is countable; 4) the magnitude of a positive constant
vorticity triggering a resonance can not be too small.

displayed unambiguous flares and had probabilities p_var >> 99% of being actual

maximum duration of six days and amplitude of eight times above the quiescent

the binary system formed by the B2Vp star sigma Ori E and its close late-type

space and having a smooth surface bd(K) with all principal curvatures not
exceeding c>0 at all boundary points, K necessarily has the property that to
each boundary point there exists a ball B_r of radius r=1/c, fully contained in
K and touching bd(K) at the given boundary point from the inside of K.
  In the present work we prove a discrete analogue of the result on the plane.
We consider a certain discrete condition on the curvature, namely that to any
boundary points x,y with |x-y|<t, the angle between any unit outer normals at x
and at y, resp., does not exceed a given angle s. Then we construct a
corresponding body, M(t,s), which is to lie fully within K while containing the
given boundary point x.
  In dimension 2, M is almost a regular n-gon, and the result allows to recover
the precise form of Blaschke's Rolling Ball Theorem in the limit. Similarly, we
consider the dual type discrete Blaschke theorems ensuring certain
circumscribed polygons. In the limit, the discrete theorem enables us to
provide a new proof for a strong result of Strantzen assuming only a.e.
existence and lower estimations on the curvature.

in space and time for the numerical solution of the resistive relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics (RRMHD) equations on unstructured meshes in multiple space
dimensions. The nonlinear system under consideration is purely hyperbolic and
contains a source term, the one for the evolution of the electric field, that
becomes stiff for low values of the resistivity. For the spatial discretization
we propose to use high order $\PNM$ schemes as introduced in \cite{Dumbser2008}
for hyperbolic conservation laws and a high order accurate unsplit time
discretization is achieved using the element-local space-time discontinuous
Galerkin approach proposed in \cite{DumbserEnauxToro} for one-dimensional
balance laws with stiff source terms. The divergence free character of the
magnetic field is accounted for through the divergence cleaning procedure of
Dedner et al. \cite{Dedneretal}. To validate our high order method we first
solve some numerical test cases for which exact analytical reference solutions
are known and we also show numerical convergence studies in the stiff limit of
the RRMHD equations using $\PNM$ schemes from third to fifth order of accuracy
in space and time. We also present some applications with shock waves such as a
classical shock tube problem with different values for the conductivity as well
as a relativistic MHD rotor problem and the relativistic equivalent of the
Orszag-Tang vortex problem. We have verified that the proposed method can
handle equally well the resistive regime and the stiff limit of ideal
relativistic MHD. For these reasons it provides a powerful tool for
relativistic astrophysical simulations involving the appearance of magnetic
reconnection.
