can be used to distinguish modified gravity and dark energy models in
explaining cosmic acceleration. We explore here the inclusion of spatial
curvature into the growth factor. We expand previous results using the
approximation $\Omega_{m}^\gamma$ and then suggest a new form,
$f_a=\Omega_m^\gamma+(\gamma-4/7)\Omega_k$, as an approximation for the growth
factor when the curvature $\Omega_k$ is not negligible, and where the growth
index $\gamma$ is usually model dependent. The expression recovers the standard
results for the curved and flat $\Lambda$CDM and Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati
models. Using the best fit values of $\Omega_{m0}$ and $\Omega_{k0}$ to the
expansion/distance measurements from Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic
oscillation, WMAP5, and $H(z)$ data, we fit the growth index parameter to
current growth factor data and obtain $\gamma_{\Lambda}(\Omega_{k} \not= 0) =
0.65^{+0.17}_{-0.15}$ and $\gamma_{DGP}(\Omega_{k} \not= 0) =
0.53^{+0.14}_{-0.12}$. For the $\Lambda$CDM model, the 1-$\sigma$ observational
bounds are found consistent with theoretical value, unlike the case for the
Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati model. We also find that the current data we used is
not enough to put significant constraints when the 3 parameters in $f_a$ are
fit simultaneously. Importantly, we find that, in the presence of curvature,
the analytical expression proposed for $f_a$ provides a better fit to the
growth factor than other forms and should be useful for future high precision
missions and studies.

  Learning","41 pages, 15 figures",,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers a conjecture-based distributed learning approach that
enables autonomous nodes to independently optimize their transmission
probabilities in random access networks. We model the interaction among
multiple self-interested nodes as a game. It is well-known that the Nash
equilibria in this game result in zero throughput for all the nodes if they
take myopic best-response, thereby leading to a network collapse. This paper
enables nodes to behave as intelligent entities which can proactively gather
information, form internal conjectures on how their competitors would react to
their actions, and update their beliefs according to their local observations.
In this way, nodes are capable to autonomously ""learn"" the behavior of their
competitors, optimize their own actions, and eventually cultivate reciprocity
in the random access network. To characterize the steady-state outcome, the
conjectural equilibrium is introduced. Inspired by the biological phenomena of
""derivative action"" and ""gradient dynamics"", two distributed conjecture-based
action update mechanisms are proposed to stabilize the random access network.
The sufficient conditions that guarantee the proposed conjecture-based learning
algorithms to converge are derived. Moreover, it is shown that all the
achievable operating points in the throughput region are essentially stable
conjectural equilibria corresponding to different conjectures. We investigate
how the conjectural equilibrium can be selected in heterogeneous networks and
how the proposed methods can be extended to ad-hoc networks. Simulations verify
that the system performance significantly outperforms existing protocols, such
as IEEE 802.11 DCF protocol and the PMAC protocol, in terms of throughput,
fairness, convergence, and stability.

dark matter interacts with the standard model particles via the

observed by ATIC and PAMELA experiments, and more recently by Fermi experiment.
There are three types of $U(1)_{L_i-L_j}$ models: a) $U(1)_{L_e - L_\mu}$, b)
$U(1)_{L_e - L_{\tau}}$, and c) $U(1)_ {L_e-L_\tau}$. Although ATIC or Fermi

correct dark matter relic density and explain the ATIC and PAMELA data
simultaneously recur to the Breit-Wigner enhancement. Whereas model c) with a
larger $Z^\prime$ mass can explain Fermi and PAMELA data simultaneously. In all

self-organization phenomenon of pedestrian dynamics and offers the opportunity

pedestrian streams in corridors, this fundamental relation isn't completely
understood. Specifications of this characteristic in guidelines and text books
differ considerably reflecting the contradictory database and the controversial
discussion documented in the literature. In this contribution it is studied
whether cultural influences and length of the corridor can be the causes for
these deviations. To reduce as much as possible unintentioned effects, a system
is chosen with reduced degrees of freedom and thus the most simple system,
namely the movement of pedestrians along a line under closed boundary
conditions. It is found that the speed of Indian test persons is less dependent
on density than the speed of German test persons. Surprisingly the more
unordered behaviour of the Indians is more effective than the ordered behaviour
of the Germans. Without any statistical measure one cannot conclude about
whether there are differences or not. By hypothesis test it is found
quantitatively that these differences exist, suggesting cultural differences in
the fundamental diagram of pedestrians.

kinematics, and eventually the interactions of the coldest condensations
associated with intermediate-/high-mass star forming regions. The paper studies
the cold condensations in the intermediate-/high-mass proto-cluster IRAS
05345+3157, focusing the attention on the interaction with the other objects in
the cluster. We have performed millimeter high-angular resolution observations,
both in the continuum and several molecular lines, with the PdBI and the SMA.
In a recent paper, we have already published part of these data. The main
finding of that work was the detection of two cold and dense gaseous
condensations, called N and S (masses ~2 and ~9 M_sun), characterised by high
values of the deuterium fractionation (~0.1 in both cores). In this paper, we
present a full report of the observations, and a complete analysis of the data
obtained. The millimeter maps reveal the presence of 3 cores inside the
interferometers primary beam, called C1-a, C1-b and C2. None of them are
associated with cores N and S. C1-b is very likely associated with a newly
formed early-B ZAMS star embedded inside a hot-core, while C1-a is more likely
associated with a class 0 intermediate-mass protostar. The nature of C2 is
unclear. Both C1-a and C1-b are good candidates as driving sources of a
powerful CO outflow, which strongly interacts with N and S, as demonstrated by
the velocity gradient across both condensations. Our major conclusion is that
the chemical properties of these pre-stellar cores are similar to those
observed in low-mass isolated ones, while the kinematics is dominated by the
turbulence triggered by the CO outflow and can influece their evolution.

becomes more and more eccentric and the angular momentum approaches the
critical value for tidal capture. When this value is reached, the body is
suddenly caught by the relativistic potential to the last periastron (occurring
at two Schwarzschild radii for a non rotating black hole). In this process the
transfer of orbital into internal energy heats the body before it makes a few
more turns toward the horizon of the black hole. Because of strong relativistic
effects this last bright message from the object is seen as a quasi-periodic
flare. Assuming that a black hole may be fed by a large number of such small

Earth. This approach begins with a grain scale model of the medium, coarsening
it into a macroscopic one. The emergent model is in good agreement with
previous work, including D. McKenzie's, and serves as verification. This
methodology also yields a series of Stokes problems whose solutions provide
constitutive relations for permeability and viscosity. A numerical
investigation of these relations appears in a companion paper.

light bending and aberration of light produce and enhance flares seen by a

dynamics of two interacting particles in a one-dimensional (1D) billiard is
examined numerically. The 1D walls are modeled by the error function and the
transition from hard to soft walls can be analyzed continuously by varying the
softness parameter $\sigma$. For $\sigma\to 0$ the 1D hard wall limit is
obtained and the corresponding wall force on the particles is the
$\delta$-function. In this limit the interacting particle dynamics agrees with
previous results obtained for the 1D hard walls. We show that the two
interacting particles in the 1D soft walls model is equivalent to one particle
inside a soft right triangular billiard. Very small values of $\sigma$
substantiously change the dynamics inside the billiard and the mean finite-time
Lyapunov exponent decreases significantly as the consequence of regular islands
which appear due to the low-energy double collisions (simultaneous
particle-particle-1D wall collisions). The rise of regular islands and sticky
trajectories induced by the 1D wall softness is quantified by the number of
occurrences of the most probable finite-time Lyapunov exponent. On the other
hand, chaotic motion in the system appears due to the high-energy double
collisions. In general we observe that the mean finite-time Lyapunov exponent
decreases when $\sigma$ increases, but the number of occurrences of the most
probable finite-time Lyapunov exponent increases, meaning that the phase-space
dynamics tends to be more ergodiclike. Our results suggest that the transport
efficiency of interacting particles and heat conduction in periodic structures

logistics, infectious disease control, and counter-terrorism. In the typical
formulation of network interdiction, the task of the interdictor is to find a
set of edges in a weighted network such that the removal of those edges would
maximally increase the cost to an evader of traveling on a path through the
network.
  Our work is motivated by cases in which the evader has incomplete information
about the network or lacks planning time or computational power, e.g. when
authorities set up roadblocks to catch bank robbers, the criminals do not know
all the roadblock locations or the best path to use for their escape.
  We introduce a model of network interdiction in which the motion of one or
more evaders is described by Markov processes and the evaders are assumed not
to react to interdiction decisions. The interdiction objective is to find an
edge set of size B, that maximizes the probability of capturing the evaders.
  We prove that similar to the standard least-cost formulation for
deterministic motion this interdiction problem is also NP-hard. But unlike that
problem our interdiction problem is submodular and the optimal solution can be
approximated within 1-1/e using a greedy algorithm. Additionally, we exploit
submodularity through a priority evaluation strategy that eliminates the linear
complexity scaling in the number of network edges and speeds up the solution by
orders of magnitude. Taken together the results bring closer the goal of
finding realistic solutions to the interdiction problem on global-scale
networks.

in neutral, atomic (HI) gas. We compare the HI line widths predicted from
turbulence driven by supernova (SN) explosions and magneto-rotational
instability (MRI) to direct observations in 11 disk galaxies. We use
high-quality maps of the HI mass surface density and line width, obtained by
the THINGS survey. We show that all sample galaxies exhibit a systematic radial
decline in the HI line width, which appears to be a generic property of HI
disks and also implies a radial decline in kinetic energy density of HI. At a
galactocentric radius of r25 there is a characteristic value of the HI velocity
dispersion of $10\pm2$ \kms. Inside this radius, galaxies show HI line widths
above the thermal value expected from a warm HI component, implying that
turbulence drivers must be responsible for maintaining this line width.
Therefore, we compare maps of HI kinetic energy to maps of the star formation
rate (SFR) and to predictions for energy generated by MRI. We find a positive
correlation between kinetic energy of HI and SFR. For a given turbulence
dissipation timescale we can estimate the energy input required to maintain the
observed kinetic energy. The SN rate implied by the observed recent SFR is
sufficient to maintain the observed velocity dispersion, if the SN feedback
efficiency is at least \epsilon_SN\simeq0.1. Beyond r25, this efficiency would
have to increase to unrealistic values, $\epsilon>1$, suggesting that
mechanical energy from young stars does not supply most energy in outer disks.
On the other hand, both thermal broadening and turbulence driven by MRI can

flux freezing. The magnetic field is compressed and the magnetic pressure
increases until it is able to resist further expansion and the system comes
into approximate magnetostatic equilibrium. Magnetic field lines can be
preferentially aligned perpendicular to the long axis of quiescent cloud before
stars form. After star formation and pushback occurs ionized gas will be
constrained to flow along field lines and escape from the system along
directions perpendicular to the long axis. The magnetic field may play other

transmission problem as a multi-user Markov decision process (MUMDP) by
explicitly considering the users' heterogeneous video traffic characteristics,
time-varying network conditions and the resulting dynamic coupling between the
wireless users. These environment dynamics are often ignored in existing
multi-user video transmission solutions. To comply with the decentralized
nature of wireless networks, we propose to decompose the MUMDP into local MDPs
using Lagrangian relaxation. Unlike in conventional multi-user video
transmission solutions stemming from the network utility maximization
framework, the proposed decomposition enables each wireless user to
individually solve its own dynamic cross-layer optimization (i.e. the local
MDP) and the network coordinator to update the Lagrangian multipliers (i.e.
resource prices) based on not only current, but also future resource needs of
all users, such that the long-term video quality of all users is maximized.
However, solving the MUMDP requires statistical knowledge of the experienced
environment dynamics, which is often unavailable before transmission time. To
overcome this obstacle, we then propose a novel online learning algorithm,
which allows the wireless users to update their policies in multiple states
during one time slot. This is different from conventional learning solutions,
which often update one state per time slot. The proposed learning algorithm can
significantly improve the learning performance, thereby dramatically improving
the video quality experienced by the wireless users over time. Our simulation
results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed MUMDP framework as compared
to conventional multi-user video transmission solutions.

conducting media are derived under the conjugate influence of inertia due to
charge carriers and displacement current. Inertial effects are described by a
relaxation time for the current density in the realm of an extended Ohm's law.
The classical notions of poor and good conductors are rediscussed on the basis
of an effective electric conductivity, depending on both wave frequency and
relaxation time. It is found that the attenuation for good conductors at high
frequencies depends solely on the relaxation time. This means that the
penetration depth saturates to a minimum value at sufficiently high
frequencies. It is also shown that the actions of inertia and displacement
current on damping of magnetic fields are opposite to each other. That could
explain why the classical decay time of magnetic fields scales approximately as
the diffusion time. At very small length scales, the decay time could be given
either by the relaxation time or by a fraction of the diffusion time, depending
whether inertia or displacement current, respectively, would prevail on
magnetic diffusion.

used to study the edge-state equilibration in locally gated graphene devices as

and analytically to see if warps can be excited and sustained in triaxial
potentials. We consider the following two scenarios: 1) galactic disks that are
initially tilted relative to the equatorial plane of the halo (for a
pedagogical purpose), and 2) tilted infall of dark matter relative to the
equatorial plane of the disk and the halo. With numerical simulations of
100,000 disk particles in a fixed halo potential, we find that in triaxial
halos, warps can be excited and sustained just as in spherical or axisymmetric
halos but they show some oscillatory behaviors and even can be transformed to a
polar-ring system if the halo has a prolate-like triaxiality. The
non-axisymmetric component of the halo causes the disk to nutate, and the
differential nutation between the inner and outer parts of the disk generally
makes the magnitude of the warp slightly diminish and fluctuate. We also find
that warps are relatively weaker in oblate and oblate-like triaxial halos, and
since these halos are the halo configurations of disk galaxies inferred by
cosmological simulations, our results are consistent with the fact that most of
the observed warps are quite weak. We derive approximate formulae for the
torques exerted on the disk by the triaxial halo and the dark matter torus, and
with these formulae we successfully describe the behaviors of the disks in our
simulations. The techniques used in deriving these formulae could be applied
for realistic halos with more complex structures.

of dust in the universe. What kind and how much mass of dust are formed in the
ejecta and are injected into the interstellar medium (ISM) depend on the type
of CCSNe, through the difference in the thickness (mass) of outer envelope. In
this review, after summarizing the existing results of observations on dust
formation in CCSNe, we investigate formation of dust in the ejecta and its
evolution in the supernova remnants (SNRs) of Type II--P and Type IIb SNe.
Then, the time evolution of thermal emission from dust in the SNR of Type IIb
SN is demonstrated and compared with the observation of Cas A. We find that the
total dust mass formed in the ejecta does not so much depend on the type; $\sim
0.3-0.7 M_{\odot}$ in Type II--P SNe and $\sim 0.13 M_{\odot}$ in Type IIb SN.
However the size of dust sensitively depends on the type, being affected by the
difference in the gas density in the ejecta: the dust mass is dominated by
grains with radii larger than 0.03 $\mu$m in Type II-P, and less than 0.006
$\mu$m in Type IIb, which decides the fate of dust in the SNR. The surviving
dust mass is $\sim 0.04-0.2 M_{\odot}$ in the SNRs of Type II--P SNe for the
ambient hydrogen density of $n_{\rm H}=10.0-1.0$ cm$^{-3}$, while almost all
dust grains are destroyed in the SNR of Type IIb. The spectral energy
distribution (SED) of thermal emission from dust in SNR well reflects the
evolution of dust grains in SNR through erosion by sputtering and stochastic
heating. The observed SED of Cas A SNR is reasonably reproduced by the model of
dust formation and evolution for Type IIb SN.

2002 August 11, during the impulsive and the long gradual phase. To this end we
obtained multiwavelength observations using the CDS spectrometer aboard SOHO,
facilities at the NSO/Sacramento Peak, and the TRACE and RHESSI spacecrafts.
CDS spectroheliograms in the Fe XIX, Fe XVI, O V and He I lines allows us to
determine the velocity field at different heights/temperatures during the flare
and to compare them with the chromospheric velocity fields deduced from H alpha
image differences. TRACE images in the 17.1 nm band greatly help in determining
the morphology and the evolution of the flaring structures. During the
impulsive phase a strong blue-shifted Fe XIX component (-200 km/s) is observed
at the footpoints of the flaring loop system, together with a red-shifted
emission of O V and He I lines (20 km/s). In one footpoint simultaneous H alpha
data are also available and we find, at the same time and location, downflows
with an inferred velocity between 4 and 10 km/s. We also verify that the
""instantaneous"" momenta of the oppositely directed flows detected in Fe XIX and
H alpha are equal within one order of magnitude. These signatures are in
general agreement with the scenario of explosive chromospheric evaporation.
Combining RHESSI and CDS data after the coronal upflows have ceased, we prove
that, independently from the filling factor, an essential contribution to the
density of the post-flare loop system is supplied from evaporated chromospheric
material. Finally, we consider the cooling of this loop system, that becomes
successively visible in progressively colder signatures during the gradual
phase. We show that the observed cooling behaviour can be obtained assuming a
coronal filling factor between 0.2 and 0.5.

merging limit. We show that the ratio J/M^2 for extremal co-rotating Kerr black

These results are interpreted in terms of rotational dragging and compared with
the case of counter-rotating Kerr black holes. We then analyse the merging of
ergo-regions. In the co-rotating case the merger point occurs at an angle of
\pi/2, in agreement with recent general arguments. In the counter-rotating case
the ergo-regions never merge. We study the horizon geometry for both cases as a
function of the distance and provide embedding diagrams. Finally, we study the
thermodynamical evolution of the co-rotating double Kerr system, showing that,
in the canonical ensemble, it is thermodynamically stable for fast spinning
black holes. As for single Kerr black holes the stable and unstable phases are
separated by a second order phase transition. We show that for large fixed
angular momentum two Kerr black holes reach a minimum distance, before horizon
merging has occurred, where the thermodynamical approximation breaks down. We
also consider the micro-canonical ensemble to study the maximal energy that can

matter halo depend on the large-scale environment surrounding the halo. As a
result of this correlation, we expect massive haloes to be present in larger
number in overdense regions than in underdense ones. Given that a correlation
exists between a galaxy stellar mass and the hosting dark matter halo mass, the
segregation in dark matter halo mass should then result in a segregation in the
distribution of stellar mass in the galaxy population. In this work we study
the distribution of galaxy stellar mass and rest-frame optical color as a
function of the large-scale galaxy distribution using the VLT VIMOS Deep Survey
sample, in order to verify the presence of segregation in the properties of the
galaxy population. We use the VVDS redshift measurements and multi-band
photometric data to derive estimates of the stellar mass, rest-frame optical
color, and of the large-scale galaxy density, on a scale of approximately 8
Mpc, for a sample of 5619 galaxies in the redshift range 0.2<z<1.4. We observe
a significant mass and optical color segregation over the whole redshift
interval covered by our sample, such that the median value of the mass
distribution is larger and the rest-frame optical color is redder in regions of
high galaxy density. The amplitude of the mass segregation changes little with
redshift, at least in the high stellar mass regime that we can uniformely
sample over the 0.2<z<1.4 redshift interval. The color segregation, instead,
decreases significantly for z>0.7. However, when we consider only galaxies in
narrow bins of stellar mass, in order to exclude the effects of the stellar
mass segregation on the galaxy properties, we do not observe any more any
significant color segregation.

many solar, stellar, magnetospheric and astrophysical phenomena has long been
recognised. Reconnection is the only mechanism by which magnetic fields can
globally restructure, enabling them to access a lower energy state. Over the
past decade, there have been some major advances in our understanding of
three-dimensional reconnection. In particular, the key characteristics of 3D
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) reconnection have been determined. For instance, 3D
reconnection (i) occurs with or without nulls, (ii) occurs continuously and
continually throughout a diffusion region and (iii) is driven by counter
rotating flows.
  Furthermore, analysis of resistive 3D MHD magnetic experiments have revealed
some intriguing effects relating to where and how reconnection occurs. To
illustrate these new features, a series of constant-resistivity experiments,
involving the interaction of two opposite-polarity magnetic sources in an
overlying field, are considered. Such a simple interaction represents a typical
building block of the Sun's magnetic atmosphere. By following the evolution of
the magnetic topology, we are able to explain where, how and at what rate the
reconnection occurs. Remarkably there can be up to five energy release sites at
anyone time (compared to one in the potential case) and the duration of the
interaction increases (more than doubles) as the resistivity decreases (by a
factor of 16). The decreased resistivity also leads to a higher peak ohmic
dissipation and more energy being released in total, as a result of a greater
injection of Poynting flux.

interarrival times and document sizes to be generally distributed, rather than

document sizes of all flows through the network. We propose a fluid model (or

stochastic flow level model. Under mild conditions, we show that the
appropriately rescaled measure valued processes corresponding to a sequence of

2D SO(3) quantum Heisenberg model, on a square lattice, with nearest neighbors
interaction, by taking a Gaussian random distribution of couplings centered in
an antiferromagnetic coupling, $\bar J>0$ and with a width $\Delta J$. Using
coherent spin states we can integrate over the random variables and map the
system onto a field theory, which is a generalization of the SO(3) nonlinear
sigma model with different flavors corresponding to the replicas, coupling
parameter proportional to $\bar J$ and having a quartic spin interaction
proportional to the disorder ($\Delta J$). After deriving the CP$^1$ version of
the system, we perform a calculation of the free energy density in the limit of
zero replicas, which fully includes the quantum fluctuations of the CP$^1$
fields $z_i$. We, thereby obtain the phase diagram of the system in terms of
($T, \bar J, \Delta J$). This presents an ordered antiferromagnetic (AF) phase,
a paramagnetic (PM) phase and a spin-glass (SG) phase. A critical curve
separating the PM and SG phases ends at a quantum critical point located
between the AF and SG phases, at T=0. The Edwards-Anderson order parameter, as
well as the magnetic susceptibilities are explicitly obtained in each of the
three phases as a function of the three control parameters. The magnetic
susceptibilities show a Curie-type behavior at high temperatures and exhibit a
clear cusp, characteristic of the SG transition, at the transition line. The
thermodynamic stability of the phases is investigated by a careful analysis of
the Hessian matrix of the free energy. We show that all principal minors of the
Hessian are positive in the limit of zero replicas, implying in particular that
the SG phase is stable.

  Part I: Maps and flows in finite dimensions","To appear in JDE",,,,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present theorems which provide the existence of invariant whiskered tori
in finite-dimensional exact symplectic maps and flows. The method is based on
the study of a functional equation expressing that there is an invariant torus.
  We show that, given an approximate solution of the invariance equation which
satisfies some non-degeneracy conditions, there is a true solution nearby. We
call this an {\sl a posteriori} approach.
  The proof of the main theorems is based on an iterative method to solve the
functional equation.
  The theorems do not assume that the system is close to integrable nor that it
is written in action-angle variables (hence we can deal in a unified way with
primary and secondary tori). It also does not assume that the hyperbolic
bundles are trivial and much less that the hyperbolic motion can be reduced to
constant.
  The a posteriori formulation allows us to justify approximate solutions
produced by many non-rigorous methods (e.g. formal series expansions, numerical
methods). The iterative method is not based on transformation theory, but
rather on succesive corrections. This makes it possible to adapt the method
almost verbatim to several infinite-dimensional situations, which we will
discuss in a forthcoming paper. We also note that the method leads to fast and
efficient algorithms. We plan to develop these improvements in forthcoming
papers.

to the case of motility assay experiments where motors bound to a surface push
on a bundle of filaments. We find that, depending on the absence or the

exhibits anomalous or biased diffusion on long-time and large-length scales.

molecular gas in the central 320pc of NGC1097. The stellar continuum confirms
the previously reported 3-arm spiral pattern extending into the central 100pc.
The stellar kinematics and the gas distribution imply this is a shadowing
effect due to extinction by gas and dust in the molecular spiral arms. The
molecular gas kinematics show a strong residual (i.e. non-circular) velocity,
which is manifested as a 2-arm kinematic spiral. Linear models indicate that
this is the line-of-sight velocity pattern expected for a density wave in gas
that generates a 3-arm spiral morphology. We estimate the inflow rate along the
arms. Using hydrodynamical models of nuclear spirals, we show that when
deriving the accretion rate into the central region, outflow in the disk plane
between the arms has to be taken into account. For NGC1097, despite the inflow
rate along the arms being ~1.2Msun/yr, the net gas accretion rate to the
central few tens of parsecs is much smaller. The numerical models indicate that
the inflow rate could be as little as ~0.06Msun/yr. This is sufficient to
generate recurring starbursts, similar in scale to that observed, every
20-150Myr. The nuclear spiral represents a mechanism that can feed gas into the
central parsecs of the galaxy, with the gas flow sustainable for timescales of
a Gigayear.

and the basic coupling construction is a usual route to prove this property, as
for instance in simple exclusion. The derived Markovian coupled process

(coordinate-wise), then for all $t\geq 0$, $\xi_t\leq\zeta_t$ a.s. In this
paper, we consider generalized misanthrope models which are conservative
particle systems on $\Z^d$ such that, in each transition, $k$ particles may
jump from a site $x$ to another site $y$, with $k\geq 1$. These models include
simple exclusion for which $k=1$, but, beyond that value, the basic coupling
construction is not possible and a more refined one is required. We give
necessary and sufficient conditions on the rates to insure attractiveness; we
construct a Markovian coupled process which both satisfies (A) and makes
discrepancies between its two marginals non-increasing. We determine the
extremal invariant and translation invariant probability measures under general
irreducibility conditions. We apply our results to examples including a
two-species asymmetric exclusion process with charge conservation (for which
$k\le 2$) which arises from a Solid-on-Solid interface dynamics, and a stick
process (for which $k$ is unbounded) in correspondence with a generalized
discrete Hammersley-Aldous-Diaconis model. We derive the hydrodynamic limit of
