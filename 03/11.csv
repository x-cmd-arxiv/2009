coupled to a high-finesse optical cavity. An effective direct coupling between
cavity and nuclear spins is obtained by adiabatically eliminating the (far
detuned) excitonic and electronic states. The requirements needed to map qubit
and continuous variable states of cavity or traveling-wave fields to the
collective nuclear spin are investigated: For cavity fields, we consider
adiabatic passage processes to transfer the states. It is seen that a
significant improvement in cavity lifetimes beyond present-day technology would
be required for a quantum interface. We then turn to a scheme which couples the
nuclei to the output field of the cavity and can tolerate significantly shorter
cavity lifetimes. We show that the lifetimes reported in the literature and the
recently achieved nuclear polarization of ~90% allow both high-fidelity
read-out and write-in of quantum information between the nuclear spins and the
output field. We discuss the performance of the scheme and provide a convenient
description of the dipolar dynamics of the nuclei for highly polarized spins,
demonstrating that this process does not affect the performance of our

sufficiently large volumes. Decoherence arises directly from the proximity of
these variables to exactly conserved quantities (which are exactly decoherent),
and not from environmentally-induced decoherence. We discuss the approach to
local equilibrium and the subsequent emergence of hydrodynamic equations for
the local densities. The results are general but we focus on a chain of
oscillators as a specific example in which explicit calculations may be carried
out. We discuss the relationships between environmentally-induced and
conservation-induced decoherence and present a unified view of these two

cores depends strongly on the initial density profile. Prolate cores with
central densities 20 times higher than their boundary densities collapse and
fragment into binary or quadruple systems, whereas cores with central densities
100 times higher collapse to form single protostars embedded in bars. The
inclusion of magnetic braking is able to stifle protostellar fragmentation in
the latter set of models, as when identical models were calculated without
magnetic braking (Boss 2002), those cores fragmented into binary protostars.
These models demonstrate the importance of including magnetic fields in studies
of protostellar collapse and fragmentation, and suggest that even when magnetic
fields are included, fragmentation into binary and multiple systems remains as
a possible outcome of protostellar collapse.

second step, we examine interfaces between two arbitrary transformation media.
This analysis is extended to the recently suggested generalization of
transformation optics by the author. As a basic application it is shown how the
standard law of reflection and refraction at an interface between vacuum and a
homogeneous and isotropic medium with arbitrary and independent permittivity

scattering for a long time at each necessity case a particular, ad hoc
reception were used. However the desirability of general approach basing on
concepts of quantum field theory and uniting two main problems, durations of
delay at scattering and of formation of arisen states, seems evident.
  We show that the Ward-Takahashi identity allows the defining of general
temporal function in the frame of QED, real part of which describes the
duration of delay of scattered particle on scatterer and imaginary part
describes the duration of formation (""dressing"") of outgoing bare particle. The
functions of same form can be revealed in the known QED descriptions of
processes, i.e. they arise in the course of standard calculations, but are not
entered artificially. These functions submit to the operator of duration
determinable by the reciprocal analogue of the Schroedinger equation, operator
of which is canonically conjugated with Hamiltonian. Definition of temporal
functions leads to the developing of such kinetic theories: theory of optical
dispersion (with the decision of certain known paradoxes), theory of
multiphoton processes (definitions of their thresholds and saturations) and
theory of phase transitions (determination of general correlation radii and the
full system of critical indices). The determination of temporal functions
demonstrates also the instanton-type nature of tunneling processes, makes clear
sense of the adiabatic hypothesis of quantum theory and some renormalization
schemes. In an application to the problem of charge nullification they lead to
a restriction of allowable number of fermions of the theory.

curves obtained by the CoRoT satellite in its planet finding channel, with a
particular emphasis on the timescales characteristic of planetary transits.
Together with other articles in the same issue of this journal, it forms an
attempt to provide the building blocks for a statistical interpretation of the
CoRoT planet and eclipsing binary catch to date.
  After pre-processing the light curves so as to minimise long-term variations
and outliers, we measure the scatter of the light curves in the first three
CoRoT runs lasting more than 1 month, using an iterative non-linear filter to
isolate signal on the timescales of interest. The bevhaiour of the noise on 2h
timescales is well-described a power-law with index 0.25 in R-magnitude,
ranging from 0.1mmag at R=11.5 to 1mmag at R=16, which is close to the
pre-launch specification, though still a factor 2-3 above the photon noise due
to residual jitter noise and hot pixel events. There is evidence for a slight
degradation of the performance over time. We find clear evidence for enhanced
variability on hours timescales (at the level of 0.5 mmag) in stars identified
as likely giants from their R-magnitude and B-V colour, which represent
approximately 60 and 20% of the observed population in the direction of Aquila
and Monoceros respectively. On the other hand, median correlated noise levels
over 2h for dwarf stars are extremely low, reaching 0.05mmag at the bright end.

characterized by convergence at asymptotically deterministic times, while the
convergence times for the latter are exponentially distributed. We compare and

towards zero. In particular, this includes energy-driven evolutions with energy
functions in the form of a single well. Under suitable drift hypotheses, we
show that there is both an abrupt convergence towards zero and escape behavior
in the other direction. Furthermore, as the evolutions are reversible, the law
of the final escape trajectory coincides with the time reverse of the law of
cut-off paths. Thus, for evolutions defined by one-dimensional energy wells
with sufficiently steep walls, cut-off and escape behavior are related by time
inversion.

on sparse graphs, namely low-density generator-matrix and low-density
parity-check codes. The optimal (or ideal) decoder based on the posterior
measure over the code bits, and its relationship to the sub-optimal belief
propagation decoder, are investigated. We consider the correlation (or
covariance) between two codebits, averaged over the noise realizations, as a
function of the graph distance, for the optimal decoder. Our main result is
that this correlation decays exponentially fast for fixed general low-density
generator-matrix codes and high enough noise parameter, and also for fixed
general low-density parity-check codes and low enough noise parameter. This has
many consequences. Appropriate performance curves - called GEXIT functions - of
the belief propagation and optimal decoders match in high/low noise regimes.
This means that in high/low noise regimes the performance curves of the optimal
decoder can be computed by density evolution. Another interpretation is that
the replica predictions of spin-glass theory are exact. Our methods are rather
general and use cluster expansions first developed in the context of
mathematical statistical mechanics.

moving away from the Galactic center with a velocity of 396 km/s, which is very

was one of the first planets discovered by CoRoT. Analysis of the pipeline
reduced CoRoT light curve yields a new determination of the physical and
orbital parameters of planet and star, along with 35 individual transit times
at a typical precision of 36 s. I estimate a planet-to-star radii ratio of
0.1433 +/- 0.0010, a ratio of the planet's orbital semimajor axis to the host
star radius of 4.751 +/- 0.045, and an orbital inclination for the planet of
83.88 +/- 0.29 deg. The observed transit times are consistent with CoRoT-1b
having a constant period and there is no evidence of an additional planet in
the system. I use the observed constancy of the transit times to set limits on
the mass of a hypothetical additional planet in a nearby, stable orbit. I
ascertain that the most stringent limits (4 M_earth at 3 sigma confidence) can
be placed on planets residing in a 1:2 mean motion resonance with the
transiting planet. In contrast, the data yield less stringent limits on planets
near a 1:3 mean motion resonance (5 M_jup at 3 sigma confidence) than in the
surrounding parameter space. In addition, I use a simulation to investigate
what sensitivity to additional planets could be obtained from the analysis of
data measured for a similar system during a CoRoT long run (100 sequential
transit times). I find that for such a scenario, planets with masses greater
than twice that of Mars (0.2 M_earth) in the 1:2 mean motion resonance would
cause high-significance transit time deviations. Therefore, such planets could
be detected or ruled out using CoRoT long run data. I conclude that CoRoT data

Galactic disk, excite spiral structure and a warp and induce streams in the
velocity distribution. We examine particle eccentricity versus the change in
mean radius between initial and current orbits. Correlations between these
quantities are reduced after a few satellite pericenter passages. Stars born in
the outer galaxy can be moved in radius from their birth positions and be
placed in low eccentricity orbits inside their birth radii. We propose that
mergers and perturbations from satellite galaxies and subhalos can induce
radial mixing in the stellar metallicity distribution.

qPATHINT, has been developed from classical PATHINT. Both fold short-time
propagators (distributions or wave functions) over long times. Previous papers
applied qPATHINT to two systems, in neocortical interactions and financial
options. \textbf{Objective}: In this paper the quantum path-integral for
Calcium ions is used to derive a closed-form analytic solution at arbitrary
time that is used to calculate interactions with classical-physics SMNI
interactions among scales. Using fits of this SMNI model to EEG data, including
these effects, will help determine if this is a reasonable approach.
\textbf{Method}: Methods of mathematical-physics for optimization and for path
integrals in classical and quantum spaces are used for this project. Studies
using supercomputer resources tested various dimensions for their scaling
limits. In this paper the quantum path-integral is used to derive a closed-form
analytic solution at arbitrary time that is used to calculate interactions with
classical-physics SMNI interactions among scales. \textbf{Results}: The
mathematical-physics and computer parts of the study are successful, in that
there is modest improvement of cost/objective functions used to fit EEG data

more detailed calculations using more EEG data and qPATHINT at each time slice

quantities in the theory, the notion of time has to be introduced
""relationally"", by studying the behavior of some physical quantities in terms
of others chosen as a ""clock"". We have recently introduced a consistent way of
defining time relationally in general relativity. When quantum mechanics is
formulated in terms of this new notion of time the resolution of the
measurement problem can be implemented via decoherence without the usual
pitfalls. The resulting theory has the same experimental results of ordinary
quantum mechanics, but every time an event is produced or a measurement happens
two alternatives are possible: a) the state collapses; b) the system evolves
without changing the state. One therefore has two possible behaviors of the
quantum mechanical system and physical observations cannot decide between them,
not just as a matter of experimental limitations but as an issue of principle.
This first-ever example of fundamental undecidability in physics suggests that
nature may behave sometimes as described by one alternative and sometimes as
described by another. This in particular may give new vistas on the issue of
free will.

re-pointing, similar to that on board of the recently proposed X-ray satellites
EDGE and XENIA. For this purpose we have analyzed mock absorption spectra
extracted from different hydrodynamical simulations used to model the
properties of the Warm Hot Intergalactic Medium [WHIM]. These models predict
the correct abundance of OVI absorption lines observed in UV and satisfy
current X-ray constraints. According to these models space missions like EDGE
and XENIA should be able to detect about 60 WHIM absorbers per year through the
OVII line. About 45 % of these have at least two more detectable lines in
addition to OVII that can be used to determine the density and the temperature
of the gas. Systematic errors in the estimates of the gas density and
temperature can be corrected for in a robust, largely model-independent
fashion. The analysis of the GRB absorption spectra collected in three years
would also allow to measure the cosmic mass density of the WHIM with about 15 %
accuracy, although this estimate depends on the WHIM model. Our results suggest
that GRBs represent a valid, if not preferable, alternative to Active Galactic
Nuclei to study the WHIM in absorption. The analysis of the absorption spectra
nicely complements the study of the WHIM in emission that the spectrometer
proposed for EDGE and XENIA would be able to carry out thanks to its high
sensitivity and large field of view.

The very high column density ($N_H \sim 6 \times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$) implies
that dust scattering is important, and we use a simple scattering model in our
spectral analysis. The integrated X-ray spectrum of G1.9+0.3 is well described
by synchrotron emission from a power-law electron distribution with an
exponential cutoff. Using our measured radio flux and including scattering
effects, we find a rolloff frequency of $5.4 (3.0, 10.2) \times 10^{17}$ Hz ($h
\nu_{\rm roll} = 2.2$ keV). Including scattering in a two-region model gives
lower values of \nu_roll by over a factor of 2. Dividing G1.9+0.3 into six
regions, we find a systematic pattern in which spectra are hardest (highest
\nu_roll) in the bright SE and NW limbs of the shell. They steepen as one moves
around the shell or into the interior. The extensions beyond the bright parts
of the shell have the hardest spectra of all. We interpret the results in terms
of dependence of shock acceleration properties on the obliquity angle
$\theta_{\rm Bn}$ between the shock velocity and a fairly uniform upstream
magnetic field. This interpretation probably requires a Type Ia event. If
electron acceleration is limited by synchrotron losses, the spectral variations
require obliquity-dependence of the acceleration rate independent of the

objects observed and 63 detected, SINS is the largest survey of spatially
resolved gas kinematics, morphologies, and physical properties of star-forming

rest-UV/optically-selected sources at 1.3<z<2.6 for which we targeted primarily
the Halpha and [NII] emission lines. Only 30% of this sample had previous
near-IR spectroscopic observations. As a whole, the SINS Halpha sample covers a
reasonable representation of massive log(M*/Msun)>~10 star-forming galaxies at
z~1.5-2.5, with some bias towards bluer systems compared to pure K-selected
samples due to the requirement of secure optical redshift. The sample spans two
orders of magnitude in stellar mass and in absolute and specific star formation
rates, with median values of approximately log(M*/Msun) = 10.5, 70 Msun/yr, and
3/Gyr. The ionized gas distribution and kinematics are spatially resolved on
scales ranging from 1.5 kpc for adaptive optics assisted observations to
typically 4-5 kpc for seeing-limited data. The Halpha morphologies tend to be
irregular and/or clumpy. About one-third are rotation-dominated yet turbulent
disks, another third comprises compact and velocity dispersion-dominated
objects, and the remaining galaxies are clear interacting/merging systems; the
fraction of rotation-dominated systems increases among the more massive part of
the sample. The Halpha luminosities and equivalent widths suggest on average
roughly twice higher dust attenuation towards the HII regions relative to the
bulk of the stars, and comparable current and past-averaged star formation
rates. [Abridged]

(< 0.1 mJy) of a bare photosphere, and the 3 sigma upper limit at 16 um is a
mere 0.04 mJy above the bare photospheric level. Together with the known
properties of the system, this implies the absence of optically thick disks
around the individual components. It also implies that if any circumbinary disk
is present, it must either be optically thin and extremely tenuous (10^{-10}
Msun) if it extends in to within ~0.1 AU of the binary (the approximate tidal
truncation radius), or it must be optically thick with a large inner hole, >
0.6-10 AU in radius depending on degree of flaring. The consequence in all
cases is that disk accretion is likely to be negligible or absent. This
supports the recent proposal that the strong Halpha emission in the primary
(more massive) brown dwarf results from chromospheric activity, and thereby
bolsters the hypothesis that the surprising Teff inversion observed between the
components is due to strong magnetic fields on the primary. Our data also set
constraints on the Teff of the components independent of spectral type, and
thereby on models of the aforementioned magnetic field effects. We discuss the

of solutions and find that the temperature region in which the Hopfield
attractor is stable increases as the learning coefficient increases.
Theoretical results are confirmed by the direct numerical integration of the
Langevin equation. Further, we study the characteristics of the resultant
synaptic interactions by partial annealing and find that the stability of the
attractor which emerges after partial annealing is enhanced and those of the
coexistent attractors are reduced.

independent LEET parameters \zeta_\perp and \zeta_\parallel. The magnitude of
\zeta_\perp is estimated from the data for Br(B \to K_2^*(1430)\gamma).
Assuming a dipole q^2-dependence for the LEET parameters and

K_2^* \ell^+ \ell^- and B \to K_2^* \nu \bar{\nu}, where the contributions due
to $\zeta_\parallel are suppressed by m_{K_2^*}/m_B. For the B \to K_2^* \ell^+
\ell^- decay, in the large recoil region where the hadronic uncertainties are
considerably reduced, the longitudinal distribution d F_L/ds is reduced by
20-30 % due to the flipped sign of c_7^eff compared with the standard model
result. Moreover, the forward-backward asymmetry zero is about 3.4 GeV^2 in the
standard model, but changing the sign of c_7^eff yields a positive asymmetry
for all values of the invariant mass of the lepton pair. We calculate the
branching fraction for B \to K_2^* \nu \bar{\nu} in the standard model. Our

We write this action in terms of the physical transverse fluctuations of the

action must exactly match the ones in the Nambu-Goto action, generalizing a
result of Luscher and Weisz for D=3. We then analyze the six-derivative terms,
and we show that some of these terms are constrained. For D=3 this uniquely
determines the effective action for closed strings to this order, while for D>3
one term is not uniquely determined by our considerations. This implies that
for D=3 the energy levels of a closed string of length L agree with the
Nambu-Goto result at least up to order 1/L^5. For any D we find that the
partition function of a long string on a torus is unaffected by the free
coefficient, so it is always equal to the Nambu-Goto partition function up to
six-derivative order. For a closed string of length L, this means that for D>3
its energy can, in principle, deviate from the Nambu-Goto result at order
1/L^5, but such deviations must always cancel in the computation of the
partition function. Next, we compute the effective action up to six-derivative
order for the special case of confining strings in weakly-curved holographic
backgrounds, at one-loop order (leading order in the curvature). Our
computation is general, and applies in particular to backgrounds like the
Witten background, the Maldacena-Nunez background, and the Klebanov-Strassler

distance to a critical volume fraction phi_0 which is much larger than the

glass-formers in the activated regime. We compare these results to previous

that phi_0 corresponds to an ideal glass transition. We use non-equilibrium

between D(APE), the dissipation rate of available potential energy APE, and
W_{r,turbulent}, the turbulent rate of change of background gravitational
potential energy GPE_r, which are both controlled by molecular diffusion. For
Boussinesq fluids with a linear equation of state, this link is simply
W_{r,turbulent}=D(APE), widely interpreted as implying that GPE_r increases at
the expense of APE, in contrast with the laminar case where GPE_r increases at
the expense of internal energy (IE). This idea is revisited here by regarding
IE as the sum of three distinct subcomponents: available internal energy (AIE),
exergy (IE_{exergy}), and dead internal energy (IE_0). In this new view, D(APE)
is the dissipation rate of APE into IE_0, while both W_{r,laminar} and
W_{r,turbulent} convert IE_{exergy} into GPE_r. The equality
W_{r,turbulent}=D(APE) thus states that IE_{exergy} is converted into GPE_r at
the same rate as APE is dissipated into IE_0. For non-Boussinesq fluids, the
equality D(APE)=W_{r,turbulent} is at best a good approximation, for
W_{r,turbulent} is generally smaller than D(APE), and sometimes even negative
for a strongly nonlinear equation of state. In a second step, the link between
stirring and mixing is examined for a wind-and buoyancy-driven thermally
stratified ocean to determine whether these constrain the mechanical sources of
stirring, as recently advocated. It is established that the coupling between
stirring and mixing cannot refute the traditional buoyancy-driven view of the
so-called meridional overturning circulation, in contrast to recent claims. In
fact, the buoyancy forcing appears to be as important as the mechanical forcing
in stirring and driving the large-scale ocean circulation.

diagonalization of the charged lepton masses, we construct a model based on the
discrete group S4 where those properties are naturally realized. The model is
supersymmetric in 4-dimensions and the complete flavour group is S4 x Z4 x
U(1)_FN, which also allows to reproduce the hierarchy of the charged lepton
spectrum. The only fine tuning needed in the model is to reproduce the small
observed value of r, the ratio between the neutrino mass squared differences.
Once the relevant parameters are set to accommodate r then the spectrum of
light neutrinos shows a moderate normal hierarchy and is compatible, within
large ambiguities, with the constraints from leptogenesis as an explanation of
the baryon asymmetry in the Universe.

(2008), pp. 129-177), we have rigorously derived, by means of bulk limit
arguments, a new variational model to describe the electronic ground state of
insulating or semiconducting crystals in the presence of local defects. In this
so-called reduced Hartree-Fock model, the ground state electronic density
matrix is decomposed as $\gamma = \gamma^0_{\rm per} + Q_{\nu,\epsilon_{\rm
F}}$, where $\gamma^0_{\rm per}$ is the ground state density matrix of the host
crystal and $Q_{\nu,\epsilon_{\rm F}}$ the modification of the electronic
density matrix generated by a modification $\nu$ of the nuclear charge of the
host crystal, the Fermi level $\epsilon_{\rm F}$ being kept fixed. The purpose
of the present article is twofold. First, we study more in details the
mathematical properties of the density matrix $Q_{\nu,\epsilon_{\rm F}}$ (which
is known to be a self-adjoint Hilbert-Schmidt operator on $L^2(\R^3)$). We show
in particular that if $\int_{\RR^3} \nu \neq 0$, $Q_{\nu,\epsilon_{\rm F}}$ is
not trace-class. Moreover, the associated density of charge is not in
$L^1(\R^3)$ if the crystal exhibits anisotropic dielectric properties. These
results are obtained by analyzing, for a small defect $\nu$, the linear and
nonlinear terms of the resolvent expansion of $Q_{\nu,\epsilon_{\rm F}}$.
Second, we show that, after an appropriate rescaling, the potential generated
by the microscopic total charge (nuclear plus electronic contributions) of the
crystal in the presence of the defect, converges to a homogenized electrostatic
potential solution to a Poisson equation involving the macroscopic dielectric
permittivity of the crystal. This provides an alternative (and rigorous)
derivation of the Adler-Wiser formula.

high-temperature extension of those of the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds.
This implies that the optical properties of dust in BCDs are similar to those
in the Milky Way. Indeed, we explain the FIR colours by assuming the same grain
optical properties, which may be appropriate for amorphous dust grains, and the
same size distribution as those adopted for the Milky Way dust. Since both
interstellar radiation field and dust optical depth affect the dust
temperature, it is difficult to distinguish which of these two physical
properties is responsible for the change of FIR colours. Then, in order to
examine if the dust optical depth plays an important role in determining the
dust temperature, we investigate the correlation between FIR colour (dust
temperature) and dust-to-gas ratio. We find that the dust temperature tends to
be high as the dust-to-gas ratio decreases but that this trend cannot be
explained by the effect of dust optical depth. Rather, it indicates a
correlation between dust-to-gas ratio and interstellar radiation field.
Although the metallicity may also play a role in this correlation, we suggest
that the dust optical depth could regulate the star formation activities, which
govern the interstellar radiation field. We also mention the importance of
submillimetre data in tracing the emission from highly shielded low-temperature

detected. When considering the Li distribution as a function of mass, however,
Be 32 members with solar-like temperature are less massive and less Li-depleted
than their counterparts in the other clusters. The mean Li of stars in the
temperature interval 5750 < Teff < 6050 K is log n(Li)=2.47 +/- 0.16, less than

classical arrival time problem involving an absorbing potential, and this sheds
some light on certain aspects of the quantum case. In the quantum case, we
review the path decomposition expansion (PDX), in which the propagator is
factored across a surface of constant time, so is very useful for potentials of
step function form. We use the PDX to derive the usual scattering wave
functions and the arrival time distribution function. This method gives a
direct and geometrically appealing account of known results (but also points
the way to how they can be extended to more general complex potentials). We use
these results to carry out a decoherent histories analysis of the arrival time
problem, taking advantage of a recently demonstrated connection between pulsed
measurements and complex potentials. We obtain very simple and plausible
expressions for the class operators (describing the amplitudes for crossing the
origin during intervals of time) and show that decoherence of histories is
obtained for a wide class of initial states (such as simple wave packets and
superpositions of wave packets). We find that the decoherent histories approach

frequently emerges as the probability for crossing the origin during a given
time interval is the current integrated over that time interval. This is
semiclassically correct but can be negative due to backflow. Here, we show that
this formula naturally arises in a decoherent histories analysis of the arrival
time problem. For a variety of initial states, we show that histories crossing
during different time intervals are approximately decoherent. Probabilities may
therefore be assigned and coincide with the standard formula (in a
semiclassical approximation), which is therefore positive for these states.
However, for initial states for which there is backflow, we show that there
cannot be decoherence of histories, so probabilities may not be assigned.

distribution of material are calculated numerically. It is proved that the
gravity field of mass thin disc distribution is greatly different from that of
spherically symmetrical distribution. As long as the Newtonian theory of
gravity is used strictly, by the proper mass distributions of thin discs, the
flat rotation curves of whirlpool galaxies can be explained well. The rotating
curve of the Milky Galaxy is obtained which coincides with practical
observation. In this way, it is unnecessary for us to suppose the existence of
additional dark material in the illuminant discs of whirlpool galaxy again.
Meanwhile, in the space outside the illuminant disc, the quantity of dark
material needed to maintain the flatness of rotation curves is greatly
decreased. By considering the observation fact that the quantity of
non-luminous baryon material is 3~10 times more than luminous material, we can
explain the flatness of rotation curves of whirlpool galaxies well without the
hypotheses of non-baryon dark material. So it is unnecessary for us to suppose
that non-baryon dark material is about 5 times more than baryon material in a
single whirlpool galaxy, no mater whether non-baryon dark material exits or
not.

self-sustained activity in autonomously active recurrent neural nets and
external sensory stimuli.
  There is no a priori semantical relation between the influx of external
stimuli and the patterns generated internally by the autonomous and ongoing
brain dynamics. The question then arises when and how are semantic correlations
between internal and external dynamical processes learned and built up?
  We study this problem within the paradigm of transient state dynamics for the
neural activity in recurrent neural nets, i.e. for an autonomous neural
activity characterized by an infinite time-series of transiently stable
attractor states. We propose that external stimuli will be relevant during the
sensitive periods, {\it viz} the transition period between one transient state
and the subsequent semi-stable attractor. A diffusive learning signal is
generated unsupervised whenever the stimulus influences the internal dynamics
qualitatively.
  For testing we have presented to the model system stimuli corresponding to
the bars and stripes problem. We found that the system performs a non-linear
independent component analysis on its own, being continuously and autonomously
active. This emergent cognitive capability results here from a general
principle for the neural dynamics, the competition between neural ensembles.

We refine the phase diagram for this model where three distinct phases are
known to exist: a uniformly ordered phase, a disordered phase, and a
non-uniform ordered phase where the spatial SO(3) symmetry of the round sphere
is spontaneously broken and which has no classical equivalent. The three
coexistence lines between these phases, which meet at a triple point, are
carefully located with particular attention paid to the one between the two
ordered phases and the triple point itself. In the neighbourhood of the triple
point all phase boundaries are well approximated by straight lines which,
surprisingly, have the same scaling. We argue that unless an additional term is
added to enhance the effect of the kinetic term the infinite matrix limit of
this model will not correspond to a real scalar field on the commutative sphere

$T_L$ for disordered samples of linear size $L$ is expected to be multifractal
with the following properties [Janssen {\it et al} PRB 59, 15836 (1999)] : (i)
the probability to have $T_L \sim 1/L^{\kappa}$ behaves as $L^{\Phi(\kappa)}$,
where the multifractal spectrum $\Phi(\kappa)$ terminates at $\kappa=0$ as a
consequence of the physical bound $T_L \leq 1$; (ii) the exponents $X(q)$ that
govern the moments $\overline{T_L^q} \sim 1/L^{X(q)}$ become frozen above some
threshold: $X(q \geq q_{sat}) = - \Phi(\kappa=0)$, i.e. all moments of order $q
\geq q_{sat}$ are governed by the measure of the rare samples having a finite
transmission ($\kappa=0$). In the present paper, we test numerically these
predictions for the ensemble of $L \times L$ power-law random banded matrices,
where the random hopping $H_{i,j}$ decays as a power-law $(b/| i-j |)^a$. This
model is known to present an Anderson transition at $a=1$ between localized
($a>1$) and extended ($a<1$) states, with critical properties that depend
continuously on the parameter $b$. Our numerical results for the multifractal
spectra $\Phi_b(\kappa)$ for various $b$ are in agreement with the relation
$\Phi(\kappa \geq 0) = 2 [ f(\alpha= d+ \frac{\kappa}{2}) -d ]$ in terms of the
singularity spectrum $f(\alpha)$ of individual critical eigenfunctions, in
particular the typical exponents are related via the relation $\kappa_{typ}(b)=
2 (\alpha_{typ}(b)-d)$. We also discuss the statistics of the two-point
transmission in the delocalized phase and in the localized phase.

in a large temperature range from $0.3T_c$ to $1.9T_c$ on anisotropic lattices.
The glueball operators are optimized for the projection of the ground states by
the variational method with a smearing scheme. Their thermal correlators are
calculated in all 20 symmetry channels. It is found in all channels that the
pole masses $M_G$ of glueballs remain almost constant when the temperature is
approaching the critical temperature $T_c$ from below, and start to reduce
gradually with the temperature going above $T_c$. The correlators in the
$0^{++}$, $0^{-+}$, and $2^{++}$ channels are also analyzed based on the
Breit-Wigner $\emph{Ansatz}$ by assuming a thermal width $\Gamma$ to the pole
mass $\omega_0$ of each thermal glueball ground state. While the values of
$\omega_0$ are insensitive to $T$ in the whole temperature range, the thermal
widths $\Gamma$ exhibit distinct behaviors at temperatures below and above
$T_c$. The widths are very small (approximately few percent of $\omega_0$ or
even smaller) when $T<T_c$, but grow abruptly when $T>T_c$ and reach values of
roughly $\Gamma\sim \omega_0/2$ at $T\approx 1.9T_c$.

ferroelectric (with a polarization of ~80 microC/cm2 at 0K). The crystal
structure investigated using X-ray diffraction shows that the films are
epitaxial with a high degree of crystallinity. Chemical analysis carried out by
X-ray Microanalysis and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy indicates the correct
cationic stoichiometry in the BFCO layer, namely (Bi:Fe:Cr = 2:1:1).
Cross-section high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images together
with selected area electron diffraction confirm the crystalline quality of the
epitaxial BFCO films with no identifiable foreign phase or inclusion. The
multiferroic character of BFCO is proven by piezoresponse force microscopy
(PFM) and magnetic measurements showing that the films exhibit ferroelectric
and magnetic hysteresis at room temperature. The local piezoelectric
measurements show the presence of ferroelectric domains and their switching at
the sub-micron scale.

disk instability at various radial distances from the star, considering
different disk masses and surface density distributions. Although the available
mass for accretion increases with radial distance (a) for disk solid surface
density (sigma) functions sigma=sigma_0*a^(-alpha) with alpha < 2, the
accretion timescale is significantly longer at larger radial distances.
Efficient accretion is limited to the first ~ 1E5 years of planetary evolution,
when the planet is extended and before gap opening and type II migration take
place. The accreted mass is calculated for disk masses of 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1
M_sun with alpha = 1/2, 1, and 3/2. We show that a Jupiter-mass protoplanet can
accrete 1 to 110 M_earth of heavy elements, depending on the disk properties.
Our results explain the large variation in heavy element enrichment found in
extra-solar giant planets. Since higher disk surface density is found to lead
to larger heavy element enrichment, our model results are consistent with the
correlation between heavy element enrichment and stellar metallicity. Our
calculations also suggest that Jupiter could have formed at a larger radial
distance than its current location while still accreting the mass of heavy
elements predicted by interior models. We conclude that in the disk instability
model the final composition of a giant planet is strongly determined by its
formation environment. The heavy element abundance of a giant planet does not
discriminate between its origin by either disk instability or core accretion.
