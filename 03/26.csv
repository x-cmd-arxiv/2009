of cosmological parameters. These sources can however be used as standard
candles only after correcting their apparent brightness for a number of
effects. In this paper we discuss some limitations imposed by the formalism
currently used for such corrections and investigate the impact on cosmological
constraints. We show that color corrections are, in general, expected to be
biased. In addition, color excesses which do not add a significant scatter to
the observed SN brightnesses affect the value of cosmological parameters but
leave the slope of the color-luminosity relation unchanged.
  We quantify these biases in the context of the redshift-dependent dust
extinction suggested by the recent detection of intergalactic dust by Menard et
al. (2009). Using a range of models for the opacity of the Universe as a
function of redshift, we find that color-magnitude-stretch scaling relations
are virtually insensitive to the presence of cosmic dust while cosmological
parameters such as Omega_M and w are biased at the level of a few percent, i.e.
offsets comparable to the current statistical errors.
  Future surveys will be able to limit the impact of intergalactic extinction
by observing at larger wavelengths. In addition such datasets will provide
direct detections of intergalactic dust by cross-correlating SN colors and the
density of foreground galaxies, which can be used as a consistency check on the
cosmic dust extinction correction. Alternatively, such biases could be avoided
by correcting the colors of supernovae on an object-by-object basis with
accurate photometry.

(LZ) 77 family, both in terms of speed and memory requirements. Binary search
trees and suffix trees (ST) are data structures that have been often used for
this purpose, as they allow fast searches at the expense of memory usage.
  In recent years, there has been interest on suffix arrays (SA), due to their
simplicity and low memory requirements. One key issue is that an SA can solve
the sub-string problem almost as efficiently as an ST, using less memory. This
paper proposes two new SA-based algorithms for LZ encoding, which require no
modifications on the decoder side. Experimental results on standard benchmarks
show that our algorithms, though not faster, use 3 to 5 times less memory than
the ST counterparts. Another important feature of our SA-based algorithms is
that the amount of memory is independent of the text to search, thus the memory
that has to be allocated can be defined a priori. These features of low and
predictable memory requirements are of the utmost importance in several
scenarios, such as embedded systems, where memory is at a premium and speed is
not critical. Finally, we point out that the new algorithms are general, in the
sense that they are adequate for applications other than LZ compression, such
as text retrieval and forward/backward sub-string search.

paper, we propose a system model for the hybrid hosting platform where stream
processing servers installed at distributed sites are interconnected with a
combination of dedicated links and public Internet. Decentralized algorithms
have been developed for allocation of the two classes of network resources
among the competing tasks with an objective towards higher task throughput and
better utilization of expensive dedicated resources. Results from extensive

description of a curved space steady state gravitational source. Simply by
virtue of not being flat, curved space geometries have to possess intrinsic
length scales, and such length scales can affect the fluid structure. For modes
of wavelength of order or greater than such scales eikonalized geometrical
optics cannot apply and rays are not geodesic. Covariantizing thus entails not
only the replacing of flat space functions by covariant ones, but also the
introduction of intrinsic scales that were absent in flat space. In principle
it is thus unreliable to construct the curved space energy-momentum tensor as
the covariant generalization of a geodesic-based flat spacetime energy-momentum
tensor. By constructing the partition function as an incoherent average over a
complete set of modes of a scalar field propagating in a curved space
background, we show that for the specific case of a static, spherically
symmetric geometry, the steady state energy-momentum tensor that ensues will in
general be of the form
$T_{\mu\nu}=(\rho+p)U_{\mu}U_{\nu}+pg_{\mu\nu}+\pi_{\mu\nu}$ where the
anisotropic $\pi_{\mu\nu}$ is a symmetric, traceless rank two tensor which
obeys $U^{\mu}\pi_{\mu\nu}=0$. Such a $\pi_{\mu\nu}$ type term is absent for an
incoherently averaged steady state fluid in a spacetime where there are no
intrinsic length scales, and in principle would thus be missed in a
covariantizing of a flat spacetime $T_{\mu\nu}$. While the significance of such
$\pi_{\mu\nu}$ type terms would need to be evaluated on a case by case basis,
through the use of kinetic theory we reassuringly find that the effect of such
$\pi_{\mu\nu}$ type terms is small for weak gravity stars where perfect fluid
sources are commonly used.

  We present algorithms that, for certain classes of size-change graphs, deduce
a global ranking function: an expression that ranks program states, and
decreases on every transition. A ranking function serves as a witness for a
termination proof, and is therefore interesting for program certification. The
particular form of the ranking expressions that represent SCT termination
proofs sheds light on the scope of the proof method. The complexity of the
expressions is also interesting, both practicaly and theoretically.
  While deducing ranking functions from size-change graphs has already been
shown possible, the constructions in this paper are simpler and more
transparent than previously known. They improve the upper bound on the size of
the ranking expression from triply exponential down to singly exponential (for
certain classes of instances). We claim that this result is, in some sense,
optimal. To this end, we introduce a framework for lower bounds on the

in terms of scattering coefficients of the whole spin valve, in analogy to the
Landauer conductance formula. The theory is applied to Co/Cu/Ni(001)-based
systems where long-range oscillations of the Ni-torkance as a function of Ni
thickness are predicted. The oscillations represent a novel quantum size effect
due to the non-collinear magnetic structure. The oscillatory behavior of the

multiple processing nodes interconnected according to the data-flow topology of

usually sustain for a long period, it is important to optimally map the
component computations and communications on the nodes and links in the

such as end-to-end latency. The mapping problem is unfortunately NP-complete

stellar population of the dEs, which dominates their mass, is likely coeval
with that of massive ellipticals or bulges, but the star formation efficiency
is lower. Important intermediate age (1-5 Gyr) populations, and frequently
tails of star formation until recent times are detected. These histories are
reminiscent of their lower mass dSph counterparts of the Local Group. Most
galaxies (10/16) show significant metallicity gradients, with metallicity
declining by 0.5 dex over one half-light radius on average. These gradients are
already present in the old population. The flattened (or discy), rotating
objects (6/16) have flat metallicity profiles. This may be consistent with a
distinct origin for these galaxies or it may be due to their geometry. The
central SSP-equivalent age varies between 1 and 6 Gyr, with the age slowly
increasing with radius in the vast majority of objects. The group and cluster
galaxies have similar radial gradients and star-formation histories. The strong
and old metallicity gradients place important constraints on the possible
formation scenarios of dEs. Numerical simulations of the formation of spherical
low-mass galaxies reproduce these gradients, but they require a longer time for
them to build up. A gentle depletion of the gas, by ram-pressure stripping or
starvation, could drive the gas-rich, star-forming progenitors to the present

double-layer Boussinesq-type model which is linearly and nonlinearly accurate
up to deep water. Assuming the flow to be irrotational, we formulate the
problem in terms of the velocity potential thereby lowering the number of
unknowns. The model derivation combines two approaches, namely the method
proposed by Agnon et al. (Agnon et al. 1999, J. Fluid Mech., 399 pp. 319-333)
and enhanced by Madsen et al. (Madsen et al. 2003, Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A, 459

to the Laplace equation, to truncate them at a finite order and to use Pad\'e
approximants, and the double-layer approach of Lynett & Liu (Lynett & Liu 2004,
Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A, 460 pp. 2637-2669) allowing to lower the order of
derivatives. We formulate the model in terms of a static Dirichlet-Neumann
operator translated from the free surface to the still-water level, and we
derive an approximate inverse of this operator that can be built once and for
all. The final model consists of only four equations both in one and two
horizontal dimensions, and includes only second-order derivatives, which is a
major improvement in comparison with so-called high-order Boussinesq models. A
linear analysis of the model is performed and its properties are optimized
using a free parameter determining the position of the interface between the
two layers. Excellent dispersion and shoaling properties are obtained, allowing
the model to be applied up to deep water. Finally, numerical simulations are
performed to quantify the nonlinear behaviour of the model, and the results
exhibit a nonlinear range of validity reaching deep water areas.

Einstein-Hilbert action modified by the addition of the so-called Holst term.
Classically, this term does not affect the equations of motion, but it induces
a well-known quantization ambiguity in the quantum theory, parametrized by the
Barbero--Immirzi parameter. Recently, it has been suggested to promote the
Barbero--Immirzi parameter to a field. The resulting theory, obtainable
starting from the usual Holst action, is General Relativity coupled to a
pseudo-scalar field. However, this theory turns out to have an unconventional
kinetic term for the BI field and a rather unnatural coupling with fermions.
The main goal of this work is twofold: Firstly, to propose a further
generalization of the Holst action, which yields a theory of gravity and matter
with a more natural coupling to the Barbero--Immirzi field; secondly, to study
the possible implications for cosmology correlated to the existence of this new
pseudo-scalar field.

Our estimate of the bolometric luminosity indicates that the active galactic
nucleus (AGN) is radiating at or above its Eddington Luminosity, which is
consistent with its identification as a hidden Narrow-Line Seyfert 1. We were
able to successfully match the observed emission line ratios with a
three-component photoionization model. Two components, one to account for the
[O III] emission and another in which the [Fe X] arises, are directly ionized
by the AGN, while [O II] forms in a third component, which is ionized by a
heavily absorbed continuum. Based on our assumed ionizing continuum and the
model parameters, we determined that the two directly-ionized components are ~
55 pc from the AGN. We have found similar radial distances for the central
knots in the Seyfert 2 galaxies Mrk 3 and NGC 1068, but much smaller radial
distances for the inner NLR in the Seyfert 1 galaxies NGC 4151 and NGC 5548.

selected only on the basis of their radio-continuum fluxes. The main result of
this survey is the very low content in molecular gas of such galaxies compared
to FIR selected galaxies. The median value of the molecular gas mass, taking
into account the upper limits, is 1x10^8 Msun; if we calculate it for all the
galaxies together, and if we separate them into FR-I and FR-II type galaxies,
an important difference is found between them. Moreover, the CO spectra
indicates the presence of a central molecular gas disk in these radio galaxies.
Our results contrast with previous surveys, mainly selected through the FIR
emission, with a larger mass of molecular gas observed. The first results
indicate that minor mergers are good candidates to fuel the central part of the

biased double-layer graphene system is studied theoretically. The main emphasis
is put on obtaining a reliable analytical estimate for the transition
temperature into the excitonic state. As in a double-layer graphene system the
total number of fermionic ""flavors"" is equal to N=8 due to two projections of
spin, two valleys, and two layers, the large-$N$ approximation appears to be
especially suitable for theoretical investigation of the system. On the other
hand, the large number of flavors makes screening of the bare Coulomb
interactions very efficient, which, together with the suppression of
backscattering in graphene, leads to an extremely low energy of the excitonic
condensation. It is shown that the effect of screening on the excitonic pairing
is just as strong in the excitonic state as it is in the normal state. As a
result, the value of the excitonic gap $\De$ is found to be in full agreement
with the previously obtained estimate for the mean-field transition temperature
$T_c$, the maximum possible value $\Delta^{\rm max},T_c^{\rm max}\sim 10^{-7}
\epsilon_F$ ($\epsilon_F$ is the Fermi energy) of both being in $ 1{\rm mK}$

10^{-7} \epsilon_F$ really sets the upper bound for the transition temperature
and invalidates the recently expressed conjecture about the high-temperature
first-order transition into the excitonic state. These findings suggest that,
unfortunately, the excitonic condensation in graphene double-layers can hardly
be realized experimentally.

foreground emission contributes to the observed non-Gaussianities. However, the
application of a high-pass filter that removes large angular scale power does
improve the consistency with the best-fitting cosmological model. Two-point
correlation functions of the local extrema are calculated for both the

1536+044 is an example of line emission from a disc. If this is correct, the
lack of clear optical spectral evidence for close SMBs is significant and
argues either that the merging of close SMBs is much faster than has generally
been hitherto thought, or if the approach is slow, that when the separation of

We consider a
direct application of one of these effects, namely topological currents, on the
physics of neutron stars. All the elements required for topological currents
are present in neutron stars: degenerate matter, large magnetic fields, and
P-parity violating processes. These conditions lead to the creation of vector
currents capable of carrying momentum and inducing magnetic fields. We estimate
the size of these currents for many representative states of dense matter in
the neutron star and argue that they could be responsible for the large proper
motion of neutron stars (kicks), the toroidal magnetic field and finite
magnetic helicity needed for stability of the poloidal field, and the
resolution of the conflict between type-II superconductivity and precession.
Though these observational effects appear unrelated, they likely originate from
the same physics -- they are all P-odd phenomena that stem from a topological
current generated by parity violation.

The data clearly indicate a sharp decrease in millimeter optical depth at the

AU from the star. We refine the accretion disk model of Calvet et al. (2005)
based on the unresolved spectral energy distribution (SED) and demonstrate that
it reproduces well the spatially resolved millimeter continuum data at both
available wavelengths. We also present complementary SMA observations of CO
J=3-2 and J=2-1 emission from the disk at 2"" resolution. The observed CO
morphology is consistent with the continuum model prediction, with two
significant deviations: (1) the emission displays a larger CO J=3-2/J=2-1 line
ratio than predicted, which may indicate additional heating of gas in the upper
disk layers; and (2) the position angle of the kinematic rotation pattern
differs by 11 +/- 2 degrees from that measured at smaller scales from the dust
continuum, which may indicate the presence of a warp. We note that
photoevaporation, grain growth, and binarity are unlikely mechanisms for
inducing the observed sharp decrease in opacity or surface density at the disk
center. The inner hole plausibly results from the dynamical influence of a
planet on the disk material. Warping induced by a planet could also potentially
explain the difference in position angle between the continuum and CO data

extremely sensitive probe of long-range interactions between dark-matter
particles. Dark-matter forces that are several percent the strength of gravity
will lead to order unity changes in the ratio of the number of stars in the
leading and trailing tidal streams of a satellite galaxy. The approximate
symmetry of the stellar tidal streams of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy would
thus exclude attractive dark-matter forces greater than 10% the strength of
gravity which would entirely eliminate the leading stream. However, recent
simulations suggest that dark-matter forces 100% the strength of gravity could
completely strip the stellar component of Sagittarius of its dark matter,
allowing for the subsequent development of symmetric tidal streams. Here we
argue that these simulations use inconsistent initial conditions corresponding
to separate pure stellar and pure dark-matter satellites moving independently
in the host galaxy's halo, rather than a single disrupting composite satellite
as had been intended. A new simulation with different initial conditions, in
particular a much more massive satellite galaxy, might demonstrate a scenario
in which symmetric tidal streams develop in the presence of large dark-matter
forces. This scenario must satisfy several highly restrictive criteria
described in this paper.

echelle orders to cover part of the J band from 1.165 to 1.323 microns with

determined based on the minimum RMS of the differences between the modelled and
observed relative fluxes. The modelled spectra reproduce quite well the
observed features for most of the T dwarfs, with Teff in the range of 922-1009
K, and logg between 4.3 and 5 (cm s^-2). Our results support the assumption of
a dust free atmosphere for T dwarfs later than T5, where dust grains form and
then gravitationally sediment into the low atmosphere. The modelled spectra do
not accurately mimic some individual very strong lines like the KI doublet at
1.2436 and 1.2525 microns. Our modelled spectra does not match well the
observed spectra of the two T dwarfs with earlier spectral types, namely SDSSp
J125453.90-012247.4 (T2) and 2MASS J05591914-1404488 (T4.5), which is likely
due to the presence of condensate clouds that are not incorporated in the
models used here. By comparing our results and their uncertainties to
evolutionary models, we estimate masses in the interval ~5-75 MJ for T dwarfs
later than T5, which are in good agreement with those found in the literature.
We found apparent young ages that are typically between 0.1 and a few Gyr for
the same T dwarfs, which is consistent with recent kinematical studies.

electron doping in CeT(In{1-x}Mx)5 with M=Sn and hole doping with Cd or Hg have
a dramatic effect on the electronic properties at very low concentrations. The
present work reports EXAFS measurements that address the substituent atom
distribution as a function of T, M, and x, near the superconducting phase.
Together with previous measurements for M=Sn, the proportion of the M atom
residing on the In(1) site, f{In(1)}, increases in the order M=Cd, Sn, and Hg,
ranging from about 40% to 70%, showing a strong preference for these
substituents to occupy the In(1) site (random=20%). In addition, f{In(1)}
ranges from 70% to 100% for M=Hg in the order T=Co, Rh, and Ir. These fractions
track the changes in the atomic radii of the various species, and help explain
the sharp dependence of Tc on substituting into the In site. However, it is
difficult to reconcile the small concentrations of M with the dramatic changes
in the ground state in the hole-doped materials with only an impurity
scattering model. These results therefore indicate that while such
substitutions have interesting local atomic structures with important
electronic and magnetic consequences, other local changes in the electronic and

proposed and its implications are discussed. This definition, in turn, leads to
a method allowing to distinguish in principle tetraquark and molecular states.
The different concept of `dynamical reconstruction' is also introduced and
applies to the generation of preexisting mesons (quark-antiquark, glueballs,
>...) via unitarization methods applied to low-energy effective Lagrangians.
Large $N_{c}$ arguments play an important role in all these investigations. A
simple toy model with two scalar fields is introduced to elucidate these
concepts. The large $N_{c}$ behavior of the parameters is chosen in order that
the two scalar fields behave as quark-antiquark mesons. When the heavier field
is integrated out, one is left with an effective Lagrangian with the lighter
field only. A unitarization method applied to the latter allows to
`reconstruct' the heavier `quarkonium-like' field, which was previously
integrated out. It is shown that a Bethe-Salpeter (BS) analysis is capable to
reproduce the preformed quark-antiquark state. However, when only the lowest
term of the effective Lagrangian is retained, the large $N_{c}$ limit of the
reconstructed state is not reproduced: instead of the correct large $N_{c}$
quarkonium limit, it fades out as a molecular state would do. Implications of
these results are presented: it is proposed that axial-vector, tensor and
(some) scalar mesons just above 1 GeV obtained via the BS approach from the
corresponding low-energy, effective Lagrangian in which only the lowest term is
kept, are quarkonia states, in agreement with the constituent quark model,
although they might fade away as molecular states in the large $N_{c}$ limit.

consider interactions between particles due to a central interatomic potential.
  From the singularity conditions of the corresponding system of hard-sphere

ionization results in a transfer of power to higher multipoles in the large

$\tau_{3\sigma} < 0.013$ per $\sim 10$ km/s. For the latter 26 systems, the
spin temperature $T_s$ of the absorber must be $> [800 \times f]$ K (where $f$

explore how cells can maximize their control power in the presence of these
physical limits; formally, we solve the theoretical problem of maximizing the
information transferred from inputs to outputs when the number of available
molecules is held fixed. We start with the simplest version of the problem, in
which a single transcription factor protein controls the readout of one or more
genes by binding to DNA. We further simplify by assuming that this regulatory
network operates in steady state, that the noise is small relative to the
available dynamic range, and that the target genes do not interact. Even in
this simple limit, we find a surprisingly rich set of optimal solutions.
Importantly, for each locally optimal regulatory network, all parameters are
determined once the physical constraints on the number of available molecules
are specified. Although we are solving an over--simplified version of the
problem facing real cells, we see parallels between the structure of these
optimal solutions and the behavior of actual genetic regulatory networks.

quasar luminosities follows a universal light curve form: an initial
exponential growth at constant Eddington ratio of order unity until it reaches
the peak luminosity, followed by a power-law decay. Assuming that the peak
luminosity correlates with the post-merger halo mass, we convolve the light
curve with the triggering rate of quasar activity to predict the quasar
luminosity function (LF). Our model reproduces the observed LF at 0.5<z<4.5 for
the full luminosity ranges probed by current optical and X-ray surveys. Our
model reproduces both the observed redshift evolution and luminosity dependence
of the linear bias of quasar/AGN clustering. Due to the scatter between
instantaneous luminosity and halo mass, quasar/AGN clustering weakly depends on
luminosity at low to intermediate luminosities; but the linear bias rises
rapidly with luminosity at the high luminosity end and at high redshift. In our
model, the Eddington ratio distribution is roughly log-normal, which broadens
and shifts to lower mean values from high luminosity quasars (L_bol>~10^46 erg
s^-1) to low luminosity AGNs (L_bol<~ 10^45 erg s^-1), in good agreement with
observations.

  Paper",,,,"astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Promoting racial and ethnic diversity is critically important to the future
success and growth of the field of astronomy. The raw ability, drive and
interest required to excel in the field is distributed without regard to race,
gender, or socioeconomic background. By not actively promoting diversity in our
field we risk losing talented people to other professions (or losing them
entirely), which means that there will be astronomical discoveries that simply
won't get made. There is demonstrated evidence that STEM fields benefit from
diverse perspectives on problems that require more complex thought processes.
This is especially relevant to a field like astronomy where more and more work
is being done collaboratively. The lack of notable growth in African American,
Hispanic, and Native American representation in astronomy indicates that the
'pipeline' for these individuals is systemically leaky at critical junctures.
Substantially more effort must be directed toward improving the educational and
career development of minorities to insure that these potential colleagues are
supported through the process. However, simply recognizing that the pipeline is
faulty is woefully inadequate. There must be very specific, targeted solutions
to help improve the situation. With this in mind, we offer two position papers
addressing specific areas of improvement that we identify as (a) essential for
any foreseeable progress in the field, and (b) attainable in the 2010-2020
decade. These position papers focus primarily on African Americans, Hispanics,
and Native Americans. Although we do not directly address issues of Asian
Americans, Pacific Islanders, and other groups, many of the recommendations
made here can be adapted to address issues faced by these groups as well.

are ""clients"", open a set of at most $k$ facilities to minimize the average
distance from the clients to these facilities. This is just the well-studied
$k$-median problem, for which many approximation algorithms and hardness
results are known. Note that the objective function encourages opening
facilities in areas where there are many clients, and given a solution, it is
often possible to get a good idea of where the clients are located. However,
this poses the following quandary: what if the identity of the clients is
sensitive information that we would like to keep private? Is it even possible
to design good algorithms for this problem that preserve the privacy of the
clients?
  In this paper, we initiate a systematic study of algorithms for discrete
optimization problems in the framework of differential privacy (which
formalizes the idea of protecting the privacy of individual input elements). We
show that many such problems indeed have good approximation algorithms that
preserve differential privacy; this is even in cases where it is impossible to
preserve cryptographic definitions of privacy while computing any non-trivial
approximation to even the_value_ of an optimal solution, let alone the entire
solution.
  Apart from the $k$-median problem, we study the problems of vertex and set

used to obtain deep, high-resolution images of the intermediate-age star
cluster NGC 1846 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. We present new color-magnitude
diagrams (CMDs) based on F435W, F555W, and F814W imaging. We test the
previously observed broad main sequence turnoff region for ""contamination"" by
field stars and (evolved) binary star systems. We find that while these impact
the number of objects in this region, none can fully account for the large
color spread. Our results therefore solidify the recent finding that stars in
the main sequence turnoff region of this cluster have a large spread in color
which is unrelated to measurement errors or contamination by field stars, and
likely due to a ~300 Myr range in the ages of cluster stars. An unbiased
estimate of the stellar density distribution across the main sequence turnoff
region shows that the spread is fairly continuous rather than strongly bimodal
as suggested previously. We fit the CMDs with several different sets of
theoretical isochrones, and determine systematic uncertainties for population
parameters when derived using any one set of isochrones. We note a degeneracy
between age and [alpha/Fe], which can be lifted by matching the shape
(curvature) of the full red giant branch in the CMD. We find that stars in the
upper part of the main sequence turnoff region are more centrally concentrated
than those in any other region of the CMD, including more massive red giant
branch and asymptotic giant branch stars. We consider several possible
formation scenarios which account for the unusual features observed in the CMD
of NGC 1846.

paper channel (FDPC) Y = H(X + S) + Z is considered when there is imperfect
knowledge of the channel state information H at the transmitter (CSIT). The
case of FDPC with positive definite (p.d.) input covariance matrix was studied
by the authors in a recent paper, and here the more general case of positive
semi-definite (p.s.d.) input covariance is dealt with. Towards this end, the
choice of auxiliary random variable is modified. The algorithms for
determination of inflation factor proposed in the p.d. case are then
generalized to the case of p.s.d. input covariance. Subsequently, the largest
DPC-achievable high-SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) scaling factor over the no-CSIT
FDPC with p.s.d. input covariance matrix is derived. This scaling factor is
seen to be a non-trivial generalization of the one achieved for the p.d. case.
Next, in the limit of low SNR, it is proved that the choice of all-zero
inflation factor (thus treating interference as noise) is optimal in the
'ratio' sense, regardless of the covariance matrix used. Further, in the p.d.
covariance case, the inflation factor optimal at high SNR is obtained when the
number of transmit antennas is greater than the number of receive antennas,
with the other case having been already considered in the earlier paper.
Finally, the problem of joint optimization of the input covariance matrix and
the inflation factor is dealt with, and an iterative numerical algorithm is
developed.

which often display a roughness covering a broad range of length scales.
Because of the small distance separating the fracture walls, the surface
roughness is a key parameter influencing the structure of the void space.
Studies devoted to the characterization of the surface roughness are presented
as well as works aimed at characterizing the void space geometry. The
correlation of the free space is found to be crucially function of the failure
mechanism (brittle, quasi brittle or plastic...) but also of possible shear
displacements during the failure. The influence of the surface roughness on the
mechanical behavior of fractures under a normal load and a shear stress is also
described. Finally, experimental, numerical and theoretical works devoted to
the study of the influence of the fracture void geometry on the permeability
and on the hydrodynamic dispersion of a dissolved species are discussed.

establish their basic properties, including the John-Nirenberg inequality for
$\mathrm{BMO}_\rho({\mathcal X})$, several equivalent characterizations for
$\mathrm{BLO}_\rho({\mathcal X})$, and some relations between these spaces.
Then the authors obtain the boundedness on these localized spaces of several
operators including the natural maximal operator, the Hardy-Littlewood maximal
operator, the radial maximal functions and their localized versions associated
to $\rho$, and the Littlewood-Paley $g$-function associated to $\rho$, where
the Littlewood-Paley $g$-function and some of the radial maximal functions are
defined via kernels which are modeled on the semigroup generated by the
Schr\""odinger operator. These results apply in a wide range of settings, for
instance, to the Schr\""odinger operator or the degenerate Schr\""odinger
operator on ${{\mathbb R}}^d$, or the sub-Laplace Schr\""odinger operator on
Heisenberg groups or connected and simply connected nilpotent Lie groups.

molecular formation rate, which are due to coherent transient dynamics in the

photoassociation signal as a function of the pulse energy reveal a non-linear

stars represents an important tool for deriving information on fundamental
stellar parameters and internal structure, as well as for testing current

increased during the last decade and about 30 members are presently known in
the literature. AIMS: We have constructed the frequency spectrum of the
oscillations in V346 Ori. We apply asteroseismic tools to these data to
estimate the intrinsic parameters (mass, luminosity, effective temperature) of
V346 Ori and to obtain information on its internal structure. METHODS: CCD time
series photometry in the Johnson V filter has been obtained for a total of
145.7 h of observations distributed over 36 nights. The resulting light curves
have been subjected to a detailed frequency analysis using updated numerical
techniques. Photometric and spectroscopic data have also been acquired to
determine reliable estimates of the stellar properties. RESULTS: We have
identified 13 oscillation frequencies, 6 of which with higher significance.
These have been compared with the predictions of non-radial adiabatic models.
The resulting best fit model has a mass of 2.1$\pm$0.2 $M_{\odot}$, luminosity
$\log{L/L_{\odot}}=1.37^{+0.11}_{-0.13}$, and effective temperature
7300$\pm$200 K. These values are marginally consistent with the association of
V346 Ori to Orion OB1a. Alternatively, V346 Ori could be placed at a slightly
larger distance than previously estimated.

LCDM cosmology to study the effects of dark matter substructures on
gravitational lensing. Each halo is resolved with ~ 10^8 particles (at a mass
resolution ~ 10^3-4 M_sun/h) within its virial radius. Subhaloes with masses
larger than 10^5 M_sun/h are well resolved, an improvement of at least two
orders of magnitude over previous lensing studies. We incorporate a baryonic
component modelled as a Hernquist profile and account for the response of the
dark matter via adiabatic contraction. We focus on the ""anomalous"" flux ratio
problem, in particular on the violation of the cusp-caustic relation due to
substructures. We find that subhaloes with masses less than ~ 10^8 M_sun/h play
an important role in causing flux anomalies; such low mass subhaloes have been
unresolved in previous studies. There is large scatter in the predicted flux
ratios between different haloes and between different projections of the same
halo. In some cases, the frequency of predicted anomalous flux ratios is
comparable to that observed for the radio lenses, although in most cases it is
not. The probability for the simulations to reproduce the observed violations
of the cusp lenses is about 0.001. We therefore conclude that the amount of
substructure in the central regions of the Aquarius haloes is insufficient to
explain the observed frequency of violations of the cusp-caustic relation.
These conclusions are based purely on our dark matter simulations which ignore
the effect of baryons on subhalo survivability.

pancyclic if it contains cycles of length $\ell$ for all $3 \le \ell \le n$.
Write $\alpha(G)$ for the independence number of $G$, i.e. the size of the
largest subset of the vertex set that does not contain an edge, and $\kappa(G)$
for the (vertex) connectivity, i.e. the size of the smallest subset of the
vertex set that can be deleted to obtain a disconnected graph. A celebrated
theorem of Chv\'atal and Erd\H{o}s says that $G$ is Hamiltonian if $\kappa(G)
\ge \alpha(G)$. Moreover, Bondy suggested that almost any non-trivial
conditions for Hamiltonicity of a graph should also imply pancyclicity.
Motivated by this, we prove that if $\kappa(G) \ge 600\alpha(G)$ then G is
pancyclic. This establishes a conjecture of Jackson and Ordaz up to a constant
factor. Moreover, we obtain the more general result that if G is Hamiltonian
with minimum degree $\delta(G) \ge 600\alpha(G)$ then G is pancyclic. Improving
an old result of Erd\H{o}s, we also show that G is pancyclic if it is

of independent interest on cycle lengths in graphs: if $\delta(G) \ge

is confined and the equations of motion have linearization instabilities. We
prove that the only stationary, axially symmetric solutions of chiral gravity
are BTZ black holes, which have positive energy. It is further shown that
classical log gravity-- the theory with logarithmically relaxed boundary
conditions --has finite asymptotic symmetry generators but is not chiral and
hence may be dual at the quantum level to a logarithmic CFT. Moreover we show
that log gravity contains chiral gravity within it as a decoupled charge
superselection sector. We normally evaluate the Euclidean sum over geometries
of chiral gravity and show that it gives precisely the holomorphic extremal CFT
partition function. The modular invariance and integrality of the expansion
coefficients of this partition function are consistent with the existence of an
exact quantum theory of chiral gravity. We argue that the problem of quantizing
chiral gravity is the holographic dual of the problem of constructing an
extremal CFT, while quantizing log gravity is dual to the problem of

for building up a preplanetary disk - once more it turned out that it is of the
order of one free-fall time which is decisively shorter than the widely assumed
timescale related to the so-called 'inside-out collapse'; (2) Redistribution of
angular momentum and the accompanying dissipation of kinetic (rotational)
energy - together these processes govern the mechanical and thermal evolution
of the protostellar core to a large extent; (3) The origin of
calcium-aluminium-rich inclusions (CAIs) - due to the specific pattern of the
accretion flow, material that has undergone substantial chemical and
mineralogical modifications in the hot (exceeding 900 K) interior of the
protostellar core may have a good chance to be advectively transported outward
into the cooler remote parts (beyond 4 AU, say) of the growing disk and to
survive there until it is incorporated into a meteoritic body.

multiplexing in multi-input multi-output (MIMO) channels with imperfect channel
state information at the transmitter (CSIT). We show that with imperfect CSIT,
a higher diversity gain as well as a more efficient diversity-multiplexing
tradeoff (DMT) can be achieved. In the case of multi-input single-output
(MISO)/single-input multi-output (SIMO) channels with K transmit/receive
antennas, one can achieve a diversity gain of d(r)=K(1-r+K\alpha) at spatial
multiplexing gain r, where \alpha is the CSIT quality defined in this paper.
For general MIMO channels with M (M>1) transmit and N (N>1) receive antennas,
we show that depending on the value of \alpha, different DMT can be derived and
the value of \alpha has a great impact on the achievable diversity, especially
at high multiplexing gains. Specifically, when \alpha is above a certain
threshold, one can achieve a diversity gain of d(r)=MN(1+MN\alpha)-(M+N-1)r;
otherwise, the achievable DMT is much lower and can be described as a
collection of discontinuous line segments depending on M, N, r and \alpha. Our
analysis reveals that imperfect CSIT significantly improves the achievable
diversity gain while enjoying high spatial multiplexing gains.

Max-Weight Matching (GMWM) scheduling policy stabilizes the network for any
supportable arrival rate vector within the network capacity region. This
policy, however, often requires the solution of an NP-hard optimization
problem. This has motivated many researchers to develop sub-optimal algorithms
that approximate the GMWM policy in selecting schedule vectors. One implicit
assumption commonly shared in this context is that during the algorithm
runtime, the channel states remain effectively unchanged. This assumption may
not hold as the time needed to select near-optimal schedule vectors usually
increases quickly with the network size. In this paper, we incorporate channel
variations and the time-efficiency of sub-optimal algorithms into the scheduler
design, to dynamically tune the algorithm runtime considering the tradeoff
between algorithm efficiency and its robustness to changing channel states.
Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Control Policy (DCP) that operates on top of
a given sub-optimal algorithm, and dynamically but in a large time-scale
adjusts the time given to the algorithm according to queue backlog and channel
correlations. This policy does not require knowledge of the structure of the
given sub-optimal algorithm, and with low overhead can be implemented in a
distributed manner. Using a novel Lyapunov analysis, we characterize the
throughput stability region induced by DCP and show that our characterization
can be tight. We also show that the throughput stability region of DCP is at
least as large as that of any other static policy. Finally, we provide two case
studies to gain further intuition into the performance of DCP.

Effective field theory methods and dimensional reduction are used to separate
the contributions from the two momentum scales: The hard contribution can be
calculated as a power series in $g^2$ using naive perturbation theory with bare
propagators. The soft contribution can be calculated using an effective theory
in three dimensions, whose coefficients are power series in $g^2$. This
contribution is a power series in $g$ starting at order $g^3$. The calculation
of the hard part to order $g^6$ involves a complicated four-loop sum-integral
that was recently calculated by Gynther, Laine, Schr\""oder, Torrero, and
Vuorinen. The calculation of the soft part requires calculating the mass
parameter in the effective theory to order $g^6$ and the evaluation of
five-loop vacuum diagrams in three dimensions. This gives the free energy
correct up to order $g^7$. The coefficients of the effective theory satisfy a
set of renormalization group equations that can be used to sum up leading and
subleading logarithms of $T/gT$. We use the solutions to these equations to
obtain a result for the free energy which is correct to order $g^8\log(g)$.
Finally, we investigate the convergence of the perturbative series.

the dimension of the model space of configuration interaction approaches by an
a priori selection of the physically most relevant basis states. Using an
importance measure derived from multiconfigurational perturbation theory in
combination with an importance threshold, we construct a model space optimized
for the description of individual eigenstates of a given Hamiltonian. We
discuss in detail various technical aspects and refinements of the importance
truncation, such as perturbative corrections for excluded basis states,
threshold extrapolation techniques, and different iterative model-space update
schemes. We apply the idea of the importance truncation in the context of the
no-core shell model (NCSM) for the ab initio description of nuclear ground
states. In a series of benchmark calculations for closed- and open-shell nuclei
up to O-16 we compare the ground-state energies obtained in the importance
truncated NCSM to the full NCSM. All calculations show an excellent agreement
of importance truncated and full NCSM for all cases where the latter is
feasible. The results demonstrate that the importance truncated NCSM, while
preserving most of the advantages of the full NCSM, gives access to much larger
N_max*hbar*Omega spaces and heavier nuclei. In this way we are able to perform
importance truncated NCSM calculations for nuclei like C-12 and O-16 up to
N_max=22.
