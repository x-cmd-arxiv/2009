of excited hadrons with fixed $L$ possible?"" In general, the solutions of the
bound state Hamiltonian equation of motion in QCD have Fock state components
with different $L$, and consequently hadronic relativistic wave equations
derived in the framework of light-front holography share this property. For
example, the proton eigenstate has components with L=0 and L=1. The results of
AdS/QCD are consistent with the requirements of chiral symmetry and do not
violate any fundamental physical principle. This is further illustrated with
various examples.

  Multiprocessor Systems","22 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In multiprocessor systems, various problems are treated with Lamport's
logical clock and the resultant logical time orders between operations.
However, one often needs to face the high complexities caused by the lack of
logical time order information in practice. In this paper, we utilize the
\emph{global clock} to infuse the so-called \emph{pending period} to each
operation in a multiprocessor system, where the pending period is a time
interval that contains the performed time of the operation. Further, we define
the \emph{physical time order} for any two operations with disjoint pending
periods. The physical time order is obeyed by any real execution in
multiprocessor systems due to that it is part of the truly happened operation
orders restricted by global clock, and it is then proven to be independent and
consistent with traditional logical time orders. The above novel yet
fundamental concepts enables new effective approaches for analyzing
multiprocessor systems, which are named \emph{pending period analysis} as a
whole. As a consequence of pending period analysis, many important problems of
multiprocessor systems can be tackled effectively. As a significant application
example, complete memory consistency verification, which was known as an
NP-hard problem, can be solved with the complexity of $O(n^2)$ (where $n$ is
the number of operations). Moreover, the two event ordering problems, which
were proven to be Co-NP-Hard and NP-hard respectively, can both be solved with
the time complexity of O(n) if restricted by pending period information.

An epistemologicalphysical, strictly qualitative discipline, IQM (infra-quantum
mechanics), is constructed independently of the mathematical formalism of QM.
IQM emerges under exclusively the constraints imposed by: the cognitive
situation of a human being who decides to construct communicable and consensual
knowledge on microstates; general requirements of human conceptualization. IMQ
brings into evidence how the mathematical formalism of QM manages to signify.
It explicates an integrated expression of a radically new type of descriptional
form, transferred on the registering devices of macroscopic apparatuses and
primordially statistical. IMQ is then considered globally and its relations
with space, time, geometry, consensus, as well as with Einstein's theories, are
specified. It appears that: there exists an order of progressive
constructability of our conceptualizations of physical reality; this order
withstands inclusion of concepts constructed inside macroscopic physics, into
the primordial transferred representation of microstates; consequently the aim
of directly unifying Einstein's theories, with QM, appears to be impossible.
Bell's theorem on locality expresses exclusively this impossibility. Causality
appears to be a modelizing concept that cannot be implemented into our
primordial representations of physical entities.

gamma-gamma collisions is explored in the context of the linear colliders
within the general Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM). Two different mechanisms are
analyzed: on the one hand, the scattering gamma gamma-> h of two real photons
in a gamma-gamma collider; on the other, the more traditional mechanism of
virtual photon fusion, e+e- -->e+e- + h. Owing to the peculiar properties of
the Higgs boson self-interactions within the general 2HDM, we find that the
overall production rates can be boosted up significantly, provided the charged
Higgs mass is not too heavy. For example, if the latter is slightly above 100
GeV and, in addition, the lightest CP-even Higgs boson falls in the ballpark of
the LEP bound on the SM Higgs mass up to a few hundred GeV, the cross-sections
may typically render \sigma(gamma gamma-> h)= 0.1-1 pb and \sigma(e+e- --> e+e-
+ h)\sim 0.01 pb -- in both cases well above the SM prediction. Although for
charged Higgs masses above 300 GeV the rates become virtually insensitive to
the Higgs boson self-couplings, a significant tail of non-SM effects produced
by the combined contribution of the Yukawa couplings and gauge bosons could
still reveal a smoking gun.

part of the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme-AO (SCExAO) system currently under
assembly. Lossless pupil apodization is performed by a set of aspheric PIAA
lenses specifically designed to also remove the pupil's central obstruction,
coupled with a Spider Removal Plate (SRP) which removes spider vanes by
translating four parts of the pupil with tilted plane-parallel plates. An
""inverse-PIAA"" system, located after the coronagraphic focal plane mask, is
used to remove off-axis aberrations and deliver a wide field of view.
  Our results validate the concept adopted for the SCExAO system, and show that
the Subaru Telescope pupil can properly be apodized for high contrast
coronagraphic imaging as close as $\approx$ 1 $\lambda/D$ with no loss of
sensitivity. We also verify that off-axis aberrations in the system are in
agreement with theory, and that the inverse PIAA system recovers a wide usable

matter and an associated unsolved dynamical issue to be settled. We promote
this observation to the status of an axiom and conjecture that there is a dark
companion to every baryonic matter, subject to certain rules as regards its
size, distribution. To pursue the proposition in a systematic way we resort to
the rotation curves of spiral galaxies. They have non classical features.
First, we design a spacetime metric around the galaxy to accommodate these
features. Next we calculate the density and pressure of a hypothetical dark
matter that could generate such a spacetime. In the weak field regime and for a
spherical distribution of mass $M$, we are able to assign a dark perfect gas
companion, whose density is almost proportional to $M^{1/2}$ and fades away
almost as $r^{-2}$. However, in view of this orderly relation between the
observable mass and its dark companion, one may choose to interpret the whole
scenario as an alternative theory of gravitation.

of the flux density of Cas A at ~80 MHz is rather stable over five decades of
time, decreasing at a rate of 0.7-0.8% yr^-1. This is entirely consistent with
previous estimates at frequencies as low as 38 MHz, indicating that the secular
decrease is roughly the same at low frequencies, at least between 38 and 80
MHz. We also find strong evidence for as many as four modes of flux density
oscillation about the slower secular decrease with periods of 3.10+/-0.02$ yr,
5.1+/-0.3 yr, 9.0+/-0.2 yr, and 24+/-2 yr. These are also consistent with
fluctuations seen previously to occur on scales of a few years. These results
provide compelling motivation for a thorough low frequency monitoring campaign
of Cas A to constrain the nature and physical origins of these fluctuations,
and to be able to better predict the flux density of Cas A at any given epoch

the scaling of the ground state entanglement entropy at the quantum critical

the degree of a node (the number of the node's neighbors). Because of its
discrete nature, when the degree measure was used in analyzing weighted
networks, weights were either ignored or thresholded in order to retain or
disregard an edge. Therefore, despite its popularity, the degree measure fails
to capture the disparity of interaction between a node and its neighbors.
  We introduce in this paper a generalization of the degree measure that
addresses this limitation: the continuous node degree (C-degree). The C-degree
of a node reflects how many neighbors are effectively being used, taking
interaction disparity into account. More importantly, if a node interacts
uniformly with its neighbors (no interaction disparity), we prove that the
C-degree of the node becomes identical to the node's (discrete) degree. We
analyze four real-world weighted networks using the new measure and show that
the C-degree distribution follows the power-law, similar to the traditional
degree distribution, but with steeper decline. We also show that the ratio
between the C-degree and the (discrete) degree follows a pattern that is common
in the four studied networks.

Given the enormous

Universe must be of the order of its size ct.It turns out that it is about 6
times larger. Hence inside the volume of size ct there is an outward electrical
pressure due to the lack of complete screening of the electrical charges. We
suggest that these charges are related to the vacuum fluctuations. To the
question of why the Universe does not collapse under its own gravitational
attraction we analyze the possibility to answer this by the effect of the
repulsive forces of these electrical charges. Evidence in support of the idea
that space is not expanding is growing more and more in the scientific
literature. As a frame of work we consider the model of a constant size
Universe that implies a constant equilibrium between the gravitational (GM2/R2)

converts Planck units of mass, length, time, charge e and angular momentum h,
into the mass M, size ct, age t, total charge Q and angular momentum of the
Universe as in a scale-like way. It defines a black hole of mass M 10^56gr.,

maximum angular momentum H 10^120 h which is our Universe. We are inside it, a

frequently applied to solve algorithmic problems, such as the congruence
problem for ideals. Until now, these ideas have been transmitted to different
in part non-commutative and non-Noetherian algebras. Most of these approaches
require an admissible ordering on terms. In this Ph.D.thesis, the concept of
Groebner bases is generalized to finitely generated monoid and group rings.
Reduction methods are applied to represent monoid and group elements and to
describe the right-ideal congruence in the corresponding monoid and group
rings, respectively. In general, monoids and especially groups do not offer
admissible orderings anymore. Thus, the definition of an appropriate reduction
relation is confronted with the following problems: On the one hand, it is
difficult to guarantee termination. On the other hand, reduction steps are not
compatible with multiplication anymore, so that the reduction relation does not
necessarily generate a right-ideal congruence. In this thesis, several
possibilities of defining reduction relations are presented and evaluated
w.r.t. the described problems. The concept of saturation (i.e. the extension of
a set of polynomials in such a way that the right-ideal congruence it generates
can be captured by reduction) is applied to characterize Groebner bases
relatively to the different reductions by s-polynomials. Using these concepts
and special structural properties, it was possible to define special reduction
relations for special classes of monoids (e.g., finite, commutative, or free)
and for different classes of groups (e.g., finite, free, plain, context-free,
or nilpotent) and to develop terminating algorithms for computing Groebner
bases w.r.t. these reduction relations.

nonlinear codes $\mathcal C$ of kernel dimension $\kappa$ with $9\geq\kappa\geq
5$ obtained via Solov'eva-Phelps doubling construction. Each of the 361
resulting graphs has most of its nonloop edges expressible in terms of the
lexicographically disjoint quarters of the products of the components of two of
the ten 1-perfect partitions of length 8 classified by Phelps, and loops mostly
expressible in terms of the lines of the Fano plane.

novel form of superconducting state is realized in La$_{2-x}$Ba$_x$CuO$_4$ with
$x$ close to 1/8. This suggestion was based on experiments\cite{li} on this
compound which found predominantly two-dimensional (2D) characters of the
superconducting state, with extremely weak interplane coupling. Later this
specific form of superconducting state was termed striped
superconductors\cite{berg08}. The purpose of this note is to point out that the
suggested form\cite{berg} of the superconducting order parameter can be
detected directly using magnetic field modulated Josephson effect.

either symmetric or skew and k_1 + ... + k_4 = n + d. Five new Williamson
matrices over the elementary abelian groups of order 25, 27 and 49 are
constructed. New examples of skew Hadamard matrices of order 4n for n=47,61,127

family that we have constructed. An old non-published example of G-matrices of
order 37 is also included.

for efficient data processing in living beings as well as for artificial
agents. Its central feature is a general repetitive loop where one iteration
cycle sets the stage for the next. Sensory input activates data structures
(schemata) with similar constituents encountered before, thus expectations are
kindled. This corresponds to the highlighting of empty slots in the selected
schema, and these expectations are compared with the actually encountered
input. Depending on the outcome of this consumption analysis different next
steps like search for further data or a reset, i.e. a new attempt employing
another schema, are triggered. Monitoring of the whole process, and in
particular of the flow of activation directed by the consumption analysis,
yields valuable feedback for the optimum allocation of attention and resources
including the selective establishment of useful new memory entries.

spectrometer. We have searched over a range in mass from A=42 to A=70 amu for
nuclear charges 5, 6, 8, 9, and 11. No strangelets were found in the
experiment. For strangelets with nuclear charge 8, a concentration in lunar
soil higher than $10^{-16}$ is excluded at the 95% confidence level. The
implied limit on the strangelet flux in cosmic rays is the most sensitive to
date for the covered range and is relevant to both recent theoretical flux
predictions and a strangelet candidate event found by the AMS-01 experiment.

environments, optical colours, stellar masses, star formation and AGN activity
in a sample of 3003 pairs of merging galaxies drawn from the SDSS using visual
classifications from the Galaxy Zoo project. While D09a found that the
spiral-to-elliptical ratio in (major) mergers appeared higher than that of the
global galaxy population, no significant differences are found between the
environmental distributions of mergers and a randomly selected control sample.
This makes the high occurrence of spirals in mergers unlikely to be an
environmental effect and must, therefore, arise from differing time-scales of
detectability for spirals and ellipticals. We find that merging galaxies have a
wider spread in colour than the global galaxy population, with a significant
blue tail resulting from intense star formation in spiral mergers. Galaxies
classed as star-forming using their emission-line properties have average
star-formation rates approximately doubled by the merger process though star
formation is negligibly enhanced in merging elliptical galaxies. We conclude
that the internal properties of galaxies significantly affect the time-scales
over which merging systems can be detected (as suggested by recent theoretical
studies) which leads to spirals being `over-observed' in mergers. We also
suggest that the transition mass $3\times10^{10}{M}_{\astrosun}$, noted by
\citet{kauffmann1}, below which ellipticals are rare could be linked to disc
survival/destruction in mergers.
