dimensions, such as the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) model and its
higher-dimensional generalizations, where 4D gravity is mediated by massive
gravitons. The longitudinal mode of these gravitons mediates an extra scalar
force, which we model as a density-dependent modification to the Poisson
equation. This enhances gravitational clustering, particularly on scales that
have undergone mild nonlinear processing. While the standard non-linear fitting
algorithm of Smith et al. overestimates this power enhancement on non-linear
scales, we present a modified fitting formula that offers a remarkably good fit
to our power spectra. Due to the uncertainty in galaxy bias, our results are
consistent with precision power spectrum determinations from galaxy redshift
surveys, even for graviton Compton wavelengths as small as 300 Mpc. Our model
is sufficiently general that we expect it to capture the phenomenology of a
wide class of related higher-dimensional gravity scenarios.

pulsars and by annihilating or decaying dark matter in the context of recent
ATIC, PAMELA, Fermi, and HESS data. We review the flux from a single pulsar and
derive the flux from a distribution of pulsars. We point out that the particle
acceleration in the pulsar magnetosphere is insufficient to explain the
observed excess of electrons and positrons with energy E ~ 1 TeV and one has to
take into account an additional acceleration of electrons at the termination
shock between the pulsar and its wind nebula. We show that at energies less
than a few hundred GeV, the flux from a continuous distribution of pulsars
provides a good approximation to the expected flux from pulsars in the
Australia Telescope National Facility (ATNF) catalog. At higher energies, we
demonstrate that the electron/positron flux measured at the Earth will be
dominated by a few young nearby pulsars, and therefore the spectrum would
contain bumplike features. We argue that the presence of such features at high
energies would strongly suggest a pulsar origin of the anomalous contribution
to electron and positron fluxes. The absence of features either points to a
dark matter origin or constrains pulsar models in such a way that the
fluctuations are suppressed. Also we derive that the features can be partially
smeared due to spatial variation of the energy losses during propagation.

conditions, a sparse signal can be recovered from a small number of linear
incoherent measurements. An effective class of reconstruction algorithms
involve solving a convex optimization program that balances the L1 norm of the
solution against a data fidelity term. Tremendous progress has been made in
recent years on algorithms for solving these L1 minimization programs. These
algorithms, however, are for the most part static: they focus on finding the
solution for a fixed set of measurements.
  In this paper, we will discuss ""dynamic algorithms"" for solving L1
minimization programs for streaming sets of measurements. We consider cases
where the underlying signal changes slightly between measurements, and where
new measurements of a fixed signal are sequentially added to the system. We
develop algorithms to quickly update the solution of several different types of
L1 optimization problems whenever these changes occur, thus avoiding having to
solve a new optimization problem from scratch. Our proposed schemes are based
on homotopy continuation, which breaks down the solution update in a systematic
and efficient way into a small number of linear steps. Each step consists of a
low-rank update and a small number of matrix-vector multiplications -- very
much like recursive least squares. Our investigation also includes dynamic
updating schemes for L1 decoding problems, where an arbitrary signal is to be
recovered from redundant coded measurements which have been corrupted by sparse
errors.

often show the emergence of novel quantum phenomena. Much of the effort to
study these new effects, like the breakdown of the conventional Fermi-liquid
theory of metals has been focused in narrow band electronic systems.
Ferroelectric crystals provide a very different type of quantum criticality
that arises purely from the crystalline lattice. In many cases the
ferroelectric phase can be tuned to absolute zero using hydrostatic pressure or
chemical or isotopic substitution. Close to such a zero temperature phase
transition, the dielectric constant and other quantities change into radically
unconventional forms due to the quantum fluctuations of the electrical
polarization. The simplest ferroelectrics may form a text-book paradigm of
quantum criticality in the solid-state as the difficulties found in metals due
to a high density of gapless excitations on the Fermi surface are avoided. We
present low temperature high precision data demonstrating these effects in pure
single crystals of SrTiO3 and KTaO3. We outline a model for describing the
physics of ferroelectrics close to quantum criticality and highlight the
expected 1/T2 dependence of the dielectric constant measured over a wide
temperature range at low temperatures. In the neighbourhood of the quantum
critical point we report the emergence of a small frequency independent peak in
the dielectric constant at approximately 2K in SrTiO3 and 3K in KTaO3 believed
to arise from coupling to acoustic phonons. Looking ahead, we suggest that in
ferroelectric materials supporting mobile charge carriers, quantum paraelectric
fluctuations may mediate new effective electron-electron interactions giving
rise to a number of possible states such as superconductivity.

including plate motion. According to seismic tomography, the hottest area is
the mantle under the central Pacific Ocean. Combined with geomagnetic data, it
is derived that the magnetic and heat convection centers deviate from the
geographic center to the Pacific direction for 400 km. Therefore, U and Th may
be more concentrated in a position close to the equator in the lower outer core
under the central Pacific Ocean, and have formed a large U, Th-rich center
there. Another small U, Th-rich center may be located in a position close to
the equator in the lower outer core under Africa, which is directly opposite of
the large U, Th-rich center past the solid inner core. The two U, Th-rich
centers may have led to the formation of the Pacific and Africa super-plumes
and are offering energy to run the plate tectonic system. It also could have
caused the temperature of the western hemisphere to be higher than that of the
eastern hemisphere of the inner core, which may be the cause for the east-west
hemispherical elastic anisotropy of the inner core. Periodical nuclear fissions
of U and Th in the outer core may have occurred in the geological history of
the Earth, and also might have triggered geomagnetic superchrons and reversals.
At the same time, the energy released from the outer core during these events
might have also triggered strong and extensive global geological and volcanic
activities, and caused mass extinctions on the surface.

differential equations, can be used to achieve a classical superconvergence
effect. The approach is also adapted for arbitrary ODEs. Furthermore we draw a

with complex coefficients. Thereby, our main goal is to introduce a new point

their constituent particles as hard objects. The hard spheres model has been
indeed one of the cornerstones of the computational and theoretical description
in condensed matter. The next level of description is to consider particles as
rigid objects of generic shape, which would enrich the possible phenomenology
enormously. This kind of modeling will prove to be interesting in all those
situations in which steric effects play a relevant role. These include biology,
soft matter, granular materials and molecular systems. With a view to
developing a general recipe for event-driven Molecular Dynamics simulations of
hard rigid bodies, two algorithms for calculating the distance between two
convex hard rigid bodies and the contact time of two colliding hard rigid
bodies solving a non-linear set of equations will be described. Building on
these two methods, an event-driven molecular dynamics algorithm for simulating
systems of convex hard rigid bodies will be developed and illustrated in
details. In order to optimize the collision detection between very elongated
hard rigid bodies, a novel nearest-neighbor list method based on an oriented
bounding box will be introduced and fully explained. Efficiency and performance
of the new algorithm proposed will be extensively tested for uniaxial hard
ellipsoids and superquadrics. Finally applications in various scientific fields
will be reported and discussed.

states, dynamic games. These models arise in situations that involve a very
large number of agents moving from state to state according to certain
optimality criteria. The mean field approach for optimal control and
differential games (continuous state and time) was introduced by Lasry and
Lions. Here we consider a discrete version of the problem. Our setting is the
following: we assume that there is a very large number of identical agents
which can be in a finite number of states. Because the number of agents is very
large, we assume the mean field hypothesis, that is, that the only relevant
information for the global evolution is the fraction $\pi^n_i$ of players in
each state $i$ at time $n$. The agents look for minimizing a running cost,
which depends on $\pi$, plus a terminal cost $V^N$. In contrast with optimal
control, where usually only the terminal cost $V^N$ is necessary to solve the
problem, in mean-field games both the initial distribution of agents $\pi^0$
and the terminal cost $V^N$ are necessary to determine the solutions, that is,
the distribution of players $\pi^n$ and value function $V^n$, for $0\leq n\leq
N$. Because both initial and terminal data needs to be specified, we call this
problem the initial-terminal value problem. Existence of solutions is
non-trivial. Nevertheless, following the ideas of Lasry and Lions, we were able
to establish existence and uniqueness, both for the stationary and for the
initial-terminal value problems. In the last part of the paper we prove the
main result of the paper, namely the exponential convergence to a stationary
solution of $(\pi^0, V^0)$, as $N\to \infty$, for the initial-terminal value

existence of multi-TeV, stable, colour-triplet, weak-isosinglet scalars or

readily detectable if they are within the kinematic reach of a hadron collider.

  For any $\delta > 0$ there is some $N_0 \geq 1$ such that whenever $A

  Following Furstenberg and Katznelson, we first show that this result is
equivalent to a `multiple recurrence' assertion for a class of probability
measures enjoying a certain kind of stationarity. However, we then give a quite
different proof of this latter assertion through a reduction to an infinitary
removal lemma in the spirit of Tao's work on infinite random hypergraphs (and
also its recent re-interpretation in a new proof of the multidimensional
Szemeredi Theorem by the present author). This reduction is based on a
structural analysis of these stationary laws closely analogous to the classical
representation theorems for various partial exchangeable stochastic processes
in the sense of Hoover, Aldous and Kallenberg. However, the underlying
combinatorial arguments used to prove this theorem are rather different from
those required to work with exchangeable arrays, and involve crucially an
observation that arose during ongoing work by a collaborative team of authors
to give a purely finitary proof of the above theorem.

formation of a massive spheroidal galaxy we show that elliptical galaxies can
be very compact and massive at high redshift in agreement with recent
observations. Accretion of stripped in-falling stellar material increases the
size of the system with time and the central concentration is reduced by
dynamical friction of the surviving stellar cores. In a specific case of a
spheroidal galaxy with a final stellar mass of $1.5 \times 10^{11} M_{\odot}$
we find that the effective radius $r_e$ increases from $0.7 \pm 0.2 \rm kpc$ at
z = 3 to $r_e = 2.4 \pm 0.4 \rm kpc$ at z = 0 with a concomitant decrease in
the effective density of an order of magnitude and a decrease of the central
velocity dispersion by approximately 20% over this time interval. A simple
argument based on the virial theorem shows that during the accretion of weakly
bound material (minor mergers) the radius can increase as the square of the
mass in contrast to the usual linear rate of increase for major mergers. By
undergoing minor mergers compact high redshift spheroids can evolve into
present-day systems with sizes and concentrations similar to observed local
ellipticals. This indicates that minor mergers may be the main driver for the
late evolution of sizes and densities of early-type galaxies.

Phase fluctuations of the driving laser induce modulations of the linearized

both effects on cavity cooling and find that for a small laser linewidth the
dominant heating mechanism arises from intensity fluctuations. The resulting
limit on the final occupation number scales linearly with the cavity intensity
both under weak and strong coupling conditions. For the strong coupling regime,
we also determine the effect of phase noise on the coherent transfer of single
excitations between the cavity and the mechanical resonator and obtain a
similar conclusion. Our results show that conditions for optical ground state
cooling and coherent operations are experimentally feasible and thus laser
phase noise does pose a challenge but not a stringent limitation for
opto-mechanical systems.

include the up-to-date WMAP5 cosmology and other test cases based on the
Einstein-deSitter cosmology with different power spectra. We provide a robust
fitting function for the conditional mass function (CMF) of progenitor haloes
of a given halo. This fit is valid for the different cosmological models and
for different halo masses and redshifts, and it is a significant improvement
over earlier estimates. Based on this fit, we develop a simple and accurate
technique for transforming the merger history of a given simulated halo into
haloes of different mass, redshift and cosmology. Other statistics such as
main-progenitor history and merger rates are accurately transformed as well.
This method can serve as a useful tool for studying galaxy formation. It is
less sensitive to the low accuracy of the fit at small time-steps, and it can
thus replace the more elaborate task of construction Monte-Carlo realizations.
As an alternative approach, we confirm the earlier finding by Neistein & Dekel
that the main-progenitor follows a log-normal distribution. This property of
merger trees allows us to better capture their behaviour as a function of time
and descendant mass, but a broader suite of simulations is required for
evaluating the dependence of the log-normal parameters on the cosmological

Astrophysics facilities coming on line now and in the near future, we advocate
for an increased investment in applied and fundamental research on
Astrophysical and Celestial Dynamics (ACD). Specifically we call for a)
continued and expanded support for applied research in ACD, b) creation of
support for fundamental research in ACD and its subfields, and c) the creation
of a unified program to help scientists coordinate and collaborate in their
research in these fields. The benefits of this proposal are threefold. First,
it will enable researchers to interpret and understand the implications of
newly observed phenomena that will invariably arise from new facilities and
surveys. Second, research on fundamentals will foster connections between
specialists, leveraging advances found in one sub-field and making them
available to others. Third, a coordinated approach for applied and fundamental
research in ACD will help academic institutions in the United States to produce
future researchers trained and knowledgeable in essential subfields such as
Mathematical Celestial Mechanics and able to continue its advancement in
conjunction with the increase in observations.

path of nondegenerate eigenstates of a continuous family of Hamiltonians. We
introduce a method that traverses a discretized form of the path: At each step
we apply the instantaneous Hamiltonian for a random time. The resulting
decoherence approximates a projective measurement onto the desired eigenstate,
achieving a version of the quantum Zeno effect. If negative evolution times can
be implemented with constant overhead, then the average absolute evolution time
required by our method is O(L^2/Delta) for constant error probability, where L
is the length of the path of eigenstates and Delta is the minimum spectral gap
of the Hamiltonian. Making explicit the dependence on the path length is useful
for cases where L does not depend on Delta. The complexity of our method has a
logarithmic improvement over previous algorithms of this type. The same cost
applies to the discrete-time case, where a family of unitary operators is given
and each unitary and its inverse can be used. Restriction to positive evolution
times incurs an error that decreases exponentially with the cost. Applications
of this method to unstructured search and quantum sampling are considered. In
particular, we discuss the quantum simulated annealing algorithm for solving
combinatorial optimization problems. This algorithm provides a quadratic
speed-up in the gap of the stochastic matrix over its classical counterpart
implemented via Markov chain Monte Carlo.

the consequences of an inhomogeneous absorption strength? By means of
perturbation theory, exact theoretical results, and numerical simulations on

diffusing agents carrying an attribute which is stochastically destroyed upon

equation under the partially absorbing, but uniform, boundary condition
provides a starting framework in understanding detailed evolution dynamics of
the attribute in the time domain. In particular, the boundary-localized
depletion has been widely employed in practical applications that depend on
geometry of various porous media such as rocks, cement, bones, and cheese.
While direct relationship between the pore geometry and the
diffusion-relaxation spectrum forms the basis for such applications and has
been extensively studied, relatively less attention has been paid to the
spatial variation of the boundary condition. In this work, we focus on the way
the pore geometry and the inhomogeneous depletion strength of the boundary
become intertwined and thus obscure the direct relationship between the
spectrum and the geometry. It is often impossible to gauge experimentally the
degree to which such interference occur. We fill this gap by perturbatively
incorporating classes of spatially-varying boundary conditions and derive their
consequences that are observable through numerical simulations or controlled
experiments on glass bead packs and artificially fabricated porous media. We
identify features of the spectrum that are most sensitive to the inhomogeneity
and apply the method to the spherical pore with a simple hemi-spherical binary
distribution of the depletion strength and obtain bounds for the induced change

complementary nucleotides intertwine around each other, a covalently closed DNA
molecule with no interruptions in either strand can be viewed as two
interlocked single-stranded rings. Two closed space curves have long been known
by mathematicians to exhibit a property called the linking number, a
topologically invariant integer, expressible as the sum of two other
quantities, the twist of one of the curves about the other, and the writhing
number, or writhe, a measure of the chiral distortion from planarity of one of
the two closed curves. We here derive expressions for the twist of supercoiled
DNA and the writhe of a closed molecule consistent with the modern view of DNA
as a sequence of base-pair steps. Structural biologists commonly characterize
the spatial disposition of each step in terms of six rigid-body parameters, one
of which, coincidentally, is also called the twist. Of interest is the
difference in the mathematical properties between this step-parameter twist and
the twist of supercoiling associated with a given base-pair step. For example,
it turns out that the latter twist, unlike the former, is sensitive to certain
translational shearing distortions of the molecule that are chiral in nature.
Thus, by comparing the values for the two twists for each step of a
high-resolution structure of a protein-DNA complex, the nucleosome considered
here, for example, we may be able to determine how the binding of various
proteins contributes to chiral structural changes of the DNA.

reproduce the observed extinction, the model consumes the bulk of interstellar
Mg, Si, and Fe (in amorphous silicates), and a substantial fraction of C (in
carbonaceous material), with size distributions and alignment adjusted to match
observations.
  The composition, structure, and size distribution of interstellar grains is
the result of injection of dust from stellar outflows into the interstellar
medium (ISM), followed by destruction, growth, coagulation, and photoprocessing
of interstellar grains. The balance among these poorly-understood processes is
responsible for the mix of solid material present in the ISM. Most interstellar
grain material present in the diffuse ISM must be grown in the ISM. The
amorphous silicate and carbonaceous materials that form the bulk of
interstellar dust must therefore be the result of grain growth in the presence
of ultraviolet radiation. Dust in high-z systems such as J1148+5251 is also
produced primarily in the ISM, with supernova-produced dust contributing only a
small fraction of the total dust mass.

are highly reactive species that are generated photochemically and
thermochemically from H2S with peak abundances between 1-10 mbar. S2 absorbs UV
between 240 and 340 nm and is optically thick for metallicities [SH] > 0 at T >

than S2 under hot Jupiter conditions and it absorbs at somewhat redder
wavelengths. We use molecular theory to compute an HS absorption spectrum from
sparse available data and find that HS should absorb strongly between 300 and
460 nm, with absorption at the longer wavelengths being temperature sensitive.
When the two absorbers are combined, radiative heating (per kg of gas) peaks at
100 microbars, with a total stratospheric heating of about 8 x 10^4 W/m^2 for a
jovian planet orbiting a solar-twin at 0.032 AU. Total heating is insensitive

abundances for a sample of 40 S-type AGB stars based on new multi-transitional
CO and SiO radio line observations. In addition, the results are compared to
previous results for M-type AGB stars and carbon stars to look for trends with
chemical type. The circumstellar envelopes are assumed to be spherically
symmetric and formed by a constant mass-loss rate. The mass-loss rates are
estimated from fitting the CO observations using a non-local, non-LTE radiative
transfer code. Once the physical properties of the circumstellar envelopes are
determined, the same radiative transfer code is used to model the observed SiO
lines in order to derive circumstellar abundances and the sizes of the SiO
line-emitting regions. We have estimated mass-loss rates of 40 S-type AGB stars
and find that the derived mass-loss rates have a distribution that resembles
those previously derived for similar samples of M-type AGB stars and carbon
stars. The estimated mass-loss rates also correlate well with the corresponding
expansion velocity. In all, this indicates that the mass loss is driven by the
same mechanism in all three chemical types of AGB stars. In addition, we have
estimated the circumstellar fractional abundance of SiO relative to H2 in 26 of
the sample S-type AGB stars. The derived SiO abundances are, on average, about
an order of magnitude higher than predicted by stellar atmosphere thermal
equilibrium chemistry, indicating that non-equilibrium chemical processes
determines the abundance of SiO in the circumstellar envelope. Moreover, a
comparison with the results for M-type AGB stars and carbon stars show that for
a certain mass-loss rate, the circumstellar SiO abundance seems independent
(although with a large scatter) of the C/O-ratio.

the dense cores of molecular clouds. Angular momentum conservation during the
collapse results in the progressive increase of the centrifugal force, which
eventually halts the inflow of material and leads to the development of a
central mass surrounded by a disc. In the presence of an angular momentum
transport mechanism, mass accretion onto the central object proceeds through
this disc, and it is believed that this is how stars typically gain most of
their mass. However, the mechanisms responsible for this transport of angular
momentum are not well understood. The most promising are turbulence viscosity
driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI), and outflows accelerated
centrifugally from the surfaces of the disc. Both processes are powered by the
action of magnetic fields and are, in turn, likely to strongly affect the
structure, dynamics, evolutionary path and planet-forming capabilities of their
host discs. The weak ionization of protostellar discs, however, may prevent the
magnetic field from effectively coupling to the gas and drive these processes.
Here I examine the viability and properties of these magnetically driven
processes in protostellar discs. The results indicate that, despite the weak
ionization, the field is able to couple to the gas and shear for fluid
conditions thought to be satisfied over a wide range of radii in these discs.

spectroscopy to detect quasi-particle interference effects, our experiments
reveal a magnetic-field dependence in quasi-particle scattering which is
sensitive to the sign of the anisotropic gap. This result can be understood in
terms of d-wave coherence factors and it exposes the role of vortices as

networks that uses a form of cooperative diversity called opportunistic large

which limits the nodes that relay and saves as much as 32% of the transmit
energy compared to other broadcast approaches, without requiring Global
Positioning System (GPS), individual node addressing, or inter-node
interaction. This energy-saving is a result of cross-layer interaction, in the
sense that the Medium Access Control (MAC) and routing functions are partially
executed in the Physical (PHY) layer. Our proposed method is called OLA with a
transmission threshold (OLA-T), where a node compares its received power to a
threshold to decide if it should forward. We also investigate OLA with variable
threshold (OLA-VT), which optimizes the thresholds as a function of level.
OLA-T and OLA-VT are compared with OLA broadcasting without a transmission
threshold, each in their minimum energy configuration, using an analytical
method under the orthogonal and continuum assumptions. The trade-off between
the number of OLA levels (or hops) required to achieve successful network
broadcast and transmission energy saved is investigated. The results based on
the analytical assumptions are confirmed with Monte Carlo simulations.

The superwind X-ray luminosity models are an extension of the results obtained

parameterize a wide variety of effects, for instance, radiative cooling.
Additionally, X-ray properties that are valid for all bubble models taking
thermal evaporation into account are derived. The final X-ray picture is
obtained by calculating analytically the expected surface brightness and
weighted temperature of each component. All of our X-ray models have an
explicit dependence on metallicity and admit general emissivities as functions
of the hydrodynamical variables. We consider a realistic X-ray emissivity that
separates the contributions from hydrogen and metals. The paper ends with a

timed by the annual photoperiodic cycle, characterized by seasonal changes in

profile of melatonin secretion. After multiple neuronal relays (within the
hypothalamus), melatonin impacts GnRH (gonadotrophin releasing hormone)
secretion that in turn controls ovarian cyclicity. The pattern of GnRH
secretion is mirrored into that of LH (luteinizing hormone) secretion, whose
plasmatic level can be easily measured. We addressed the question of whether
there exists an endogenous circannual rhythm in a tropical sheep population
that exhibits clear seasonal ovarian activity when ewes are subjected to
temperate latitudes. We based our analysis on LH time series collected in the
course of 3 years from ewes subjected to a constant photoperiodic regime. Due
to intra- and inter- animal variability and unequal sampling times, the
existence of an endogenous rhythm is not straightforward. We have used
time-frequency signal processing methods to extract hidden rhythms from the
data. To further investigate the LF (low frequency) and HF (high frequency)
components of the signals, we have designed a mathematical model of LH
plasmatic level accounting for the effect of experimental sampling times. The
model enables us to confirm the existence of an endogenous circannual rhythm,
to investigate the action mechanism of photoperiod on the pulsatile pattern of
LH secretion (control of the interpulse interval) and to conclude that the HF

astrophysical processes. Unfortunately, only a few instruments are available
for this kind of measurements at gamma-ray energies, and the sources need to be
very bright. Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are ideal candidates due to their large
flux over limited time intervals, maximizing the available signal-to-noise
ratio. To date a few polarization measurements have been reported, claiming of
a high degree of polarization in the prompt emission of GRBs but with low
statistical evidence.
  We used the IBIS telescope on board the INTEGRAL satellite to measure the
polarization of the prompt gamma-ray emission of the long and bright GRB
041219A in the 200-800 keV energy band. We find a variable degree of
polarization ranging from less than 4% over the first peak to 43+/-25% for the
whole second peak. Time resolved analysis of both peaks indicates a high degree
of polarization, and the null average polarization in the first peak can be
explained by the rapid variations observed in the polarization angle and
degree.
  Our results are consistent with different models for the prompt emission of
GRBs at these energies, but they favor synchrotron radiation from a
relativistic outflow with a magnetic field which is coherent on an angular size
comparable with the angular size of the emitting region (~1/Gamma) . Indeed
this model has the best capabilities to maintain a high polarization level, and
to produce the observed variability.

accretion discs has been debated for more than a decade. They appear
spontaneously in several 2D disc simulations and they are known to accelerate
planetesimal formation through a dust trapping process. However, the issue of
the stability of these structures to the imposition of 3D disturbances is still
not fully understood, and it casts doubts on their long term survival.
  Aim: We present new results on the 3D stability of elliptical vortices
embedded in accretion discs, based on a linear analysis and several non-linear
simulations.
  Methods: We derive the linearised equations governing the 3D perturbations in
the core of an elliptical vortex, and we show that they can be reduced to a
Floquet problem. We solve this problem numerically in the astrophysical regime
and we present several analytical limits for which the mechanism responsible
for the instability can be explained. Finally, we compare the results of the
linear analysis to some high resolution simulations.
  Results: We show that most anticyclonic vortices are unstable due to a
resonance between the turnover time and the local epicyclic oscillation period.
In addition, we demonstrate that a strong vertical stratification does not
create any additional stable domain of aspect ratio, but it significantly
reduces growth rates for relatively weak (and therefore elongated) vortices.
  Conclusions: Elliptical vortices are always unstable, whatever the horizontal
or vertical aspect-ratio is. The instability can however be weak and is often
found at small scales, making it difficult to detect in low-order
finite-difference simulations.

No conditions on parameter identifiability are required. The parameter set can
be unbounded. (3) The model assumptions are quite general and there is no
specific structural assumptions like independence or weak dependence of
observations. The imposed conditions on the model are very mild and can be
easily checked in specific applications. (4) The established risk bounds are

result is the concentration property of the quasi MLE giving an nonasymptotic
exponential bound for the probability that the considered estimate deviates out
of a small neighborhood of the ""true"" point.

galaxy population is similar to clusters at z~1: approximately ~62% of the
galaxies identified as likely cluster members are ellipticals or S0s; and ~38%
are spirals or irregulars. We measure the color-magnitude relations for the
early type galaxies, finding that the slope in the z_850-J relation is
consistent with that measured in the Coma cluster, some ~9 Gyr earlier,
although the uncertainty is large. In contrast, the measured intrinsic scatter
about the color-magnitude relation is more than three times the value measured
in Coma, after conversion to rest frame U-V. From comparison with stellar
population synthesis models, the intrinsic scatter measurements imply mean
luminosity weighted ages for the early type galaxies in J2215.9-1738 of ~3 Gyr,
corresponding to the major epoch of star formation coming to an end at z_f =

the fraction of faint cluster members on the red sequence expressed using the

interesting. The first one combines stabilization and local controllability
near 0. The second one uses successive controls near some trajectories. We also
get a regularity result about the control if the data are assumed smoother. If
the $H^1$ norm is bounded, it gives a local control in $H^1$ with a smallness
assumption only in $L^2$. We use Bourgain spaces.

two-dimensional model porous media. For sufficiently low contact angles, the
drying pattern is fractal and can be predicted by a simple model combining the
invasion percolation model with the computation of the diffusive transport in
the gas phase. The overall drying time is minimum in this regime and is
independent of contact angle over a large range of contact angles up to the
beginning of a transition zone. As the contact angle increases in the
transition region, the cooperative smoothing mechanisms of the interface become
important and the width of the liquid gas interface fingers that form during
the evaporation process increases. The mean overall drying time increases in
the transition region up to an upper bound which is reached at a critical
contact angle \Theta_c. The increase in the drying time in the transition
region is explained in relation with the diffusional screening phenomenon
associated with the Laplace equation governing the vapor transport in the gas
phase. Above \Theta_c the drying pattern is character- ized by a flat traveling
front and the mean overall drying time becomes independent of the contact
angle. Drying time fluctuations are studied and are found to be important below
\Theta_c, i.e., when the pattern is fractal. The fluctuations are of the same
order of magnitude regardless of the value of contact angle in this range. The
fluctuations are found to die out abruptly at \Theta_c as the liquid gas
interface becomes a flat front.

attractive approach is optical actuation because light field interaction is

Following the concept of an 'optical chip' advanced from the optical actuation
of suspensions, we propose in this survey new routes to extend this concept to
microfluidic two-phase flows. First, we investigate the destabilization of
fluid interfaces by the optical radiation pressure and the formation of liquid
jets. We analyze the droplet shedding from the jet tip and the continuous
transport in laser-sustained liquid channels. In the second part, we
investigate a dissipative light-flow interaction mechanism consisting in
heating locally two immiscible fluids to produce thermocapillary stresses along
their interface. This opto-capillary coupling is implemented in adequate
microchannel geometries to manipulate two-phase flows and propose a contactless
optical toolbox including valves, droplet sorters and switches, droplet
dividers or droplet mergers. Finally, we discuss radiation pressure and
opto-capillary effects in the context of the 'optical chip' where flows,

the drop to beam radius ratio and the refractive index contrast between the two

For uniformly continuous, Lyapunov stable actions the derived invariant mean
$M(\phi_x)$ is continuous on $X$ for any element $\phi \in C(X)$, and the
induced C*-valued inner product corresponds to a conditional expectation from

shown to have the same cardinality. Stable actions on compact metric spaces

characterized by a principal quantum number, the group Casimir eigenvalue, and
one observable component of orbital angular momentum, with eigenvalue $m+s$,
for integer $m$ and real constant parameter $s$. In each symmetry group, $s$
splits the solutions into two inequivalent representations, one associated with

of one-dimensional solutions, and the other with $s>0$ (in three dimensions,
$s=0, 1/2$) whose solutions are non-separable in Cartesian coordinates, and are
hence overlooked by the standard Fock space approach. In two dimensions, a
single set of creation and annihilation operators forms a ladder representation
for the allowed oscillator states for any $s$, and the degeneracy of energy
states is always finite. However, in three dimensions, the integer and
half-integer eigenstates are qualitatively different: the former can be
expressed as finite dimensional irreducible tensors under O(3) or O(2,1), and a
ladder representation can be constructed via irreducible tensor products of the

magnetized pulsar which, due to accretion of massive clumps from the supergiant
companion donor star, undergoes sporadic changes to transient Atoll-states
where a magnetic tower can produce transient jets and as a consequence
high-energy emission. In either case (by association with 3EG J1837-0423 or

Here we present an asymptotic analysis of high-frequency acoustic modes in
rapidly rotating stars. We study the Hamiltonian dynamics of acoustic rays in
uniformly rotating polytropic stars and show that the phase space structure has
a mixed character, regions of chaotic trajectories coexisting with stable
structures like island chains or invariant tori. In order to interpret the ray
dynamics in terms of acoustic mode properties, we then use tools and concepts
developed in the context of quantum physics. Accordingly, the high-frequency
acoustic spectrum is a superposition of frequency subsets associated with
dynamically independent phase space regions. The sub-spectra associated with
stable structures are regular and can be modelled through EBK quantization
methods while those associated with chaotic regions are irregular but with
generic statistical properties. The results of this asymptotic analysis are
successfully confronted with the properties of numerically computed
high-frequency acoustic modes. The implications for the asteroseismology of
rapidly rotating stars are discussed.

J174540.0-290031, the stellar cluster IRS 13, as well as self-annihilating dark
matter. It is experimentally very challenging to further improve the positional
accuracy in this energy range and therefore, it may not be possible to clearly
associate one of the counterpart candidates with the VHE-source. Here, we
present a new method to investigate a possible link of the VHE-source with the
near environment of Sgr A* (within approximately 1000 Schwarzschild radii).
This method uses the time- and energy-dependent effect of absorption of
gamma-rays by pair-production (in the following named pair-eclipse) with
low-energy photons of stars closely orbiting the SMBH Sgr A*.

the following: {\it A $\calc^2$ - diffeomorphism $F:U'\to U$ (where $U',
U\subset \cc^n$ are domains) sends convex hypersurfaces to pseudoconvex ones if

providing tag suggestions, or recommendations, based on a popularity
measurement of tags other users provided when tagging the same resource. In
this paper we investigate the influence of tag suggestions on the emergence of
power law distributions as a result of collaborative tag behavior. Although
previous research has already shown that power laws emerge in tagging systems,
the cause of why power law distributions emerge is not understood empirically.
The majority of theories and mathematical models of tagging found in the
literature assume that the emergence of power laws in tagging systems is mainly
driven by the imitation behavior of users when observing tag suggestions
provided by the user interface of the tagging system. This imitation behavior
leads to a feedback loop in which some tags are reinforced and get more popular
which is also known as the `rich get richer' or a preferential attachment
model. We present experimental results that show that the power law
distribution forms regardless of whether or not tag suggestions are presented
to the users. Furthermore, we show that the real effect of tag suggestions is
rather subtle; the resulting power law distribution is `compressed' if tag
suggestions are given to the user, resulting in a shorter long tail and a
`compressed' top of the power law distribution. The consequences of this
experiment show that tag suggestions by themselves do not account for the
formation of power law distributions in tagging systems.

presented, where the only sources of flavor breaking at low energy are the up

expansion: linear MFV, where it is truncated at the leading terms, and
nonlinear MFV, where such a truncation is not possible due to large third
generation Yukawa couplings. These are then resummed to all orders using
non-linear sigma-model techniques familiar from models of collective breaking.
Generically, flavor diagonal CP violating (CPV) sources in the UV can induce
O(1) CPV in processes involving third generation quarks. Due to a residual U(2)
symmetry, the extra CPV in B_d-\bar B_d mixing is bounded by CPV in B_s-\bar
B_s mixing. If operators with right-handed light quarks are subdominant, the
extra CPV is equal in the two systems, and is negligible in processes involving
only the first two generations. We find large enhancements in the up type
sector, both in CPV in D-\bar D mixing and in top flavor violation.
