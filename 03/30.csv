decline branch of their light curves. We use visual observations to study this
phase in several well-observed novae. We find that these rebrightenings are
isolated flare-like events on otherwise smooth light curves and we show that in
most novae in our sample the time intervals between consecutive flares
gradually increase as a geometric series; rebrightenings are equally spaced in
logarithmic time. We also find a correlation between the rate of increase in
the time between rebrightenings with the speed class of the nova in the sense
that slower novae tend to increase the time intervals faster. We attribute
these rebrightenings to instabilities in the envelope hydrogen burning and we
mention other cases of such timing pattern in astronomy and natural sciences in
general.

Fe II emission and its correlation with other emission lines and physical
parameters of active galactic nuclei. We find that the strongest correlations
of almost all the emission-line intensity ratios and equivalent widths (EWs)
are with the Eddington ratio (L/L_{Edd}), rather than with the continuum
luminosity at 5100\AA\ (L_{5100}) or black hole mass (M_{BH}); the only
exception is the EW of ultraviolet Fe II emission, which does not correlate at
all with broad-line width, L_{5100}, M_{BH}, or L/L_{Edd}. By contrast, the
intensity ratios of both the ultraviolet and optical Fe II emission to Mg II
\lambda 2800 correlate quite strongly with L/L_{Edd}. Interestingly, among all
the emission lines in the near-UV and optical, the EW of narrow optical Fe II
emission has the strongest correlation with L/L_{Edd}. We suggest that the
variation of the emission-line strength in active galaxies is regulated by
L/L_{Edd} because it governs the global distribution of the column density of
the clouds gravitationally bound in the line-emitting region, as well as its
overall gas supply. The systematic dependence on L/L_{Edd} must be corrected
when using the FeII/MgII intensity ratio as a measure of the Fe/Mg abundance
ratio to study the history of chemical evolution in QSO environments.

B-decays and interpret them in terms of generic contributions to effective
Wilson coefficients. The effects we focus on are: the differences in the fitted
value of sin(2 beta) versus the ones directly measured via the time dependent
CP asymmetries in B -> J/psi K or via B -> (phi,eta') K; the difference between
the direct CP asymmetries in B- -> K- pi0 and B0 -> K- pi+ and the ~2.2 sigma
indications for the CP-asymmetry in Bs -> J/psi phi. To alleviate concerns
regarding the disagreement between inclusive and exclusive Vub, we show that
our results hold even without the inclusion of Vub in the analysis. We find
that no matter what kind of new physics (NP) is invoked to explain these
effects, its effective scale is bounded from above from a few hundred GeV to a
few TeV depending on specific assumptions regarding the type of new physics.
The only exception to this is when the NP contribution is assumed to reside
entirely in LR operators in K mixing, then the scale of NP can be as high as
around 24 TeV; however, this case cannot account for CP asymmetry in Bs ->
J/psi phi or a difference in sin(2 beta) from penguin modes compared to that
from J/psi K or for that matter the large difference seen between direct CP
asymmetries in K- pi+ and in K- pi0.

given by a Hamiltonian function which is a sum of the standard kinetic energy
and a homogeneous polynomial potential $V$ of degree $k>2$. The well known
Morales-Ramis theorem gives the strongest known necessary conditions for the
Liouville integrability of such systems. It states that for each $k$ there
exists an explicitly known infinite set $\scM_k\subset\Q$ such that if the
system is integrable, then all eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix $V''(\vd)$
calculated at a non-zero $\vd\in\C^n$ satisfying $V'(\vd)=\vd$, belong to
$\scM_k$. The aim of this paper is, among others, to sharpen this result. Under
certain genericity assumption concerning $V$ we prove the following fact. For
each $k$ and $n$ there exists a finite set $\scI_{n,k}\subset\scM_k$ such that
if the system is integrable, then all eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix
$V''(\vd)$ belong to $\scI_{n,k}$. We give an algorithm which allows to find
sets $\scI_{n,k}$. We applied this results for the case $n=k=3$ and we found
all integrable potentials satisfying the genericity assumption. Among them
several are new and they are integrable in a highly non-trivial way. We found
three potentials for which the additional first integrals are of degree 4 and 6
with respect to the momenta.

is a self-consistent and completely deterministic one without any stochastic

changes in measurement units. Nevertheless, the model explains between 65% and
95% of the variability in unemployment and inflation. For Italy, the rate of
unemployment is predicted at a time horizon of nine years with pseudo
out-of-sample root-mean-square forecasting error of 0.55% for the period

static and dynamic properties of dilute polymer solutions. The first approach
is a recently established hybrid algorithm based upon dissipative coupling
between Molecular Dynamics and lattice Boltzmann (LB), while the second is
standard Brownian Dynamics (BD) with fluctuating hydrodynamic interactions.
Applying these methods to the same physical system (a single polymer chain in a
good solvent in thermal equilibrium) allows us to draw a detailed and
quantitative comparison in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. It is found
that the static conformations of the LB model are distorted when the box length
L is too small compared to the chain size. Furthermore, some dynamic properties
of the LB model are subject to an $L^{-1}$ finite size effect, while the BD
model directly reproduces the asymptotic $L \to \infty$ behavior. Apart from
these finite size effects, it is also found that in order to obtain the correct
dynamic properties for the LB simulations, it is crucial to properly thermalize
all the kinetic modes. Only in this case, the results are in excellent
agreement with each other, as expected. Moreover, Brownian Dynamics is found to
be much more efficient than lattice Boltzmann as long as the degree of
polymerization is not excessively large.

admits a nonzero solution of equation $V'(\vd)=0$. The existence of such
solution gives very strong integrability obstructions obtained in the frame of
the Morales-Ramis theory. This theory gives also additional integrability
obstructions which have the form of restrictions imposed on the eigenvalues
$(\lambda_1,...,\lambda_n)$ of the Hessian matrix $V''(\vd)$ calculated at a
non-zero $\vd\in\C^n$ satisfying $V'(\vd)=\vd$. Furthermore, we show that

multivariable residue calculus. We demonstrate the strength of the obtained
results analysing in details the nongeneric cases for $n=k=3$. Our analysis
cover all the possibilities and we distinguish those cases where known methods
are too weak to decide if the potential is integrable or not. Moreover, for

He finds a decretion disk, about ten times denser than the well-known Hayashi

However, a planet in a protoplanetary disk migrates. In a massive, long-lived
disk, this question has to be addressed. With numerical simulations, we show
that the four giant planets of the Solar System could not survive in this disk.
In particular, Jupiter enters the type III, runaway regime, and falls into the

elementary considerations, which also leads to a criterion of thermal stability
of radiant black holes, without resorting to specific classical metrics. For
black holes that obey this criterion, the canonical entropy is expressed in
terms of the microcanonical entropy of an Isolated Horizon which is essentially
a local generalization of the very global event horizon and is a null inner
boundary of spacetime, with marginal outer trapping. It is argued why degrees
of freedom on this horizon must be described by a topological gauge theory.
Quantizing this boundary theory leads to the microcanonical entropy of the

nutrients into cells and metabolites into the environment. Each simulation step
requires the integration of nonlinear differential equations that describe the
individual cell's clockwork and the integration of the diffusion equations.
These integrations are carried out under widely different conditions, in a
changing environment, and for this reason they need integrators that are both
unconditionally stable and that do not display unwanted algorithmic artifacts.
These conditions are not always fulfilled in the existing literature, and we

systems where each subsystem can have different degrees of freedom (so-called
qudits). One set, called 'separability' measure, reveals which of the
subsystems are separable/entangled. For that we have to extend the concept of
k-separability for multipartite systems to a novel unambiguous separability
concept which we call \gamma_k-separability. The second set of entanglement
measures reveals the 'kind' of entanglement, i.e. if it is bipartite,
tripartite, ..., n-partite entangled and is denoted as the 'physical' measure.
We show how lower bounds on both sets of measures can be obtained by the
observation that any entropy may be rewritten via operational expressions known
as m-concurrences. Moreover, for different classes of bipartite or multipartite
qudit systems we compute the bounds explicitly and discover that they are often
tight or equivalent to positive partial transposition (PPT).

help identify the active mode that maximizes the average sum throughput for

solvent-mediated attraction and repulsion is described by an extension of the
Onsager theory for rigid rods. A phenomenological square-well potential is used
to model these long-range interactions, and the model is used to compute phase
separation and length fractionation as a function of well depth and rod
concentration. The model closely captures experimental data points for
isotropic/liquid crystalline phase coexistence of single-walled carbon
nanotubes (SWNTs) in superacids. The model also predicts that the
isotropic-biphasic boundary approaches zero as acid strength diminishes, with
the possibility of coexistence of isotropic and liquid crystalline phases at
very low concentrations; this counterintuitive prediction is confirmed
experimentally. Experimental deviations from classical theories for rodlike
liquid crystals are explained in terms of polydispersity and the balance
between short range repulsion and long range attractions. The predictions of
the model also hold practical import for applications of SWNT/superacid
solutions, particularly in the processing of fibers and films from liquid
crystalline SWNT/superacid mixtures.

survey covered a 0.66 sq. deg. region close to the Galactic Plane (b=11 deg.)
and monitored a total of 110,372 stars (15.0<V<22.0). Using difference imaging
photometry, 16,134 light curves with a photometric precision of sigma<0.025 mag
were obtained. These light curves were searched for transits, and four
candidates were detected that displayed low-amplitude variability consistent
with a transiting giant planet. Further investigations, including spectral
typing and radial velocity measurements for some candidates, revealed that of
the four, one is a true planetary companion (Lupus-TR-3), two are blended
systems (Lupus-TR-1 and 4), and one is a binary (Lupus-TR-2). The results of
this successful survey are instructive for optimizing the observational
strategy and follow-up procedure for deep searches for transiting planets,
including an upcoming survey using the SkyMapper telescope at SSO.

interested in maximizing his own payoff, does any equilibrium exist for the
society? John Nash proved more than 50 years ago that an equilibrium always
exists such that nobody would benefit from unilaterally changing his strategy.
Nash Equilibrium is a central concept in game theory, which offers a
mathematical foundation for social science and economy. However, it is
important from both a theoretical and a practical point of view to understand
game playing where individuals are less selfish. This paper offers a
constructive generalization of Nash equilibrium to study n-person games where
the selfishness of individuals can be defined at any level, including the
extreme of complete selfishness. The generalization is constructive since it
offers a protocol for individuals in a society to reach an equilibrium. Most
importantly, this paper presents experimental results and theoretical
investigation to show that the individuals in a society can reduce their
selfishness level together to reach a new equilibrium where they can have
better payoffs and the society is more stable at the same time. This study
suggests that, for the benefit of everyone in a society (including the
financial market), the pursuit of maximal payoff by each individual should be
controlled at some level either by voluntary good citizenship or by imposed
regulations.

tangent bundles of two smooth manifolds $M$ and $\widetilde M$, respectively.
In this paper we characterize those diffeomorphisms $F\colon TM\setminus\{0\}
\to T\widetilde M\setminus\{0\}$ that can be written as $F =
(D\phi)|_{TM\setminus\{0\}}$ for a diffeomorphism $\phi\colon M\to \wt M$. When
$F = (D\phi)|_{TM\setminus\{0\}}$ one say that $F$ \emph{descends}. If $M$ is
equipped with two sprays, we use the characterization to derive sufficient
conditions that imply that $F$ descends to a totally geodesic map. Specializing
to Riemann geometry we also obtain sufficient conditions for $F$ to descent to
an isometry.

stellar atmosphere- and internal structure-models of massive and intermediate
mass objects at different evolutionary phases. However, these Teff values are
more or less discrepant depending on the method used to determine them. We aim
to obtain a new calibration of the Teff parameter for early-type supergiants as
a function of observational quantities that are highly sensitive to the
ionization balance in the photosphere and its gas pressure, independent of the
interstellar extinction, and as much as possible model-independent. The
observational quantities that best address our aims are the (lambda1, D)
parameters of the BCD spectrophotometric system. They describe the energy
distribution around the Balmer discontinuity, which is highly sensitive to Teff
and logg. We perform a calibration of the (lambda1, D) parameters into Teff
using effective temperatures derived with the bolometric-flux method for 217
program stars, whose individual absolute relative uncertainties are on average
0.05. The final comparison of calculated with obtained Teff values in the
(lambda1,D) calibration further show that the latter have total relative
uncertainties, which on average are of the order of 0.05 for all spectral types
and luminosity classes. The effective temperatures of OB supergiants derived in
this work agree on average within some 2000 K with other determinations found
in the literature, except those issued from wind-free non-LTE plane-parallel
models of stellar atmospheres, which produce effective temperatures that can be
overestimated by up to more than 5000 K near Teff = 25000 K.

chosen connected vertices in the network, as well as for the number of edges on
the least weight path, the so-called hopcount. We analyze the configuration
model with degree power-law exponent $\tau>2$, in which the degrees are assumed
to be i.i.d. with a tail distribution which is either of power-law form with
exponent $\tau-1>1$, or has even thinner tails ($\tau=\infty$). In this model,
the degrees have a finite first moment, while the variance is finite for
$\tau>3$, but infinite for $\tau\in(2,3)$. We prove a central limit theorem for
the hopcount, with asymptotically equal means and variances equal to
$\alpha\log{n}$, where $\alpha\in(0,1)$ for $\tau\in(2,3)$, while $\alpha>1$
for $\tau>3$. Here $n$ denotes the size of the graph. For $\tau\in (2,3)$, it
is known that the graph distance between two randomly chosen connected vertices
is proportional to $\log \log{n}$ [Electron. J. Probab. 12 (2007) 703--766],
that is, distances are ultra small. Thus, the addition of edge weights causes a
marked change in the geometry of the network. We further study the weight of
the least weight path and prove convergence in distribution of an appropriately
centered version. This study continues the program initiated in [J. Math. Phys.
49 (2008) 125218] of showing that $\log{n}$ is the correct scaling for the
hopcount under i.i.d. edge disorder, even if the graph distance between two
randomly chosen vertices is of much smaller order. The case of infinite mean
degrees ($\tau\in[1,2)$) is studied in [Extreme value theory,
Poisson--Dirichlet distributions and first passage percolation on random
networks (2009) Preprint] where it is proved that the hopcount remains
uniformly bounded and converges in distribution.

have already peaked and that we are currently witnessing its slowing down. The

Moreover, archival FIR Spitzer/MIPS maps were combined with the LABOCA map to
distinguish between pre- and protostellar cores, and to estimate the
evolutionary stages of protostars. Twelve dense cores were detected at 870
micron in the Ori B9 cloud. The submm cores constitute ~4% of the total mass of
the Ori B9 region. There is an equal number of pre- and protostellar cores. Two
of the submm sources, which we call SMM 3 and SMM 4, are previously unknown
Class 0 candidates. We found a moderate degree of deuteration in N2H+
(0.03-0.04). There is, furthermore, evidence for N2H+ depletion in the core SMM
4. We derive a relatively high degree of ionization (~10^-7) in the clump
associated with IRAS 05405-0117. The ambipolar diffusion timescales for two of
the cores are ~70-100 times longer than the free-fall time. The distribution
and masses of dense cores in Ori B9 are similar to those observed in more
active regions in Orion, where the statistical core properties have been
explained by turbulent fragmentation. The 50/50 proportions of pre- and
protostellar cores suggest that duration of the prestellar phase is comparable
to the free-fall time. This timescale can be questioned, however, on the basis
of chemical data on the IRAS 05405-0117 region. A possible explanation is that
this survey samples only the densest, i.e., dynamically most advanced cores.

light curve of the star recorded in the year 2003 as double hump periodic
variations with an amplitude of ~7 mmag.
  In the year 2004 the signal was also present in only a subsection of the
light curve. In that year, the system was about twice as bright and the
amplitude of the oscillations was about half of what it was in 2003. In 2004
the cycle structure was of a single hump, the phase of which coincided with the
phase of one of the humps in the 2003 cycle. No periodic signal was detected in
a third, short series of observations performed in the year 2007, when the star
was three magnitudes brighter than in 2003.
  We interpret the periodicity as the spin period of the white dwarf component
of this interacting binary system. We suggest that the signal in 2003
originated in two hot spots on or near the surface of the white dwarf, most
likely around the two antipodes of an oblique dipole magnetic field of this
star. Magnetic field lines funneled accreted matter from the wind of the cool
component to the pole areas, where the falling material created the hot spots.
This process is apparently intermittent in its nature. In 2004, the activity
near only one pole was enhanced enough to raise the signal above the threshold
of our detection ability.

Einstein's field equations which are well posed and preserve constraints and
gauge conditions, the question of geometric uniqueness remains unresolved. For
two different approaches we discuss how this difficulty arises under general
assumptions. So far it is not known whether it can be overcome without imposing
conditions on the geometry of the boundary. We point out a natural and
important class of initial boundary value problems which may offer
possibilities to arrive at a fully covariant formulation.

propose some procedures related to it. Then we introduce a set of possible

on Simes' critical values, whereby certain types of dependency are allowed.
This methodology of proof is then applied to other fixed rejection curves
including the proposed new curve. Among others, we investigate the problem of
finding least favorable parameter configurations such that the FDR becomes
largest. We then derive a series of results concerning asymptotic FDR control
for procedures based on the new curve and discuss several example procedures in
more detail. A main result will be an asymptotic optimality statement for
various procedures based on the new curve in the class of fixed rejection
curves. Finally, we briefly discuss strict FDR control for a finite number of
hypotheses.

derived. New fluctuating forces appear as compared with the elastic limit. The
particular case of the transverse velocity field is investigated in detail. Its
fluctuations can be described by means of a Langevin equation, but exhibiting
two main differences with the Landau-Lifshitz theory: the noise is not white,

the fluctuation-dissipation relations for molecular fluids do not
straightforwardly carry over to inelastic gases. The theoretical predictions
are shown to be in good agreement with molecular dynamics simulation results.

stronger than the universal gravity. Beside sterinos and sterons, the

variability properties for a large sample of black hole X-ray binary systems.
This is done to test, refine and extend -- notably into the timing properties
-- the previously published `unified model' for the coupling of accretion and
ejection in such sources. In 14 outbursts from 11 different sources we find
that in every case the peak radio flux, on occasion directly resolved into
discrete relativistic ejections, is associated with the bright hard to soft
state transition near the peak of the outburst. We also note the association of
the radio flaring with periods of X-ray flaring during this transition in most,
but not all, of the systems. In the soft state, radio emission is in nearly all
cases either undetectable or optically thin, consistent with the suppression of
the core jet in these states and `relic' radio emission from interactions of
previously ejected material and the ambient medium. However, these data cannot
rule out an intermittent, optically thin, jet in the soft state. In attempting
to associate X-ray timing properties with the ejection events we find a close,
but not exact, correspondence between phases of very low integrated X-ray
variability and such ejections. In summary we find no strong evidence against
the originally proposed model, confirming and extending some aspects of it with
a much larger sample, but note that several aspects remain poorly tested.

  For this purpose we have parsed all sentences of a corpus and have generated

properties of the DPCM system have been unravelled, which cannot be observed
and explained if the nonlinearity of the quantizer is neglected. For the
purposes of this study, a piece-wise linear nondifferentiable quantizer
characteristic is considered. The resulting model of the DPCM is of the form of
iteration equations (i.e. map), where the inverse iterate is not unique (i.e.
noninvertible map). Therefore the mathematical theory of noninvertible maps is
particularly suitable for this analysis, together with the more classic tools
of Non Linear Dynamics. This study allowed us in addition to show from a
theoretical point of view some new properties of nondifferentiable maps, in
comparison with differentiable ones. After a short review of noninvertible
maps, the presented methods and tools for noninvertible maps are applied to the
DPCM system. An original algorithm for calculation of bifurcation curves for
the DPCM map is proposed. Via the studies in the parameter and phase plane,
different nonlinear phenomena such as the overlapping of bifurcation curves
causing multistability, chaotic behaviour, or multiple basins with fractal
boundary are pointed out. All observed phenomena show a very complex dynamical
behaviour even in the constant input signal case, discussed here.

of large initial data generating a global smooth solution to the three
dimensional, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. This data varies slowly in
the vertical direction (is a function on $\epsilon x_3$) and has a norm which
blows up as the small parameter goes to zero. This type of initial data can be
seen as the ""ill prepared"" case (in opposite with the ""well prepared"" case
which was treated previously by J.-Y. Chemin and I. Gallagher). In that paper,
the fluid evolves in a special domain, namely $\Omega=T^2_h\times\R_v$. The
choice of a periodic domain in the horizontal variable plays an important role.
The aim of this article is to study the case where the fluid evolves in the
full spaces $\R^3$, case where we need to overcome the difficulties coming from
very low horizontal frequencies. We consider in this paper an intermediate
situation between the ""well prepared"" case and ""ill prepared"" situation (the
norms of the horizontal components of initial data are small but the norm of
the vertical component blows up as the small parameter goes to zero). The proof
uses the analytical-type estimates and the special structure of the nonlinear

modification prior to the transition. Before showing this, we have widened the
parameters range for the observation of the transition. We had shown before
that the two structures can be formed depending on chain length (for a given
[PSS]/[lysozyme] ratio): gel for large chains, globules for short chains. We
show here that the crossover between these two regimes can also be reached as a
function of chains concentration or salinity of the buffer. Since all these
crossover parameters act on chains overlapping concentration c*, we reinforce
the idea of a transition from the dilute to the semi-dilute regime, but c* is
shifted compared to pure PSS solutions. In order to understand this, we have
measured by SANS the conformation of a single chain of PSS in presence of
proteins within the complexes. This is achieved by a specific labeling trick
where we take advantage of the fact that lysozyme and hydrogenated PSS chains
have the same neutron scattering length density. In the gel structure, the PSS
chains keep a wormlike structure as in pure solutions, but their persistence
length is strongly reduced, from 50 {\AA} without proteins to 20 {\AA} in
average with lysozyme. With this value of 20 {\AA}, we calculate new
overlapping thresholds (concentration, mass, ionic strength) in agreement with
observed ones. In a second stage, after the globular structure is formed, the
PSS chains get a third conformation, no longer wormlike, but more collapsed,
within the globules.

  Geographical Data Networks",,,,,"cs.CG cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Large scale decentralized communication systems have introduced the new trend
towards online routing where routing decisions are performed based on a limited
and localized knowledge of the network. Geometrical greedy routing has been
among the simplest and most common online routing schemes. A perfect
geometrical routing scheme is expected to deliver each packet to the point in
the network that is closest to the packet destination. However greedy routing
fails to guarantee such delivery as the greedy forwarding decision sometimes
leads the packets to localized minimums. This article investigates the
necessary and sufficient properties of the greedy supporting graphs that
provide the guaranteed delivery of packets when acting as a routing substrate.

a separable t-matrix approach. For the scalar quark-quark correlation we

fermionization and find that the Hamiltonian takes a BCS type form, allowing
the system to be solved by Bogoliubov transformation. Our fermionization does
not employ non-physical auxiliary degrees of freedom and the eigenstates we
obtain are completely explicit in terms of the spin variables. The ground-state
is obtained as a BCS condensate of fermion pairs over a vacuum state which
corresponds to the toric code state with the same vorticity. We show in detail
how to calculate all eigenstates and eigenvalues of the model on the torus. In
particular, we find that the topological degeneracy on the torus descends
directly from that of the toric code, which now supplies four vacua for the
fermions, one for each choice of periodic vs. anti-periodic boundary
conditions. The reduction of the degeneracy in the non-Abelian phase of the
model is seen to be due to the vanishing of one of the corresponding candidate
BCS ground-states in that phase. This occurs in particular in the fully
periodic vortex-free sector. The true ground-state in this sector is exhibited
and shown to be gapped away from the three partially anti-periodic
ground-states whenever the non-Abelian phase is gapped.

investigate the spectral characteristics of GRB 061122. A search for linear
polarisation in the prompt emission was carried out using the SPI multiple
event data in the energy range 100 keV-1 MeV.
  The prompt spectrum was best fit by a combination of a blackbody and a
power--law model (the quasithermal model), with evidence for high energy
emission continuing above 8 MeV. A pseudo-redshift value of pz = 0.95 +/- 0.18
was determined using the spectral fit parameters. The isotropic energy at this
pseudo-redshift is 8.5 x 10^{52} erg. The jet opening angle was estimated to be
smaller than 2.8 deg or larger than 11.9 deg from the X-ray lightcurve. An
upper limit of 60% polarisation was determined for the prompt emission of GRB
061122, using the multiple event data.
  The high energy emission observed in the spectrum may be due to the reverse
shock interacting with the GRB ejecta when it is decelerated by the circumburst
medium. This behaviour has been observed in a small fraction of GRBs to date,
but is expected to be more commonly observed by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space
Telescope. The conditions for polarisation are met if the jet opening angle is
less than 2.8 deg, but further constraints on the level of polarisation are not
possible.

~ 1.25 - 1.3 applying from groups to rich clusters, yields our radial
\alpha-profiles. In the ICP the entropy run k(r) is mainly shaped by shocks, as
steadily set by supersonic accretion of gas at the cluster boundary, and
intermittently driven from the center by merging events or by AGNs; the
resulting equilibrium is described by the exact yet simple formalism
constituting our ICP Supermodel. With a few parameters, this accurately
represents the runs of density n(r) and temperature T(r) as required by recent
X-ray data on surface brightness and spectroscopy for both cool core (CC) and
non cool core (NCC) clusters; the former are marked by a middle temperature
peak, whose location is predicted from rich clusters to groups. The Supermodel
inversely links the inner runs of n(r) and T(r), and highlights their central
scaling with entropy n_c ~ k_c^-1 and T_c ~ k_c^0.35, to yield radiative
cooling times t_c ~ 0.3 (k_c/15 keV cm^2)^1.2 Gyr. We discuss the stability of
the central values so focused either in CC and NCC clusters. From the
Supermodel we derive as limiting cases the classic polytropic \beta-models, and
the `mirror' model with T(r) ~ \sigma^2(r) suitable for NCC and CC clusters,
respectively; these highlight how the ICP temperature T(r) tends to mirror the
DM velocity dispersion \sigma^2(r) away from entropy injections. Finally, we

argue that this hypothesis implies knees that scale with the atomic mass for
the different nuclei, as KASKADE data seem to indicate. We find that to explain
the change in the spectral index in the flux from E^{-2.7} to E^{-3.1} the
cross section must grow like E^{0.4+\beta} above the knee, where \beta=0.3-0.6
parametrizes the energy dependence of the age (\tau \propto E^{-\beta}) of the

sections (that could be modelled with TeV gravity) and large densities of dark
matter (that could be clumped around the sources of cosmic rays). We argue that
neutrinos would also exhibit a threshold at E=(m_\chi/m_p)E_{knee}\approx 10^8
GeV where their interaction with a nucleon becomes strong. Therefore, the
observation at ICECUBE or ANITA of standard neutrino events above this

  Scopus","9 pages, 6 figures",,"10.1002/asi.21062",,"cs.IR cs.DL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For more than 40 years, the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI, now
part of Thomson Reuters) produced the only available bibliographic databases
from which bibliometricians could compile large-scale bibliometric indicators.
ISI's citation indexes, now regrouped under the Web of Science (WoS), were the
major sources of bibliometric data until 2004, when Scopus was launched by the
publisher Reed Elsevier. For those who perform bibliometric analyses and
comparisons of countries or institutions, the existence of these two major
databases raises the important question of the comparability and stability of
statistics obtained from different data sources. This paper uses macro-level
bibliometric indicators to compare results obtained from the WoS and Scopus. It
shows that the correlations between the measures obtained with both databases
for the number of papers and the number of citations received by countries, as
well as for their ranks, are extremely high (R2 > .99). There is also a very
high correlation when countries' papers are broken down by field. The paper
thus provides evidence that indicators of scientific production and citations
at the country level are stable and largely independent of the database.

in contemporary scientific discoveries and statistical research. Among others,
Fan and Lv [J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B Stat. Methodol. 70 (2008) 849-911] propose
an independent screening framework by ranking the marginal correlations. They
showed that the correlation ranking procedure possesses a sure independence
screening property within the context of the linear model with Gaussian
covariates and responses. In this paper, we propose a more general version of
the independent learning with ranking the maximum marginal likelihood estimates
or the maximum marginal likelihood itself in generalized linear models. We show
that the proposed methods, with Fan and Lv [J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B Stat.
Methodol. 70 (2008) 849-911] as a very special case, also possess the sure
screening property with vanishing false selection rate. The conditions under
which the independence learning possesses a sure screening is surprisingly
simple. This justifies the applicability of such a simple method in a wide
spectrum. We quantify explicitly the extent to which the dimensionality can be
reduced by independence screening, which depends on the interactions of the
covariance matrix of covariates and true parameters. Simulation studies are
used to illustrate the utility of the proposed approaches. In addition, we
establish an exponential inequality for the quasi-maximum likelihood estimator
which is useful for high-dimensional statistical learning.
