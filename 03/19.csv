the Universe may be Dark Stars (DS), powered by dark matter heating rather than
by nuclear fusion, and in this paper we examine the history of these DS. The
power source is annihilation of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs)
which are their own antiparticles. These WIMPs are the best motivated dark
matter (DM) candidates and may be discovered by ongoing direct or indirect
detection searches (e.g. FERMI /GLAST) or at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.
A new stellar phase results, powered by DM annihilation as long as there is DM
fuel, from millions to billions of years. We build up the dark stars from the
time DM heating becomes the dominant power source, accreting more and more
matter onto them. We have included many new effects in the current study,
including a variety of particle masses and accretion rates, nuclear burning,
feedback mechanisms, and possible repopulation of DM density due to capture.
Remarkably, we find that in all these cases, we obtain the same result: the
first stars are very large, 500-1000 times as massive as the Sun; as well as
puffy (radii 1-10 A.U.), bright ($10^6-10^7 L_\odot$), and cool ($T_{surf} <
$10,000 K) during the accretion. These results differ markedly from the
standard picture in the absence of DM heating. Hence DS should be
observationally distinct from standard Pop III stars. In addition, DS avoid the
(unobserved) element enrichment produced by the standard first stars. Once the
dark matter fuel is exhausted, the DS becomes a heavy main sequence star; these
stars eventually collapse to form massive black holes that may provide seeds
for the supermassive black holes and intermediate black holes, and explain
ARCADE data.

interferometer such as used in recent experimental studies of the fractional
quantum Hall plateau at filling fraction nu=5/2. We compare the predictions of
several different models of the state of the electrons at this plateau: the
Moore-Read, anti-Pfaffian, SU(2)_2 NAF, K=8 strong pairing, and (3,3,1) states.
All of these predict the existence of charge e/4 quasiparticles, but the first
three are non-Abelian while the last two are Abelian. We give explicit formulas
for the scaling of charge e/2 and charge e/4 quasiparticle contributions to the
current as a function of temperature, gate voltage and distance between the two
point contacts for all three models. Based on these, we analyze several
possible explanations of two phenomena reported for recent experiments by
Willett et al., namely halving of the period of the observed resistance
oscillations with rising temperature and alternation between the same two
observed periods at low temperatures as the area of the interference loop is
varied with a side gate. We conclude that the most likely explanation is that
the observed alternation is due to switching between even and odd numbers of
charge e/4 quasiparticles enclosed within the loop as a function of side gate
voltage, which is a clear signature of the presence of non-Abelian anyons.
However, there are important features of the data which do not have a simple
explanation within this picture. We suggest further experiments which could
help rule out some possible scenarios. We make the corresponding predictions
for future tunneling and interference experiments at the other observed second
Landau level fractional quantum Hall states.

objects, unifying the study of diverse phenomena including biological organisms
and human society. One crucial step when studying the structure and dynamics of
networks is to identify communities: groups of related nodes that correspond to
functional subunits such as protein complexes or social spheres. Communities in
networks often overlap such that nodes simultaneously belong to several groups.
Meanwhile, many networks are known to possess hierarchical organization, where
communities are recursively grouped into a hierarchical structure. However, the
fact that many real networks have communities with pervasive overlap, where
each and every node belongs to more than one group, has the consequence that a
global hierarchy of nodes cannot capture the relationships between overlapping
groups. Here we reinvent communities as groups of links rather than nodes and
show that this unorthodox approach successfully reconciles the antagonistic
organizing principles of overlapping communities and hierarchy. In contrast to
the existing literature, which has entirely focused on grouping nodes, link
communities naturally incorporate overlap while revealing hierarchical
organization. We find relevant link communities in many networks, including
major biological networks such as protein-protein interaction and metabolic
networks, and show that a large social network contains hierarchically
organized community structures spanning inner-city to regional scales while
maintaining pervasive overlap. Our results imply that link communities are
fundamental building blocks that reveal overlap and hierarchical organization
in networks to be two aspects of the same phenomenon.

active galactic nuclei (AGN) events. We have explored the PDR chemistry for a
range of physical conditions representing a variety of galaxy types. Our main
result is a demonstration of the sensitivity of the chemistry to changes in the
physical conditions. We adopt crude estimates of relevant physical parameters

from that which we recommended for use in galaxies with embedded massive stars.
Thus, molecular observations can in principle be used to distinguish between

are intended to be useful in preparing Herschel and ALMA proposals to identify

quasi-two-dimensional organic Mott insulator
$\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Cl both under moderate pressure and at
ambient-pressure conditions. When pressurized, the system can be shifted to the
inhomogeneous coexistence region of antiferromagnetic insulating and
superconducting phases, where percolation effects dominate the electronic
fluctuations [J. M\""uller {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 102}, 047004
(2009)]. Independent of the pressure conditions, at higher temperatures we
observe generic $1/f^\alpha$-type spectra. The magnitude of the electronic
noise is extremely enhanced compared to typical values of homogeneous
semiconductors or metals. This indicates that a highly inhomogeneous current
distribution may be an intrinsic property of organic charge-transfer salts. The
temperature dependence of the nearly $1/f$ spectra can be very well described
by a generalized random fluctuation model [Dutta, Dimon, and Horn, Phys. Rev.\
Lett. {\bf 43}, 646 (1979)]. We find that the number of fluctuators and/or
their coupling to the electrical resistance depends on the temperature, which
possibly relates to the electronic scattering mechanisms determining the
electrical resistance. The phenomenological model explains a pronounced peak
structure in the low-frequency noise at around 100 K, which is not observed in
the resistivity itself, in terms of the thermally-activated conformational
degrees of freedom of the ET molecules' ethylene endgroups.

sequence of $n$ terms from the cyclic group $C_n$ such that all (nontrivial)
zero-sum subsequences have the same length, then $S$ must contain at most two
distinct terms. In 1976, Erd\H{o}s and Szemeredi gave a proof of the conjecture
for sufficiently large primes $n$. However, the proof was complicated enough
that the details for small primes were never worked out. Both in the paper of
Erd\H{o}s and Szemeredi and in a later survey by Erd\H{o}s and Graham, the
complexity of the proof was lamented. Recently, a new proof, valid even for
non-primes $n$, was given by Gao, Hamidoune and Wang, using Savchev and Chen's
recently proved structure theorem for zero-sum free sequences of long length in
$C_n$. However, as this is a fairly involved result, they did not believe it to
be the simple proof sought by Erd\H{o}s, Graham and Szemeredi. In this paper,
we give a short proof of the original conjecture that uses only the
Cauchy-Davenport Theorem and pigeonhole principle, thus perhaps qualifying as a
simple proof. Replacing the use of the Cauchy-Davenport Theorem with the
Devos-Goddyn-Mohar Theorem, we obtain an alternate proof, albeit not as simple,
of the non-prime case. Additionally, our method yields an exhaustive list
detailing the precise structure of $S$ and works for an arbitrary finite
abelian group, though the only non-cyclic group for which this is nontrivial is
$C_2\oplus C_{2m}$.

(Probabilistic Inference for ChIP-seq) for extracting information from ChIP-seq
aligned-read data in order to identify regions bound by transcription factors.
PICS identifies enriched regions by modeling local concentrations of
directional reads, and uses DNA fragment length prior information to
discriminate closely adjacent binding events via a Bayesian hierarchical
t-mixture model. Its per-event fragment length estimates also allow it to
remove from analysis regions that have atypical lengths. PICS uses
pre-calculated, whole-genome read mappability profiles and a truncated
t-distribution to adjust binding event models for reads that are missing due to
local genome repetitiveness. It estimates uncertainties in model parameters
that can be used to define confidence regions on binding event locations and to
filter estimates. Finally, PICS calculates a per-event enrichment score
relative to a control sample, and can use a control sample to estimate a false
discovery rate. We compared PICS to the alternative methods MACS, QuEST, and
CisGenome, using published GABP and FOXA1 data sets from human cell lines, and
found that PICS' predicted binding sites were more consistent with
computationally predicted binding motifs.

also study deviations from Keplerian motion due to frame dragging, the
gravitational multipole moments of the sun, a possible net electric charge on
the sun, and a positive cosmological constant. The presence of the SRP tends to
increase these deviations by several orders of magnitude, possibly rendering
some of them detectable. As for non-circular bound orbits, the SRP dampens the
rate at which the perihelion is shifted due to curved spacetime, while the
perihelion shift due to the oblateness of the sun is increased. With regards to
the Lense-Thirring effect, the SRP increases the angle of precession of polar
orbits during one orbital period, although the precession frequency is not
actually altered. We also consider non-Keplerian orbits, which lie outside of

relativistic effects, and the oblateness of the sun. Non-Keplerian orbits
exhibit an analog of the Lense-Thirring effect, in that the orbital plane

  changes",,,,"math.QA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We discuss the axioms for vertex algebras and their modules, using formal
calculus. Following certain standard treatments, we take the Jacobi identity as
our main axiom and we recall weak commutativity and weak associativity. We
derive a third, companion property that we call ""weak skew-associativity."" This
third property in some sense completes an $\mathcal{S}_{3}$-symmetry of the
axioms, which is related to the known $\mathcal{S}_{3}$-symmetry of the Jacobi
identity. We do not initially require a vacuum vector, which is analogous to
not requiring an identity element in ring theory. In this more general setting,
one still has a property, occasionally used in standard treatments, which is
closely related to skew-symmetry, which we call ""vacuum-free skew-symmetry."" We
show how certain combinations of these properties are equivalent to the Jacobi
identity for both vacuum-free vertex algebras and their modules. We then
specialize to the case with a vacuum vector and obtain further replacement
axioms. In particular, in the final section we derive our main result, which
says that, in the presence of certain minor axioms, the Jacobi identity for a
module is equivalent to either weak associativity or weak skew-associativity.
The first part of this result has previously appeared and been used to show the
(nontrivial) equivalence of representations of and modules for a vertex
algebra. Many but not all of our results appear in standard treatments; some of
our arguments are different from the usual ones.

an interplay between exogenous influences and an endogenous organization. We
use a simple (ETAS) model of events occurring sequentially, in which future
events are influenced (partially triggered) by past events to ask the question
of how well can one disentangle the exogenous events from the endogenous ones.
We apply both model-dependant and model-independent stochastic declustering
methods to reconstruct the tree of ancestry and estimate key parameters. In
contrast with previously reported positive results, we have to conclude that
declustered catalogs are rather unreliable for the synthetic catalogs that we
have investigated, which contains of the order of thousands of events, typical
of realistic applications. The estimated rates of exogenous events suffer from
large errors. The key branching ratio $n$, quantifying the fraction of events
that have been triggered by previous events, is also badly estimated in general
from declustered catalogs. We find however that the errors tend to be smaller
and perhaps acceptable in some cases for small triggering efficiency and
branching ratios. The high level of randomness together with the very long
memory makes the stochastic reconstruction of trees of ancestry and the
estimation of the key parameters perhaps intrinsically unreliable for long
memory processes. For shorter memories (larger ""bare"" Omori exponent), the
results improve significantly.

study other quiver gauge theories corresponding to more complicated orbifolds

explicitly evaluate them for an initial state with the atom in its bare ground
state and the field in the vacuum state. We show that the results can be
physically interpreted as the superposition of the fields propagating directly
from the atom and the fields reflected on the wall. Relativistic causality in
the field propagation is discussed. Finally we apply these results to the
calculation of the dynamical Casimir-Polder interaction energy in the far zone
between two atoms when a boundary condition such as a conducting wall is
present. Magnetic contributions to the interatomic Casimir-Polder interaction
in the presence of the wall are also considered. We show that, in the limit of
large times, the known results of the stationary case are recovered.

estimate the necessary sensitivity for detecting low density WHIM gas with the
South Pole Telescope (SPT) and Planck Surveyor for a synthetic 100 square
degree sky survey. This survey is generated from a very large, high dynamic
range adaptive mesh refinement cosmological simulation performed with the Enzo

factor of 2-4), the WHIM gas makes a detectable contribution to the integrated
sky signal. For a Planck-like satellite, similar detections are possible with a
more significant increase in sensitivity (a factor of 8-10). We point out that
for the WHIM gas, the kinematic SZE signal can sometimes dominate the thermal
SZE where the thermal SZE decrement is maximal (150 GHz), and that using the
combination of the two increases the chance of WHIM detection using SZE
surveys. However, we find no evidence of unique features in the thermal SZE
angular power spectrum that may aid in its detection. Interestingly, there are
differences in the power spectrum of the kinematic SZE, which may not allow us
to detect the WHIM directly, but could be an important contaminant in
cosmological analyses of the kSZE-derived velocity field. Corrections derived
from numerical simulations may be necessary to account for this contamination.

explores possible kinematic signatures produced by asphericity and departures
from initial virial equilibrium in these systems. Specifically, the kinematic
quantity that is measured and calculated in this study is the distribution of
the line-of-sight velocities as a function of position along the cluster.
Although clusters are found within a wide range of sizes, we focus on the
regime with stellar membership $N \sim 10^3$. The gravitational potential of
these young clusters is dominated by the gas, and the geometry of the gas
distribution is generalized to include axisymmetric (and triaxial) forms. With
this loss of symmetry, the kinematic results thus depend on viewing angle. This
work also considers the stars to begin their trajectories with subvirial
speeds, as indicated by observations of core motions in such clusters. Our
results determine the conditions necessary for the kinematic signature to
display interesting structure, i.e., a non-spherical potential, a viewing angle
that is not along one of the principal axes, and subvirial starting conditions.
We characterize the effects on this signature due to projection angle, initial
stellar velocities, cluster elongation, and star formation efficiency. Finally,
we compare our theoretical results to recent kinematic observations of the
Orion Nebula Cluster; we find that the observations can be explained provided
that the cluster is non-spherical, starts with subvirial initial velocities,
and is not viewed along a principal axis.

remaining dataset is a major challenge in real-world KDD applications. Existing
outlier detection methods are ineffective on scattered real-world datasets due
to implicit data patterns and parameter setting issues. We define a novel
""Local Distance-based Outlier Factor"" (LDOF) to measure the {outlier-ness} of
objects in scattered datasets which addresses these issues. LDOF uses the
relative location of an object to its neighbours to determine the degree to
which the object deviates from its neighbourhood. Properties of LDOF are
theoretically analysed including LDOF's lower bound and its false-detection
probability, as well as parameter settings. In order to facilitate parameter
settings in real-world applications, we employ a top-n technique in our outlier
detection approach, where only the objects with the highest LDOF values are
regarded as outliers. Compared to conventional approaches (such as top-n KNN
and top-n LOF), our method top-n LDOF is more effective at detecting outliers
in scattered data. It is also easier to set parameters, since its performance
is relatively stable over a large range of parameter values, as illustrated by
experimental results on both real-world and synthetic datasets.

giant branches, with the densest fields also showing evidence for prominent red
clumps. We use the Dartmouth isochrones to construct metallicity distribution
functions (MDFs) which confirm the presence of dominant populations with
<[Fe/H]> = -0.6 to -1.0 dex and considerable metallicity dispersions of 0.2 to
0.3 dex (assuming a 10 Gyr population and scaled-Solar abundances). The average
metallicity over the range 30 - 60 kpc is [Fe/H] = -0.8 +/- 0.14 dex, with no
evidence for a significant radial gradient. Metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] <= -1.3)

wire-tapper has the worst channel. We establish the capacity region of this

Gaussian codes and randomization within the layers which we will refer to as
Secret Superposition Coding. For the outerbound, we use the notion of enhanced
channel to show that the secret superposition of Gaussian codes is optimal. We
show that we only need to enhance the channels of the legitimate receivers, and
the channel of the eavesdropper remains unchanged. Then we extend the result of
the degraded case to non-degraded case. We show that the secret superposition
of Gaussian codes along with successive decoding cannot work when the channels
are not degraded. we develop a Secret Dirty Paper Coding (SDPC) scheme and show
that SDPC is optimal for this channel. Finally, we investigate practical
characterizations for the specific scenario in which the transmitter and the
eavesdropper have multiple antennas, while both intended receivers have a
single antenna. We characterize the secrecy capacity region in terms of
generalized eigenvalues of the receivers channel and the eavesdropper channel.
We refer to this configuration as the MISOME case. In high SNR we show that the
capacity region is a convex closure of two rectangular regions.

possibility of fast reconnection events in the solar environment for very large

fundamental solitary waves of nonlinear Hamiltonian equations. The main
obstacle that such a modified CGM overcomes is that the operator of the
equation linearized about a solitary wave is not sign definite. Instead, it has
a finite number of eigenvalues on the opposite side of zero than the rest of
its spectrum. We present versions of the modified CGM that can find solitary
waves with prescribed values of either the propagation constant or power. We
also extend these methods to handle multi-component nonlinear wave equations.
Convergence conditions of the proposed methods are given, and their practical

transfer operators arise for a wide range of stochastic processes, ranging from
random walks on infinite graphs to the processes that govern signals and

each case, there is an associated class of harmonic functions which we study.
And in addition, we study three questions in depth:
  In specific applications, and for a specific stochastic process, how do we
realize the transfer operator $T$ as an operator in a suitable Hilbert space?
And how to spectral analyze $T$ once the right Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ has
been selected? Finally we characterize the stochastic processes that are
governed by a single transfer operator.
  In our applications, the particular stochastic process will live on an
infinite path-space which is realized in turn on a state space $S$. In the case
of random walk on graphs $G$, $S$ will be the set of vertices of $G$. The
Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ on which the transfer operator $T$ acts will then
be an $L^{2}$ space on $S$, or a Hilbert space defined from an energy-quadratic
form.
  This circle of problems is both interesting and non-trivial as it turns out
that $T$ may often be an unbounded linear operator in $\mathcal{H}$; but even
if it is bounded, it is a non-normal operator, so its spectral theory is not
amenable to an analysis with the use of von Neumann's spectral theorem. While
we offer a number of applications, we believe that our spectral analysis will
have intrinsic interest for the theory of operators in Hilbert space.

First, it is pointed out that for ground states, the nonuniqueness of the

spin density s(r) in spin-polarized density functional theory implies the
nonexistence of the derivative of the SDFT Lieb functional with respect to N_s.

is investigated. From a tight-binding perspective, applying a Fourier-Floquet
transformation and renormalization process, we observe that graphene
-intrinsically anisotropic- reveals field polarization signatures in the
quasi-density of states. For the ac field polarized along the armchair
direction, the dressed electronic structure shows an emergent property: an ac
field induced quantum ring. This is inferred by the orientation-dependent
formation of a miniband of energy states periodically modulated with increasing
magnetic field, exactly analogous to the behavior of a quantum ring spectrum.

we show that a third of the users who can be verified to have accounts on both
Twitter, a popular microblogging service, and Flickr, an online photo-sharing

rate.
  Our de-anonymization algorithm is based purely on the network topology, does
not require creation of a large number of dummy ""sybil"" nodes, is robust to
noise and all existing defenses, and works even when the overlap between the
target network and the adversary's auxiliary information is small.

utilization in the future wireless networks. The flexible spectrum management
provides new opportunities for licensed primary user and unlicensed secondary
users to reallocate the spectrum resource efficiently. In this paper, we
present an oligopoly pricing framework for dynamic spectrum allocation in which
the primary users sell excessive spectrum to the secondary users for monetary
return. We present two approaches, the strict constraints (type-I) and the QoS
penalty (type-II), to model the realistic situation that the primary users have
limited capacities. In the oligopoly model with strict constraints, we propose
a low-complexity searching method to obtain the Nash Equilibrium and prove its
uniqueness. When reduced to a duopoly game, we analytically show the
interesting gaps in the leader-follower pricing strategy. In the QoS penalty
based oligopoly model, a novel variable transformation method is developed to
derive the unique Nash Equilibrium. When the market information is limited, we
provide three myopically optimal algorithms ""StrictBEST"", ""StrictBR"" and
""QoSBEST"" that enable price adjustment for duopoly primary users based on the
Best Response Function (BRF) and the bounded rationality (BR) principles.
Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our analysis and demonstrate
the fast convergence of ""StrictBEST"" as well as ""QoSBEST"" to the Nash
Equilibrium. For the ""StrictBR"" algorithm, we reveal the chaotic behaviors of
dynamic price adaptation in response to the learning rates.

The fractal-Einstein and Alexander-Orbach laws, which interrelate electrical,

settle a long standing controversy about their exactness by showing that the
properties of a class of fractal trees violate both laws. A new formula is
derived which unifies the two classical results by proving that if one holds,

physical atom can be obtained as the negative of the total contribution of low
energy states and continuum unoccupied states. We calculate this in framework
of the quantum defect number. The approach allows us to see that the dominant
intrashell correlation is going to be cancelled. We can also obtain some limits
on the correlation effects by considering calculations with the screened
Coulomb functions. The role of correlations in the exclusive photoionization
processes is discussed.

Detector yielded a significant detection in the super-hard (15--50 keV) band,
which is uncontaminated by near-by sources. We constrained the temperature of
the optically-thin thermal plasma emission dominant in the hard band as 3--4
keV using the K-shell line features with the XIS. We found significant excess
emission above the thermal emission in the super-hard band with the PIN,
confirming the previous INTEGRAL ISGRI report. The entire 5--50 keV spectra
were fitted by a combination of a thermal plasma model plus a flat power-law or
a very hot thermal bremsstrahlung model for the excess emission. No significant
change of the excess emission was found at different epochs within the
systematic and statistical uncertainties and no flare-like flux amplification
was seen in the hard band, indicating that the excess emission is a steady
phenomenon. We argue that the super-hard emission is attributable to the
inverse Compton of stellar UV photons by non-thermal electrons or to the
thermal bremsstrahlung of very hot plasma, and not to the bremsstrahlung by
non-thermal electrons colliding with cold ambient matter.

pattern and area of the tree-fall and trees' scorching by heat radiation, etc.)
allow a simple solution within the New Explosive Cosmogony (NEC) of minor
bodies, as opposed to other approaches. The NEC considers the short-period (SP)
comet nuclei, to which the Tunguska body belonged, to be fragments produced in
explosions of massive icy envelopes of Ganymede-type bodies saturated by
products of bulk electrolysis of ices to the form of a 2H2+O2 solid solution.
The nearly tangent entry into the Earth's atmosphere with V~20 km/s of such a
nucleus, ~200-500 m in size and ~(5-50)x10^12 g in mass, also saturated by
2H2+O2, initiated detonation of its part of ~10^12 g at an altitude of 5-10 km.
This resulted in deflection of this fraction trajectory by 5^o-10^o, and fast
expansion with ~2 km/s of its detonation products brought about their fast
slowing down by the air, heating of the latter to T>10^4 K and a phenomenon of
high-altitude explosion. On crossing the Earth's atmosphere, the main part of
the unexploded nucleus escaped into space, and this body moving presently in an
SP orbit should eventually be identified in time. Its impact with W~250-3000 Mt
TNT on the Earth's surface (which could occur in 1908) would have produced a
crater up to ~3.5-8 km in size, with an ejection of dust that would have
brought about a climatic catastrophe. The processes involved in the TP are
resembling those accompanying falling P/Shoemaker-Levy 9 onto Jupiter and,

arbitrary $t$-qubit errors involving $3(t+1)$ qubits, e.g., 6 qubits suffice to
tolerate single qubit errors. Secondly we construct also a
single-error-tolerating Bell inequality with a violation that increases
exponentially with the number of qubits. Exhaustive computer search for optimal
error-tolerating Bell inequalities based on graph states on no more than 10
qubits shows that our constructions are optimal for single- and double-error
tolerance.

analogous to Maxwell's relations in ordinary thermodynamics. From these

the Kerr-Newman spacetime. We extend our method to find the corrected entropy
of stationary black holes in (3+1) dimensions. For that we first calculate the
corrected Hawking temperature considering both scalar particle and fermion
tunneling beyond the semiclassical approximation. Using this corrected Hawking
temperature we compute the corrected entropy, based on properties of exact
differentials. The connection of the coefficient of the leading (logarithmic)
correction with the trace anomaly of the stress tensor is established . We
explicitly calculate this coefficient for stationary black holes with various

the two-channel/terminal Kondo model at the Toulouse point as well as of a
resonant level between two half-infinite Tomonaga--Luttinger liquids. We
analyze the time evolution of the electric current and of the population
function after an instantaneous switching on of the tunneling coupling. We find
that the only timescale, which governs the relaxation of the initial dot
preparation is the inverse contact transparency $\Gamma$, whatever the dot
offset energy $\Delta$, applied bias voltage or temperature. The voltage alone
determines the superimposed oscillatory behavior of the observables for weak
detuning $|\Delta|<\Gamma/2$. In the opposite case of strong detuning
$|\Delta|>\Gamma/2$ a beating pattern emerges. For the current the finite
temperature plays the similar role as the hybridization. The dot population
function dynamics approaches that of a resonant ($\Delta=0$) setup upon
increasing the voltage or/and temperature.

known. However, few models satisfactorily resolve the core problem of allowing
both the source and receiving divisions to earn a profit on transfers during a
period in such a way that sub-optimal output levels are avoided. In 1969,
Samuel proposed to use a transfer price schedule instead of just a single
transfer price. An essential improvement of Samuels' model was given by Tomkins
(1990) in his pragmatic-analytical transfer pricing approach, which is a
combination of a single cost-plus transfer price and the pragmatic process of
negotiation. This fundamental approach was developed under the assumption that
the net average revenue curve for the final product is linear.
  In this paper, Tomkins' pragmatic-analytical model is further developed for
non-linear net average revenue curves. In particular, typical quadratic
functions are considered and corresponding transfer price schedules are
determined. A similar technique can be used for the transfer pricing problem
with any net average revenue curve.

both attractive and repulsive interactions. Moreover, our study of the
interconversion between dimers and Efimov trimers shows that $B_{2}+B_{2}\to

mechanism. Our analysis of the temperature dependence of this reaction provides
an interpretation of the available experimental data and sheds light on the

voltage bias and express it via the cumulant generating function of noise. In
the large-bias regime, high-order cumulants of current add up to cancel the
dilution effect of a QPC. This leads to an abrupt change in the dependence of
the visibility on voltage bias which occurs at the QPC's transparency T=1/2.

taken using the FIS instrument on the Akari satellite. We compare these data to
submillimetre data taken using the SCUBA camera on the JCMT, and far-infrared
data taken with the ISOPHOT camera on board the ISO satellite. All of the data
show a relation between the position of the peak of emission and the wavelength
for the core of L1155. We interpret this as a temperature gradient. We fit
modified blackbody curves to the spectral energy distributions at two positions
in the core and see that the central core in L1155 (L1155C) is approximately 2
degrees warmer at one edge than it is in the centre. We consider a number of
possible heating sources and conclude that the A6V star BD+67 1263 is the most
likely candidate. This star is at a distance of 0.7 pc from the front of L1155C
in the plane of the sky. We carry out radiative transfer modelling of the
L1155C core including the effects from the nearby star. We find that we can
generate a good fit to the observed data at all wavelengths, and demonstrate
that the different morphologies of the core at different wavelengths can be
explained by the observed 2 degree temperature gradient. The L1148 core
exhibits a similar morphology to that of L1155C, and the data are also
consistent with a temperature gradient across the core. In this case, the most
likely heating source is the star BD197053. Our findings illustrate very
clearly that the apparent observed morphology of a pre-stellar core can be
highly dependent on the wavelength of the observation, and that temperature
gradients must be taken into account before converting images into column
density distributions. This is important to note when interpreting Akari and
Spitzer data and will also be significant for Herschel data.

presence of both a large-scale velocity and non-uniform magnetic field. By
assuming a turbulence driven by an external forcing with both helical and
non-helical spectra, we investigate the combined effect of these two shears on
turbulence intensity and turbulent transport represented by turbulent
diffusivities (turbulent viscosity, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ effect) in analogy
with Reynolds. We show that turbulence viscosity and diffusivity are quenched
for strong flow shear and magnetic field in the limits of weak and strong
magnetic field, respectively. For a weak flow shear, we further show that the
magnetic shear increases the turbulence intensity while decreasing the
turbulent transport. In the presence of a strong flow shear, the effect of the
magnetic shear is found to oppose the effect of flow shear (which reduces
turbulence due to shear stabilization) by enhancing turbulence and transport,
thereby weakening the strong quenching by flow shear stabilization. In the case
of a strong magnetic field (compared to flow shear), magnetic shear increases
turbulence intensity and quenches turbulent transport.
