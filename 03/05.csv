practically unchanged. This suggests a more intrinsic origin, such as the
increased importance of surface tension at small dimensions. The effect of

M_sun/yr and for Mkn 104, it is 0.02 M_sun/yr. A U-B vs V-I colour-colour mixed
population model is created using the Starburst99 evolutionary model curves.
The spectrum of the bright star forming knot of I Zw 97 does not show any
strong signature of an underlying relatively older stellar population, but the
U-B vs V-I two colour diagram indicates a strong contribution of a ~500 Myr
population. The age of the underlying population of Mkn 104 using the U-B vs

profile of both the galaxies can be represented well by a two-component Sersic
profile consisting of a near exponential distribution and a Gaussian nuclear
starburst. I Zw 97 is a cometary blue compact dwarf galaxy where the underlying
low surface brightness (LSB) galaxy is a dwarf irregular observed during a
major stochastic enhancement of its otherwise moderate star formation activity.
Both these galaxies are very similar in their stellar content, showing an older
4 Gyr population, an intermediate 500 Myr population and the current burst of
star formation of age 5-13 Myr.

reservoir is derived from the homogenization theory. The governing equations on
the microscopic level consist of the stationary Stokes system for an
incompressible viscous fluid, occupying a crack-pore space (liquid domain), and
stationary Lame equations for an incompressible elastic solid skeleton, coupled
with corresponding boundary conditions on the common boundary ""solid
skeleton-liquid domain"". We suppose that the liquid domain is a union of two
independent systems of cracks (fissures) and pores, and that the dimensionless
size $\delta$ of pores depends on the dimensionless size $\varepsilon$ of
cracks: $\delta=\varepsilon^{r}$ with $r>1$. The rigorous justification is
fulfilled for homogenization procedure as the dimensionless size of the cracks
tends to zero, while the solid body is geometrically periodic. As the result we
derive the well-known Biot -- Terzaghi system of liquid filtration in
poroelastic media, which consists of the usual Darcy law for the liquid in
cracks coupled with anisotropic Lame's equation for the common displacements in
the solid skeleton and in the liquid in pores and a continuity equation for the
velocity of a mixture. The proofs are based on the method of reiterated
homogenization, suggested by G. Allaire and M. Briane. As a consequence of the

only the mutual distances between them. The basic idea in this letter is to use
distance geometry for thermodynamics studies of small clusters in the

shown to explain some characteristic features of the caloric curve in very
small clusters containing 3 or 4 atoms. We anticipate that this approach could
give a novel insight into the phase transitions in larger clusters as well.
During these studies, we have established a very general and rather simple
result for the Jacobian determinant of the change of variables from Cartesian
coordinates to mutual distances, which is of wide applicability in the N-body

  Minimal Model","22 pages, 9 fig",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Main characteristics of colloidal systems that develop fluid phases with
different mechanical properties, namely shear-banding fluids, are briefly
reviewed both from experimental and theoretical (modelling) point of view. A
non-monotonic shear stress vs. shear rate constitutive relation is presented.
This relation derives from a phenomenological model of a shear ratedependent
viscosity describing structural changes and involves the possibility of
multivalued shear rates under a given shear stress. In the case of a
stress-dependent viscosity, the same model allows one to predict vorticity
banding. Predictions of this model under controlled stress are discussed,
namely occurrence of a kind of top- and bottom-jumping of the shear rate in
response to stress increasing-decreasing. Applying this model to evaluation of
the flow curve of such colloidal systems is performed. Particular emphasis is
placed on the adequate computation of the shear rate function in cylindrical
Couette cells in order to handle the corresponding flow curve which exhibits
the well-known shear stress plateau. Indeed, as different fluid phases coexist
in the flow domain, measured (torque vs. angular velocity) data cannot be
directly converted into rheometric (shear stress vs. shear rate) functions. As
the lacking non-local terms in the model prevents the direct determination of
the stress-plateau, this value is included as an adjustable parameter. Thus
model predictions satisfactorily match up experimental data of wormlike
micellar solutions from the literature.

  Homogenization",,,,,"math.AP physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Double porosity models for the liquid filtration in an absolutely rigid body
is derived from homogenization theory. The governing equations of the fluid
dynamics on the microscopic level consist of the Stokes system for a slightly
compressible viscous fluid, occupying a crack -- pore space. In turn, this
domain is a union of two independent systems of cracks (fissures) and pores. We
suppose that the dimensionless size $\delta$ of pores depends on the
dimensionless size $\varepsilon$ of cracks: $\delta=\varepsilon^{r}$ with
$r>1$. The rigorous justification is fulfilled for homogenization procedure as
the dimensionless size of the cracks tends to zero, while the solid body is
geometrically periodic. As a result, for the long-time process we derive the
usual Darcy equations of filtration for the liquid in cracks, while the liquid
in pores is blocked and unmoved. For the short-time processes the homogenized
system consists of acoustic equations, describing a two-velocity continuum with
three independent parameters: the liquid velocity in pores, the liquid velocity
in cracks and the common pressure. The proofs are based on the method of
reiterated homogenization, suggested by G. Allaire and M. Briane.

does $\V$ admit a $T$-invariant non-degenerate symmetric (resp. skew-symmetric)
bilinear form? We also answer the infinitesimal version of this question.
  Following Feit-Zuckerman \cite{fz}, an element $g$ in a group $G$ is called
real if it is conjugate in $G$ to its own inverse. So it is important to
characterize real elements in $\G(\V, \F)$. As a consequence of the answers to
the above question, we offer a characterization of the real elements in $\G(V,
\F)$.
  Suppose $\V$ is equipped with a non-degenerate symmetric (resp.
skew-symmetric) bilinear form $B$. Let $S$ be an element in the isometry group
$I(\V, B)$. A non-degenerate $S$-invariant subspace $\W$ of $(\V, B)$ is called
orthogonally indecomposable with respect to $S$ if it is not an orthogonal sum
of proper $S$-invariant subspaces. We classify the orthogonally indecomposable
subspaces. This problem is nontrivial for the unipotent elements in $I(\V, B)$.
The level of a unipotent $T$ is the least integer $k$ such that $(T-I)^k=0$. We
also classify the levels of unipotents in $I(\V, B)$.

addition to an already high activity level, Vela X-1 exhibited several very
intense flares with a maximum intensity of more than 5 Crab in the 20-40 keV
band. Furthermore Vela X-1 exhibited several off states where the source became
undetectable with ISGRI. We interpret flares and off states as being due to the
strongly structured wind of the optical companion: when Vela X-1 encounters a
cavity in the wind with strongly reduced density, the flux drops, thus
potentially triggering the onset of the propeller effect which inhibits further
accretion, thus giving rise to the off states. The required drop in density to
trigger the propeller effect in Vela X-1 is of the same order as predicted by
theoretical papers for the densities in the OB star winds. The same structured
wind can give rise to the giant flares when Vela X-1 encounters a dense blob in
the wind. Further temporal analysis reveals that a short lived QPO with a
period of ~6800 sec is present. The part of the light curve during which the
QPO is present is very close to the off states and just following a high
intensity state, thus showing that all these phenomena are related.

within the concept of the defect model for the mixed mobile ion effect (V.
Belostotsky, J. Non-Cryst. Solids 353 (2007) 1078) is reported. It is shown
that in a mixed ionic conductor (e.g., mixed alkali glass) containing two or
more types of dissimilar mobile ions of unequal size sufficient local strain
arising from the size mismatch of a mobile ion entering a foreign site can not
be, in principle, absorbed by the surrounding network-forming matrix without
its damage. Primary site rearrangement occurs immediately, on the time scale
close to that of the ion migration process, through the formation of intrinsic
defects in the nearest glass network. Neither anelastic relaxation below glass
transition temperature, Tg, nor viscoelastic or viscous behavior at or above Tg
can be expected being observed in this case because the character of the stress
relaxation in a wide temperature range is dictated above all by the deformation
rates employed locally to the adjacent network-forming matrix. Since the ion
migration occurs on the picosecond time scale, the primary rearrangement of the
glass network adjacent to an ionic site occurs at rates orders of magnitude
higher than those of the critical minimum values, so the matrix demonstrates
brittle-elastic response to the arising strain even at temperatures well above
Tg, which explains, among other things, why mixed alkali effect is observable
in glass melts.

been proposed for one of the brown dwarfs, 2MASS J1207334$-$393254, because of
its similarities to higher mass T Tauri stars as manifested in accretion and
the presence of a jet. We do not find clear evidence for a kilo-Gauss field in
any of our young brown dwarfs but do find a 2 kG field on the young VLM star.
Our 3-$\sigma$ upper limit for the magnetic flux in 2MASS J1207334$-$393254
just reaches 1 kG. We estimate the magnetic field required for accretion in
young brown dwarfs given the observed rotations, and find that fields of only a
few hundred Gauss are sufficient for magnetospheric accretion. This predicted
value is less than our observed upper limit. We conclude that magnetic fields
in young brown dwarfs are a factor of five or more lower than in young stars of
about one solar mass, and in older stars with spectral types similar to our
young brown dwarfs. It is interesting that, during the first few million years,
the fields scale down with mass in line with what is needed for magnetospheric
accretion, yet no such scaling is observed at later ages within the same
effective temperature range. This scaling is opposite to the trend in rotation,
with shorter rotation periods for very young accreting brown dwarfs compared
with accreting solar-mass objects (and very low Rossby numbers in all cases).
We speculate that in young objects a deeper intrinsic connection may exist
between magnetospheric accretion and magnetic field strength, or that magnetic
field generation in brown dwarfs may be less efficient than in stars. Neither
of these currently have an easy physical explanation.

spiral-shaped structure surrounding MWC 778, with arms that extend beyond 6"" on

  Although MWC 778 has previously been classified as an Herbig Ae/Be star, the

presence of metallic absorption lines in the optical spectrum, which implies
that MWC 778 may belong to the fairly rare class of Intermediate-Mass T Tauri

Yet its integrated bolometric luminosity, > 750 L_sun (for an assumed distance
of 1 kpc) is surprisingly high for an F or G spectral type, even for an IMTTS.
We speculate on several possible explanations for this discrepancy, including
its true distance being much closer than 1 kpc, the presence of a binary
companion, and/or a non-stellar origin for the observed absorption lines.

particles in the limit of small super-saturation. The new element is an
effective initial condition that follows from the initial exhaustion of
nucleation as described in a previous paper [Farjoun and Neu, Phys. Rev. E 78].
The effective initial condition is characterized by a narrow distribution of
cluster-sizes, all much larger than critical. In the subsequent solution, one
of the LS similarity solutions emerges as the long-time limit, as expected. But
our solution tells more. In particular, there is a ""growth"" era prior to what
is usually called ""coarsening"". During ""growth"" the clusters (all of nearly the
same size much larger than critical) eventually exhaust the super-saturation
(the exhaustion of nucleation in the previous era results from only a small
decrease in super-saturation). This allows the critical size to catch up to the
clusters, and the traditional ""coarsening"" begins: Subcritical clusters
dissolve and fuel the growth of the remaining super-critical clusters. Our
analysis tracks the evolution of cluster sizes during growth and coarsening by
complimentary use of asymptotic and numerical methods. We establish
characteristic times and cluster sizes associated with growth and coarsening
from physical parameters and the initial super-saturation. The emerging
distribution is discontinuous at the largest cluster size, and our model
selects the discontinuous LS similarity solution as the long time limit. There
are strong indications that the smooth similarity solution proposed in the
original LS paper emerges on a, yet longer, late-coarsening time-scale.

frontier for the next decade. All of the solar system giant planets and the
Earth produce radio emissions as a result of interactions between their
magnetic fields and the solar wind. In the case of the Earth, its magnetic
field may contribute to its habitability by protecting its atmosphere from
solar wind erosion and by preventing energetic particles from reaching its
surface. Indirect evidence for at least some extrasolar giant planets also
having magnetic fields includes the modulation of emission lines of their host
stars phased with the planetary orbits, likely due to interactions between the
stellar and planetary magnetic fields. If magnetic fields are a generic
property of giant planets, then extrasolar giant planets should emit at radio
wavelengths allowing for their direct detection. Existing observations place
limits comparable to the flux densities expected from the strongest emissions.
Additional sensitivity at low radio frequencies coupled with algorithmic

problem scale exponentially with N, making the solution of this problem very

approach for a fully-interacting wave function with a general two-body

is order-by-order invariant under a point group isomorphic with S_N . Group
theory and graphical techniques are then used to solve for the wave function

to obtain the first-order, fully-interacting wave function for a system of
harmonically-confined bosons interacting harmonically. In this paper, we report
the first application of this N-body wave function to a system of N
fully-interacting bosons in three dimensions. We determine the density profile
for a confined system of harmonically-interacting bosons. Choosing this simple
interaction is not necessary or even advantageous for our method, however this
choice allows a direct comparison of our exact results through first order with
exact results obtained in an independent solution. Our density profile through
first-order in three dimensions is indistinguishable from the first-order exact
result obtained independently and shows strong convergence to the exact result

theory of interacting fundamental constituents valid at much finer resolution
or higher energies, usually assumed to be above the Planck energy. In this view
general relativity is an effective theory valid only at long wavelengths and
low energies. For any presumed known theory for the microscopic structure of
spacetime, we describe common tasks of emergent gravity (`top-down'), namely,
identifying the conditions and processes or mechanisms whereby the familiar
macroscopic spacetime emerges with high probability and reasonable robustness.
Going in the opposite direction (`bottom-up') is the task of quantum gravity,
i.e., finding a theory for the microscopic structure of spacetime, which, in
this new view, cannot come from quantizing the metric or connection forms
because they are the collective variables which are meaningful only for the
macroscopic theory, i.e., general relativity. We suggest pathways to move `up'
(in energy) from the given macroscopic conditions of classical gravity and
quantum field theory to the domain closer to the micro-macro interface where
spacetime emerged and places to look for clues or tell-tale signs at low energy
where one could infer indirectly some salient features of the micro-structure
of spacetime.

snow line in the protoplanetary disk plays a crucial role. Determining the
demographics of planets beyond the snow line of stars of various masses is thus
essential for testing this model. Microlensing is sensitive to planets that are
generally inaccessible to other methods, and in particular is most sensitive to
cool planets at or beyond the snow line, including very low-mass (i.e.
terrestrial) planets. Hence, microlensing is uniquely suited and so essential
for a comprehensive study of this region. Microlensing is also sensitive to
planets orbiting low-mass stars, free-floating planets, planets in the Galactic
bulge and disk, and even planets in external galaxies. These planets can also
provide critical constraints on models of planet formation. Although
microlensing searches have so far detected only a handful of planets, these
have already changed our understanding of planet formation beyond the snow
line. Next generation microlensing surveys, which would be sensitive to tens of

theory formulation of general relativity and involves replacing the Lorentz
gauge group by a larger group. This results in additional field degrees of
freedom which either must be constrained to vanish in a nontrivial way, or
require physical interpretation. With the latter in mind, we examine the
coupling of the additional fields to point particles. Nonstandard particle
degrees of freedom should be introduced in order to write down the most general
coupling. The example we study is the $GL(2,C)$ central extension of gravity
given by Chamseddine, which contains two U(1) gauge fields, and a complex
vierbein matrix, along with the usual spin connections. For the general
coupling one should then attach two U(1) charges and a complex momentum vector
to the particle, along with the spin. The momenta span orbits in a
four-dimensional complex vector space, and are classified by $GL(2,C)$
invariants and by their little groups. In addition to orbits associated with
standard massive and massless particles, a number of novel orbits can be
identified. We write down a general action principle for particles associated
with any nontrivial orbit and show that it leads to corrections to geodesic
motion. We also examine the classical and quantum theory of the particle in

are weaker towards the northern part. Assuming that the clumps are as close to
the Galactic center as their projected distances, they are still dense enough
to be gravitationally stable against the tidal shear produced by the

of the AGB star IRC+10216. The model includes shells of matter with densities
that are enhanced relative to the surrounding circumstellar medium. The
chemical model uses an updated reaction network including reactions from the
RATE06 database and a more detailed anion chemistry. In particular, new
mechanisms are considered for the formation of CN-, C3N- and C2H-, and for the
reactions of hydrocarbon anions with atomic nitrogen and with the most abundant
cations in the circumstellar envelope. New reactions involving H- are included
which result in the production of significant amounts of C2H- and CN- in the
inner envelope. The calculated radial molecular abundance profiles for the
hydrocarbons C2H, C4H and C6H and the cyanopolyynes HC3N and HC5N show narrow
peaks which are in better agreement with observations than previous models.
Thus, the narrow rings observed in molecular microwave emission surrounding
IRC+10216 are interpreted as arising in regions of the envelope where the gas
and dust densities are greater than the surrounding circumstellar medium. Our
models show that CN- and C2H- may be detectable in IRC+10216 despite the very
low theorised radiative electron attachment rates of their parent neutral
species. We also show that magnesium isocyanide (MgNC) can be formed in the
outer envelope through radiative association involving Mg+ and the cyanopolyyne
species.

the layer structure. For positive lattice mismatches, the film favors
pseudomorphic growth, whereas for negative mismatches, a sharp transition
happens within the first few monolayers of adatoms and the film layers are
transformed into the close-packed (111) structure. We propose a way to quantify
the compositional percentage of different planar structures in an epilayer, and
demonstrate the strong asymmetric effect between the tensile and compressive
cases of deposition. How temperature affects the asymmetry is also discussed.

temperature anisotropies induced by the second-order fluctuations in the
Boltzmann equation. In this paper, which is one of a series of papers on the
numerical calculation of the bispectrum from the second-order fluctuations, we
consider the terms that are products of the first-order perturbations, and
leave intrinsically second-order terms and perturbations in the recombination
history to the subsequent papers. We show that the bispectrum has the maximum
signal in the squeezed triangles, similar to the local-type primordial
bispectrum, as both types generate non-linearities via products of the
first-order terms in position space. However, detailed calculations show that
their shapes are sufficiently different: the cross-correlation coefficient
reaches 0.5 at the maximum multipole of l_{max}~ 200, and then weakens to 0.3
at l_{max}~ 2000. The differences in shape arise from (i) the way the acoustic
oscillations affect the bispectrum, and (ii) the second-order effects not being
scale-invariant. This implies that the contamination of the primordial
bispectrum due to the second-order effects (from the products of the
first-order terms) is small. The expected signal-to-noise ratio of the products
of the first-order terms is ~ 0.4 at l_{max}~ 2000 for a full-sky, cosmic
variance limited experiment. We therefore conclude that the products of the
first-order terms may be safely ignored in the analysis of the future CMB
experiments. The expected contamination of the local-form f_{NL} is
f^{local}_{NL}~ 0.9 at l_{max}~ 200, and f^{local}_{NL}~ 0.5 at l_{max}~ 2000.

stars models of low metallicity, evolved along the thermal pulse phase.
  Aims: The target of this work is to extend to low metallicities, Z=1,2 and 6
x 10^{-4}, the models previously computed for chemistries typical of Globular
Clusters of an intermediate metallicity (Z=0.001), and for the most metal-rich
clusters found in our Galaxy (Z=0.004); the main goal is to test the
self-enrichment scenario also for metal poor Globular Clusters
  Methods: We calculated three grids of intermediate-mass models with
metallicities Z=10^{-4}, 2x10^{-4}, and 6x10^{-4}; the evolutionary sequences
are followed from the pre-main sequence throughout the AGB phase, almost until
the ejection of the whole envelope. We discuss the chemistry of the ejecta, and
in particular the mass fractions of those elements that have been investigated
during the many, deep, spectrocopic surveys of Globular Clusters
  Results: Although the data for oxygen and sodium are scarce for low
metallicity Globular Clusters, the few data for the unevolved stars in NGC6397
are compatible with the models. Further, we find good agreement with the C--N
anticorrelation of unevolved stars in the cluster M15. In this cluster,
however, no stars having low oxygen ([O/Fe] = -1) have been detected. The most
massive, very metal poor clusters, should contain such stars, according to the
present models. At the lowest metallicity Z=10^{-4}, the ejecta of the most
massive AGBs have C/O>1, due to the dramatic decrease of the oxygen abundance.
We discuss the possible implications of this prediction.

introduced the notion of a ""generalized permutation pattern"" (GP) which
generalizes the concept of ""classical"" permutation pattern introduced by Knuth
in 1969. The invention of GPs led to a large number of publications related to
properties of these patterns in permutations and words. Since the work of
Babson and Steingrimsson, several further generalizations of permutation
patterns have appeared in the literature, each bringing a new set of
permutation or word pattern problems and often new connections with other
combinatorial objects and disciplines. For example, Bousquet-Melou et al.
introduced a new type of permutation pattern that allowed them to relate
permutation patterns theory to the theory of partially ordered sets.
  In this paper we introduce yet another, more general definition of a pattern,
called place-difference-value patterns (PDVP) that covers all of the most
common definitions of permutation and/or word patterns that have occurred in
the literature. PDVPs provide many new ways to develop the theory of patterns
in permutations and words. We shall give several examples of PDVPs in both
permutations and words that cannot be described in terms of any other pattern
conditions that have been introduced previously. Finally, we raise several
bijective questions linking our patterns to other combinatorial objects.

deterministically modeled population processes near the facets (codimension-one
faces) of their invariant manifolds and proves that the facets of such systems
are ""repelling."" It has been conjectured that any population process whose
network graph is weakly reversible (has strongly connected components) is
persistent. We prove this conjecture to be true for the subclass of weakly
reversible systems for which only facets of the invariant manifold are
associated with semilocking sets, or siphons. An important application of this
work pertains to chemical reaction systems that are complex-balancing. For
these systems it is known that within the interior of each invariant manifold
there is a unique equilibrium. The Global Attractor Conjecture states that each
of these equilibria is globally asymptotically stable relative to the interior
of the invariant manifold in which it lies. Our results pertaining to weakly
reversible systems imply that this conjecture holds for all complex-balancing
systems whose boundary equilibria lie in the relative interior of the boundary
facets. As a corollary, we show that the Global Attractor Conjecture holds for
those systems for which the associated invariant manifolds are two-dimensional.

structure in response to changes in their surrounding environment. Critical
mission systems increasingly incorporate adaptation and response to the
environment; examples include disaster relief and space exploration systems.
These systems can be decomposed in two parts: the adaptation policy that
specifies how the system must react according to the environmental changes and
the set of possible variants to reconfigure the system. A major challenge for
testing these systems is the combinatorial explosions of variants and
envi-ronment conditions to which the system must react. In this paper we focus
on testing the adaption policy and propose a strategy for the selection of
envi-ronmental variations that can reveal faults in the policy. Artificial
Shaking Table Testing (ASTT) is a strategy inspired by shaking table testing
(STT), a technique widely used in civil engineering to evaluate building's
structural re-sistance to seismic events. ASTT makes use of artificial

surface, leaving a non-gapped segment known as Fermi arc around the diagonal of

based on a stepwise elimination of high-energy transitions using unitary

in good agreement with experiment: We find well-defined excitation peaks around
$\omega=0$ near the nodal direction, which become strongly suppressed around
the antinodal point. The origin of the pseudogap can be traced back to a
suppression of spectral weight from incoherent excitations in a small
$\omega$-range around the Fermi energy. In a subsequent paper, also the
supercunducting phase at moderate hole doping will be discussed within the PRM
approach.

HDs in the inner and outer parts of the disk that is consistent with the
observed distributions and with the dynamical evolution scenario known as the
`Nice model'. This leads us to predict that the HD of hot population should
have the same slope of the HD of the cold population for 6.5 < H < 9, both as
steep as the slope of the Trojans' HD. Current data partially support this
prediction, but future observations are needed to clarify this issue. Because
the HD of the Trojans rolls over at H~9 to a collisional equilibrium slope that
should have been acquired when the Trojans were still embedded in the
primordial trans-Neptunian disk, our model implies that the same roll-over
should characterize the HDs of the Kuiper belt populations, in agreement with
the results of Bernstein et al. (2004) and Fuentes and Holman (2008). Finally,

HII region Gum 48d, located in the Centaurus Arm at a distance of 3.5 kpc, is
an old, well evolved HII region whose ionizing stars have moved off the main
sequence. As such, it represents a phase in the evolution of HII regions that
is less well studied than the earlier, more energetic, main sequence phase. In
this paper we use multi-wavelength archive data from a variety of sources to
perform a detailed study of this interesting region. Morphologically, Gum 48d
displays a ring-like faint HII region associated with diffuse emission from the
associated PDR, and is formed from part of a large, massive molecular cloud
complex. There is extensive ongoing star formation in the region, at scales
ranging from low to high mass, which is consistent with triggered star
formation scenarios. We investigate the dynamical history and evolution of this
region, and conclude that the original HII region was once larger and more
energetic than the faint region currently seen. The proposed history of this
molecular cloud complex is one of multiple, linked generations of star
formation, over a period of 10 Myr. Gum 48d differs significantly in morphology
and star formation that the other HII regions in the molecular cloud; these
differences are likely the result of the advanced age of the region, and its
different evolutionary status.

multi-electron wave functions are expressed as correlation functions in certain
rational CFTs. While this approach has led to a well-understood description of
the fractionally charged quasihole excitations, the quasielectrons have turned
out to be much harder to handle. In particular, forming quasielectron states
requires non-local operators, in sharp contrast to quasiholes that can be
created by local chiral vertex operators. In both cases, the operators are
strongly constrained by general requirements of symmetry, braiding and fusion.
Here we construct a quasielectron operator satisfying these demands and show
that it reproduces known good quasiparticle wave functions, as well as predicts
new ones. In particular we propose explicit wave functions for quasielectron
excitations of the Moore-Read Pfaffian state. Further, this operator allows us
to explicitly express the composite fermion wave functions in the positive Jain
series in hierarchical form, thus settling a longtime controversy. We also
critically discuss the status of the fractional statistics of quasiparticles in
the Abelian hierarchical quantum Hall states, and argue that our construction
of localized quasielectron states sheds new light on their statistics. At the
technical level we introduce a generalized normal ordering, that allows us to
""fuse"" an electron operator with the inverse of an hole operator, and also an
alternative approach to the background charge needed to neutralize CFT
correlators. As a result we get a fully holomorphic CFT representation of a
large set of quantum Hall wave functions.

formation is the presence of anti-correlations in the matter distribution at
large enough scales (r>r_c). Simple arguments show that the location of the
length-scale r_c, marking the transition from positive to negative
correlations, is the same for any class of objects as for the full matter
distribution, i.e. it is invariant under biasing. This scale is predicted by
models to be at about the same distance of the scale signaling the baryonic
acoustic oscillation scale r_{bao}. We test these predictions in the newest
SDSS galaxy samples.We find that, in several MG samples, the correlation
function remains positive at scales >250 Mpc/h, while in the concordance LCDM
it should be negative beyond r_c\approx 120 Mpc/h. In other samples the
correlation function becomes negative at scales <50 Mpc/h. To investigate the
origin of these differences we consider in detail the propagation of errors on
the sample density into the estimation of the correlation function. We conclude
that these are important at large enough separations, and that they are
responsible for the observed differences between different estimators and for
the measured sample to sample variations of the correlation function. We
conclude that, in the newest SDSS samples, the large scale behavior of the
galaxy correlation function is affected by intrinsic errors andv
olume-dependent systematic effects which make the detection of correlations to
be only an estimate of a lower limit of their amplitude, spatial extension and
statistical errors. We point out that these results represent an important
challenge to LCDM models as they largely differ from its predictions.(Abridged

limiting scaling functions that are obtained in the large-scale and small-scale

proton-proton and nucleus-nucleus collisions is presented. The basic
ingredients of the model are valence string formation based on standard PDFs
with QCD evolution and string fragmentation via the Schwinger mechanism. The
results of the model are presented and compared with data at different
centre-of-mass energies and centralities, as well as with existing models.
These results show that a good description of the main features of net-baryon
data is possible in the framework of a simplistic model, with the advantage of
making the fundamental production mechanisms manifest.

Altair and analyzed X-ray light curves, spectra, and emission lines,
investigated the temporal behavior and properties of the X-ray emitting plasma
and studied the global coronal structure. We find that Altair's corona with an
X-ray luminosity of L_X =1.4 x 10^27 erg/s and a very low activity level of log
L_X/L_bol = -7.4, is located predominantly at low latitude regions. The X-ray
emission is dominated by cool plasma (1-4 MK) at low density, and elemental
abundances exhibit a solar-like FIP effect and Ne/O ratio. The X-ray brightness
varies by 30 % over the observation, most likely due to rotational modulation
and minor activity; in contrast, no strong flares or significant amounts of hot
plasma were detected. The X-ray activity level of Altair is apparently close to
the saturation level, which is reduced by roughly four orders of magnitude when
compared to late-type stars. With its fast rotation, Altair provides an
inefficient, but very stable dynamo that mainly operates in convective layers
below its 'cooler' surface areas around the equator. This dynamo mechanism
results in magnetic activity and leads to X-ray properties that are overall
very similar to those of the quiescent Sun, despite very different underlying
stars.

compression, e.g. in sedimentation, even though they consolidate irreversibly
because of the stickiness of the particles. Particulate gels are usually
adhesive as well as cohesive and so wall effects are to be expected in general
[Michaels & Bolger (1962)]. These are rarely manifest on process engineering
scales, although they can be important in the laboratory and with formulated
products in small containers. When the assumption of non-linear poroelasticity
is combined with the idea that adhesive failure (yield) is brittle, relatively
speaking, a prescription emerges for the ratio of shear to compressive strength
S and how this varies with density. S is predicted to be of order unity at the
gel-point and then to increase rapidly thereafter. The predictions are
consistent with the experimental data available for both dilute and
concentrated gels, although more data would be welcome. A critique of a recent
paper by Condre et al. (2007) on wall effects in very dilute gels is given in

cosine power expansion on a spherical harmonics basis for the bending degree of

sparse and vibrational levels and eigenfunctions can be obtained by efficient
diagonalization techniques. We apply this method to carbonyl sulfide OCS,
hydrogen cyanide HCN, water H$_2$O, and nitrogen dioxide NO$_2$. When we base

edges in the spectra suffer severe energy shifts and smearing, and the degree
of distortion depends on the system parameters, in particular, the inner radius
of the accretion disk and the disk viewing inclination angles. The effects are
significant. Fluorescent X-ray emission lines from the inner accretion disk
could be powerful diagnostic of space-time distortion and dynamical
relativistic effects near the event horizons of accreting black holes. However,
improper treatment of the reflection component in fitting the X-ray continuum
could give rise to spurious line-like features. These features mimic the true
fluorescent emission lines and may mask their relativistic signatures. Fully
relativistic models for reflection continua together with the emission lines

defective behavior etc. While an extension to spatial interactions has been
considered early on such as in the ""game of life"", recent studies have focussed
on effects of the structure of social interaction networks.

that these two phase transitions can both be present in the core of neutron

and destination using a chain of intermediate nodes; chains are a fundamental
communication structure in MHWNs whose behavior must be understood to enable
building effective protocols. The behavior of chains is determined by a number
of complex and interdependent processes that arise as the sources of different
chain hops compete to transmit their packets on the shared medium. In this
paper, we show that MAC level interactions play the primary role in determining
the behavior of chains. We evaluate the types of chains that occur based on the
MAC interactions between different links using realistic propagation and packet
forwarding models. We discover that the presence of destructive interactions,
due to different forms of hidden terminals, does not impact the throughput of
an isolated chain significantly. However, due to the increased number of
retransmissions required, the amount of bandwidth consumed is significantly
higher in chains exhibiting destructive interactions, substantially influencing
the overall network performance. These results are validated by testbed
experiments. We finally study how different types of chains interfere with each
other and discover that well behaved chains in terms of self-interference are
more resilient to interference from other chains.

for dwarf novae, based on 46 stars with good distance estimates. This improves
upon Warner's previous relation, building upon today's improved estimates of
distance and binary inclination, and greater wavelength coverage. Together with
other distance and dynamical constraints, this calibration is then applied to a
set of ~300 known or likely dwarf novae of short orbital period, to study the
dependence of quiescent M_v, time-averaged M_v, mass ratio q, and white-dwarf
temperature T_WD, on P_orb. These distributions show that stars become much
fainter as they approach minimum P_orb, and appear to show /evolutionary
tracks/ as the secondary is whittled down by mass loss. Stars on the lower
branch have the expected properties of ""period bouncers"" -- with a feeble
secondary, faint accretion light, cool white dwarf, and long recurrence time
between eruptions. Period bounce seems to occur at a mass of 0.058+-0.008
M_sol. Stars on the lower branch may also have higher velocities and heights
above the Galactic plane, consistent with a greater age. Some are very nearby,
despite strong selection effects discriminating against the discovery of these
faint binaries accreting at very low rates. Period bouncers appear to be very
common, and probably would dominate a complete census of cataclysmic variables.

inherent non-linear problem and the corresponding regularized optimization is,
like many non-linear problems, potentially prone to local minima. We show how
this problem will be exacerbated by using an inadequate forward model. To
facilitate a more consistent full radiative transfer driven approach to ZDI we
describe a two-stage strategy that consist of a principal component analysis
(PCA) based line profile reconstruction and a fast approximate polarized
radiative transfer method to synthesize local Stokes profiles. Moreover, we
introduce a novel statistical inversion method based on artificial neural

also works for anti-commutation relations and it can be generalised to
vector-valued fields. To indicate the strengths and limitations of our

users communicate simultaneously to a single receiver over m degrees of
freedom. Each user transmits with probability lambda, where typically lambda n
< m << n, and the receiver must detect which users transmitted. We show that
when the codebook has i.i.d. Gaussian entries, detecting which users
transmitted is mathematically equivalent to a certain sparsity detection
problem considered in compressed sensing. Using recent sparsity results, we
derive upper and lower bounds on the capacities of these channels. We show that
common sparsity detection algorithms, such as lasso and orthogonal matching
pursuit (OMP), can be used as tractable multiuser detection schemes and have
significantly better performance than single-user detection. These methods do
achieve some near-far resistance but--at high signal-to-noise ratios
(SNRs)--may achieve capacities far below optimal maximum likelihood detection.
We then present a new algorithm, called sequential OMP, that illustrates that
iterative detection combined with power ordering or power shaping can
significantly improve the high SNR performance. Sequential OMP is analogous to
successive interference cancellation in the classic multiple access channel.
Our results thereby provide insight into the roles of power control and
multiuser detection on random-access signalling.
