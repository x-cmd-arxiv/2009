  We show that the strong security leak appeared in the simulations is only an
artifact and not caused by ""multiple reflections"". Since no wave modes exist at
cable length of 5% of the shortest wavelength of the signal, no wave is present
to reflect it.
  In the high wave impedance limit, the conditions used in the simulations are
heavily unphysical (requiring cable diameters up to 28000 times greater than
the measured size of the known universe) and the results are modeling artifacts
due to the unphysical values.
  At the low cable impedance limit, the observed artifacts are due to violating
the recommended (and tested) conditions by neglecting the cable capacitance
restrictions and using about 100 times longer cable than recommended without
cable capacitance compensation arrangement.
  We implement and analyze the general circuitry of Liu's circulator and
confirm that they are conceptually secure against passive attacks. We introduce
an asymmetric, more robust version without feedback loop. Then we crack all
these systems by an active attack: a circulator-based man-in-the middle attack.
  Finally, we analyze the proposed method to increase security by dropping only
high-risk bits. We point out the differences between different types of
high-risk bits and show the shortage of this strategy for some simple key
exchange protocols.

twistor space support of scattering amplitudes by examining the amplitudes in
momentum space. In this paper, we construct the actual twistor scattering
amplitudes themselves. We show that the recursion relations of Britto, Cachazo,
Feng and Witten have a natural twistor formulation that, together with the
three-point seed amplitudes, allows us to recursively construct general tree
amplitudes in twistor space. We obtain explicit formulae for $n$-particle MHV

distinct in our chiral framework), and the eight particle N^2MHV
super-amplitude. We also give simple closed form formulae for the N=8
supergravity recursion and the MHV and conjugate MHV amplitudes. This gives a
formulation of scattering amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric theories in
which superconformal symmetry and its breaking is manifest. For N^kMHV, the
amplitudes are given by 2n-4 integrals in the form of Hilbert transforms of a
product of $n-k-2$ purely geometric, superconformally invariant twistor delta
functions, dressed by certain sign operators. These sign operators subtly
violate conformal invariance, even for tree-level amplitudes in N=4 super
Yang-Mills, and we trace their origin to a topological property of split
signature space-time. We develop the twistor transform to relate our work to
the ambidextrous twistor diagram approach of Hodges and of Arkani-Hamed,
Cachazo, Cheung and Kaplan.

naturally formulated in twistor space. We recast the BCFW recursion relations
in an on-shell form that begs to be transformed into twistor space. Our twistor
transformation is inspired by Witten's, but differs in treating twistor and
dual twistor variables more equally. In these variables the three and
four-point amplitudes are amazingly simple; the BCFW relations are represented
by diagrammatic rules that precisely define the ""twistor diagrams"" of Andrew
Hodges. The ""Hodges diagrams"" for Yang-Mills theory are disks and not trees;
they reveal striking connections between amplitudes and suggest a new form for
them in momentum space. We also obtain a twistorial formulation of gravity. All
tree amplitudes can be combined into an ""S-Matrix"" functional which is the
natural holographic observable in asymptotically flat space; the BCFW formula
turns into a quadratic equation for this ""S-Matrix"", providing a holographic
description of N=4 SYM and N=8 Supergravity at tree level. We explore loop
amplitudes in (2,2) signature and twistor space, beginning with a discussion of
IR behavior. We find that the natural pole prescription renders the amplitudes
well-defined and free of IR divergences. Loop amplitudes vanish for generic
momenta, and in twistor space are even simpler than their tree-level
counterparts! This further supports the idea that there exists a sharply
defined object corresponding to the S-Matrix in (2,2) signature, computed by a
dual theory naturally living in twistor space.

tiled-image compression method that currently supports 4 compression
algorithms: Rice, Hcompress, PLIO, and GZIP. Overall, the Rice compression
algorithm strikes the best balance of compression and computational efficiency;
it is 2--3 times faster and produces about 1.4 times greater compression than
GZIP. The Rice algorithm produces 75%--90% (depending on the amount of noise in

gravity in four dimensions, where the Gauss-Bonnet term is topological. This
means that the central charge of Kerr-CFT computed in the

the entropy computed using the entropy function gives a universal correction
proportional to the Gauss-Bonnet coupling. We argue that at least in this

to this discrepancy might lie in a better understanding of boundary terms.

function is determined by minimizing the difference of the thermal conjugates

difference between the value from the dynamically updated derivatives of the

Brownian motion in the $\lambda$ space. The method is much less sensitive to
the system size, and the size of $\lambda$ window than other methods. On the

converges the partition function, and the error of the logarithm of the

long-held puzzle. In this work, we employ a phenomenological entropy form of
ideal gas, first proposed by White & Narayan, to revisit this issue. By
calculating the first-order variation of the entropy, subject to the mass- and
energy-conservation constraints, we obtain an entropy stationary equation.
Incorporated with the Jeans equation, and by specifying some functional form
for the anisotropy parameter beta, we numerically solve the two equations, and
demonstrate that the velocity anisotropy parameter plays an important role to
attain a density profile that is finite in mass, energy, and spatial extent. If
incorporated again with some empirical density profile from simulations, our
theoretical predictions of the anisotropy parameter, and the radial
pseudo-phase-space density in the outer non-gravitationally degenerate region
of the dark matter halo, agree rather well with the simulation data, and the
predictions are also acceptable in the middle weak-degenerate region of the
dark halo. The second-order variational calculus reveals the seemingly
paradoxical but actually complementary consequence that the equilibrium state
of self-gravitating systems is the global minimum entropy state for the whole
system under long-range violent relaxation, but simultaneously the local
maximum entropy state for every and any small part of the system under
short-range two-body relaxation and Landau damping. This minimum-maximum
entropy duality means that the standard second law of thermodynamics needs to
be re-expressed or generalized for self-gravitating systems. We believe that
our findings, especially the complementary second law of thermodynamics, may
provide crucial clues to the development of the statistical physics of
self-gravitating systems as well as other long-range interaction systems.

series exhibit sufficient functional connectivity, typically defined as a
measure of coupling exceeding a pre-determined threshold. However, when
uncertainty exists in the original network measurements, uncertainty in the

quantification of uncertainty of the most fundamental interest: uncertainty in
the number of edges. To illustrate this approach, we apply our procedure to

observations. For planets that can not be spatially separated from their host
stars, i.e. the vast majority of planets, the transiting planets are the only
ones allowing to probe their atmospheres. This is possible from transmission
spectroscopy or from measurements taken during secondary eclipse. An
alternative is the measurement of the Rossiter-McLaughlin-effect, which is
sensitive to the size of the planetary radius. Since the radius is
wavelength-dependent due to contributions of strong planetary absorption lines,
this opens a path to probe planetary atmospheres also with ground-based
high-resolution spectroscopy. The major goal of our numerical simulations is to
provide a reliable estimate of the amplitude of the wavelength-dependent
RM-effect. Our numerical simulations provide phase resolved synthetic spectra
modeling the partly eclipsed stellar surface during the transit in detail.
Using these spectra we can obtain RM-curves for different wavelength regions
and for a wavelength-dependent planetary radius. Curves from regions with high
and low contributions of absorption lines within the planetary atmosphere can
be compared. From these differential effects observable quantities are derived.
We applied our simulations to HD209458. Our numerical simulations show that a
detailed treatment of the limb darkening for the synthetic spectra is important
for a precise analysis. Compared to a parameterized limb darkening law,
systematic errors of 6 m/sec occur. The wavelength dependency of the planetary
atmospheres over the NaD-doublet produce a differential effect in the RM-curve
of 1.5 m/sec for a star with a rotation velocity of 4.5 km/sec which increases
to 4 m/sec for twice the rotation velocity.

in the $c$ direction, a state with $\pm\pi$ kinks in the superconductivity
phase difference piled up alternatively along the c axis is stabilized. The
$\pm\pi$ phase kinks provide inter-lock between superconductivity phases in
adjacent junctions, taking the advantage of huge inductive couplings inherent
in the cuprate superconductors, which establishes the coherence across the
whole system of more than $\sim 600$ junctions. They also permit a strong
coupling between the lateral cavity mode and the transverse Josephson plasma,
enhance the plasma oscillation significantly at the cavity modes which radiates

laboratory for investigating massive star formation under extreme conditions.
But it comes at a high price: the cluster is hidden behind several tens of
magnitudes of visual extinction. Severe crowding requires space or AO-assisted
instruments to resolve the stellar populations, and even with the best
instruments interpreting the data is far from direct. Several investigations
using NICMOS and the most advanced AO imagers on the ground revealed an overall
top-heavy IMF for the cluster, with a very flat IMF near the center. There are
several effects, however, that could potentially bias these results, in
particular the strong differential extinction and the problem of transforming
the observations into a standard photometric system in the presence of strong
reddening. We present new observations obtained with the NAOS-Conica (NACO)
AO-imager on the VLT. The problem of photometric transformation is avoided by
working in the natural photometric system of NACO, and we use a Bayesian
approach to determine masses and reddenings from the broad-band IR colors. A

center is confirmed, but is less severe than previously thought. We find
$\Gamma=-0.88\pm0.20$, which is incompatible with previous determinations.
Within 0.4 pc we derive a total mass of $\sim2.0(\pm0.6)\times10^{4}M_{\sun}$
for the cluster and a central mass density $\rho = 2(\pm0.4)\times10^{5}
M_{\sun}pc^{-3}$ that confirms Arches as the densest known young massive
cluster in the Milky Way.

characterized by trapping or eddying of particle trajectories produced by the

test particles and on test modes. It determines non-standard statistics of

trajectories form quasi-coherent structure. Trajectory trapping has strong
nonlinear effects on the test modes on turbulent plasmas. We determine the

high-rate regime. In particular, we derive the high-rate scaling law for MP
decoding of LDPC codes on the binary erasure channel (BEC) and the $q$-ary
symmetric channel ($q$-SC). For the BEC, the density evolution (DE) threshold
of iterative decoding scales like $\Theta(k^{-1})$ and the critical stopping
ratio scales like $\Theta(k^{-j/(j-2)})$. For the $q$-SC, the DE threshold of
verification decoding depends on the details of the decoder and scales like
$\Theta(k^{-1})$ for one decoder.
  Using the fact that coding over large finite alphabets is very similar to
coding over the real numbers, the analysis of verification decoding is also
extended to the the compressed sensing (CS) of strictly-sparse signals. A DE
based approach is used to analyze the CS systems with randomized-reconstruction
guarantees. This leads to the result that strictly-sparse signals can be
reconstructed efficiently with high-probability using a constant oversampling
ratio (i.e., when the number of measurements scales linearly with the sparsity
of the signal). A stopping-set based approach is also used to get stronger
(e.g., uniform-in-probability) reconstruction guarantees.

also important in the outer Galactic disk, where the star formation rates are
lower, we study the spatial distribution of molecular cloud (MC) inclinations
with respect to the Galactic plane. The latter contains important information
on the nature of the mechanism of energy injection into the ISM. We analyze the
spatial correlations between the position angles (PAs) of a selected sample of
MCs (the largest clouds in the catalogue of the outer Galaxy published by Heyer
et al. 2001). Our results show that when the PAs of the clouds are all mapped
to values into the [0,90]degrees interval, there is a significant degree of
spatial correlation between the $PA$s on spatial scales in the range of 100-800
pc. These scales are of the order of the sizes of individual SN shells in low
density environments such as those prevailing in the outer Galaxy and where the
metallicity of the ambient gas is of the order of the solar value or smaller.
These findings suggest that individual SN explosions, occurring in the outer
regions of the Galaxy and in likewise spiral galaxies, albeit at lower rates,
continue to play an important role in shaping the structure and dynamics of the
ISM in those regions. The SN explosions we postulate here are likely associated
with the existence of young stellar clusters in the far outer regions of the

defined in Weinberger (2002) as ""the amount of information actually used in
making a decision"". Because a study of information rates led to the Noiseless
and Noisy Coding Theorems, two of the most important results of Shannon's
theory, we begin the paper by defining a pragmatic information rate, showing
that all of the relevant limits make sense, and interpreting them as the
improvement in compression obtained from using the correct distribution of
transmitted symbols.
  The first of two applications of the theory extends the information theoretic
analysis of the Kelly Criterion, and its generalization, the horse race, to a
series of races where the stochastic process of winning horses, payoffs, and
strategies depend on some stationary process, including, but not limited to the
history of previous races. If the bettor is receiving messages (side
information) about the probability distribution of winners, the doubling rate
of the bettor's winnings is bounded by the pragmatic information of the
messages.
  A second application is to the question of market efficiency. An efficient
market is, by definition, a market in which the pragmatic information of the
""tradable past"" with respect to current prices is zero. Under this definition,
markets whose returns are characterized by a GARCH(1,1) process cannot be
efficient.
  Finally, a pragmatic informational analogue to Shannon's Noisy Coding Theorem
suggests that a cause of market inefficiency is that the underlying
fundamentals are changing so fast that the price discovery mechanism simply
cannot keep up. This may happen most readily in the run-up to a financial
bubble, where investors' willful ignorance degrade the information processing
capabilities of the market.

mathematical theory associated with the thermohaline circulations (THC). This
article provides a general transition and stability theory for the Boussinesq

First, it is shown that the first transition is either to multiple steady
states or to oscillations (periodic solutions), determined by the sign of a
nondimensional parameter $K$, depending on the geometry of the physical domain
and the thermal and saline Rayleigh numbers. Second, for both the multiple
equilibria and periodic solutions transitions, both Type-I (continuous) and
Type-II (jump) transitions can occur, and precise criteria are derived in terms
of two computable nondimensional parameters $b_1$ and $b_2$. Associated with
Type-II transitions are the hysteresis phenomena, and the physical reality is
represented by either metastable states or by a local attractor away from the
basic solution, showing more complex dynamical behavior. Third, a convection
scale law is introduced, leading to an introduction of proper friction terms in
the model in order to derive the correct circulation length scale. In
particular, the dynamic transitions of the model with the derived friction
terms suggest that the THC favors the continuous transitions to stable multiple
equilibria. Applications of the theoretical analysis and results to different
flow regimes will be explored in the accompanying articles.

given sufficient pump intensity, and hence spontaneously break a discrete

self-organization brings the additional feature of continuous translational

way for realizations of compliant lattices and associated phenomena, e.g.,
quantum melting, topological defects, frustration, glassiness, and even
supersolidity; such phenomena are absent in ultracold atomic systems when the
optical lattices are externally imposed. We apply a functional integral

calculate transition thresholds, explore fluctuations near this transition, and
determine how such fluctuations are manifest in the light emitted from the

interacting with a nuclear spin bath. Although in the limit of a very large
magnetic field the only decoherence mechanism is spectral diffusion due to
dipolar flip-flops of nuclear spins, with decreasing field the
hyperfine-mediated interactions between the nuclear spins become important. We
take advantage of their long-range nature, and resum the leading terms in an
1/N expansion of the decoherence time-evolution function (N, being the number
of nuclear spins interacting appreciably with the electron spin, is large). For
the case of the thermal uncorrelated bath we show that our theory is applicable
down to low magnetic fields (~10 mT for a large dot with N=10^6) allowing for
comparison with recent experiments in GaAs quantum dot spin qubits. Within this
approach we calculate the free induction decay and spin echo decoherence in
GaAs and InGaAs as a function of the number of the nuclei in the bath (i.e. the
quantum dot size) and the magnetic field. Our theory for free induction decay
in a narrowed nuclear bath is shown to agree with the exact solution for
decoherence due to hyperfine-mediated interaction which can be obtained when
all the nuclei-electron coupling constants are identical. For the spin echo
evolution we show that the dominant decoherence process at low fields is due to
interactions between nuclei having significantly different Zeeman energies
(i.e. nuclei of As and two isotopes of Ga in GaAs), and we compare our results
with recent measurements of spin echo signal of a single spin confined in a
GaAs quantum dot. For the same set of parameters we perform calculations of

with X-ray luminosities in the range L_0.5-2 keV = 10^41--10^43 erg s^-1,
consistent with the previously observed sample. Objects with enough counts to
extract a spectrum are well fit by an absorbed power law. We continue to find a
range of soft photon indices 1 < \Gamma_s < 2.7, where N(E) \propto
E^-\Gamma_s, consistent with previous AGN studies, but generally flatter than
other narrow-line Seyfert 1 active nuclei (NLS1s). The soft photon index
correlates strongly with X-ray luminosity and Eddington ratio, but does not
depend on BH mass. There is no justification for the inclusion of any
additional components, such as a soft excess, although this may be a function
of the relative inefficiency of detecting counts above 2 keV in these
relatively shallow observations. As a whole, the X-ray-to-optical spectral
slope \alpha_ox is flatter than in more massive systems, even other NLS1s. Only
X-ray-selected NLS1s with very high Eddington ratios share a similar \alpha_ox.
This is suggestive of a physical change in the accretion structure at low
masses and at very high accretion rates, possibly due to the onset of slim
disks. Although the detailed physical explanation for the X-ray loudness of
these intermediate-mass BHs is not certain, it is very striking that targets
selected on the basis of optical properties should be so distinctly offset in
their broader spectral energy distributions.

The absorber properties depend on rho, but the relations are not simple

moderate-resolution optical spectrophotometry of WOH G64 with the MARCS stellar
atmosphere models, determining an effective temperature of 3400 +/- 25 K. We

0.05 for WOH G64, quite similar to the luminosity reported by Ohnaka and
collaborators based on their radiative transfer modeling of the star's dust
torus. We determine a radius of R/R_sun = 1540, bringing the size of WOH G64
and its position on the H-R diagram into agreement with the largest known
Galactic RSGs, although it is still extreme for the LMC. In addition, we use
the Ca II triplet absorption feature to determine a radial velocity of 294 +/-
2 km/s for the star; this is the same radial velocity as the rotating gas in
the LMC's disk, which confirms its membership in the LMC and precludes it from
being an unusual Galactic halo giant. Finally, we describe the star's unusual

displays a radial velocity that is significantly more positive than the star
itself by 50 km/s.

correlation between black hole mass and velocity dispersion with redshift. We
track the growth and accretion history of massive black holes starting from
high redshift using two seeding models:(i) Population III remnants, and (ii)
massive seeds from direct gas collapse. Although the seeds do not initially
satisfy the $M_{\rm BH} - \sigma$ relation, the correlation is established and
maintained at all times if self-regulating accretion episodes are associated
with major mergers. The massive end of the $M_{\rm BH} - \sigma$ relation is
established early, and lower mass MBHs migrate over time. How MBHs migrate
toward the relation, the slope and the scatter of the relation all depend
critically on the seeding model as well as the adopted self-regulation
prescription. We expect flux limited AGN surveys and LISA to select accreting
and merging MBHs respectively that have already migrated onto the $\msigma$
relation. This is a consequence of major mergers being more common at high
redshift for the most massive, biased, galaxies that anchor the $\msigma$
relation early. We also predict the existence of a large population of low mass

of massive, M>10^{14.5}M_sun, galaxy clusters (GCs) may be approximately
described by simple analytic expressions, which depend on the GC thermal X-ray
properties and on two model parameter, beta_{core} and eta_e. beta_{core} is
the ratio of CR energy density (within a logarithmic CR energy interval) and
the thermal energy density at the GC core, and eta_{e(p)} is the fraction of
the thermal energy generated in strong collisionless shocks, which is deposited
in CR electrons (protons). Using a simple analytic model for the evolution of
ICM CRs, which are produced by accretion shocks (primary CRs), we find that
beta_{core} ~ eta_{p}/200, nearly independent of GC mass and with a scatter
Delta ln(beta_{core}) ~ 1 between GCs of given mass. We show that the HXR and
gamma-ray luminosities produced by IC scattering of CMB photons by primary
electrons exceed the luminosities produced by secondary particles (generated in
hadronic interactions within the GC) by factors ~500(eta_e/eta_p)(T/10
keV)^{-1/2} and ~150(eta_e/eta_p)(T/10 keV)^{-1/2} respectively, where T is the
GC temperature. Secondary particle emission may dominate at the radio and VHE
(> 1 TeV) gamma-ray bands. Our model predicts, in contrast with some earlier
work, that the HXR and gamma-ray emission from GCs are extended, since the
emission is dominated at these energies by primary electrons. Our predictions

eta_peta_e ~ 0.1. The implications of our predictions to future HXR

  Filter Arrays",,,,,"cs.MM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a new approach for image compression in digital cameras, where the
goal is to achieve better quality at a given rate by using the characteristics
of a Bayer color filter array. Most digital cameras produce color images by
using a single CCD plate, so that each pixel in an image has only one color
component and therefore an interpolation method is needed to produce a full
color image. After the image processing stage, in order to reduce the memory
requirements of the camera, a lossless or lossy compression stage often
follows. But in this scheme, before decreasing redundancy through compression,
redundancy is increased in an interpolation stage. In order to avoid increasing
the redundancy before compression, we propose algorithms for image compression
in which the order of the compression and interpolation stages is reversed. We
introduce image transform algorithms, since non interpolated images cannot be
directly compressed with general image coders. The simulation results show that
our algorithm outperforms conventional methods with various color interpolation
methods in a wide range of compression ratios. Our proposed algorithm provides
not only better quality but also lower encoding complexity because the amount
of luminance data used is only half of that in conventional methods.

stringent constraints on cluster magnetic fields and cosmic rays (CRs): Within
the cores of clusters, the ratio beta_{core} between the CR energy (per
logarithmic particle energy interval) and the thermal energy is beta_{core}\sim
2*10^{-4}; The source of these CRs is most likely the cluster accretion shock,
which is inferred to deposit in CRs ~ 0.1 of the thermal energy it generates;
The diffusion time of 100 GeV CRs over scales \gtrsim100 kpc is not short

\gtrsim 1 % of equipartition, and decay (to <1 muG) on 1 Gyr time scales. The

secondaries at cluster cores will be difficult to detect with existing and

be chosen to provide service, which generally makes it harder for agents
without sybils to earn money and decreases social welfare. Surprisingly, in

While collusion is generally bad, in the context of scrip systems it actually

of a narrow, central Gaussian with an underlying broad component. The broad HI
Balmer component splits into two separate broad components inside a 1"".5 radius
from the nucleus; these are attributed to a two-armed mini-spiral. The rotation
curve of Mrk 996 derived from the H\alpha narrow component yields a total mass
of 5x10^8 Msol within a radius of 3 kpc.
  The high excitation energy, high critical density [O III] 4363 and [N II]
5755 lines are only detected from the inner region and exist purely in broad
component form, implying unusual excitation conditions. Surface brightness,
radial velocity, and FWHM maps for several emission components are presented. A
separate physical analysis of the broad and narrow emission line regions is
undertaken. We derive an upper limit of 10,000 K for the electron temperature
of the narrow line gas, together with an electron density of 170 cm^-3, typical
of normal H II regions. For the broad line component, we estimate a temperature
of 11,000 K and an electron density of 10^7 cm^-3. The broad line emission
regions show a N/H enrichment factor of ~20 relative to the narrow line
regions, but no He/H, O/H, S/H, or Ar/H enrichment is inferred. The dominant
line excitation mechanism is photoionisation by the ~3000 WR stars and ~150,000

BCD, with extremely dense zones of gas in the core, through which stellar
outflows and possible shock fronts permeate contributing to the excitation of

properties in the context of other metal-poor galaxies, the SMC, IC 10 and NGC
1569. Methods: Very Large Telescope/FORS2 imaging and spectroscopy plus
archival Hubble Space Telescope/ACS imaging datasets permit us to spatially
identify the location, number and probable subtypes of Wolf-Rayet stars within
this galaxy. We also investigate suggestions that a significant fraction of the
ionizing photons of the two giant HII regions A1 and A2 lie deeply embedded
within these regions. Results: Wolf-Rayet stars are associated with a number of
sources within IC 4662-A1 and A2, plus a third compact HII region to the north
west of A1 (A1-NW).Several sources appear to be isolated, single (or binary)
luminous nitrogen sequence WR stars, while extended sources are clusters whose
masses exceed the Orion Nebula Cluster by, at most, a factor of two. IC 4662
lacks optically visible young massive, compact clusters that are common in
other nearby dwarf irregular galaxies. A comparison between radio and
Halpha-derived ionizing fluxes of A1 and A2 suggests that 30-50% of their total
Lyman continuum fluxes lie deeply embedded within these regions. Conclusions:
The star formation surface density of IC 4662 is insufficient for this galaxy
to qualify as a starburst galaxy, based upon its photometric radius, R_25. If
instead, we were to adopt the V-band scale length R_D from Hunter & Elmegreen,
IC 4662 would comfortably qualify as a starburst galaxy, since its star
formation intensity would exceed 0.1 M_sun/yr/kpc^2.

circular polarization in OMC1. We assume that the grains are composed of
silicates and ellipsoidal (oblate, prolate, or tri-axial ellipsoid) in shape
with a typical axial ratio of 2:1. The angular dependence of circular
polarization p_c on directions of incident and scattered light is investigated
with spherical harmonics and associated Legendre polynomials. The degree of
circular polarization p_c also depends on the Rayleigh reduction factor R which
is a measure of imperfect alignment. We find that p_c is approximately
proportional to R for grains with |m|x_{eq} < 3 - 5, where x_{eq} is the
dimensionless size parameter and m is the refractive index of the grain. Models
that include those grains can explain the observed large circular polarization

OMC1, if the directions of incidence and scattering of light is optimal, and if
grain alignment is strong, i.e. R > 0.5. Such a strong alignment cannot be
explained by the Davis-Greenstein mechanism; we prefer instead an alternative
mechanism driven by radiative torques. If the grains are mixed with silicates

entanglement have been discovered, namely, the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger
(GHZ) class and the W class. To date, much research effort has been
concentrated on the polarization entangled three-photon GHZ and W states. Most
studies of continuous variable multiparticle entanglement have been focused on
Gaussian states. In this Brief Report, we examine two classes of three-photon
entangled states in space and time. One class is a three-mode three-photon
entangled state and the other is a two-mode triphoton state. These states show
behavior similar to the GHZ and W states when one of the photons is not
detected. The three-mode entangled state resembles a W state, while a two-mode
three-photon state resembles a GHZ state when one of the photons is traced
away. We characterize the distinction between these two states by comparing the
second-order correlation functions $G^{(2)}$ with the third-order correlation
function $G^{(3)}$.

(2004)] have been the subject of many theoretical studies, but their driving
mechanisms have yet to be described in a unified manner. The former effect
arises from the adiabatic topological curvature of momentum space, from which
holes acquire a spin-dependent anomalous velocity. The SHE in the Rashba
system, on the other hand, results from the momentum-dependent spin dynamics in
the presence of an external electric field. The two effects clearly appear to
originate from distinct mechanisms. Our motivation for this article is to
address this apparent disparity and, in particular, to seek a unifying
description of the effects. In this endeavor, we consider the explicit
time-dependence of SHE systems starting with a general spin-orbit model. We
find that by performing a gauge transformation of the general model with
respect to time, a well-defined gauge field appears in time space which has the
physical significance of an effective magnetic field. This magnetic field is
shown to precisely account for the SHE in the Rashba system in the adiabatic
limit. Remarkably, by carefully analyzing the equation of motion of the general
model, this field component is also found to be the origin of the anomalous
velocity due to the momentum space curvature. Our study therefore unifies the
two seemingly disparate intrinsic SHEs under a common adiabatic framework.

metallicities Z = 10-4 and Z = 10-8 . We determine which stars undergo an
episode of flash-driven mixing, where protons are ingested into the intershell
convection zone, as they enter the thermally pulsing AGB phase and which
undergo third dredge-up. We find that flash-driven mixing does not occur above
a metallicity of Z = 10-5 for any mass of star and that stars above 2 M do not
experience this phenomenon at any metallicity. We find carbon ingestion (CI),
the mixing of carbon into the tail of hydrogen burning region, occurs in the
mass range 2 M to around 4 M . We suggest that CI may be a weak version of the
flash-driven mechanism. We also investigate the effects of convective
overshooting on the behaviour of these objects. Our models struggle to explain
the frequency of CEMP stars that have both significant carbon and nitrogen
enhancement. Carbon can be enhanced through flash-driven mixing, CI or just
third dredge up. Nitrogen can be enhanced through hot bottom burning and the
occurrence of hot dredge-up also converts carbon into nitrogen. The C/N ratio
may be a good indicator of the mass of the primary AGB stars.

the disk is comparable to the stellar mass in the galaxy. This suggests slow
accretion of the HI material at a relatively recent time. There is also a hint
of a warp in the outer parts of the HI disk. The central, stellar disk appears
relatively blue, with faint near UV emission, and is oriented (roughly)
parallel to the surrounding wall, implying gas accretion from out of the voids.
The considerable gas mass and apparent lack of stars in the polar disk, coupled

cold flow accretion as an alternate formation mechanism for polar disk

direct correlation with the local tunneling conductance. These results are
attributed to a strain-induced frequency increase in the out-of-plane phonon

strong magnetic fields, and yet their surface temperatures are so low that the
coupling is expected to be small between the matter and the magnetic field in
the atmosphere. In the deeper layers, however, the coupling is expected to be
much stronger. Aims: This raises the question of whether the magnetic field
still leads to the formation of structures in the photosphere. Methods: We
carried out a spectroscopic monitoring campaign of two ultracool dwarfs that
have strong magnetic fields: the BD LP944-20 and 2MASSW J0036159+182110.
LP944-20 was observed simultaneously in the optical and in the near infrared
regime, 2MASSW J0036159+182110 only in the infrared. Results: Both dwarfs
turned out to be remarkably constant. In the case of LP944-20, the
Teff-variations are <50K, and the rms-variations in the equivalent widths of
Halpha small. We also find that the equivalent widths of photospheric lines are
remarkably constant. We did not find any significant variations in the case of
2MASSW J0036159+182110 either. Thus the most important result is that no
significant variability was found at the time of our observations. When
comparing our spectra with spectra taken over the past 11 years, we recognize
significant changes during this time. Conclusions: We interpret these results
as evidence that the photosphere of these objects are remarkably homogeneous,
with only little structure in them, and despite the strong magnetic fields.
Thus, unlike active stars, there are no prominent spots on these objects.

of the emission region of the TeV flare is three times larger than that of the
optical/X-ray outburst, and the strength of the magnetic field for the TeV
flare is $\sim 14$ times smaller than that of the X-ray/optical outburst,
likely indicating that the region of the TeV flare is more distant from the
core than that of the X-ray/optical outburst. The IC component of the TeV flare
peaks at around 1.3 GeV, but it is around 20 MeV for the X-ray/optical
outburst, lower than that for the TeV flare with 2 orders of magnitude. The
model predicts that the optical/X-ray outburst might be accompanied by a strong
MeV/GeV emission, but the TeV flare may be not associated with the
X-ray/optical outburst. The GeV emission is critical to characterize the SEDs
of the optical/X-ray outburst and the TeV flare. The predicted GeV flux is
above the sensitivity of \emph{Fermi}/LAT, and it could be verified with the
observations by \emph{Fermi}/LAT in near future.

important phenomenon whereby long periods of genetic stasis alternate with
short periods of rapid evolutionary change. This paper provides a mathematical
interpretation of punctualism as a sequence of change of basin of attraction
for a diffusion model of the theory of adaptive dynamics. Such results rely on
large deviation estimates for the diffusion process. The main difficulty lies
in the fact that this diffusion process has degenerate and non-Lipschitz
diffusion part at isolated points of the space and non-continuous drift part at
the same points. Nevertheless, we are able to prove strong existence and the
strong Markov property for these diffusions, and to give conditions under which
pathwise uniqueness holds. Next, we prove a large deviation principle involving
a rate function which has not the standard form of diffusions with small noise,
due to the specific singularities of the model. Finally, this result is used to
obtain asymptotic estimates for the time needed to exit an attracting domain,
and to identify the points where this exit is more likely to occur.

posseses d-wave superconducting states and orbital current states depending on

this effect is assessed using a renormalization group analysis. At high doping,
disorder causes intraband instabilities and at low doping it promotes interband
instabilities. In the former case, we extend the boundary conformal field
theory method, developed in the context of single chains, to handle the ladder
problem, and we find exact closed-form analytical expressions for the

local quantities such as the nuclear magnetic resonance line broadenings and
scanning tunnelling microscope profiles. We also discuss the low doping regime
where Kondo physics is at play, making qualitative predictions about its

generally nontrivial. Using ab initio density functional theory we find that
the straight ferromagnetic (FM) state typical of bulk Fe as well as of isolated
Fe chains and double chains is disfavored after deposition on Ir(100) for all
the experimentally relevant double chain structures considered. So long as
spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is neglected, the double chain lowest energy state is
generally antiferromagnetic (AFM), a state which appears to prevail over the FM
state due to Fe-Ir hybridization. Successive inclusion of SOC adds two further
elements, namely a magnetocrystalline anisotropy, and a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
(DM) spin-spin interaction, the former stabilizing the collinear AFM state, the
second favoring a long-period spin modulation. We find that anisotropy is most
important when the double chain is adsorbed on the partially deconstructed
Ir(100) -- a state which we find to be substantially lower in energy than any
reconstructed structure -- so that in this case the Fe double chain should
remain collinear AFM. Alternatively, when the same Fe double chain is adsorbed
in a metastable state onto the (5x1) fully reconstructed Ir(100) surface, the
FM-AFM energy difference is very much reduced and the DM interaction is
expected to prevail, probably yielding a helical spin structure.

planet formation from Leinhardt and Richardson (2005) to include dynamical
friction from the unresolved debris component. In the previous work we
implemented a rubble pile planetesimal collision model into direct N-body
simulations of terrestrial planet formation. The new collision model treated
both accretion and erosion of planetesimals but did not include dynamical
friction from debris particles smaller than the resolution limit for the
simulation. By extending our numerical model to include dynamical friction from
the unresolved debris, we can simulate the dynamical effect of debris produced
during collisions and can also investigate the effect of initial debris mass on
terrestrial planet formation. We find that significant initial debris mass, 10%
or more of the total disk mass, changes the mode of planetesimal growth.
Specifically, planetesimals in this situation do not go through a runaway
growth phase. Instead they grow concurrently, similar to oligarchic growth. In
addition to including the dynamical friction from the unresolved debris, we
have implemented particle tracking as a proxy for monitoring compositional
mixing. Although there is much less mixing due to collisions and gravitational
scattering when dynamical friction of the background debris is included, there
is significant inward migration of the largest protoplanets in the most extreme
initial conditions.

of these BCMs to be early-type galaxies, and 48% of cD type. We confirm
previous findings based on much smaller samples, namely that a large fraction
of BCMs have significant peculiar velocities. For a subsample of 452 clusters
with at least 10 measured radial velocities, we find a median BCM peculiar
velocity of 32% of their host clusters' radial velocity dispersion. This
suggests that most BCMs are not at rest in the potential well of their
clusters, and that the phenomenon is thus not a special trait of clusters
hosting cD galaxies. We show that the peculiar velocity of the BCM is
independent of cluster richness and only slightly dependent on the Bautz-Morgan
type. We also find a weak trend for the peculiar velocity to rise with the
cluster velocity dispersion. The strongest dependence is with the morphological
type of the BCM: cD galaxies tend to have lower relative peculiar velocities
than elliptical galaxies. This result points to a connection between the
formation of the BCMs and that of their clusters. Our data are qualitatively
consistent with the merging-groups scenario, where BCMs in clusters formed
first in smaller subsystems comparable to compact groups of galaxies. In this
scenario, clusters would have formed recently from the mergers of many such
groups and would still be in a dynamically unrelaxed state.

induced in the dot consists of two terms, the pumping current and a
rectification-like term. The last contribution arises from the time-derivative
of the tunneling phase and can have even or odd parity with respect to the
pumping phase \varphi. The rectification-like term is also discussed in
relation to some recent experiments in quantum-dots.

cues. For such spontaneous movements, a variety of different modes have been
observed, including the amoeboid-like locomotion with protrusion of multiple
pseudopods, the keratocyte-like locomotion with a widely spread lamellipodium,
cell division with two daughter cells crawling in opposite directions, and
fragmentations of a cell to multiple pieces. Mutagenesis studies have revealed
that cells exhibit these modes depending on which genes are deficient,
suggesting that seemingly different modes are the manifestation of a common
mechanism to regulate cell motion. In this paper, we propose a hypothesis that
the positive feedback mechanism working through the inhomogeneous distribution
of regulatory proteins underlies this variety of cell locomotion and
cytofission. In this hypothesis, a set of regulatory proteins, which we call
cortical factors, suppress actin polymerization. These suppressing factors are
diluted at the extending front and accumulated at the retracting rear of cell,
which establishes a cellular polarity and enhances the cell motility, leading
to the further accumulation of cortical factors at the rear. Stochastic
simulation of cell movement shows that the positive feedback mechanism of
cortical factors stabilizes or destabilizes modes of movement and determines
the cell migration pattern. The model predicts that the pattern is selected by
changing the rate of formation of the actin-filament network or the threshold
to initiate the network formation.

homogeneous shear flow of an incompressible fluid. The analytical solutions for
all magnetohydrodynamic variables are presented by confluent Heun functions.
The problem is reduced to finding a solution of an effective Schroedinger
equation. The amplification of slow magnetosonic waves is analyzed in great
details. A simple formula for the amplification coefficient is derived. The
velocity shear primarily affects the incompressible limit of slow magnetosonic
waves. The amplification is very strong for slow magnetosonic waves in the
long-wavelength limit. It is demonstrated that the amplification of those waves
leads to amplification of turbulence. The phenomenology of Shakura-Sunyaev for
the friction in accretion disks is derived in the framework of the Kolmogorov
turbulence. The presented findings may be the key to explaining the anomalous
plasma heating responsible for the luminosity of quasars. It is suggested that
wave amplification is the keystone of the self-sustained turbulence in

evolution, we take into account an effect pointed out in the past few years by
a number of studies mostly based on intensive N-body simulations, namely that
typical halo growth occurs in two phases: an early, fast collapse phase
featuring several major merger events, followed by a late, quiescent accretion
onto the halo outskirts. We propose that the two modes of halo growth drive two
distinct modes for the evolution of baryonic matter, favoring the development
of the spheroidal and disc components of galaxies, respectively. We test this
idea using the semianalytic technique. Our galaxy formation model envisages an
early coevolution of spheroids and the central supermassive black holes,
already tested in our previous works, followed by a relatively quiescent growth
of discs around the preformed spheroids. In this exploratory study, we couple
our model to the spectrophotometric code GRASIL, and compare our results on

the star formation rate (SFR) dependent integrated galactic initial mass
function (IGIMF). We study how the global chemical evolution of a galaxy and in
particular how [alpha/Fe] abundance ratios are affected by the predicted
steepening of the IGIMF with decreasing SFR. We use analytical and
semi-analytical calculations to evaluate the mass-weighted and
luminosity-weighted [alpha/Fe] ratios in early-type galaxies of different
masses. The models with the variable IGIMF produce a [alpha/Fe] vs. velocity
dispersion relation which has the same slope as the observations of massive
galaxies, irrespective of the model parameters, provided that the star
formation duration inversely correlates with the mass of the galaxy
(downsizing). These models also produce steeper [alpha/Fe] vs. sigma relations
in low-mass early-type galaxies and this trend is consistent with the
observations. Constant IMF models are able to reproduce the [alpha/Fe] ratios
in large elliptical galaxies as well, but they do not predict this change of
slope for small galaxies. In order to obtain the best fit between our results
and the observations, the downsizing effect (i.e. the shorter duration of the
star formation in larger galaxies) must be milder than previously thought.

complexity classes like the class FPTIME of polynomial time computable
functions. This analysis comes from the works of Bellantoni and Cook, and
Leivant by data tiering. Here, we refine predicative analysis by using a
ramified Ackermann's construction of a non-primitive recursive function. We
obtain a hierarchy of functions which characterizes exactly functions, which
are computed in O(n^k) time over register machine model of computation. For
this, we introduce a strict ramification principle. Then, we show how to
diagonalize in order to obtain an exponential function and to jump outside
deterministic polynomial time. Lastly, we suggest a dependent typed
lambda-calculus to represent this construction.

interactions. The long range interactions enhance the $4k_{F}$ scattering and
renormalize the wire to a strongly interacting limit. For large screening
lengths, the renormalized charge stiffness Luttinger parameter $K_{eff.}$
decreases to $K_{eff.}< {1/2}$, giving rise to a Wigner crystal at T=0 with an
anomalous conductance at finite temperatures.
  For short screening lengths, the renormalized Luttinger parameter $K_{eff.}$
is restricted to ${1/2}\leq K_{eff.}\leq 1$. As a result, at temperatures
larger than the magnetic exchange energy we find an interacting metal which for
$K_{eff.}\approx {1/2}$ is equivalent to the Hubbard $U\to\infty$ model, with
the anomalous conductance $G\approx\frac{e^2}{h}$ .

a manifold $X$ as an exact elliptic equation of Einstein type on a manifold $M$
of which $X$ is one of the (K\""ahler) symplectic reductions via a (non-trivial)
torus action. There are plenty of such manifolds (e.g. any line bundle on $X$
will do). Such an equation is called $V$-soliton equation, which can be
regarded as a generalization of K\""ahler-Einstein equations or K\""ahler-Ricci
solitons. As in the case of K\""ahler-Einstein metrics, we can also reduce the
$V$-soliton equation to a scalar equation on K\""ahler potentials, which is of
Monge-Ampere type. We then prove some preliminary results towards establishing
existence of solutions for such a scalar equation on a compact K\""ahler
manifold $M$. One of our motivations is to apply the interpretation to studying
finite time singularities of the K\""ahler-Ricci flow.

large fraction of the total particle number density thus one needs to consider
neutrino self-refraction. Coherent neutrino-neutrino scattering has been found
to play a role in the flavour evolution of the system. Traditionally this
problem has been analysed by assuming that the wavefunction of the system can
be factorised into one-body states. However in 1992 Pantaleone showed that a
neutrino ensemble is in general a many-body problem due to the off-diagonal
contribution to the neutrino refractive index. This topic was unexamined until
recently. It has been suggested by Bell, Rawlinson and Sawyer that quantum
entanglement could play an essential role in the flavour evolution of the dense
neutrino system.
  In this thesis we examine the validity of the one-body approximation by
constructing a many-body neutrino model. The neutrino system is modelled by a
system of interacting spins following earlier work of Friedland and Lunardini.
We extend this work by generalising the model to initial states with asymmetric
flavour composition. We find an exact analytical solution to the system. The
investigation has revealed an array of interesting physics including
semi-classical behaviour, quantum equilibration and a transition from
semi-classical to purely quantum regimes. Further, this study has found no
evidence for the violation of the one-body description of a dense neutrino
ensemble. We also note that our analysis is valid for any two state system with
equal strength interactions.
