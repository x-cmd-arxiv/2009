GeV scale -- can be spectacularly probed in low-energy e+e- collisions. A
low-mass dark sector can explain the annual modulation signal reported by
DAMA/LIBRA and the PAMELA, ATIC, and INTEGRAL observations by generating small
mass splittings and new interactions for weak-scale dark matter. Some of these
observations may be the first signs of a low-mass dark sector that collider
searches can definitively confirm. Production and decay of O(GeV)-mass dark
states is mediated by a Higgsed Abelian gauge boson that mixes kinetically with
hypercharge. Existing data from BaBar, BELLE, CLEO-c, and KLOE may contain
thousands of striking dark-sector events with a high multiplicity of leptons
that reconstruct mass resonances and possibly displaced vertices. We discuss
the production and decay phenomenology of Higgsed and confined dark sectors and
propose e+e- collider search strategies. We also use the DAMA/LIBRA signal to
estimate the production cross-sections and decay lifetimes for dark-sector
states.

that DAMA is observing hyperfine transitions of a composite dark matter

reality, however, social cooperation can also arise spontaneously, based on
local interactions rather than centralized control. The self-organization of
cooperative behavior is particularly puzzling for social dilemmas related to
sharing natural resources or creating common goods. Such situations are often
described by the prisoner's dilemma. Here, we report the sudden outbreak of
predominant cooperation in a noisy world dominated by selfishness and
defection, when individuals imitate superior strategies and show success-driven
migration. In our model, individuals are unrelated, and do not inherit
behavioral traits. They defect or cooperate selfishly when the opportunity
arises, and they do not know how often they will interact or have interacted
with someone else. Moreover, our individuals have no reputation mechanism to
form friendship networks, nor do they have the option of voluntary interaction
or costly punishment. Therefore, the outbreak of prevailing cooperation, when
directed motion is integrated in a game-theoretical model, is remarkable,
particularly when random strategy mutations and random relocations challenge
the formation and survival of cooperative clusters. Our results suggest that
mobility is significant for the evolution of social order, and essential for
its stabilization and maintenance.

when the ion temperature is finite. It is argued that turbulence in the
dissipation range of the solar wind must be one, or a mixture, of three
electromagnetic wave modes: the parallel whistler, oblique whistler, or kinetic
Alfven waves. These modes are generally well described by Hall MHD. Determining
the applicability of linear kinetic damping rates in turbulent plasmas requires
a suite of fluid and kinetic nonlinear numerical simulations. Contrasting fluid
and kinetic simulations will also shed light on whether the presence of
spurious wave modes alters the nonlinear couplings inherent in turbulence and
will illuminate the turbulent dynamics and energy transfer in the regime of the

In particular, suppose $\sL$ is a sufficiently ample line bundle on $X$ (for
example, if $\sL$ induces a projectively normal embedding) with $n = \dim
H^0(X, \sL)$. We show that the number of $d$-dimensional irreducible

  Compatibly split subvarieties are closely related to log canonical centers.
Our methods apply in any characteristic, and so we are also able to bound the

then investigate properties of the open-string disk amplitude integrated over

we find that the QCD scattering amplitude is a convolution of the standard
Koba-Nielsen integrand and a kernel. As usual poles originate from the first
factor, whereas no (momentum dependent) poles can arise from the kernel. We
show that the kernel becomes a constant when the number of external particles
becomes large. The usual Veneziano amplitude then emerges in the kinematical
regime where the Wilson loop can be reliably approximated by the area behavior.

exact solution of the SO(5) Richardson-Gaudin model for isovector pairing in a
system of non-degenerate single particle orbits. Two isovector PBCS wave
functions are considered. One is constructed as a single proton-neutron pair
condensate, while the other corresponds to a product of a neutron pair
condensate and a proton pair condensate. The PBCS equations are solved using a
recurrence method and the analysis is performed for systems with an equal
number of neutrons and protons distributed in a sequence of equally spaced
4-fold (spin-isospin) degenerate levels. The results show that although PBCS
improves significantly over BCS, the agreement of PBCS with the exact solution
is less satisfactory than in the case of the SU(2) Richardson model for pairing
between like particles.

information on the inner bulk flow structure, to provide a direct investigation
of the magnetic field configuration, in particular the presence and the
strength of a poloidal component, and to understand the origin of some emitting
features, such as the knot, whose origins are still uncertain. The inverse
Compton radiation is examined to disentangle the different contributions to
radiation from the magnetic field and the particle energy distribution
function, and to search for a possible hadronic component in the emitting PWN,
and thus for the presence of ions in the wind. If hadronic radiation was found
in a PWN, young supernova remnants would provide a natural birth-place of the

particles' substances. Our approach is based upon the notion of macroscopic
compact groups of particles and the procedure of averaging of the fields over
volumes much greater than the typical scales of these groups. It enables us to
effectively sum up the contributions from multiple interparticle reemission and
short-range correlation effects, represented by all terms in the infinite
iterative series for the electric field strength and induction. The expression
for the effective permittivity can be given the form of the Lorentz-Lorenz
type, which allows us to determine the effective polarizabilities of the
particles in the mixture. These polarizabilities are found as integrals over
the regions occupied by the particles and taken of explicit functions of the
principal components of the permittivity tensors of the particles' substances
and the permittivity of the host medium. The case of a mixture of particles of
the ellipsoidal shape is considered in detail to exemplify the use of general

amount of data transmitted without error, over a continuous Markov flat-fading
wireless channel. In particular, we consider schemes in which transmitter
channel state is inferred from degraded causal error-rate feedback, such as
packet-level ACK/NAKs in an automatic repeat request (ARQ) system. In such
schemes, the choice of transmission rate affects not only the subsequent
goodput but also the subsequent feedback, implying that the optimal rate
schedule is given by a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP).
Because solution of the POMDP is computationally impractical, we consider
simple suboptimal greedy rate assignment and show that the optimal scheme would
itself be greedy if the error-rate feedback was non-degraded. Furthermore, we
show that greedy rate assignment using non-degraded feedback yields a total
goodput that upper bounds that of optimal rate assignment using degraded
feedback. We then detail the implementation of the greedy scheme and propose a
reduced-complexity greedy scheme that adapts the transmission rate only once
per block of packets. We also investigate the performance of the schemes
numerically, and show that the proposed greedy scheme achieves steady-state
goodputs that are reasonably close to the upper bound on goodput calculated
using non-degraded feedback. A similar improvement is obtained in steady-state
goodput, drop rate, and average buffer occupancy in the presence of data
buffers. We also investigate an upper bound on the performance of optimal rate
assignment for a discrete approximation of the channel and show that such
quantization leads to a significant loss in achievable goodput.

concepts or meanings, as opposed to life specific experiences. The organization
of concepts within semantic memory can be understood as a semantic network,
where the concepts (nodes) are associated (linked) to others depending on
perceptions, similarities, etc. Lexical access is the complementary part of
this system and allows the retrieval of such organized knowledge. While
conceptual information is stored under certain underlying organization (and
thus gives rise to a specific topology), it is crucial to have an accurate
access to any of the information units, e.g. the concepts, for efficiently
retrieving semantic information for real-time needings. An example of an
information retrieval process occurs in verbal fluency tasks, and it is known
to involve two different mechanisms: -clustering-, or generating words within a
subcategory, and, when a subcategory is exhausted, -switching- to a new
subcategory. We extended this approach to random-walking on a network
(clustering) in combination to jumping (switching) to any node with certain
probability and derived its analytical expression based on Markov chains.
Results show that this dual mechanism contributes to optimize the exploration
of different network models in terms of the mean first passage time.
Additionally, this cognitive inspired dual mechanism opens a new framework to
better understand and evaluate exploration, propagation and transport phenomena

distribution within the disc galaxies in the last ~8 Gyr. We use as a proxy for
the SF radial profile the Near-UV surface brightness distributions, allowing
suitably for extinction. We compare the effective radii (R_eff) and
concentration of the flux distribution in the rest-frame Near-UV for a sample
of 270 galaxies in the range 0<z<1. This radial distribution is compared to
that measured in the rest-frame B-band, which traces older stellar populations.
The analysis is performed using deep, high resolution, multi-band images from
GALEX, SDSS, and HST/ACS - GOODS-South. The relation R_eff(NUV)- M* suffers a
moderate change between z~1 and z~0: at a fixed stellar mass of 1E10 M_sun,
galaxies increase their effective radii by a factor 1.18+/-0.06. Median
profiles in NUV show signs of truncation at R~R_eff, and median colour profiles
(NUV-B) show a minimum (a ""bluest"" point) also around R~1-1.5 R_eff. The
distributions of NUV flux are more compact at z~1 than nowadays, in terms of
the fraction of flux enclosed in a specific radius (in kpc). Our results
indicate that the SF surface density has decreased dramatically in discs since
z~1, and this decline has been more intense in the central parts (<~R_eff) of
the galaxies. In addition, our data suggest that the bulges/pseudo-bulges have
grown in surface brightness with regard to the discs since z~1.

the electric field induced by the solar wind magnetic field accelerates them
very efficiently. Since the voltage produced by dust impacts increases very
fast with speed, such nanoparticles produce signals as high as do much larger
grains of smaller speeds. The flux of 10-nm radius grains inferred in this way
is compatible with the interplanetary dust flux model. The present results may
represent the first detection of fast nanoparticles in interplanetary space

Friedrichs Hamiltonian model makes it possible to provide a qualitatively
correct phenomenological model of kaons physics. In this previous paper, we
derived a violation parameter that is 14 times larger than the measured
quantity. In the present paper we improve our estimation of the violation and
obtain the right order of magnitude. The improvement results from a
renormalized superposition of the probability amplitudes describing short and
long exponential decays. The renormalization occurs because the amplitudes that
we are dealing with are associated to the decay rate, and not to the integrated
decay rate or survival probability as is usually the case in standard
approaches to CP-violation. We also compare with recent experimental data for
the mesons D and B and also there the agreement between our model and

Myr to 9 Gyr have been carried out as part of the ""Sun in Time"" program for
nearly 20 yrs. From these studies it is inferred that the young (ZAMS) Sun was
rotating more than 10x faster than today. As a consequence, young solar-type
stars and the early Sun have vigorous magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) dynamos and
correspondingly strong coronal X-ray and transition region / chromospheric
FUV-UV emissions. To ensure continuity and homogeneity for this program, we use
a restricted sample of G0-5 V stars with masses, radii, T(eff), and internal
structure (i.e. outer convective zones) closely matching those of the Sun. From
these analogs we have determined reliable rotation-age-activity relations and
X-ray - UV (XUV) spectral irradiances for the Sun (or any solar-type star) over
time. These XUV irradiance measures serve as input data for investigating the
photo-ionization and photo-chemical effects of the young, active Sun on the
paleo-planetary atmospheres and environments of solar system planets. These
measures are also important to study the effects of these high energy emissions
on the numerous exoplanets hosted by solar-type stars of different ages.
Recently we have extended the study to include lower mass, main-sequence
(dwarf) dK and dM stars to determine relationships among their rotation
spin-down rates and coronal and chromospheric emissions as a function of mass
and age. From rotation-age-activity relations we can determine reliable ages
for main-sequence G, K, M field stars and, subsequently, their hosted planets.
Also inferred are the present and the past XUV irradiance and plasma flux
exposures that these planets have endured and the suitability of the hosted
planets to develop and sustain life.

We obtain the envelope binding energy from detailed stellar models of the
progenitor primary, with and without the thermal and ionization energy, but we
also test a commonly used analytical scaling. We also employ the alternative
angular momentum budget approach, known as the $\gamma$-algorithm. We find that
a constant, global value of $\alpha_{\rmn{CE}} \ga 0.1$ can adequately account
for the observed population of PCEBs with late spectral-type secondaries.
However, this prescription fails to reproduce IK Pegasi, which has a secondary
with spectral type A8. We can account for IK Pegasi if we include thermal and
ionization energy of the giant's envelope, or if we use the $\gamma$-algorithm.
However, the $\gamma$-algorithm predicts local space densities that are 1 to 2
orders of magnitude greater than estimates from observations. In contrast, the
canonical energy budget prescription with an initial mass ratio distribution
that favours unequal initial mass ratios gives a local space density which is
in good agreement with observations, and best reproduces the observed
distribution of PCEBs. Finally, all models fail to reproduce the sharp decline
for orbital periods, $P_{\rmn{orb}} \ga 1$ d in the orbital period distribution
of observed PCEBs, even if we take into account selection effects against

either indirectly or directly: the Hertzprung-Russell Diagram (HRD) and the
Mass-Luminosity Relation (MLR). The extremes of both maps, while not terra
incognita, are characterized by large uncertainties. A precise HRD requires
precise distance obtained by direct measurement of parallax. A precise MLR

goal the critical test of theoretical stellar models. Such tests require mass
accuracies of ~1%. Substantial improvement in both maps requires astrometry
with microsecond of arc measurement precision. Why? First, the 'tops' of both
stellar maps contain relatively rare objects, for which large populations are
not found until the observing horizon reaches hundreds or thousands of parsecs.
Second, the 'bottoms' and 'sides' of both maps contain stars, either
intrinsically faint, or whose rarity guarantees great distance, hence apparent
faintness. With an extensive collection of high accuracy masses that can only
be provided by astrometry with microsecond of arc measurement precision,
astronomers will be able to stress test theoretical models of stars at any mass

systems, such as synthetic aperture radar and sonar, and ultrasound and laser
imaging. This type of noise is also commonly referred to as speckle.
Multiplicative noise introduces two additional layers of difficulties with
respect to the popular Gaussian additive noise model: (1) the noise is
multiplied by (rather than added to) the original image, and (2) the noise is
not Gaussian, with Rayleigh and Gamma being commonly used densities. These two
features of the multiplicative noise model preclude the direct application of
state-of-the-art restoration methods, such as those based on the combination of
total variation or wavelet-based regularization with a quadratic observation
term. In this paper, we tackle these difficulties by: (1) using the common
trick of converting the multiplicative model into an additive one by taking
logarithms, and (2) adopting the recently proposed split Bregman approach to
estimate the underlying image under total variation regularization. This
approach is based on formulating a constrained problem equivalent to the
original unconstrained one, which is then solved using Bregman iterations
(equivalently, an augmented Lagrangian method). A set of experiments show that
the proposed method yields state-of-the-art results.

double-peaked ellipsoidal modulation. This indicates that even in `quiescence'

Sodium layer in the upper atmosphere at approximately 90 km of altitude. Since
the Sodium layer is approximately 10 km thick, the artificial reference source
looks elongated, especially when observed from the edge of a large aperture.
The spot elongation strongly limits the performance of the most common

sensor, for instance, decreases proportionally to the elongation (in a photon
noise dominated regime). To compensate for this effect a straightforward
solution is to increase the laser power, i.e. to increase the number of
detected photons per subaperture. The scope of the work presented in this paper
is twofold: an analysis of the performance of the Weighted Center of Gravity

required number of photons to achieve a certain average wavefront error over

Most existing data are, however, for giant stars which may have experienced
internal mixing later. AIMS: We aim to compare the results for giants with new,
accurate abundances for all observable elements in 18 EMP turnoff stars.
METHODS:VLT/UVES spectra at R ~45,000 and S/N~ 130 per pixel (330-1000 nm) are
analysed with OSMARCS model atmospheres and the TURBOSPECTRUM code to derive
abundances for C, Mg, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, Sr, and Ba. RESULTS:
For Ca, Ni, Sr, and Ba, we find excellent consistency with our earlier sample
of EMP giants, at all metallicities. However, our abundances of C, Sc, Ti, Cr,
Mn and Co are ~0.2 dex larger than in giants of similar metallicity. Mg and Si
abundances are ~0.2 dex lower (the giant [Mg/Fe] values are slightly revised),
while Zn is again ~0.4 dex higher than in giants of similar [Fe/H] (6 stars
only). CONCLUSIONS:For C, the dwarf/giant discrepancy could possibly have an
astrophysical cause, but for the other elements it must arise from shortcomings
in the analysis. Approximate computations of granulation (3D) effects yield
smaller corrections for giants than for dwarfs, but suggest that this is an
unlikely explanation, except perhaps for C, Cr, and Mn. NLTE computations for
Na and Al provide consistent abundances between dwarfs and giants, unlike the
LTE results, and would be highly desirable for the other discrepant elements as
well. Meanwhile, we recommend using the giant abundances as reference data for
Galactic chemical evolution models.

efficiency and mass-loading of supernova heated and enriched plasma in a

constraints have medium to high thermalization efficiencies (30% <= epsilon <=

is only mildly centrally mass loaded (1.0 <= beta <= 2.8). These results imply
a temperature of the plasma within the starburst region in the range 30--80

since the time delay is known very precisely. One important systematic effect
is the mass sheet degeneracy, which arises because strong lens modeling cannot
constrain the presence or absence of a uniform mass sheet $\kappa$, which
rescales $H_0$ by the factor $(1-\kappa)$. In this paper we present new
constraints on the mass sheet derived from a weak-lensing analysis of the
Hubble Space Telescope imaging of a 6 arcmin square region surrounding the
lensed quasar. The average mass sheet within a circular aperture (the strong
lens model region) is constrained by integrating the tangential weak
gravitational shear over the surrounding area. We find the average convergence
within a $30""$ radius around the lens galaxy to be $\kappa(<30"") =
0.166\pm0.056$ ($1\sigma$ confidence level), normalized to the quasar redshift.
This includes contributions from both the lens galaxy and the surrounding
cluster. We also constrain a few other low-order terms in the lens potential by
applying a multipole aperture mass formalism to the gravitational shear in an
annulus around the strong lensing region. Implications for strong lens models

hardness ratio maps of 30 nearby rich Abell clusters (17 cool cores and 13

surface brightness profiles and single beta-models for non-cool core profiles
yield statistically significant differences in the slopes (i.e., beta values)
of the outer surface brightness profiles, but similar cluster core radii, for
the two types of clusters. Hardness ratio profiles as well as
spectroscopically-fit temperatures suggest that non-cool core clusters are
warmer than cool core clusters of comparable mass beyond the cluster cores. We
compared the properties of these clusters with the results from analogously
reduced simulations of 88 numerical clusters created by the AMR Enzo code. The
simulated surface brightness profiles have steeper beta-model fits in the outer
cluster regions for both cool cores and non-cool cores, suggesting additional
ICM heating is required compared to observed cluster ICMs. Temperature and
surface brightness profiles reveal that the simulated clusters are over-cooled
in their cores. As in the observations, however, simulated hardness ratio and
temperature profiles indicate that non-cool core clusters are warmer than cool
core clusters of comparable mass far beyond the cluster cores. The general
similarities between observations and simulations support a model described in

debris disks are found for one early-type and for three solar-type stars.
Corrections for sampling statistics yield a 24 micron excess fraction (debris
disk fraction) of 6.5 +- 4.1% for luminous and 1.9 +- 1.2% for solar-type
stars. The incidence of excesses is in agreement with the decay trend of debris
disks as a function of age observed for other cluster and field stars. The
values also agree with those for older stars, indicating that debris generation
in the zones that emit at 24 micron falls to the older 1-10 Gyr field star
sample value by roughly 750 Myr.
  We discuss our results in the context of previous observations of excess
fractions for early- and solar-type stars. We show that solar-type stars lose
their debris disk 24 micron excesses on a shorter timescale than early-type
stars. Simplistic Monte Carlo models suggest that, during the first Gyr of

in seven early-type galaxies through long-slit observations. A template spectra
was constructed from galaxies void of warm gas and subtracted from the
emission-line galaxies, allowing for a clean measurement of the nebular lines.
The ratios of the emission lines are consistent with photoionization, which
likely originates from the UV flux of post-asymototic giant branch (PAGB)
stars. We employ H II region photoionization models to determine a mean oxygen
metallicity of $1.01\pm0.50$ solar for the warm interstellar medium (ISM) in
this sample. This warm ISM 0.5 to 1.5 solar metallicity is consistent with
modern determinations of the metallicity in the hot (T$\sim 10^{6}-10^{7}K$)
ISM and the upper range of this warm ISM metallicity is consistent with stellar
population metallicity determinations. A solar metallicity of the warm ISM
favors an internal origin for the warm ISM such as AGB mass loss within the
galaxy.

positivity and monotonicity when numerically solving hyperbolic conservation
laws. Unfortunately, the original methods suffer from the truncation-error
being first-order accurate at all extrema despite the accuracy of the
higher-order method. To remedy this problem, higher-order extensions were
proposed that relied on elaborate analytic and geometric constructions. Since
extremum-preserving limiters are applied only at extrema, additional
computational cost is negligible. Therefore, extremum-preserving limiters
ensure higher-order spatial accuracy while maintaining simplicity. This report
presents higher-order limiting for (i) computing van Leer slopes and (ii)
adjusting parabolic profiles. This limiting preserves monotonicity and accuracy
at smooth extrema, maintains stability in the presence of discontinuities and
under-resolved gradients, and is based on constraining the interpolated values
at extrema (and only at extrema) by using nonlinear combinations of second
derivatives. The van Leer limiting can be done separately and implemented in
MUSCL (Monotone Upstream-centered Schemes for Conservation Laws) or done in
concert with the parabolic profile limiting and implemented in PPM (Piecewise
Parabolic Method). The extremum-preserving limiters elegantly fit into any
algorithm which uses conventional limiting techniques. Limiters are outlined
for scalar advection and nonlinear systems of conservation laws. This report
also discusses the fourth-order correction to the point-valued, cell-centered
initial conditions that is necessary for implementing higher-order limiting.

this galaxy with vertical scale height 1.44+/-0.03 kpc and radial scale length
4.8+/-0.1 kpc, only slightly longer than that of the thin disk. A stellar
spheroid with a de Vaucouleurs-like profile is detected from a radial distance
of 0.5 kpc to the edge of the survey at 25 kpc; the structure appears to become
more flattened with distance, reaching q = 0.50 in the outermost halo region

-1.1) and approximately uniform in median metallicity. Beyond that distance a
modest chemical gradient is detected, with the median reaching [Fe/H] ~ -1.3 at
20 kpc. We find evidence for subtle, but very significant, small-scale
variations in the median colour and density over the halo survey area. We argue
that the colour variations are unlikely to be due to internal extinction or
foreground extinction, and reflect instead variations in the stellar
metallicity. Their presence suggests a startling conclusion: that the halo of
this galaxy is composed of a large number of incompletely-mixed
sub-populations, testifying to its origin in a deluge of small accretions.

stars with a wide range of metallicities, from a metal-poor tail at [Fe/H] ~
-2.4 dex, up to about half-solar metallicity. The peak of the MDF of the thick
disk is at -0.9 dex. The inner parts of the thick disk, within 14 kpc along the
major axis show no vertical colour/metallicity gradient. In the outer parts, a
mild vertical gradient of Delta(V-I)/Delta|Z| = 0.1 +/- 0.05 kpc^-1 is

poor halo stars. No metallicity gradient along the major axis is present for
thick disk stars, but strong variations of about 0.35 dex around the mean of

envelope in the near infrared. We used the IAGPOL imaging polarimeter along
with the CamIV infrared camera at the LNA observatory to obtain near infrared
polarimetry measurements at the H band of a sample of optically visible YSOs,
namely, eleven T Tauri stars and eight Herbig Ae/Be stars. An independent
determination of the disk (or jet) orientation was obtained for twelve objects
from the literature. The circumstellar optical depth could be then estimated
comparing the integrated polarization position angle (PA) with the direction of
the major axis of the disk projected in the plane of the sky. In general,
optically thin disks have polarization PA perpendicular to the disk plane. In
contrast, optically thick disks produce polarization PA parallel to the disks.
Among the T Tauri stars, three are consistent with optically thin disks (AS
353A, RY Tau and UY Aur) and five with optically thick disks (V536 Aql, DG Tau,
DO Tau, HL Tau and LkHalpha 358). Among the Herbig Ae/Be stars, two stars show
evidence of optically thin disk (Hen 3-1191 and VV Ser) and two of optically
thick disks (PDS 453 and MWC 297). Our results seem consistent with the fact
that optically thick disks at near infrared bands are associated more likely
with younger YSOs. Marginal evidence of polarization reversal is found in RY
Tau, RY Ori, WW Vul, and UY Aur. On the first three cases this feature can be
associated to the UXOR phenomenon. Correlations with the IRAS colours and the
spectral index yielded evidence of an evolutionary segregation with the disks
tend to be optically thin when they are older.

fate decisions, which ultimately generate the diversity of differentiated
cells. Efforts to understand cell fate control have focused on simple gene
regulatory circuits that predict the presence of multiple stable states,
bifurcations and switch-like transitions. However, existing gene network models
do not explain more complex properties of cell fate dynamics such as the
hierarchical branching of developmental paths. Here, we construct a generic
minimal model of the genetic regulatory network controlling cell fate
determination, which exhibits five elementary characteristics of cell
differentiation: stability, directionality, branching, exclusivity, and
promiscuous expression. We argue that a modular architecture comprising
repeated network elements reproduces these features of differentiation by
sequentially repressing selected modules and hence restricting the dynamics to
lower dimensional subspaces of the high-dimensional state space. We implement
our model both with ordinary differential equations (ODEs), to explore the role
of bifurcations in producing the one-way character of differentiation, and with
stochastic differential equations (SDEs), to demonstrate the effect of noise on
the system. We further argue that binary cell fate decisions are prevalent in
cell differentiation due to general features of the underlying dynamical
system. This minimal model makes testable predictions about the structural
basis for directional, discrete and diversifying cell phenotype development and
thus can guide the evaluation of real gene regulatory networks that govern
differentiation.

natural reduction of this problem to a set of binary regression problems

  The pinned distance set $\Delta_y(E)=\{{(x_1-y_1)}^2+...+{(x_d-y_d)}^2: x\in

$\tfrac{d+1}{2}$ then the Lebesgue measure of $\Delta_y(E)$ is positive for
almost every pin $y$. In this paper we obtain the analogous result in the
finite field setting. In addition, the same result is shown to be true for the
pinned dot product set $\Pi_y(E)=\{x\cdot y: x\in E\}$. Under the additional
assumption that the set $E$ has cartesian product structure we improve the
pinned threshold for both distances and dot products to $\frac{d^2}{2d-1}$.

thousands of people. Public safety considerations greatly limit clinical
experimentation on this organism and thus development of theoretical tools to
analyze the capabilities of this pathogen is of utmost importance. Here, we
report the first genome-scale metabolic model of Yersinia pestis biovar
Mediaevalis based both on its recently annotated genome, and physiological and
biochemical data from literature. Our model demonstrates excellent agreement
with Y. pestis known metabolic needs and capabilities. Since Y. pestis is a
meiotrophic organism, we have developed CryptFind, a systematic approach to
identify all candidate cryptic genes responsible for known and theoretical
meiotrophic phenomena. In addition to uncovering every known cryptic gene for
Y. pestis, our analysis of the rhamnose fermentation pathway suggests that betB
is the responsible cryptic gene. Despite all of our medical advances, we still
do not have a vaccine for bubonic plague. Recent discoveries of antibiotic
resistant strains of Yersinia pestis coupled with the threat of plague being
used as a bioterrorism weapon compel us to develop new tools for studying the
physiology of this deadly pathogen. Using our theoretical model, we can study
the cells phenotypic behavior under different circumstances and identify
metabolic weaknesses which may be harnessed for the development of
therapeutics. Additionally, the automatic identification of cryptic genes
expands the usage of genomic data for pharmaceutical purposes.

(\pcpdt) [$2A\to 4A$, $2A\to 0$] is studied in one dimension, focused on the
crossover to other well established universality classes: the directed Ising
(DI) and the directed percolation (DP). First, we show that the \pcpdt shares
the critical behaviors with the PCPD, both with and without directional bias.
Second, the crossover from the \pcpdt to the DI is studied by including a
parity-conserving single-particle process ($A \to 3A$). We find the crossover
exponent $1/\phi_1 = 0.57(3)$, which is argued to be identical to that of the
PCPD-to-DP crossover by adding $A \to 2A$. This suggests that the PCPD
universality class has a well defined fixed point distinct from the DP. Third,
we study the crossover from a hybrid-type reaction-diffusion process belonging
to the DP [$3A\to 5A$, $2A\to 0$] to the DI by adding $A \to 3A$. We find
$1/\phi_2 = 0.73(4)$ for the DP-to-DI crossover. The inequality of $\phi_1$ and
$\phi_2$ further supports the non-DP nature of the PCPD scaling. Finally, we
introduce a symmetry-breaking field in the dual spin language to study the
crossover from the \pcpdt to the DP. We find $1/\phi_3 = 1.23(10)$, which is
associated with a new independent route from the PCPD to the DP.

relation which relates variations of mass parameter and horizon area. While it
is well known that the MFL of asymptotic flat black hole is equivalent to its
thermodynamical first law, however we do not know the detail of MFL of black
hole spacetimes with cosmological constant which possess black hole and
cosmological event horizons. Then this paper aims to formulate an MFL of the
two-horizon spacetimes. For this purpose, we try to include the effects of two
horizons in the MFL. To do so, we make use of the Iyer-Wald formalism and
extend it to regard the mass parameter and the cosmological constant as two
independent variables which make it possible to treat the two horizons on the
same footing. Our extended Iyer-Wald formalism preserves the existence of
conserved Noether current and its associated Noether charge, and gives the
abstract form of MFL of black hole spacetimes with cosmological constant. Then,
as a representative application of that formalism, we derive the MFL of
Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) spacetime. Our MFL of SdS spacetime relates the
variations of three quantities; the mass parameter, the total area of two
horizons and the volume enclosed by two horizons. If our MFL is regarded as a
thermodynamical first law of SdS spacetime, it offers a thermodynamically
consistent description of SdS black hole evaporation process: The mass
decreases while the volume and the entropy increase. In our suggestion, the
generalized second law is not needed to ensure the second law of SdS
thermodynamics for its evaporation process.

Survey (Astro2010)1 Committee on the State of the Profession to emphasize the
potential of the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) to
contribute to the training of instrumentalists and observers, and to related
technology developments. This potential goes beyond the primary mission of
SOFIA, which is to carry out unique, high priority astronomical research.
  SOFIA is a Boeing 747SP aircraft with a 2.5 meter telescope. It will enable
astronomical observations anywhere, any time, and at most wavelengths between
0.3 microns and 1.6 mm not accessible from ground-based observatories. These
attributes, accruing from the mobility and flight altitude of SOFIA, guarantee
a wealth of scientific return. Its instrument teams (nine in the first
generation) and guest investigators will do suborbital astronomy in a
shirt-sleeve environment. The project will invest $10M per year in science
instrument development over a lifetime of 20 years. This, frequent flight
opportunities, and operation that enables rapid changes of science instruments
and hands-on in-flight access to the instruments, assure a unique and extensive
potential - both for training young instrumentalists and for encouraging and
deploying nascent technologies. Novel instruments covering optical, infrared,
and submillimeter bands can be developed for and tested on SOFIA by their
developers (including apprentices) for their own observations and for those of
guest observers, to validate technologies and maximize observational
effectiveness.

protein properties are expressed (and can be utilized) in such a configuration.
While most such studies to date were conducted with one or just a few molecules
in the junction, we present the high yield, reproducible preparation of large
area monolayer junctions of proteins from three different families: Azurin
(Az), a blue-copper ET protein, Bacteriorhodopsin (bR), a membrane
protein-chromophore complex with a proton pumping function, and Bovine Serum
Albumin (BSA). Surprisingly, the current-voltage (I-V) measurements on such
junctions, which are highly reproducible, show relatively minor differences
between Az and bR, even though the latter lacks a known ET function. ETp across
both Az and bR is much more efficient than across BSA, but also for the latter
the currents are still high, and the decay coefficients too low to be
consistent with coherent tunneling. Rather, inelastic hopping is proposed to
dominate ETp in these junctions. Other features such as asymmetrical I-V curves
and distinct behavior of different proteins can be viewed as molecular
signatures in the solid-state conductance.

addition of volume metrics, computation of feature entropy, and distinct item

in realistic settings on a local cluster as well as on PlanetLab and show that
they work in near real-time for up to 140 input providers and 9 computation
nodes. Compared to implementations using existing general-purpose MPC
frameworks, our protocols are significantly faster, requiring, for example, 3
minutes for a task that takes 2 days with general-purpose frameworks. This
improvement paves the way for new applications of MPC in the area of
networking. Finally, we run SEPIA's protocols on real traffic traces of 17

order phase transition to the crystal. Yet, under certain conditions it is
possible to keep the system in its metastable phase and to avoid
crystallization. In this way the liquid enters in the supercooled phase.
Supercooled liquids have a very rich phenomenology, which is still far from
being completely understood. To begin with, there is the problem of how to
prevent crystallization and how deeply the liquid can be supercooled before a
metastability limit is hit. But by far the most interesting feature of
supercooled liquids is the dynamic glass transition: when the temperature is
decreased below a certain point, the relaxation time increases so much that a
dramatic dynamical arrest intervenes and we are unable to equilibrate the
system within reasonable experimental times. The glass transition is a
phenomenon whose physical origin has stirred an enormous interest in the last
hundred years. Why does it occur? Is it just a conventional reference point, or
does it have a more profound physical meaning? Is it a purely dynamical event,
or the manifestation of a true thermodynamic transition? What is the
correlation length associated to the sharp increase of the relaxation time? Can
we define a new kind of amorphous order? A shared theory of supercooled liquids
and the glass transition does not yet exist and these questions are still
largely open. Here, I will illustrate in the most elementary fashion the main
phenomenological traits of supercooled liquids and discuss in a very partial
way a few theoretical ideas on the subject.

  Virginia, USA, October, 2008",,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Network operators are reluctant to share traffic data due to security and
privacy concerns. Consequently, there is a lack of publicly available traces
for validating and generalizing the latest results in network and security
research. Anonymization is a possible solution in this context; however, it is
unclear how the sanitization of data preserves characteristics important for
traffic analysis. In addition, the privacy-preserving property of
state-of-the-art IP address anonymization techniques has come into question by
recent attacks that successfully identified a large number of hosts in
anonymized traces.
  In this paper, we examine the tradeoff between data utility for anomaly
detection and the risk of host identification for IP address truncation.
Specifically, we analyze three weeks of unsampled and non-anonymized network
traces from a medium-sized backbone network to assess data utility. The risk of
de-anonymizing individual IP addresses is formally evaluated, using a metric
based on conditional entropy.
  Our results indicate that truncation effectively prevents host identification
but degrades the utility of data for anomaly detection. However, the degree of
degradation depends on the metric used and whether network-internal or external
addresses are considered. Entropy metrics are more resistant to truncation than
unique counts and the detection quality of anomalies degrades much faster in
internal addresses than in external addresses. In particular, the usefulness of
internal address counts is lost even for truncation of only 4 bits whereas
utility of external address entropy is virtually unchanged even for truncation
of 20 bits.

Indeed, a criterion of Nachmias and Peres (2008) implies appropriate bounds on

volume bounds apply also to any finite number of the largest clusters. The main

EUCLID main galaxy sample, where bias evolution b(a)=b_0+(1-a)b_a is modelled
with two parameters b_0 and b_a. Using a realistic bias model introduces a
characteristic suppression of the iSW-spectrum on large angular scales, due to
the altered distance-weighting functions. The errors in estimating cosmological
parameters if the data with evolving bias is interpreted in the framework of
cosmologies with constant bias is quantified in an extended Fisher-formalism.
We find that the best-fit values of all parameters are shifted by an amount
comparable to the statistical accuracy: The estimation bias in units of the
statistical accuracy amounts to 1.19 for Omega_m, 0.27 for sigma_8, and 0.72

renormalizations and self-similarity of the Mandelbrot set. In the quadratic
case, straightening maps are always continuous, and this is one of the critical
steps to prove the Mandelbrot set has small copies in itself.
  On the other hand, for higher degree case, we do not have such a nice
self-similar property: As expected from an example of a cubic-like family with
discontinuous straightening map by Douady and Hubbard, we prove that the
straightening map is discontinuous unless it is of disjoint type.

and spectral index), and a thermal dust template with fixed spectral index, we
found that the low-$\ell$ ($\ell < 50$) CMB power spectrum is in good agreement

found to be small ($\lesssim 3 \mu$K) or negligible in the 5-yr data. We
comprehensively tested the assumptions that were made about the foregrounds
(e.g. dust spectral index, power-law spectral index prior, templates), and
found that the CMB power spectrum was insensitive to these choices. We confirm
the asymmetry of power between the north and south ecliptic hemispheres, which
appears to be robust against foreground modeling. The map of low frequency
spectral indices indicates a steeper spectrum on average ($\beta=-2.97\pm0.21$)

a spectral index of alpha = 0.47 +/- 0.03 (with alpha defined such that flux
density S varies with frequency nu as S proportional to nu to the power of
-alpha). There is also emission near the centre of the shell, ~1 arcmin in

the conclusion that it is associated with the shell, although its spectrum is
very unlike that of known pulsar wind nebulae.

interacting Brownian particles under steady shearing. We start from exact
expressions for shear-dependent steady-state averages, such as correlation and
structure functions, in the form of generalized Green-Kubo relations. To these
we apply approximations inspired by the mode coupling theory (MCT) for the
quiescent system, accessing steady-state properties by integration through the
transient dynamics after startup of steady shear. Exact equations of motion,
with memory effects, for the required transient density correlation functions
are derived next; these can also be approximated within an MCT-like approach.
This results in closed equations for the non-equilibrium stationary state of
sheared dense colloidal dispersions, with the equilibrium structure factor of
the unsheared system as the only input. In three dimensions, these equations
currently require further approximation prior to numerical solution. However,
some universal aspects can be analyzed exactly, including the discontinuous
onset of a yield stress at the ideal glass transition predicted by MCT. Using
these methods we additionally discuss the distorted microstructure of a sheared
hard-sphere colloid near the glass transition, and consider how this relates to
the shear stress. Time-dependent fluctuations around the stationary state are
then approximated, and compared to data from experiment and simulation; the
correlators for yielding glassy states obey a `time-shear-superposition'
principle. The work presented here fully develops an approach first outlined
previously (M. Fuchs and M. E. Cates, Phys. Rev. Lett. 89, 248304, (2002)),
while incorporating a significant technical change from that work in the choice

agreement with those of previous authors. About 30 blue stragglers were found
within the central 1.6 pc of NGC 6642. They are strongly concentrated to the
very central regions. The cluster displays a well-developed horizontal branch,
with a much redder morphology than that of typical old halo globular clusters
of similar metallicity. Completeness corrected luminosity and mass functions
were obtained for different annuli centred on NGC 6642. Their spatial variation
indicates the existence of mass segregation and depletion of low mass stars.
Most striking is the inverted shape of the mass function itself, with an
increase in number as a function of increasing mass. This has been previously
observed in other globular clusters and is also the result of N-body
simulations of stellar systems which have undergone ~ 90% of their lifetime and
which are subjected to strong tidal effects. We also analysed the density
profile and concluded that NGC 6642 has a collapsed core, provided completeness
effects are correctly accounted for. We thus conclude from independent means
that NGC 6642 is a very old, highly-evolved, core-collapsed globular cluster
with an atypical HB morphology.

for non-conformal branes. Considering the near-horizon limit of backgrounds
generated by such branes, we discuss the holographic renormalization of probe
D-branes in these geometries. More specifically, we discuss in some detail
systems with a codimension-one defect. For this class of systems, the mode
which describes the probe branes wrapping a maximal 2-sphere in the transverse
space behaves like a free massive scalar propagating in a higher-dimensional
(asymptotically) AdS_{q+1}-space. The counterterms needed are then the ones of
a free massive scalar in asymptotically AdS_{q+1}. The original problem can be
recovered by compactifying the AdS-space on a torus and finally performing the
analytic continuation of q to the value of interest, which can be fractional.
We compute the one-point correlator for the operator dual to the embedding
function. We finally comment on holographic renormalization in the more general
cases of codimension-k defects (k=0, 1, 2). In all the cases the embedding
function exhibits the behaviour of a free massive scalar in an AdS-space and,
therefore, the procedure outlined before can be straightforwardly applied. Our
analysis completes the discussion of holographic renormalization of probe
D-branes started by Karch, O'Bannon and Skenderis.

Including previous results for VCC1087, the globular cluster systems of all
three Virgo dwarf ellipticals studied in detail to date exhibit v_rot/sigma >
1. Taking the rotation seen in the globular clusters as maximal disk rotation,
we find all three dEs lie on the r-band Tully-Fisher relation. We argue that
these data support the hypothesis that luminous dEs are the remnants of
transformed disk galaxies. We also obtained deep, longslit data for the stars
in VCC1261 and VCC1528. Both these galaxies show rapid rotation in their inner
regions, with spatial scales of ~0.5 kpc. These rotation velocities are similar
to those seen in the GC systems. Since our longslit data for Virgo dEs extend
out to 1-2 effective radii (typical of deep observations), whereas the globular
clusters extend out to 4--7 effective radii, we conclude that non-detections of
rotation in many luminous dEs may simply be due to a lack of radial coverage in
the stellar data, and that globular clusters represent singularly sensitive
probes of the dynamics of dEs. Based on these data, we suggest that gas disks
are significant sites of globular cluster formation in the early universe.

in the recent peer-to-peer streaming literature. In most of the cases, the
overlay neighbors are chosen randomly for robustness of the overlay. However,
this causes nodes that are distant in terms of proximity in the underlying
physical network to become neighbors, and thus data travels unnecessary
distances before reaching the destination. For efficiency of bulk data
transmission like multimedia streaming, the overlay neighborhood should
resemble the proximity in the underlying network. In this paper, we exploit the
proximity and redundancy properties of a recently proposed clique-based
clustered overlay network, named eQuus, to build efficient as well as robust
overlays for multimedia stream dissemination. To combine the efficiency of
content pushing over tree structured overlays and the robustness of data-driven
mesh overlays, higher capacity stable nodes are organized in tree structure to
carry the long haul traffic and less stable nodes with intermittent presence
are organized in localized meshes. The overlay construction and fault-recovery
procedures are explained in details. Simulation study demonstrates the good
locality properties of the platform. The outage time and control overhead

practice. For total correctness of programs dealing with infinite structures
one must guarantee that every finite part of the result can be evaluated in
finitely many steps. This is known as productivity. For programming with
infinite structures, productivity is what termination in well-defined results
is for programming with finite structures.
  Fractran is a simple Turing-complete programming language invented by Conway.
We prove that the question whether a Fractran program halts on all positive
integers is Pi^0_2-complete. In functional programming, productivity typically
is a property of individual terms with respect to the inbuilt evaluation
strategy. By encoding Fractran programs as specifications of infinite lists, we
establish that this notion of productivity is Pi^0_2-complete even for the most
simple specifications. Therefore it is harder than termination of individual
terms. In addition, we explore possible generalisations of the notion of
productivity in the framework of term rewriting, and prove that their
computational complexity is Pi^1_1-complete, thus exceeding the expressive
power of first-order logic.

arise naturally in quantum theory and quantum information science. To solve
them, we introduce a hierarchy of semidefinite programming relaxations which
generates a monotone sequence of lower bounds that converges to the optimal
solution. We also introduce a criterion to detect whether the global optimum is
reached at a given relaxation step and show how to extract a global optimizer
from the solution of the corresponding semidefinite programming problem.

determination, applied to the popular SUSY decay chain squark -> neutralino ->
slepton -> LSP. We analyze the uniqueness of the solutions for the mass
spectrum in terms of the measured endpoints in the observable invariant mass
distributions. We provide simple analytical inversion formulas for the masses
in terms of the measured endpoints. We show that in a sizable portion of the
SUSY mass parameter space the solutions always suffer from a two-fold
ambiguity, due to the fact that the original relations between the masses and
the endpoints are piecewise-defined functions. The ambiguity persists even in
the ideal case of a perfect detector and infinite statistics. We delineate the
corresponding dangerous regions of parameter space and identify the sets of
""twin"" mass spectra. In order to resolve the ambiguity, we propose a
generalization of the endpoint method, from single-variable distributions to
two-variable distributions. In particular, we study analytically the boundaries
of the (m_{jl(lo)}, m_{jl(hi)}) and (m_{ll}, m_{jll}) distributions and prove
that their shapes are in principle sufficient to resolve the ambiguity in the
mass determination. We identify several additional independent measurements
which can be obtained from the boundary lines of these bivariate distributions.
The purely kinematical nature of our method makes it generally applicable to
any model that exhibits a SUSY-like cascade decay.
