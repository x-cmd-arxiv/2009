implementing a quantum computer. This paper extends and further refines
theoretical foundations and protocols for experimental implementation. We give
a cluster-state implementation of the cubic phase gate through photon
detection, which, together with homodyne detection, facilitates universal
quantum computation. In addition, we characterize the offline squeezed
resources required to generate an arbitrary graph state through passive linear
optics. Most significantly, we prove that there are universal states for which
the offline squeezing per mode does not increase with the size of the cluster.
Simple representations of continuous-variable graph states are introduced to
analyze graph state transformations under measurement and the existence of
universal continuous-variable resource states.

remains difficult to understand. It finds explanation, however, in the New
Explosive Cosmogony of minor bodies as having been caused by an explosion of a
part (M up to 10^12 g) of the comet nucleus whose ices contained products of
its electrolysis, 2H2+O2. In detonation, this part was repelled from the more
massive unexploded nucleus remnant, changed the direction of its own motion by
~10^o and imparted its kinetic energy, in expanding and slowing down, to the
air in producing an effect of a high-altitude explosion. Because there are no
traces of a fall of the more massive remnant, one comes to the conclusion that
on passing through the Earth's atmosphere it again entered a heliocentric orbit
(the hypothesis of V.Vernadskiy, 1932). A search for this comet,
P/Tunguska-1908, among the 6077 known NEAs shows the 2005NB56 object to be the
most appropriate candidate for a number of its parameters (a size is ~ 170 m, P
= 2.106 y, e = 0.473 and i = 6.8^o). Back integration of its orbit made without
allowing for non-gravitational effects suggests that it had passed the Earth on
June 27, 1908 at a distance of 0.06945 AU. It is quite possible that a proper
inclusion of even fairly weak non-gravitational forces would make its orbit fit
in parameters that of the Tunguska bolide.

conserved at the non-planar level. We furthermore observe that, as for ABJM

with an asymmetric warping between space and time warp factors. A perturbative
analysis, in a previous work, gave an energy dependent phase (or group)
velocity of light: $V_{ph}(\omega)=V_{ph}(0)-C_G \:\omega^2 \quad (C_G>0)$,
which was derived up to second order of time independent perturbation theory.
In this paper, we go beyond the perturbative result and we study the
nonperturbative behavior of the phase velocity for larger energies, by solving
numerically an eigenvalue problem for the wave function of the zero mode (4D
photon). In particular we see that $V_{ph}(\omega)$ is in general a
monotonically decreasing function which tends asymptotically to a final value
$V_{ph}(\infty)$. We compare with the results of perturbation theory and we
obtain a very good agreement in the range of small energies. We also present a
wave function analysis and we see that in the nonperturbative sector of the
theory (very high energies), the zero mode and the massive KK modes tend to
decouple from matter localized on the TeV brane.

surface S and a generic enough projection of S to the projective plane, we get
a cover of the plane ramified over a plane curve. The branch curve is usually
singular, but is classically known to have only cusps and nodes as
singularities for a generic projection.
  Several questions arise. First, what is the_geography_ of branch curves among
all nodal-cuspidal curves? Second: what is the_geometry_ of branch curves? In
other words, how can one distinguish a branch curve from a non-branch curve
with the same numerical invariants? For example, a plane sextic curve with six
cusps is known to be a branch curve of a generic projection iff its six cusps
lie on a conic curve, i.e., form a special 0-cycle on the plane.
  We start with reviewing what is known about the answers to these two
questions, mentioning both simple and some non-trivial results. We continue
with study of classical work of Beniamino Segre which gives a complete answer
to the second question in the case when S is a smooth surface in a
three-dimensional projective space. We give an interpretation of Segre's work
in terms of a study of Picard group of 0-cycles on a singular plane curve B.
  We also review examples of small degree.
  The Appendix written by Eugenii Shustin shows the existence of many new
Zariski pairs of plane curves.
  We hope to continue this paper with a generalization to the case of smooth
surfaces in a projective space of any dimension.

phenomena were roughly explained in classical rules such as the liquid drop
model. This fact may be understood that when we see an finite quantum many body
system like nucleus, though which is a group of quantum mechanical particles,
its any collective degree of freedom has any classicality. Getting a
classicality does not depend on spatial scales of objects. It is made by a
phenomenon called Quantum Decoherence. We have studied about Quantum
Decoherence in a finite system as nucleus. In this paper, at the harmonic three
body problem (3 Schroedinger cats), it is shown that one degree of freedom as a
sub-system would get classicality because of the other two degrees of freedom.
Therefore we can assume that a nuclear collective degree of freedom would get
classicality when it couples with any other internal degrees of freedom. In
this paper, we also note that there is some relationship between the Quantum
Decoherence and Crossing of classical orbits in 3 Schroedinger cats model.

acting to reduce their energy consumption. In the coming decades, all citizens
will have to reduce their energy consumption to conserve fossil fuel reserves
and to help avert a potentially catastrophic change in the Earth's climate. The
challenges are the same for astronomers as they are for everyone: decreasing
the distances we travel and investing in energy-efficient infrastructure. The
high profile of astronomy in the media, and the great public interest in our
field, can play a role in promoting energy-awareness to the wider population.
Our specific recommendations are therefore to 1) reduce travel when possible,
through efficient meeting organization, and by investing in high-bandwidth
video conference facilities and virtual-world software, 2) create
energy-efficient observatories, computing centers and workplaces, powered by
sustainable energy resources, and 3) actively publicize these pursuits.

$(x+y)^{n}$, where $n$ is not necessarily a nonnegative integer, is defined as
the formal Taylor series given by the binomial series in nonnegative powers of
the second-listed variable (namely, $y$). We present a viewpoint that for some
purposes of generalization of the formal calculus including and beyond
""logarithmic formal calculus"", it seems useful, using the formal Taylor theorem
as a guide, to instead take as the definition of $(x+y)^{n}$ the formal series
which is the result of acting on $x^{n}$ by a formal translation operator, a
certain exponentiated derivation. These differing approaches are equivalent,
and in the standard generality of formal calculus or logarithmic formal
calculus there is no reason to prefer one approach over the other. However,
using this second point of view, we may more easily, and in fact do, consider
extensions in two directions, sometimes in conjunction. The first extension is
to replace $x^{n}$ by more general objects such as the formal variable $\log
x$, which appears in the logarithmic formal calculus, and also, more
interestingly, by iterated-logarithm expressions. The second extension is to
replace the formal translation operator by a more general formal change of
variable operator. In addition, we note some of the combinatorics underlying
the formal calculus which we treat, and we end by briefly mentioning a
connection to Fa\`a di Bruno's classical formula for the higher derivatives of
a composite function and the classical umbral calculus. Many of these results

proposed methods in the literature, the generalized profiling estimation method
developed by Ramsay and colleagues is particularly promising for its
computational efficiency and good performance. In this approach, the ODE
solution is approximated with a linear combination of basis functions. The

this procedure is asymptotically efficient. For a fixed sample and fixed basis

that over a 10 year period it will travel a distance of ~800 AU. As first noted

measurements of quasar parallaxes, so that only microarcsecond precision is
necessary to detect parallax shifts of objects at gigaparsec distances. Such
precision will soon be approached with the launch of the astrometric satellites
Gaia and SIM. We use a Fisher matrix formalism to investigate the constraints
that these and future missions may be able to place on the cosmological
distance scale and dark energy. We find that by observing around a million
quasars as planned, an extended 10 year Gaia mission could detect quasar
parallax shifts at the 2.8 sigma level and so measure the Hubble constant to
within 25 km/s. For the interferometer SIMLite, a Key Project using 2.4 % of
the total mission time to observe 750 quasars could detect the effect at the 2
sigma level. Gaia and a dedicated SIMLite only weakly constrain the presence of
a cosmological constant at the ~1 sigma levels. We also investigate future
mission concepts, such as an interferometer similar in scope and design to
NASA's Terrestrial Planet Finder. This could in principle measure the dark
energy parameters w_0 and w_a with high precision, yielding a Figure of Merit
larger than the stage IV experiments considered by the the Dark Energy Task

  Our analysis indicates that in these regions a) the emission of the dust is
at the expected level for their luminosity and metallicity, b) the usual
tracers of star formation rate display the typical trend and scatter found in
classical star forming regions, and c) the extinction and metallicity are not
the main parameters governing the scatter in the properties of intergalactic
star forming regions; age effects and variations in the number of stellar
populations, seem to play an important role. Our work suggests that local
properties such as column density and dust content, rather than the large scale

concordance LCDM cosmology shifted the focus of galaxy population studies from
constraining cosmological parameters to characterizing the processes which
regulate the formation and evolution of galaxies.In the next decade, high
redshift observers will attempt to formulate a coherent evolutionary picture
connecting galaxies in the high redshift Universe to galaxies today. In order
to link galaxy populations at different redshifts, we must not only
characterize their evolution in a systematic way, we must establish which
physical processes are responsible for it. Considerable progress has already
been made in understanding how galaxies evolved from z ~ 1 to the present day.
Large spectroscopic surveys in the near infrared are required to push these
studies back towards the main epoch of galaxy building. Only then will we
understand the full story of the formation of L* galaxies like our own Milky
Way. A large near-IR spectroscopic survey will also provide the calibration
needed to avoid systematics in the large photometric programs proposed to study

atmospheric molecular absorbers. Contrary to a previous analysis of the same
dataset, our study is robust against systematics and reveals that water vapor
absorption at 5.8 micron is not detected in this photometric dataset.
Furthermore, in the band centered around 4.5 micron we find a hint of excess
absorption with an apparent planetary radius Delta(R_p/R_*) = 0.00128 +/-
0.00056 larger (2.3 sigma) than the one measured simultaneously at 8 micron.
This value is 4 sigma above what would be expected for an atmosphere where
water vapor is the only absorbing species in the near infrared. This shows that
an additional species absorbing around 4.5 micron could be present in the
atmosphere. CO being a strong absorber at this wavelength is a possible
candidate and this may suggest a large CO/H2O ratio between 5 and 60.

considerable detail because of discrepant values of solar metallicity inferred
from different indicators, i.e., on the one hand, the ""sub-solar"" photospheric
abundances resulting from spectroscopic chemical composition analyses with the
aid of 3D hydrodynamical models of the solar atmosphere, and, on the other
hand, the high metallicity inferred by helioseismology. AIMS: After
investigating the solar oxygen abundance using a CO5BOLD 3D hydrodynamical
solar model in previous work, we undertake a similar approach studying the
solar abundance of nitrogen, since this element accounts for a significant
fraction of the overall solar metallicity, Z. METHOD: We used a selection of
atomic spectral lines to determine the solar nitrogen abundance, relying mainly
on equivalent width measurements in the literature. We investigate the
influence on the abundance analysis, of both deviations from local
thermodynamic equilibrium (""NLTE effects"") and photospheric inhomogeneities
(""granulation effects""). RESULTS: We recommend use of a solar nitrogen
abundance of A(N)=7.86+-0.12 whose error bar reflects the line-to-line scatter.
CONCLUSION: The solar metallicity implied by the CO5BOLD-based nitrogen and
oxygen abundances is in the range 0.0145<= Z <= 0.0167. This result is a step
towards reconciling photospheric abundances with helioseismic constraints on Z.
Our most suitable estimates are Z=0.0156 and Z/X=0.0213.

antiferromagnet using a large-$N$ Sp($N$) mean field theory and a projective
symmetry group analysis for possible bosonic quantum spin liquid phases. It is
found that there exist only two distinct gapped $Z_2$ spin liquid phases with
bosonic spinons for non-vanishing nearest-neighbor valence-bond-amplitudes. In
particular, the spin liquid phase which has a lower energy in the
nearest-neighbor exchange model can be stabilized for relatively higher spin
magnitudes. Hence it is perhaps a better candidate for the realization of
quantum spin liquid state. We also determine the magnetic ordering patterns
resulting from the condensation of the bosonic spinons in the two different
spin liquid phases. We expect these magnetic ordering patterns would directly
be relevant for the low temperature ordered phase of the Iron Acetate. The

for the equation of state parameter $w$ as a function of the scale factor for

quintessence models, when $(1/V)(d^2 V/d\phi^2)<3/4$ at the potential minimum,
the equation of state parameter $w(a)$ evolves monotonically, while for
$(1/V)(d^2 V/d\phi^2)>3/4$, $w(a)$ has oscillatory behavior. For phantom
fields, the dividing line between these two types of behavior is at $(1/V)(d^2

0.05, corresponding to luminosities of approximately L* and above, and with u-r

in lower-density environments than `normal' red sequence early-types and make
up 5.7 +/-0.4% of the low-redshift early-type galaxy population. We find that
such blue early-type galaxies are virtually absent at high velocity dispersions
above 200 km/s. Our analysis uses emission line diganostic diagrams and we find
that ~25% of them are actively starforming, while another ~25% host both star
formation and an AGN. Another ~12% are AGN. The remaining 38% show no strong
emission lines. When present and uncontaminated by an AGN contribution, the
star formation is generally intense. We consider star formation rates derived
from Halpha, u-band and infrared luminosities, and radial colour profiles, and
conclude that the star formation is spatially extended. Of those objects that
are not currently undergoing star formation must have ceased doing so recently

at the ESO VLT, as well as with XMM-Newton at X-ray (2-10 keV) wavelengths. On
4 April, 2007, a very bright flare was observed from Sgr A* simultaneously at
L'-band and X-ray wavelengths. No emission was detected using VISIR. The
resulting SED has a blue slope (beta > 0 for nuL_nu ~ nu^beta, consistent with
nuL_nu ~ nu^0.4) between 12 micron and 3.8 micron.
  For the first time our high quality data allow a detailed comparison of
infrared and X-ray light curves with a resolution of a few minutes. The IR and
X-ray flares are simultaneous to within 3 minutes. However the IR flare lasts
significantly longer than the X-ray flare (both before and after the X-ray
peak) and prominent substructures in the 3.8 micron light curve are clearly not
seen in the X-ray data. From the shortest timescale variations in the L'-band
lightcurve we find that the flaring region must be no more than 1.2 R_S in
size.
  The high X-ray to infrared flux ratio, blue nuL_nu slope MIR to L' -band, and
the soft nuL_nu spectral index of the X-ray flare together place strong
constraints on possible flare emission mechanisms. We find that it is
quantitatively difficult to explain this bright X-ray flare with inverse
Compton processes. A synchrotron emission scenario from an electron
distribution with a cooling break is a more viable scenario.

term, as seen from the vortex worldsheet perspective. Together with the FI term
$\xi$, also a mass $\mu$ for the adjoint superfield $\Phi$ enters in the game.
This mass allows the interpolation between $\N=2$ and $\N=1$ super-QCD. While
the phenomenology of the $\N=2$ case ($\mu=0$) is pretty much understood, much
remains to be clarified for the finite-$\mu$ case. We distinguish, inside the
parameter space spanned by the FI term and the mass $\mu$, four different
corners where some quantitative statements can be made. These are the regions
where the strong dynamics can, in some approximation, be quantitatively
analyzed. We focus in particular on two questions: 1) Is the quantum vortex BPS
or non-BPS? 2) What is the phase of the internal non-Abelian moduli? We find
that the answer to these questions strongly depends upon the choice of the
linear term in the superpotential. We also try to explain what happens in the
most unexplored, and controversial, region of parameters, that of the quantum
heterotic vortex, where $\Lambda \ll \sqrt{\xi} \ll \mu$.

non-zero node amplitudes in samples with the narrowest broadening despite the
presence of a large g-factor. The beating is attributed to Rashba splitting
phenomenon and Rashba coupling parameters are extracted from the difference in
spin populations for a range of samples and gate biases. The influence of
Landau level broadening and spin-dependent scattering rates on the observation
of beating in the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations is investigated by simulations
of the magnetoconductance. Data with non-zero beat node amplitudes are
accompanied by asymmetric peaks in the Fourier transform, which are
successfully reproduced by introducing a spin-dependent broadening in the
simulations. It is found that the low-energy (majority) spin up state suffers
more scattering than the high-energy (minority) spin down state and that the
absence of beating patterns in the majority of (lower density) samples can be
attributed to the same effect when the magnitude of the level broadening is

constant thickness along their length. Various studies have found no consistent
pattern of width variation along the length of loops observed by TRACE and

properties, which suggests that loops are widest at their tops, and
significantly narrower at their footpoints. Coronal loops correspond to areas
of the solar corona which have been preferentially heated by some process, so
this observed property might be connected to the mechanisms that heat the
corona. One means of energy deposition is magnetic reconnection, which occurs
along field lines called separators. These field lines begin and end on
magnetic null points, and loops forming near them can therefore be relatively
wide at their bases. Thus, coronal energization by magnetic reconnection may
replicate the puzzling expansion properties observed in coronal loops. We
present results of a Monte Carlo survey of separator field line expansion
properties, comparing them to the observed properties of coronal loops.

understanding the mechanism of accretion onto supermassive black holes, and the
related evolution of the host galaxy. In this work, we include objects with
very low Eddington ratio (10^{-3} - 10^{-2}) in an evolution scenario, and
compare the results with the observed local distribution of black holes. We
test several possibilities for the AGN population, considering obscuration and
dependence with luminosity, and investigate the role of the Eddington ratio and
radiative accretion efficiency on the shape of the evolved mass function. We
find that three distinct populations of AGN can evolve with a wider parameter
range than is usually considered, and still be consistent with the local mass
function. In general, the black holes in our solutions are spinning rapidly.
Taking fixed values for accretion efficiency and Eddington ratio neither
provides a full knowledge of the evolution mechanism nor is consistent with the
existence of low Eddington ratio objects.

information theory by introducing the notion of thermodynamic quantities at
temperature T, such as free energy F(T), energy E(T), and statistical
mechanical entropy S(T), into the theory. These quantities are real functions
of real argument T>0. We then discovered that, in the interpretation, the
temperature T equals to the partial randomness of the values of all these
thermodynamic quantities, where the notion of partial randomness is a stronger
representation of the compression rate by program-size complexity. Furthermore,
we showed that this situation holds for the temperature itself as a
thermodynamic quantity. Namely, the computability of the value of partition
function Z(T) gives a sufficient condition for T in (0,1) to be a fixed point
on partial randomness. In this paper, we show that the computability of each of
all the thermodynamic quantities above gives the sufficient condition also.
Moreover, we show that the computability of F(T) gives completely different
fixed points from the computability of Z(T).

hypothesis for their origin is that they are captured asteroids, but the
mechanism requires an extremely dense martian atmosphere, and the mechanism by
which an asteroid in solar orbit could shed sufficient orbital energy to be
captured into Mars orbit has not been well elucidated. Since the discovery by
the space probe Galileo that the asteroid Ida has a moon ""Dactyl"", a
significant number of asteroids have been discovered to have smaller asteroids
in orbit about them. The existence of asteroid moons provides a mechanism for
the capture of the Martian moons (and the small moons of the outer planets).
When a binary asteroid makes a close approach to a planet, tidal forces can
strip the moon from the asteroid. Depending on the phasing, the asteroid can
then be captured. Clearly, the same process can be used to explain the origin
of any of the small moons in the solar system.

uses the quantum Bell states, and applies unitary transformations in the
authentication process. Then it exploits and utilizes the entanglement swapping
and local unitary operations in the communication processes. Thus, after the
authentication process, the client users are left alone to communicate with
each other, and the authenticator has no access to the secrete message. In
addition, our protocol does not require a direct quantum link between any two
users, who want to communicate with each other. This may also be an appealing
advantage in the implementation of a practical quantum communication network.

thermal conductivity is only slightly higher than that of high-quality bulk
graphite along the basal plane, and that it does not strongly depend on the
number of atomic layers. Here we explain that the calculation of Kong et al
used a truncation procedure with a 'hidden' parameter, a cut-off frequency for
the long-wavelength acoustic phonons, which essentially determined the final
result. Unlike in bulk graphite, there is no physical justification for
introducing the cut-off frequency for the long wavelength phonons in graphene.
It leads to substantial underestimation of graphene's lattice thermal

atomic layers. We outline the proper way for calculating the lattice thermal
conductivity of graphene, which requires an introduction of other scattering
mechanisms to avoid a logarithmic divergence of the thermal conductivity
integral.

state when the Maki parameter \alpha increases. The pure FFLO state,
characterized by finite center-of-mass momenta q \ne 0 of Cooper pairs occurs
in the two-dimensional limit, when the magnetic field is parallel to the
conductive plane. The vectors q are determined from the Fermi-surface structure
and pairing anisotropy, and become finite below a temperature T^*. In
quasi-two-dimensions, because of the orbital pair-breaking effect, the
coexistence state characterized by (n,q//) occurs, where n and q// denote the
Landau level index of the vortex state and the wave number of the additional
FFLO modulation along the magnetic field. We obtain the \alpha dependence of
the upper critical field by numerical calculations. The upper critical field
exhibits a cascade curve in the H-T phase diagram. It is analytically shown
that n diverges in the two-dimensional limit \alpha \to \infty below T^*. In
this limit, the upper critical field equation of the coexistence state is
reduced to that of the FFLO state. A relation between n of the coexistence
state and q_{\perp} of the pure FFLO state is obtained, where q_{\perp} denotes
the component of q perpendicular to the magnetic field. It is found that the
pure FFLO state is nothing but the vortex state with infinitely large n as is
known in two-dimensional superconductors in a tilted magnetic field. The vortex
state with large n can be regarded as the FFLO state with non-zero q_{\perp} in
three dimensions.

  Using this approach we are able to construct the finite dimensional
irreducible representations of an inverse semigroup over an arbitrary field as
induced representations from associated groups, generalizing the well-studied
case of an inverse semigroup with finitely many idempotents. More generally, we
describe the irreducible representations of an inverse semigroup $S$ that can

metal-rich central region ([Fe/H]=+0.25 dex). If a merger or interaction is
responsible for triggering the starburst, the presence of this undisturbed disc
suggests a minor merger with a gas-rich satellite as the most plausible option,
rather than a disruptive major merger. We find spectroscopic evidence for the
presence of a LINER or AGN. This is an important clue to the feedback mechanism
that truncated the starburst. The presently observed quiescent phase may well
be a temporary episode in the galaxy's life. SDSS J230743.41+152558.4 is

the presence of strong abundance gradients in their atmospheres. However, these
inhomogeneities are usually ignored in the standard scheme of model atmosphere
calculations, braking the consistency between model structure and
spectroscopically derived abundance pattern. In this paper we present first
empirical self-consistent stellar atmosphere model of roAp star HD24712, with
stratification of chemical elements included, and which is derived directly
from the observed profiles of spectral lines without time-consuming simulations
of physical mechanisms responsible for these anomalies. We used the LLmodels
stellar model atmosphere code and DDAFIT minimization tool for analysis of
chemical elements stratification and construction of self-consistent
atmospheric model. Empirical determination of Pr and Nd stratification in the
atmosphere of HD24712 is based on NLTE line formation for Prii/iii and Ndii/iii
with the use of the DETAIL code. Based on iterative procedure of stratification
analysis and subsequent re-calculation of model atmosphere structure we
constructed a self-consistent model of HD24712, i.e. the model which
temperature-pressure structure is consistent with results of stratification
analysis. It is shown that stratification of chemical elements leads to the
considerable changes in model structure as to compare with non-stratified
homogeneous case. We find that accumulation of REE elements allows for the
inverse temperature gradient to be present in upper atmosphere of the star with
the maximum temperature increase of about 600K.

Poincar\' e plots are computed and used for evaluation of the degree of
chaoticity with the box-counting method. The limit of the fully chaotic
behavior is identified with circular arcs. Above this limit, for flattened
elliptical arcs, mixed dynamics with numerous stable elliptic islands is
present, similarly as in the elliptical stadium billiards. Below this limit the
full chaos extends over the whole region of elongated shapes and the existing
orbits are either unstable or neutral. This is conspicuously different from the
behavior in the elliptical stadium billiards, where the chaotic region is
strictly bounded from both sides. To examine the mechanism of this difference,
a generalization to a novel three-parameter family of boundary shapes is

I also insist on limitations inherent to these models. Estimates of collisional
and radiative time scales for electronic transitions in e.g. TiO suggest that
non-LTE effects are important, and should be further investigated. Classical 1D
models are not capable either to provide the large and non-gaussian velocity

current efforts in 3D radiative hydrodynamical simulation of RSGs. I show that
line profiles and shifts are predicted by these simulations, without the need
for fudge micro- and macroturbulence velocities. This is a great progress,
although line depths and widths are slightly too shallow. This is probably
caused by the simplified grey radiative transfer used in these heavy

behavior of the geodesic flow in a neighbourhood of a singularity, classifying
the possible singularities both from a formal point of view and (for generic

transmitter then describes its source component to the common receiver via an
average-power constrained Gaussian multiple-access channel. From the resulting
channel output, the receiver wishes to reconstruct both source components with
the least possible expected squared-error distortion. We study the set of
distortion pairs that can be achieved by the receiver on the two source
components.
  We present sufficient conditions and necessary conditions for the
achievability of a distortion pair. These conditions are expressed in terms of
the source correlation and of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the channel.
In several cases the necessary conditions and sufficient conditions coincide.
This allows us to show that if the channel SNR is below a certain threshold,
then an uncoded transmission scheme that ignores the feedback is optimal. Thus,
below this SNR-threshold feedback is useless. We also derive the precise
high-SNR asymptotics of optimal schemes.

oleic acid, in which oleic acid/oleate forms vesicular bilayer structures, was
qualitatively different from the behavior upon transfer into a 0.3 mM
suspension of oleic acid/oleate, in which oleic acid/oleate is predominantly
present in the form of monomers and possibly non-vesicular aggregates. In both
cases, changes in vesicle morphology were observed within tens of seconds after
the transfer. Vesicle initially started to evaginate. In 60% of the cases of
transfer into a 0.8 mM oleic acid suspension, the evagination process reversed
and proceeded to the point where the membrane formed invaginations. In some of
these cases, several consecutive transitions between invaginated and evaginated
shapes were observed. In the remaining 40% of the cases of transfer into the
0.8 mM oleic acid uspension and in all cases of vesicle transfer into the 0.3
mM oleic acid suspension, no invaginations nor subsequent evaginations were

a deterministic dynamics, in this review, and we consider that the dynamics of

rather simple framework and to propose a review with concrete numerical values,
results and formula on (i) general time constraints, (ii) links between
continuous signals and spike trains, (iii) spiking networks parameter
adjustments. When implementing spiking neuron networks, for computational or

indisputable facts here reviewed. This precaution could prevent from
implementing mechanisms meaningless with regards to obvious time constraints,
or from introducing spikes artificially, when continuous calculations would be
sufficient and simpler. It is also pointed out that implementing a spiking

decomposition (FD) method as tools for variable star diagnostics and compare
their relative performance in studying the changes in the light curve
structures of pulsating Cepheids and in the classification of variable stars.
Methods: We have calculated the Fourier parameters of 17,606 light curves of a
variety of variables, e.g., RR Lyraes, Cepheids, Mira Variables and extrinsic
variables for our analysis. We have also performed PCA on the same database of
light curves. The inputs to the PCA are the 100 values of the magnitudes for
each of these 17,606 light curves in the database interpolated between phase 0
to 1. Unlike some previous studies, Fourier coefficients are not used as input
to the PCA. Results: We show that in general, the first few principal
components (PCs) are enough to reconstruct the original light curves compared
to FD method where 2 to 3 times more number of parameters are required to
satisfactorily reconstruct the light curves. The computation of required number
of Fourier parameters on the average needs 20 times more CPU time than the
computation of required number of PCs. Therefore, PCA does have some advantage
over the FD method in analysing the variable stars in a larger database.
However in some cases, particularly in finding the resonances in Fundamental
mode (FU) Cepheids, the PCA results show no distinct advantages over the FD
method. We also demonstrate that the PCA technique can be used to classify
variables into different variability classes in an automated, unsupervised way,
a feature that has immense potential for larger databases of the future.

also derived. Causality suggests that the role of completeness in many results
of Riemannian Geometry (geodesic connectedness by minimizing geodesics,
Bonnet-Myers, Synge theorems) is played, in Finslerian Geometry, by the
compactness of symmetrized closed balls. Moreover, under this condition we show
that for any Randers metric there exists another Randers metric with the same
pregeodesics and geodesically complete. Even more, results on the
differentiability of Cauchy horizons in spacetimes yield consequences for the
differentiability of the Randers distance to a subset, and vice versa.

good test of the perturbative QCD and the important base line to study the
medium created in Au+Au collisions at RHIC. The behavior of bottom in the
medium is expected to be largely different from that of charm. Therefore, the
determination of the fraction of bottom in the electrons from heavy flavor is
necessary to understand the behavior of heavy quarks in the matter.
  The first separate measurement of charm and bottom via partial reconstruction
of $D/\bar{D} \to e^{\pm} K^{\mp} X$ decay has been carried out in $p+p$

in the electrons from heavy flavor above 3 GeV/$c$. The total cross section of

also bottom quarks lose a large fraction of their energy in the medium.

to the appearance of strong abundance gradients in the atmospheres of CP stars.
Consequently, the atmospheric temperature-pressure structure of these objects
could deviate significantly from the atmospheres of normal stars with
homogeneous abundances. In this study we performed a self-consistent, empirical
model atmosphere study of the brightest rapidly oscillating Ap star alpha Cir.
We account for chemical stratification in the model atmosphere calculations and
assess the importance of non-uniformed vertical element distribution on the
model structure, energy distribution and hydrogen line profiles. Based on an
iterative procedure of the chemical abundance analysis of 52 ions of 35
elements, stratification modeling of 4 elements (Si, Ca, Cr and Fe) and
subsequent re-calculations of the atmospheric structure, we derived a new model
atmosphere of alpha Cir, which is consistent with the inferred atmospheric
chemistry of the star. We find Teff=7500 K, logg=4.1, and demonstrate that
chemical stratification has a noticeable impact on the model structure and
modifies the formation of the hydrogen Balmer lines. Our spectroscopically
determined Teff of alpha Cir agrees with the fundamental effective temperature
of this star. This shows that temperatures inferred in detailed spectroscopic
analyses of cool magnetic CP stars are not affected by a large systematic bias.

O2, has been detected to date. We analyse ISOCAM-CVF spectral image data toward
rho Oph A to derive the temperatures and column densities of H2 at the
locations of ISO-LWS observations of two [OI] 3P_J lines. The intensity ratios
of the (J=1-2) 63um to (J=0-1) 145um lines largely exceed ten, attesting to the
fact that these lines are optically thin. This is confirmed by radiative
transfer calculations, making these lines suitable for abundance
determinations. For that purpose, we calculate line strengths and compare them
to the LWS observations. Excess [OI] emission is observed to be associated with
the molecular outflow from VLA 1623. For this region, we determine the physical
parameters, T and N(H2), from the CAM observations and the gas density, n(H2),
is determined from the flux ratio of the [O I]63um and [O I]145um lines. For
the oxygen abundance, our analysis leads to essentially three possibilities:
(1) Extended low density gas with standard ISM O-abundance, (2) Compact high
density gas with standard ISM O-abundance and (3) Extended high density gas
with reduced oxygen abundance, [O/H] ~ 2E-5. As option (1) disregards valid [O
I] 145um data, we do not find it very compelling; we favour option (3), as
lower abundances are expected as a result of chemical cloud evolution, but we

being addressed is the scaling of the turbulent diffusion coefficient with the
fluctuation strength in the limit of slow fluctuation frequencies (large Kubo
numbers). In this limit, the transport is found to exhibit pseudochaotic,
rather than simply chaotic, properties associated with the vanishing
Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy and anomalously slow mixing of phase space
trajectories. Based on a simple random walk model, we find the low-frequency,
percolation scaling of the turbulent diffusion coefficient to be given by
$D/\omega\propto Q^{2/3}$ (here $Q\gg 1$ is the Kubo number and $\omega$ is the
characteristic fluctuation frequency). When the pseudochaotic property is
relaxed the percolation scaling is shown to cross over to Bohm scaling. The
features of turbulent transport in the pseudochaotic regime are described
statistically in terms of a time fractional diffusion equation with the
fractional derivative in the Caputo sense. Additional physics effects
associated with finite particle inertia are considered.

field modulation of the critical current in small Bi-2212 mesa structures with
different sizes. A clear Fraunhofer-like modulation is observed when the field

periodicity of modulation is equal to half the flux quantum per intrinsic

the periodicity is changed to one flux quantum, characteristic to the

definition proposed by G.J. Chaitin and A.N. Kolmogorov is revisited for the
dynamical complexity of music. When music pieces are cast in the form of time
series of pitch variations, concepts of dynamical systems theory can be used to
define new quantities such as the {\em dimensionality} as a measure of the {\em
global temporal dynamics} of a music piece, and the Shanon {\em entropy} as an
evaluation of its {\em local dynamics}. When these quantities are computed
explicitly for sequences sampled in the music literature from the 18th to the
20th century, no indication is found of a systematic increase in complexity
paralleling historically the evolution of classical western music, but the
analysis suggests that the fractional nature of art might have an intrinsic
value of more general significance.

oscillations with periodicities ranging from 126 to 700 seconds originating
above the bright point and significance levels exceeding 99%. These
oscillations, 2.6 kilometers per second in amplitude, are coupled with
chromospheric line-of-sight Doppler velocities with an average blue shift of 23
kilometers per second. A lack of cospatial intensity oscillations and
transversal displacements rules out the presence of magneto-acoustic wave
modes. The oscillations are a signature of Alfven waves produced by a torsional
twist of +/-22 degrees. A phase shift of 180 degrees across the diameter of the
bright point suggests that these torsional Alfven oscillations are induced
globally throughout the entire brightening. The energy flux associated with
this wave mode is sufficient to heat the solar corona.

Essential selfadjointness of these matrices turns out to depend on the

the matrix is always essentially selfadjoint independently of the growth of its

complexity of their modes algebra, offer the simplest context for the study of
the bases of states and their different combinatorial representations. Three
bases are known. The classic one is given by strings of the fundamental
parafermionic operators whose sequences of modes are in correspondence with
restricted partitions with parts at distance k-1 differing at least by 2.
Another basis is expressed in terms of the ordered modes of the k-1 different
parafermionic fields, which are in correspondence with the so-called multiple
partitions. Both types of partitions have a natural (Bressoud) path
representation. Finally, a third basis, formulated in terms of different paths,
is inherited from the solution of the restricted solid-on-solid model of
Andrews-Baxter-Forrester. The aim of this work is to review, in a unified and
pedagogical exposition, these four different combinatorial representations of
the states of the Z_k parafermionic models.
  The first part of this article presents the different paths and partitions
and their bijective relations; it is purely combinatorial, self-contained and
elementary; it can be read independently of the conformal-field-theory
applications. The second part links this combinatorial analysis with the bases
of states of the Z_k parafermionic theories. With the prototypical example of
the parafermionic models worked out in detail, this analysis contributes to fix
some foundations for the combinatorial study of more complicated theories.
Indeed, as we briefly indicate in ending, generalized versions of both the
Bressoud and the Andrews-Baxter-Forrester paths emerge naturally in the
description of the minimal models.

  English and Portuguese versions",,,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Black holes have their proper oscillations, which are called the quasi-normal
modes. The proper oscillations of astrophysical black holes can be observed in
the nearest future with the help of gravitational wave detectors. Quasi-normal
modes are also very important in the context of testing of the stability of
black objects, the anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT)
correspondence and in higher dimensional theories, such as the brane-world
scenarios and string theory.
  This dissertation reviews a number of works, which provide a thorough study
of the quasi-normal spectrum of a wide class of black holes in four and higher
dimensions for fields of various spin and gravitational perturbations. We have
studied numerically the dependance of the quasi-normal modes on a number of
factors, such as the presence of the cosmological constant, the Gauss-Bonnet
parameter or the aether in the space-time, the dependance of the spectrum on
parameters of the black hole and fields under consideration. By the analysis of
the quasi-normal spectrum, we have studied the stability of higher dimensional
Reissner-Nordstrom-de Sitter black holes, Kaluza-Klein black holes with
squashed horizons, Gauss-Bonnet black holes and black strings. Special
attention is paid to the evolution of massive fields in the background of
various black holes. We have considered their quasi-normal ringing and the
late-time tails. In addition, we present two new numerical techniques: a
generalisation of the Nollert improvement of the Frobenius method for higher
dimensional problems and a qualitatively new method, which allows to calculate
quasi-normal frequencies for black holes, which metrics are not known
analytically.

energy band of the BAT telescope.
