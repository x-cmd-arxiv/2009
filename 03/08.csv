computations, we evaluate the scattering of open strings off D-particles in
brane world scenarios. The D-particles are viewed as D3 branes wrapped up
around three cycles, and their embedding in brane worlds constitutes a case of
intersecting branes, among which strings are stretched, representing various
types of excitations of the Standard Model (SM) particles in the low-energy
limit. Our analysis, reveals interesting and novel selection rules for the
resulting causal time delays, proportional to the energy of the incident matter
state, from the processes of splitting, capture and re-emission of the latter
by the D-particles. In particular, we show that there are relatively large time
delays only for excitations that belong to the Cartan subalgebra of the SM
gauge group, which notably includes photons. We discuss the possible relevance
of these results to the models of space time foam predicting a non-trivial
vacuum refractive index for photons and the associated cosmic \gamma-ray
phenomenology. In particular, we demonstrate how low-string-scale models can be
falsified already in this context, by current astrophysical observations of
cosmic photons, and how such observations serve as a way to discriminate low-
from high-string scale models.

also extending back to 1899 with archival plates. In addition, a sinusoidal
modulation of amplitude 0.2 mag and period 103.8+-0.4 days is seen mainly in
the red, with this attributed to ordinary pulsations in the giant companion
star. V394 CrA has an orbital period equal to twice its primary photometric
period (P_orb=1.515682+-0.000008 days), as based on photometry extending from
1989-2008. I use all available information (including the UBVRIJHK spectral
energy distributions) to get distances to the four RNe with red giant
companions as 800+-140 pc for T CrB, 4300+-700 pc for RS Oph, 7300+-1200 pc for
V745 Sco, and 6000+-1000 pc for V3890 Sgr. Further, the red giant in the RS Oph
system has a mass loss rate of close to 3.7x10^-8 M_sun/yr as based on many
confident measures, and this is too weak (by a factor of 100,000) to supply the
white dwarf with mass at the known rate of 3.9x10^-6 M_sun/yr. Thus, the only
way to get matter onto the white dwarf fast enough is through Roche lobe
overflow, and this confidently demonstrates that the distance to RS Oph is
>~3000 pc.

quite relevant effects, if retardation of the forces and discreteness of matter

found to be determined by the density of the far away matter, i.e., by the
density of matter at remote times. This leads to the introduction of an
effective density, which has to be five times larger than the present one, if
the present expansion rate is to be accounted for. The force per unit mass on a
test particle is found to be of the order of 0.2cH_0. The corresponding
contribution to the virial of the forces for a cluster of galaxies is also
discussed, and it is shown that it fits the observations if a decorrelation

sdB-type primary and a fully convective secondary. We have monitored this
eclipsing binary for more than 2 years and as a result, 32 times of light
minimum were obtained. Based on our new eclipse times together with these
compiled from the literature, it is discovered that the O-C curve of HS
0705+6700 shows a cyclic variation with a period of 7.15 years and a
semiamplitude of 92.4 s. The periodic change was analyzed for the light-travel
time effect that may be due to the presence of a tertiary companion. The mass
of the third body is determined to be M3 sin i = 0.0377 (+/-0.0043) Msun when a
total mass of 0.617 Msun for HS 0705+6700 is adopted. For orbital inclinations
i >= 32.8, the mass of the tertiary component would be below the stable
hydrogen-burning limit of M3~0.072 Msun, and thus it would be a brown dwarf.
The third body is orbiting the sdB-type binary at a distance shorter than 3.6
astronomical units (AU). HS 0705+6700 was formed through the evolution of a
common envelope after the primary becomes a red giant. The detection of a
sub-stellar companion in HS 0705+6700 system at this distance from the binary
could give some constraints on stellar evolution in such systems and the
interactions between red giants and their companions.

locating and characterizing the highest density regions in the interstellar
medium. In particular, the early stages of massive star formation remain poorly
understood. Our goal is to produce a large-scale, systematic database of
massive pre- and proto-stellar clumps in the Galaxy, to understand how and
under what conditions star formation takes place. A well characterized sample
of star-forming sites will deliver an evolutionary sequence and a mass function
of high-mass, star-forming clumps. This systematic survey at submm wavelengths
also represents a preparatory work for Herschel and ALMA. The APEX telescope is
ideally located to observe the inner Milky Way. The Large APEX Bolometer Camera
(LABOCA) is a 295-element bolometer array observing at 870 microns, with a beam
size of 19"". Taking advantage of its large field of view (11.4') and excellent
sensitivity, we started an unbiased survey of the Galactic Plane, with a noise
level of 50-70 mJy/beam: the APEX Telescope Large Area Survey of the Galaxy
(ATLASGAL). As a first step, we covered 95 sq. deg. These data reveal 6000
compact sources brighter than 0.25 Jy, as well as extended structures, many of
them filamentary. About two thirds of the compact sources have no bright
infrared counterpart, and some of them are likely to correspond to the
precursors of (high-mass) proto-stars or proto-clusters. Other compact sources
harbor hot cores, compact HII regions or young embedded clusters. Assuming a
typical distance of 5 kpc, most sources are clumps smaller than 1 pc with
masses from a few 10 to a few 100 M_sun. In this introductory paper, we show
preliminary results from these ongoing observations, and discuss the
perspectives of the survey.

unfolding of W, and oscillatory integrals produce a Frobenius manifold
structure on this universal unfolding. We show that W can be deformed by
counting Maslov index two tropical disks, and the natural paramaters appearing
in this deformation are then the flat coordinates on the moduli space.
Furthermore, the oscillatory integrals are shown to read off directly tropical
curve counts from the potential. Thus we show in fact that mirror symmetry for
P^2 is equivalent in a strong sense to tropical curve counting formulas,
including tropical formulas for gravitational descendent invariants.

channels is investigated, and the dependence of this overhead on various system
parameters of interest (e.g., fading rate, signal-to-noise ratio) is
quantified. The achievable pilot-based spectral efficiency is expanded with
respect to the fading rate about the no-fading point, which leads to an
accurate order expansion for the pilot overhead. This expansion identifies that
the pilot overhead, as well as the spectral efficiency penalty with respect to
a reference system with genie-aided CSI (channel state information) at the
receiver, depend on the square root of the normalized Doppler frequency.
Furthermore, it is shown that the widely-used block fading model is only a
special case of more accurate continuous fading models in terms of the

for multiantenna systems is effectively the same as for single-antenna systems
with the normalized Doppler frequency multiplied by the number of transmit

fundamentally linked to the Cartan connection, it may also be arrived at
geometrically by viewing a conformal manifold as the space of null rays in a
Lorentzian ambient space. For dimension d conformally flat manifolds we show
that the (d+2)-dimensional Fefferman--Graham ambient space corresponds to the
momentum space of a massless scalar field. Hence on the one hand the null cone
parameterizes physical momentum excitations, while on the other hand, null rays
correspond to points in the underlying conformal manifold. This allows us to
identify a fundamental set of tractor operators with the generators of
conformal symmetries of a scalar field theory in a momentum representation.
Moreover, these constitute the minimal representation of the non-compact
conformal Lie symmetry algebra of the scalar field with Kostant--Kirillov
dimension d+1. Relaxing the conformally flat requirement, we find that while
the conformal Lie algebra of tractor operators is deformed by curvature
corrections, higher relations in the enveloping algebra corresponding to the
minimal representation persist. We also discuss potential applications of these
results to physics and conformal geometry.

possible low energy models which emerge in four dimensions by the dimensional
reduction of a gauge theory over multiple connected coset spaces. The higher
dimensional gauge theory is chosen to be the one that the Heterotic string
theory suggests: (i) it is defined in ten dimensions, (ii) it is based on the
E(8) x E(8) symmetry group and (iii) it is N=1 globally supersymmetric. The
search of all four-dimensional gauge theories resulting from the aforementioned
dimensional reduction, is restricted only to models which are potentially
interesting from a phenomenological point of view. This requirement constrain
these models to come from one of the known Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) in an
intermediate stage of the spontaneous symmetry breaking. Main result of my
study is that extensions of the Standard Model (SM) which are based on the
Pati-Salam group structure can be obtained in four dimensions. I furthermore
review some interesting noncommutative generalizations of the above ideas and
verify an important conclusion of a previous research work, namely that the
particle physics models resulting from this particular dimensional reduction
are renormalizable. Finally, assuming noncommutative characteristics for the
four-dimensional Minkowski space, M^{4}, I examine a particular approach of
noncommutative gravity. It turns out that the Ricci curvature tensor receives
non-trivial contributions due to the noncommutative structure of the algebra
describing the space, This conclusion suggests a possible fundamental
connection between the noncommutative geometry and the theory of gravity.

stagnation point boundary layer flow near a cold wall is considered in the
presence of solid particles much larger than the mean free path of vapour
particles. The supersaturated vapour condenses on the particles by diffusion
and particles and droplets are thermophoretically attracted to the wall.
Assuming that the heat of vaporization is much larger than the Boltzmann
constant times the temperature far from the wall, vapour condensation occurs in
a {\em condensation layer} (CL). The CL width and characteristics depend on the
parameters of the problem, and a parameter $R$ yielding the rate of vapour
scavenging by solid particles is particularly important. Assuming that the CL
is so narrow that temperature, particle density and velocity do not change
appreciably inside it, an asymptotic theory is found, the $\delta$-CL theory,
that approximates very well the vapour and droplet profiles, the dew point
shift and the deposition rates at the wall for wide ranges of the wall
temperature $\tilde{T}_{w}$ and the scavenging parameter $R$. This theory
breaks down for $\tilde{T}_{w}$ very close to the maximum temperature yielding
non-zero droplet deposition rate, $\tilde{T}_{w,M}$. For large $R$, we can
either assume that the width of the CL is zero (0-CL theory, then the vapour
density reaches local equilibrium with the condensate immediately after it
enters the dew surface), or use a nonlinear multiple scales theory. The 0-CL
theory corrects the $\delta$-CL theory for $\tilde{T}_w$ very close to
$\tilde{T}_{w,M}$ and any $R$, whereas the multiple scales theory is
appropriate for large and moderate $R$.

using the Bell-Rawlinson-Sawyer timescale test, that the model lent support to
the Boltzmann property assumption. We developed kinetic equations for the FMO

to Friedland et al., that in fact the Boltzmann property assumption does
breakdown in the FMO model. We have shown that the Bell-Rawlinson-Sawyer

bands can be explained by a central engine active for at least 250 s, while at
late times the X-ray light curve displays a simple power-law decay. In
contrast, the observed behaviour in the optical band is complex (from 10$^2$ up
to 10$^6$ s). We investigate the light curve behaviour in the context of the
standard forward/reverse shock model; associating the peak in the optical light
curve at $\sim$450 s with the fireball deceleration time results in a Lorenz
factor $\Gamma \approx 350$ at this time. In contrast, the shallow optical
decay between 450 and 1500 s remains problematic, requiring a reverse shock
component whose typical frequency is above the optical band at the optical peak
time for it to be explained within the standard model. This predicts an
increasing flux density for the forward shock component until t $\sim$ 4
$\times$ 10$^6$ s, inconsistent with the observed decay of the optical emission
from t $\sim$ 10$^4$ s. A highly magnetized fireball is also ruled out due to
unrealistic microphysic parameters and predicted light curve behaviour that is
not observed. We conclude that a long-lived central engine with a finely tuned
energy injection rate and a sudden cessation of the injection is required to
create the observed light curves - consistent with the same conditions that are
invoked to explain the plateau phase of canonical X-ray light curves of GRBs.

the south-east corners of these monuments align towards the site of the temple

discovered that a similar situation occurs in the main pyramid field of the
subsequent dynasty at Abu Sir. Here, the northwest corners of three
chronologically successive pyramids again voluntarily align towards Heliopolis.
However, the temple was in this case not visible, due to the rock outcrop today
occupied by the Cairo citadel which blocks the view. In the present paper, a

peculiar features, which governed from the very beginning the planning of these

micromagnetic simulations and ananlysed in terms of the leading dipolar
interaction energy between magnetic dipoles. We focus mainly on the case where
the particles present a vortex structure. In a first step the local magnetic
structure in the isolated particle is revisited. For particles bearing a
uniaxial magnetocrystaline anisotropy, it is shown that the vortex core
orientation relative to the easy axis depends on both the particle size and the
anisotropy constant. When the particles magnetization present a vortex
structure, it is shown that the polarization of the particles by the dipolar
field of the other one must be taken into account in the interaction. An
analytic form is deduced for the interaction which involves the vortex core
magnetization and the magnetic susceptibility which are obtained from the
magnetic properties of the isolated particle.

Dobru{\v{s}}in states that for strongly-irreducible subshifts, shift-invariant
Gibbs-measures are equilibrium measures. Here we prove a generalization of the
Lanford-Ruelle theorem: for all subshifts, any equilibrium measure for a
function with $d$-summable variation is ""topologically Gibbs"". This is a
relaxed notion which coincides with the usual notion of a Gibbs measure for
SFTs. In the second part of the paper, we study Gibbs and equilibrium measures
for some interesting families of subshifts: $\beta$-shifts, Dyck-shifts and
Kalikow-type shifts (defined below). In all of these cases, a Lanford-Ruelle
type theorem holds. For each of these families we provide a specific proof of

characterize those functions $\gamma$ that can appear as the standard of an
$n$-dimensional version. In this paper, we prove the conjecture of Lisitsky
that every standard must be the norm of a space that embeds in $L_0.$ This
result is almost optimal, as the norm of any finite dimensional subspace of
$L_p$ with $p\in (0,2]$ is the standard of an $n$-dimensional version
($p$-stable random vector) by the classical result of P.L\`evy. An equivalent
formulation is that if a function of the form $f(\|\cdot\|_K)$ is positive
definite on $R^n,$ where $K$ is an origin symmetric star body in $R^n$ and
$f:R\to R$ is an even continuous function, then either the space
$(R^n,\|\cdot\|_K)$ embeds in $L_0$ or $f$ is a constant function. Combined
with known facts about embedding in $L_0,$ this result leads to several
