functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Most fMRI analyses via GLM
proceed in a massively univariate fashion where the same design matrix is used
for analyzing data from each voxel. A major limitation of this approach is the
locally varying nature of signals of interest as well as associated confounds.
This local variability results in a potentially large bias and uncontrolled
increase in variance for the contrast of interest. The main contributions of
this paper are two fold (1) We develop a statistical framework called SMART
that enables estimation of an optimal design matrix while explicitly
controlling the bias variance decomposition over a set of potential design
matrices and (2) We develop and validate a numerical algorithm for computing
optimal design matrices for general fMRI data sets. The implications of this
framework include the ability to match optimally the magnitude of underlying
signals to their true magnitudes while also matching the ""null"" signals to zero
size thereby optimizing both the sensitivity and specificity of signal
detection. By enabling the capture of multiple profiles of interest using a
single contrast (as opposed to an F-test) in a way that optimizes for both bias
and variance enables the passing of first level parameter estimates and their
variances to the higher level for group analysis which is not possible using
F-tests. We demonstrate the application of this approach to in vivo
pharmacological fMRI data capturing the acute response to a drug infusion, to
task-evoked, block design fMRI and to the estimation of a haemodynamic response
function (HRF) response in event-related fMRI. Our framework is quite general
and has potentially wide applicability to a variety of disciplines.

arises due to quantum effects of the massless matter fields. A modified version
of the Starobinsky (MSt) model takes the masses of matter fields and the
cosmological constant, $\Lambda$, into account. The equations of motion become
much more complicated however approximate analytic and numeric solutions are
possible. In the MSt model, inflation starts due to the supersymmetric (SUSY)
particle content of the underlying theory and the transition to the radiation
dominated epoch occurs due to the relatively heavy s-particles decoupling. For
$\Lambda=0$ the inflationary solution is stable until the last stage, just
before decoupling. In the present paper we generalize this result for
$\Lambda\neq 0$, since $\Lambda$ should be non-vanishing at the SUSY scale. We
also take into account the radiative corrections to $\Lambda$. The main result
is that the inflationary solution of the MSt model remains robust and stable.

implications for interpreting bar and spiral fractions at high redshift.
Analysis of previous samples suggested that such a correlation exists in the

important. However, the earlier samples had only a few excessively strong bars.
Our new sample largely confirms our previous studies, but still any correlation
is relatively weak. We find two galaxies, NGC 7513 and UGC 10862, where there

""exponential method"", ""Jacobi expansion method"", ""new ..."", etc. The common
default to all these ""truncation methods"" is to only provide some solutions,
not all of them. By implementing three classical results of Briot, Bouquet and
Poincare', we present an algorithm able to provide in closed form \textit{all}
those travellingz waves which are elliptic or degenerate elliptic, i.e.
rational in one exponential or rational. Our examples here include the

final state containing the result of the computation. Simultaneously meeting
the conflicting requirements of long coherence, state preparation, universal
gate operations, and qubit readout makes building quantum processors
challenging. Few-qubit processors have already been shown in nuclear magnetic

Henryk Wozniakowski at Friedrich Schiller University in Jena, Germany on June

computational complexity of continuous problems. Examples of such problems
include partial differential equations (in particular, the Schrodinger
equation) very high dimensional integration, approximation, continuous
optimization, and path integration. Because the computer has only partial
information about the continuous mathematical problem adversary arguments at
the information level often lead to tight complexity bounds. This may be
contrasted with discrete problems where only conjectures that the complexity
hierarchy does not collapse are available. This paper discusses precursors to
IBC. It reports on the beginning of optimal iteration theory in the early 60s
which was published in Traub's 1964 monograph. In the 70s Traub and
Wozniakowski began to formulate the foundations of IBC leading to their 1980

origin in the different accretion regimes of the two classes of objects. Using
the gamma-ray luminosity as a proxy for the observed bolometric one we show
that the boundary between the two subclasses of blazars can be associated with
the threshold between the regimes of optically thick accretion disks and of
radiatively inefficient accretion flows, which lies at an accretion rate of the
order of 0.01 the Eddington rate. The spectral separation in hard (BL Lacs) and
soft (FSRQs) objects can then result from the different radiative cooling
suffered by the relativistic electrons in jets propagating in different
ambients. We argue that the bulk of the most luminous blazars alread detected
by Fermi should be characterised by large black hole masses, around 10^9 solar
masses, and predict that lowering the gamma-ray flux threshold the region of
the alpha_gamma-L_gamma plane corresponding to steep spectral indices and lower

are much more compact than present-day galaxies of the same mass. Here we
compare the radial stellar density profiles and the number density of a sample
of massive galaxies at z ~ 2.3 to nearby massive elliptical galaxies. We
confirm that the average stellar densities of the z ~ 2.3 galaxies within the
effective radius, rho(<r_e), are two orders of magnitude higher than those of
local elliptical galaxies of the same stellar mass. However, we also find that
the densities measured within a constant physical radius of 1 kpc, rho(<1 kpc),
are higher by a factor of 2-3 only. This suggests that inside-out growth
scenarios are plausible, in which the compact high redshift galaxies make up
the centers of normal nearby ellipticals. The compact galaxies are common at
high redshift, which enables us to further constrain their evolution by
requiring that the number density of their descendants does not exceed
constraints imposed by the z=0 galaxy mass function. We infer that size growth
must be efficient, with (r_{1+2}/r_1) ~ (M_{1+2}/M_1)^2. A simple model where
compact galaxies with masses ~ 10^11 Msun primarily grow through minor mergers
produces descendants with the approximate sizes, stellar densities, and number
density of elliptical galaxies with masses 2-3 x10^11 Msun in the local
Universe. We note that this model also predicts evolution in the M_BH - sigma
relation, such that the progenitors of elliptical galaxies have lower black
hole masses at fixed velocity dispersion. The main observational uncertainty is
the conversion from light to mass; measurements of kinematics are needed to
calibrate the masses and stellar densities of the high redshift galaxies.

escape fraction at z=10.4 is close to 80% declining monotonically with time as
more massive objects build up at lower redshifts. Although the amount of dust
absorption is uncertain to 1-1.5 dex, it is tightly correlated with
metallicity; we find that dust is unlikely to significantly impact the observed
UV output. These results support reionization by stellar radiation from
low-luminosity dwarf galaxies and are also compatible with Lyman continuum
observations and theoretical predictions at z\sim3-4.

higher luminosity and higher initial metallicity. It is absent for luminosities

Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for three metallicities, and compare this with the
occurrence of observational phenomena in O stars: microturbulence, non-radial
pulsations, wind clumping, and line profile variability. The confirmation of
all three trends for the FeCZ as function of stellar parameters by empirical
microturbulent velocities argues for a physical connection between
sub-photospheric convective motions and small scale stochastic velocities in
the photosphere of O- and B-type stars. We further suggest that clumping in the
inner parts of the winds of OB stars could be caused by the same mechanism, and
that magnetic fields produced in the FeCZ could appear at the surface of OB

estimation uncertainty in such a physical setup scales better than the
conventional Heisenberg uncertainty limit over a specified but arbitrary range

filtering theory, we demonstrate numerically an explicit parameter estimator
(called a quantum particle filter) whose observed scaling follows that of our
calculated quantum Fisher information. Moreover, the quantum particle filter
quantitatively surpasses the uncertainty limit calculated from the quantum
Cramer-Rao inequality based on a magnetic coupling Hamiltonian with only
single-body operators. We also show that a quantum Kalman filter is
insufficient to obtain super-Heisenberg scaling, and present evidence that such

magnetic reconnection in the presence of weak turbulence proposed by Lazarian &
Vishniac (1999). This model predicts that weak turbulence, generically present
in most of astrophysical systems, enhances the rate of reconnection by reducing
the transverse scale for reconnection events and by allowing many independent
flux reconnection events to occur simultaneously. As a result the reconnection
speed becomes independent of Ohmic resistivity and is determined by the
magnetic field wandering induced by turbulence. To quantify the reconnection
speed we use both an intuitive definition, i.e. the speed of the reconnected
flux inflow, as well as a more sophisticated definition based on a formally
derived analytical expression. Our results confirm the predictions of the
Lazarian & Vishniac model. In particular, we find that Vrec Pinj^(1/2), as
predicted by the model. The dependence on the injection scale for some of our
models is a bit weaker than expected, i.e. l^(3/4), compared to the predicted
linear dependence on the injection scale, which may require some refinement of
the model or may be due to the effects like finite size of the excitation
region. The reconnection speed was found to depend on the expected rate of
magnetic field wandering and not on the magnitude of the guide field. In our
models, we see no dependence on the guide field when its strength is comparable
to the reconnected component. More importantly, while in the absence of
turbulence we successfully reproduce the Sweet-Parker scaling of reconnection,
in the presence of turbulence we do not observe any dependence on Ohmic
resistivity, confirming that our reconnection is fast.

to organize correlation functions is the defect operator expansion (dOPE). We
analyze how the dOPE is implemented in theories with a holographic dual,
highlighting some interesting aspects of the operator/state mapping in
non-relativistic holography.

found at the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) MSH 15-52 and its associated pulsar PSR
B1509-58. The discovery was made with the High Energy Stereoscopic System
(H.E.S.S.), which currently provides the most sensitive measurement in the
energy range of about 0.2-100 TeV. This analysis is the first to include all
H.E.S.S. data from observations dedicated to MSH 15-52. The corresponding flux
above 1 TeV is (4.4+/-0.2stat+/-1.0syst) x 10^{-12}cm^{-2}s^{-1}. The energy
spectrum obeys a power-law with a differential flux at 1 TeV of
(5.8+/-0.2stat+/-1.3syst) x 10^{-12}cm^{-2}s^{-1}TeV^{-1} and a photon index of
2.32+/-0.04stat+/-0.10syst. The gamma-ray emission extends along the pulsar
jet, previously resolved in X-rays. This becomes more apparent after image
deconvolution. The emission region along the jet axis decreases with increasing
energy. An upper limit for the pulsed gamma-ray flux from PSR B1509-58 was
calculated. Additional discussions include: the system of MSH 15-52 and PSR
B1509-58, theory and methods of VHE gamma-ray astronomy and H.E.S.S., the first
(Richardson-Lucy) deconvolution of VHE gamma-ray maps, search for pulsed
emission from pulsars. The results are discussed within the framework of PWNs
and are explained by inverse Compton scattering of leptons. A hadronic
component is not excluded, but its gamma-ray emission would not be significant.
Moreover, it is concluded that advection is the dominant transport mechanism
over diffusion in the magnetized flow of the pulsar wind from PSR B1509-58. A
correlation analysis with the Chandra X-ray data suggests that gamma radiation
is emitted from the region of PSR B1509-58, but not from the neighboring
optical nebula RCW 89.

detectors such as LISA will not be able to detect all such mergers nor assign
precise black hole parameters to the merger, due to weak gravitational wave
signal strengths. In order to use LISA observations to infer the statistics of
the underlying population, these errors must be taken into account. We describe
here a method for folding the LISA gravitational wave parameter error estimates
into an `error kernel' designed for use at the population model level. The

lectures on his theory of relativity. The motion was proposed by Jorge Duclout
(1856-1927), who had been educated at the Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule,
Zurich (ETH). This proposal was the culmination of a series of initiatives of
various Argentine intellectuals interested in the theory of relativity. In a
very short time Dr. Mauricio Nirenstein (1877-1935), then the university's
administrative secretary, fulfilled all the requirements for the university's
invitation to be endorsed and delivered to the sage in Berlin. The visit took
place three years later, in March-April 1925.
  The Argentine press received Einstein with great interest and respect; his
early exchanges covered a wide range of topics, including international
politics and Jewish matters. Naturally, the journalists were more eager to hear
from the eminent pacifist than from the incomprehensible physicist. However,
after his initial openness with the press, the situation changed and Einstein
restricted his public discourse to topics on theoretical physics, avoiding some
controversial political, religious, or philosophical matters that he had freely
touched upon in earlier interviews.. [abridged].

trans-Planckian problem for cosmological perturbations and of back-reaction
effects . Firstly, without understanding both Planck-scale physics and the

consists in fitting the data using a generalised least-squares method, where
the function to be minimized is defined to handle asymmetrically the data at
both sides of the boundary. In order to minimise the cost function, a numerical
approach, based on the popular downhill simplex method, is employed. The
procedure is valid for any numerically computable function. Simple polynomials
provide good boundaries in common situations. For data exhibiting a complex
behaviour, the use of adaptive splines gives excellent results. Since the
described method is sensitive to extreme data points, the simultaneous
introduction of error weighting and the flexibility of allowing some points to
fall outside of the fitted frontier, supplies the parameters that help to tune
the boundary fitting depending on the nature of the considered problem. Two
simple examples are presented, namely the estimation of spectra
pseudo-continuum and the segregation of scattered data into ranges. The
normalisation of the data ranges prior to the fitting computation typically
reduces both the numerical errors and the number of iterations required during

diffuses from a random node and reach nodes shell after shell. Thus,
understanding the shell structure is crucial for the study of the transport
property of networks. For a randomly connected network with given degree
distribution, we derive analytically the degree distribution and average degree
of the nodes residing outside shell $\ell$ as a function of $r_\ell$. Further,
we find that $r_\ell$ follows an iterative functional form
$r_\ell=\phi(r_{\ell-1})$, where $\phi$ is expressed in terms of the generating
function of the original degree distribution of the network. Our results can
explain the power-law distribution of the number of nodes $B_\ell$ found in
shells with $\ell$ larger than the network diameter $d$, which is the average
distance between all pairs of nodes. For real world networks the theoretical
prediction of $r_\ell$ deviates from the empirical $r_\ell$. We introduce a
network correlation function $c(r_\ell)\equiv r_{\ell+1}/\phi(r_\ell)$ to
characterize the correlations in the network, where $r_{\ell+1}$ is the
empirical value and $\phi(r_\ell)$ is the theoretical prediction. $c(r_\ell)=1$
indicates perfect agreement between empirical results and theory. We apply
$c(r_\ell)$ to several model and real world networks. We find that the networks
fall into two distinct classes: (i) a class of {\it poorly-connected} networks

variance with the analogous sdB field stars. Another puzzling result concerns
the derived spectroscopic masses for some EHB stars. The present paper extends
our study of NGC6752 to M80 and NGC5986. Twenty-one horizontal branch stars
(out of which 5 EHBs) in NGC5986 and 31 in M80 (11 EHBs) were observed during
four consecutive nights. We measured radial velocity variations, temperatures,
gravities, and helium abundances. By means of a statistical analysis, we
detected one EHB close binary candidate per cluster. In M80, the best estimate
of the close binary EHB fraction is f=12%, and even the lowest estimate of the
binary fraction among field sdB stars can be ruled out within a 90% confidence
level. Because of the small observed sample, no strong conclusions can be drawn
on the close EHB binary fraction for NGC5986, although our best estimate is
rather low (f=25%). For the discrepancy in spectroscopic derived masses with
theoretical models observed in NGC6752, our analysis of M80 EHB stars shows a
similar trend. For the first time, we report a clear trend in surface helium
abundance with temperature. Our results show that the deficiency of close
binaries among EHB stars is now confirmed in two, and possibly three, globular
clusters. This feature is therefore not a peculiarity of NGC6752. Our analysis
also proves that the strangely high spectroscopic masses among EHB stars are
now confirmed in at least a second cluster. Our results confirm that f could be
a function of the age of the sdB star population, but we find that recent
models have some problem reproducing all observations.

Assuming one single emission mechanism dominates in the whole energy range, we
show that this spectrum is consistent with synchrotron origin by
shock-accelerated electrons. The simple electron inverse-Compton model and the
hadronic model are found to be less viable. In the synchrotron scenario, the
synchrotron self-Compton scattering is likely to be in the Klein-Nishina regime
and therefore the resulting high-energy emission is subdominant, even though
the magnetic field energy density is lower than that in relativistic electrons.
The Klein-Nishina inverse-Compton cooling may also affect the low-energy
electron number distribution and hence results in a low-energy synchrotron
photon spectrum $n(\nu)\propto\nu^{-1}$ below the peak energy. Under the
framework of the electron synchrotron interpretation, we constrain the shock
microphysical parameters and derive a lower limit of the upstream magnetic

star is highly polarized. However, the observed polarization may be modified
due to photon propagation through the star's magnetosphere. For photon
frequencies much larger than the typical radio frequency, vacuum birefringence
due to strong-field quantum electrodynamics dominates over the plasma effect.
We study the evolution of photon polarization in the magnetized QED vacuum of a
neutron star magnetosphere, paying particular attention to the propagation
effect across the quasi-tangential (QT) point, where the photon momentum is
nearly aligned with the magnetic field. In agreement with previous studies, we
find that in most regions of the magnetosphere, the photon polarization modes
are decoupled due to vacuum birefringence, and therefore a large net linear
polarization can be expected when the radiation escapes the magnetosphere.
However, we show that X-ray polarization may change significantly when the
photon passes through the QT region. When averaging over a finite emission
area, the net effect of QT propagation is to reduce the degree of linear
polarization; the reduction factor depends on the photon energy, magnetic field
strength, geometry, rotation phase and the emission area, and can be more than
a factor of two. We derive the general conditions under which the QT
propagation effect is important, and provide an easy-to-use prescription to
account for the QT effect for most practical calculations of X-ray polarization
signals from magnetic neutron stars. For a neutron star with a dipole magnetic
field, the QT effect can be important for emission from the polar cap for
certain magnetic field and energy ranges, and is negligible for emission from
the entire stellar surface.

the organization of nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom into a single

because of the separation between nuclear/electronic and atomic/molecular time
scales. Where separation of time scales occurs, identification of analogous

candidates for this structural phase, based on {\it single}--cationic type and

38 GPa, Rh$_{2}$O$_{3}$(II) type structure becomes more stable with respect to

out by our calculations in this pressure regime. The Rh$_{2}$O$_{3}$(II) type

increasing the pressure at about 330 GPa, the system evolves to yet another new

builds on BB84. In EEQKD, the qubits sent individually in BB84 are entangled

provided only one-by-one access to the transmission. The maximal information an
eavesdropper can gain using a straightforward intercept-resend (IR) attack, is
obtained for a given error rate. The secure key generation rate of EEQKD is
estimated in practical scenarios including qubit loss and quantum channel

an IR attack, EEQKD reduces to BB84.

series of radiation driven implosion (RDI) processes proceeded in the past from
near the central O star(s) towards the peripheries of the HII region. We found
that in general weak-line T-Tauri stars (WTTSs) are somewhat older than
classical T-Tauri stars (CTTSs). Also the fraction of CTTSs among the T-Tauri

filters, to apply it to the central parsec of the GC, and to conduct a
population analysis of this area. We use AO assisted observations obtained at
the ESO VLT in the NIR H-band and 7 intermediate bands covering the NIR K-band.
A comparison of the resulting SEDs with a blackbody of variable extinction then
allows us to determine the presence and strength of a CO absorption feature to
distinguish between early and late type stars. The new method is suitable to
classify K giants (and later) as well as B2 main sequence (and earlier) stars
which are brighter than 15.5 mag in the K band in the central parsec. Compared
to previous spectroscopic investigations that are limited to 13-14 mag, this
represents a major improvement in the depth of the observations as well as
reducing the needed observation time. We classify 312 stars as early type
candidates out of a sample of 5914 sources. The distribution of the early type
stars can be fitted with a steep power law (beta(R>1'') = -1.49 +/- 0.12,
alternatively with a broken power law, beta(R=1-10'') = -1.08 +/- 0.12,
beta(R=10-20'') = -3.46 +/- 0.58, since we find a drop of the early type
density at ~10''). We also detect early type candidates outside of 0.5 pc in
significant numbers for the first time. The late type density function shows an
inversion in the inner 6'', with a power law slope of beta(R<6'') = 0.17 +/-
0.09. The late type KLF has a power law slope of 0.30$\pm$0.01, closely
resembling the KLF obtained for the bulge of the Milky Way. The early type KLF
has a much flatter slope of 0.14 +/- 0.02. Our results agree best with an

continuum consists of two components; a power-law component dominating optical
wavelengths which is the direct light from the central source and thermal
emission dominating near-infrared wavelengths which is attributed to the
emission from hot dust in the circumnuclear region. The thermal emission well
represents optically thick emission by hot dust at T ~ 1300K with tau(2micron)>
2 and apparent mass, M(hot) >10 M_sun. Thus, our observations directly detected
the optically thick region of hot dust in APM 08279+5255. HI recombination
lines of H_alpha(0.656micron), Pa_alpha(1.875micron), and Pa_beta(1.282micron)
are clearly detected at 3.2, 6.3, and 9.3 micron. Simulations with the

clouds characterized by log n_{H} ~ 12- 14 for the gas density, log U ~ -2 -
-6$ for the ionization parameter, and E(B-V) ~ 0.3-0.6$for the broad line
region. Thus, optically thick emission of hot dust support an idea on
non-spherical distribution of dust near the central source, consistent with the
Active Galactic Nuclei model with the dust torus. The temperature of hot dust
and flux ratios of these HI lines are similar to those observed in low-redshift
quasars. There are significant time-variations in the HI lines, which are
probably caused by variations in the brightness of the central source.

relations and the period matrix for $X$ are defined and some consequences
drawn. The space of holomorphic 1-forms on $X$ has dimension $g$ as a complex
vector space. Fundamental results on divisors on compact Riemann surfaces are
stated and proved. The Riemann-Roch theorem is of utmost importance in the
algebraic geometric theory of compact Riemann surfaces. It tells us how many
linearly independent meromorphic functions there are having certain
restrictions on their poles. We present a simple direct proof of this theorem
and explore some of its numerous consequences. We also give an analytic proof
of the Riemann-Hurwitz formula. As an application, we compute the genus of some
interesting algebraic curves. Abel's theorem classifies divisors by their
images in the jacobian. The Jacobi inversion problem askes whether we can find

basis is known to be quite predictive. We integrate this very specific neutrino
symmetry into a more general framework based on the supersymmetric SO(10) grand
unified theory. As in several other models, the fermion mass spectrum is
determined by Hermitian mass matrices resulting from the renormalizable Yukawa
couplings of the 16-plet of fermions with the Higgs fields transforming as $10,
\bar{126},120$ representations of the SO(10) group. The $\mu$-$\tau$ symmetry
is spontaneously broken through the 120-plet. Consequences of this scheme are
considered for fermion masses using both type-I and type-II seesaw mechanism.
This scenario is shown to lead to a generalized CP invariance of the mass
matrices and vanishing CP violating phases if the Yukawa couplings are
invariant under the $\mu$-$\tau$ symmetry. Small explicit breaking of the
$\mu$-$\tau$ symmetry is then shown to provide a very good understanding of all
the fermion masses and mixing. Detailed fits to the fermion spectrum are
presented in several scenarios. One obtains a very good fit to all observables
in the context of the type-I seesaw mechanism but type-II seesaw model also
provides a good description except for the overall scale of the neutrino
masses. Three major predictions on the leptonic mixing parameters in the type-I
seesaw case are (1) the atmospheric mixing angle $\theta_{23}^{l}$ close to
maximal, (2) $\theta_{13}^{l}$ close to the present upper bound and (3)
negative but very small Dirac CP violating phase in the neutrino oscillations.

unexpected plateau on decreasing the DC magnetic field below a certain value.
In particular, at temperatures near T_c the hysteresis manifests itself only
through the presence of the plateau. Although we do not quantitatively justify
the anomalous shape of the magnetic hysteresis, we show that the results
obtained in the reversible region of the R_s(H) curve can be quite well
accounted for by supposing that, in this range of magnetic field, the pi-gap is
almost suppressed by the applied field and, consequently, all the pi-band
charge carriers are quasiparticles. On this hypothesis, we have calculated
R_s(H) supposing that fluxons assume a conventional (single core) structure and
the flux dynamics can be described in the framework of conventional models.
  From the fitting of the experimental results, we determine the values of
H_{c2}^pi(T) at temperatures near T_c. In our opinion, the most important
result of our investigation is that, at least at temperatures near T_c, the
value of the applied field that separates the reversible and irreversible
regions of the R_s(H) curves is just H_{c2}^pi(T); a qualitative discussion of

been investigated in Au + Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV using a
multi-phase transport model (AMPT). Such reaction plane azimuthal angle
dependent correlations can shed light on path-length effect of energy loss of
high transverse momentum particles propagating through the hot dense medium.
The correlations vary with the trigger particle azimuthal angle with respect to
the reaction plane direction, $\phi_{s}=\phi_{T}-\Psi_{EP}$, which is
consistent with the experimental observation by the STAR collaboration. The
dihadron azimuthal angle correlation functions on the away side of the trigger
particle present a distinct evolution from a single peak to a broad, possibly
double peak, structure when the trigger particle direction goes from in-plane
to out-of-plane of the reaction plane. The away-side angular correlation
functions are asymmetric with respect to the back-to-back direction in some
regions of $\phi_{s}$, which could provide insight on testing $v_{1}$ method to
reconstruct the reaction plane. In addition, both the root-mean-square width
($W_{rms}$) of the away-side correlation distribution and the splitting
parameter $D$ between the away-side double peaks increase slightly with
$\phi_{s}$, and the average transverse momentum of the away-side associated
hadrons shows a strong $\phi_{s}$ dependence. Our results indicate that strong
parton cascade and resultant energy loss could play an important role for the
appearance of a double-peak structure in the dihadron azimuthal angular

In this paper, we present solutions to address these problems on the level of
the underlying Prolog system. Improved unification modes meet the requirements
of norm based analysers by offering dynamic occurs-check detection. A
generalized finite domain solver overcomes the shortcomings of conventional

general form of the interaction between the oscillators, we consider two
different situations: i) when each oscillator is coupled to its own reservoir,
and ii) when both oscillators are coupled to a common reservoir. After deriving

process of particular entanglements in the positional space of both
oscillators. To analyze the decoherence mechanism we have derived a general
decay function for the off-diagonal peaks of the density matrix, which applies
both to a common and separate reservoirs. We have also identified the expected
interaction between the two dissipative oscillators induced by their common
reservoir. Such reservoir-induced interaction, which gives rise to interesting
collective damping effects, such as the emergence of relaxation- and
decoherence-free subspaces, is shown to be blurred by the high-temperature
regime considered in this study. However, we find that different interactions
between the dissipative oscillators, described by rotating or counter-rotating
terms, result in different decay rates for the interference terms of the

improving their bounds. Finally, another consequence of our results is that

there is a clear separation of time scales of center of mass and relative
coordinates. The latter relax very fast to zero and the array behaves as a
single entity described by the center of mass coordinate. We compute
analytically the stationary probability and the moments of the center of mass
coordinate. The scaling behaviour of the moments near the critical value of the
control parameter $a_c(N)$ is determined. We identify a crossover from linear
to square root scaling with increasing distance from $a_c$. The crossover point
approaches $a_c$ in the limit $N \to \infty$ which reproduces previous results
for infinite arrays. The results are obtained in both the Fokker-Planck and the
Langevin approach and are corroborated by numerical simulations. For a general
class of models we show that the transition manifold in the parameter space

surface of a topological insulator, respectively, at a magnetic domain wall and
at a magnet-superconductor interface. Interferometry of Majorana fermions is a
key operation in topological quantum computation, but the detection is
problematic since these particles have no charge. The Dirac-Majorana converter
enables electrical detection of the interferometric signal.

  by a co-editor of the Workshop proceedings",,,"WLPE/2008/06","cs.PL cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent work, we have proposed an approach to Test Data Generation (TDG) of
imperative bytecode by partial evaluation (PE) of CLP which consists in two
phases: (1) the bytecode program is first transformed into an equivalent CLP
program by means of interpretive compilation by PE, (2) a second PE is
performed in order to supervise the generation of test-cases by execution of
the CLP decompiled program. The main advantages of TDG by PE include
flexibility to handle new coverage criteria, the possibility to obtain
test-case generators and its simplicity to be implemented. The approach in
principle can be directly applied for TDG of any imperative language. However,
when one tries to apply it to a declarative language like Prolog, we have found
as a main difficulty the generation of test-cases which cover the more complex
control flow of Prolog. Essentially, the problem is that an intrinsic feature
of PE is that it only computes non-failing derivations while in TDG for Prolog
it is essential to generate test-cases associated to failing computations.
Basically, we propose to transform the original Prolog program into an
equivalent Prolog program with explicit failure by partially evaluating a
Prolog interpreter which captures failing derivations w.r.t. the input program.
Another issue that we discuss in the paper is that, while in the case of
bytecode the underlying constraint domain only manipulates integers, in Prolog
it should properly handle the symbolic data manipulated by the program. The
resulting scheme is of interest for bringing the advantages which are inherent
in TDG by PE to the field of logic programming.

and XBootes Survey to measure the X-ray evolution of 6146 normal galaxies as a
function of absolute optical luminosity, redshift, and spectral type over the
largely unexplored redshift range 0.1 < z < 0.5. Because only the closest or
brightest of the galaxies are individually detected in X-rays, we use a
stacking analysis to determine the mean properties of the sample. Our results
suggest that X-ray emission from spectroscopically late-type galaxies is
dominated by star formation, while that from early-type galaxies is dominated
by a combination of hot gas and AGN emission. We find that the mean star
formation and supermassive black hole accretion rate densities evolve like
(1+z)^3, in agreement with the trends found for samples of bright, individually
detectable starburst galaxies and AGN. Our work also corroborates the results
of many previous stacking analyses of faint source populations, with improved
statistics.

functioning of embedded software systems which control the functioning of more

Hence, computations performed need not only to be correct, but must also be
issued in a timely fashion. Worst case execution time (WCET) analysis is
concerned with computing tight upper bounds for the execution time of a system
in order to provide formal guarantees for the proper timing behaviour of a
system. Central for this is to compute safe and tight bounds for loops and
recursion depths. In this paper, we highlight the TuBound approach to this
challenge at whose heart is a constraint logic based approach for loop
analysis.
