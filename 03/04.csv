matched expansions, to compute the self-force acting on a point particle moving
in a curved spacetime. The method uses two expansions for the Green function,
valid in `quasilocal' and `distant past' regimes, which are matched within the
normal neighbourhood. We perform our calculation in a static region of the
spherically symmetric Nariai spacetime (dS_2 x S^2), on which scalar
perturbations are governed by a radial equation with a P\""oschl-Teller
potential. We combine (i) a very high order quasilocal expansion, and (ii) an
expansion in quasinormal modes, to determine the Green function globally. We
show it is singular everywhere on the null wavefront (even outside the normal
neighbourhood), and apply asymptotic methods to determine its singular
structure. We find the Green function undergoes a transition every time the
null wavefront passes through a caustic: the singular part follows a repeating
four-fold sequence $\delta(\sigma)$, $1/\pi \sigma$, $-\delta(\sigma)$, $-1/\pi
\sigma$ etc., where $\sigma$ is Synge's world function.
  The matched expansion method provides new insight into the non-local
properties of the self-force; we find the contribution from the segment of the
worldline lying outside the normal neighbourhood is significant. We compute the
scalar self-force acting on a static particle, and validate against an
alternative method. Finally, we discuss wave propagation on black hole
spacetimes (where any expansion in quasinormal modes will be augmented by a
branch cut integral) and predict that the Green function in Schwarzschild
spacetime will inherit the four-fold singular structure found here.

cosmological perturbations in a Randall-Sundrum braneworld having an arbitrary
expansion history. We adopt a four-dimensional perspective in which the
localized degrees of freedom on the brane are regarded as an open quantum
system coupled to the large environment composed of the Anti-de Sitter ($AdS$)
bulk gravitons. Due to the non-uniform expansion of the universe, the brane
degrees of freedom and the bulk degrees of freedom interact as they propagate
forward in time, leading to an effective dissipation as well as a nonlocality
from the four-dimensional point of view of an observer on the brane. Using both
the ""bare"" retarded propagator on the brane and the retarded propagator in the
bulk, we compute the effective propagator on the brane for the ""dressed"" brane
modes by resumming the bulk backreaction effects at all order in the brane-bulk
coupling. Dissipation and nonlocality are encoded into the effective brane
propagator. We find the dissipation rates of various matter perturbations on
the brane as well as of the graviton bound state. Next we present an explicit
calculation of the covariant retarded Green function for the graviton in $AdS$
space. In the last part, we investigate the reconstruction of CMB lensing in
standard cosmology. We construct a statistical estimator of the gravitational
lensing dilatation and shear fields directly in real space. The real space
method developed here is useful for analysing realistic CMB maps containing a

The anisotropy $\rho_c/\rho_{ab}\approx 8$ depends only slightly on
temperature. In both orientations, the spin-density wave transition at $T_{\rm

Susceptibility measurements evidence the magnetic order of the Eu$^{2+}$
moments at $T_N=19$ K with little influence on the electronic transport taking
place in the FeAs layers. Polarization-dependent infrared spectroscopy reveals
strongly anisotropic optical properties and yields a carrier density of only
$4.2\times 10^{21} {\rm cm}^{-3}$ and a bandmass of $m_b=2m_0$. A sizeable
Drude contribution is present at all temperatures and narrows upon cooling.
Below $T_{\rm SDW}$, the spin-density-wave gap develops in the in-plane optical
conductivity; no appreciable change is detected for the perpendicular
polarization. Modifications in the phonon features are associated with changes
of the electronic properties at $T_{\rm SDW}$. The extended Drude analysis
yields a linear behavior of the frequency-dependent scattering rate below
$T_{\rm SDW}$, indicating an interaction between the charge carriers and spin
fluctuations in the spin-density-wave state.

Soft X-ray excesses have been detected in several Be/X-ray binaries and
interpreted as the signature of hard X-ray reprocessing in the inner accretion
disk. The system XMMU J054134.7-682550, located in the LMC, featured a giant
Type II outburst in August 2007. The geometry of this system can be understood
by studying the response of the soft excess emission to the hard X-ray pulses.
  Methods. We have analyzed series of simultaneous observations obtained with
XMM-Newton/EPIC-MOS and RXTE/PCA in order to derive spectral and temporal
characteristics of the system, before, during and after the giant outburst.
Spectral fits were performed and a timing analysis has been carried out.
Spectral variability, spin period evolution and energy dependent pulse shapes
are analysed.
  Results. The outburst (L_X = 3* 10^38 erg/s \approx L_EDD) spectrum could be
modeled successfully using a cutoff powerlaw, a cold disk emission, a hot
blackbody, and a cyclotron absorption line. The magnetic field and
magnetospheric radius could be constrained. The thickness of the inner
accretion disk is broadened to a width of 75 km. The hot blackbody component
features sinusoidal modulations indicating that the bulk of the hard X-ray
emission is emitted preferentially along the magnetic equator. The spin period
of the pulsar decreased very significantly during the outburst. This is
consistent with a variety of neutron star equations of state and indicates a
very high accretion rate.

occurring at the center of the channel and close to the top/bottom wall. The
extent of the inter-diffusive zone scales as square root of the axial distance
at the center of the channel. At the top/bottom wall, we find an exponent 1/3
at early stages of mixing as observed in the experiments of Ismagilov and
coworkers [Appl. Phys. Lett. 76, 2376 (2000)]. At a larger distance from the
entrance, the scaling exponent close to the walls changes to 1/2 [J.-B. Salmon

finite aspect ratio on diffusive broadening. Interestingly, we find the same
scaling laws regardless of the channel's aspect ratio. However,the point at
which the exponent 1/3 characterizing the broadening at the top/bottom wall
reverts to the normal diffusive behavior downstream strongly depends on the
aspect ratio. We propose an interpretation of this observation in terms of
shear rate at the side walls. A criterion for the range of aspect ratios with
non-negligible effect on diffusive broadening is also provided.

clusters in the solar neighborhood, discerning between bound clusters and
transient stellar condensations within our sample. Then, we discriminate
between Gould Belt (GB) and local Galactic disk (LGD) members, using a previous
estimate of the structural parameters of both systems obtained from a sample of
O-B6 Hipparcos stars. Using this classified sample we analyze the spatial
structure and the kinematic behavior of the cluster system in the GB. The two
star formation regions that dominate and give the GB its characteristic
inclined shape show a striking difference in their content of star clusters:
while Ori OB1 is richly populated by open clusters, not a single one can be
found within the boundaries of Sco OB2. This is mirrored in the velocity space,
translating again into an abundance of clusters in the region of the kinematic
space populated by the members of Ori OB1, and a marginal number of them
associated to Sco OB2. In the light of these results we study the nature of the
GB with respect to the optical segment of the Orion Arm, and we propose that
the different content of star clusters, the different heights over the Galactic
plane and the different residual velocities of Ori OB1 and Sco OB2 can be
explained in terms of their relative position to the density maximum of the
Local Arm in the solar neighborhood. Although morphologically intriguing, the
GB appears to be the result of our local and biased view of a larger star
cluster complex in the Local Arm, that could be explained by the internal
dynamics of the Galactic disk.

Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) survey. We compare their properties to the
sample in the Virgo cluster that we studied in a previous paper (di Serego
Alighieri et al. 2007, Paper I). We have selected a sample of 62 nearby ETGs
(V< 3000 km/s) in an area of the sky where the ALFALFA data are already
available (8h<RA<16h, 4 deg<DEC<16deg), avoiding the region of the Virgo
cluster. Among these, 39 have absolute B magnitudes fainter than M_B = -17.
Fifteen out of 62 galaxies have been firmly detected with ALFALFA (\sim 25%).
Five additional galaxies show a weaker HI emission (S/N \sim 4) and they will
need deeper observations to be confirmed. All together, our analysis doubles
the number of known gas-rich ETGs in this area. The HI detection rate is 44% in
luminous ETGs (M_B < -17) and 13% in dwarf ETGs (M_B > -17). In both cases it
is 10 times higher than that of the Virgo cluster. The presence of gas can be
related to a recent star formation activity: 60% of all ETGs with HI have
optical emission line ratios typical of star-forming galaxies and blue colours
suggesting the presence of young stellar populations, especially in the dwarf
subsample. We show that the HI detection rate of ETGs depends both on the
environment and mass. The fraction of early-type systems with neutral hydrogen
is higher in more massive objects when compared to early-type dwarfs. The ETGs
in LDEs seem to have more heterogeneous properties than their Virgo cluster
counterparts, since they are able to retain a cold interstellar gas component
and to support star formation activity even at recent epochs.

(LM-RSP) that is based on a pick-and-compare principle in a time-varying

study the performance of LM-RSP in terms of its stability region and average

capacity region. Our analysis characterizes this fraction as well as the
average delay as a function of channel variations and the efficiency of LM-RSP
in choosing an appropriate schedule vector. Applying these results to a class
of Markovian channels, we provide explicit results on the stability region and

fundamental cosmology and studies of Dark Energy. This science requires the

transfer rate at the periastron of the binary orbit, we find that, depending on
the initial binary properties at the onset of mass transfer, the orbital
semi-major axis and eccentricity can either increase or decrease at a rate
linearly proportional to the magnitude of the mass transfer rate at periastron.
The range of initial binary mass ratios and eccentricities that leads to
increasing orbital semi-major axes and eccentricities broadens with increasing
degrees of mass loss from the system and narrows with increasing orbital
angular momentum loss from the binary. Comparison with tidal evolution
timescales shows that the usual assumption of rapid circularization at the

Carlo algorithm for sampling the posterior distribution function. Such
distribution results from combining all a-priori knowledge about the parameters
of the model and the information introduced by the observations. The main
difficulty resides in the fact that the model used to explain the observations

reason, we apply a set of artificial neural networks that are used to
approximate and interpolate a database of models. As a consequence, models not
present in the original database can be computed ensuring continuity. We focus
on the application of this solution scheme to the recently developed public
database of clumpy dusty torus models. The machine learning scheme used in this
paper allows us to generate any model from the database using only a factor
10^-4 of the original size of the database and a factor 10^-3 in computing
time. The posterior distribution obtained for each model parameter allows us to
investigate how the observations constrain the parameters and which ones remain
partially or completely undetermined, providing statistically relevant
confidence intervals. As an example, the application to the nuclear region of

energy. Such a condition is not equivalent to the conventional micro-canonical
condition, because the latter limits the participating eigenstates to a very
narrow energy window. The statistics is obtained analytically for both the
entire system and its small subsystem. In a significant departure from the
Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics, the average occupation numbers of quantum states
exhibit in the present case weak algebraic dependence on energy. In the
macroscopic limit, this dependence is routinely accompanied by the condensation
into the lowest energy quantum state. This work contains initial numerical
tests of the above statistics for finite systems, and also reports the
following numerical finding: When the basis states of large but finite random
matrix Hamiltonians are expanded in terms of eigenstates, the participation of
eigenstates in such an expansion obeys the newly obtained statistics. The above
statistics might be observable in small quantum systems, but for the
macroscopic systems, it rather reenforces doubts about self-sufficiency of
non-relativistic quantum mechanics for justifying the Boltzmann-Gibbs
equilibrium.

the local universe. We demonstrate an evolution in the strength of the radio
power and the spectroscopic emission-lines typical of AGN, as well as in the
morphology of their hosts. Such evolution appears more substantial for less
luminous systems, and is possibly the low-redshift tail of the downsizing in
star-formation, AGN activity and supermassive black hole build-up observed in
higher redshift surveys.This suggests that the differences in intrinsic
properties of galaxies along the Hubble Sequence may arise from the difference
in the depth of their potential wells which leads to different evolutionary
paths because of different timescales for gas infall. This primordial infall
and the following secular evolution mediated by bar and density wave
instabilities may bring galaxies of different mass to have the different
activity levels and morphological features in the local universe shown in this
study. In agreement with such a hypothesis, we find that star-formation as
traced by radio emission is progressively more centrally concentrated in more

using data from the Taurus Spitzer Legacy Survey. The MIPS 160 micron image
shows both extended emission from the Taurus cloud as well as emission from
multiple cold cores over a 1 X 2 deg region. Analysis shows that the cloud dust
temperature is 14.2 +- 0.4 K and the extinction ratio is A_160/A_K = 0.010 +-
0.001 up to A_V ~ 4 mag. We find kappa_160 = 0.23 +- 0.046 cm^2/g for the
specific opacity of the gas-dust mixture. Therefore, for dust in the Taurus
cloud we find the 160 um opacity is significantly higher than that measured for
the diffuse ISM, but not too different from dense cores, even at modest
extinction values. Furthermore, the 160 um image shows features that do not
appear in the IRAS 100 um image. We identify six regions as cold cores, i.e.
colder than 14.2 K, all of which have counterparts in extinction maps or C18O
maps. We compare the effects of L1521F IRS on its natal core and find there is
no evidence for dust heating at 160 or 100 um by the embedded source. From the
infrared luminosity L_TIR = 0.024 Lo we find L_bol = 0.034 - 0.046L_o, thus
confirming the source's low-luminosity. Comparison of L1521F IRS with
theoretical simulations for the very early phases of star formation appears to
rule out the first core collapse phase. The evolutionary state appears similar
to or younger than the class 0 phase, and the estimated mass is likely to be
substellar.

comprehensive investigation of 22 planetary systems in an effort to answer
three questions: 1) Are there additional planets? 2) Where could additional
planets reside in stable orbits? and 3) What limits can these observations
place on such objects? We find no evidence for additional bodies in any of

planets (HD 20367b: Udry et al. 2003, HD 74156d: Bean et al. 2008, and 47 UMa

22 systems have large regions in which additional planets could exist in stable

to close-in Neptune-mass planets for most of the systems targeted. We conclude
with a discussion on the implications of these non-detections.

unstably, resulting in a helium flash. As the donor mass and Mdot decrease, the
ignition mass increases and eventually becomes larger than the donor mass,
yielding a ""last-flash"" ignition mass of < 0.1 Msol. Bildsten et al. (2007)
predicted that the largest outbursts of these systems will lead to dynamical

the He-burning shells in more detail. We calculate maximum achievable
temperatures as well as the minimum envelope masses that achieve dynamical
burning conditions, finding that AM CVn systems with accretors > 0.8 Msol will
undergo dynamical burning. Triple-alpha reactions during the hydrostatic
evolution set a lower limit to the 12C mass fraction of 0.001 - 0.05 when
dynamical burning occurs, but core dredge-up may yield 12C, 16O, and/or 20Ne

accretion and convective phases, but regardless of 14N's fate, the

gravitational waves at microwave frequencies. The quantum mechanical
non-localizability of the negatively charged Cooper pairs, which is protected
from the localizing effect of decoherence by an energy gap, causes the pairs to
undergo non-picturable, non-geodesic motion in the presence of a gravitational
wave. This non-geodesic motion, which is accelerated motion through space,
leads to the existence of mass and charge supercurrents inside the
superconducting film. On the other hand, the decoherence-induced localizability
of the positively charged ions in the lattice causes them to undergo
picturable, geodesic motion as they are carried along with space in the
presence of the same gravitational wave. The resulting separation of charges
leads to a virtual plasma excitation within the film that enormously enhances
its interaction with the wave, relative to that of a neutral superfluid or any
normal matter. The existence of strong mass supercurrents within a
superconducting film in the presence of a gravitational wave, dubbed the
""Heisenberg-Coulomb effect,"" implies the specular reflection of a gravitational
microwave from a film whose thickness is much less than the London penetration
depth of the material, in close analogy with the electromagnetic case. The
argument is developed by allowing classical gravitational fields, which obey
Maxwell-like equations, to interact with quantum matter, which is described
using the BCS and Ginzburg-Landau theories of superconductivity, as well as a
collisionless plasma model. Several possible experimental tests of these ideas,
including mesoscopic ones, are presented alongside comments on the broader
theoretical implications of the central hypothesis.

complex networks that remain incompletely characterized. In particular, drug
intervention can be seen as control of signaling in cellular networks.
Identification of control parameters presents an extreme challenge due to the
combinatorial explosion of control possibilities in combination therapy and to
the incomplete knowledge of the systems biology of cells. In this review paper
we describe the main current and proposed approaches to the design of
combinatorial therapies, including the empirical methods used now by clinicians
and alternative approaches suggested recently by several authors. New
approaches for designing combinations arising from systems biology are
described. We discuss in special detail the design of algorithms that identify
optimal control parameters in cellular networks based on a quantitative
characterization of control landscapes, maximizing utilization of incomplete
knowledge of the state and structure of intracellular networks. The use of new
technology for high-throughput measurements is key to these new approaches to
combination therapy and essential for the characterization of control
landscapes and implementation of the algorithms. Combinatorial optimization in
medical therapy is also compared with the combinatorial optimization of
engineering and materials science and similarities and differences are
delineated.

sampler. Often at least one of the Gibbs updates is replaced with a

random sequence and random scans. While these strategies can ease MCMC
implementation and produce superior empirical performance compared to
full-dimensional updates, the theoretical convergence properties of the
associated Markov chains have received limited attention. We present conditions
under which some component-wise Markov chains converge to the stationary

connections between the convergence rates of the various component-wise
strategies. This is important since it ensures the existence of tools that an
MCMC practitioner can use to be as confident in the simulation results as if

test of these models, we use X-ray and H-alpha data of the two massive,
quiescent edge-on spirals NGC 5746 and NGC 5170 to investigate the amount and
origin of any hot gas in their halos. Contrary to our earlier claim, the
Chandra analysis of NGC 5746, employing more recent calibration data, does not
reveal any significant evidence for diffuse X-ray emission outside the optical
disk, with a 3-sigma upper limit to the halo X-ray luminosity of 4e39 erg/s. An
identical study of the less massive NGC 5170 also fails to detect any
extraplanar X-ray emission. By extracting hot halo properties of disk galaxies
formed in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, we compare these results to
expectations for cosmological accretion of hot gas by spirals. For Milky
Way-sized galaxies, these high-resolution simulations predict hot halo X-ray
luminosities which are lower by a factor of ~2 compared to our earlier results
reported by Toft et al. (2002). We find the new simulation predictions to be
consistent with our observational constraints for both NGC 5746 and NGC 5170,
while also confirming that the hot gas detected so far around more actively
star-forming spirals is in general probably associated with stellar activity in
the disk. Observational results on quiescent disk galaxies at the high-mass end
are nevertheless providing powerful constraints on theoretical predictions, and
hence on the assumed input physics in numerical studies of disk galaxy
formation and evolution.

correspond to the critical point of QCD. To characterize the phase transition
at this critical point, the critical exponent of the correlation function can
be determined by measuring the L\'evy index of stability of the Bose-Einstein

from fits to the multiplicity distribution in various pseudorapidity intervals,
also as a function of colliding energy, system size, centrality and (chemical)
freeze-out temperature. These two critical exponents determine the remaining
four critical exponents and the universality class of this second order phase
transition. As a control experiment, the determination of the critical exponent
of the specific heat capacity is proposed, from event-by-event fluctuation
measurements. To measure opacity precisely, well calibrated high transverse
momentum probes are needed, such as given by the excitation function of

across DNA strands while they translocate through a nanopore or channel may
provide a statistically distinguishable signature of the DNA bases, and may
thus allow for rapid DNA sequencing. However, fluctuations of the environment,
such as ionic and DNA motion, introduce important scattering processes that may
affect the viability of this approach to sequencing. To understand this issue,
we have analyzed a simple model that captures the role of this complex
environment in electronic dephasing and its ability to remove charge carriers
from current-carrying states. We find that these effects do not strongly
influence the current distributions due to the off-resonant nature of tunneling
through the nucleotides - a result we expect to be a common feature of
transport in molecular junctions. In particular, only large scattering
strengths, as compared to the energetic gap between the molecular states and
the Fermi level, significantly alter the form of the current distributions.
Since this gap itself is quite large, the current distributions remain
protected from this type of noise, further supporting the possibility of using
transverse electronic transport measurements for DNA sequencing.

and column density variations, both spatially and temporally, are observed with
typical variations at the level of \Delta\tau ~ 0.20 and in some cases as large
as \Delta\tau ~ 0.70, corresponding to column density fluctuations of order 5 x
10^{19} cm^{-2} for an assumed 50 K spin temperature. The typical angular scale
is 15 mas; while the distance to the absorbing gas is highly uncertain, the
equivalent linear scale is likely to be about 10 AU. Approximately 10% of the
face of the source is covered by these opacity variations, probably implying a
volume filling factor for the small-scale absorbing gas of no more than about
1%. Comparing our results with earlier results toward 3C 138 (Brogan et al.),
we find numerous similarities, and we conclude that small-scale absorbing gas
is a ubiquitous phenomenon, albeit with a low probability of intercept on any
given line of sight. Further, we compare the volumes sampled by the line of
sight through the Galaxy between our two epochs and conclude that, on the basis
of the motion of the Sun alone, these two volumes are likely to be
substantially different. In order to place more significant constraints on the
various models for the origin of these small-scale structures, more frequent
sampling is required in any future observations.

resolution angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES). The extracted
width of the spectral function (inverse of the photo-hole lifetime) near the H
point is approximately proportional to the energy as expected from the linearly
increasing density of states (DOS) near the Fermi energy. This is well
accounted by our electron-phonon coupling theory considering the peculiar
electronic DOS near the Fermi level. And we also investigated the temperature
dependence of the peak widths both experimentally and theoretically. The upper
bound for the electron-phonon coupling parameter is ~0.23, nearly the same
value as previously reported at the K point. Our analysis of temperature
dependent ARPES data at K shows that the energy of phonon mode of graphite has
much higher energy scale than 125K which is dominant in electron-phonon
coupling.

unit cell of a non-centrosymmetric dielectric crystal result in the appearance
of a net dipole moment: a phenomenon well known as piezoelectricity. A
macroscopic strain gradient on the other hand can induce polarization in
dielectrics of any crystal structure, even those which possess a
centrosymmetric lattice. This phenomenon, called flexoelectricity, has both
bulk and surface contributions: the strength of the bulk contribution can be
characterized by means of a material property tensor called the bulk
flexoelectric tensor. Several recent studies suggest that strain-gradient
induced polarization may be responsible for a variety of interesting and
anomalous electromechanical phenomena in materials including electromechanical
coupling effects in non-uniformly strained nanostructures, dead layer effects
in nanocapacitor systems, and giant piezoelectricity in perovskite
nanostructures among others. In this work, adopting a lattice dynamics based
microscopic approach we provide estimates of the flexoelectric tensor for
certain cubic ionic crystals, perovskite dielectrics, III-V and II-VI
semiconductors. We compare our estimates with experimental and theoretical
values wherever available, address the discrepancy that exists between
different experimental estimates and also re-visit the validity of an existing
empirical scaling relationship for the magnitude of flexoelectric coefficients

assumed as a proxy for the node's importance or prominence within the network.
It is known that social networks exhibit the (first-order) assortative mixing,
i.e. if two nodes are connected, they tend to have similar node degrees,
suggesting that people tend to mix with those of comparable prominence. In this
paper, we report the second-order assortative mixing in social networks. If two
nodes are connected, we measure the degree correlation between their most
prominent neighbours, rather than between the two nodes themselves. We observe
very strong second-order assortative mixing in social networks, often
significantly stronger than the first-order assortative mixing. This suggests
that if two people interact in a social network, then the importance of the
most prominent person each knows is very likely to be the same. This is also
true if we measure the average prominence of neighbours of the two people. This
property is weaker or negative in non-social networks. We investigate a number
of possible explanations for this property. However, none of them was found to
provide an adequate explanation. We therefore conclude that second-order
assortative mixing is a new property of social networks.

Flow model, based on an anisotropic Flow Enhancement factor (CAFFE model) is
given. The CAFFE model is an application of the theory of mixtures with
continuous diversity for the case of large polar ice masses in which induced
anisotropy occurs. The anisotropic response of the polycrystalline ice is
described by a generalization of Glen's flow law, based on a scalar anisotropic
enhancement factor. The enhancement factor depends on the orientation mass
density, which is closely related to the orientation distribution function and
describes the distribution of grain orientations (fabric). Fabric evolution is
governed by the orientation mass balance, which depends on four distinct
effects, interpreted as local rigid body rotation, grain rotation, rotation
recrystallization (polygonization) and grain boundary migration (migration
recrystallization), respectively. It is proven that the flow law of the CAFFE
model is truly anisotropic despite the collinearity between the stress deviator
and stretching tensors.

down to the CM phase, the magnetic chirality is proportional to the electric
polarization. Also we confirmed that the magnetic chirality can be switched by
the polarity of the electric polarization in both the CM and LT-ICM phases.
These facts suggest an intimate coupling between the magnetic chirality and the
electric polarization. However, upon the transition from the CM to LT-ICM
phase, the reduction of the electric polarization is not accompanied by any
reduction of the magnetic chirality, implying that the CM and LT-ICM phases
contain different mechanisms of the magnetoelectric coupling.

a submillimeter clump. We find v_LSR varies little across any of the Cores, and
additionally varies by only ~1.5 km/s between them. The observed NH3 line
widths within the Oph B and F Cores are generally large and often mildly
supersonic, while Oph C is characterized by narrow line widths which decrease
to nearly thermal values. We find several regions of localized narrow line
emission (\Delta v < 0.4 km/s), some of which are associated with NH3 clumps.
We derive the kinetic temperatures of the gas, and find they are remarkably
constant across Oph B and F, with a warmer mean value (T_K = 15 K) than
typically found in isolated regions and consistent with previous results in
clustered regions. Oph C, however, has a mean T_K = 12 K, decreasing to a
minimum T_K = 9.4 K towards the submillimeter continuum peak, similar to
previous studies of isolated starless cores. There is no significant difference
in temperature towards protostars embedded in the Cores. [Abridged]

stratified fluids. We start by deriving a reduced PDE, the GGG model,
consisting of only wave-mode interactions. In principle, comparing this model
to the full rotating Boussinesq system allows us to gauge the importance of
wave-vortical-wave vs. wave-wave-wave interactions in determining the transfer
and distribution of wave-mode energy. As in many atmosphere-ocean phenomena we
work in a skewed aspect ratio domain (H/L) with Fr = Ro < 1 such that Bu = 1.
Our focus is on the equilibration of wave-mode energy and its spectral scaling
under the influence of random large-scale forcing. As anticipated, when forcing
is applied to all modes, with Fr=Ro ~ 0.05 and H/L=1/5, the wave-mode energy
equilibrates and its spectrum scales as a power-law. For the same parameters,
when forcing is restricted to only wave modes, the energy fails to equilibrate
in both the full system as well as the GGG subsystem at resolutions we can
achieve. This cleary demonstrates the importance of the vortical mode in
determining the wave-mode energy distribution. Proceeding to the second set of
simulations, i.e. for the larger Fr=Ro ~ 0.1 in a less skewed aspect ratio
domain with H/L=1/3, we observe that the energy of the GGG subsystem
equilibrates. Further, the full system with forcing restricted to wave modes
also equilbrates and both yield identical energy spectra. Thus it is clear that
the wave-wave-wave interactions play a role in the overall dynamics at moderate
Ro, Fr and aspect ratios. Apart from theoretical concerns, these results
highlight the difficulty in properly resolving wave-mode interactions when
simulating realistic geophysical phenomena.

are considered which specify the odds ratio function up to an unknown parameter
$\bolds\theta$. These models are shown to be semiparametric in the sense that
they do not restrict the marginal distributions of $X$ and $Y$. Inference for
the odds ratio parameter $\bolds\theta$ may be obtained from sampling either
$Y$ conditionally on $X$ or vice versa. Generalizing results from Prentice and
Pyke, Weinberg and Wacholder and Scott and Wild, we show that asymptotic
inference for $\bolds\theta$ under sampling conditional on $Y$ is the same as
if sampling had been conditional on $X$. Common regression models, for example,
generalized linear models with canonical link or multivariate linear,
respectively, logistic models, are association models where the regression
parameter $\bolds\beta$ is closely related to the odds ratio parameter
$\bolds\theta$. Hence inference for $\bolds\beta$ may be drawn from samples
conditional on $Y$ using an association model.

large number of microscopic black holes of primordial or a non-primordial
origin. All of them undergo orbital motion, under the action of gravity, around
their common center of mass. Four classes of Macro Holeum emerge: H, BH, HH and
LH. The latter is a massless bundle of gravitational energy moving at the speed
of light. The others are Dark Matter objects. BH emits Hawking radiation but
the others do not. The presently existing black holes are identified with BH.
All, except LH, emit gravitational radiation due to internal quantum
transitions. Simple analytic formulae are derived for the energy eigenvalues,
mass, radius, density and the frequency of the gravitational radiation emitted
by Macro Holeums in terms of just two parameters which can be determined from
the gravitational spectra. We predict that black holes have internal structure
and that they and other Macro Holeums, having masses in the range 57 solar
masses to 870 solar masses, would emit hydrogen-like gravitational radiation in
the LIGO frequency range in the form of band or line spectra with a
considerable overlapping of the bands. This will be superposed on a uniform
background radiation coming from Macro Holeums at large distances greater than
100 Mpc.

emission in the axisymmetric pulsar magnetosphere that is quite different from
the canonical paradigm of radio emission coming from the magnetic polar caps.
In this first paper we consider only the axisymmetric case of an aligned
rotator. Our picture capitalizes on an important element of the MHD
representation of the magnetosphere, namely the separatrix between the
corotating closed-line region (the `dead zone') and the open field lines that
originate in the polar caps. Along the separatrix flows the return current that
corresponds to the main magnetospheric electric current emanating from the
polar caps. Across the separatrix, both the toroidal and poloidal components of
the magnetic field change discontinuously. The poloidal component discontinuity
requires the presence of a significant annular electric current which has up to
now been unaccounted for. We estimate the position and thickness of this
annular current at the tip of the closed line region, and show that it consists
of electrons (positrons) corotating with Lorentz factors on the order of 10^5,
emitting incoherent synchrotron radiation that peaks in the hard X-rays. These
particles stay in the region of highest annular current close to the equator
for a path-length of the order of one meter. We propose that, at wavelengths
comparable to that path-length, the particles emit coherent radiation, with
radiated power proportional to N^2, where N is the population of particles in
the above path-length. We calculate the total radio power in this wavelength
regime and its scaling with pulsar period and stellar magnetic field and show
that it is consistent with estimates of radio luminosity based on observations.

clusters within the Galaxy in order to appropriately fuel the multiple

the fountain flows: the freshly ejected metals tend to fall back close to the
same Galactocentric region where they are delivered. Therefore, the fountains
do not change significantly the radial profile of the disk chemical abundance.
The multiple fountains simulations also allowed to consistently calculate the
feedback of the star formation on the halo gas. Finally, we have also
considered the possibility of mass infall from the intergalactic medium and its
interaction with the clouds that are formed by the fountains. Though our
simulations are not suitable to reproduce the slow rotational pattern that is
typically observed in the halos around the disk galaxies, they indicate that
the presence of an external gas infall may help to slow down the rotation of
the gas in the clouds and thus the amount of angular momentum that they
transfer to the coronal gas, as previously suggested in the literature.

the spiral tracer data of our Milky Way from the literature, namely, HII
regions and giant molecular clouds (GMCs). With weighting factors based on the
excitation parameters of HII regions or the masses of GMCs, we fitted the
distribution of these tracers with models of two, three, four spiral-arms or
polynomial spiral arms. The distances of tracers, if not available from stellar
or direct measurements, were estimated kinetically from the standard rotation
curve of Brand & Blitz (1993) with $R_0$=8.5 kpc, and $\Theta_0$=220 km
s$^{-1}$ or the newly fitted rotation curves with $R_0$=8.0 kpc and
$\Theta_0$=220 km s$^{-1}$ or $R_0$=8.4 kpc and $\Theta_0$=254 km s$^{-1}$. We
found that the two-arm logarithmic model cannot fit the data in many regions.
The three- and the four-arm logarithmic models are able to connect most
tracers. However, at least two observed tangential directions cannot be matched
by the three- or four-arm model. We composed a polynomial spiral arm model,
which can not only fit the tracer distribution but also match observed
tangential directions. Using new rotation curves with $R_0$=8.0 kpc and
$\Theta_0$=220 km s$^{-1}$ and $R_0$=8.4 kpc and $\Theta_0$=254 km s$^{-1}$ for

accretion onto galaxies at high redshifts occurs on a halo dynamical time
allowing for very efficiently sustained star formation. In addition cold
accretion flows are able to drive turbulence in high redshift disks at the
level observed if at least 20% of the accretion energy is converted into random
motion in the gaseous disk. In general we find that the fraction of gas
involved in galaxy mergers is a strong function of time and increases with
redshift. A model combining the role of dissipation during mergers and
continued infall of satellite galaxies allows to reproduce the observed

that it is difficult to generate enough massive disk galaxies with B/T $< 0.2$
via major mergers and subsequent disk re-growth, if during the major merger
progenitor disks get disrupted completely. On average low B/T galaxies must
have had there last major merger at $z \ge 2$. The main limiting factor is the
ability to re-grow massive disks at late times after the last major merger of a
galaxy. Taking into account the contribution from minor mergers ($4 \ge
M_1/M_2$, $M_1 \ge M_2$) to the formation of bulges, we recover the right
fraction of massive low B/T disk galaxies, indicating that minor mergers play

emotion expression through rendered and robotic faces. A smaller part is
concerned with modeling the effects of emotion, formal modeling of cognitive
appraisal theory and models of emergent emotions. Part of the motivation for
affective computing as a field is to better understand emotional processes
through computational modeling. One of the four major topics in affective
computing is computers that have emotions (the others are recognizing,
expressing and understanding emotions). A critical and neglected aspect of
having emotions is the experience of emotion (Barrett, Mesquita, Ochsner, and
Gross, 2007): what does the content of an emotional episode look like, how does
this content change over time and when do we call the episode emotional. Few
modeling efforts have these topics as primary focus. The launch of a journal on
synthetic emotions should motivate research initiatives in this direction, and
this research should have a measurable impact on emotion research in
psychology. I show that a good way to do so is to investigate the psychological
core of what an emotion is: an experience. I present ideas on how the
experience of emotion could be modeled and provide evidence that several
computational models of emotion are already addressing the issue.

homopolymer undergoes transitions from a random coil to a helix, helical
hairpin \textbf{HH}, and helix bundle \textbf{HB} structures depending on $N$,
and temperature. Crowding induces chain compaction that can promote \textbf{HH}

decreases which is reflected in the decrease in the transition temperatures
that depend on $\phi_c$, $N$, and the size of the crowding particles.

(QCLA) using measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC), called MBQCLA. QCLA
was originally designed for an abstract, concurrent architecture supporting
long-distance communication, but most realistic architectures heavily constrain
communication distances. The quantum carry-lookahead adder is faster than a
quantum ripple-carry adder; QCLA has logarithmic depth while ripple adders have
linear depth. MBQCLA utilizes MBQC's ability to transfer quantum states in unit
time to accelerate addition. MBQCLA breaks the latency limit of addition
circuits in nearest neighbor-only architectures : compared to the $\Theta(n)$
limit on circuit depth for linear nearest-neighbor architectures, it can reach
$\Theta(log n)$ depth. MBQCLA is an order of magnitude faster than a
ripple-carry adder when adding registers longer than 100 qubits, but requires a
cluster state that is an order of magnitude larger. The cluster state resources
can be classified as computation and communication; for the unoptimized form,
$\approx$ 88 % of the resources are used for communication. Hand optimization
of horizontal communication costs results in a $\approx$ 12% reduction in
spatial resources for the in-place MBQCLA circuit. For comparison, a graph
state quantum carry-lookahead adder (GSQCLA) uses only $\approx$ 9 % of the
spatial resources of the MBQCLA.

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) inferred that LIG global sea

levels differ from GSL, accurately reconstructing past GSL requires an

range. The aim of the study is to compare the NIR spectral properties of radio
galaxies to those of inactive early-type galaxies and, furthermore, produce the
first NIR HK-band spectra for low redshift radio galaxies. For both samples
spectral indices of several diagnostic absorption features, SiI(1.589microns),
CO(1.619microns), NaI(2.207microns), CaI(2.263microns), CO(>2.29microns), were
measured. To characterize the age of the populations, the measured EWs of the
absorption features were fitted with the corresponding theoretical evolutionary
curves of the EWs calculated by the stellar synthesis model. On average, EW(CO
2.29) of radio galaxies is somewhat greater than that of inactive ellipticals.
Most likely, EW(CO 2.29) is not significantly affected by dilution, and thus
indicating that elliptical galaxies containing AGN are in a different stage in
their evolution than inactive ellipticals. This is also supported by comparing
other NIR features, such as CaI and NaI, with each other. Absorption features
are consistent with the intermediate age stellar population, suggesting that
host galaxies contain both an old and intermediate age components. It is
consistent with previous optical spectroscopy studies which have shown evidence
on the intermediate age (~2 Gyr) stellar population of radio galaxies, and also
in some of the early-type galaxies. The existence of intermediate age
population is a link between the star formation episode, possibly induced by
interaction or merging event, and the triggering of the nuclear activity.

of cosmological models. Effective pseudoscalar-photon interaction(s) would
induce a rotation of linear polarization of electromagnetic wave propagating

observations are superb tests of these models and have the potential to
discover new fundamental physics. Pseudoscalar-photon interaction is
proportional to the gradient of the pseudoscalar field. From phenomenological
point of view, this gradient could be neutrino number asymmetry, other density
current, or a constant vector. In these situations, Lorentz invariance or CPT
may effectively be violated. In this paper, we review these results and
anticipate what more precise observations can tell us about fundamental
physics, inflation, etc. Better accuracy in CMB polarization observation is
expected from PLANCK mission to be launched this year. Dedicated CMB
polarization observers like B-Pol mission, CMBpol mission and LiteBIRD mission
would probe this fundamental issue more deeply in the future. With these
sensitivities, cosmic polarization rotations from effective pseudoscalar-photon
interaction, Faraday polarization rotations from primordial and large-scale
magnetic field, and tensor modes effects would have chances to be detected and
distinguished. The subtracted tensor-mode effects are likely due to primordial
gravitational waves. We discuss the direct detectability of these primordial

30 years ago with HEAO-C1, detecting the first interstellar gamma-ray line from
26Al, then with SMM and numerous balloon experiments, among their results the
detection of radioactivity from supernova SN1987A, and with the Compton
Observatory and its OSSE and COMPTEL instruments in 1991-2000, which performed
sky surveys in 26Al and 511 keV annihilation emission and the detection of the
Cas A supernova remnant in 44Ti radioactivity. The SPI high-resolution Ge
spectrometer on INTEGRAL was launched in 2002 and continues to collect data on
astrophysically-important gamma-ray lines from decays of 44Ti, 26Al, 60Fe, and
positron annihilation. 44Ti decay lines from Cas A have been observed with both
INTEGRAL telescopes, and constrain the expansion dynamics of the ejecta. The
lack of other 44Ti remnants is a mystery. The 26Al gamma-ray line is now
measured throughout the Galaxy, tracing the kinematics of interstellar gas near
massive stars, and highlighting special regions of interest therein, such as
groups of massive stars in Cygnus and even more nearby regions. The detection
of 60Fe radioactivity lines at the level of 15% of the 26Al flux presents a
challenge both for observers and models. Positron annihilation emission from
the nucleosynthesis regions within the Galactic plane appears to be mainly from
26Al and other supernova radioactivity, while the bulge's positron annihilation

ideal case when no recording device is present. The decline in the image

Our studies demonstrate that the temperature in the condensation zone
determines the formation pathway of carbonaceous particles. At temperatures
lower than 1700 K, the condensation by-products are mainly polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs), that are also the precursors or building blocks for the
condensing soot grains. The low-temperature condensates contain PAH mixtures
that are mainly composed of volatile 3-5 ring systems. At condensation
temperatures higher than 3500 K, fullerene-like carbon grains and fullerene
compounds are formed. Fullerene fragments or complete fullerenes equip the
nucleating particles. Fullerenes can be identified as soluble components.
Consequently, condensation products in cool and hot astrophysical environments
such as cool and hot AGB stars or Wolf Rayet stars should be different and
should have distinct spectral properties.

after combining them with the other uncertainties. Based on this consistency,
we conclude that the previous scattering length determinations seem to be
rather solid and reliable, with the cO(p^6) low-energy constants quite under

the limitation on further improvements unless the precision of the O(p^6)

improving novices skills and knowledge on the essentials of programming by
using e-learning based approaches in connection (at least conceptually) with a
general host framework like Activemath (www.activemath.org). Our elaboration
covers contextual and, particularly, cognitive elements preparing the terrain

our main efforts on reasoning mechanisms about exercise complexity that can
eventually offer tool support for the task of exercise authoring. We base our
requirements analysis on our own perception of the exercise subsystem provided
by Activemath especially within the domain reasoner area. We enrich the
analysis by bringing to the discussion several relevant contextual elements
from the CS1 courses, its definition and implementation. Concerning cognitive
models and exercises, we build upon the principles of Bloom's Taxonomy as a
relatively standardized basis and use them as a framework for study and
analysis of complexity in basic programming exercises. Our analysis includes
requirements for the domain reasoner which are necessary for the exercise
analysis. We propose for such a purpose a three-layered conceptual model
considering exercise evaluation, programming and metaprogramming.
