performance of both the Friends-of-Friends (FOF) and Voronoi-Delaunay-Method

independently created FOF and VDM catalogues. The final completeness and purity
of this catalogue, both in terms of the groups and of individual members,
compares favorably with recent results in the literature. The current group
catalogue contains 102 groups with N >= 5 spectroscopically confirmed members,
with a further ~700 groups with 2 <= N <= 4. Most of the groups can be assigned
a velocity dispersion and a dark-matter mass derived from the mock catalogues,
with quantifiable uncertainties. The fraction of zCOSMOS galaxies in groups is
about 25% at low redshift and decreases toward ~15% at z ~ 0.8. The zCOSMOS
group catalogue is broadly consistent with that expected from the semi-analytic
evolution model underlying the mock catalogues. Not least, we show that the
number density of groups with a given intrinsic richness increases from
redshift z ~ 0.8 to the present, consistent with the hierarchical growth of

use in quantum walk algorithms with polynomial speedups, whose complexity is
usually measured in terms of how many times we have to apply a step of a
quantum walk, compared to the number of necessary classical Markov chain steps.
We consider a finer notion of complexity including the number of elementary
gates it takes to implement each step of the quantum walk with some desired
accuracy. The difference in complexity for various implementation approaches is
that our method scales linearly in the sparsity parameter and
poly-logarithmically with the inverse of the desired precision. The best
previously known general methods either scale quadratically in the sparsity
parameter, or polynomially in the inverse precision. Our approach is especially
relevant for implementing quantum walks corresponding to classical random walks
like those used in the classical algorithms for approximating permanents and
sampling from binary contingency tables. In those algorithms, the sparsity
parameter grows with the problem size, while maintaining high precision is
required.

case that shows extreme bimodal divergence. The divergent behaviour occurs in
two different types of code and is independent of all numerical parameters. We
identify and give explicit illustrations of several sources of stochasticity,

differences at the round-off error level. We obtain somewhat more consistent
results from simulations in which the halo is set up with great care compared
with those started from more approximate equilibria, but we have been unable to
eliminate diverging behaviour entirely because the main sources of
stochasticity are intrinsic to the disc. We show that the divergence is only
temporary and that halo friction is merely delayed, for a substantial time in
some cases. We argue that the delays are unlikely to arise in real galaxies,
and that our results do not affect dynamical friction constraints on halo
density. Stochastic variations in the evolution are inevitable in all
simulations of disc-halo systems, irrespective of how they were created,

description of monodromy map, associated with a connection on a trivial bundle
over a 1-connected manifold. We regard it as a homomorphism from the algebra of
differential forms on the structure group to the algebra of differential forms
on the based loopspace of the base, represented by the (reduced) bar-complex of
differential forms on it. Next we discuss the notion of ""twisting cochains"", or
more generally ""twisting maps"", their equivalence relation and give various
examples. We show that every twisting map gives rise to a map from the
coalgebra to the bar-resolution of the algebra. Further we show that in the
case of genuine twisting cochains one can obtain a map from the differential
forms on the gauge bundle, associated with the given principal one, to the
reduced Hochschild complex of the algebra, of differential forms of the base.
Then we discuss a concrete example of a twisting cochain that is defined on the
polynomial de Rham forms on an algebraic group and takes values in Cech complex
of the base. We show how it can be used to obtain explicit formulas for the
Chern classes. We also discuss few modifications of this construction. In the
last section we discuss the construction, similar to the one, used by Getzler,
Jones and Petrack in their 1991 paper. We show that the map we call
""Getzler-Jones-Petrack's map"" is homotopy-equivalent to the map that one
obtains from a twisting cochain. This enables us to find a generalization of
the Bismut's class, which we regard as an image of a suitable element in the

emitters of strong He+ Lyman continua that in turn could ionize observable
HeIII regions, i.e. highly excited HII regions emitting nebular HeII4686
emission. We here report the discovery of a rare HeIII region in the SMC which
is located in the OB association NGC249 around the weak-lined WN star SMC WR10.
WR10 is particularly interesting since it is a single star showing the presence
of atmospheric hydrogen. While analysing the spectrum in the framework of two
popular WR atmosphere models, we found for the same input parameters strongly
discrepant predictions (by 1 dex) for the He+ Lyman continuum. A second aspect
of the work reported here concerns the beautiful MCELS images which clearly
reveal a class of strongly [OIII]5007 emitting (blue-coded) nebulae. Not
unexpectedly, most of the 'blue' nebulae are known Wolf-Rayet bubbles, but new
bubbles around a few WRs are also detected. Moreover, we report the existence
of blue nebulae without associated known WRs and discuss the possibility that
they reveal weak-wind WR stars with very faint stellar HeII4686 emission.
Alternatively, such nebulae might hint at the hitherto missing population of
relatively low-mass, hot He stars predicted by massive binary evolution
calculations. Such a binary system is probably responsible for the ionization

variety of novel and fascinating phenomena. These properties may have wide
applications, but their underlying mechanisms have not been completely
understood. From calculations of surface charge density waves on conducting
gratings and by comparing them with classical surface plasmons, we revealed a
general yet concrete picture about coupling of light to free electron
oscillation on structured conducting surfaces that can lead to oscillating
subwavelength charge patterns (i.e., spoof surface plasmons but without the
dispersion property of classical surface plasmons). New wavelets emitted from
these light sources then destructively interfere to form evanescent waves. This
principle, usually combined with other mechanisms (e.g. resonance), is mainly a
geometrical effect that can be universally involved in light scattering from
all periodic and nonperiodic structures containing free electrons, including
perfect conductors. The spoof surface plasmon picture may provide clear
guidelines for developing metamaterial-based nano-optical devices.

component effective temperatures of 5900+-100K and 5875+-100K, respectively,
for the primary and secondary stars. From their absolute dimensions, the two
components of V12 yield identical distance moduli of Vo-MV=11.24+-0.09,
corresponding to 1770+-75pc. We determine an age of 6.2+-0.2Gyr for V12 and
NGC188, from a comparison with theoretical isochrones in the mass-radius

transformations. We use isochrones from Victoria-Regina (VRSS) and Yonsei-Yale
(Y2) with [Fe/H]=-0.1 and [Fe/H]=0.0. From the solar metallicity isochrones, an
age of 6.4Gyr provides the best fit to the binary components for both sets of
models. For the isochrones with [Fe/H]=-0.1, ages of 6.0Gyr and 5.9Gyr provide
the best fits for the VRSS and Y2 models, respectively. We use the distance and
age estimates for V12, together with best estimates for the metallicity and
reddening of NGC188, to investigate the locations of the corresponding VRSS and
Y2 isochrones relative to cluster members in the color-magnitude diagram.
Plausible changes in model metallicity and distance to better match the
isochrones to the cluster sequences, result in a range of ages for NGC188 that
is more than 3 times that resulting from our analysis of V12.

vertically on the symmetry axis or (2) corotating with the disc and changing
height not far above the disc surface. The most likely explanation for the
observed variability is given by the model involving the X-ray source located
at a very small, varying distance from a rapidly rotating black hole. This
model predicts some enhanced variations in the red wing of the Fe line, which
are not seen in the Suzaku observations. However, the enhanced variability of
the red wing, while ruled out by the Suzaku data, is consistent with an excess
RMS variability, between 5 and 6 keV, reported for some previous ASCA and XMM
observations. We speculate that the presence or lack of such a feature is
related to the change of the ionization state of the innermost part of the
disc, however, investigation of such effects is currently not possible in our
model (where a neutral disc is assumed). If the model, completed by description
of ionization effects, proves to be fully consistent with the observational
data, it will provide a strong indication that the central black hole in

emission component below 1 keV. Both a narrow core and a broader component of
Fe K emission centered at 6.4 keV are robustly detected. While the narrow line
is consistent with an origin in material distant from the black hole, the broad
line is best fit empirically by a model that describes fluorescent emission
from the inner accretion disk around a rapidly rotating black hole. We find no
evidence in this observation for Comptonized reflection of the hard X-ray
source by the disk above 10 keV, however, which casts doubt on the hypothesis
that the broad iron line originates in the inner regions of a standard
accretion disk. We explore other possible scenarios for producing this spectral
feature and conclude that the high equivalent width (EW ~ 185 keV) and
full-width-half-maximum velocity of the broad iron line (v ~ 0.37c) necessitate
an origin within d ~ 8 gravitational radii of the hard X-ray source. Based on
the confirmed presence of a strong radio jet in this galaxy nucleus, the broad
iron line may be produced in dense plasma near the base of the jet, implying
that emission mechanisms in the centralmost portions of active galactic nuclei

%Conversely, the requirement of the existence of hydrodynamic reductions proves
to be an efficient classification criterion. In this paper we adopt a novel

terrestrial-like and further improving potential habitability. We perform

minimize the expected system time (wait plus service) of the demands. The
general problem is known as the m-vehicle Dynamic Traveling Repairman Problem
(m-DTRP). The best previously known control algorithms rely on centralized
a-priori task assignment and are not robust against changes in the environment,
e.g. changes in load conditions; therefore, they are of limited applicability
in scenarios involving ad-hoc networks of autonomous vehicles operating in a
time-varying environment. First, we present a new class of policies for the

changes in load conditions. Second, we show that partitioning policies, whereby
the environment is partitioned among the vehicles and each vehicle follows a
certain set of rules in its own region, are optimal in heavy-load conditions.
Finally, by combining the new class of algorithms for the 1-DTRP with suitable
partitioning policies, we design distributed algorithms for the m-DTRP problem
that (i) are spatially distributed, scalable to large networks, and adaptive to
network changes, (ii) are within a constant-factor of optimal in heavy-load

independent method, which does not utilize directly the diffuse foreground

steps, (i) removal of diffuse foregrounds contamination by making linear
combination of individual maps in harmonic space and (ii) cross-correlation of
foreground cleaned maps to minimize detector noise bias. For temperature power
spectrum we also estimate and subtract residual unresolved point source
contamination in the cross-power spectrum using the point source model provided
by the WMAP science team. Our $TT$, $TE$ and $EE$ power spectra are in good
agreement with the published results of the WMAP science team. The error bars
on the polarization power spectra, however, turn out to be smaller in
comparison to what is obtained by the WMAP science team. We perform detailed
numerical simulations to test for bias in our procedure. We find that the bias
is small in all cases. A negative bias at low $l$ in $TT$ power spectrum has
been pointed in an earlier publication. We find that the bias corrected
quadrupole power ($l(l+1)C_l/2\pi)$ is 532 $\mu K^2$, approximately 2.5 times

0.3$) measurement of matter including dark matter suggest that the present-day
universe consists mainly of repulsive-gravity type `exotic matter' with
negative-pressure often said `dark energy' ($\Omega_{x} = 0.7$). But the nature
of dark energy is mysterious and its puzzling questions, such as why, how,
where and when about the dark energy, are intriguing. In the present paper the
authors attempt to answer these questions while making an effort to reveal the
genesis of dark energy and suggest that `the cosmological nuclear binding
energy liberated during primordial nucleo-synthesis remains trapped for a long
time and then is released free which manifests itself as dark energy in the
universe'. It is also explained why for dark energy the parameter $w = -
{2/3}$. Noting that $ w = 1$ for stiff matter and $w = {1/3}$ for radiation; $w
= - {2/3}$ is for dark energy because $""-1""$ is due to `deficiency of
stiff-nuclear-matter' and that this binding energy is ultimately released as
`radiation' contributing $""+ {1/3}""$, making $w = -1 + {1/3} = - {2/3}$. When
dark energy is released free at $Z = 80$, $w = -{2/3}$. But as on present day
at $Z = 0$ when radiation strength has diminished to $\delta \to 0$, $w = -1 +
\delta{1/3} = - 1$. This, thus almost solves the dark-energy mystery of
negative pressure and repulsive-gravity. The proposed theory makes several
estimates /predictions which agree reasonably well with the astrophysical
constraints and observations. Though there are many candidate-theories, the
proposed model of this paper presents an entirely new approach (cosmological
nuclear energy) as a possible candidate for dark energy.

sketch of the mechanisms, what the important points are and what assumptions

  We adopt a known scenario, in which the charged lepton spectrum is determined
by the vacuum expectation value of a scalar field that takes values on 3-by-3
matrix. Within this scenario, we propose a mechanism, in which the radiative
correction induced by U(3) family gauge interaction cancels the QED radiative
correction to Koide's mass formula. We consider SU(9)\times U(1) symmetry
broken down to U(3)\times O(3) symmetry. This leads to a potential model which
predicts Koide's mass formula and the charged lepton spectrum consistent with
the experimental values, by largely avoiding fine tuning of parameters. These
are discussed within an effective theory, and we argue for its validity and
usefulness.

algorithms that require only gossip communication, i.e., asynchronous,

innovative idea is describing coverage algorithms for robot deployment and
environment partitioning as dynamical systems on a space of partitions. In

find that in addition to the conductance, the universal conductance
fluctuations also feature anisotropy with respect to the magnetic field
direction. This anisotropy can be explained solely from the symmetries
exhibited by the Hamiltonian as well as the relative strengths of the Rashba

ratio from purely electrical measurements.
