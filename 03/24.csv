matter searches, particularly for those detectors that strive to reach the
ton-scale and beyond. This paper discusses the expected neutrino-induced
background spectrum due to several of the most important sources, including
solar, atmospheric, and diffuse supernova neutrinos. The largest rate arises
from $^8$B produced solar neutrinos, providing upwards of $\sim 10^3$ events
per ton-year over all recoil energies for the heaviest nuclear targets. However
the majority of these $^8$B events are expected to be below the recoil
threshold of modern detectors. The remaining neutrino sources are found to
constitute a background to the WIMP-induced recoil rate only if the
WIMP-nucleon cross section is less than $10^{-12}$ pb. Finally the sensitivity
to diffuse supernova neutrino flux for non-electron neutrino flavors is
discussed, and projected flux limits are compared with existing flux limits.

(1976) \cite[Chapter 8, \S 2 Gluing Manifolds Together]{h}, we give a method of
constructing homeomorphisms between two small covers over simple convex
polytopes. As a result we classify, up to homeomorphism, all small covers over
a 3-dimensional prism $P^3(m)$ with $m\geq 3$. We introduce two invariants from
colored prisms and other two invariants from ordinary cohomology rings with
${\Bbb Z}_2$-coefficients of small covers. These invariants can form a complete
invariant system of homeomorphism types of all small covers over a prism in
most cases. Then we show that the cohomological rigidity holds for all small
covers over a prism $P^3(m)$ (i.e., cohomology rings with ${\Bbb
Z}_2$-coefficients of all small covers over a $P^3(m)$ determine their
homeomorphism types). In addition, we also calculate the number of
homeomorphism types of all small covers over $P^3(m)$.

temperature field theory and with extra-dimensional field theories, this
compactification naturally leads to a quantized energy spectrum. As a
consequence of the relation between periodicity and energy arising from the de

The theory, whose fundamental set-up is presented in this paper, turns out to

popular board shapes are the 33-hole cross-shaped board, and the 15-hole
triangle board---we use them as examples throughout. The basic game begins from
a full board with one peg missing and the goal is to finish at a board position
with one peg. First, we discuss ways to solve the basic game on a computer.
Then we consider the problem of quickly distinguishing board positions where
the goal can still be reached (""winning"" board positions) from those where it
cannot. This enables a computer to alert the player if a jump under
consideration leads to a dead end. On the 15-hole triangle board, it is
possible to identify all winning board positions (from any single vacancy
start) by storing a key set of 437 board positions. For the ""central game"" on
the 33-hole cross-shaped board, we can identify all winning board positions by
storing 839,536 board positions. By viewing a successful game as a traversal of
a directed graph of winning board positions, we apply a simple algorithm to
count the number of ways to traverse this graph, and calculate that the total
number of solutions to the central game is 40,861,647,040,079,968. Our analysis
can also determine how quickly we can reach a ""dead board position"", where a
one peg finish is no longer possible.

important systematic error when constraining dark energy properties from weak
gravitational lensing (cosmic shear) surveys. In the absence of perfectly known
galaxy redshifts some modeling of the galaxy intrinsic alignments is likely to
be required to extract the lensing signal to sufficient accuracy. We present a
new model based on the placement of galaxies into dark matter halos. The
central galaxy ellipticity follows the large scale potential and, in the
simplest case, the satellite galaxies point at the halo center. The two-halo
term is then dominated by the linear alignment model and the one-halo term
provides a motivated extension of intrinsic alignment models to small scales.
We provide fitting formulae for the spatial projected source power spectra for
both intrinsic-intrinsic (II) and shear-intrinsic (GI) correlations. We
illustrate the potential impact of ignoring intrinsic alignments on
cosmological parameter constraints from non-tomographic surveys, finding that
sigma_8 could be underestimated by up to the size of the current 1-sigma error
bar from cosmic shear if very small scales are included in the analysis.
Finally, we highlight areas of interest for numerical simulations of dark
matter clustering and galaxy formation that can further constrain the intrinsic
alignment signal.

unresolved strands that are heated impulsively to high temperatures by
nanoflares. The plasma would then have the observed properties (e.g., excess
density compared to static equilibrium) when it cools into the 1-2 MK range. If
this interpretation is correct, then very hot emission should be present
outside of proper flares. It is predicted to be vey faint, however. A critical
element for proving or refuting this hypothesis is the existence of hot, very
faint plasmas which should be at amounts predicted by impulsive heating. We
report on the first comprehensive spectroscopic study of hot plasmas in active
regions. Data from the EIS spectrometer on Hinode were used to construct
emission measure distributions in quiescent active regions in the 1-5 MK
temperature range. The distributions are flat or slowly increasing up to
approximately 3 MK and then fall off rapidly at higher temperatures. We show
that active region models based on impulsive heating can reproduce the observed
EM distributions relatively well. Our results provide strong new evidence that
coronal heating is impulsive in nature.

conductance of a side-gated quantum point contact (QPC) in the presence of
lateral spin-orbit coupling (LSOC). A small difference of bias voltage between
the two side gates (SGs) leads to an inversion asymmetry in the LSOC between
the opposite edges of the channel. In single electron modeling of transport,
this triggers a spontaneous but insignificant spin polarization in the QPC.
However, the spin polarization of the QPC is enhanced substantially when the
effect of electron-electron interaction is included. The spin polarization is
strong enough to result in the occurrence of a conductance plateau at 0.5G0 (G0
= 2e2/h) in the absence of any external magnetic field. In our simulations of a
model QPC device, the 0.5 plateau is found to be quite robust and survives up
to a temperature of 40K. The spontaneous spin polarization and the resulting
magnetization of the QPC can be reversed by flipping the polarity of the source
to drain bias or the potential difference between the two SGs. These numerical
simulations are in good agreement with recent experimental results for
side-gated QPCs made from the low band gap semiconductor InAs.

correct the first emission from the shower taking the Matrix Element

to take into account Matrix Element corrections not only for one, but rather
for several hard emissions from the incoming partons. This can be done at the
price of introducing a separation cut to distinguish a Matrix Element and a
Parton Shower populated regions. In this paper we check the effect of Matrix
Element corrections in PYTHIA and HERWIG and we check that results from these
two generators are consistent. Then we turn to SHERPA and ALPGEN, that
implement two different methods to match Matrix Element calculations and Parton
Shower. If we constraint them so that no more than one parton can emerge from
the Matrix Element calculations they should both give results similar to PYTHIA

reference to spot possible issues with the matching prescriptions implemented

studied 7 hot blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars (Teff<11500 K) in the GC NGC
6752 with the purpose to measure their Helium content. In addition
Fe,Cr,Si,Ti,O,Na, and Ba abundances were measured. We could measure He
abundance only for stars warmer than Teff=8500 K. All our targets with
measurable He are zero age HB (ZAHB) objects and turned out to have a
homogeneous He content with a mean value of Y=0.245+-0.012, compatible with the
most recent measurements of the primordial He content of the Universe (Y~0.25).
The whole sample of stars have a metallicity of [Fe/H]=-1.56+-0.03 and
[alpha/Fe]=+0.21+-0.03. Our HB targets show the same Na-O anticorrelation
identified among the TO-SGB-RGB stars. This is the first direct measurement of
the He abundance for a significative sample of GC stars in a temperature regime
where the He content is not altered by sedimentation processing or extreme
mixing as suggested for the hottest, late helium flasher HB stars.

significantly along with the near-IR polarization and flux density over the
course of 10 days in early 2006. Furthermore, the values of the electric vector
position angle (EVPA) at the three wavebands are similar. At 43 GHz, the EVPA
of the blazar core is perpendicular to the flow of the jet, while the EVPAs of
emerging superluminal knots are aligned parallel to the jet axis. The core
polarization is that expected if shear aligns the magnetic field at the
boundary between flows of disparate velocities within the jet. Using variations
in flux density, percentage polarization, and EVPA, we model the inner jet as a
spine-sheath system. The model jet contains a turbulent spine of half-width 1.2
degrees and maximum Lorentz factor of 16.5, a turbulent sheath with Lorentz
factor of 5, and a boundary region of sheared field between the spine and
sheath. Transverse shocks propagating along the fast, turbulent spine can
explain the superluminal knots. The observed flux density and polarization
variations are then compatible with changes in the direction of the inner jet
caused by a temporary change in the position of the core if the spine contains
wiggles owing to an instability. In addition, we can explain a stable offset of
optical and near-IR percentage polarization by a steepening of spectral index
with frequency, as supported by the data.

the sensitivity of the Planck satellite, over a range of angular scales.
However, the typical halo contribution is well below the cosmic variance noise

states with columnar ordering. For a family of these models we find a direct
thermal transition from the Coulomb phase to the dimer crystal. While some
systems exhibit (strong) first-order transitions in correspondence with the
Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm, we also find clear numerical evidence for
continuous transitions. A second family of models undergoes two consecutive

Coulomb phase from the dimer crystal. We can describe all of these phase
transitions in one unifying framework of candidate field theories with two

binary black holes that can be identified as sub-parsec luminous quasars.
To-date, only two candidates have been selected in a sample comprising 17,500
sources selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Quasar Catalog at
z<0.70 (Boroson & Lauer 2009) In this Letter, we use models of assembly and
growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in hierarchical cosmologies to study
the statistics and observability of binary quasars at sub-parsec separations.
Our goal is twofold: (1) test if such a scarce number of binaries is consistent
with theoretical prediction of SMBH merger rates, and (2) provide additional
predictions at higher redshifts, and at lower flux levels. We determine the
cumulative number of expected binaries in a complete, volume limited sample.
Motivated by Boroson & Lauer (2009), we apply the SDSS Quasar luminosity cut
(M_i<-22) to our theoretical sample, deriving an upper limit to the observable
binary fraction. We find that sub-parsec quasar binaries are intrinsically
rare. Our best models predict ~0.01 deg^-2 sub-parsec binary quasars with
separations below ~10^4 Schwarzschild radii (v_orb>2000 km/s) at z<0.7, which
represent a fraction ~6x10^-4 of unabsorbed quasars in our theoretical sample.
In a complete sample of ~10,000 sources, we therefore predict an upper limit of
~10 sub-parsec binary quasars. The number of binaries increases rapidly with
increasing redshift. The decreasing lifetime with SMBH binary mass suggests
that lowering the luminosity threshold does not lead to a significant increase
in the number of detectable sub-parsec binary quasars.

defined by low-redshift galaxies, but is offset by a factor of more than ten to
lower abundances. The amount of chemical and/or luminosity evolution required
to place these galaxies on the local L-Z relation is extreme, suggesting that
these galaxies are in a very special stage of their evolution. They may be
late-forming massive systems, which would challenge the current paradigm of
galaxy formation. Alternatively, they may represent intense starbursts in
dwarf-dwarf mergers or a major infall episode of pristine gas into a
pre-existing galaxy. In any case, these objects represent an extreme stage of
galaxy evolution taking place at relatively low redshift.

mass and their host galaxy properties such as total stellar mass, velocity
dispersion, and potential well depth. This has led to the development of
self-regulated models for BH growth, in which feedback from the central BH
halts its own growth upon reaching a critical threshold. However, models have
also been proposed in which feedback plays no role: so long as a fixed fraction
of the host gas supply is accreted, relations like those observed can be
reproduced. Here, we argue that the scatter in the observed BH-host
correlations, and its run with scale, presents a demanding constraint on any
model for these correlations, and that it favors self-regulated models of BH
growth. We show that the scatter in the stellar mass fraction within a radius R
in observed ellipticals and spheroids increases strongly at small R. At fixed
total stellar mass (or host velocity dispersion), on very small scales near the
BH radius of influence, there is an order-of-magnitude scatter in the amount of
gas that must have entered and formed stars. In short, the BH appears to 'know
more' about the global host galaxy potential on large scales than the stars and
gas supply on small scales. This is predicted in self-regulated models;
however, models where there is no feedback would generically predict
order-of-magnitude scatter in the BH-host correlations. Likewise, models in
which the BH feedback in the 'bright' mode does not regulate the growth of the
BH itself, but sets the stellar mass of the galaxy by inducing star formation
or blowing out a mass in gas much larger than the galaxy stellar mass, are
difficult to reconcile with the scatter on small scales.

the Nobeyama and BIMA surveys to demonstrate that, contrary to common belief, a
significant number (~40%) of HI-deficient nearby spiral galaxies are also
depleted in molecular hydrogen. While HI-deficiency by itself is not a
sufficient condition for molecular gas depletion, we find that H2 reduction is
associated with the removal of HI inside the galaxy optical disk. Those
HI-deficient galaxies with normal H2 content have lost HI mainly from outside
their optical disks, where the H2 content is low in all galaxies. This finding
is consistent with theoretical models in which the molecular fraction in a
galaxy is determined primarily by its gas column density. Our result is
supported by indirect evidence that molecular deficient galaxies form stars at
a lower rate or have dimmer far infrared fluxes than gas rich galaxies, as
expected if the star formation rate is determined by the molecular hydrogen
content. Our result is consistent with a scenario in which, when the atomic gas
column density is lowered inside the optical disk below the critical value
required to form molecular hydrogen and stars, spirals become quiescent and
passive evolving systems. We speculate that this process would act on the
time-scale set by the gas depletion rate and might be a first step for the
transition between the blue and red sequence observed in the color-magnitude

embedded in larger structures in the redshift range 0.4-2.5. From the analysis
of their physical properties (mass profile, M200, \sigmav, LX, U-B vs. B

poor clusters with masses of few times 10^14 Mo. For these two clusters we
find, from the Chandra 2Ms data, an X-ray emission significantly lower than
expected from their optical properties, suggesting that the two clusters are
either not virialised or gas poor. We also analyse the dependance on
environment of galaxy colours, luminosities, stellar masses, ages and star
formations. We find that galaxies in high density regions are, on average, more
luminous and massive than field galaxies up to z\sim 2. The fraction of red
galaxies increases with luminosity and with density up to z\sim 1.2. At higher
z this dependance on density disappears. The variation of galaxy properties as
a function of redshift and density suggests that a significant change occurs at

are shown to reduce energy gaps compared to the hydrogenated nanocrystals,
consistent with previous results in the literature. This trend is shown to be
reversed when planar interfaces are formed in Si-NC inside SiO2 thin films, as
in Si quantum wells. At planar interfaces (or surfaces) the electronic charge
density is shown to become extended and to distribute among the Si-suboxides,
thus generating along these planar interfaces extended, or delocalized, states.
This delocalization of the electronic states then increase the energy gap
compared to equivalent hydrogenated interfaces (or surfaces). Determination of
geometric effects of curvature on the band gaps are based on density functional
theory (DFT) using the real-space numerical approach implemented in the

show analytically that positive Lyapunov exponents are generated due to double

changes smoothly with $\gamma$, the number of occurrences of the most probable

particular, the influence of the integrable and pseudointegrable dynamics

found that the distant relation is systematically offset by roughly a factor of
two toward lower masses. We extend the study of the evolution of the TFR by
establishing the first distant baryonic TFR. To derive gas masses in distant
galaxies, we estimate a gas radius and invert the Schmidt-Kennicutt law between
star formation rate and gas surface densities. We find that gas extends farther
out than the UV light from young stars, a median of ~30%. We present the first
baryonic TFR (bTFR) ever established at intermediate redshift and show that,
within an uncertainty of +/-0.08 dex, the zeropoint of the bTFR does not appear
to evolve between z~0.6 and z=0. The absence of evolution in the bTFR over the
past 6 Gyr implies that no external gas accretion is required for distant
rotating disks to sustain star formation until z=0 and convert most of their
gas into stars. Finally, we confirm that the larger scatter found in the
distant smTFR, and hence in the bTFR, is caused entirely by major mergers. This
scatter results from a transfer of energy from bulk motions in the progenitors,
to random motions in the remnants, generated by shocks during the merging.
Shocks occurring during these events naturally explain the large extent of
ionized gas found out to the UV radius in z~0.6 galaxies. All the results
presented in this paper support the ``spiral rebuilding scenario'' of Hammer

morphologies are dominated by young stars and are related to their ionised-gas

using gas modelling from Barnes' (2002) study of major mergers. Using our
modelling to estimate the gas-to-stars transformation during a merger, we
identify the gas fraction in the progenitors to be generally above 50%. All
distant and massive starbursts can be distributed along a temporal sequence
from the first passage to the nuclei fusion and then to the disk rebuilding
phase. It confirms that the rebuilding spiral disk scenario is possibly an
important channel for the formation of present-day disks in spirals. Because
half of the present-day spirals had peculiar morphologies and anomalous
kinematics at zmed=0.65, they could indeed be in major mergers phases 6 Gyrs

0405-123 (z_em = 0.5726) obtained with FUSE and STIS. In addition to strong O
VI, with log N(O VI) = 14.47+/-0.02, and moderate H I this absorber shows C
III, N IV, O IV, and O V, with upper limits for another seven ions. The large
number of available ions allows us to test ionization models usually adopted
with far less contraints. We find the ionic column densities cannot be matched
by collisional ionization models, in or out of equilibrium. Photoionization
models can match the observed column densities, including O VI. If one assumes
photoionization by a UV background dominated by QSOs, the metallicity of the
gas is [O/H] = -0.15, while a model for the UV background with contributions
from ionizing photons escaping from galaxies gives [O/H] = -0.62. Both give
[N/O] ~ -0.6 and [C/H] ~ -0.2 to -0.1. The choice of ionizing spectrum is
poorly constrained. Multiphase models with a contribution from both
photoionized gas (at T~10^4 K) and collisionally ionized gas (at T~(1-3)x10^5
K) can also match the observations giving very similar metallicities. The O VI
in this system is not necessarily a reliable tracer of WHIM matter. We do not
detect Ne VIII or Mg X absorption. The limit on Ne VIII/O VI < 0.21 (3 sigma),
the lowest yet observed. Thus this absorber shows no firm evidence of the
""warm-hot intergalactic medium"" at T~(0.5-3)x10^6 K thought to contain a
significant fraction of the baryons at low redshift. We present limits on the
total column of warm-hot gas in this absorber as a function of temperature.
This system would be unlikely to provide detectable X-ray absorption in the
ions O VII or O VIII even if it resided in front of the brighter X-ray sources
in the sky.

galaxies have smaller half-light radii re and larger velocity dispersions sigma
than younger ones of the same stellar mass Mstar. We use the age-corrected
luminosity Lcorr as a proxy for Mstar to minimize biases: below Lcorr~1e11
Lsun, galaxies with age ~11 Gyrs have re smaller by 40% and sigma larger by
25%, compared to galaxies that are ~4 Gyrs younger. The sizes and velocity
dispersions of more luminous galaxies vary by less than 15%, whatever their
age, a challenge for current galaxy formation models. A closer check reveals
that the lowering in the dispersion is caused by older galaxies that show a
significant departure from the re--Lcorr and sigma--Lcorr relations at high
Lcorr. Such features might find an explanation in models where more massive
galaxies undergo more minor mergers than less massive galaxies at late times,
thus causing a break in the homology. In terms of the Fundamental Plane of
early-type galaxies, the data indicate that all galaxies show a significant and
similar increase in the dynamical-to-stellar mass ratio with increasing mass,
independent of their age. However, older galaxies have smaller Mdyn/Mstar
ratios than objects which formed more recently. These findings may suggest that
lower mass galaxies and, at fixed stellar mass, higher redshift galaxies,
formed from gas-richer progenitors, thus underwent more dissipation and
contraction.

Simultaneously, we collected ground-based Johnson B observations on 16 nights
at the South African Astronomical Observatory. In addition to the dominant
oscillation mode at 2442 microHz, we detect two new modes that lie
symmetrically around the principal mode to form a triplet. The average
separation between these modes is 30.173+-0.004 microHz and they are nearly
equidistant with the separations differing by only 3.9 nHz. We compare the
observed frequencies with theoretical pulsation models based on constraints
from the recently determined interferometric radius and effective temperature,
and the recently updated Hipparcos parallax. We show that the theoretical large
separations for models of alpha Cir with global parameters within the 1-sigma
observational uncertainties vary between 59 and 65 microHz. This is consistent
with the large separation being twice the observed value, indicating that the
three main modes are of alternating even and odd degrees. The frequency
differences in the triplet are significantly smaller than those predicted from
our models, for all possible combinations of mode degrees, and may indicate
that the effects of magnetic perturbations need to be taken into account. The
WIRE light curves are modulated by a double wave with a period of 4.479 days,
and a peak-to-peak amplitude of 4 mmag. This variation is due to the rotation
of the star and is a new discovery, made possible by the high precision of the
WIRE photometry. The rotational modulation confirms an earlier indirect
determination of the rotation period.

ribbons manifests the successive reconnection that takes place higher up in the
corona. Meanwhile, downward traveling energetic electrons bombard the dense
chromosphere and create hard X-ray (HXR) emissions, which provide a valuable
diagnostic of electron acceleration. Analyses of ribbon dynamics and HXR
spectrum have been carried out separately. In this Letter, we report a study of
the comparison of reconnection electric field measured from ribbon motion and
hardness (spectral index) of X-ray emission derived from X-ray spectrum. Our
survey of the maximum average reconnection electric field and the minimum
overall spectral index for 13 two-ribbon flares show that they are strongly
anti-correlated. The former is also strongly correlated with flare magnitude
measured using the peak flux of soft X-ray emissions. These provide strong
support for electron acceleration models based on the electric field generated

survey, the K20 survey, and the GDDS. The shape of the UV extinction curve is
constrained by a parametric description of the rest-frame UV continuum. The UV
bump is further characterised by fitting Lorentzian-like profiles. Spectra
exhibit a significant 2175A feature in at least 30% of the cases. If
attenuation is dominated by dust ejected from the galaxy main body via
superwinds, UV extinction curves in-between those of the SMC and LMC
characterise the sample galaxies. The fraction of galaxies with extinction
curves differing from the SMC one increases, if more dust resides in the
galactic plane or dust attenuation depends on stellar age. On average, the
width of the manifested UV bumps is about 60% of the values typical of the LMC
and Milky Way. This suggests the presence of dust similar to that found in the
LMC2 supershell close to 30Dor. The presence of the carriers of the UV bump at
1<z<2.5 argues for outflows from AGB stars being copious then. Consistent with
their higher SFRs, the GMASS galaxies with a manifested UV bump are more
luminous at rest-frame 8mum, where the emission is dominated by PAHs (also
products of AGB stars). In addition, they exhibit stronger UV absorption
features, mostly of interstellar origin, which indicates overall more evolved
stellar populations. We conclude that diversification of the small-size dust
component has already started in the most evolved star-forming systems at
1<z<2.5.

liquid dynamics, the transit contribution to entropy was taken to be a
universal constant, calibrated to the constant-volume entropy of melting. This
model suffers two deficiencies: (a) it does not account for experimental
entropy differences of 2% among elemental liquids, and (b) it implies a value
of zero for the transit contribution to internal energy. The purpose of this
paper is to correct these deficiencies. To this end, the V-T equation for
entropy is fitted to an overall accuracy of 0.1% to the available experimental
high temperature entropy data for elemental liquids. The theory contains two
nuclear motion contributions: (a) the dominant vibrational contribution
S_{vib}(T/\theta_0), where T is temperature and \theta_0 is the vibrational
characteristic temperature, and (b) the transit contribution
S_{tr}(T/\theta_{tr}), where \theta_{tr} is a scaling temperature for each
liquid. The appearance of a common functional form of S_{tr} for all the
liquids studied is a property of the experimental data, when analyzed via the
V-T formula. The resulting S_{tr} implies the correct transit contribution to
internal energy. The theoretical entropy of melting is derived, in a single
formula applying to normal and anomalous melting alike. An ab initio
calculation of \theta_0, based on density functional theory, is reported for
liquid Na and Cu. Comparison of these calculations with the above analysis of
experimental entropy data provides verification of V-T theory. In view of the
present results, techniques currently being applied in ab initio simulations of
liquid properties can be employed to advantage in the further testing and
development of V-T theory.

predict. We address this discrepancy by reexamining the superburst trigger
mechanism. We first explore the hypothesis of Kuulkers et al. that exothermic
electron captures trigger superbursts. We find that all electron capture
reactions are thermally stable in accreting neutron star oceans and thus are
not a viable trigger mechanism. Fusion reactions other than 12C + 12C are
infeasible as well since the possible reactants either deplete at much
shallower depths or have prohibitively large Coulomb barriers. Thus we confirm
the proposal of Cumming & Bildsten and Strohmayer & Brown that 12C + 12C
triggers superbursts. We then examine the 12C + 12C fusion rate. The reaction
cross-section is experimentally unknown at astrophysically relevant energies,
but resonances exist in the 12C + 12C system throughout the entire measured
energy range. Thus it is likely, and in fact has been predicted, that a
resonance exists near the Gamow peak energy ~ 1.5 MeV. For such a hypothetical
1.5 MeV resonance, we derive both a fiducial value and upper limit to the
resonance strength and find that such a resonance could decrease the
theoretically predicted superburst ignition depth by up to a factor of 4; in
this case, observationally inferred superburst ignition depths would accord
with model predictions for a range of plausible neutron star parameters. Said
differently, such a resonance would decrease the temperature required for
unstable 12C ignition at a column depth 10^12 g/cm^2 from 6 x 10^8 K to 5 x
10^8 K. Determining the existence of a strong resonance in the Gamow window
requires measurements of the 12C + 12C cross-section down to a center-of-mass
energy near 1.5 MeV, which is within reach of the proposed DUSEL facility.

element methods for a displacement-pressure model modeling swelling dynamics of
polymer gels under mechanical constraints. In the model, the swelling dynamics
is governed by the solvent permeation and the elastic interaction; the
permeation is described by a pressure equation for the solvent, and the elastic
interaction is described by displacement equations for the solid network of the
gel. By introducing an ""elastic pressure"" we first present a reformulation of
the original model, and then propose a time-stepping scheme which decouples the
PDE system at each time step into two sub-problems, one of which is a
generalized Stokes problem for the displacement vector field and another is a
diffusion problem for a ""pseudo-pressure"" field. To make such a multiphysical
approach feasible, it is vital to discover admissible constraints to resolve
the uniqueness issue for both sub-problems. The main advantage of the proposed
approach is that it allows one to utilize any convergent Stokes solver together
with any convergent diffusion equation solver to solve the polymer gel model.
In the paper, the Taylor-Hood mixed finite element method combined with the
continuous linear finite element method are used as an example to present the
ideas and to demonstrate the viability of the proposed multiphysical approach.
It is proved that, under a mesh constraint, both the proposed semi-discrete (in
space) and fully discrete methods enjoy some discrete energy laws which mimic
the differential energy law satisfied by the PDE solution. Optimal order error
estimates in various norms are established for the numerical solutions of both
the semi-discrete and fully discrete methods. Numerical experiments are also
presented to show the efficiency of the proposed approach and methods.

our limits to the SM predictions. With 2.0-3.6 fb-1 of data analyzed at CDF,
and 0.9-4.2 fb-1 at D0, the 95% C.L. upper limits on Higgs boson production are
a factor of 2.5 (0.86) times the SM cross section for a Higgs boson mass of
m_H=115 (165) GeV/c^2. Based on simulation, the corresponding median expected
upper limits are 2.4 (1.1). The mass range excluded at 95% C.L. for a SM Higgs

understanding of the Galaxy by ""observing"" particle realizations of
non-axisymmetric disk distributions orbiting in an axisymmetric halo with
appropriate errors and then attempting to recover the underlying potential
using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. We demonstrate that the
azimuthally averaged gravitational force field in the Galactic plane--and
hence, to a lesser extent, the Galactic mass distribution--can be tightly
constrained over a large range of radii using a variety of types of surveys so
long as the error distribution of the measurements of the parallax, proper
motion and radial velocity are well-understood and the disk is surveyed
globally. One advantage of our method is that the target stars can be selected
non-randomly in real or apparent-magnitude space to ensure just such a global
sample without biasing the results. Assuming we can always measure the
line-of-sight velocity of a star with at least 1 km/s precision, we demonstrate
that the force field can be determined to better than ~1% for Galactocentric
radii in the range R=4-20 kpc We conclude that near-future surveys, like SIM
Lite, Gaia, and VERA, will provide the first precise mapping of the
gravitational force field in the region of the Galactic disk.

revealed, in agreement with calculations, a large difference in the EFG for

performed density functional electronic structure calculations within the

that the EFG increases upon lattice expansion. Applying the standard model for
perovskites, the effective two-level p-d Hamiltonian, can not explain the
observed behavior. In order to describe the EFG dependence correctly, a model
beyond this usually sufficient p-d Hamiltonian is needed. We demonstrate that
the counter-intuitive increase of the EFG upon lattice expansion can be
explained by a s-p-d model, containing the contribution of the oxygen 2s states
to the crystal field on the Ti site. The proposed model extension is of general
relevance for all related transition metal oxides with similar crystal

This is the largest sample of SMGs observed with Spitzer IRS and covers the
full extent of properties of the radio-identified population of SMGs in the
redshift range of z ~ 0.65-3.2. We observe broad emission features from
Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in more than 80% of our sample. We find
that the median mid-IR spectrum is well described by a starburst component with
an additional power law, Fnu ~ nu^-2, likely representing a < 32% AGN
contribution to the bolometric luminosity. Our results thus confirm that
starburst activity dominates the bolometric luminosity in SMGs. We find that
SMGs show weaker silicate absorption at 9.7um than local ULIRGs. We also find
stronger 6.2um PAH emission in SMGs (relative to the 7.7um PAH feature) than in
local nuclear starbursts, which may be attributed to lower extinction by ice
along the line of sight to SMGs. This suggests that the continuum and PAH
emitting regions of SMGs are less obscured than in local starbursts and
similarly luminous low-redshift ULIRGs. We interpret these results as evidence
for a more extended distribution of cool and warm dust in SMGs compared to the
more compact emitting regions in local ULIRGs and starbursts. Together these
results suggest that SMGs are not simple high-redshift analogs of local ULIRGs
or nuclear starbursts, but instead they appear to have star formation which
resembles that seen in less-extreme star-forming environments at z~0 --
suggesting their intense activity is distributed across a far larger region
than the ~1-kpc nuclear bursts in local ULIRGs.

the data during the period before the year 1996 may be artifacts of the

most of the activity phenomena during cycles 22 (1986-1996) and 23 (after 1997)

exchange-correlation energy of a nonmolecular solid, by applying accurate
calculations with the GAUSSIAN, BAND, and VASP codes to a test set of 24 solid
metals and non-metals. The functionals tested are the modified
Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (PBEsol GGA), the
second-order GGA (SOGGA), and the Armiento-Mattsson 2005 (AM05) GGA. For
completeness, we also test more-standard functionals: the local density
approximation, the original PBE GGA, and the Tao-Perdew-Staroverov-Scuseria
(TPSS) meta-GGA. We find that the recent density functionals for solids reach a
high accuracy for bulk properties (lattice constant and bulk modulus). For the
cohesive energy, PBE is better than PBEsol overall, as expected, but PBEsol is
actually better for the alkali metals and alkali halides. For fair comparison
of calculated and experimental results, we consider the zero-point phonon and
finite-temperature effects ignored by many workers. We show how Gaussian basis
sets and inaccurate experimental reference data may affect the rating of the
quality of the functionals. The results show that PBEsol and AM05 perform
somewhat differently from each other for alkali metal, alkaline earth metal and
alkali halide crystals (where the maximum value of the reduced density gradient
is about 2), but perform very similarly for most of the other solids (where it
is often about 1). Our explanation for this is consistent with the importance
of exchange-correlation nonlocality in regions of core-valence overlap.

the scenario that conformal dynamics causes approximate R-symmetry and

between both populations.
  We have obtained high-resolution imaging in the optical for a sample of 24

  We are sensitive to companions at separations larger than 0.1 arcsec and
differences of ~2 magnitudes at 0.1 arcsec and ~5 mag at 1 arcsec. We have
found no companion around the 24 subdwarfs under study and one close binary out
of nine extreme subdwarfs. A second image of LHS 182 taken three months later
with the same instrument confirms the common proper motion of the binary
separated by about 0.7 arcsec. Moreover, we do not confirm the common proper
motion of the faint source reported by Riaz and collaborators at ~2 arcsec from
LHS 1074. We derive a binary frequency of 3+/-3% for M subdwarfs from our
sample of 33 objects for separations larger than about five astronomical units.
Adding to our sample the additional 28 metal-poor early-M dwarfs observed with
the Hubble Space Telescope by Riaz and collaborators, we infer a binary
fraction of 3.7+/-2.6% (with a 1 sigma confidence limit), significantly lower

expansion of the Universe, and about the `weak singularity' are clarified: 1.
Of the five definitions of the deceleration parameter given by Hirata and
Seljak (HS), only $q_1$ is a correct invariant measure of
acceleration/deceleration of expansion. The $q_3$ and $q_4$ are unrelated to
acceleration in an inhomogeneous model. 2. The averaging over directions
involved in the definition of $q_4$ does not correspond to what is done in
observational astronomy. 3. HS's equation (38) connecting $q_4$ to the flow
invariants gives self-contradictory results when applied at the centre of
symmetry of the Lema\^{\i}tre-Tolman (L-T) model. The intermediate equation
(31) that determines $q_{3'}$ is correct, but approximate, so it cannot be used
for determining the sign of the deceleration parameter. Even so, at the centre
of symmetry of the L-T model, it puts no limitation on the sign of $q_{3'}(0)$.
4. The `weak singularity' of Vanderveld {\it et al.} is a conical profile of
mass density at the centre - a perfectly acceptable configuration. 5. The
so-called `critical point' in the equations of the `inverse problem' for a
central observer in an L-T model is a manifestation of the apparent horizon - a
common property of the past light cones in zero-lambda L-T models, perfectly
manageable if the equations are correctly integrated.

far, the aeronautical sector hasn't been focusing much on managing chemical
risks at the design stage. However, new substances regulations notably require
that chemical risk management should be by industries used as early as possible
in their product development process. The aeronautics sector has therefore to
elaborate new chemical risk management. The aim of this paper is to present a
new method hat should be adapted to aeronautical designers' practices and based
on simple entry data, but efficient enough to ensure a good substances
traceability all along the product design process. The method second objective
is also to guide the designer's materials and process choices by avoiding the
most chemically critical ones. The proposed method has been elaborated by an
industrial dedicated team and is based on four main steps. The structure, the
related tools and the parameters of the method have been chosen and developed
in order to be easily understood by non environmental experts, and directly
operational. The method is tested on a case study.

indicates that the search takes place through a few specific nodes. We define
the funnelling capacity $f$ of a node as the fraction of successful dynamic
paths through it with a fixed target. The distribution $D(f)$ of the fraction
of nodes with funnelling capacity $f$ shows a power law behaviour in random
networks (with power law or stretched exponential degree distribution) for a
considerable range of values of the parameters defining the networks.
Specifically we study in detail $D_1=D(f=1)$, which is the quantity signifying
the presence of nodes through which all the dynamical paths pass through. In
scale free networks with degree distribution $P(k) \propto k^{-\gamma}$, $D_1$
increases linearly with $\gamma$ initially and then attains a constant value.
It shows a power law behaviour, $D_1 \propto N^{-\rho}$, with the number of
nodes $N$ where $\rho$ is weakly dependent on $\gamma$ for $\gamma > 2.2$. The
latter variation is also independent of the number of searches. On stretched
exponential networks with $P(k) \propto \exp{(-k^\delta)}$, $\rho$ is strongly
dependent on $\delta$. The funnelling distribution for a model social network,
where the question of funnelling is most relevant, is also investigated.

strongly anisotropic, especially at lower densities and lower values of the
coefficient of restitution, with the largest variance in the direction of
shear. The density dependence of the compressibility factor of the sheared
inelastic hard sphere system is quite similar to that of elastic hard sphere
fluids. As the systems become more inelastic, the glancing collisions begin to

and the surface density of the ISM (the local Kennicutt-Schmitt law) using a
simplified model of the ISM and a simple estimate of the star formation rate
based on the mass of gas in bound clumps, the local dynamical timescales of the
clumps, and an efficiency parameter of around 5 per cent. Despite the
simplicity of the approach, we are able to reproduce the observed linear
relation between star formation rate and surface density of dense (molecular)
gas. We use a simple model for the dependence of H_2 fraction on total surface
density to argue why neither total surface density nor the HI surface density
are good local indicators of star formation rate. We also investigate the
dependence of the star formation rate on the depth of the spiral potential. Our
model indicates that the mean star formation rate does not depend significantly
on the strength of the spiral potential, but that a stronger spiral potential,
for a given mean surface density, does result in more of the star formation
occurring close to the spiral arms. This agrees with the observation that grand
design galaxies do not appear to show a larger degree of star formation
compared to their flocculent counterparts.

case the phase interface (bubble wall) can become ultra-relativistic, with the
relativistic gamma factor gamma = (1-v_{wall}^2)^{-1/2} growing linearly with

  Stream Processing Platform","17 pages, submitted to Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing",,,,"cs.DC cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents resource management techniques for allocating
communication and computational resources in a distributed stream processing
platform. The platform is designed to exploit the synergy of two classes of
network connections -- dedicated and opportunistic. Previous studies we
conducted have demonstrated the benefits of such bi-modal resource organization
that combines small pools of dedicated computers with a very large pool of
opportunistic computing capacities of idle computers to serve high throughput
computing applications. This paper extends the idea of bi-modal resource
organization into the management of communication resources. Since distributed
stream processing applications demand large volume of data transmission between
processing sites at a consistent rate, adequate control over the network
resources is important to assure a steady flow of processing. The system model
used in this paper is a platform where stream processing servers at distributed
sites are interconnected with a combination of dedicated and opportunistic
communication links. Two pertinent resource allocation problems are analyzed in
details and solved using decentralized algorithms. One is the mapping of the
stream processing tasks on the processing and the communication resources. The
other is the adaptive re-allocation of the opportunistic communication links
due to the variations in their capacities. Overall optimization goal is higher
task throughput and better utilization of the expensive dedicated links. The
evaluation demonstrates that the algorithms are able to exploit the synergy of
bi-modal communication links towards achieving the optimization goals.

recently been focused on stack computation, and in particular calls for a
formulation of information-lossless stack or pushdown compressors that allows a
formal analysis of their performance and a more ambitious use of the stack in
XML compression, where so far it is mainly connected to parsing mechanisms. In
this paper we introduce the model of pushdown compressor, based on pushdown
transducers that compute a single injective function while keeping the widest
generality regarding stack computation.
  We also consider online compression algorithms that use at most
polylogarithmic space (plogon). These algorithms correspond to compressors in
the data stream model.
  We compare the performance of these two families of compressors with each
other and with the general purpose Lempel-Ziv algorithm. This comparison is
made without any a priori assumption on the data's source and considering the
asymptotic compression ratio for infinite sequences. We prove that in all cases
they are incomparable.

waves in a rotating fluid body. The intentionally simplified model involves a
perfectly rigid core surrounded by a deep ocean consisting of a homogeneous
incompressible fluid. Centrifugal effects are neglected, but the Coriolis force
is considered in full, and dissipation occurs through viscous or frictional
forces. The dissipation rate exhibits a complicated dependence on the tidal
frequency and generally increases with the size of the core. In certain
intervals of frequency, efficient dissipation is found to occur even for very
small values of the coefficient of viscosity or friction. We discuss the
results with reference to wave attractors, critical latitudes and other
features of the propagation of inertial waves within the fluid, and comment on
their relevance for tidal dissipation in planets and stars.

employing random phase approximation (RPA) response functions and found that
the observed discrepancy is partly resolved by the pionic and rho-mesonic

observed properties of umbral dots are well reproduced by realistic simulations
of magnetoconvection in a vertical, monolithic magnetic field. To understand
the penumbra, it is useful to distinguish between the inner penumbra, dominated
by bright filaments containing slender dark cores, and the outer penumbra, made
up of dark and bright filaments of comparable width with corresponding magnetic
fields differing in inclination by some 30 degrees and strong Evershed flows in
the dark filaments along nearly horizontal or downward-plunging magnetic
fields. The role of magnetic flux pumping in submerging magnetic flux in the
outer penumbra is examined through numerical experiments, and different
geometric models of the penumbral magnetic field are discussed in the light of
high-resolution observations. Recent, realistic numerical MHD simulations of an
entire sunspot have succeeded in reproducing the salient features of the
convective pattern in the umbra and the inner penumbra. The siphon-flow
mechanism still provides the best explanation of the Evershed flow,
particularly in the outer penumbra where it often consists of cool, supersonic
downflows.

conformal field theory determine the affine symmetry of the theory uniquely,
and we give arguments that suggest that also the representation content with
respect to this affine symmetry is specified, up to automorphisms of the finite
Lie algebra. We illustrate our findings with the self-dual theories at c=16 and
c=24; in particular, we give an elementary argument that shows that the vacuum
amplitudes of the E_8\times E_8 theory and the Spin(32)/Z_2 theory differ at
genus g=5. The fact that the discrepancy only arises at rather high genus is a
consequence of the modular properties of higher genus amplitudes at small
central charges. In fact, we show that for c\leq 24 the genus one partition
function specifies already the partition functions up to g\leq 4 uniquely.
Finally we explain how our results generalise to non-meromorphic conformal
field theories.
