is still a major issue to understand galaxy formation and evolution at early
epochs in the history of the Universe. Aims. This work aims to provide a first
insight into the dynamics and mass assembly of galaxies at redshifts 1.2<z<1.6,
the early epoch just before the sharp decrease of the cosmic star formation
rate. Methods. We use the near-infrared integral field spectrograph SINFONI on
the ESO-VLT under 0.65 seeing to obtain spatially resolved spectroscopy on nine
emission line galaxies with 1.2<z<1.6 from the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey. We derive
the velocity fields and velocity dispersions on kpc scales using the Halpha
emission line. Results. Out of the nine star-forming galaxies, we find that
galaxies distribute in three groups: two galaxies can be well reproduced by a
rotating disk, three systems can be classified as major mergers and four
galaxies show disturbed dynamics and high velocity dispersion. We argue that
there is evidence for hierarchical mass assembly from major merger, with most
massive galaxies with M>10^11Msun subject to at least one major merger over a 3
Gyr period as well as for continuous accretion feeding strong star formation.
Conclusions. These results point towards a galaxy formation and assembly
scenario which involves several processes, possibly acting in parallel, with
major mergers and continuous gas accretion playing a major role. Well
controlled samples representative of the bulk of the galaxy population at this
key cosmic time are necessary to make further progress.

provided by excursion set theory, where density perturbations evolve
stochastically with the smoothing scale, and the problem of computing the
probability of halo formation is mapped into the so-called first-passage time
problem in the presence of a barrier. While the full dynamical complexity of
halo formation can only be revealed through N-body simulations, excursion set
theory provides a simple analytic framework for understanding various aspects
of this complex process. In this series of paper we propose improvements of
both technical and conceptual aspects of excursion set theory, and we explore
up to which point the method can reproduce quantitatively the data from N-body
simulations. In paper I of the series we show how to derive excursion set
theory from a path integral formulation. This allows us both to derive
rigorously the absorbing barrier boundary condition, that in the usual
formulation is just postulated, and to deal analytically with the non-markovian
nature of the random walk. Such a non-markovian dynamics inevitably enters when
either the density is smoothed with filters such as the top-hat filter in
coordinate space (which is the only filter associated to a well defined halo
mass) or when one considers non-Gaussian fluctuations. In these cases, beside
``markovian'' terms, we find ``memory'' terms that reflect the non-markovianity
of the evolution with the smoothing scale. We develop a general formalism for
evaluating perturbatively these non-markovian corrections, and in this paper we
perform explicitly the computation of the halo mass function for gaussian
fluctuations, to first order in the non-markovian corrections due to the use of
a tophat filter in coordinate space.

framework, at least at an effective level, by taking into account that the
critical value for collapse is not a fixed constant $\delta_c$, as in the
spherical collapse model, nor a fixed function of the variance $\sigma$ of the
smoothed density field, as in the ellipsoidal collapse model, but rather is
itself a stochastic variable, whose scatter reflects a number of complicated
aspects of the underlying dynamics. Solving the first-passage time problem in
the presence of a diffusing barrier we find that the exponential factor in the
Press-Schechter mass function changes from $\exp\{-\delta_c^2/2\sigma^2\}$ to
$\exp\{-a\delta_c^2/2\sigma^2\}$, where $a=1/(1+D_B)$ and $D_B$ is the
diffusion coefficient of the barrier. The numerical value of $D_B$, and
therefore the corresponding value of $a$, depends among other things on the
algorithm used for identifying halos. We discuss the physical origin of the
stochasticity of the barrier and we compare with the mass function found in
N-body simulations, for the same halo definition.[Abridged]

stochastic evolution of the smoothed density field, as a function of the
smoothing scale, is non-markovian and beside ""local"" terms that generalize
Press-Schechter (PS) theory, there are also ""memory"" terms, whose effect on the
mass function can be computed using the formalism developed in the first paper
of this series. We find that, when computing the effect of the three-point
correlator on the mass function, a PS-like approach which consists in
neglecting the cloud-in-cloud problem and in multiplying the final result by a
fudge factor close to 2, is in principle not justified. When computed correctly
in the framework of excursion set theory, in fact, the ""local"" contribution
vanishes (for all odd-point correlators the contribution of the image gaussian
cancels the Press-Schechter contribution rather than adding up), and the result
comes entirely from non-trivial memory terms which are absent in PS theory.
However it turns out that, in the limit of large halo masses, where the effect
of non-Gaussianity is more relevant, these memory terms give a contribution
which is the the same as that computed naively with PS theory, plus subleading
terms depending on derivatives of the three-point correlator. We finally
combine these results with the diffusive barrier model developed in the second
paper of this series, and we find that the resulting mass function reproduces
recent N-body simulations with non-Gaussian initial conditions, without the
introduction of any ad hoc parameter.

well-defined network of initial configurations for which density functional

universe corresponding to [Fe/H]<-1.5. If Type II supernovae (SNe II) are the
only relevant sources, then the abundances in the interstellar medium of the
juvenile epoch are simply the sum of different SN II contributions. Both
low-mass (~8-11M_sun) and normal (~12-25M_sun) SNe II produce neutron stars,
which have intense neutrino-driven winds in their nascent stages. These winds
produce elements such as Sr, Y, and Zr through charged-particle reactions
(CPR). Such elements are often called the light r-process elements, but are
considered here as products of CPR and not the r-process. The observed absence
of production of the low-A elements (Na through Zn including Fe) when the true
r-process elements (Ba and above) are produced requires that only low-mass SNe
II be the site if the r-process occurs in SNe II. Normal SNe II produce the CPR
elements in addition to the low-A elements. This results in a two-component
model that is quantitatively successful in explaining the abundances of all
elements relative to hydrogen for -3<[Fe/H]<-1.5. This model explicitly
predicts that [Sr/Fe]>-0.32. Recent observations show that there are stars with
[Sr/Fe]<-2 and [Fe/H]<-3. This proves that the two-component model is not
correct and that a third component is necessary to explain the observations.
This leads to a simple three-component model including low-mass and normal SNe
II and hypernovae (HNe), which gives a good description of essentially all the
data for stars with [Fe/H]<-1.5. We conclude that HNe are more important than
normal SNe II in the chemical evolution of the low-A elements, in sharp

same temperature range (below 200 mK) where mass decoupling and supersolidity
have been inferred from torsional oscillator measurements. The two phenomena
are clearly related and crystal defects, particularly dislocations, appear to
be involved in both. We have studied the effects of annealing and the effects
of applying large stresses on the elastic properties of solid 4He, using both
acoustic resonances and direct low-frequency and low-amplitude measurements of
the shear modulus. Both annealing and stressing affect the shear modulus, as
expected if dislocations are responsible. However, it is the high temperature
modulus which is affected; the low temperature behavior is unchanged and
appears to reflect the intrinsic modulus of solid helium. We interpret this
behavior in terms of dislocations which are pinned by isotopic 3He impurities
at low temperatures and so have no effect on the shear modulus. At higher
temperatures they become mobile and weaken the solid. Stressing the crystal at
low temperatures appears to introduce new defects or additional pinning sites
for the dislocation network but these effects can be reversed by heating the
crystal above 500 mK. This is in contrast to dislocations produced during
crystal growth, which are only annealed at temperatures close to melting.

decade, this has moved from an archeological question to a live investigation:
there is now a broad picture of the evolution of galaxies in dark matter halos:
their masses, stars, metals and supermassive blackholes. Galaxies have been
found and studied in which these formation processes are taking place most
vigorously, all the way back in cosmic time to when the intergalactic medium
(IGM) was still largely neutral. However, the details of how and why the
interstellar medium (ISM) in distant galaxies cools, is processed, recycled and
enriched in metals by stars, and fuels active galactic nuclei (AGNs) remain
uncertain. In particular, the cooling of gas to fuel star formation, and the
chemistry and physics of the most intensely active regions is hidden from view
at optical wavelengths, but can be seen and diagnosed at mid- & far-infrared
(IR) wavelengths. Rest-frame IR observations are important first to identify
the most luminous, interesting and important galaxies, secondly to quantify
accurately their total luminosity, and finally to use spectroscopy to trace the
conditions in the molecular and atomic gas out of which stars form. In order to
map out these processes over the full range of environments and large-scale
structures found in the universe - from the densest clusters of galaxies to the
emptiest voids - we require tools for deep, large area surveys, of millions of
galaxies out to z~5, and for detailed follow-up spectroscopy. The necessary
tools can be realized technically. Here, we outline the requirements for
gathering the crucial information to build, validate and challenge models of
galaxy evolution.

Gaussian case, these models are directly related to the sparsity of the inverse

with lower computational complexity. We consider concentration estimation with
the mean-squared error (MSE) as the objective, in a special type of model known
as decomposable. This model includes, for example, the well known banded
structure and other cases encountered in practice. Our first contribution is
the derivation and analysis of the minimum variance unbiased estimator (MVUE)
in decomposable graphical models. We provide a simple closed form solution to
the MVUE and compare it with the classical maximum likelihood estimator (MLE)
in terms of performance and complexity. Next, we extend the celebrated Stein's
unbiased risk estimate (SURE) to graphical models. Using SURE, we prove that
the MSE of the MVUE is always smaller or equal to that of the biased MLE, and
that the MVUE itself is dominated by other approaches. In addition, we propose
the use of SURE as a constructive mechanism for deriving new covariance
estimators. Similarly to the classical MLE, all of our proposed estimators have
simple closed form solutions but result in a significant reduction in MSE.

faint transient SN 2008S discovered in NGC 6946. SN 2008S exhibited slow
photometric evolution and almost no spectral variability during the first nine
months, implying a high density CS medium. The light curve is similar in shape
to that of SN 1998S and SN 1979C, although significantly fainter at maximum
light. Our quasi-bolometric lightcurve extends to 300 days and shows a tail
phase decay rate consistent with that of ^{56}Co. We propose that this is
evidence for an explosion and formation of ^{56}Ni (0.0015 +/- 0.0004 M_Sun).
The large MIR flux detected shortly after explosion can be explained by a light
echo from pre-exisiting dust. The late NIR flux excess is plausibly due to a
combination of warm newly-formed ejecta dust together with shock-heated dust in
the CS environment. We reassess the progenitor object detected previously in
Spitzer archive images, supplementing this discussion with a model of the MIR
spectral energy distribution. This supports the idea of a dusty, optically
thick shell around SN 2008S with an inner radius of nearly 90AU and outer
radius of 450AU, and an inferred heating source of 3000 K and luminosity of L ~
10^{4.6} L_Sun. The combination of our monitoring data and the evidence from
the progenitor analysis leads us to support the scenario of a weak electron
capture supernova explosion in a super-AGB progenitor star (of initial mass 6-8
M_sun) embedded within a thick CS gaseous envelope. We suggest that all of main
properties of the electron capture SN phenomenon are observed in SN 2008S and
future observations may allow a definitive answer.

emergence during which the two polarities of the bipolar region become

significant rotational motion sets in within each polarity. The rotational
motions of the two polarities are found to twist up the inner field lines of
the emerged fields such that they change their orientation into an inverse

polarity over the neutral line). As a result, a flux rope with sigmoid-shaped,
dipped core fields form in the corona, and the center of the flux rope rises in
the corona with increasing velocity as the twisting of the flux rope footpoints
continues. The rotational motion in the two polarities is a result of
propagation of non-linear torsional Alfv\'en waves along the flux tube, which
transports significant twist from the tube's interior portion towards its
expanded coronal portion. This is a basic process whereby twisted flux ropes
are developed in the corona with increasing twist and magnetic energy, leading
up to solar eruptions.

polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission features; four of 16 show weak
PAHs and strong silicate absorption, and two objects have no discernable
spectral features. Compared to samples with 24 micron fluxes >10mJy, the 70\um

sources are among the brightest starbursts seen at any redshift, and reside in
a redshift range where other selection methods turn up relatively few sources.
The absorbed sources are at higher redshifts and have higher luminosities than
the PAH dominated sources, and may show weaker luminosity evolution. We
conclude that a 70 micron selection extending to ~20mJy, in combination with
selections at mid-IR and far-IR wavelengths, is necessary to obtain a complete

L\'evy flights in the superdiffusive propagation of fronts in
reaction-diffusion systems is presented. The study is based on a variation of
the Fisher-Kolmogorov equation where the diffusion operator is replaced by a
$\lambda$-truncated fractional derivative of order $\alpha$ where $1/\lambda$
is the characteristic truncation length scale. For $\lambda=0$ there is no
truncation and fronts exhibit exponential acceleration and algebraic decaying
tails. It is shown that for $\lambda \neq 0$ this phenomenology prevails in the
intermediate asymptotic regime $(\chi t)^{1/\alpha} \ll x \ll 1/\lambda$ where
$\chi$ is the diffusion constant. Outside the intermediate asymptotic regime,
i.e. for $x > 1/\lambda$, the tail of the front exhibits the tempered decay
$\phi \sim e^{-\lambda x}/x^{(1+\alpha)} $, the acceleration is transient, and
the front velocity, $v_L$, approaches the terminal speed $v_* = (\gamma -
\lambda^\alpha \chi)/\lambda$ as $t\to \infty$, where it is assumed that
$\gamma > \lambda^\alpha \chi$ with $\gamma$ denoting the growth rate of the
reaction kinetics. However, the convergence of this process is algebraic, $v_L
\sim v_* - \alpha /(\lambda t)$, which is very slow compared to the exponential
convergence observed in the diffusive (Gaussian) case. An over-truncated regime
in which the characteristic truncation length scale is shorter than the length
scale of the decay of the initial condition, $1/\nu$, is also identified. In
this extreme regime, fronts exhibit exponential tails, $\phi \sim e^{-\nu x}$,
and move at the constant velocity, $v=(\gamma - \lambda^\alpha \chi)/\nu$.

Gaussian process with an unknown smooth spectral density f. Asymptotic
equivalence, in the sense of Le Cam's deficiency Delta-distance, to two
Gaussian experiments with simpler structure is established. The first one is
given by independent zero mean Gaussians with variance approximately the value
of f in points of a uniform grid (nonparametric Gaussian scale regression).
This approximation is closely related to well-known asymptotic independence
results for the periodogram and corresponding inference methods. The second
asymptotic equivalence is to a Gaussian white noise model where the drift
function is the log-spectral density. This represents the step from a Gaussian
scale model to a location model, and also has a counterpart in established
inference methods, i.e. log-periodogram regression. The problem of simple
explicit equivalence maps (Markov kernels), allowing to directly carry over
inference, appears in this context but is not solved here.

cold ice grains of micron size. Curiously, though, the expected 1.5 micron band
of water ice was not detected in our data, an observation for which we have no

hot for these grains to be icy. The detection of both water ice spectral

When m=2 and H is close to the boundary value 0, the hypersurfaces look like
two very close n-dimensional spheres with two catenoid necks attached, similar

investigated the exact and approximate symmetries of a Lagrangian for the
geodesic equations in the Kerr spacetime. Taking Minkowski spacetime as the
exact case, it is shown that the symmetry algebra of the Lagrangian is 17
dimensional. This algebra is related to the 15 dimensional Lie algebra of
conformal isometries of Minkowski spacetime. First introducing spin angular
momentum per unit mass as a small parameter we consider first-order approximate
symmetries of the Kerr metric as a first perturbation of the Schwarzschild
metric. We then consider the second-order approximate symmetries of the Kerr
metric as a second perturbation of the Minkowski metric. The approximate
symmetries are recovered for these spacetimes and there are no non-trivial
approximate symmetries. A rescaling of the arc length parameter for consistency
of the trivial second-order approximate symmetries of the geodesic equations
indicates that the energy in the charged-Kerr metric has to be rescaled and the
rescaling factor is $r$-dependent. This rescaling factor is compared with that
for the Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m metric.

the presence of a general curved space-time background described in terms of
Fermi normal co-ordinates, where the spatial part is expressed using general
curvilinear co-ordinates. Adopting the approach first introduced by Barut and
Bracken for Zitterbewegung in the local rest frame of the particle, it is shown
that non-trivial gravitational contributions to the relative position and
momentum operators appear due to the coupling of Zitterbewegung frequency terms
with the Ricci curvature tensor in the Fermi frame, indicating a formal
violation of the weak equivalence principle. Explicit expressions for these
contributions are shown for the case of quasi-circular orbital motion of a
spin-1/2 particle in a Vaidya background. Formal expressions also appear for
the time-derivative of the Pauli-Lubanski vector due to space-time curvature
effects coupled to the Zitterbewegung frequency. As well, the choice of
curvilinear co-ordinates results in non-inertial contributions in the time
evolution of the canonical momentum for the spin-1/2 particle, where
Zitterbewegung effects lead to stability considerations for its propagation,
based on the Floquet theory of differential equations.

Analytical (DA) method are proposed to solve the Extended Hubbard Model in 1D.
We have considered an Extended Hubbard Model (EHM) including on-site and
off-site interactions for closed chains in one dimension with periodic boundary
conditions. The comparison of the SCRPA results with ones obtained by a Direct
Analytical approach shows that the SCRPA treats the problem of these closed
chains with a rigorous manner. The analysis of the nearest-neighbour repulsion
effect on the dynamics of our closed chains shows that this repulsive
interaction between the electrons of the neighbouring atoms induces
supplementary conductivity, since, the SCRPA energy gap vanishes when these
closed chains are governed by a strong repulsive on-site interaction and
intermediate nearest-neighbour repulsion.
