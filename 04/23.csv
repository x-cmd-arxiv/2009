galaxies using high resolution, cosmological SPH + N-Body simulations. These
simulations include a self-consistent treatment of all the major physical
processes involved in galaxy formation. The simulated galaxies presented here
each have a total mass of ~10^12 M_sun, but span a range of merger histories.
These simulations allow us to study the competing importance of in-situ star
formation (stars formed in the primary galaxy) and accretion of stars from
subhalos in the building of stellar halos in a LambdaCDM universe. All four
simulated galaxies are surrounded by a stellar halo, whose inner regions (r <
20 kpc) contain both accreted stars, and an in-situ stellar population. The
outer regions of the galaxies' halos were assembled through pure accretion and
disruption of satellites. Most of the in-situ halo stars formed at high
redshift out of smoothly accreted cold gas in the inner 1 kpc of the galaxies'
potential wells, possibly as part of their primordial disks. These stars were
displaced from their central locations into the halos through a succession of
major mergers. We find that the two galaxies with recently quiescent merger
histories have a higher fraction of in-situ stars (~20-50%) in their inner
halos than the two galaxies with many recent mergers (~5-10% in-situ fraction).
Observational studies concentrating on stellar populations in the inner halo of
the Milky Way will be the most affected by the presence of in-situ stars with
halo kinematics, as we find that their existence in the inner few tens of kpc
is a generic feature of galaxy formation.

Matter (DM), and investigate how its spectrum depends on the choice of DM model
and inhomogeneities in the DM distribution. Below a cutoff energy, the flux is
expected to have a universal power-law form with an index n ~ -2. The cutoff
energy and the behavior of the flux near the cutoff is model dependent. The
dependence on the DM host halo profile may be significant at energies E < 100
GeV and leads to softening of the flux, n < -2. There may be additional
features at high energies due to the presence of local clumps of DM, especially
for models in which the Sommerfeld effect boosts subhalo luminosities. In
general, the flux from a nearby clump gives rise to a harder spectrum of
electrons and positrons, with an index n > -2. Using the Via Lactea II
simulation, we estimate the probability of such subhalo effects in a generic
Sommerfeld-enhanced model to be at least 4%, and possibly as high as 15% if
subhalos below the simulation's resolution limit are accounted for. We discuss
the consequences of these results for the interpretation of the ATIC, PAMELA,

Fabry-Perot interferometer, FaNTOmM. The Tremaine-Weinberg method estimates a
bar pattern speed of (11.3 +/- 2.0) km/s/kpc for UGC 628, which is among the
lowest values found for a spiral galaxy. The corotation radius Rc of the bar
and the gaseous disc is Rc = 9.8 (+2.9/-2.0) kpc, implying a ratio R = Rc/Ab of
2.0 (+0.5/-0.3), where Ab is the bar radius. The ratio is well beyond the usual
range of values, 1.0< R <1.4, found for fast bars of high surface brightness
barred galaxies. It implies that the bar in UGC 628 is slow. As shown through
the use of numerical simulations, fast bars survive when the inner mass
distribution of galaxies is dominated by the baryons over the dark matter. Our
result suggests that the presence of slow bars in galaxies is likely related to
the dominance of dark matter over the mass distribution.

from an individual colloidal quantum dot coupled to an SP waveguide. Our
detectors are both nanoscale and highly efficient (0.1 electrons/plasmon), and
a plasmonic gating effect can be used to amplify the signal even higher (up to
50 electrons/plasmon). These results enable new on-chip optical sensing
applications and are a key step towards ""dark"" optoplasmonic nanocircuits in
which SPs can be generated, manipulated, and detected without involving

rotating black holes (the Blandford-Znajek [1977] mechanism) forms the basis
for some models of the most relativistic jets. We explore a scenario in which
the central inward ""plunging"" region of the accretion flow enhances the
trapping of large scale poloidal field on the black hole. The study is carried
out using a fully relativistic treatment in Kerr spacetime, with the focus
being to determine the spin dependence of the Blandford-Znajek effect. We find
that large scale magnetic fields are enhanced on the black hole compared to the
inner accretion flow and that the ease with which this occurs for lower
prograde black hole spin, produces a spin dependence in the Blandford-Znajek
effect that has attractive applications to recent observations. Among these is
the correlation between inferred accretion rate and nuclear jet power observed
by Allen et al. (2006) in X-ray luminous elliptical galaxies. If the black hole
rotation in these elliptical galaxies is in the prograde sense compared with
that of the inner accretion disk, we show that both the absolute value and the
uniformity of the implied jet-production efficiency can be explained by the
flux-trapping model. The basic scenario that emerges from this study is that a
range of intermediate values of black hole spins could be powering these AGN.
We also suggest that the jets in the most energetic radio-galaxies may be
powered by accretion onto {\it retrograde} rapidly-rotating black holes.

resembles that of the cluster's blue stragglers. Binary companions are required
to explain the implied dynamical masses. We show that the companions cannot be
main-sequence stars and are most likely heavy CO WDs. The number and
photometric masses of the observed He WDs can be understood if ~1-5% of the

companions with orbital periods in the range ~1-20 days at the time they reach

the subject of numerous research mainly impelled by the desire to determine its
exact mechanisms. Despite these efforts, a consensus on this question has yet
to be reached. Experimentally, the peak effect indicates a transition from a
depinned vortex phase to a reentrant pinning phase at high magnetic field. To
study the effects of intrinsic pinning on the peak effect, we consider
Fe$_{x}$Ni$_{1-x}$Zr$_{2}$ superconducting metallic glasses in which the vortex
pinning force varies depending on the Fe content and in which a huge peak
effect is seen as a function of magnetic field. The results are mapped out as a
phase diagram in which it is readily seen that the peak effect becomes broader
with decreasing pinning force. Typically, pinning can be understood by
increased pinning centers, but here, we show that reentrant pinning is due to
the strengthening of interactions (while decreasing pinning strength). Our
results demonstrate the strengthening of the peak effect by collective effects.

  Xia","Incentive Compatible Budget Elicitation in Multi-unit Auctions",,,,,"cs.GT cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider the problem of designing incentive compatible
auctions for multiple (homogeneous) units of a good, when bidders have private
valuations and private budget constraints. When only the valuations are private
and the budgets are public, Dobzinski {\em et al} show that the {\em adaptive
clinching} auction is the unique incentive-compatible auction achieving
Pareto-optimality. They further show thatthere is no deterministic
Pareto-optimal auction with private budgets. Our main contribution is to show
the following Budget Monotonicity property of this auction: When there is only
one infinitely divisible good, a bidder cannot improve her utility by reporting
a budget smaller than the truth. This implies that a randomized modification to
the adaptive clinching auction is incentive compatible and Pareto-optimal with
private budgets.
  The Budget Monotonicity property also implies other improved results in this
context. For revenue maximization, the same auction improves the best-known
competitive ratio due to Abrams by a factor of 4, and asymptotically approaches
the performance of the optimal single-price auction.
  Finally, we consider the problem of revenue maximization (or social welfare)
in a Bayesian setting. We allow the bidders have public size constraints (on
the amount of good they are willing to buy) in addition to private budget
constraints. We show a simple poly-time computable 5.83-approximation to the
optimal Bayesian incentive compatible mechanism, that is implementable in
dominant strategies. Our technique again crucially needs the ability to prevent
bidders from over-reporting budgets via randomization.

as a young embedded cluster of a few hundred stars seen towards the position of
the IRAS source, extending for about 2-4 pc and exhibiting sub-clustering. The
cluster contains low and intermediate-mass young reddened stars, a large
fraction having cleared the inner regions of their circumstellar discs
responsible for (H-Ks) colour excess. The observations are compatible with a <
5 Myr cluster with variable spatial extinction of between Av = 5 and Av = 11.
Decomposition of CO emission in clumps, reveals a clump clearly associated with
the cluster position, of mass 3.3 x 10^3 M(solar). Estimates of the slopes of
the Ks-band luminosity function and of the star-formation efficiency yield
values similar to those seen in nearby star-formation sites. These findings
reinforce previous results that the distant outer Galaxy continues to be active

defines the likelihood for a node to be the one marked, and we want the
strategy that minimizes the expected number of queries. Prior to this paper,
very little was known about this natural question and the complexity of the
problem had remained so far an open question.
  We close this question and prove that the above tree search problem is
NP-complete even for the class of trees with diameter at most 4. This results
in a complete characterization of the complexity of the problem with respect to
the diameter size. In fact, for diameter not larger than 3 the problem can be
shown to be polynomially solvable using a dynamic programming approach.
  In addition we prove that the problem is NP-complete even for the class of
trees of maximum degree at most 16. To the best of our knowledge, the only
known result in this direction is that the tree search problem is solvable in
O(|V| log|V|) time for trees with degree at most 2 (paths).
  We match the above complexity results with a tight algorithmic analysis. We
first show that a natural greedy algorithm attains a 2-approximation.
Furthermore, for the bounded degree instances, we show that any optimal
strategy (i.e., one that minimizes the expected number of queries) performs at
most O(\Delta(T) (log |V| + log w(T))) queries in the worst case, where w(T) is
the sum of the likelihoods of the nodes of T and \Delta(T) is the maximum
degree of T. We combine this result with a non-trivial exponential time
algorithm to provide an FPTAS for trees with bounded degree.

dependent and are divided at [Fe/H]~-1.2. About 40-50% of stars with
[Fe/H]<-1.2 have Na and Al abundances consistent with production solely in Type
II supernovae and match observations of disk and halo stars at comparable
metallicity. The remaining metal-poor stars are enhanced in Na and Al compared
to their disk and halo counterparts and are mostly consistent with predicted
yields from >5 M_sun asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. At [Fe/H]>-1.2, more
than 75% of the stars are Na/Al enhanced and may have formed almost exclusively
from AGB ejecta. Most of these stars are enhanced in Na by at least 0.2 dex for
a given Al abundance than would be expected based on ""normal"" globular cluster

abundances. Eu does not vary extensively as a function of metallicity; however,
[La/Fe] varies from about -0.4 to +2 and stars with [Fe/H]>-1.5 have [La/Eu]

Epimetheus in the company of Earth's Moon and Mars' Phobos as the only natural
satellites for which forced rotational libration has been detected. The forced
libration is caused by the satellite's slightly eccentric orbit and
non-spherical shape.
  Detection of a moon's forced libration allows us to probe its interior by
comparing the measured amplitude to that predicted by a shape model assuming
constant density. A discrepancy between the two would indicate internal density
asymmetries. For Epimetheus, the uncertainties in the shape model are large
enough to account for the measured libration amplitude. For Janus, on the other
hand, although we cannot rule out synchronous rotation, a permanent offset of
several degrees between Janus' minimum moment of inertia (long axis) and the
equilibrium sub-Saturn point may indicate that Janus does have modest internal
density asymmetries.
  The rotation states of Janus and Epimetheus experience a perturbation every
four years, as the two moons ""swap"" orbits. The sudden change in the orbital
periods produces a free libration about synchronous rotation that is
subsequently damped by internal friction. We calculate that this free libration

and is thus below the current limits for detection using Cassini images.

Survey (SDSS). The quasar SDSS J094533.99+100950.1, lying at z = 1.66, has
practically no C IV emission line, a red continuum very similar to the second
steepest of the quasar composite spectra of Richards et al., is not strongly
affected by absorption and the Mg II line, although relatively weak, is strong
enough to measure the black hole mass. The Eddington ratio in this object is
about 0.45, and the line properties are not consistent with the trends expected
at high accretion rates. We propose that the most probable explanation of the
line properties in this object, and perhaps in all weak emission line quasars,
is that the quasar activity has just started. A disk wind is freshly launched
so the low ionization lines which form close to the disk surface are already
observed but the wind has not yet reached the regions where high ionization
lines or narrow line components are formed. The relatively high occurrence of
such a phenomenon may additionally indicate that the quasar active phase
consists of several sub-phases, each starting with a fresh build-up of the
Broad Line Region.

it is never violated. The properly defined Clausius inequality is thus more

two celestial objects in the earliest stages of planet formation. Of primary
concern is the scenario of two rarefied preplanetesimals (RPPs) in circular
heliocentric orbits. The theoretical results are used to develop models of
binary or multiple system formation from RPPs, and explain the observation that
a greater fraction of binaries originated farther from the Sun. At the stage of
RPPs, small-body satellites can form in two ways: a merger between RPPs can
have two centers of contraction, or the formation of satellites from a disc
around the primary or the secondary. Formation of the disc can be caused by
that the angular momentum of the RPP formed by the merger is greater than the
critical angular momentum for a solid body. One or several satellites of the
primary (moving mainly in low-eccentricity orbits) can be formed from this disc
at any separation less than the Hill radius. The first scenario can explain a
system such as 2001 QW322 where the two components have similar masses but are
separated by a great distance. In general, any values for the eccentricity and
inclination of the mutual orbit are possible. Among discovered binaries, the
observed angular momenta are smaller than the typical angular momenta expected
for identical RPPs having the same total mass as the discovered binary and
encountering each other in circular heliocentric orbits. This suggests that the
population of RPPs underwent some contraction before mergers became common.

We find that strong galactic winds with speed of about 600 km/s, in an
energy-driven wind scenario, are needed in order to match the observed column
density distribution function for DLAs and the evolution of the neutral
hydrogen content with redshift. The momentum-driven implementation of the
galactic wind model, that relates the speed and mass load in the wind to the
properties of the dark matter haloes, shows a behaviour which is intermediate
between the energy-driven galactic winds of small (100 km/s) and large (600
km/s) velocities. At z=3 the contribution of haloes of masses between 10^9 and
10^10 h^-1 M_sun, for DLAs below 10^20.8 cm^-2, to the column density
distribution function, is significant. By interpolating physical quantities
along line-of-sights through massive haloes we qualitatively show how different
galactic wind models impact on the IGM around DLAs. Furthermore, we analyse
statistics related to the velocity widths of SiII associated to DLAs: the

Kaluza-Klein recurrences at masses somewhat less than the string scale generate

nearby resonant structure in the dijet mass spectrum would provide a ""smoking

self-gravit ating accretion discs that are subject to realistic cooling. Such
an approach can be used to predict the secular evolution of self-gravitating
discs (which can usefully be compared with future radiation hydrodynamical
simulations) and to define various physical regimes as a function of radius and
equivalent steady state accretion rate. We show that fragmentation is
inevitable, given realistic rates of infall into the disc, once the disc
extends to radii $> 70$ A.U. (in the case of a solar mass central object).
Owing to the outward redistribution of disc material by gravitational torques,
we also predict fragmentation at $> 70$ A.U. even in the case of low angular
momentum cores which initially collapse to a much smaller radius. We point out
that 70 A.U. is close to the median binary separation and propose that such
delayed fragmentation, at the point that the disc expands to $> 70$ A.U.,
ensures the creation of low mass ratio companions that can avoid substantial
further growth and consequent evolution towards unit mass ratio. We thus
propose this as a promising mechanism for producing low mass ratio binaries,
which, while abundant observationally, are severely underproduced in
hydrodynamical models.

parameterizations for the deceleration parameter (constant, linear and abrupt
transition) and two different models that are explicitly parametrized by the

Bayesian analyses are employed to find best fit parameters and compare models
among themselves and with the flat $\Lambda$CDM model. Analytical expressions
and estimates for the deceleration and cosmic jerk parameters today ($q_0$ and
$j_0$) and for the transition redshift ($z_t$) between a past phase of cosmic
deceleration to a current phase of acceleration are given. All models
characterize an accelerated expansion for the universe today and largely
indicate that it was decelerating in the past, having a transition redshift
around 0.5. The cosmic jerk is not strongly constrained by the present
supernovae data. For the most realistic kinematic models the $1\sigma$
confidence limits imply the following ranges of values: $q_0\in[-0.96,-0.46]$,
$j_0\in[-3.2,-0.3]$ and $z_t\in[0.36,0.84]$, which are compatible with the
$\Lambda$CDM predictions, $q_0=-0.57\pm0.04$, $j_0=-1$ and $z_t=0.71\pm0.08$.
We find that even very simple kinematic models are equally good to describe the
data compared to the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model, and that the current
observations are not powerful enough to discriminate among all of them.

intermediate strength, and is consistent with that expected from galaxy groups.

$\frac{d\sigma}{dp_T}$ of photon production from string regge excitations and

on numerical simulations of converging, supersonic flows. Our model applies to
star formation in GMCs dominated by large-scale turbulence, and contains four
main stages: core building, core collapse, envelope infall, and late accretion.
During the building stage, cores form out of dense, post-shock gas, and become
increasingly centrally stratified as the mass grows over time. When the shock
radius defining the core boundary exceeds $R\approx 4 a (4\pi G
\rho_{mean})^{-1/2}$, where $a$ is the isothermal sound speed, a wave of
collapse propagates from the edge to the center. During the building and
collapse stages, density profiles can be fit by Bonnor-Ebert profiles with
temperature 1.2 - 2.9 times the true value. As found previously for initially
static equilibria, outside-in collapse leads to a Larson-Penston density
profile $\rho \approx 8.86 a^2/(4 \pi G r^2)$. The third stage, consisting of
an inside-out wave of gravitational rarefaction leading to $\rho\propto
r^{-3/2}$, $v\propto r^{-1/2}$, is also similar to that for initially-static
spheres, as originally described by Shu. We find that the collapse and infall
stages have comparable duration, $\sim t_{ff}$, consistent with estimates for
observed prestellar and protostellar (Class 0/I) cores. Core building takes
longer, but does not produce high-contrast objects until shortly before
collapse. The time to reach core collapse, and the core mass at collapse,
decrease with increasing inflow Mach number. For all cases the accretion rate
is $\gg a^3/G$ early on but sharply drops off; the final system mass depends on
the duration of late-stage accretion, set by large-scale conditions in a cloud.

While modern technologies are still far from this scale, all theoretical
downscaling of devices terminates at this spatial limit. Here, however, we
break this barrier with electronic quantum encoding scaled to subatomic
densities. We use atomic manipulation to first construct open
nanostructures--""molecular holograms""--which in turn concentrate information
into a medium free of lattice constraints: the quantum states of a
two-dimensional degenerate Fermi gas of electrons. The information embedded in
the holograms is transcoded at even smaller length scales into an atomically
uniform area of a copper surface, where it is densely projected into both two
spatial degrees of freedom and a third holographic dimension mapped to energy.
In analogy to optical volume holography, this requires precise amplitude and
phase engineering of electron wavefunctions to assemble pages of information
volumetrically. This data is read out by mapping the energy-resolved electron
density of states with a scanning tunnelling microscope. As the projection and
readout are both extremely near-field, and because we use native quantum states
rather than an external beam, we are not limited by lensing or collimation and
can create electronically projected objects with features as small as ~0.3 nm.

a new method to study the micromechanics of sharply bent DNAs and the thermal

which can be described by Kadanoff-Baym equations. Typically, and in particular
when numerical solutions are demanded, these Kadanoff-Baym equations are
restricted to Gaussian initial states. However, physical initial states are
non-Gaussian correlated initial states. In particular, renormalizability
requires the initial state to feature n-point correlations that asymptotically
agree with the vacuum correlations at short distances. In order to identify
physical nonequilibrium initial states, it is therefore a precondition to
describe the vacuum correlations of the interacting theory within the
nonequilibrium framework. In this paper, Kadanoff-Baym equations for
non-Gaussian correlated initial states describing vacuum and thermal
equilibrium are derived from the 2PI effective action. A diagrammatic method
for the explicit construction of vacuum and thermal initial correlations from
the 2PI effective action is provided. We present numerical solutions of
Kadanoff-Baym equations for a real scalar Phi^4 quantum field theory which take
the thermal initial 4-point correlation as the leading non-Gaussian correction

an approximation to the complete equilibrium initial state that is
quantitatively and qualitatively significantly improved as compared to Gaussian
initial states.

An example is Mirror
Matter which is the oldest but still viable DM candidate, perhaps not in the
purest form. It can serve as a test-bench for other analogous DM models, since
the properties of macroscopic objects are quite firmly fixed for Mirror Matter.
A pedagogical derivation of virial theorem is given and it is pointed out that
concepts of virial velocity or virial temperature are misleading for some
cases. It is shown that the limits on self-interaction cross-sections derived
from observations of colliding clusters of galaxies are not real limits for
individual particles if they form macroscopic bodies. The effect of the heating
of interstellar medium by Mirror Matter compact stars is very weak but may be
observable. The effect of neutron star heating by accretion of M-baryons may be
negligible. Problems of MACHOs as Mirror Matter stars are touched upon.

predicted scaling relations [Rev. Mod. Phys. {\bf 64}, 961 (1992)]. In
particular, a slowing down logarithmic behavior versus the so-called Kubo

B_0$ is the ratio of the rms magnetic fluctuation field to the magnetic field
strength, and $\xi_\bot$ and $\xi_\|$ are the correlation lengths in respective
dimensions) is found instead of a power-law dependence. These discrepancies are
explained from general principles of Hamiltonian dynamics. We discuss the
implication of Hamiltonian properties in governing the paradigmatic
""percolation"" transport, characterized by $R\to\infty$, associating it with the
concept of pseudochaos (random non-chaotic dynamics with zero Lyapunov
exponents). Applications of this study pertain to both fusion and astrophysical

of the present work is to develop a constitutive model that is able to describe
the behaviour of compacted expansive clays under these coupled

another for the thermo-mechanical behaviour of saturated clays. The elaborated
model has been validated using the thermo-hydro-mechanical test results on the
compacted MX80 bentonite. Comparison between the model prediction and the
experimental data show that this model is able to reproduce the main features
of volume changes: heating at constant suction and pressure induces either
expansion or contraction; the mean yield stress changes with variations of

PAH-degrading Sphingomonas strain CHY-1 has been characterized. The bphB gene
encoding PAH dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (PDDH) was cloned and overexpressed as a
His-tagged protein. The recombinant protein was purified as a homotetramer with
an apparent Mr of 110,000. PDDH oxidized the cis-dihydrodiols derived from
biphenyl and eight polycyclic hydrocarbons, including chrysene,
benz[a]anthracene, and benzo[a]pyene, to corresponding catechols. Remarkably,
the enzyme oxidized pyrene 4,5-dihydrodiol, whereas pyrene is not metabolized
by strain CHY-1. The PAH catechols produced by PDDH rapidly auto-oxidized in
air but were regenerated upon reaction of the o-quinones formed with NADH.
Kinetic analyses performed under anoxic conditions revealed that the enzyme
efficiently utilized two- to four-ring dihydrodiols, with Km values in the
range of 1.4 to 7.1 $\mu$M, and exhibited a much higher Michaelis constant for
NAD+ (Km of 160 $\mu$M). At pH 7.0, the specificity constant ranged from (1.3
$\pm$ 0.1) x 106 M?1 s?1 with benz[a]anthracene 1,2-dihydrodiol to (20.0 $\pm$
0.8) x 106 M?1 s?1 with naphthalene 1,2-dihydrodiol. The catalytic activity of
the enzyme was 13-fold higher at pH 9.5. PDDH was subjected to inhibition by
NADH and by 3,4-dihydroxyphenanthrene, and the inhibition patterns suggested
that the mechanism of the reaction was ordered Bi Bi. The regulation of PDDH
activity appears as a means to prevent the accumulation of PAH catechols in
bacterial cells.

the origin of time in physics. The currently dominant approaches to a candidate
quantum theory of gravity have naturally evolved from general relativity, on
the one hand, and from particle physics, on the other hand. A third important
branch of 20th century `fundamental' physics, condensed-matter physics, also
offers an interesting perspective on quantum gravity, and thereby on the
problem of time. The bottomline might sound disappointing: to understand the
origin of time, much more experimental input is needed than what is available
today. Moreover it is far from obvious that we will ever find out the true
origin of physical time, even if we become able to directly probe physics at
the Planck scale. But we might learn some interesting lessons about time and
the structure of our universe in the process. A first lesson is that there are
probably several characteristic scales associated with ""quantum gravity""
effects, rather than the single Planck scale usually considered. These can
differ by several orders of magnitude, and thereby conspire to hide certain
effects expected from quantum gravity, rendering them undetectable even with
Planck-scale experiments. A more tentative conclusion is that the hierarchy
between general relativity, special relativity and Newtonian physics, usually
taken for granted, might have to be interpreted with caution.

approximate and stochastic measurement-based quantum computation, in the sense
that any quantum state can be generated from a given resource by means of
single-qubit (local) operations assisted by classical communication. More
precisely, we consider the approximate and stochastic generation of states,
resulting e.g. from a restriction to finite measurement settings or from
possible imperfections in the resources or local operations. We show that
entanglement-based criteria for universality obtained for the exact,
deterministic case can be lifted to the much more general approximate,
stochastic case, moving from the idealized situation considered in previous
works, to the practically relevant context of non-perfect state preparation. We
find that any entanglement measure fulfilling some basic requirements needs to
reach its maximum value on some element of an approximate, stochastic universal
family of resource states, as the resource size grows. This allows us to rule
out various families of states as being approximate, stochastic universal. We
provide examples of resources that are efficient approximate universal, but not
exact deterministic universal. We also study the robustness of universal
resources for measurement-based quantum computation under realistic assumptions
about the (imperfect) generation and manipulation of entangled states, giving
an explicit expression for the impact that errors made in the preparation of
the resource have on the possibility to use it for universal approximate and
stochastic state preparation. Finally, we discuss the relation between our
entanglement-based criteria and recent results regarding the uselessness of
states with a high degree of geometric entanglement as universal resources.

subject of intensive research and development during the last two decades.
Efforts have been directed to both, better solutions for the general data model
and to develop more realistic models. So far, many authors have assumed the
data to be iid samples of a multivariate statistical model. Although this
assumption reduces the complexity of the model, it may not be true in certain
situations where signals show temporal correlation. Some results are available
on the temporally correlated signal model in the literature. The temporally
correlated stochastic Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) has been calculated and an
instrumental variable-based method called IV-SSF is introduced. Also, it has
been shown that temporally correlated CRB is lower bounded by the deterministic
CRB. In this paper, we show that temporally correlated CRB is also upper
bounded by the stochastic iid CRB. We investigate the effect of temporal
correlation of the signals on the best achievable performance. We also show
that the IV-SSF method is not efficient and based on an analysis of the CRB,
propose a variation in the method which boosts its performance. Simulation
results show the improved performance of the proposed method in terms of lower
bias and error variance.

utilizes extended symmetries and quantum groupoid, algebroid and functorial
representations of non-Abelian higher dimensional structures pertinent to
quantized spacetime topology and state space geometry of quantum operator
algebras. Fourier transforms, generalized Fourier-Stieltjes transforms, and
duality relations link, respectively, the quantum groups and quantum groupoids
with their dual algebraic structures; quantum double constructions are also
discussed in this context in relation to quasi-triangular, quasi-Hopf algebras,
bialgebroids, Grassmann-Hopf algebras and higher dimensional algebra. On the

quantum Yang-Baxter equation. On the other hand, our novel approach to extended

to locally covariant general relativity theories that are consistent with

in biphasic cultures where the hydrocarbon was dissolved in an inert
non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL), suggesting that the transfer of the
hydrophobic substrate to the cells was a growth-limiting factor. Carbon balance
calculation as well as organic carbon measurement indicated a release of
metabolites in the culture medium. Further analysis by gas chromatography
revealed that a single metabolite accumulated during growth. This metabolite
had a molecular mass of 114 Da as determined by GC/MS and was provisionally
identified as 4-ethyldihydrofuran-2(3H)-one by LC-MS/MS analysis.
Identification was confirmed by analysis of the chemically synthesized lactone.

is converted to 4-ethyldihydrofuran-2(3H)-one, which cannot be metabolised
further by strain IFP 2173. This putative pathway provides an explanation for
the low energetic efficiency of 2-EHN degradation and its poor

Lyapunov Indicator (FLI) method. By mapping out the variety of dynamical
regimes in the phase space of this molecule, we obtain the degree of regularity

Thermo-Hydro-Mechanical (THM) behaviour of Boom clay, relatively few were
devoted to the time dependent behaviour, limiting any relevant analysis of the
long-term behaviour of the disposal facility. The present work aims at
investigating the time-dependent behaviour of Boom clay under both thermal and
mechanical loading. High-pressure triaxial tests at controlled temperatures
were carried out for this purpose. The tests started with constant-rate thermal
and/or mechanical consolidation and ended with isobar heating and/or isothermal
compression at a constant stress rate or by step loading. Significant effects
of temperature as well as of compression and heating rates were observed on the
volume change behaviour. After being loaded to a stress lower than the
pre-consolidation pressure (5 MPa) at a low temperature of 25\degree C and at a
rate lower than 0.2 kPa/min, the sample volume changes seemed to be quite
small, suggesting a full dissipation of pore water pressure. By contrast, after
being subjected to high loading and heating rates (including step loading or
step heating), the volume changes appeared to be significant, particularly in
the case of stresses much higher than the pre-consolidation pressure. Due to
low permeability, full consolidation of Boom clay required a long period of
time and it was difficult to distinguish consolidation and creep from the total
volume change with time.

X-ray mass measurements is a function of cluster radius. Numerical simulations
also point out that X-ray mass proxies do not work equally well at all radii.
The origin of the effect is thought to be associated with cluster mergers.
Recent work presenting the cluster maps showed an ability of X-ray maps to
reveal and study cluster mergers in detail. Here we present a first attempt to
use the study of substructure in assessing the systematics of the hydrostatic
mass measurements using two-dimensional (2-D) X-ray diagnostics. The
temperature map is uniquely able to identify the substructure in an almost
relaxed cluster which would be unnoticed in the ICM electron number density and
pressure maps. We describe the radial fluctuations in the 2-D maps by a
cumulative/differential scatter profile relative to the mean profile within/at
a given radius. The amplitude indicates ~10 fluctuations in the temperature,
electron number density and entropy maps, and ~15 fluctuations in the pressure
map. The amplitude of and the discontinuity in the scatter complement 2-D
substructure diagnostics, e.g. indicating the most disturbed radial range.
There is a tantalizing link between the substructure identified using the
scatter of the entropy and pressure fluctuations and the hydrostatic mass bias
relative to the expected mass based on the M-Yx and M-Mgas relations
particularly at r500. XMM-Newton observations with ~120,000 source photons from
the cluster are sufficient to apply our substructure diagnostics via the
spectrally measured 2-D temperature, electron number density, entropy and

decoupled in the ordering of the model. The chiral-glass exponents are
estimated to be \nu_{CG}=1.4+-0.2 and \eta_{CG}=0.6+-0.2, indicating that the
chiral-glass transition lies in a universality class different from that of the
Ising spin glass. The possibility that the spin and chiral sectors undergo a
simultaneous Kosterlitz-Thouless-type transition is ruled out. The chiral-glass
state turns out to be non-self-averaging, possibly accompanying a one-step-like
peculiar replica-symmetry breaking. Implications to the chirality scenario of
experimental spin-glass transitions are discussed.

been inferred from high resolution methanol maser observations in NGC7538-IRS1

proposed as an alternative explanation. We compare the two proposed scenarios
for best consistency with the observations. Using a newly developed formalism
we model the optical depth of the maser emission at each observed point in the
map and LOS velocity for the two scenarios. We find that if the emission is
symmetric around a central peak in both space and LOS velocity then it has to
arise from an edge-on disc in sufficiently fast differential rotation. Disc
models successfully fit ~100 independent measurement points in
position-velocity space with 4 free parameters to an overall accuracy of 3-4%.
Solutions for Keplerian rotation require a central mass of at least 4 solar
masses. Close to best-fitting models are obtained if Keplerian motion is
assumed around a central mass equaling ~30 solar masses as inferred from other
observations. In contrast we find that classical bipolar outflow models cannot
fit the data, although could be applicable in other sources. Our results
strongly favour the differentially rotating disc hypothesis to describe the
main feature of the 12.2 (and 6.7) GHz methanol maser emission in NGC7538 IRS1

predict the position and velocity at which tangentially amplified masers should

the pion, the total inelastic cross{}-section is bounded by $(1/4)(\pi/m_\pi^2)
\ln^2 s$, which is 4 times smaller. We discuss the implications of this result
on the total cross{}-section itself.
