Classical hydrodynamic equations of motion are written for this model in the

dressed Fermi momenta of the model. Hydrodynamic equations reduce to a set of
decoupled Riemann-Hopf (or inviscid Burgers') equations for the dressed Fermi

in the sample are well described by a simple axisymmetric power-law profile for
the total density, with a logarithmic slope gamma very close to isothermal
(<gamma> = 1.98 +/- 0.05 and an intrinsic spread close to 5 per cent) showing
no evidence of evolution over the probed range of redshift; (ii) the axial
ratio of the total density distribution is rounder than 0.65 and in all cases,
except for a fast rotator, does not deviate significantly from the flattening
of the intrinsic stellar distribution; (iii) the dark matter fraction within
the effective radius has a lower limit of about 15 to 30 per cent; (iv) the
sample galaxies are only mildly anisotropic, with delta <= 0.16; (v) the
physical distinction among slow and fast rotators, quantified by the v/sigma

chromatic refraction (DCR), whereby objects imaged at different optical/UV
wavelengths are observed at slightly different positions in the plane of the
detector. Strong spectral features induce changes in the effective wavelengths
of broad-band filters that are capable of producing significant positional
offsets with respect to standard DCR corrections. We examine such offsets for
broad-emission-line (type 1) quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
spanning 0<z<5 and an airmass range of 1.0 to 1.8. These offsets are in good
agreement with those predicted by convolving a composite quasar spectrum with
the SDSS bandpasses as a function of redshift and airmass. This astrometric
information can be used to break degeneracies in photometric redshifts of
quasars (or other emission-line sources) and, for extreme cases, may be
suitable for determining ""astrometric redshifts"". On the SDSS's southern
equatorial stripe, where it is possible to average many multi-epoch
measurements, more than 60% of quasars have emission-line-induced astrometric
offsets larger than the SDSS's relative astrometric errors of 25-35 mas.
Folding these astrometric offsets into photometric redshift estimates yields an
improvement of 9% within Delta z+/-0.1. Future multi-epoch synoptic surveys
such as LSST and Pan-STARRS could benefit from intentionally making ~10

been performed using the self-consistent finite-temperature Hartree-Fock+BCS
(FT-HF+BCS) formalism with the SkM* Skyrme energy density functional. The
calculations have been carried out for even-even superheavy nuclei with Z
ranging between 110 and 124. For an accurate description of fission pathways,
the effects of triaxial and reflection-asymmetric degrees of freedom have been
fully incorporated. Our survey demonstrates that the dependence of isentropic
fission barriers on excitation energy changes rapidly with particle number,
pointing to the importance of shell effects even at large excitation energies
characteristic of compound nuclei. The fastest decrease of fission barriers
with excitation energy is predicted for deformed nuclei around N=164 and
spherical nuclei around N=184 that are strongly stabilized by ground-state
shell effects. For nuclei 240Pu and 256Fm, which exhibit asymmetric spontaneous
fission, our calculations predict a transition to symmetric fission at high
excitation energies due to the thermal quenching of static reflection
asymmetric deformations.

singular, and the other one is a milder ""non-metric singularity"" where the

charged black holes, with particular focus on whether these two types of

of the modification, and find that the theory exhibits `screening' effects of
the electric charge (or `anti-screening', depending upon the sign of the
modification term), in the sense that it leads to the possibility of charging
the black hole more (or less) than it would be possible in general relativity
without exposing a naked singularity. We also find that for any (even
arbitrarily large) value of charge, true singularities of the theory appear to
be either achronal (non-timelike) covered by the hypersurface of a harmless

C. The second one is a prospective study to identify gustatory alterations due
to chorda tympani nerve involvement in patients with chronic otitis media
without prior surgery.
  Results: No significant difference was detected between the two treatments
related to the chronic hepatitis C (p > 0.5). On the other hand, a significant
association was observed between the healthy side and the affected side of the
face of patients with chronic otitis media related to gustatory alterations (p

applied to a carbon mono-layer (graphene), a gap between the valence and

It is found that it does not correspond to a band insulator: a constant
electric field induces a quantized Hall current even though the magnetic flux
through the sample is zero and there are no Landau levels. The phenomenon is of
the same type as that discovered by Haldane for a graphene sample in a periodic
magnetic field that is not smooth, i.e. varies rapidly on the scale of the
graphene lattice constant. The effect can be explained in terms of the
topological theory of Thouless, Kohmoto, Nightingale and den Nijs. For the
system studied in this paper, an explanation in terms of simple physical
principles is also presented. Thus some of the mystery is taken out of the
apparently strange phenomenon of a Hall effect without magnetic flux.
Furthermore, Haldane's model requires control over external magnetic fields on
length scales less than an angstrom and is therefore hard to realize
experimentally. For the model studied here, control over external fields on
length scales that are larger by two orders of magnitude or more is sufficient.
The model is therefore more amenable to experimental realization.

that it is possible to reproduce the extended loop lifetime, high electron

hydrodynamic model provided that the time scale for the energy release is
sufficiently short. The model, however, does not reproduce the evolution of the
very high temperature emission observed with XRT. In XRT the emission appears
diffuse and it may be that this discrepancy is simply due to the difficulty of
isolating individual loops at these temperatures. This discrepancy may also
reflect fundamental problems with our understanding of post-reconnection
dynamics during the conductive cooling phase of loop evolution.

The first is to use the rise times and decay times in the radio, ultraviolet

mechanisms affecting the relativistic electron distributions. HST-1 is the
first jet knot clearly resolved from the nuclear emission by Chandra and is the
site of the huge flare of 2005. We find clear evidence for a
frequency-dependent decrease in the synchrotron flux being consistent with
E-squared energy losses. Assuming that this behavior is predominantly caused by
synchrotron cooling, we estimate a value of 0.6 mG for the average magnetic
field strength of the HST-1 emission region, a value consistent with previous
estimates of the equipartition field. In the process of analyzing the first
derivative of the X-ray light curve of HST-1, we discovered a quasi-periodic
oscillation which was most obvious in 2003 and 2004 prior to the major flare in
2005. The four cycles observed have a period of order 6 months. The second goal
is to search for evidence of differences between the X-ray variability
timescales of HST-1 and the unresolved nuclear region (diameter <0.6""). These
features, separated by more than 60 pc, are the two chief contenders for the
origin of the TeV variable emissions observed by HESS in 2005 and by MAGIC and
VERITAS in 2008. The X-ray variability of the nucleus appears to be at least
twice as rapid as that of the HST-1 knot. However, the shortest nuclear
variability timescale we can measure from the Chandra data (<= 20 days) is
still significantly longer than the shortest TeV variability of M87 reported by
the HESS and MAGIC telescopes (1-2 days).

from a recent analysis, and $\Delta_{32}$, $\theta_{13}$, and $\theta_{23}$ are
varied. We utilize the full three-neutrino oscillation probability and an exact
treatment of the Earth's MSW effect with a castle-wall density. By including
terms linear in $\theta_{13}$ and $\varepsilon := \theta_{23} - \pi/4$, we find
asymmetric errors for these parameters $\theta_{13}=-0.07^{+0.18}_{-0.11}$ and
$\varepsilon=0.03^{+0.09}_{-0.15}$. For $\theta_{13}$, we see that the lower
bound is primarily set by the CHOOZ experiment while the upper bound is
determined by the low energy $e$-like events in the Super-K atmospheric data.
We find that the parameters $\theta_{13}$ and $\varepsilon$ are correlated --
the preferred negative value of $\theta_{13}$ permits the preferred value of
$\theta_{23}$ to be in the second octant, and the true value of $\theta_{13}$
affects the allowed region for $\theta_{23}$.

mass segregation on the early and long-term evolution of star clusters. Our
simulations show that in segregated clusters early mass loss due to stellar
evolution triggers a stronger expansion than for unsegregated clusters. Tidally
limited, strongly segregated clusters may dissolve rapidly as a consequence of
this early expansion, while segregated clusters initially underfilling their
Roche lobe can survive the early expansion and have a lifetime similar to that
of unsegregated clusters. Long-lived initially segregated clusters tend to have
looser structure and reach core collapse later in their evolution than
initially unsegregated clusters. We have also compared the effects of dynamical
evolution on the global stellar mass function (MF) of low-mass main sequence
stars. In all cases the MF flattens as the cluster loses stars. The amount of
MF flattening induced by a given amount of mass loss in a rapidly dissolving
initially segregated cluster is less than for an unsegregated cluster. The
evolution of the MF of a long-lived segregated cluster, on the other hand, is
very similar to that of an initially unsegregated cluster.

emerging from the source, for different lensing configurations. If the lens has
a power law profile M propto R^gamma, the angle delta initially increases with
lens redshift and then either diverges (for a steep profile gamma<1), remains
constant (for an isothermal profile gamma=1), or vanishes (for a shallow
profile gamma>1) as zl approaches zs. The scaling with lens mass is roughly
delta propto M^(1/(2-gamma)). The results for an NFW profile are qualitatively
similar to those for a shallow power law, with delta peaking at about half the
redshift of the source (not half the distance). In practice, beaming could
modify the statistics of beamed sources lensed by massive clusters: for an
opening angle theta_jet, there is a probability as high as P ~ 0.02-0.07

objects are considerably fainter (H=20.4, and 21.6 mag) and more distant
(projected separations of 612, and 534 AU) than the three known planetary

Gemini adaptive optics images to archival HST/NICMOS images. With nearly a

collected during a 40 night observing run in late 2003, and the 268 GHz
observations were made in early 2004 and early 2005 over a total of 60 nights.
Below 0.5 Hz, the data time-streams are dominated by atmospheric noise in all
observing conditions. The atmospheric noise data are consistent with a
Kolmogorov-Taylor (K-T) turbulence model for a thin wind-driven screen, and the
median amplitude of the fluctuations is 280 mK^2 rad^(-5/3) at 143 GHz and 4000
mK^2 rad^(-5/3) at 268 GHz. Comparing our results with previous ACBAR data, we
find that the normalization of the power spectrum of the atmospheric noise
fluctuations is a factor of 80 larger above Mauna Kea than above the South Pole
at millimeter wavelengths. Most of this difference is due to the fact that the
atmosphere above the South Pole is much drier than the atmosphere above Mauna
Kea. However, the atmosphere above the South Pole is slightly more stable as
well: the fractional fluctuations in the column depth of precipitable water
vapor are a factor of sqrt(2) smaller at the South Pole compared to Mauna Kea.
Based on our atmospheric modeling, we developed several algorithms to remove
the atmospheric noise, and the best results were achieved when we described the
fluctuations using a low-order polynomial in detector position over the 8
arcmin field of view (FOV). However, even with these algorithms, we were not

distribution of attractor lengths differs markedly from that obtained by
randomly choosing an initial state and following the dynamics to reach an
attractor. Our results indicate that the former distribution decays as a
power-law with exponent 1 for all connectivities $K>1$ in the infinite system
size limit. In contrast, the latter distribution decays as a power law only for
K=2. This is because the mean basin size grows linearly with the attractor
cycle length for $K>2$, and is statistically independent of the cycle length
for K=2. We also find that the histograms of basin sizes are strongly peaked at

by ADAMTS13 using molecular dynamics simulations. We indeed observed stepwise
unfolding of A2 and exposure of its deeply buried ADAMTS13 cleavage site.
Interestingly, disulfide bonds in the adjacent and highly homologous VWF A1 and
A3 domains obstruct their mechanical unfolding. We generated a full length

an attempt to lock A2 against unfolding. We find this mutant to feature
ADAMTS13-resistant behavior in vitro. Our results yield molecular-detail

in VWF due to shear flow selectively exposes the A2 proteolysis site to
ADAMTS13 for cleavage while keeping the folded remainder of A2 intact and
functional. We find the unconventional knotted Rossman fold of A2 to be the key
to this mechanical response, tailored for regulating VWF size and activity.
Based on our model we can explain the pathomechanism of some natural mutations

so extensively followed in the X-ray bands.
  Here we report on SN 1993J observations with the {\it Chandra} in the year
2005 and 2008, and Swift observations in 2005, 2006 and 2008. We combined these
observations with all available archival data of SN 1993J, which includes
ROSAT, ASCA, {\it Chandra}, and XMM-{\it Newton} observations from 1993 April
to 2006 August. In this paper we report the X-ray light curves of SN 1993J,
extending up to fifteen years, in the soft (0.3--2.4 keV), hard (2--8 keV) and
combined (0.3--8 keV) bands. The hard and soft-band fluxes decline at different
rates initially, but after about 5 years they both undergo a $t^{-1}$ decline.
The soft X-rays, which are initially low, start dominating after a few hundred
days. We interpret that most of the emission below 8 keV is coming from the
reverse shock which is radiative initially for around first 1000-2000 days and
then turn into adiabatic shock. Our hydrodynamic simulation also confirms the
reverse shock origin of the observed light curves. We also compare the
H$\alpha$ line luminosity of SN 1993J with its X-ray light curve and note that
the H$\alpha$ line luminosity has a fairly high fraction of the X-ray emission,
indicating presence of clumps in the emitting plasma.

and levitated in a strong, inhomogeneous magnetic field. When the temperature
of the system becomes very low compared to the cyclotron gap energy, the system
remains in its quantum ground state. Two such levitated charged drops can have
their charge-to-mass ratio critically adjusted so that the forces of gravity
and electricity between the drops are in balance. Then it is predicted that the
amount of scattered electromagnetic and gravitational radiation from the drops
are equalized, along with these two kinds of forces. The cross sections for the
scattering of the two kinds of radiation can become large, hard-sphere
cross-sections at the first Mie resonance, due to the hard-wall boundary
conditions on the surfaces of the spheres for both kinds of radiations. An
efficient quantum transduction process between electromagnetic and
gravitational radiation by such a pair of drops is predicted at microwave
frequencies, and a Hertz-like experiment is proposed. A more practical
implementation of these ideas to use pairs of levitated, charged
superconducting spheres is briefly discussed.

follow the protostellar collapse up to densities of $\sim10^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$ in
a one-zone model. In the intergalactic medium (IGM), comoving field strengths
of $\gtrsim0.1$ nG lead to Jeans masses of $10^8 M_\odot$ or more and thus
delay gravitational collapse in the first halos until they are sufficiently
massive. During protostellar collapse, we find that the temperature minimum at
densities of $\sim10^3$ cm$^{-3}$ does not change significantly, such that the
characteristic mass scale for fragmentation is not affected. However, we find a
significant temperature increase at higher densities for comoving field
strengths of $\gtrsim0.1$ nG. This may delay gravitational collapse, in
particular at densities of $\sim10^9$ cm$^{-3}$, where the proton abundance
drops rapidly and the main contribution to the ambipolar diffusion resistivity
is due to collisions with Li$^+$. After the formation of the protostar, the
increased gas temperatures may enhance the protostellar accretion rate. Our
model confirms that initial weak magnetic fields may be amplified considerably
during gravitational collapse and become dynamically relevant. For instance, a
comoving field strength above $10^{-5}$ nG will be amplified above the critical
value for the onset of jets which can magnetize the IGM.

  Algebra",,,,"math.AC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Let R be a local Cohen-Macaulay ring with canonical module \omega_R. We
investigate the following question of Huneke: If the sequence of Betti numbers
\{\beta_i^R(\omega_R)\} has polynomial growth, must R be Gorenstein? This
question is well-understood when R has minimal multiplicity. We investigate
this question for a more general class of rings which we say are homologically
of minimal multiplicity. We provide several characterizations of the rings in
this class and establish a general ascent and descent result.

dimensional-regularized gauge theories has been proposed. For conformal
theories, such relation involves a universal eikonal contribution plus a
non-eikonal contribution, related to the subleading term in the anomalous
dimension of twist two operators with large spin. In this note we make use of
the AdS/CFT correspondence in order to check such conjecture at strong coupling
for the case of N=4 SYM.

investigated using density functional calculations. We find that these systems
behave as coherent alloys from the electronic structure point of view. In
particular, the isoelectronic substitution of Fe by Ru does not provide doping,
but rather suppresses the spin density wave characteristic of the pure Fe
compound by a reduction in the Stoner enhancement and an increase in the band
width due hybridization involving Ru. The electronic structure near the Fermi
level otherwise remains quite similar to that of BaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$. The
behavior of the Ir alloy is similar, except that in this case there is
additional electron doping.

cavity exhibiting Fano resonance into a conventional interferometer. By
employing the scattering-matrix approach, we demonstrate that the transmission
is sensitive to a position of the cavity such that an asymmetric structure
exhibits a series of narrow resonances with almost perfect reflection. We
discuss how to implement this novel geometry in two-dimensional photonic
crystals and use direct numerical simulations to demonstrate novel regimes of
the resonant transmission and reflection.

integrable systems of nonlinear partial differential equations with a special
stress on the nonisospectral case. We discuss different approaches to the
Darboux-Backlund transformation, based on different lambda-dependencies of the
Darboux matrix: polynomial, sum of partial fractions, or the transfer matrix
form. We derive symmetric N-soliton formulas in the general case. The matrix
spectral parameter and dressing actions in loop groups are also discussed. We
describe reductions to twisted loop groups, unitary reductions, the matrix Lax
pair for the KdV equation and reductions of chiral models (harmonic maps) to
SU(n) and to Grassmann spaces. We show that in the KdV case the nilpotent
Darboux matrix generates the binary Darboux transformation. The paper is
intended as a review of known results (usually presented in a novel context)
but some new results are included as well, e.g., general compact formulas for
N-soliton surfaces and linear and bilinear constraints on the nonisospectral
Lax pair matrices which are preserved by Darboux transformations.

systems that are invisible to tunneling by a passing wave packet.
