assignments at the introductory level. First, novice students often treat
computer code as almost magic incantations, and like novices in many fields,
have trouble creating new algorithms or procedures to solve novel problems.
Second, the nature of computational studies often means that the results
generated are interpreted via theoretically devised quantities, which may not
meet a student's internal standards for proof when compared to an experimental
measurement.
  The paper then offers a lab/programming assignment, used in a calculus-based
physics course, which was devised to address these problems. In the assignment,
students created a computational model of the heat flow involved in heating an
iron rod in a blacksmith's forge. After creating the simulation, students
attended a blacksmithing seminar and had a chance to work with iron and take
data on its heating in a coke-fueled forge. On their return to campus, students
revised their computational models in light of their experimental data.

several applications, which include these AFM micrometer-sized cantilevers as

the cross-section is not constant along the cantilever length (case of
?V-shaped? micro-cantilevers), their resonant frequencies can not be
analytically calculated. Firstly, in order to validate the accuracy of our FEM
approach, we carried out a comparison between analytical, experimental and
FEM-computed values of the resonant frequencies for homogenous rectangular

with a thin sensitive layer (50 nm of Gold). To precisely calculate the
resonant frequencies of these multilayer-cantilevers, the influence of the mesh

the sensitivity of different ?V-shaped? silicon cantilevers was estimated, as a
function of their geometrical dimensions and of their mechanical parameters
(Young modulus, density). The resonant frequencies of uncoated cantilevers were
calculated and compared with the values experimentally determined. Then, a
similar approach was employed to predict the sensitivities of such cantilevers
recovered with a sensitive layer.

invaluable source of information about the most energetic phenomena in the
Universe. Neutrinos can shed light on the processes that accelerate charge
particles in an incredibly wide range of energies both within and outside our
Galaxy. They can also help to investigate the nature of the dark matter that
pervades the Universe. The unique properties of the neutrino make it peerless
as a cosmic messenger, enabling the study of dense and distant astrophysical
objects at high energy. The experimental challenge, however, is enormous. Due
to the weakly interacting nature of neutrinos and the expected low fluxes very
large detectors are required. In this paper we briefly review the neutrino
telescopes under the Mediterranean Sea that are operating or in progress. The
first line of the ANTARES telescope started to take data in March 2006 and the
full 12-line detector was completed in May 2008. By January 2009 more than one
thousand neutrino events had been reconstructed. Some of the results of ANTARES
will be reviewed. The NESTOR and NEMO projects have made a lot of progress to
demonstrate the feasibility of their proposed technological solutions. Finally,
the project of a km3-scale telescope, KM3NeT, is rapidly progressing: a
conceptual design report was published in 2008 and a technical design report is
expected to be delivered by the end of 2009.

investigated. It is calculated that the image is enlarged by about 20% in inner
diameter compared to the real object, which is validated by the experimental
results. Meanwhile, the image deformation by adding a rectangular optical

lattice parameter beta = 0, considering relatively large lattice volumes for
the case of the SU(2) gauge group in three and four space-time dimensions. We
compare the lattice data to the so-called massive and conformal-scaling
solutions, examining the requirements for a good description of the propagators
over various ranges of momenta and discussing possible systematic errors. Our
analysis strongly supports the massive solution, i.e. a finite gluon propagator
and an essentially free ghost propagator in the infrared limit, in disagreement
with Ref. [1]. Moreover, we argue that discretization effects play no role in
the analysis of these propagators.

population imbalance (or equivalently the mismatch in chemical potentials)
corresponds to the Larkin-Ovchinnikov-Fulde-Ferrell (LOFF) state in the
vicinity of the Lifshitz critical point. It is shown that under these
conditions the critical angular velocity in two-dimensional systems is an
oscillating function of temperature and population imbalance giving rise to
reentrant superfluid phases. This leads to vortex lattices with
multiple-quantized circulation quanta. The reason for this behavior is the
population by Cooper pairs of the Landau levels above the lowest one.

waveguides. One of the system components is a standard waveguide fabricated
from nonlinear medium having positive refraction and another component is a
waveguide produced from an artificial material having negative refraction. The
metamaterial constituting the second waveguide has linear characteristics and a
wave propagating in the waveguide of this type propagates in the direction
opposite to direction of energy flux. It is found that the coupled nonlinear
solitary waves propagating both in the same direction are exist in this
oppositely-directed coupler due to linear coupling between nonlinear positive
refractive waveguide and linear negative refractive waveguide. The
corresponding analytical solution is found and it is used for numerical
simulation to illustrate that the results of the solitary wave collisions are
sensible to the relative velocity of the colliding solitary waves.

Hall effect (AHE), focusing on recent developments that have provided a more
complete framework for understanding this subtle phenomenon and have, in many
instances, replaced controversy by clarity. Synergy between experimental and
theoretical work, both playing a crucial role, has been at the heart of these
advances. On the theoretical front, the adoption of Berry-phase concepts has
established a link between the AHE and the topological nature of the Hall
currents which originate from spin-orbit coupling. On the experimental front,
new experimental studies of the AHE in transition metals, transition-metal
oxides, spinels, pyrochlores, and metallic dilute magnetic semiconductors, have
more clearly established systematic trends. These two developments in concert
with first-principles electronic structure calculations, strongly favor the
dominance of an intrinsic Berry-phase-related AHE mechanism in metallic
ferromagnets with moderate conductivity. The intrinsic AHE can be expressed in
terms of Berry-phase curvatures and it is therefore an intrinsic quantum
mechanical property of a perfect cyrstal. An extrinsic mechanism, skew
scattering from disorder, tends to dominate the AHE in highly conductive
ferromagnets. We review the full modern semiclassical treatment of the AHE
together with the more rigorous quantum-mechanical treatments based on the Kubo
and Keldysh formalisms, taking into account multiband effects, and demonstrate
the equivalence of all three linear response theories in the metallic regime.
Finally we discuss outstanding issues and avenues for future investigation.
