astronomical signal in a flat band power to be less than 105 microK^2 at 95%

secondary CMB anisotropies from the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) to

wish to generate a random bit in order to choose between two alternatives. This
task is impossible to realize when it relies solely on the asynchronous
exchange of classical bits: one dishonest player has complete control over the
final outcome. It is only when coin flipping is supplemented with quantum
communication that this problem can be alleviated, although partial bias
remains. Unfortunately, practical systems are subject to loss of quantum data,
which restores complete or nearly complete bias in previous protocols. We
report herein on the first implementation of a quantum coin-flipping protocol
that is impervious to loss. Moreover, in the presence of unavoidable
experimental noise, we propose to use this protocol sequentially to implement
many coin flips, which guarantees that a cheater unwillingly reveals
asymptotically, through an increased error rate, how many outcomes have been
fixed. Hence, we demonstrate for the first time the possibility of flipping
coins in a realistic setting. Flipping quantum coins thereby joins quantum key
distribution as one of the few currently practical applications of quantum
communication. We anticipate our findings to be useful for various
cryptographic protocols and other applications, such as an online casino, in
which a possibly unlimited number of coin flips has to be performed and where
each player is free to decide at any time whether to continue playing or not.

during ~0.2Myr. We search for stable, self-consistent N-body orbits with the so
called GAMP method that incorporates stability constraints into the
optimization algorithm. Our searches reveal only small regions of stable
motions in the phase space of three-planet, coplanar configurations. Most
likely, if the planetary masses are in 10-Jupiter-mass range, they may be
stable only if the planets are involved in two- or three-body mean motion
resonances (MMRs). We found that 80% systems found by GAMP that survived 30Myr
backwards integrations, eventually become unstable after 100Myr. It could mean
that the HR 8799 system undergo a phase of planet-planet scattering. We test a
hypothesis that the less certain detection of the innermost object is due to a
blending effect. In such a case, two-planet best-fit systems are mostly stable,
on quasi-circular orbits and close to the 5:2 MMR, resembling the

purpose of this work is to explore the possibility that a low-energy component

discrepancy between the ionization rate measured in diffuse and dense
interstellar clouds. We collect the most recent experimental and theoretical
data on the cross sections for the production of H2+ and He+ by electron and
proton impact, and we discuss the available constraints on the cosmic-ray
fluxes in the local interstellar medium. Starting from different extrapolations
at low energies of the demodulated cosmic-ray proton and electron spectra, we
compute the propagated spectra in molecular clouds in the continuous
slowing-down approximation taking into account all the relevant energy loss
processes. The theoretical value of the cosmic-ray ionization rate as a
function of the column density of traversed matter is in agreement with the
observational data only if either the flux of cosmic-ray electrons or of
protons increases at low energies. The most successful models are characterized
by a significant (or even dominant) contribution of the electron component to
the ionization rate, in agreement with previous suggestions. However, the large
spread of cosmic-ray ionization rates inferred from chemical models of
molecular cloud cores remains to be explained. Available data combined with
simple propagation models support the existence of a low-energy component
(below about 100 MeV) of cosmic-ray electrons or protons responsible for the
ionization of molecular cloud cores and dense protostellar envelopes.

schemes, the packets that are not rebuilt at the receiver side are either lost

present contribution aims at demonstrating that Tetrys coding scheme can fill
the gap between real-time applications requirements and full reliability.
Indeed, we show that in several cases, Tetrys can recover lost packets below
one RTT over lossy and best-effort networks. We also show that Tetrys allows to
enable full reliability without delay compromise and as a result: significantly
improves the performance of time constrained applications. For instance, our

King-model profiles are used to measure their individual total magnitudes,
colors, and effective radii. The classic bimodal form of the GC color-magnitude
distribution shows up unambiguously in all the galaxies, allowing an accurate
definition of the mean colors along each of the two sequences as a function of
magnitude (the mass/metallicity relation or MMR). The blue, metal-poor cluster
sequence shows a clearly defined but nonlinear MMR, changing smoothly from a
near-vertical sequence at low luminosity to an increasingly redward slope at
higher luminosity, while the red, metal-rich sequence is nearly vertical at all
luminosities. All the observed features of the present data agree with the
interpretation that the MMR is created primarily by GC self-enrichment, along
the lines of the quantitative model of Bailin and Harris (2009): The
""threshold"" mass at which this effect should become noticeable is near 1
million Solar masses, which is closely consistent with the transition region
that is seen in the data. Correlation of the median half-light radii of the GCs
with other parameters shows that the metal-poor clusters are consistently 17%
larger than those of the metal-rich clusters, at all galactocentric distances
and luminosities. At the same time, cluster size scales with halo location as
r_h ~ R_gc^0.11, indicating that both metallicity and the external tidal
environment play roles in determining the scale size of a given cluster.
Lastly, both the red and blue GC components show metallicity gradients with
galactocentric distance, following Z ~ R_gc^-0.1.

exponential since a classical algorithm without advanced information should
perform an exponential number of function evaluations. In unstructured database

superposition with respect to missed counts and find that a transmission
measurement yields more robust and controllable superposition states than the

the RApid Temporal Survey (RATS) on the Isaac Newton Telescope. It showed high
amplitude (0.3 mag) quasi-periodic oscillations on a timescale of ~20 mins.
Further observations made using the Nordic Optical Telescope showed it to be ~4
mag brighter than in the discovery images. These photometric observations,
together with radial velocity data taken using the William Herschel Telescope,
point to an orbital period of ~90 mins. These data suggest that RAT J1953+1859
is a dwarf novae of the SU UMa type. What makes RAT J1953+1859 unusual is that
it is the first such system to be discovered as a result of high amplitude QPOs
during quiescence. This suggests that high-cadence wide-field surveys could be
another means to discover cataclysmic variables as a result of their short

  Chaos",,,,"nlin.CD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Nonlinear time series analyses have suggested that the human
electroencephalogram (EEG) may share statistical and dynamical properties with
chaotic systems. During slow-wave sleep or pathological states like epilepsy,
correlation dimension measurements display low values, while in awake and
attentive subjects, there is not such low dimensionality, and the EEG is more
similar to a stochastic variable. We briefly review these results and contrast
them with recordings in cat cerebral cortex, as well as with theoretical
models. In awake or sleeping cats, recordings with microelectrodes inserted in
cortex show that global variables such as local field potentials (local EEG)
are similar to the human EEG. However, in both cases, neuronal discharges are
highly irregular and exponentially distributed, similar to Poisson stochastic
processes. To attempt reconcile these results, we investigate models of
randomly-connected networks of integrate-and-fire neurons, and also contrast
global (averaged) variables, with neuronal activity. The network displays
different states, such as ""synchronous regular"" (SR) or ""asynchronous
irregular"" (AI) states. In SR states, the global variables display coherent
behavior with low dimensionality, while in AI states, the global activity is
high-dimensionally chaotic with exponentially distributed neuronal discharges,
similar to awake cats. Scale-dependent Lyapunov exponents and epsilon-entropies
show that the seemingly stochastic nature at small scales (neurons) can coexist
with more coherent behavior at larger scales (averages). Thus, we suggest that
brain activity obeys similar scheme, with seemingly stochastic dynamics at
small scales (neurons), while large scales (EEG) display more coherent behavior
or high-dimensional chaos.

scattering and lattice dynamics in single crystals of the relaxor PMN from 10K
to 900K. We observed two distinct types of diffuse scattering. The first is
weak, relatively temperature independent, persists to at least 900 K, and forms
bow-tie-shaped patterns in reciprocal space centered on (h00) Bragg peaks. We
associate this primarily with chemical short-range order. The second is strong,
temperature dependent, and forms butterfly-shaped patterns centered on (h00)
Bragg peaks. This diffuse scattering has been attributed to the PNR because it
responds to an electric field and vanishes near Td ~ 620K when measured with
thermal neutrons. Surprisingly, it vanishes at 420K when measured with cold
neutrons, which provide ~4 times superior energy resolution. That this onset
temperature depends on the instrumental energy resolution demands a
reassessment of the Burns temperature Td. Neutron backscattering measurements
made with 300 times better energy resolution confirm the onset temperature of
420+/-20K. The energy width of the diffuse scattering is resolution limited,
indicating that the PNR are static on timescales of at least 2 nsec. Transverse
acoustic (TA) phonon lifetimes are temperature independent up to 900K for q <
0.2 1/A. This motivates a physical picture in which sufficiently
long-wavelength TA phonons average over the PNR; only those TA phonons having
wavelengths comparable to the size of the PNR are affected. The PMN lattice
constant changes by less than 0.001 Angstroms below 300K, but expands rapidly
at a rate of 2.5x10^-5 1/K at high temperature. The regimes of low and high
thermal expansion bracket the revised value of Td, which suggests the anomalous
thermal expansion results from the condensation of static PNR.

function of temperature, applied magnetic field, and pressure. The data reveal
that there is only one transition observed over the entire range of variables
explored, which is a combined magnetic and structural transformation between
the paramagnetic to ferromagnetic phases (Tc~255 K for this composition). The
structural part of the transition is associated with an expansion of the
hexagonal unit cell in the direction of the a- and b-axes and a contraction of
the c-axis as the FM phase is formed, which originates from an increase in the
intra-layer metal-metal bond distance. The application of pressure is found to
have an adverse effect on the formation of the FM phase since pressure opposes
the expansion of the lattice and hence decreases Tc. The application of a
magnetic field, on the other hand, has the expected effect of enhancing the FM
phase and increasing Tc. We find that the substantial range of
temperature/field/pressure coexistence of the PM and FM phases observed is due
to compositional variations in the sample. In-situ high temperature diffraction
measurements were carried out to explore this issue, and reveal a coexisting
liquid phase at high temperatures that is the origin of this variation. We show
that this range of coexisting phases can be substantially reduced by
appropriate heat treatment to improve the sample homogeneity.

s-1) mid-infrared H2 emission towards the galaxy-wide collision in the
Stephan's Quintet (SQ) galaxy group. This discovery was followed by the
detection of more distant H2-luminous extragalactic sources, with almost no
spectroscopic signatures of star formation. These observations set molecular
gas in a new context where one has to describe its role as a cooling agent of
energetic phases of galaxy evolution. Aims. The SQ postshock medium is observed
to be multiphase, with H2 gas coexisting with a hot (~ 5 10^6 K), X-ray
emitting plasma. The surface brightness of H2 lines exceeds that of the X-rays
and the 0-0 S(1) H2 linewidth is ~ 900 km s-1, of the same order of the
collision velocity. These observations raise three questions we propose to
answer: (i) Why H2 is present in the postshock gas ? (ii) How can we account
for the H2 excitation ? (iii) Why H2 is a dominant coolant ? Methods. We
consider the collision of two flows of multiphase dusty gas. Our model
quantifies the gas cooling, dust destruction, H2 formation and excitation in
the postshock medium. Results. (i) The shock velocity, the post-shock
temperature and the gas cooling timescale depend on the preshock gas density.
The collision velocity is the shock velocity in the low density volume filling
intercloud gas. This produces a ~ 5 10^6 K, dust-free, X-ray emitting plasma.
The shock velocity is smaller in clouds. We show that gas heated to
temperatures less than 10^6 K cools, keeps its dust content and becomes H2
within the SQ collision age (~ 5 10^6 years). (ii) Since the bulk kinetic
energy of the H2 gas is the dominant energy reservoir, we consider that the H2
emission is powered by the dissipation of kinetic turbulent energy. (Abridged)

of self-gravitating gas in the centers of proto-galaxies. Such gas
accumulations are prone to non-axisymmetric instabilities, as in the well-known
Maclaurin sequence of rotating ellipsoids, which are accompanied by a
catastrophic loss of angular momentum (J). Self-gravitating gas is also
intuitively associated with star formation. However, recent simulations of the
infall process display highly turbulent continuous flows. We propose that
J-transfer, which enables the inflow, also suppresses fragmentation.
Inefficient J loss by the gas leads to decay of turbulence, triggering global
instabilities and renewed turbulence driving. Flow regulated in this way is
stable against fragmentation, whilst staying close to the instability threshold
for bar formation -- thick self-gravitating disks are prone to global
instabilities before they become unstable locally. On smaller scales, the
fraction of gravitationally unstable matter swept up by shocks in such a flow
is a small and decreasing function of the Mach number. We conclude
counterintuitively that gas able to cool down to a small fraction of its virial
temperature will not fragment as it collapses. This provides a venue for
supermassive black holes to form via direct infall, without the intermediary
stage of forming a star cluster. Some black holes could have formed or grown in
massive halos at low redshifts. Thus the fragmentation is intimately related to
J redistribution within the system: it is less dependent on the molecular and
metal cooling but is conditioned by the ability of the flow to develop virial,
supersonic turbulence.

Space Telescope imaging of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. The galaxies we study
are selected with the Lyman-break drop-out technique, using galaxies which are
B-,V-, and i-drops, which effectively selects UV bright starbursting galaxies
between z=4 and z=6. Our primary observational finding is that starbursting
galaxies at z>4 have a diversity in structure, with roughly 30% appearing
distorted and asymmetric, while the majority are smooth and apparently
undisturbed systems. We utilize several methods to compute the inferred
assembly rates for these distorted early galaxies including utilising the CAS
system and pair counts. Overall, we find a similar fraction of galaxies which
are in pairs as the fraction which have a distorted structure. Using the CAS
methodology, and our best-estimate for merger time-scales, we find that the
total number of inferred effective mergers for M_{*} > 10^9-10 M_sol galaxies

a remarkable scaling relation between the concentration of light and their
half-light radii, revealing the earliest known galaxy scaling relationship, and
demonstrating that some galaxies at z>4 are likely in a relaxed state. Systems
which are asymmetric do not display a correlation between size and half-light
radii, and are generally larger than the symmetric smooth systems. The
time-scale for the formation of these smooth systems is 0.5-1 Gyr, suggesting

properties of galactic disks between regions in which the interstellar medium
is single phase or two phase. Our study is motivated by observations of HI in
extended galactic disks which indicate velocity dispersions of nonthermal
origin, suggesting that turbulence in the gas may be contributing significantly
to the observed dispersion. To address this, we have implemented a shearing-box
framework within the FLASH code. The new code was used to perform local
simulations of galactic disks that incorporate differential rotation,
self-gravity, vertical stratification, hydrodynamics and cooling. These
simulations explore plausible mechanisms for driving turbulent motions via the
thermal and self-gravitational instabilities coupling to differential rotation.
Where a two-phase medium develops, gravitational angular momentum transporting
stresses are much greater, creating a possible mechanism for transferring
energy from galactic rotation to turbulence. In simulations where the disk
conditions do not trigger the formation of a two-phase medium, it is found that
perturbations to the flow damp without leading to a sustained mechanism for
driving turbulence. The differing angular momentum transport properties of the
single- and two-phase regimes of the disk suggest that a significant,
dynamically motivated division can be drawn between the two, even when this
division occurs far outside the star formation cutoff in a galactic disk.

imaging. We use optical/NIR colour(s) to infer effective stellar mass-to-light
ratios (M/L) at each pixel, which are then multiplied by the surface brightness
to obtain the local stellar surface mass density. We build look-up tables to
express M/L as a function of colour(s) by marginalizing over a Monte Carlo
library of 50,000 stellar population synthesis (SPS) models by Charlot &
Bruzual (2007), which include a revised prescription for the TP-AGB stellar
evolutionary phase, with a wide range of dust exinctions. In order to extract
reliable flux and colour information at any position in the galaxy, we perform
a median adaptive smoothing of the images that preserves the highest possible
spatial resolution. As the most practical and robust, and hence fiducial
method, we express the M/L in the H band as a function of (g-i) and (i-H).
Stellar mass maps computed in this way have a typical accuracy of 30 per cent
or less at any given pixel, determined from the scatter in the models. We
compare maps obtained with our fiducial method with those derived using other
combinations of bandpasses and the old BC03 TP-AGB prescription. Finally, we
compare total stellar mass estimates obtained by integrating resolved mass maps
with those obtained with unresolved photometry. In galaxies with evident dust
lanes, unresolved estimates may miss up to 40 per cent of the total stellar
mass because dusty regions are strongly under-represented in the luminous
fluxes.

extremal black holes. Within Sen's quantum entropy function framework and
focusing on extremal black holes with an intermediate AdS3 region, we identify
an infinite family of semi-classical AdS2 geometries which can contribute
effects of order exp(S_0/c), where S_0 is the Bekenstein-Hawking-Wald entropy
and c is an integer greater than one. These solutions lift to the extremal
limit of the SL(2,Z) family of BTZ black holes familiar from the ""black hole
Farey tail"". We test this understanding in N=4 string vacua, where exact dyon
degeneracies are known to be given by Fourier coefficients of Siegel modular
forms. We relate the sum over poles in the Siegel upper half plane to the Farey
tail expansion, and derive a ""Farey tale"" expansion for the dyon partition
function. Mathematically, this provides a (formal) lift from Hilbert modular
forms to Siegel modular forms with a pole at the diagonal divisor.

probe the neutral hydrogen absorption signatures of early structures along the

21cm tomography observations, and provides information on the temperature as
well as the ionization state of the intergalactic medium (IGM). We use a
radiative transfer simulation to investigate the 21cm forest signals during the
epoch of reionization. We first confirmed that the optical depth and equivalent
width (EW) are good representations of the ionization and thermal state of the
IGM. The features selected by their relative optical depth are excellent
tracers of ionization fields, while those selected by absolute optical depth
are very sensitive to the IGM temperature, so the IGM temperature information
could potentially be extracted, thus breaking a degeneracy in 21cm tomographic
observation. From the distributions of EWs and the number evolution of
absorbers and leakers with different EWs, we see clearly the cosmological
evolution of ionization state of the IGM. The number density of potentially
observable features decreases rapidly with increasing gas temperature. The
sensitivity of the proposed EW statistic to the IGM temperature makes it a
unique and potentially powerful probe of reionization. Missing small-scale
structures, such as small filaments and minihalos that are unresolved in our
current simulation, and lack of an accurate calculation of the IGM temperature,
however, likely have rendered the presented signals quantitatively inaccurate.
Finally we discuss the requirements of the background radio sources for such
observations, and find that signals with equivalent widths larger than 1kHz are
hopeful to be detected.(Abridged)

We study the detection limits on PNG from the surveys of the LAMOST telescope.
The cases of the main galaxy survey, the luminous red galaxy (LRG) survey, and
the quasar survey of different magnitude limits are considered. We find that
the MAIN1 sample (i.e. the main galaxy survey with one magnitude deeper than
the SDSS main galaxy survey, or r<18.8) could only provide very weak constraint
on PNG. For the MAIN2 sample (r<19.8) and the LRG survey, the 2\sigma (95.5%)

we find that the 2\sigma limit for |f_{NL}| is between 50 and 103, depending on
the magnitude limit of the survey. With Planck-like priors on cosmological
parameters, the quasar survey with g<21.65 would improve the constraints to
|f_{NL}|<43 (2\sigma). We also discuss the possibility of further tightening
the constraint by using the relative bias method proposed by Seljak(2008).

The mean profiles and concentration indices show a strong and smooth dependence

galaxy types, mean H alpha and R-band profiles are very similar. Mean profiles
within a given type are remarkably constant even given wide ranges in galaxy
luminosity and size. SBc, SBbc and particularly SBb galaxies have profiles that
are markedly different from those of unbarred galaxies. H alpha emission from
SBb galaxies is studied in detail; virtually all show resolved central
components and concentrations of star formation at or just outside the bar-end

R-band light, i.e. stellar mass is building at approximately constant
morphology, with no strong evidence for outer truncation or inside-out disk
formation. (Abridged.)

profiles, and atomic gas masses of those galaxies in our H alpha Galaxy Survey,
a representative sample of the local Universe of 327 disk galaxies, that have
close companion galaxies, in comparison with a matched control sample of
galaxies without companions. We find that the presence of a close companion
raises the star formation rate by a factor of just under two, while increasing
hardly at all the equivalent width of the H alpha emission. This means that
although statistically galaxies with close companions form stars at a higher
rate, they do this over extended periods of time, and not as bursts. We find no
significant increase in the central concentration of the star formation as a
result of the presence of a close companion. The fraction of truly interacting
or merging galaxies is very small in the local Universe, at around 2%, and
possibly 4% of bright galaxies. Most of these interacting galaxies currently
have unremarkable star formation properties. We also study the properties of
the Survey galaxies with the most extreme values for star formation indicators
such as rate, equivalent width, star formation rate per area, and gas depletion
timescale. We find that each of these indicators favors a different subset of
galaxies, and use this information to discuss critically the possible
definitions of the term starburst to describe galaxies with enhanced star
formation activity. We conclude that no one starburst definition can be devised
which is objective and generally discriminant. Unless one restricts the use of
the term ""starburst"" to a very small number of galaxies, the term will continue
to be used for a heterogeneous and wide-ranging collection of objects with no
physical basis for their classification as starburst.

Topological vector currents exist because of the P-symmetry violation of the
weak interaction. Kicks and helicity are both objects that transform as
pseudovectors and thus require P-symmetry violation to manifest themselves.
This symmetry argument is supported numerically; topological currents provide
transfer enough momentum to describe even the largest of kicks and can generate
large toroidal fields that create helicity. An observational signature of
currents is a faint left circular polarization in the X-rays in the wake of the

is based on the introduction of statistical properties of the scattering matrix
and on a second-quantization many-body description. From a quantitative point
of view, statistical properties are obtained by means of Monte Carlo
simulations on a ensemble of different configurations of injected states,
requiring the solution of the Poisson-Schrodinger equation on a
three-dimensional grid, with the non-equilibrium Green functions formalism. In
a series of example, we show that failure to consider the effects of Coulomb
interaction on noise leads to a gross overestimation of the noise spectrum of
quasi-one dimensional devices.

Our most important finding is that the correlation between UHECRs and AGNs is
too strong to be explained purely by AGNs tracing the large scale distribution
of matter, indicating that (barring the correlation being a statistical fluke)
some substantial fraction of UHECRs are produced by AGNs. We also find that

conductor, or a conducting filament, and shows that the corresponding linear
charge density slowly tends to uniformity as the inverse of the logarithm of a
characteristic parameter. An alternative derivation of this result directly
based on energy minimization is developed. These results are based on a general
asymptotic analysis of the electric field components and potential near a
charge filament in the limit of vanishing diameter. It is found that the
divergent parts of the radial and azimuthal electric field components, as well
as the electric potential, are determined by the local charge density while the
axial component is determined by the local dipole density. For a straight
filament, these results reduce to those for conducting needles discussed in the
literature. For curved filaments, there is an additional length scale in the
problem arising from the finite radius of curvature of the filament.
Remarkably, the basic uniformity result survives the added complications, which
include an azimuthal variation in the surface charge density of the filament.
These uniformity results yield an asymptotic formula for the capacitance of a
curved filament that generalizes Maxwell's original result. The examples of a
straight filament with uniform and linearly varying charge densities, as well
as a circular filament with a uniform charge distribution, are treated
analytically and found to be in agreement with the results of the general
analysis. Numerical calculations illustrating the slow convergence of linear
charge distribution to uniformity for an elliptical filament are presented, and
an interactive computer program implementing and animating the numerical

average flux of ~3 x 10^{-6} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1}, for energies above 100
MeV. The gamma-ray flux is variable, with strong, distinct,
symmetrically-shaped flares for which the flux increases by a factor of several
on a time scale of about three days. This variability indicates a compact
emission region, and the requirement that the source is optically thin to
pair-production implies relativistic beaming with Doppler factor delta > 8,
consistent with the values inferred from VLBI observations of superluminal
expansion (delta ~ 25). The observed gamma-ray spectrum is not consistent with
a simple power-law, but instead steepens strongly above ~2 GeV, and is well
described by a broken power-law with photon indices of ~2.3 and ~3.5 below and
above the break, respectively. This is the first direct observation of a break
in the spectrum of a high luminosity blazar above 100 MeV, and it is likely
direct evidence for an intrinsic break in the energy distribution of the
radiating particles. Alternatively, the spectral softening above 2 GeV could be
due to gamma-ray absorption via photon-photon pair production on the soft X-ray
photon field of the host AGN, but such an interpretation would require the
dissipation region to be located very close (less than 100 gravitational radii)
to the black hole, which would be inconsistent with the X-ray spectrum of the

performance of the primary user, if the interference margin is carefully
chosen. The key idea is to exploit the spatial dimensions to orthogonalize
users and hence minimize interference. However, unlike the time and frequency
dimensions, there is no universal basis for the set of all multi-dimensional
spatial channels, which motivated the development of OSO. On one hand, OSO can
be viewed as a multi-user diversity scheme that exploits the channel randomness
and independence. On the other hand, OSO can be interpreted as an opportunistic
interference alignment scheme, where the interference from multiple secondary
users is opportunistically aligned at the direction that is orthogonal to the
primary user's signal space. In the case of multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) channels, the OSO scheme can be interpreted as ""riding the peaks"" over
the eigen-channels, and ill-conditioned MIMO channel, which is traditionally
viewed as detrimental, is shown to be beneficial with respect to the sum

While the key idea of Game Theory is Nash Equilibrium, it is critical to

Equilibrium. In this paper we present a dynamic programming implemented method
to compute 2x2 non-cooperative finite resource allocation game's payoff matrix.
We assume in one population there exists two types of individuals, aggressive
and non-aggressive and each individual has equal and finite resource. The
strength of individual could be described by a function of resource consumption
in discrete development stages. Each individual undergoes logistic growth hence
we divide the development into three stages: initialization, quasilinear growth
and termination. We first discuss the theoretical frame of how to dynamic
programming to calculate payoff matrix then give three numerical examples
representing three different types of aggressive individuals and calculate the
payoff matrix for each of them respectively. Based on the numerical payoff
matrix we further investigate the evolutionary stable strategies (ESS) of the
games.

phenomenon, whose effects are visible only outside Einstein's free-falling
elevator. By curving spacetime, General Relativity leaves the smallest systems
free of classical gravitational effects. However, according to the standard
semi-classical treatment, indirect effects of gravity can be experienced inside
the elevator through the well-known mechanism of quantum particle production.
Here we try a different path than the one historically followed: rather than
imposing field quantization on top of a curved manifold, we attempt to upgrade
the equivalence principle and extend it to the quantum phenomena. Therefore, we
consider, and try to realize in a theoretical framework, a stronger version of
the equivalence principle, in which all the effects of gravity are definitely
banned from the elevator and confined to the infra-red. For this purpose, we
introduce infra-red modified commutation relations for the global field
operators (Fourier modes) that allow to reabsorb the time-dependent quadratic
divergence of the vacuum expectation value of the stress-energy tensor. The
proposed modification is effective on length scales comparable to the inverse
curvature and, therefore, does no add any dimensional parameter to the theory.

emissions and matter motions outside the protoneutron star. By performing a
ray-tracing calculation in 3D, we estimate accurately the gravitational
waveforms from anisotropic neutrino emissions. In contrast to the previous work
assuming axisymmetry, we find that the gravitational waveforms vary much more
stochastically because the explosion anisotropies depend sensitively on the
growth of the SASI which develops chaotically in all directions. Our results
show that the gravitational-wave spectrum has its peak near $\sim 100$ Hz,
reflecting the SASI-induced matter overturns of $\sim O(10)$ ms. We point out
that the detection of such signals, possibly visible to the LIGO-class
detectors for a Galactic supernova, could be an important probe into the
long-veiled explosion mechanism.

and spin responses in a two-dimensional extended Hubbard model with the
nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion in the vicinity of its charge-ordering
transition point. In this expansion, we can calculate approximate charge and
spin response functions by systematic inclusion of vertex corrections, from
which we obtain the uniform susceptibility equal to the so-called q-limit of
the response function and the second-order transition point as a divergent
point in the same response function at some finite wave-number vector. It is
shown that the reentrant charge-ordering transition, which has already been
observed in the random-phase approximation (RPA), remains to take place even
though the vertex corrections are included beyond the RPA. As a prominent
effect of the vertex corrections, we find that the uniform spin susceptibility
is enhanced due to charge fluctuations developing toward the charge-ordering

susceptibility with the experimental results on the quasi-two-dimensional
organic conductors, together with its explanation in the Landau's Fermi-liquid

They showed that star-forming regions and young stars have large peculiar
motions, as large as 30 km/s with complex structures. Such a large peculiar
motion is incompatible with the prediction of the standard theory of
quasi-stationary spiral arms. We use a high-resolution, self-consistent
N-body+hydrodynamical simulation to explore how the spiral arms are formed and
maintained, and how star-forming regions move. We found that arms are not
quasi-stationary but transient and recurrent, as suggested in alternative
theories of spiral structures. Because of this transient nature of the spiral
arms, star-forming regions exhibit a trend of large and complex non-circular
motions, which is qualitatively consistent with the VLBI observations. Owing to
this large non-circular motion, a kinematically estimated gas map of our Galaxy
has a large systematic errors of ~2-3 kpc in the distance from the Sun.

(1) The Fe abundances derived from the high resolution spectra are in good
agreement with the metallicity estimated from the Ca triplet lines in low
resolution spectra. The lack of stars with [Fe/H]=<-3 in Sextans, found by
previous estimates from the Ca triplet, is confirmed by our measurements,
although we note that high resolution spectroscopy for a larger sample of stars
will be necessary to estimate the true fraction of stars with such low
metallicity. (2) While one object shows an overabundance of Mg (similar to
Galactic halo stars), the Mg/Fe ratios of the remaining five stars are similar
to the solar value. This is the first time that low Mg/Fe ratios at such low
metallicities have been found in a dwarf spheroidal galaxy. No evidence for
over-abundances of Ca and Ti are found in these five stars, though the
measurements for these elements are less certain. Possible mechanisms to
produce low Mg/Fe ratios, with respect to that of Galactic halo stars, are
discussed. (3) Ba is under-abundant in four objects, while the remaining two
stars exhibit large and moderate excesses of this element. The abundance
distribution of Ba in this galaxy is similar to that in the Galactic halo,
indicating that the enrichment of heavy elements, probably by the r-process,
started at metallicities [Fe/H] < -2.5, as found in the Galactic halo.

disorder driven phase separation in the low temperature state is noticed in the
magnetic, magnetoresistance, and dielectric measurements which is attributed to
the oxygen deficiency in the compound. A considerable magnetodielectric (MD)
effect is noticed close to room temperature at 280 K which is fascinating for
technological applications. The strongest MD effect observed in between 180 K
and 200 K is found to be uncorrelated with magnetoresistance but it is
suggested to be due to a number of intricate processes occuring in this
temperature range which includes paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic transition,
incommensurate to commensurate charge ordering and orbital ordering. The
strongest MD effect seems to emerge from the high sensitivity of the
incommensurate state to the external perturbation such as external magnetic
field. The results propose the possible magnetoelectric coupling in the charge

We work
within the inverse amplitude method to one loop in SU(2) ChPT and analyze the
consequences that all chiral logarithms cancel out in the rho-channel, while
they do not cancel for the sigma case, and how they strongly influence the
properties of this latter resonance. Our results confirm and explain the
different behavior of the sigma and rho poles for NC not far from 3, but we
extend the analysis to very large NC, where the behavior of these two
resonances is re-analyzed. We note that the rather natural requirement of
consistency between resonance saturation and unitarization imposes useful
constraints. By looking only at the rho-channel, and within the single
resonance approximation, we find that the masses of the first vector and scalar
meson nonets, invoked in the single resonance approximation, turn out to be
degenerated in the large NC limit. On the contrary we show that, for
sufficiently large NC, the scalar meson evolution lies beyond the applicability
reach of the one-loop inverse amplitude method and if the scalar channel is
also incorporated in the analysis, it may lead, in some cases, to
phenomenologically inconsistent results.

the emission rate and the detection cross section, including localization and
Lamb-Mossbauer terms, cannot be predicted in quantum mechanics and have to be

Magnetization measurements are not a simple tool to use for the
characterisation of the new family of Fe-based superconductors because magnetic
impurities can be easily formed during the preparation procedure and may affect
the magnetic signal. In spite of this problem bulk magnetization measurements,
properly treated, may give very useful information. In the undoped samples we
gathered the main aspects of the physical behavior of the 1111 phase, i.e. the
onset of the Spin Density Wave (SDW), the antiferromagnetic ordering at the Sm
sublattice and the susceptibility increase with increasing temperature above
the SDW temperature, and, in addition, we were able to estimate the Pauli
contribution to susceptibility and therein the Wilson ratio both for LaFeAsO
and SmFeAsO compounds, and the amplitude of the jump at the SDW temperature. In
the doped samples, while the presence of magnetic signals due to impurities is
dominating in the normal state, the superconducting behavior may be clearly
observed and studied. In particular, in the Sm-1111 superconducting sample the
coexistence-competition between superconductivity and antiferromagnetic
ordering of the Sm ions was clearly observed.

turn stringent, the sensor's messaging policy should be designed anew. What are
the good causal messaging policies ? What should message packets contain ? What
is the lowest possible distortion in a causal estimate at the supervisor ? Is
Delta sampling better than periodic sampling ? We answer these questions under
an idealized model of the network and the assumption of perfect measurements at
the sensor. For a scalar, linear diffusion process, we study the problem of
choosing the causal sampling times that will give the lowest aggregate squared
error distortion. We stick to finite-horizons and impose a hard upper bound on
the number of allowed samples. We cast the design as a problem of choosing an
optimal sequence of stopping times. We reduce this to a nested sequence of
problems each asking for a single optimal stopping time. Under an unproven but
natural assumption about the least-square estimate at the supervisor, each of
these single stopping problems are of standard form. The optimal stopping times
are random times when the estimation error exceeds designed envelopes. For the
case where the state is a Brownian motion, we give analytically: the shape of
the optimal sampling envelopes, the shape of the envelopes under optimal Delta
sampling, and their performances. Surprisingly, we find that Delta sampling
performs badly. Hence, when the rate constraint is a hard limit on the number
of samples over a finite horizon, we should should not use Delta sampling.

investigated in our study is: given a constraint on the fixpoint configuration,
does there exist a network that is robust with respect to it and, if so, what
is its structure? We demonstrate both explicit constructions of robust networks

Hamiltonian constraint in the spatially flat FRW model by two approaches
different from that of the Euclidean term. One of the approaches is very
similar to the treatment of the Lorentz part of Hamiltonian in loop quantum
gravity and hence inherits more features from the full theory. Two symmetric
Hamiltonian constraint operators are constructed respectively in the improved
scheme. Both of them are shown to have the correct classical limit by the
semiclassical analysis. In the loop quantum cosmological model with a massless

It turns out that the classical big bang is again replaced by a quantum bounce

external convergence. We identify a considerable degeneracy between the density
profile slope and the anisotropy parameter, which largely increases the

single-molecule junction is modeled by a quantum dot, coupled to electron
reservoirs via two leads. When the electron is on the dot, it is coupled to a
single harmonic oscillator of frequency $\omega_0$. At zero temperature, the
resonance peak in the linear-response conductance always narrows down due to
the coupling with the vibrational mode. However, this narrowing down is given
by the Franck-Condon factor only for narrow resonances. Contrary to some claims
in the literature, the linear-response conductance does not exhibit any
side-bands at zero temperature. Small side-bands, of order $\exp [-\beta \hbar
\omega_0]$, do arise at finite temperatures. The single-particle density of
states exhibits discontinuities and logarithmic singularities at the
frequencies corresponding to the opening of the inelastic channels, due to the
imaginary and real parts of the self-energy. The same singularities also
generate discontinuities and logarithmic divergences in the differential
conductance at and around the inelastic thresholds. These discontinuities
usually involve upwards steps, but these steps become negative within a rather
narrow range of the elastic transparency of the junction. This range shrinks
further as the the excitation energy exceeds the bare resonance width.

energetics is systematically studied for a wide range of coverage and
adsorption sites. In the coverage range $0<\Theta<1.0, the most stable among
all possible adsorption sites is the on-surface fcc site followed by the hcp
site, and the binding energy increases with the coverage, thus indicating the
higher stability of on-surface adsorption and a tendecy to the formation of H
islands (clusters) when increasing the coverage within the region
$0<\Theta<1.0. The on-surface diffusion path energetics of atomic hydrogen, as
well as the activation barriers for hydrogen penetration from the on-surface to
the subsurface sites, are also presented at low coverage. At high coverage of
$1.00<\Theta<2.0, it is found that the coadsorption configuration with 1.0
monolayer of H's residing on the surface fcc sites and the remaining monolayer
of H's occupying the subsurface tetra-I sites is most energetically favourable.

the conditions under which probabilities may be assigned to sets of quantum
histories. A variety of conditions have been proposed, but the most important
one is decoherence, which means that the interference between every pair of
histories in the set is zero. Weaker conditions have been considered, such as
consistency, or linear positivity, but these are ruled out by the requirement
of consistent composition of subsystems, proposed by Diosi. Here we propose a
new condition which we call partial decoherence, and is the requirement that
every history has zero interference with its negation. This is weaker than
decoherence and stronger than linear positivity (but its relation to
consistency is less simply defined -- it is neither stronger nor weaker). Most
importantly, it satisfies the Diosi condition. A strengthened Diosi condition
is proposed, which partial decoherence narrowly fails, due to an unusual
property of inhomogeneous histories. In an appendix an example is given of a
set of histories which are consistent but not decoherent.

during the first year of LIGO's fifth science run. GW strain upper limits and
model-dependent GW emission energy upper limits are estimated for individual
bursts using a variety of simulated waveforms. We find upper limit estimates on
the model-dependent isotropic GW emission energies (at a nominal distance of 10
kpc) between 3x10^45 and 9x10^52 erg depending on waveform type, detector
antenna factors and noise characteristics at the time of the burst. These upper
limits are within the theoretically predicted range of some SGR models. We also
propose a new method which extends the initial SGR burst search, exploring the
possibility that SGR sources emit similarly in GWs from burst to burst by
""stacking"" potential GW signals. We show that gains in GW energy sensitivity of
N^{1/2} are possible, where N is the number of stacked SGR bursts. Estimated

which is responsible for the thermal acceleration of the wind. We analyze winds
with polar magnetic field intensities ranging from 1 to 20G. We show that the
wind structure presents characteristics that are similar to the solar coronal
wind. The steady-state magnetic field topology for all cases is similar,
presenting a configuration of helmet streamer-type, with zones of closed field
lines and open field lines coexisting. Higher magnetic field intensities lead
to faster and hotter winds. The increase of the field intensity generates a
larger dead zone in the wind, i. e., the closed loops that inhibit matter to
escape from latitudes lower than ~45 degrees extend farther away from the star.
The Lorentz force leads naturally to a latitude-dependent wind. We show that by
increasing the density and maintaining B0=20G, the system recover back to
slower and cooler winds. For a fixed gamma, we show that the key parameter in
determining the wind velocity profile is the beta-parameter at the coronal
base. Therefore, there is a group of magnetized flows that would present the
same terminal velocity despite of its thermal and magnetic energy densities, as
long as the plasma-beta parameter is the same. This degeneracy, however, can be
removed if we compare other physical parameters of the wind, such as the
mass-loss rate. We analyze the influence of gamma in our results and we show
that it is also important in determining the wind structure. (Abridged)

there are infinite number of families of FGSs in the semi-infinite gap and

origin of solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The aim of this paper is to
explore to what extent this mechanism can account for the initiation of CMEs in
the global context. A simplified MHD model for the global coronal magnetic
field evolution in response to flux emergence and shearing by large-scale
surface motions is described and motivated. Using automated algorithms for
detecting flux ropes and ejections in the global magnetic model, the effects of
key simulation parameters on the formation of flux ropes and the number of
ejections are considered, over a 177-day period in 1999. These key parameters
include the magnitude and sign of magnetic helicity emerging in active regions,
and coronal diffusion. The number of flux ropes found in the simulation at any
one time fluctuates between about 28 and 48, sustained by the emergence of new
bipolar regions, but with no systematic dependence on the helicity of these
regions. However, the emerging helicity does affect the rate of flux rope
ejections, which doubles from 0.67 per day if the bipoles emerge untwisted to
1.28 per day in the run with greatest emerging twist. The number of ejections
in the simulation is also increased by 20%-30% by choosing the majority sign of
emerging bipole helicity in each hemisphere, or by halving the turbulent
diffusivity in the corona. For reasonable parameter choices, the model produces
approximately 50% of the observed CME rate. This indicates that the formation
and loss of equilibrium of flux ropes may be a key element in explaining a
significant fraction of observed CMEs.

word-of-mouth processes is that of homogeneous mixing: at any time, the
individuals making up the market are uniformly distributed in space. When the
geographical parameters of the market, such as its area extension, become
important, the movement of individuals must be explicitly taken into account.
The authors introduce a model for a ""micro-level"" process for the diffusion of
an innovative product, based on a word-of-mouth mechanism, and they explicitly
consider the inhomogeneity of markets and the spatial extent of the
geographical region where the process takes place. This results in an
unexpected behaviour of macro (aggregate) level measurable quantities. The
authors study the particular case of the pre-launch stage, where a product is
first presented to the market through free sample distribution. The first
triers of the samples then inform the other potential customers via
word-of-mouth; additional advertising is absent. The authors find an unexpected
general failure of the word-of-mouth mechanism for high market densities and
they obtain quantitative results for the optimal sampling policy. By
introducing a threshold to discriminate between individuals who will purchase
and those who will not purchase according to their individual goodwill, they
calculate the length of the pre-launch campaign and the final goodwill as a
function of the firm's expenditure. These results are applied to a set of major
US urban areas.

show that partly obscured disk-like BLRs of dbp emitters (AGN with double-peak

BH masses for AGN with shifted broad balmer emission lines selected from SDSS.
We find that the BH masses calculated from M-sigma relation are systematically
larger than virial BH masses for the selected objects, even after the
correction of internal reddening effects in BLRs. The smaller virial BH masses
than BH masses from M-sigma relation for objects with shifted broad emission
lines are coincident with what we expect from the partly obscured accretion

used to realize and study quasi-one-dimensional superconductors. However,
measurement of the linear resistance of these nanowires have been inconclusive
in determining the low-temperature behavior of phase-slip fluctuations, both
quantal and thermal. Thus, we are motivated to study the nonlinear
current-voltage characteristics in current-biased nanowires and the stochastic
dynamics of superconductive-resistive switching, as a way of probing phase-slip
events. In particular, we address the question: Can a single phase-slip event
occurring somewhere along the wire--during which the order-parameter fluctuates
to zero--induce switching, via the local heating it causes? We explore this and
related issues by constructing a stochastic model for the time-evolution of the
temperature in a nanowire whose ends are maintained at a fixed temperature. We
derive the corresponding master equation as tool for evaluating and analyzing
the mean switching time at a given value of current. The model indicates that
although, in general, several phase-slip events are necessary to induce
switching via a thermal runaway, there is indeed a regime of temperatures and
currents in which a single event is sufficient. We carry out a detailed
comparison of the results of the model with experimental measurements of the
distribution of switching currents, and provide an explanation for the
counter-intuitive broadening of the distribution width that is observed upon
lowering the temperature. Moreover, we identify a regime in which the
experiments are probing individual phase-slip events, and thus offer a way for
exploring the physics of nanoscale quantum tunneling of the superconducting
order parameter.

starburst galaxies (Arp 269, M 82, Mrk 8, NGC 520, NGC 1068, NGC 3079, NGC
3310, NGC 7673) are compared with 54 galaxies at z ~ 1.5 and 46 galaxies at z ~
4 observed in the GOODS-ACS field. The nearby sample is artificially redshifted
to z ~ 1.5 and 4. We compare the simulated galaxy morphologies to real z ~ 1.5
and 4 UV-bright galaxy morphologies. We calculate the Gini coefficient (G), the
second-order moment of the brightest 20% of the galaxy's flux (M_20), and the
Sersic index (n). We explore the use of nonparametric methods with 2D profile
fitting and find the combination of M_20 with n an efficient method to classify
galaxies as having merger, exponential disk, or bulge-like morphologies. When
classified according to G and M_20, 20/30% of real/simulated galaxies at z ~
1.5 and 37/12% at z ~ 4 have bulge-like morphologies. The rest have merger-like
or intermediate distributions. Alternatively, when classified according to the
Sersic index, 70% of the z ~ 1.5 and z ~ 4 real galaxies are exponential disks
or bulge-like with n > 0.8, and ~30% of the real galaxies are classified as
mergers. The artificially redshifted galaxies have n values with ~35% bulge or
exponential at z ~ 1.5 and 4. Therefore, ~20-30% of Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs)
have structures similar to local starburst mergers, and may be driven by
similar processes. We assume merger-like or clumpy star-forming galaxies in the
GOODS field have morphological structure with values n < 0.8 and M_20 > -1.7.
We conclude that Mrk 8, NGC 3079, and NGC 7673 have structures similar to those
of merger-like and clumpy star-forming galaxies observed at z ~ 1.5 and 4.
