factors (tessellations) of the three--sphere. We repeat the standard
computation on spherical space forms (Clifford-Klein spaces) by an improved
technique. The transformation to a simpler form of the spectral expression of
the torsion on spherical factors effected by Ray is shown to be more general
than his derivation implies. It effectively allows the eigenvalues to be
considered as squares of integers, and applies also to trivial twistings. The
analytic torsions compute to algebraic numbers, as expected. In the case of
icosahedral space, the quaternion twisting gives a torsion proportional to the
fundamental unit of Q(5^(1/2)). As well as a direct calculation, the torsions
are obtained from the lens space values by a character inducing procedure.On
tessellations, terms occur due to edge conical singularities.

relaxes back to the average level according to a long-memory kernel $\sim
1/t^{1+\theta}$ with $0 \leq \theta <1$. In the presence of an epidemic-like
process of triggered shocks developing in a cascade of generations at or close
to criticality, this ""bare"" kernel is renormalized into an even slower decaying
response function $\sim 1/t^{1-\theta}$. Surprisingly, this means that the
shorter the memory of the bare kernel (the larger $1+\theta$), the longer the
memory of the response function (the smaller $1-\theta$). Here, we present a
detailed investigation of this paradoxical behavior based on a
generation-by-generation decomposition of the total response function, the use
of Laplace transforms and of ""anomalous"" scaling arguments. The paradox is
explained by the fact that the number of triggered generations grows
anomalously with time at $\sim t^\theta$ so that the contributions of active
generations up to time $t$ more than compensate the shorter memory associated
with a larger exponent $\theta$. This anomalous scaling results fundamentally
from the property that the expected waiting time is infinite for $0 \leq \theta
\leq 1$. The techniques developed here are also applied to the case $\theta >1$
and we find in this case that the total renormalized response is a {\bf
constant} for $t < 1/(1-n)$ followed by a cross-over to $\sim 1/t^{1+\theta}$
for $t \gg 1/(1-n)$.

have identified two different telescope architectures, but with similar optical
designs, that span the range in viable technologies. The architectures are a
telescope with a monolithic primary mirror and two variations of a telescope
with a large segmented primary mirror. This approach provides us with several
pathways to realizing the mission, which will be narrowed to one as our
technology development progresses. The concepts invoke heritage from HST and
JWST design, but also take significant departures from these designs to
minimize complexity, mass, or both.

high-contrast imaging technologies, whether internal to the observatory, or

Local Proceedings of CiE 2008, pp.425-434, 2008] and [K. Tadaki, Proceedings of
LFCS'09, Springer's LNCS, vol.5407, pp.422-440, 2009], where we introduced the
notion of thermodynamic quantities, such as partition function Z(T), free
energy F(T), energy E(T), and statistical mechanical entropy S(T), into AIT. We
then discovered that, in the interpretation, the temperature T equals to the
partial randomness of the values of all these thermodynamic quantities, where
the notion of partial randomness is a stronger representation of the
compression rate by means of program-size complexity. Furthermore, we showed
that this situation holds for the temperature itself as a thermodynamic
quantity, namely, for each of all the thermodynamic quantities above, the
computability of its value at temperature T gives a sufficient condition for T
in (0,1) to be a fixed point on partial randomness. In this paper, we develop
the statistical mechanical interpretation of AIT further and pursue its formal
correspondence to normal statistical mechanics. The thermodynamic quantities in
AIT are defined based on the halting set of an optimal computer, which is a
universal decoding algorithm used to define the notion of program-size
complexity. We show that there are infinitely many optimal computers which give
completely different sufficient conditions in each of the thermodynamic
quantities in AIT. We do this by introducing the notion of composition of
computers into AIT, which corresponds to the notion of composition of systems
in normal statistical mechanics.

derived using only protein interaction network structure should define protein
modules with similar biological roles. We investigate the link between
biological modules and network communities in yeast and its relationship to the
scale at which we probe the network.
  Results: Our results demonstrate that the functional homogeneity of
communities depends on the scale selected, and that almost all proteins lie in
a functionally homogeneous community at some scale. We judge functional
homogeneity using a novel test and three independent characterizations of
protein function, and find a high degree of overlap between these measures. We
show that a high mean clustering coefficient of a community can be used to
identify those that are functionally homogeneous. By tracing the community
membership of a protein through multiple scales we demonstrate how our approach
could be useful to biologists focusing on a particular protein.
  Conclusions: We show that there is no one scale of interest in the community
structure of the yeast protein interaction network, but we can identify the
range of resolution parameters that yield the most functionally coherent
communities, and predict which communities are most likely to be functionally
homogeneous.

curvature and the scalar curvature of $M^n$, generalizing estimates given by
Heinz in the case $n=2$ [Math. Annalen 129, 451-454, 1955]. Under the
assumption that $M^n$ has negative Ricci curvature, we also obtain an upper
bound for $\inf_M|A|$, where $|A|$ is the length of the second fundamental
form. As a consequence of this latter estimate one obtains that $\inf |A|=0$
for all entire graphs with negative Ricci curvature in Euclidean space. This
gives a partial answer to a question raised by Smith-Xavier [Invent. Math. 90,
443-450, 1987].

competition or balance between lowering the energy and increasing the entropy,
or at least the product of the temperature and entropy. This is remarkably
similar to the Taoist concept of yin, a downward influence, and yang, an upward
influence, where harmony is established by balancing yin and yang. Entropy is
due to structure, which is largely determined by core repulsions or particle
size whereas energy is largely determined by longer range attractive
interactions. Here, this balance between energy and entropy or particle size is
traced through the theory of simple fluids, beginning with Andrews and van der
Waals, the subsequent developments of perturbation theory, theories of
correlation functions that are based on the Ornstein-Zernike relation and the
mean spherical approximation, electrolytes, and recent work on ion channels in
biological membranes, where the competition between energy and size gives an
intuitively attractive explanation of the selectivity of cation channels.
Simulations of complex systems, including proteins in aqueous solution, should
be studied to determine the extent to which these concepts are useful for such

aboard the Hinode satellite, the horizontal and vertical fields are derived
from the wavelength-integrated measures of Zeeman-induced linear and circular
polarizations. The quiet intranetwork regions are pervaded by horizontal
magnetic elements. We categorize the horizontal intranetwork magnetic elements
into two types: one is the non-isolated element which is accompanied by the
vertical magnetic elements during its evolution; another is the isolated
element which is not accompanied by the vertical magnetic elements. We identify
446 horizontal intranetwork magnetic elements, among them 87 elements are
isolated and 359 are non-isolated. Quantitative measurements reveal that the
isolated elements have relatively weaker horizontal magnetic fields, almost
equal size, and shorter lifetime comparing with the non-isolated elements. Most
non-isolated horizontal intranetwork magnetic elements are identified to
associate with the emergence of Omega-shaped flux loops. A few non-isolated
elements seem to indicate scenarios of submergence of Omega loops or emergence
of U-like loops. There is a positive correlation between the lifetime and the
size for both the isolated and non-isolated HIFs. It is also found that there
is also positive correlation between the lifetime and the magnetic flux density

correlated between different realizations. As the strength of the magnetic

the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, selected using a reduced proper motion diagram.
Radial velocities come from the SDSS spectra and proper motions from the
light-motion curve catalogue of Bramich et al. (2008). Using a photometric
parallax relation to estimate distances gives us the full phase-space
coordinates. Typical velocity errors are in the range 30-50 km/s. This halo
sample is one of the largest constructed to-date and the disc contamination is
at a level of < 1 per cent. This enables us to calculate the halo velocity
dispersion to excellent accuracy. We find that the velocity dispersion tensor
is aligned in spherical polar coordinates and that (sigma_r, sigma_phi,
sigma_theta) = (143 \pm 2, 82 \pm 2, 77 \pm 2) km/s. The stellar halo exhibits
no net rotation, although the distribution of v_phi shows tentative evidence
for asymmetry. The kinematics are consistent with a mildly flattened stellar
density falling with distance like r^{-3.75}. Using the full phase-space
coordinates, we look for signs of kinematic substructure in the stellar halo.
We find evidence for four discrete overdensities localised in angular momentum
and suggest that they may be possible accretion remnants. The most prominent is
the solar neighbourhood stream previously identified by Helmi et al. (1999),
but the remaining three are new. One of these overdensities is potentially
associated with a group of four globular clusters (NGC5466, NGC6934, M2 and
M13) and raises the possibility that these could have been accreted as part of
a much larger progenitor.

  through improved image-reconstruction algorithms","Submitted to Medical Physics",,"10.1118/1.3232211",,"physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  PURPOSE: We develop a practical, iterative algorithm for image-reconstruction
in under-sampled tomographic systems, such as digital breast tomosynthesis
(DBT).
  METHOD: The algorithm controls image regularity by minimizing the image total
$p$-variation (TpV), a function that reduces to the total variation when
$p=1.0$ or the image roughness when $p=2.0$. Constraints on the image, such as
image positivity and estimated projection-data tolerance, are enforced by
projection onto convex sets (POCS). The fact that the tomographic system is
under-sampled translates to the mathematical property that many widely varied
resultant volumes may correspond to a given data tolerance. Thus the
application of image regularity serves two purposes: (1) reduction of the
number of resultant volumes out of those allowed by fixing the data tolerance,
finding the minimum image TpV for fixed data tolerance, and (2) traditional
regularization, sacrificing data fidelity for higher image regularity. The
present algorithm allows for this dual role of image regularity in
under-sampled tomography.
  RESULTS: The proposed image-reconstruction algorithm is applied to three
clinical DBT data sets. The DBT cases include one with microcalcifications and
two with masses.
  CONCLUSION: Results indicate that there may be a substantial advantage in
using the present image-reconstruction algorithm for microcalcification
imaging.

dominant NIR source was an accretion disk during the soft state. The short
X-ray flares during the soft state were associated with spectral hardening in
X-rays and increasing radio emission indicating jet ejection. The temporal NIR
fading during the X-ray flares, hence, implies a sudden decrease of the

MRI was observed in a liquid metal Taylor-Couette flow at moderate Reynolds
numbers by applying a helical magnetic field. The observation of this helical
MRI (HMRI) was interfered with a significant Ekman pumping driven by solid
end-caps that confined the instability only to a part of the Taylor-Couette
cell. This paper describes the observation of the HMRI in an improved
Taylor-Couette setup with the Ekman pumping significantly reduced by using
split end-caps. The HMRI, which now spreads over the whole height of the cell,
appears much sharper and in better agreement with numerical predictions. By
analyzing various parameter dependencies we conclude that the observed HMRI
represents a self-sustained global instability rather than a noise-sustained

crossover transition from the weak coupling regime at large \xi to strong
coupling at small \xi where \xi is the Fayet--Iliopoulos parameter. We find
that at strong coupling a dual non-Abelian weakly coupled N=2 theory exists
which describes low-energy physics at small \xi. The dual gauge group is
U(N_f-N) and the dual theory has N_f flavors of light dyons, to be compared
with N_f quarks in the original U(N) theory. Both, the original and dual
theories are Higgsed and share the same global symmetry SU(N) x SU(N_f-N) x
U(1), albeit the physical meaning of the SU(N) and SU(N_f-N) factors is
different in the large- and small-\xi regimes. Both regimes support non-Abelian
semilocal strings.
  In each of these two regimes particles that are in the adjoint
representations with respect to one of the factor groups exist in two
varieties: elementary fields and composite states bound by strings. These
varieties interchange upon transition from one regime to the other. We
conjecture that the composite stringy states can be related to Seiberg's M
fields. The bulk duality that we observed translates into a two-dimensional
duality on the world sheet of the non-Abelian strings. At large \xi the
internal dynamics of the semilocal non-Abelian strings is described by the
sigma model of N orientational and (N_f-N) size moduli, while at small \xi the
roles of orientational and size moduli interchange. The BPS spectra of two dual
sigma models (describing confined monopoles/dyons of the bulk theory) coincide.
It would be interesting to trace parallels between the non-Abelian duality we
found and string theory constructions.

kinetic pathway that produces trenches that expose the wetting layer. Adjacent
film steps move simultaneously uphill and downhill relative to the staircase of
atomic steps on the substrate. This step motion thickens the film regions where
steps advance. Where film steps retract, the film thins, eventually exposing
the stable wetting layer. Since our analysis shows that thick Cr films have a
lattice constant close to bulk Cr, we propose that surface and interface stress
provide a possible driving force for the observed morphological instability.
Atomistic simulations and analytic elastic models show that surface and
interface stress can cause a dependence of film energy on thickness that leads
to an instability to simultaneous thinning and thickening. We observe that
de-wetting is also initiated at bunches of substrate steps in two other
systems, Ag/W(110) and Ag/Ru(0001). We additionally describe how Cr films are
converted into patterns of unidirectional stripes as the trenches that expose
the wetting layer lengthen along the W[001] direction. Finally, we observe how

quasilinear diffusion formalism which takes into account the feedback effect of
wave growth on the cosmic ray streaming motion. In particular, the nonresonant
instability that leads to magnetic field amplification in the short wavelength
regime is considered. The linear growth rate is calculated using kinetic theory
for a streaming distribution. We show that the nonresonant instability is
actually driven by a compensating current in the background plasma. The
nonresonant instability can develop into a nonlinear regime generating
turbulence. The saturation of the amplified magnetic fields due to particle
diffusion in the turbulence is derived analytically. It is shown that the
evolution of parallel and perpendicular cosmic-ray pressures is predominantly
determined by nonresonant diffusion. However, the saturation is determined by
resonant diffusion which tends to reduce the streaming motion through pitch
angle scattering. The saturated level can exceed the mean background magnetic
field.

by the supersaturated, two-dimensional gas of C adatoms rather than by direct
exchange between the bulk C and the graphene. At long times, the rate at which

exponentially in time, because momentum leaks out of the central scattering
area. This momentum leakage is also the reason for the spatial exponential
divergence of resonant state. It is by combining the opposite temporal and
spatial behaviors of resonant states that we arrive at our probabilistic
interpretation of these states. The physical need to normalize resonant wave

of sun-like main sequence (~F7-K2V) stars. Indeed, the evolution of rotation
and activity among these stars appears to be so deterministic that their
rotation/activity diagnostics are often utilized as estimators of stellar age.
A primary motivation for the recent interest in improving the ages of
solar-type field dwarfs is in understanding the evolution of debris disks and
planetary systems. Reliable isochronal age-dating for field, solar-type main
sequence stars is very difficult given the observational uncertainties and
multi-Gyr timescales for significant structural evolution. Observationally,
significant databases of activity/rotation diagnostics exist for field
solar-type field dwarfs (mainly from chromospheric and X-ray activity surveys).
But how well can we empirically age-date solar-type field stars using
activity/rotation diagnostics? Here I summarize some recent results for F7-K2
dwarfs from an analysis by Mamajek & Hillenbrand (2008), including an improved
""gyrochronology"" [Period(color, age)] calibration, improved chromospheric
(R'_HK and X-ray (log Lx/Lbol) activity vs. rotation (via Rossby number)
relations, and a chromospheric vs. X-ray activity relation that spans four
orders of magnitude in log Lx/Lbol. Combining these relations, one can produce
predicted chromospheric and X-ray activity isochrones as a function of color

argued that theories with light cosmic strings give rise to a population of
numerous long-lived stable loops, many of which cluster gravitationally in
galaxy halos along with the dark matter. Each cosmic string loop produces a
spectrum of discrete frequencies in a nearly perfect harmonic series, a
fundamental mode and its integer multiples. The gravitational wave signal from
cosmic string loops in our Galactic halo is analyzed numerically and it is
found that the for light strings, the nearest loops typically produce strong
signals which stand out above the confusion noise from Galactic binaries. The
total population of cosmic string loops in the Milky Way also produces a broad
signal that acts as a confusion noise. Both signals are enhanced by the
clustering of loops gravitationally bound to the Galaxy, which significantly
decreases the average distance from the solar system to the nearest loop.
Numerical estimates indicate that for dimensionless string tension G\mu<
10^{-11}, many loops are likely to be found in the Galactic halo. Lighter
strings, down to G\mu=10^{-19}, are detectable by the Laser Interferometer
Space Antenna (LISA). For these light strings, the fundamental and low-order
harmonics of typical loops often lie in the band where LISA is sensitive, 0.1
to 100 mHz. The harmonic nature of the cosmic string loop modes leaves a
distinct spectral signature different from any other known source of

cosmology: it is tiny but nonzero. Sorkin predicted, from the Causet approach
to quantum gravity, that the cosmological constant has quantum fluctuations.
The predicted order of magnitude of the fluctuations agrees with the
subsequently observed value of the cosmological constant. We had earlier
developed an analogy between the cosmological constant of the Universe and the
surface tension of fluid membranes. Here we demonstrate by computer simulations
that the surface tension of a fluid membrane has statistical fluctuations
stemming from its discrete molecular structure. Our analogy enables us to view
these numerical experiments as probing a small and fluctuating cosmological
constant. Deriving insights from our analogy, we show that a fluctuating
cosmological constant is a GENERIC feature of quantum gravity models and is far
more general than the specific context in which it was originally proposed. We
pursue and refine the idea of a fluctuating cosmological constant and work
towards making further testable predictions.

Approaches, the bank's internal model must include the use of internal data,

cannot be based only on historical data but should involve scenario analysis.
Historical internal operational risk loss data have limited ability to predict
future behaviour moreover, banks do not have enough internal data to estimate
low frequency high impact events adequately. Historical external data are
difficult to use due to different volumes and other factors. In addition,
internal and external data have a survival bias, since typically one does not
have data of all collapsed companies. The idea of scenario analysis is to
estimate frequency and severity of risk events via expert opinions taking into
account bank environment factors with reference to events that have occurred
(or may have occurred) in other banks. Scenario analysis is forward looking and
can reflect changes in the banking environment. It is important to not only
quantify the operational risk capital but also provide incentives to business
units to improve their risk management policies, which can be accomplished
through scenario analysis. By itself, scenario analysis is very subjective but
combined with loss data it is a powerful tool to estimate operational risk
losses. Bayesian inference is a statistical technique well suited for combining
expert opinions and historical data. In this paper, we present examples of the
Bayesian inference methods for operational risk quantification.

is a very difficult task, and numerical approximation is unavoidable. The paper
faces the problem by approximating the P-representation of the noisy quantum

with convex semidefinite programming show that the SRM approach gives quite
accurate results. As application, the performance of quadrature amplitude

of the fact that the SRM approach is not optimal and overestimates the error

Sondermann to European contingent products whose underlying asset is modeled
using a GARCH process and show that local risk-minimizing strategies with
respect to the physical measure do exist, even though an associated minimal
martingale measure is only available in the presence of bounded innovations.
More importantly, since those local risk-minimizing strategies are in general
convoluted and difficult to evaluate, we introduce Girsanov-like risk-neutral
measures for the log-prices that yield more tractable and useful results.
Regarding this subject, we focus on GARCH time series models with Gaussian
innovations and we provide specific sufficient conditions that have to do with
the finiteness of the kurtosis, under which those martingale measures are
appropriate in the context of quadratic hedging. When this equivalent
martingale measure is adapted to the price representation we are able to
recover out of it the classical pricing formulas of Duan and Heston-Nandi, as
well as hedging schemes that improve the performance of those proposed in the
literature.

grow logarithmically with the flight distance. This effect is in principle
observable, but too small to serve as a realistic probe of the existence of

X-ray core, consistent with an accreting black hole (BH). We argue that the
majority of them are nuclear BHs, rather than X-ray binaries. The fraction of
galaxies with an X-ray detected nuclear BH is higher (~60 per cent) for
ellipticals and early-type spirals (E to Sb), and lower (~30 per cent) for
late-type spirals (Sc to Sm). There is no preferential association of X-ray
cores with a large-scale bar; in fact, strongly barred galaxies appear to have
slightly lower detection fraction and luminosity for their nuclear X-ray
sources, compared with non-barred or weakly barred galaxies of similar Hubble
types. The cumulative luminosity distribution of the nuclear sources in the
0.3-8 keV band is a power-law with slope ~-0.5, from ~2 x 10^{38} erg/s to
~10^{42} erg/s. The Eddington ratio is lower for ellipticals (L_{X}/L_{Edd} ~
10^{-8}) and higher for late-type spirals (up to L_{X}/L_{Edd} ~ 10^{-4}), but
in all cases, the accretion rate is low enough to be in the
radiatively-inefficient regime. The intrinsic NH is generally low, especially
for the less luminous sources: there appear to be no Type-2 nuclear BHs at
luminosities <~ 10^{39} erg/s. The lack of a dusty torus or of other sources of
intrinsic absorption (e.g., an optically-thick disk wind) may be directly
related to the lack of a standard accretion disk around those faint nuclear
BHs. The fraction of obscured sources increases with the nuclear BH luminosity:
2/3 of the sources with L_{X} > 10^{40} erg/s have a fitted NH > 10^{22}
cm^{-2}. This is contrary to the declining trend of the obscured fraction with
increasing luminosities, observed in more luminous AGN and quasars.

collisions collected with a minimum-bias trigger at the Tevatron Collider with
the CDF II experiment. The inclusive charged particle transverse momentum
differential cross section is measured, with improved precision, over a range
about ten times wider than in previous measurements. The former modeling of the
spectrum appears to be incompatible with the high particle momenta observed.
The dependence of the charged particle transverse momentum on the event
particle multiplicity is analyzed to study the various components of hadron
interactions. This is one of the observable variables most poorly reproduced by
the available Monte Carlo generators. A first measurement of the event
transverse energy sum differential cross section is also reported. A comparison
with a Pythia prediction at the hadron level is performed. The inclusive
charged particle differential production cross section is fairly well
reproduced only in the transverse momentum range available from previous
measurements. At higher momentum the agreement is poor. The transverse energy
sum is poorly reproduced over the whole spectrum. The dependence of the charged
particle transverse momentum on the particle multiplicity needs the
introduction of more sophisticated particle production mechanisms, such as
multiple parton interactions, in order to be better explained.

applying Brodsky, Lepage and Mackenzie scale setting for the renormalization
scale, it is found that the QCD perturbative expansion is significantly
improved with the unique scale choice $\mu^*=1.65$GeV. Together with the
$\psi^\prime$ feed-down contribution, the total cross section and momentum
distribution can account for the recent experimental measurement by the Belle

to be consistent with the experimental measurement in the previous study on
$e^+e^-\to J/\psi gg$. However, the production angular distribution of $J/\psi$
production for either the $J/\psi c\bar{c}$ or the $J/\psi gg$ channel has a
quite different shape in contrast with the new experimental data, although it
fits with the experimental data when the two channels are added together. This
situation is difficult to explain. To clarify the puzzle of $J/\psi$
polarization, further experimental measurements are strongly expected to
testify our predictions on the momentum distribution for $J/\psi$ polarization.
Our total cross section agrees with that given in the previous study of Zhang

pass the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test and exhibit scaling behaviors, among

confirmed by the relation between the fitted exponent $\gamma$ and the
threshold $q$. In addition, the similarity of the return interval distributions

investigation of the conditional probability distribution and the detrended

the core 8.64GHz emission has varied by about 20 per cent over 38 months, and
improves the mapping of the weak jet. With Chandra we measure a
well-constrained power-law spectral index for the X-ray core, uncontaminated by
extended emission from the cluster environment, with a negligible level of
intrinsic absorption. Weak X-ray emission from the resolved radio jet is also
measured. Our analysis suggests that the optical continuum in this radio galaxy

we do \textit{not} assume $f$ is $\mathcal{C}^1$-generic. We have two main
themes in the paper: (1) the chain recurrence; (2) relations among recurrence
points, homoclinic points, shadowability and hyperbolicity. For (1) (without
assuming $M$ is compact), we have the theorem: if $f$ is Lagrange stable, then
$M$ is a chain recurrent set. If $M$ is compact, then the Lagrange-stability is
automatic. For (2) (assuming the compactness of $M$), we prove some various
implications among notions, such as: (i) the $\mathcal{C}^1$-stable
shadowability equals to the hyperbolicity of $M$; (ii) if a point $p\in M$ has
a recurrence point in the unstable manifold $W^u (p, f)$ and there is no
homoclinic point of $p,$ then $f$ is nonshadowable; (iii) if $f$ has the
shadowing property and $p$ has a recurrence point in $W^u (p, f),$ then the
recurrent point is in the limit set of homoclinic points of $p$.

constrains the ejected mass M$_{ign}$ to within 10$^{-5}$ - 10$^{-4}$

depend on a threshold parameter $\gamma$ whose optimal value is hard to

existence of a minimal threshold parameter from the theoretical point of view:
taking $\gamma<1$ deteriorates oracle performances of our procedure. In the
same spirit, we establish the existence of a maximal threshold parameter and
our theoretical results point out the optimal range $\gamma\in[1,12]$. Then, we
lead a numerical study that shows that choosing $\gamma$ larger than 1 but
close to 1 is a fairly good choice. Finally, we compare our procedure with
classical ones revealing the harmful role of the support of functions when

utilized to numerically bound the capacities. In this paper, we take the
delayed channel state as part of the channel input and then define the {\em

the delayed channel state) sequence to the channel output sequence. With this
technique, we derive a series of upper bounds on the capacities of
noncontrollable FSCs with/without feedback. These upper bounds can be achieved
by conditional Markov sources and computed by solving an average reward per

compact action space. By showing that the ARSCP has a uniformly continuous
reward function, we transform the original ARSCP into a finite-state and
finite-action ARSCP that can be solved by a value iteration method. Under a
mild assumption, the value iteration algorithm is convergent and delivers a
near-optimal stationary policy and a numerical upper bound.

of the ferromagnetic-to-paramagnetic (f/N) transition in the spacer and,
thereby, of the relative orientation of the outer F-layers in the device

show theoretically that local Joule heating due to a high concentration of

drive the weakly ferromagnetic spacer through its Curie point and thereby
exchange couple and decouple the two strongly ferromagnetic F-layers. For the
devices designed to have an antiparallel ground state above the Curie point of
the spacer, the associated spin-thermionic parallel-to-antiparallel switching
causes magneto-resistance oscillations whose frequency can be controlled by
proper biasing from essentially DC to GHz. We discuss in detail an experimental

in applications of the standard discrete-time Monte Carlo method to evaluate
options written on the continuous-time extrema of an underlying asset. It is
based on the simple and easy to implement analytic formulas for the
distribution of one-dimensional Brownian Bridge extremes. This paper extends
the technique to the valuation of multi-asset options with knock-out barriers
imposed for all or some of the underlying assets. We derive formula for the
unbiased option price estimator based on the joint distribution of the
multi-dimensional Brownian Bridge dependent extrema. As analytic formulas are
not available for the joint distribution in general, we develop upper and lower
biased option price estimators based on the distribution of independent extrema
and the Fr\'echet lower and upper bounds for the unknown distribution. All
estimators are simple and easy to implement. They can always be used to bind
the true value by a confidence interval. Numerical tests indicate that our
biased estimators converge rapidly to the true option value as the number of
time steps for the asset path simulation increases in comparison to the
estimator based on the standard discrete-time method. The convergence rate
depends on the correlation and barrier structures of the underlying assets.

protostellar cores (perhaps harbouring low-mass sources) can be identified via
their outflows alone. We have used the heterodyne array receiver HARP on JCMT
to make deep 12CO 3-2 maps of submm cores in Perseus, extending and deepening
our earlier study with RxB and bringing the total number of SCUBA cores studied
up to 83. Our survey includes 23/25 of the Dunham et al. (2008) Spitzer
low-luminosity objects believed to be embedded protostars, including three
VeLLOs. All but one of the cores identified as harbouring embedded YSOs have
outflows, confirming outflow detections as a good method for identifying
protostars. We detect outflows from 20 Spitzer low-luminosity objects. We do
not conclusively detect any outflows from IR-quiet cores, though confusion in
clustered regions such as NGC1333 makes it impossible to identify all the
individual driving sources. This similarity in detection rates despite the
difference in search methods and detection limits suggests either that the
sample of protostars in Perseus is now complete, or that the existence of an
outflow contributes to the Spitzer detectability, perhaps through the
contribution of shocked H2 emission in the IRAC bands. For five of the
low-luminosity sources, there is no protostellar envelope detected at 350
microns and the Spitzer emission is entirely due to shocks. Additionally, we

in the galactic halo of Dark Matter particles with multi-TeV mass and a large
annihilation cross section, as indicated by the recent PAMELA results. The
model of Minimal Dark Matter (MDM) is an example in this category. We find that
the fluxes are well within the reach of planned experiments for DM candidates
that annihilate mainly into quark pairs, and also extend into the multi-GeV
range above the background. They are instead suppressed and concentrated at too
large energies to emerge above the background if the main annihilation channel
is into gauge bosons (such as in particular W+W- in the MDM case).

homogeneous fragmentations. Considering the logarithm of masses makes the
situation reminiscent of branching random walks. The standard approach is to
study {\bf asymptotical} exponential rates. For fixed $v > 0$, either the
number of fragments whose sizes at time $t$ are of order $\e^{-vt}$ is
exponentially growing with rate $C(v) > 0$, i.e. the rate is effective, or the
probability of presence of such fragments is exponentially decreasing with rate
$C(v) < 0$, for some concave function $C$. In a recent paper, N. Krell
considered fragments whose sizes decrease at {\bf exact} exponential rates,
i.e. whose sizes are confined to be of order $\e^{-vs}$ for every $s \leq t$.
In that setting, she characterized the effective rates. In the present paper we
continue this analysis and focus on probabilities of presence, using the spine
method and a suitable martingale.

quantitative test inspired by the Johnson, Kendall, and Roberts adhesion test
for soft adhesives, which relies on the formation and then the rupture of a
capillary bridge between the surface to be tested and a liquid bath. Both the
shape and the kinetics of breakage of the capillary bridge for various coatings
put into contact with liquids of various viscosities and surface tensions have
been studied. Several pull off regimes can be distinguished. For low pull off
velocities, a quasi-static regime is observed, well described by capillary
equations and sensitive to the hysteresis of the contact angle of the fluid on
the coating. Above a critical pull off velocity that depends on the fluid
viscosity, a dynamic regime is observed, characterized by the formation of a
flat pancake of fluid on the coating that recedes more slowly than the
capillary bridge itself. After the breakage of the capillary bridge, a small
drop can remain attached to the surface. The volume of this drop depends on the
dynamical regime and is strongly affected by very small differences between the
coatings. The aptitude of this test in characterizing very weakly adhesive
surfaces is exemplified by a comparison between three different perfluorinated
coatings.

on-going removal and destruction by tides. Tides raised on a planet's host star
cause the planet's orbit to decay, even after the orbital eccentricity has
dropped to zero. Comparison of the observed orbital distribution and
predictions of tidal theory show good qualitative agreement, suggesting tidal
destruction of close-in exoplanets is common. The process can explain the
observed cut-off in small a-values, the clustering of orbital periods near
three days, and the relative youth of transiting planets. Contrary to previous
considerations, a mechanism to stop the inward migration of close-in planets at
their current orbits is not necessarily required. Planets nearing tidal
destruction may be found with extremely small a, possibly already stripped of
any gaseous envelope. The recently discovered CoRoT-Exo-7 b may be an example
of such a planet and will probably be destroyed by tides within the next few
Gyrs. Also, where one or more planets have already been accreted, a star may
exhibit an unusual composition and/or spin rate.

hypernuclei in the 1p shell are given in the weak-coupling limit, to update
previous shell-model calculations and to compare with recent pi- spectra and
total decay rates measured by the FINUDA Collaboration. A useful sum rule for
the summed strength of Lambda_{1s} --> pi- + proton_{1p} weak decays is

the primary s-wave amplitude and Cohen-Kurath nuclear wavefunctions. The role
of the p-wave amplitude is studied in detail for Lambda-15N and found to be
