introduced by Rapoport and Zink to study the \'etale-local structure of
integral models of certain PEL Shimura varieties over p-adic fields. A basic
requirement for the integral models, or equivalently for the local models, is
that they be flat. In the case of local models for even orthogonal groups,
Genestier observed that the original definition of the local model does not
yield a flat scheme. In a recent article, Pappas and Rapoport introduced a new
condition to the moduli problem defining the local model, the so-called spin
condition, and conjectured that the resulting ""spin"" local model is flat. We
prove a weak form of their conjecture in the split, Iwahori case, namely that
the spin local model is topologically flat. An essential combinatorial
ingredient is the equivalence of mu-admissibility and mu-permissibility for two
minuscule cocharacters mu in root systems of type D.

  distribution of coordination states of the aqueous ions","4 pages, 3 figures",,,,"physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The S$_2$ site of the KcsA K$^+$ channel has eight carbonyl ligands in the
ion-binding site. A recent study suggests that the K$^+$-over-Na$^+$
selectivity of the S$_2$ site can be understood by noting the larger free
energy change involved in enforcing an eight water coordination state around
Na$^+$ relative to K$^+$. The free energies were obtained from the
probabilities of observing eight water molecules within a coordination sphere
whose radius ($\lambda_{\rm Na^+} \approx 3.1$ {\AA} and $\lambda_{\rm K^+}
\approx 3.5$ {\AA}) extends to the first minimum of the ion-water oxygen pair
correlation function. Curiously, using the same coordination radius led to
results that question the very idea of using coordination states in water to
understand selectivity in the channel. We show that density fluctuations in
neat water at the length scale of the coordination volume enter the description
of the hydration thermodynamics of the ion expressed in terms of its
coordination states. Density fluctuations explain the sensitivity to the choice
of radius. After accounting for this effect, the results lead to the conclusion
that free energy changes involved in the transition between coordination states
in water are inadequate to explain selectivity in the ion-channel.

evidence that the ejecta dust formed in comoving clumps of fixed size. We argue
that, after about two years past explosion, the appearance of wide, box-shaped
optical line profiles was due to the impact of the ejecta on the progenitor
circumstellar medium and that the subsequent formation of a cool, dense shell
was responsible for a later rise in the MIR flux. This study demonstrates the
rich, multi-faceted ways in which a typical core-collapse supernova and its
progenitor can produce and/or interact with dust grains. The work presented
here adds to the growing number of studies which do not support the contention
that SNe are responsible for the large mass of observed dust in high-redshift
galaxies.

ALMA will consist of two arrays of high-precision antennas. One, of up to 64

from 150 meters up to ~15 km. A second array is comprised of a set of four 12-m

electrothermomechanical feedback effect in a nanobeam, which operates as a

amplified, because it modulates the resistive heating power in the nanobeam via
the piezoresistive effect, which results in a temperature variation that causes
a thermal expansion feedback-force from the nanobeam on the resonator mass.
This self-amplification effect can occur in almost any conducting material, but
is particularly effective when the current density and mechanical stress are
concentrated in beams of nano-scale dimensions.

supply and eventually shuts off activity of the central engine. As a result,
the luminosity and mass accretion rate deviate from the earlier self-similar

enables a secondary episode of delayed activity to become prominent as an
observable signature, when material in the tidal tails produced by the initial

magnetic fields at some supernova remnant shocks, which suggests in-situ
generation of magnetic turbulence. The dissertation presents a numerical model
of collisionless shocks with strong amplification of stochastic magnetic
fields, self-consistently coupled to efficient shock acceleration of charged
particles. Based on a Monte Carlo simulation of particle transport and
acceleration in nonlinear shocks, the model describes magnetic field
amplification using the state-of-the-art analytic models of instabilities in
magnetized plasmas in the presence of non-thermal particle streaming. The
results help one understand the complex nonlinear connections between the
thermal plasma, the accelerated particles and the stochastic magnetic fields in
strong collisionless shocks. Also, predictions regarding the efficiency of
particle acceleration and magnetic field amplification, the impact of magnetic
field amplification on the maximum energy of accelerated particles, and the
compression and heating of the thermal plasma by the shocks are presented.
Particle distribution functions and turbulence spectra derived with this model
can be used to calculate the emission of observable nonthermal radiation.

Our analysis yields optimal values for the sampling rate, thus resulting in
tremendous speedups ranging from \emph{2800}x to \emph{70000}x when applied to

excellent.

data while still obtaining the right relic density, we rely on a non standard
thermal history between dark matter freeze-out and Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis
(BBN). We show that through a reheating phase from the decay of a heavy moduli
or even the gravitino, we can produce the right relic density of dark matter if
its self-annihilation cross-section is large enough. In addition to fitting the
recent data, this scenario solves the cosmological moduli and gravitino
problems. We illustrate this mechanism with a specific example in the context
of U(1)_{B-L} extended MSSM where supersymmetry is broken via mirage mediation.
These string motivated models naturally contain heavy moduli decaying to the
gravitino, whose subsequent decay to the LSP can reheat the universe at a low
temperature. The right-handed sneutrino and the B-L gaugino can both be viable
dark matter candidates with large cross-section. They are leptophilic because
of B-L charges. We also show that it is possible to distinguish the non-thermal

experiments for certain regions of parameter space.

surface. The temperature dependence of superfluid density in both systems is
most consistent with the existence of two different gaps. In Ba1-xKxFe2As2, we
find that the superfluid density is sensitive to degrees of disorder inherent
in the crystals, implying unconventional impurity effect. We also determine the
lower critical field $H_{c1}$ in PrFeAsO1-y by using an array of micro-Hall
probes. The temperature dependence of $H_{c1}$ saturates at low temperatures,
fully consistent with the superfluid density determined by microwave
measurements. The anisotropy of $H_{c1}$ has a weak temperature dependence with
smaller values than the anisotropy of upper critical fields at low
temperatures, which further supports the multi-gap superconductivity in
Fe-arsenide systems. The quasiparticle conductivity shows an enhancement in the
superconducting state, which suggests the reduction of quasiparticle scattering
rate due to the gap formation below $T_c$. From these results, we discuss the
structure of the superconducting gap in these Fe-arsenides, in comparison with
the high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors.

phenomenon arising from combined effects of spin-orbit coupling and broken
symmetry of a ferromagnetically ordered state of the system. In this work we
focus on one realization of the AMR in which spin-orbit coupling enters via
specific spin-textures on the carrier Fermi surfaces and ferromagnetism via
elastic scattering of carriers from polarized magnetic impurities. We report
detailed heuristic examination, using model spin-orbit coupled systems, of the
emergence of positive AMR (maximum resistivity for magnetization along
current), negative AMR (minimum resistivity for magnetization along current),
and of the crystalline AMR (resistivity depends on the absolute orientation of
the magnetization and current vectors with respect to the crystal axes)
components. We emphasize potential qualitative differences between pure
magnetic and combined electro-magnetic impurity potentials, between short-range
and long-range impurities, and between spin-1/2 and higher spin-state carriers.
Conclusions based on our heuristic analysis are supported by exact solutions to
the integral form of the Boltzmann transport equation in archetypical
two-dimensional electron systems with Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit
interactions and in the three-dimensional spherical Kohn-Littinger model. We
include comments on the relation of our microscopic calculations to standard
phenomenology of the full angular dependence of the AMR, and on the relevance

to anisotropic transport in the valence band of diluted magnetic

the exposure time on a targeted source is much longer. The point spread

the two longer wavelength bands, being consistent with those expected by the

the PSFs. The flux calibration has been performed by the observations of

chambers which can be reconfigured to meet the requirements for all three
experiments. A pattern recognition and track reconstruction procedure based on
the Kalman filter technique is presented for this detector.
  The pattern recognition proceeds in two stages. At the first stage only hit
straw tube center coordinates, without drift time information, are used to
reduce the background to a manageable level. At the second stage the drift time
information is incorporated and a deterministic annealing filter is applied to
reach the final level of background suppression. The final track momentum
reconstruction is provided by a combinatorial drop filter which is effective in

found to be $\sigma_{p}$ = 0.17 and 0.26 MeV for the $\mu \to e$ conversion and

first detection of the [CII] line in a source with L_FIR < 10^13 L_sun at high
redshift. The line is very strong compared to previous [CII] detections at
high-z (a factor of 5-8 higher in flux), partly due to the lensing
amplification. The L_[CII]/L_FIR ratio is 10^-2.9, which is higher than
observed in local galaxies with similar infrared luminosities. Together with
previous observations of [CII] at high redshift, our result suggests that the
[CII] emission in high redshift galaxies is enhanced relative to local galaxies
of the same infrared luminosity. This finding may result from selection effects
of the few current observations of [CII] at high redshift, and in particular
the fact that non detections may have not been published (although the few
published upper limits are still consistent with the [CII] enhancement
scenario). If the trend is confirmed with larger samples, it would indicate
that high-z galaxies are characterized by different physical conditions with
respect to their local counterparts. Regardless of the physical origin of the
trend, this effect would increase the potential of the [CII]158um line to

stochastic network utility optimization problems. We start by studying the
recently proposed quadratic Lyapunov function based algorithms (QLA). We show
that for every stochastic problem, there is a corresponding
\emph{deterministic} problem, whose dual optimal solution ""exponentially
attracts"" the network backlog process under QLA. In particular, the probability
that the backlog vector under QLA deviates from the attractor is exponentially
decreasing in their Euclidean distance. This not only helps to explain how QLA
achieves the desired performance but also suggests that one can roughly
""subtract out"" a Lagrange multiplier from the system induced by QLA. We thus
develop a family of \emph{Fast Quadratic Lyapunov based Algorithms} (FQLA) that
achieve an $[O(1/V), O(\log^2(V))]$ performance-delay tradeoff for problems
with a discrete set of action options, and achieve a square-root tradeoff for
continuous problems. This is similar to the optimal performance-delay tradeoffs
achieved in prior work by Neely (2007) via drift-steering methods, and shows
that QLA algorithms can also be used to approach such performance.
  These results highlight the ""network gravity"" role of Lagrange Multipliers in
network scheduling. This role can be viewed as the counterpart of the ""shadow
price"" role of Lagrange Multipliers in flow regulation for classic flow-based
network problems.

regarded as the 'golden channel' for the study of the medium produced in
ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions by means of hard probes. This is due to
several reasons, all linked to the fact that because of the smallness of the
electromagnetic coupling alpha, the photon does not substantially interact with
the medium and is expected to escape unmodified. Thus, a high P_T photon
indicates a hard process in the collision independent of the position of the
hard vertex. In contrast, there may not be a clear signal for a hard process
involving strongly interacting partons if the production vertex is deep in the
medium as both partons undergo substantial final state interaction. Equally
important, if photon production by fragmentation can be separated
experimentally, the photon provides almost full knowledge of the initial
kinematics. In the present paper, these properties are used to demonstrate a
distinguishing feature between two assumptions made in modelling the
medium-modifications of strongly interacting high P_T processes: Loss of energy
into the medium vs. medium modification of the partonic shower. Is it shown
that gamma-hadron correlations provide a very clean signature to distinguish
the two scenarios.

attracted attention in the study of single- and bilayer graphene. For
negligible scalar potentials, index theorems explain why the degeneracy of the
zero-energy Landau level of a Dirac hamiltonian is not lifted by gauge field
disorder, for example due to ripples, whereas other Landau levels become
broadened by the inhomogenous effective magnetic field. That also the bilayer
hamiltonian supports such protected bulk zero-modes was proved formally by
Katsnelson and Prokhorova to hold on a compact manifold by using the
Atiyah-Singer index theorem. Here we complement and generalize this result in a
pedestrian way by pointing out that the simple argument by Aharonov and Casher
for degenerate zero-modes of a Dirac hamiltonian in the infinite plane extends
naturally to the multilayer case. The degeneracy remains, though at nonzero
energy, also in the presence of a gap. These threshold modes make the spectrum
asymmetric. The rest of the spectrum, however, remains symmetric even in
arbitrary gauge fields, a fact related to supersymmetry. Possible benefits of
this connection are discussed.

Traditional diagnosis of epilepsy relies on tedious visual screening by highly

very costly and inconvenient to obtain long-term EEG data with seizure

this paper that we can use the interictal scalp EEG data, which is much easier
to collect than the ictal data, to automatically diagnose whether a person is
epileptic. In our automated EEG recognition system, we extract three classes of
features from the EEG data and build Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNNs) fed

these PNNs through a voting mechanism. As a result, our system achieves an
impressive 94.07% accuracy, which is very close to reported human recognition

particle moving on eccentric inclined orbits around a Kerr black hole. For such
systems, the black hole perturbation method is applicable. The gravitational
waves can be evaluated by solving the Teukolsky equation with a point like
source term, which is computed from the stress-energy tensor of a test particle
moving on generic bound geodesic orbits. In our previous papers, we computed
the homogeneous solutions of the Teukolsky equation using a formalism developed
by Mano, Suzuki and Takasugi and showed that we could compute gravitational
waves efficiently and very accurately in the case of circular orbits on the
equatorial plane. Here, we apply this method to eccentric inclined orbits. The
geodesics around a Kerr black hole have three constants of motion: energy,
angular momentum and the Carter constant. We compute the rates of change of the
Carter constant as well as those of energy and angular momentum. This is the
first time that the rate of change of the Carter constant has been evaluated
accurately. We also treat the case of highly eccentric orbits with $e=0.9$. To
confirm the accuracy of our codes, several tests are performed. We find that
the accuracy is only limited by the truncation of $\ell$-, $k$- and $n$-modes,
where $\ell$ is the index of the spin-weighted spheroidal harmonics, and $n$
and $k$ are the harmonics of the radial and polar motion, respectively. When we
set the maximum of $\ell$ to 20, we obtain a relative accuracy of $10^{-5}$
even in the highly eccentric case of $e=0.9$. The accuracy is better for lower
eccentricity. Our numerical code is expected to be useful for computing
templates of the extreme mass ratio inspirals, which is one of the main targets
of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).

work in a basis that contains only off-diagonal entries in the Hamiltonian. We
derive the ""non-adiabaticity"" parameters that appear in the Hamiltonian in this

fluctuation is located at |Q| ~ 0.9 A-1 at low energies and shifts to a higher
value of |Q| ~ 1.2 A-1 at higher energies. The latter value is close to a
reciprocal lattice vector Q = (0.5,0.5,0.5) or (0.5,0.5,0), where the AF
fluctuations are observed in other FeAs-based materials. The existence of this
common characteristic in different Fe-based superconductors suggests that the
AF fluctuations may play a important role in superconductivity.

multi-band (UBVRI) optical coverage of the field with the Wide Field Imager

counterparts to the X-ray sources, down to a V-band limiting magnitude of

refined X-ray positions and to the WFI observations, we found candidate optical
counterparts for most of the X-ray sources in our compilation. For most of the

spectra and the optical colours. Our results indicate that at intermediate
galactic latitude the X-ray source population is dominated by the

which new particle contents (a real singlet scalar field, a pair of charged

have odd quantum number, whereas ordinary gauge fields, quarks and leptons, and

baryogenesis. We discuss phenomenological properties of the model, and find
that there are successful scenarios in which above three problems are solved
simultaneously under the constraint from current experimental data. We then
discuss predictions in such scenarios at ongoing and future experiments. It
turns out that the model provides discriminative predictions especially in

of our results we use some new relations between ordinary moments and canonical
moments of matrix measures which are of their own interest. In particular, it
is shown that the first $k$ canonical moments corresponding to the uniform
distribution on the real or complex moment space $\mathcal{M}_n$ are
independent multivariate Beta distributed random variables and that each of
these random variables converge in distribution (if the parameters converge to
infinity) to the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble or to the Gaussian unitary

crystallized regarding the electronic structure and magnetic properties of

correlated metallic systems that become magnetic by virtue of spin-Peierls type
transition due to near-nesting between the hole and the electron Fermi surface
pockets. The other argues these materials are strongly or at least moderately
correlated, the electrons are considerably localized and close to a
Mott-Hubbard transition, with the local magnetic moments interacting via
short-range superexchange. In this paper we argue that neither picture is fully
correct. The systems are moderately correlated, but with correlations driven by
Hund's rule coupling rather than by the on-site Hubbard repulsion. The iron
moments are largely local, driven by Hund's intra-atomic exchange.
Superexchange is not operative and the interactions between the Fe moments are
considerably long-range and driven mostly by one-electron energies of all
occupied states.

  journal shortly,",,,,"math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Within no inertial frame can stationary charge exist. All charge, wherever it
exists, experiences perpetual interaction with charge elsewhere and so can only
exist as non-trivial current. It follows that the notion of the electrostatic
scalar potential is a pragmatic idealization - it is not fundamental and is
useful simply because, in many practical circumstances, the time scales of
interest are sufficiently small that charges can be considered stationary in
appropriately chosen inertial frames. In this paper, we take the view that the
subsuming of the electrostatic scalar potential within classical
electrodynamics raises issues of fundamental principle and consider the
question of whether it is possible to have a relativistic electrodynamics sans
the electrostatic scalar potential - that is, expressed purely in terms of some
form of relativistic magnetic potential. Surprisingly, we find that such a
thing can be realized in a remarkably simple way - and which is cost-free for
ordinary applications of electrodynamics. But the overall formalism has
fundamental ramifications for our deeper understanding of electrodynamics - for
example, a new relativistic symmetry arises which, naturally interpreted,
implies that the Lorentz force must be considered as a local-action contact
force in which energy-momentum is locally conserved through the medium of an
uncharged massive vector particle.

plasticity theory. The generalization of a proposition relating convexity of

Previous numerical simulations based on various approaches suggested that,
except for near edge-on disk orientations, the amount of stripping depends very
little on the inclination angle. Following our previous study of face-on
stripping, we extend the set of parameters with the disk tilt angle and explore
in detail the effects of the ram pressure on the interstellar content (ISM) of
tilted galaxies that orbit in various environments of clusters, with compact or
extended distributions of the intra-cluster medium (ICM). We further study how
results of numerical simulations could be estimated analytically. A grid of
numerical simulations with varying parameters is produced using the tree/SPH
code GADGET with a modified method for calculating the ISM-ICM interaction.
These SPH calculations extend the set of existing results obtained from
different codes using various numerical techniques. The simulations confirm the
general trend of less stripping at orientations close to edge-on. The
dependence on the disk tilt angle is more pronounced for compact ICM
distributions, however it almost vanishes for strong ram pressure pulses.
Although various hydrodynamical effects are present in the ISM-ICM interaction,
the main quantitative stripping results appear to be roughly consistent with a
simple scenario of momentum transfer from the encountered ICM. This behavior
can also be found in previous simulations. To reproduce the numerical results
we propose a fitting formula depending on the disk tilt angle and on the column
density of the encountered ICM. Such a dependence is superior to that on the
peak ram pressure used in previous simple estimates.

very low spatial resolution. In order to disentangle the evolution of galaxy
kinematics from low resolution effects, we have used Fabry-Perot 3D Ha
data-cubes of 153 nearby isolated galaxies from the GHASP survey to simulate
data-cubes of galaxies at z=1.7. We show that the inner velocity gradient is
lowered and is responsible for a peak in the velocity dispersion map.
Toy-models of rotating disks have been built to recover the parameters from low
resolution data. The poor resolution makes the kinematical inclination
uncertain and the center difficult to recover. The major axis is retrieved with
an accuracy higher than 5deg for 70% of the sample. Toy-models also enable to
retrieve statistically the maximum velocity and the mean velocity dispersion of
galaxies with a satisfying accuracy. This validates the use of the Tully-Fisher
relation for high-z galaxies but the loss of resolution induces a lower slope
at high-z. We conclude that the main kinematic parameters are better
constrained for galaxies with an optical radius larger than three times the
seeing. The simulated data have been compared to actual high-z galaxies data in
the redshift range 3>z>0.4. For rotation-dominated galaxies, we find that the
use of the velocity dispersion central peak as a signature of rotating disks
may misclassify slow and solid body rotators (~30% of our sample). We show that
the projected data cannot reproduce the high velocity dispersion observed in
high-z galaxies except when no beam smearing correction is applied. This
unambiguously means that, at the opposite of local evolved galaxies, there
exists at high redshift at least a population of disk galaxies for which a
large fraction of the dynamical support is due to random motions.

phantom dark disk, Newtonian models with a spherical halo have different
signatures from MOND models close to the Galactic plane. The models can thus be
differentiated by measuring dynamically (within Newtonian dynamics) the disk
surface density at the solar radius, the radial mass gradient within the disk,
or the velocity ellipsoid tilt angle above the Galactic plane. Using the most
realistic possible baryonic mass model for the Milky Way, we predict that, if
MOND applies, the local surface density measured by a Newtonist will be
approximately 78 Msun/pc2 within 1.1 kpc of the Galactic plane, the dynamically
measured disk scale-length will be enhanced by a factor of 1.25 with respect to
the visible disk scale-length, and the local vertical tilt of the velocity
ellipsoid at 1 kpc above the plane will be approximately 6 degrees. None of
these tests can be conclusive for the present-day accuracy of Milky Way data,
but they will be of prime interest with the advent of large surveys such as
GAIA.

scattering in various scattering configurations and at various wavelengths. The
Raman spectra are well-defined and the reported spectral signature together
with the mode assignment sets the basis for the use of Raman scattering for the
investigation of RE-scandates. The observed positions of Raman modes for DyScO3
are for most bands in reasonable agreement with recent theoretical ab initio
predictions of the vibrational spectrum for the same material. Further to the
phonon signature, a luminescence signal is observed for both scandates. While
the luminescence is weak for DyScO3, it is very intense for GdScO3 when using a
488 or 514 nm excitation line, which in turn inhibits full analysis of the
phonon spectrum. We show that a meaningful phonon Raman analysis of GdScO3
samples can be done by using a 633 nm excitation.
