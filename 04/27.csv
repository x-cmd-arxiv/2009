players, who in principle do not trust each other, wish to establish a common
random bit. If we limit ourselves to classical communication, this task
requires either assumptions on the computational power of the players or it
requires them to send messages to each other with sufficient simultaneity to
force their complete independence. Without such assumptions, all classical
protocols are so that one dishonest player has complete control over the
outcome. If we use quantum communication, on the other hand, protocols have
been introduced that limit the maximal bias that dishonest players can produce.
However, those protocols would be very difficult to implement in practice
because they are susceptible to realistic losses on the quantum channel between
the players or in their quantum memory and measurement apparatus. In this
paper, we introduce a novel quantum protocol and we prove that it is completely
impervious to loss. The protocol is fair in the sense that either player has
the same probability of success in cheating attempts at biasing the outcome of
the coin flip. We also give explicit and optimal cheating strategies for both
players.

variety of stars, which are considered as departing from the Asymptotic Giant
Branch (AGB) and have started their post-AGB evolution recently. Most of these
stars are absent optically and are bright in the mid-IR wavelength range.
Spectra of close to 200 objects have been obtained. For all of them the 1-60
micron spectral energy distribution has been constructed using photometric data
from various surveys. We report here on the results of Spitzer observations of
88 IRAS selected post-AGB candidates and discuss them in comparison to the
results of the AKARI observations of post-AGB candidates reported elsewhere in
these proceedings. The dust compositions can be divided broadly in oxygen- and
carbon-rich types, but a variety of intermediate types have been found. Among
the oxygen-rich stars amorphous dust prevails, but a few sources show emission
features from crystalline dust. The spectra from carbon-rich shells may be
completely featureless, may show emission features from PAHs or a molecular
absorption line from C2H2. We found also sources with a neon emission line at
12.8 micron. More than a third of all sources show a near-infrared excess at <
5 micron and almost all of them show evidence of C-rich dust in their shells.
We postulate that the emerging post-AGB wind after the end of AGB evolution
contains always carbon-rich dust irrespective of the chemistry of the former
AGB star.

Here, we suggest a novel method to access a benchmark counting problem, finding

matching algorithm that exploits the equivalence between the chromatic
polynomial and the zero-temperature partition function of the Potts
antiferromagnet on the same graph. Implementing this bottom-up algorithm using
appropriate computer algebra, the new method outperforms standard top-down
methods by several orders of magnitude, already for moderately sized graphs. As
a first application, we compute chromatic polynomials of samples of the simple

lattices of physical relevance. The method offers straightforward
generalizations to several other counting problems.

the Ricci tensor in 5D corresponds exactly to what one would obtain from

As a consequence, geodesic motions do not distinguish the torsion free 4D

assigns penalties to each tile of the database images and updates the tile
penalties for all relevant images retrieved at each iteration using both the
relevant and irrelevant images identified by the user. Each tile is modeled by
means of its color content using a compact but very efficient method which can,
indirectly, capture some notion of texture as well, despite the fact that only
color information is maintained. Performance evaluation on a largely
heterogeneous dataset of over 10,000 images shows that the system can achieve a

compare to population synthesis models. Lower metallicity systems are found to
have redder [3.6] - [4.5] colors on average, but with considerable scatter. The
observed range in [3.6] - [4.5] color is too large to be accounted for solely
by variations in stellar colors due to age or metallicity differences;
interstellar effects must contribute as well. For the reddest systems, the 4.5
micron luminosity may not be a good tracer of stellar mass. We identify three
factors that redden this color in dwarfs. First, in some systems, strong
Br-alpha emission contributes significantly to the 4.5 micron emission. Second,
in some cases high optical depths lead to strong reddening of the starlight in
the Spitzer bands. Third, in some galaxies, the nebular continuum dominates the
4.5 micron flux, and in extreme cases, the 3.6 micron flux as well. The harder
UV radiation fields in lower metallicity systems produce both more gaseous
continuum in the infrared and more Br-alpha per star formation rate. The
combination of these three factors can account for the 4.5 micron excess in our
sample galaxies, thus it is not necessary to invoke a major contribution from
hot dust to the 4.5 micron band. However, given the uncertainties, we are not
able to completely rule out hot dust emission at 4.5 micron. More spectroscopic
observations in the 3 - 5 micron range are needed to disentangle these effects.

design for Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks (MANETs), since mobile nodes are powered by
limited-capacity batteries. Furthermore, replacing or recharging batteries is
often impossible in critical environments (e.g. battlefields, disaster areas,

bandwidth consumption. However, recent works have shown that ""energy"" and
""bandwidth"" are substantially different metrics. Moreover, it was found that
traditional routing policies such as ""the shortest path"" one can have a
negative impact on energy consumption balance. Therefore, several new
approaches have been proposed addressing energy efficiency explicitly. Our work
is related to energy efficient routing for MANETs' problem. The proposed
MEA-DSR (Multipath Energy-Aware on Demand Source Routing) protocol is based on
a load sharing strategy between mobile nodes in order to maximize network
lifetime. To achieve this goal, we used multipath routing; nodes' residual
energies and paths length were also considered when making routing decisions.
Simulation results have shown the efficiency of the proposed protocol under

to dynamical backaction enabling amplification and cooling of mechanical

oscillators to an ultra-high finesse optical microresonator via its evanescent
field, extending cavity optomechanics to nanomechanical oscillators. Dynamical
backaction mediated by the optical dipole force is observed, leading to
laser-like coherent nanomechanical oscillations solely due to radiation
pressure. Moreover, sub-fm/Hz^(1/2) displacement sensitivity is achieved, with
a measurement imprecision equal to the standard quantum limit (SQL), which
coincides with the nanomechanical oscillator's zero-point fluctuations. The
achievement of an imprecision at the SQL and radiation-pressure dynamical
backaction for nanomechanical oscillators may have implications not only for
detecting quantum phenomena in mechanical systems, but also for a variety of
other precision experiments. Owing to the flexibility of the near-field
coupling approach, it can be readily extended to a diverse set of
nanomechanical oscillators and particularly provides a route to experiments
where radiation pressure quantum backaction dominates at room temperature,
enabling ponderomotive squeezing or QND measurements.

technological networks to external perturbations has numerous applications.
Random Boolean Networks (RBNs) are commonly used a simple generic model for
certain dynamics of complex systems. Traditionally, RBNs are interconnected
randomly and without considering any spatial extension and arrangement of the
links and nodes. However, most real-world networks are spatially extended and
arranged with regular, power-law, small-world, or other non-random connections.
Here we explore the RBN network topology between extreme local connections,
random small-world, and pure random networks, and study the damage spreading
with small perturbations. We find that spatially local connections change the
scaling of the relevant component at very low connectivities ($\bar{K} \ll 1$)
and that the critical connectivity of stability $K_s$ changes compared to
random networks. At higher $\bar{K}$, this scaling remains unchanged. We also
show that the relevant component of spatially local networks scales with a
power-law as the system size N increases, but with a different exponent for
local and small-world networks. The scaling behaviors are obtained by
finite-size scaling. We further investigate the wiring cost of the networks.
  From an engineering perspective, our new findings provide the key design
trade-offs between damage spreading (robustness), the network's wiring cost,
and the network's communication characteristics.

less than the critical value are confined largely by pressure, while those with
masses greater than or equal to the critical value collapse under self
gravitation. Both types of fragments are commonly observed. Without specifying
the source of the external pressure, and without assuming any other scaling
relations, we predict the power - law index in the relation between the rms
velocity of supersonic motions and the size of fragments . We then investigate
the possibility that the external pressure is due to the kinetic energy of H
atoms released by photodissociation of hydrogen molecules in the fragment. This
can account approximately for the observed values of external pressure and two
additional observations: the value of the scaling coefficient in the power law
mentioned above, and the observation of outflowing atomic hydrogen around
molecular clouds. A further prediction is HI at fragment edges with column
densities of order 1E20 per sq. cm and velocities of a few km/s that should be
detectable with high resolution 21 cm observations. Finally, we predict the

Most of the masers appear to trace a sequence of bow-shocks in a bipolar

strongest emission is found toward the molecular core MM1. The radio sources in
MM1 are located about 5"" north of the symmetry center of the CH3OH outflow, and
therefore, they are unlikely to be associated with the outflow. Instead, the
driving source of the outflow is likely located in the MM2 core. Although based
on circumstantial evidence, the radio continuum from MM1 appears to trace
free-free emission from shock-ionized gas in a jet. The orientation of the

inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) surrounding a Kerr black hole with arbitrary
spins, inclination angles, and observational wavelengths. For the same initial
conditions, such as the fixed accretion rate, it is found that the intrinsic
size and radiation intensity of the images become larger, but the images become
more compact in the inner region, while the size of the black hole shadow
decreases with the increase of the black hole spin. With the increase of the
inclination angles, the shapes of the black hole shadows change and become
smaller, even disappear at all due to the obscuration by the thick disks. For
median inclination angles, the radial velocity observed at infinity is larger
because of both the rotation and radial motion of the fluid in the disk, which
results in the luminous part of the images is much brighter. For larger
inclination angles, such as the disk is edge on, the emission becomes dimmer at
longer observational wavelengths (such as at 7.0mm and 3.5mm wavelengths), or
brighter at shorter observational wavelengths (such as at 1.3 mm wavelength)
than that of the face on case, except for the high spin and high inclination
images. These complex behaviors are due to the combination of the Lorentz
boosting effect and the radiative absorption in the disk. We hope our results
are helpful to determine the spin parameter of the black hole in low luminosity
sources, such as the Galactic center. A primary analysis by comparison with the
observed sizes of Sgr A* at millimeters strongly suggests that the disk around
the central black hole at Sgr A* is highly inclined or the central black hole
is rotating fast.

interpolation. A novel energy reconstruction procedure, based on the
utilization of Artificial Neural Network (ANN), has been developed for the
TACTIC atmospheric Cherenkov imaging telescope. The procedure uses a 3:30:1 ANN
configuration with resilient backpropagation algorithm to estimate the energy
of a $\gamma$-ray like event on the basis of its image SIZE, DISTANCE and
zenith angle. The new ANN-based energy reconstruction method, apart from
yielding an energy resolution of $\sim$ 26%, which is comparable to that of
other single imaging telescopes, has the added advantage that it considers
zenith angle dependence as well. Details of the ANN-based energy estimation
procedure along with its comparative performance with other conventional energy
reconstruction methods are presented in the paper and the results indicate that
amongst all the methods considered in this work, ANN method yields the best
results. The performance of the ANN-based energy reconstruction has also been
validated by determining the energy spectrum of the Crab Nebula in the energy
range 1-16 TeV, as measured by the TACTIC telescope.

the mass-to-light ratio (M*/L) of the stellar disc is a function of radius.
This is indeed predicted by chemo-photometric models of galactic discs.
  We investigate the distribution of luminous and dark matter in spiral
galaxies, taking into account the radial dependence of the stellar M*/L - which
is usually assumed to be constant in studies of the mass structure.
  From the chemo-photometric models of Portinari et al. (2004) and in agreement
with the observed radial profiles of galaxy colours, we derive the typical
average M*/L profile of the stellar discs of spiral galaxies. We compute the
corresponding Variable Mass-to-Light (VML) stellar surface density profile and
then the VML disc contribution to the circular velocity. We use the latter,
combined with a well studied dark matter velocity profile, to mass model the
co-added rotation curves of Persic et al. (1996). (See
http://www.facebook.com/home.php#!/group.php?gid=310260450630 to retrieve extra
information on the kinematics of galaxies) By investigating rotation curves in
the framework of VML stellar discs, we confirm, to a first approximation, the
scenario obtained with the constant M*/L assumption: a dark matter halo with a
shallow core, an inner baryon-dominated region and a larger proportion of Dark
Matter in smaller objects. However, the resulting size of the the dark halo
core and of the inner baryon dominance region are somewhat smaller. The
stronger role that VML discs have in the innermost regions is important to
constrain the galaxy mass structure in both Lambda Cold Dark Matter and MOND
scenarios.

particularly suitable for high-frequency trading systems and can be applied

the ultrarelativistic plasma particles in the open field line tube of a pulsar

energies as a result of resonant absorption of pulsar radio emission. The
spontaneous synchrotron re-emission of these particles falls into the optical
and soft X-ray ranges and can at least partially account for the pulsar
non-thermal high-energy emission. Besides that, the radio photons, which are
still below the resonance, can be deposited into the high-energy range by means
of the scattering off the gyrating particles. This process can also markedly
contribute to the pulsar high-energy emission and underlie the potentially
observable features of the radio -- high-energy connection. Based on the theory
developed, we interpret the manifestations of the radio -- high-energy
connection already observed in the Crab and Vela pulsars. Furthermore, it is
shown that generally the most prominent connection is expected at the lowest
radio frequencies, beyond the low-frequency turnover of a pulsar.

scattering spectrometers to make unresolved Doppler velocity observations of
the Sun. Unresolved measurements are not homogenous across the solar disc and
so the observed data do not represent a uniform average over the entire
surface. The influence on the inhomogeneity of the solar rotation and limb
darkening has been considered previously (Brookes et al. 1978a) and is well
understood. Here we consider a further effect that originates from the
instrumentation itself. The intensity of light observed from a particular
region on the solar disc is dependent on the distance between that region on
the image of the solar disc formed in the instrument and the detector. The
majority of BiSON instruments have two detectors positioned on opposite sides
of the image of the solar disc and the observations made by each detector are
weighted towards differing regions of the disc. Therefore the visibility and
amplitudes of the solar oscillations and the realization of the solar noise
observed by each detector will differ. We find that the modelled bias is
sensitive to many different parameters such as the width of solar absorption
lines, the strength of the magnetic field in the resonant scattering
spectrometer, the orientation of the Sun's rotation axis, the size of the image
observed by the instrument and the optical depth in the vapour cell. We find
that the modelled results best match the observations when the optical depth at
the centre of the vapour cell is 0.55. The inhomogeneous weighting means that a
`velocity offset' is introduced into unresolved Doppler velocity observations
of the Sun, which varies with time, and so has an impact on the long-term
stability of the observations.

The employed formulation ensures that the two-nucleon T-matrix and

ones formally defined by a reference theory without a cutoff. A feature of our
approach is that it effectively introduces a cutoff into the reference theory
in a way that maintains the long-range part of the exchange current operator;
for applications to effective field theory (EFT), this property is usually
sufficient to guarantee the predictive power of the resulting cutoff theory. In
addition, our approach leads to Ward-Takahashi (WT) identities that are linear
in the interactions.
  From the point of view of EFT's where such a WT identity is satisfied in the

viscous flow inside a rectangular slit of aperture $h_0$ has been investigated
from experimental measurements and numerical simulations. At low enough
Reynolds numbers, $F$ varies linearly with the mean velocity and the viscosity,
allowing for the precise determination of drag coefficients $\lambda_{||}$ and
$\lambda_{\bot}$ corresponding respectively to a mean flow parallel and
perpendicular to the cylinder length $L$. In the parallel configuration, the
variation of $\lambda_{||}$ with the normalized diameter $\beta = d/h_0$ of the
cylinder is close to that for a 2D flow invariant in the direction of the
cylinder axis and does not diverge when $\beta = 1$. The variation of
$\lambda_{||}$ with the distance from the midplane of the model reflects the
parabolic Poiseuille profile between the plates for $\beta \ll 1$ while it
remains almost constant for $\beta \sim 1$. In the perpendicular configuration,
the value of $\lambda_{\bot}$ is close to that corresponding to a 2D system
only if $\beta \ll 1$ and/or if the clearance between the ends of the cylinder
and the side walls is very small: in that latter case, $\lambda_{\bot}$
diverges as $\beta \to 1$ due to the blockage of the flow. In other cases, the
side flow between the ends of the cylinder and the side walls plays an
important part to reduce $\lambda_{\bot}$: a full 3D description of the flow is
needed to account for these effects.

factorization for high-$p_T$ hadron hadroproduction is broken by soft gluons in
the Glauber region, which are exchanged among a transverse-momentum-dependent
(TMD) parton density and other subprocesses of the collision. We explain that
the contour of a loop momentum can be deformed away from the Glauber region at
low $p_T$, so the above residual infrared divergence is factorized by means of
the standard eikonal approximation. The $k_T$ factorization is then restored in
the sense that a TMD parton density maintains its universality. Because the
resultant Glauber factor is independent of hadron flavors, experimental
constraints on its behavior are possible. The $k_T$ factorization can also be
restored for the transverse single-spin asymmetry in hadron-hadron collision at
low $p_T$ in a similar way, with the residual infrared divergence being
factorized into the same Glauber factor.

governs the performance of IEEE 802.11. A simplistic principle founded upon
regular variation theory is that the backoff time has a truncated Pareto-type
tail distribution with an exponent of $(\log \gamma)/\log m$ ($m$ is the
multiplicative factor and $\gamma$ is the collision probability). This reveals
that the per-node backoff process is heavy-tailed in the strict sense for
$\gamma>1/m^2$, and paves the way for the following unifying result.
  The state-of-the-art theory on the superposition of the heavy-tailed
processes is applied to establish a dichotomy exhibited by the aggregate
backoff process, putting emphasis on the importance of time-scale on which we
view the backoff processes. While the aggregation on normal time-scales leads
to a Poisson process, it is approximated by a new limiting process possessing
long-range dependence (LRD) on coarse time-scales. This dichotomy turns out to
be instrumental in formulating short-term fairness, extending existing formulas
to arbitrary population, and to elucidate the absence of LRD in practical
situations. A refined wavelet analysis is conducted to strengthen this
argument.

forced planets in a turbulent disk presented in a recent paper by Rein and
Papaloizou. We identify two modes of libration in systems with planets in mean
motion resonance which react differently to random forces. The slow mode, which
mostly corresponds to motion of the angle between the apsidal lines of the two
planets, is converted to circulation more readily than the fast mode which is
associated with oscillations of the semi-major axes.
  We therefore conclude that stochastic forcing due to disk turbulence may have
played an important role in shaping the configuration of observed systems in
mean motion resonance. For example, it naturally provides a mechanism for
accounting for the HD128311 system for which the fast mode librates and the
slow mode does not.

works, but transfinite digraphs had not as yet been investigated. The present
work embarks upon such a task. As with the ordinals, transfinite digraphs
appear in a hierarchy of ranks indexed by the countable ordinals. The digraphs
of rank 0 are the conventional digraphs. Those of rank 1 are constructed by
defining certain extremities of 0-ranked digraphs, and then partitioning those
extremities to obtain vertices of rank 1. Then, digraphs of rank 0 are
connected together at those vertices of rank 1 to obtain a digraph of rank 1.
This process can be continued through the natural-number ranks. However, to
achieve a digraph whose rank is the first infinite ordinal $\omega$ (i.e., the
first limit ordinal), a special kind of transfinite digraph, which we call a
digraph with an ""arrow rank"" must first be constructed in a way different from
those of natural-number rank. Then, digraphs of still higher ranks can be
constructed in a way similar to that for the natural-number ranked digraphs.
However, just before each limit-ordinal rank, a digraph of arrow rank must be
set up.

informed by recent simulations of dense core populations. Measurements of
radial velocities using complimentary C18O (1-0) observations enable us to cull
out from this sample those 43 extinction peaks that are either not associated

we use the derived C18O, central velocities to differentiate between single
cores with internal structure and blends of two or more physically distinct
cores, superposed along the same line-of-sight. We then are able to produce a
more robust dense core sample for future follow-up studies and a more reliable
CMF than was possible previously. We confirm earlier indications that the CMF
for the Pipe Nebula departs from a single power-law like form with a break or
knee at M ~ 2.7 +/- 1.3 Msun. Moreover, we also confirm that the CMF exhibits a
similar shape to the stellar IMF, but is scaled to higher masses by a factor of
~4.5. We interpret this difference in scaling to be a measure of the star
formation efficiency (22 +/- 8%). This supports earlier suggestions that the

third dredge up episode, which carries to the surface the freshly synthesized

ingestion phase, a very high neutron density is attained and the s-process is
efficiently activated. We therefore adopt a nuclear network of about 700

CRT conditioned not to be extinct which is pruned with an independent intensity
related to $A$. We also study the evolution of the CRT-valued process after the
explosion time. This extends results from Aldous and Pitman on Galton-Watson
trees. For the particular case of the quadratic branching mechanism, we show
that after explosion the total mass of the CRT behaves like the inverse of a

the Maxwell-Bolzmann distribution $p_i$ by means of a twofold link. The first
link is differential and is offered by the Jaynes Maximum Entropy Principle.
The second link is algebraic and imposes that both the entropy and the
distribution must be expressed in terms of the same function in direct and
inverse form. Indeed, the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution $p_i$ is expressed in
terms of the exponential function, while the Boltzmann-Shannon entropy is
defined as the mean value of $-\ln(p_i)$. In generalized statistical mechanics
the second link is customarily relaxed. Here we consider the question if and
how is it possible to select generalized statistical theories in which the
above mentioned twofold link between entropy and the distribution function
continues to hold, such as in the case of ordinary statistical mechanics.
Within this scenario, there emerge new couples of direct-inverse functions,
i.e. generalized logarithms $\Lambda(x)$ and generalized exponentials
$\Lambda^{-1}(x)$, defining coherent and self-consistent generalized
statistical theories. Interestingly, all these theories preserve the main
features of ordinary statistical mechanics, and predict distribution functions
presenting power-law tails. Furthermore, the obtained generalized entropies are

Dirichlet boundary conditions in the context of five-dimensional
Randall-Sundrum models is studied. In these scenarios we derive and calculate
the expression for the Casimir force on the piston. We also discuss the Casimir
force in the limit that one outer plate is moved to the remote place to show
that the nature of the reduced force between the parallel plates left. In the
Randall-Sundrum model involving two branes the two plates attract each other
when they locate very close, but the reduced Casimir force turns to be
repulsive as the plates separation is not extremely tiny, which is against the
experimental phenomena. In the case of one brane model the shape of the reduced
Casimir force is similar to that of the standard two-parallel-system in the
four-dimensional flat spacetimes while the sign of force remains negative.

temperature scales are essentially the same allowing strong correlations
between the amplitude and phase of the order parameter. As non-pair breaking
disorder is introduced the largely overlapping Cooper pairs conspire to
maintain phase coherence such that the critical temperature remains essentially
unchanged. However, in the BEC regime the pair breaking and phase coherence
temperature scales are very different such that non-pair breaking disorder can
affect dramatically phase coherence, and thus the critical temperature, without
the requirement of breaking tightly-bound fermion pairs simultaneously.
