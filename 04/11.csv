electromagnetic interactions, if only via quantum fluctuations. Taken en masse,

the expansion of the index of refraction with frequency, the physical
interpretation of the terms, and the particular observations needed to isolate
its coefficients. This, with the advent of new opportunities to view gamma-ray
bursts at cosmological distance scales, gives us a new probe of dark matter and
a new possibility for its direct detection. As a first application we use the
time delay determined from radio afterglow observations of distant gamma-ray
bursts to realize a direct limit on the electric-charge-to-mass ratio of dark

the same Bonn-C nucleon-nucleon interaction that is used to generate the

first summing high-energy ladder diagrams that account for short-range
correlations and then adding diagrams of low order in the G matrix to account
for longer-range correlations, we fold the two-body matrix elements of the
resulting effective operator with transition densities from the recent
shell-model calculation to obtain the overall nuclear matrix element that
governs the decay. Although the high-energy ladder diagrams suppress this
matrix element at very short distances as expected, they enhance it at
distances between one and two fermis, so that their overall effect is small.
The corrections due to longer-range physics are large, but cancel one another
so that the fully corrected matrix element is comparable to that produced by
the bare operator. This cancellation between large and physically distinct
low-order terms indicates the importance of a reliable nonperturbative
calculation.

spectrum is to calculate the probability of obtaining that value or a larger
value by chance (known as the ""p-value""), on the assumption that the time
series contains only noise - typically that the measurements are derived from
random samplings of a Gaussian distribution. We really need to know the
probability that the time series is - or is not - compatible with the null
hypothesis that the measurements are derived from noise. This probability can
be calculated by Bayesian analysis, but this requires one to specify and
evaluate a second hypothesis, that the time series does contain a contribution
other than noise. We approach the problem of identifying this function in two
ways. We first propose three simple conditions that it seems reasonable to
impose on this function, and show that these conditions may be satisfied by a
simple function with one free parameter. We then define two different ways of
combining information derived from two independent power estimates. We find
that this consistency condition may be satisfied, to good approximation, by a
special case of the previously proposed likelihood function. We find that the
resulting significance estimates are considerably more conservative than those
usually associated with the p-values. As two examples, we apply the new
procedure to two recent analyses of solar neutrino data: (a) power spectrum
analysis of Super-Kamiokande data, and (b) the combined analysis of
radiochemical neutrino data and irradiance data.

promising sources for detectors such as LIGO, Virgo and GEO600. If the
components of the binary posess significant angular momentum (spin), as is
likely to be the case if one component is a black hole, spin-induced precession
of a binary's orbital plane causes modulation of the gravitational-wave
amplitude and phase. If the templates used in a matched-filter search do not
accurately model these effects then the sensitivity, and hence the detection
rate, will be reduced. We investigate the ability of several search pipelines
to detect gravitational waves from compact binaries with spin. We use the
post-Newtonian approximation to model the inspiral phase of the signal and
construct two new template banks using the phenomenological waveforms of
Buonanno, Chen and Vallisneri. We compare the performance of these template
banks to that of banks constructed using the stationary phase approximation to
the non-spinning post-Newtonian inspiral waveform currently used by LIGO and
Virgo in the search for compact binary coalescence. We find that, at the same
false alarm rate, a search pipeline using phenomenological templates is no more
effective than a pipeline which uses non-spinning templates. We recommend the
continued use of the non-spinning stationary phase template bank until the
false alarm rate associated with templates which include spin effects can be
substantially reduced.

rate of a ground-state Fermi gas can also be suppressed by occupation of the

by scattering events near the Fermi edge. We analyze two new approaches to
improve the visibility of Pauli blocking in a trapped Fermi gas. Focusing the
incident light to excite preferentially the high-density region of the cloud
can increase the blocking signature by 14%, and is most effective at

state with lower one proceeds through quantum tunneling or through thermally
catalyzed quantum tunneling (at sufficiently small temperatures). The
transition rate is calculated at zero temperature including the preexponential
factor and also at a finite low temperature. The thermal catalysis factor is
closely related to the probability (effective length) of destruction of the
string (the domain wall) in collisions of the Goldstone bosons, corresponding
to transverse waves on the string (wall). We derive a general formula which
allows to find the probability (effective length) of a string (wall) breakup by
a collision of arbitrary number of the bosons. We find that the destruction of
a string only takes place in collisions of even number of the bosons, while the
destruction of the wall can occur in a collision of any number of particles. We
explicitly calculate the energy dependence of such processes in two-particle
collisions for arbitrary relation between the energy and the largest infrared

can be performed in a completely online manner, without the need for batches or

Although these ideas are presented in a single-hop packet erasure broadcast

network coding in the presence of feedback. The impact of feedback on queue
size at the sender and decoding delay at the receivers is studied. Strategies
for adaptive coding based on feedback are presented, with the goal of
minimizing the queue size and delay. The asymptotic behavior of these metrics
is characterized, in the limit of the traffic load approaching capacity.
Different notions of decoding delay are considered, including an
order-sensitive notion which assumes that packets are useful only when
delivered in order. Our work may be viewed as a natural extension of Automatic

since the birth of the brane world scenario. In many works, it has been usually
assumed that a brane is an infinitely thin object; however in more general
situations, one can no longer assume this. It is also widely considered that
more fundamental theories such as string theory would have a minimal length
scale. Many multidimensional field theories coupled to gravitation have exact
solutions of gravitating topological defects, which can represent our brane
world. The inclusion of brane thickness can realize a variety of possible brane
world models. Given our understanding, the known solutions can be classified
into topologically non-trivial solutions and trivial ones. The former class
contains solutions of a single scalar (domain walls), multi-scalar, gauge-Higgs
(vortices), Weyl gravity and so on. As an example of the latter class, we
consider solutions of two interacting scalar fields. Approaches to obtain

for the arbitrary values of the dilaton coupling constant. We find that the
gyromagnetic ratio crucially depends on the dilaton coupling constant,
$\alpha$, and decreases with increasing $\alpha$ in any dimension.

demonstrated and studied, as an appropriate amplitude modulation to a single
pulse can expand its spectrum and thus increase the utilization efficiency of
the bandwidth of a slow light system. In a single-$\Lambda$ type
electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) system, the slowed AMG pulse
experiences severe distortion, mainly owing to the frequency dependent
transmission of medium. Additionally, due to its spectral distribution, the
frequency dependent dispersion of the medium causes simultaneous slow and fast
light of different spectral components and thus a certain dispersive distortion
of the AMG pulse. Further, a post-processing method is proposed to recover the
slowed (distorted) pulse, which indicates that by introducing a linear optical
system with a desired gain spectrum we can recover the pulse in an
""all-optical"" way. Finally, we discuss the limitations during this compensation
procedure in detail. Although it is demonstrated in the cesium vapor using EIT,
this method should be applicable to a wide range of slow light systems.

the slice projection X/x \to X and the coslice projection x\X \to X, obtained

Improved Perturbation Theory (CIPT) and Renormalon Chain Perturbation Theory
(RCPT). It is often argued that the three methods differ in the treatment of
higher orders only and therefore the full difference should be treated as
theoretical error. Recently other arguments either in favor of FOPT, CIPT or
RCPT have been given, but none of those is able to combine all three to a
single value in the strong coupling constant. In this note I will show that
FOPT alone has a much larger uncertainty than previously assumed and therefore
agrees within error with CIPT. Furthermore a more appropriate matching of the
different schemes used in RCPT reduces the difference to the CIPT result by a
factor of 6. Together with recently published results for the 4th order term
K_4 this reduces the theoretical error on alpha_s by a factor of 2.5 compared

tunneling probabilities for systems involving several degrees of freedom. These
Jensen inequalities are used to discuss several aspects of sub-barrier
heavy-ion fusion reactions. The inequality hinges on general convexity
properties of the tunneling coefficient calculated with the classical action in
the classically forbidden region.

distributions of the first hitting time and place for half-spaces of
codimension one for a diffusion in $\R^{n+1}$, composed of one-dimensional
Bessel process and independent n-dimensional Brownian motion. The most
important argument is carried out for the two-dimensional situation. We show
that this amounts to computation of distributions of various integral
functionals with respect to a two-dimensional process with independent Bessel
components. As a result, we provide a formula for the Poisson kernel of a
half-space or of a strip for the operator $(I-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}$,
$0<\alpha<2$. In the case of a half-space, this result was recently found, by
different methods, in [6]. As an application of our method we also compute
various formulas for first hitting places for the isotropic stable L\'evy
process.

fixed positions in the Fano-Hopfield model (the atomic dipole being modeled
with harmonic oscillators). Compared to earlier works, we do not restrict to
cubic lattices, and we do not regularize the theory by hand but we renormalize
it in a systematic way using a Gaussian cut-off in momentum space. Whereas no
omnidirectional spectral gap is known for light in a Bravais atomic lattice, we
find that, for a wide range of parameters, an omnidirectional gap occurs in a
diamond atomic lattice, which may be realized in an experiment with ultra-cold
atoms. The long-wavelength limit of the theory also provides a Lorentz-Lorenz
(or Clausius-Mossotti) relation for an arbitrary lattice.

framework for banking supervision, referred to as Basel II, many banks adopt
the Loss Distribution Approach. There are many modeling issues that should be
resolved to use the approach in practice. In this paper we review the
quantitative methods suggested in literature for implementation of the
approach. In particular, the use of the Bayesian inference method that allows
to take expert judgement and parameter uncertainty into account, modeling
dependence and inclusion of insurance are discussed.

energy-momentum tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$ at finite temperature in SU($N_c$) gauge
theory with the Wilson action and two different discretizations of
$T_{\mu\nu}$. We do so by using lattice perturbation theory and
non-perturbative Monte-Carlo simulations. These correlators, which are
functions of Euclidean time $x_0$ and spatial momentum ${\bf p}$, are the
starting point for a lattice study of the transport properties of the gluon
plasma. We find that the correlator of the energy $\int d^3x T_{00}$ has much
larger discretization errors than the correlator of momentum $\int d^3x
T_{0k}$. Secondly, the shear and diagonal stress correlators ($T_{12}$ and
$T_{kk}$) require $\Nt\geq 8$ for the $Tx_0={1/2}$ point to be in the scaling
region and the cutoff effect to be less than 10%. We then show that their
discretization errors on an anisotropic lattice with $\as/\at=2$ are comparable
to those on the isotropic lattice with the same temporal lattice spacing.
Finally, we also study finite ${\bf p}$ correlators.

strong force would lead to destruction of all hydrogen in the big bang due to
binding of the diproton and the dineutron with a catastrophic impact on life as
we know it, we show that provided the increase in strong force coupling
constant is less than about 50% substantial amounts of hydrogen remain. The
reason is that an increase in strong force strength leads to tighter binding of
the deuteron, permitting nucleosynthesis to occur earlier in the big bang at
higher temperature than in the standard big bang. Photodestruction of the less
tightly bound diproton and dineutron delays their production to after the bulk
of nucleosynthesis is complete. The decay of the diproton can, however, lead to
relatively large abundances of deuterium.
