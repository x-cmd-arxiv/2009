recently proposed by Bergshoeff, Hohm, and Townsend. The general configuration
of this type is derived and shown to exhibit different branches, with different
asymptotic behaviors. In particular, for the special fine tuning
$m^2=\pm1/(2l^2)$, solutions with logarithmic fall-off arise, while in the
range $m^2>-1/(2l^2)$, spacetimes with Schrodinger isometry group are admitted
as solutions. Solutions that are asymptotically AdS$_3$, both for
Brown-Henneaux and for the weakened boundary conditions, are also identified.
The metric function that characterizes the profile of the AdS-wave behaves as a
massive excitation on the spacetime, with an effective mass given by
$m_{eff}^2=m^2-1/(2l^2)$. For the critical value $m^2=-1/(2l^2)$, the value of
the effective mass precisely saturates the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound for the
AdS$_3$ space where the wave is propagating on. The analogies with the AdS-wave
solutions of topologically massive gravity are also discussed. Besides, we
consider the coupling of both massive deformations to Einstein gravity and find
the exact configurations for the complete theory, discussing all the different
branches exhaustively. One of the effects of introducing the Chern-Simons
gravitational term is that of breaking the degeneracy in the effective mass of
the generic modes of pure New Massive Gravity, producing a fine structure due
to parity violation. Another effect is that the zoo of exact logarithmic
specimens becomes considerably enlarged.

fine density layer features, nevertheless the information which can be obtained
are independent and complementary to the more conventional seismic studies. The
aim of this paper is to assess how well the core and mantle averaged densities
can be reconstructed through atmospheric neutrino radiography. We find that
about a 2% sensitivity for the mantle and 5% for the core could be achieved for

some partial differential equation for $\Lambda$, which is sufficient for the

$\Lambda$ satisfies this PDE, then using a coupling technique, we are able to
construct a global commutation coupling of two annulus SLE$(\kappa,\Lambda)$

degenerate case, which becomes a coupling of two whole-plane SLE$_\kappa$

coupling together with the assumption that such annulus SLE$(\kappa,\Lambda)$

the quantum stability of the theory, which allows dynamical cosmological

indicators such as lithium abundance, X-ray activity, chromospheric activity,

SAR by treating the problem as one of spatial reflectivity signal inversion
over an overcomplete dictionary of target velocities. Since SAR sensor returns
can be related to the spatial frequency domain projections of the scattering
field, we exploit insights from compressed sensing theory to show that moving
targets can be effectively imaged with transmitters and receivers randomly
dispersed in a multi-static geometry within a narrow forward cone around the
scene of interest. Existing approaches to dealing with moving targets in SAR
solve a coupled non-linear problem of target scattering and motion estimation
typically through matched filtering. In contrast, by using an overcomplete
dictionary approach we effectively linearize the forward model and solve the
moving target problem as a larger, unified regularized inversion problem
subject to sparsity constraints.

the fifth nearest-neighbor distance, as a measure of local environment, and the
cluster-centric radius, \rCL, as a proxy for global cluster environment. Our
cluster sample exhibits a Butcher-Oemler effect in both luminosity-selected and
stellar-mass-selected samples. We find that \fred depends strongly on \sig5 and

However, when the cluster galaxies are separated into \rCL bins, or into group
and non-group subsamples, the dependence on local galaxy density becomes much
weaker. This suggests that the properties of the dark matter halo in which the
galaxy resides have a dominant effect on its galaxy population and evolutionary
history. We find that our data are consistent with the scenario that cluster
galaxies situated in successively richer groups (i.e., more massive dark matter

leads to more efficient experimental designs and better understanding of the

stellar separation of only about 20 AU. However, planet formation in such close
binary systems is a challenge to current theory. One of the major theoretical
problems occurs in the intermediate stage-planetesimals accretion into
planetary embryos-during which the companion's perturbations can stir up the
relative velocites(dV) of planetesimals and thus slow down or even cease their
growth. However, all previous studies assumed a 2-dimentional (2D) disk and a
coplanar binary orbit. Extending previous studies by including a 3D gas disk
and an inclined binary orbit with small relative inclination of i_B=0.1-5 deg,
we numerically investigate the conditions for planetesimal accretion at 1-2 AU,
an extension of the habitable zone(1-1.3 AU), around alpha Centauri A in this
paper. Inclusion of the binary inclination leads to: (1) differential orbital
phasing is realized in the 3D space, and thus different-sized bodies are
separated from each other; (2) total impact rate becomes lower, and impacts
mainly occur between similar-sized bodies; (3) accretion is more favored, but
the balance between accretion and erosion remains uncertain, and the ""possible
accretion region"" extends up to 2AU when assuming an optimistic Q*(critical
specific energy that leads to catastrophic fragmentation); and (4) impact
velocities (dV) are significantly reduced but still much larger than their
escape velocities, which infers that planetesimals grow by means of type II
runaway mode. As a conclusion, inclusion of a small binary inclination is a
promising mechanism that favors accretion, opening a possibility that planet
formation in close binary systems can go through the difficult stage of
planetesimals accretion into planetary embryos.

manifold theory ensures that slow manifold, holistic, discretisations exists,

a highly heterogeneous flow characterized by intermittent switching from

three-dimensional Rayleigh-Benard convection with a focus on the Lagrangian
properties of the flow. The volume is a Cartesian slab with an aspect ratio of
four bounded by free-slip planes at the top and bottom and with periodic side
walls. The turbulence is inhomogeneous with respect to the vertical direction.
This manifests in different lateral and vertical two-particle dispersion and in
a dependence of the dispersion on the initial tracer position for short and
intermediate times. Similar to homogeneous isotropic turbulence, the dispersion
properties depend in addition on the initial pair separation and yield a
short-range Richardson-like scaling regime of two-particle dispersion for
initial separations close to the Kolmogorov dissipation length. The Richardson
constant is about half the value of homogeneous isotropic turbulence. The
multiparticle statistics is very close to the homogeneous isotropic case.
Clusters of four Lagrangian tracers show a clear trend to form flat, almost
coplanar objects in the long-time limit and deviate from the Gaussian
prediction. Significant efforts have been taken to resolve the statistics of
the acceleration components up to order four correctly. We find that the
vertical acceleration is less intermittent than the lateral one. The joint
statistics of the vertical acceleration with the local convective and
conductive heat flux suggests that rising and falling thermal plumes are not
associated with the largest acceleration magnitudes. It turns out also that the
Nusselt number which is calculated in the Lagrangian frame converges slowly in
time to the standard Eulerian one.

magnetic strands, are now considered a leading candidate to solve the coronal
heating problem. However, the frequent occurrence of nanoflares requires that
flare-hot plasma be present in the corona at all times. Its detection has
proved elusive until now, in part because the intensities are predicted to be
very faint. Here we report on the analysis of an active region observed with
five filters by Hinode/XRT in November 2006. We have used the filter ratio
method to derive maps of temperature and emission measure both in soft and hard
ratios. These maps are approximate in that the plasma is assumed to be
isothermal along each line-of-sight. Nonetheless, the hardest available ratio
reveals the clear presence of plasma around 10 MK. To obtain more detailed
information about the plasma properties, we have performed Monte Carlo
simulations assuming a variety of non-isothermal emission measure distributions
along the lines-of-sight. We find that the observed filter ratios imply
bi-modal distributions consisting of a strong cool (log T ~ 6.3-6.5) component
and a weaker (few percent) and hotter (6.6 < log T < 7.2) component. The data
are consistent with bi-modal distributions along all lines of sight, i.e.,
throughout the active region. We also find that the isothermal temperature
inferred from a filter ratio depends sensitively on the precise temperature of
the cool component. A slight shift of this component can cause the hot
component to be obscured in a hard ratio measurement. Consequently, temperature
maps made in hard and soft ratios tend to be anti-correlated. We conclude that
this observation supports the presence of widespread nanoflaring activity in
the active region.

For large tick stocks, we show that a model where the bare impact of all events
is permanent and non-fluctuating is in good agreement with the data. For small
tick stocks, however, bare impacts must contain a history dependent part,
reflecting the internal fluctuations of the order book. We show that this
effect can be accurately described by an autoregressive model on the past order
flow. This framework allows us to decompose the impact of an event into three
parts: an instantaneous jump component, the modification of the future rates of
the different events, and the modification of the future gaps behind the best
quotes. We compare in detail the present formalism with the temporary impact
model that was proposed earlier to describe the impact of market orders when
other types of events are not observed. Finally, we extend the model to
describe the dynamics of the bid-ask spread.

$A$-algebra if all of its nilpotent subalgebras are abelian. This is analogous
to the concept of an $A$-group: a finite group with the property that all of
its Sylow subgroups are abelian. These groups were first studied in the 1940s
by Philip Hall, and are still studied today. Rather less is known about
$A$-algebras, though they have been studied and used by a number of authors.
The purpose of this paper is to obtain more detailed results on the structure
of solvable Lie $A$-algebras. It is shown that they split over each term in
their derived series. This leads to a decomposition of $L$ as $L = A_{n}
\dot{+} A_{n-1} \dot{+} ... \dot{+} A_0$ where $A_i$ is an abelian subalgebra
of $L$ and $L^{(i)} = A_{n} \dot{+} A_{n-1} \dot{+} ... \dot{+} A_{i}$ for each
$0 \leq i \leq n$. It is shown that the ideals of $L$ relate nicely to this
decomposition: if $K$ is an ideal of $L$ then $K = (K \cap A_n) \dot{+} (K \cap
A_{n-1}) \dot{+} ... \dot{+} (K \cap A_0)$. When $L^2$ is nilpotent we can
locate the position of the maximal nilpotent subalgebras: if $U$ is a maximal
nilpotent subalgebra of $L$ then $U = (U \cap L^2) \oplus (U \cap C)$ where $C$
is a Cartan subalgebra of $L$. If $L$ has a unique minimal ideal $W$ then $N =
Z_L(W)$. If, in addition, $L$ is strongly solvable the maximal nilpotent
subalgebras of $L$ are $L^2$ and the Cartan subalgebras of $L$ (that is, the
subalgebras that are complementary to $L^2$.) Necessary and sufficient
conditions are given for such an algebra to be an $A$-algebra. Finally, more
detailed structure results are given when the underlying field is algebraically
closed.

standard model (SM), crying out for verification at the CERN Large Hadron
Collider (LHC), is extra-dimension. To hunt for effects of Kaluza-Klein (KK)
excitations of known fermions and bosons is very much in the agenda of the LHC.
These KK states arise when the SM particles penetrate in the extra space-like
dimension(s). In this paper, we consider a 5d scenario, called `Universal Extra
Dimension', where the extra space coordinate, compactified on an orbifold
$S^1/Z_2$, is accessed by {\em all} the particles. The KK number ($n$) is
conserved at all tree level vertices. This entails the production of KK states
in pairs and renders the lightest KK particle stable, which leaves the detector
carrying away missing energy. The splitting between different KK flavors is
controlled by the zero mode masses and the bulk- and brane-induced one-loop
radiative corrections. We concentrate on the production of an $n=1$ KK
electroweak gauge boson in association with an $n=1$ KK quark. This leads to a
signal consisting of {\em only one} jet, one or more leptons and missing $p_T$.
For definiteness we usually choose the inverse radius of compactification to be
$R^{-1} = 500$ GeV, which sets the scale of the lowest lying KK states. We show
on a case-by-case basis (depending on the number of leptons in the final state)
that with 10 ${\rm fb}^{-1}$ integrated luminosity at the LHC with $\sqrt{s}$ =
14 TeV this signal can be detected over the SM background by imposing
appropriate kinematic cuts. We record some of the expectations for a possible
intermediate LHC run at $\sqrt{s}$ = 10 TeV and also exhibit the integrated
luminosity required to obtain a 5$\sigma$ signal as a function of $R^{-1}$.

gravity-driven instability, characterized by the competition between frictional
sliding and tension cracking, using array of slider blocks on an inclined basal
surface, which interact via elastic-brittle springs. A realistic state- and
rate-dependent friction law describes the block-surface interaction. The inner
material damage occurs via stress corrosion. Three regimes, controlling the
mass instability and its precursory behavior, are classified as a function of
the ratio $T_c/T_f$ of two characteristic time scales associated with internal
damage/creep and with frictional sliding. For $T_c/T_f \gg 1$, the whole mass
undergoes a series of internal stick and slip events, associated with an
initial slow average downward motion of the whole mass, and progressively
accelerates until a global coherent runaway is observed. For $T_c/T_f \ll 1$,
creep/damage occurs sufficiently fast compared with nucleation of sliding,
causing bonds to break, and the bottom part of the mass undergoes a
fragmentation process with the creation of a heterogeneous population of
sliding blocks. For the intermediate regime $T_c/T_f \sim 1$, a macroscopic
crack nucleates and propagates along the location of the largest curvature
associated with the change of slope from the stable frictional state in the
upper part to the unstable frictional sliding state in the lower part. The
other important parameter is the Young modulus $Y$ which controls the
correlation length of displacements in the system.

Instead, the biochemical reactions must be treated as stochastic processes that

investigate the stochastic reaction kinetics of covalent modification cycles

the temporally fluctuating concentration. Depending on the parameter regime, we
find for the probability density of the concentration qualitatively distinct

modeling and inference tools for counterfactual distributions based on

ceteris paribus changes in either the distribution of covariates related to the
outcome of interest or the conditional distribution of the outcome given
covariates. For either of these scenarios we derive joint functional central
limit theorems and bootstrap validity results for regression-based estimators
of the status quo and counterfactual outcome distributions. These results allow
us to construct simultaneous confidence sets for function-valued effects of the
counterfactual changes, including the effects on the entire distribution and
quantile functions of the outcome as well as on related functionals. These
confidence sets can be used to test functional hypotheses such as no-effect,
positive effect, or stochastic dominance. Our theory applies to general
counterfactual changes and covers the main regression methods including
classical, quantile, duration, and distribution regressions. We illustrate the
results with an empirical application to wage decompositions using data for the
United States.
  As a part of developing the main results, we introduce distribution
regression as a comprehensive and flexible tool for modeling and estimating the
\textit{entire} conditional distribution. We show that distribution regression
encompasses the Cox duration regression and represents a useful alternative to
quantile regression. We establish functional central limit theorems and
bootstrap validity results for the empirical distribution regression process
