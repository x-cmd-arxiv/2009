optimized for study of high-z GRBs as probes of the early Universe. With a High
Energy Telescope (HET) incorporating a 4.5m^2 5-600keV (CZT; 0.6mm pixels)
detector plane for coded aperture imaging a 90deg x 70deg (>10% coding
fraction) field of view with 2' resolution and <20"" (90% conf.) positions for
>5 sigma sources, EXIST will perform rapid (<200sec) slews onto GRBs. Prompt
images and spectra are obtained with a co-aligned soft X-ray telescope (SXI;
0.1 - 10keV) and with a 1.1m optical-IR telescope (IRT) simultaneously in 4
bands (0.3 - 0.52micron, 0.52 - 0.9micron, 0.9 - 1.38micron, and 1.38 -
2.3micron). An initial image (100s) will yield prompt identification within the
HET error circle from a <2"" prompt SXI position; or from VIS vs. IR dropouts or
variability. An autonomous spacecraft re-point (<30"") will then put the GRB on
a 0.3"" x 4"" slit for either R = 3000 (for AB <21) or R =30 (for AB ~21-25)
prompt spectra over the 0.3 - 0.9 micron and 0.9 - 2.3 micron bands. This will
provide onboard redshifts within ~500-2000sec for most GRBs, reaching z ~20
(for Lyman-alpha breaks) if such GRBs exist, and spectra for studies of the
host galaxy and local re-ionization patchiness as well as intervening cosmic
structure. With ~600 GRBs/yr expected, including ~7-10% expected at z >7, EXIST
will open a new era in studies of the early Universe as well as carry out a
rich program of AGN and transient-source science. An overview of the GRB
science objectives and a brief discussion of the overall mission design and
operations is given, and example high-z GRB IRT spectra are shown. EXIST is
being proposed to the Astro2010 Decadal Survey as a 5 year Medium Class mission

the escape of Lyman alpha photons during cosmological hydrogen recombination.
We pay particular attention to the influence of atomic recoil, Doppler boosting
and Doppler broadening using a Fokker-Planck approximation of the
redistribution function describing the scattering of photons on the Lyman alpha
resonance of moving hydrogen atoms. We extend the computations of our recent
paper on the influence of the 3d/3s-1s two-photon channels on the dynamics of
hydrogen recombination, simultaneously including the full time-dependence of
the problem, the thermodynamic corrections factor, leading to a
frequency-dependent asymmetry between the emission and absorption profile, and
the quantum-mechanical corrections related to the two-photon nature of the
3d/3s-1s emission and absorption process on the exact shape of the Lyman alpha
emission profile. We show here that due to the redistribution of photons over
frequency hydrogen recombination is sped up by DN_e/N_e~-0.6% at z~900. For the
CMB temperature and polarization power spectra this results in
|DC_l/C_l|~0.5%-1% at l >~ 1500, and therefore will be important for the
analysis of future CMB data in the context of the PLANCK Surveyor, SPT and ACT.
The main contribution to this correction is coming from the atomic recoil
effect (DN_e/N_e~-1.2% at z~900), while Doppler boosting and Doppler broadening
partially cancel this correction, again slowing hydrogen recombination down by
DN_e/N_e~0.6% at z~900. The influence of electron scattering close to the
maximum of the Thomson visibility function at z~1100 can be neglected.

higher than the previous multipartite entanglement purification protocols. As a
by-product, we can get a bipartite pure Bell state when the purification

explore the problem of whether star formation in low mass dark halos (< 10^{7}

shock: one is the evacuation of gas components from the halos and the other is
the promotion of H_2 formation because of the enhanced ionization degree by
shock heating. Combining above effects, we find that the star formation
activities in the neighboring dark matter halos (M < 10^{7} M_sun) are
basically suppressed in case they are located close to the SN center, because
of the gas evacuation effect. The critical distance within which the gas is
blown away falls within the range $\sim 0.3-1.5$kpc depending on the SN energy
and the halo mass. In addition, we find there is very little window in the

patterns can result in improved dose distributions while providing better
access and reducing trauma.
  Methods: Prostate HDR brachytherapy uses a grid of parallel needle positions
to guide the catheter insertion. This geometry does not easily allow the
physician to avoid piercing the critical structures near the penile bulb nor
does it provide position flexibility in the case of pubic arch interference. On
CT data from ten previously-treated patients new catheters were digitized
following three catheter patterns: conical, bi-conical, and fireworks. The
conical patterns were used to accommodate a robotic delivery using a single
entry point. The bi-conical and fireworks patterns were specifically designed
to avoid the critical structures near the penile bulb. For each catheter
distribution, a plan was optimized with the inverse planning algorithm, IPSA,
and compared with the plan used for treatment. Irrelevant of catheter geometry,
a plan must fulfill the RTOG-0321 dose criteria for target dose coverage.
  Results: Thirty plans from ten patients were optimized. All non-standard
patterns fulfilled the RTOG criteria when the clinical plan did. In some cases,
the dose distribution was improved by better sparing the organs-at-risk.
  Conclusion: Alternative catheter patterns can provide the physician with
additional ways to treat patients previously considered unsuited for
brachytherapy treatment (pubic arch interference) and facilitate robotic
guidance of catheter insertion. In addition, alternative catheter patterns may
decrease toxicity by avoidance of the critical structures near the penile bulb
while still fulfilling the RTOG criteria.

Carinae during the last two visual minimum phases of its S-Dor cycle (1985-1990
and 2000-2003). The analysis reveals an overabundance of He, N, and Na, and a
depletion of H, C, and O, on the surface of AG Car, indicating the presence of
CNO-processed material. Furthermore, the ratio N/O is higher on the stellar
surface than in the nebula. We found that the minimum phases of AG Car are not
equal to each other, since we derived a noticeable difference between the
maximum effective temperature achieved during 1985-1990 (22,800 K) and
2000-2001 (17,000 K). While the wind terminal velocity was 300 km/s in
1985-1990, it was as low as 105 km/s in 2001. The mass-loss rate, however, was
lower from 1985-1990 (1.5 x 10^(-5) Msun/yr) than from 2000-2001 (3.7 x 10^(-5)
Msun/yr). We found that the wind of AG Car is significantly clumped (f=0.10 -
0.25) and that clumps must be formed deep in the wind. We derived a bolometric
luminosity of 1.5 x 10^6 Lsun during both minimum phases which, contrary to the
common assumption, decreases to 1.0 x 10^6 Lsun as the star moves towards
maximum flux in the V band. Assuming that the decrease in the bolometric
luminosity of AG Car is due to the energy used to expand the outer layers of
the star (Lamers 1995), we found that the expanding layers contain roughly 0.6
- 2 Msun. Such an amount of mass is an order of magnitude lower than the
nebular mass around AG Car, but is comparable to the nebular mass found around
lower-luminosity LBVs and to that of the Little Homunculus of Eta Car. If such
a large amount of mass is indeed involved in the S Dor-type variability, we
speculate that such instability could be a failed Giant Eruption, with several
solar masses never becoming unbound from the star.(abridged)

to pair fraction counts, considers mergers that have already taken place, and
allows a more direct comparison with the observed rates and fractions measured

evolution of the predicted merger fraction and rate in the Millennium

that the predicted merger rates and fractions match the observations well for
galaxies with M_* > 10^11 M_sun at z<2, while significant discrepancies occur
at lower stellar masses, and at z>2 for M_* > 10^11 M_sun systems. At z>2 the
simulations underpredict the observed merger fractions by a factor of 4-10. The
shape of the predicted merger fraction and rate evolutions are similar to the
observations up to z~2, and peak at 1<z<2 in almost all mass bins. The
exception is the merger rate of galaxies with M_* > 10^11 M_sun. We discuss
possible reasons for these discrepancies, and compare different realisations of

implementation of feedback. We conclude that the comparison is potentially
affected by a number of issues, including uncertainties in interpreting the

the orientation of a halo CME elongation may correspond to the orientation of
the underlyig flux rope. Here we revisit these preliminary reports by comparing
orientation angles of elongated LASCO CMEs, both full and partial halos, to the
post eruption arcades. Based on 100 analysed events, it was found that the
overwhelming majority of halo CMEs are elongated in the direction of the axial
field of the post eruptio arcades. Moreover, this conclusion also holds for
partial halo CMEs as well as for events that originate further from the disk
center. This suggests that the projection effect does not drastically change
the appearance of full and partial halos and their imagesstill bear reliable
information about the underlying magnetic fields. We also compared orientations
of the erupted fields near the Sun and in the interplanetary space and found
that the local tiltof the coronal neutral line at 2.5 solar radii is well
correlated with the magnetic cloud axis measured near the Earth. We suggest
that the heliospheric magnetic fields significantly affect the propagating
ejecta. Sometimes, the ejecta may even rotate so that its axis locally aligns
itself with the heliospheric current sheet.

energy cosmic rays is to sample the lateral profile of the particle density on
the ground of the air shower with an array of surface detectors. For cosmic
rays with large inclinations, this reconstruction is based on a model of the
lateral profile of the muon density observed on the ground, which is fitted to
the observed muon densities in individual surface detectors. The best models
for this task are derived from detailed Monte-Carlo simulations of the air
shower development. We present a phenomenological parametrization scheme which
allows to derive a model of the average lateral profile of the muon density
directly from a fit to a set of individual Monte-Carlo simulated air showers.

conductance characteristics of a planar junction between a ferromagnet and a
noncentrosymmetric superconductor are studied. The effects of the Rashba
spin-orbit coupling (RSOC), the exchange energy, and the Fermi wave-vector
mismatch (FWM) on the conductance are all taken into account. In the absence of
the FWM, it is found that far away from the gap edge the conductance is
suppressed by the RSOC, while around the gap edge it is almost independent of
RSOC. The interplay of the RSOC and the exchange energy causes an enhancement
of the subgap conductance, which is more pronounced when the RSOC is small.
When the FWM is introduced, it is shown that the conductance is monotonically
enhanced as the FWM parameter decreases.

representation [Rajagopal, Mendes, and Lenzi, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 80}, 3907

agrees with the result obtained by the asymptotic approach valid for $O(q-1)$.
Model calculations have been made with a uniform density of states for
electrons and with the Debye model for phonons. Based on the result of the
exact approach, we have proposed the {\it interpolation approximation} to the
generalized distributions, which yields results in agreement with the exact
approach within $O(q-1)$ and in high- and low-temperature limits. By using the
four methods of the exact, interpolation, factorization and superstatistical
approaches, we have calculated coefficients in the generalized Sommerfeld
expansion, and electronic and phonon specific heats at low temperatures. A
comparison among the four methods has shown that the interpolation
approximation is potentially useful in the nonextensive quantum statistics.
Supplementary discussions have been made on the $(q-1)$ expansion of the
generalized distributions based on the exact approach with the use of the
un-normalized MEM, whose results also agree with those of the asymptotic

channels has gained popularity as a means of studying the flow of information
over wireless communication networks, and this approach generalizes the model
of wireline networks which is standard in network optimization. There is recent
work extending the celebrated max--flow/min--cut theorem to the capacity of a
unicast session over a linear deterministic relay network which is modeled by a
layered directed graph. This result was first proved by a random coding scheme
over large blocks of transmitted signals. We demonstrate the same result with a
simple, deterministic, polynomial--time algorithm which takes as input a single
transmitted signal instead of a long block of signals. Our capacity-achieving
transmission scheme for a two--layer network requires the extension of a
one--dimensional Rado--Hall transversal theorem on the independent subsets of
rows of a row--partitioned matrix into a two--dimensional variation for block
matrices. To generalize our approach to larger networks we use the
submodularity of the capacity of a cut for our model and show that our complete
transmission scheme can be obtained by solving a linear program over the
intersection of two polymatroids. We prove that our transmission scheme can
achieve the max-flow/min-cut capacity by applying a theorem of Edmonds about
such linear programs. We use standard submodular function minimization
techniques as part of our polynomial--time algorithm to construct our
capacity-achieving transmission scheme.

decayed, and the non-thermal soft X-ray spectral component fading faster than

INTEGRAL, which clearly detected the source up to ~100keV in the first

trivalent salt under the action of electric fields through computer
simulations. The chain is unfolded when the strength of the electric field is
stronger than a critical value. This critical electric field follows a scaling
law against chain length and the exponent of the scaling law is $-0.77(1)$,
smaller than the theoretical prediction, $-3\nu/2$ [Netz, Phys. Rev. Lett. 90
(2003) 128104], and the one obtained by simulations in tetravalent salt
solutions, $-0.453(3)$ [Hsiao and Wu, J. Phys. Chem. B 112 (2008) 13179]. It
demonstrates that the scaling exponent depends sensitively on the salt valence.
Hence, it is easier to unfold chains condensed by multivalent salt of smaller
valence. Moreover, the absolute value of chain electrophoretic mobility
increases drastically when the chain is unfolded in an electric field. The
dependence of the mobility on electric field and chain length provides a
plausible way to impart chain-length dependence in free-solution
electrophoresis via chain unfolding transition induced by electric fields.
Finally, we show that, in addition to an elongated structure, a condensed chain
can be unfolded into an U-shaped structure. The formation of this structure in
our study is purely a result of the electric polarization, but not of the
elasto-hydrodynamics dominated in sedimentation of polymers.

for any first-order sentence $\phi$ in the theory of graphs, as n approaches

approaches either 0 or 1. It is well known that this law fails to hold for any
formalism that can express the parity quantifier: for certain properties, the
probability that G(n, p) satisfies the property need not converge, and for
others the limit may be strictly between 0 and 1. In this paper, we capture the
limiting behavior of properties definable in first order logic augmented with
the parity quantier, FO[parity], over G(n, p), thus eluding the above hurdles.
Specifically, we establish the following ""modular convergence law"": For every
FO[parity] sentence $\phi$, there are two rational numbers a_0, a_1, such that
for i in {0,1}, as n approaches infinity, the probability that the random graph
G(2n+i, p) satisfies $\phi$ approaches a_i. Our results also extend
appropriately to first order logic equipped with Mod-q quantiers for prime q.
Our approach is based on multivariate polynomials over finite fields, in
particular, on a new generalization of the Gowers norm. The proof generalizes
the original quantifier elimination approach to the zero-one law, and has
analogies with the Razborov-Smolensky method for lower bounds for AC0 with

applications of logistics, inventory, etc. A generic problem in such systems is
to ensure that the RFID readers can reliably read a set of RFID tags, such that
the probability of missing tags stays below an acceptable value. A tag may be
missing (left unread) due to errors in the communication link towards the
reader e.g. due to obstacles in the radio path. The present paper proposes
techniques that use multiple reader sessions, during which the system of
readers obtains a running estimate of the probability to have at least one tag
missing. Based on such an estimate, it is decided whether an additional reader
session is required. Two methods are proposed, they rely on the statistical
independence of the tag reading errors across different reader sessions, which
is a plausible assumption when e.g. each reader session is executed on
different readers. The first method uses statistical relationships that are
valid when the reader sessions are independent. The second method is obtained
by modifying an existing capture-recapture estimator. The results show that,
when the reader sessions are independent, the proposed mechanisms provide a
good approximation to the probability of missing tags, such that the number of
reader sessions made, meets the target specification. If the assumption of
independence is violated, the estimators are still useful, but they should be
corrected by a margin of additional reader sessions to ensure that the target
probability of missing tags is met.

A well-known conjecture in astrophysics is that the steady state solutions

stable by the flow. This was proved at the linear level by several authors
based on the pioneering work by Antonov in 1961. Since then, standard
variational techniques based on concentration compactness methods as introduced
by P.-L. Lions in 1983 have led to the nonlinear stability of subclasses of

  In this paper, inspired by pioneering works from the physics litterature

monotonicity of the Hamiltonian under generalized symmetric rearrangement
transformations to prove that non increasing steady solutions are local
minimizer of the Hamiltonian under equimeasurable constraints, and extract
compactness from suitable minimizing sequences. This implies the nonlinear
stability of nonincreasing anisotropic steady states under radially symmetric

transition in a DGP brane world scenario within an effective model of QCD. We
study the evolution of the physical quantities useful for the study of the
early universe, namely, the energy density, temperature and the scale factor
before, during, and after the phase transition. Also, due to the high energy
density in the early universe, we consider the quadratic energy density term
that appears in the Friedmann equation. In DGP brane models such a term
corresponds to the negative branch (\epsilon=-1) of the Friedmann equation when
the Hubble radius is much smaller than the crossover length in 4D and 5D
regimes. We show that for different values of the cosmological constant on a
brane, \lambda, phase transition occurs and results in decreasing the effective
temperature of the quark-gluon plasma and of the hadronic fluid. We then
consider the quark-hadron transition in the smooth crossover regime at high and

the effective temperature of the quark-gluon plasma during the process of the

observe the deepest universe, and it is thus well suited for extragalactic

statistically reliable segment length, avoiding the need for unrealistic null

functions of pressure and shear stress are analyzed; the obtained fits are very
good, at least as good as with a stretched exponential. In contrast to the
stretched exponential, the key shape parameter--the exponent of the power-law
tail--seems to be the same for all three correlation functions. It decreases
from a value around 2 at high temperature to a value close to 1.58 (2D), 1.50
(3D) at low temperatures. The amplitude of the tail increases towards towards a
value corresponding to a diverging relaxation time, which is related to
anomalous diffusion. On the other hand, careful analysis of the long time
behavior in the case of suggests that the memory function is cut-off
exponentially, which avoids the divergence of the relaxation time. Repeating
the fits with an exponential cut-off included indicates that the power-law
exponent is in fact independent of temperature and close to 1.58/1.50 over the
whole range. Instead of the divergence, a fragile-to-strong crossover in the

short-time rate, the amount of decorrelation that occurs in a fixed, relatively
short time interval (compared to the alpha time). This quantity is observed to
have a near-Arrhenius temperature dependence, while its wavenumber dependence
seems to be diffusive ($q^{-2}$) over a wider range than that of the relaxation

associated with the difference in the surface area between the native (N) and
the denatured (D) state, which should be a function of DR_g^2, the difference
in the square of the radius of gyration between the D and N states. Single
molecule experiments show that the denatured state undergoes an equilibrium
collapse transition as [C] decreases, which implies m also should be
[C]-dependent. We resolve the conundrum between constant m-values and
[C]-dependent changes in Rg using molecular simulations of a coarse-grained
representation of protein L, and the Molecular Transfer Model, for which the
equilibrium folding can be accurately calculated as a function of denaturant
concentration. We find that over a large range of denaturant concentration (> 3
M) the m-value is a constant, whereas under strongly renaturing conditions (< 3
M) it depends on [C]. The m-value is a constant above [C]> 3 M because the
[C]-dependent changes in the surface area of the backbone groups, which make
the largest contribution to m, is relatively narrow in the denatured state. The
burial of the backbone gives rise to substantial surface area changes below
[C]< 3 M, leading to collapse in the denatured state. The midpoint of
transition of individual residues vary significantly even though global folding
can be described as an all-or-none transition. Collapse driven by the loss of
favorable residue-solvent interactions and a concomitant increase in the
strength of intrapeptide interactions with decreasing [C]. These interactions

Exact Cover, a multi-access channel problem, and composite models combining
sparse and dense interactions. The satisfiability problem in Exact Cover is
addressed using a statistical analysis of a simple branch and bound algorithm.
The algorithm can be formulated in the large system limit as a branching
process, for which critical properties can be analysed. Far from the critical
point a set of differential equations may be used to model the process, and
these are solved by numerical integration and exact bounding methods. The
multi-access channel problem is formulated as an equilibrium statistical
physics problem for the case of bit transmission on a channel with power
control and synchronisation. A sparse code division multiple access method is
considered and the optimal detection properties are examined in typical case by
use of the replica method, and compared to detection performance achieved by
iterative decoding methods. These codes are found to have phenomena closely
resembling the well-understood dense codes. The composite model is introduced
as an abstraction of canonical sparse and dense disordered spin models. The
model includes couplings due to both dense and sparse topologies
simultaneously. Through an exact replica analysis at high temperature, and
variational approaches at low temperature, several phenomena uncharacteristic
of either sparse or dense models are demonstrated. An extension of the
composite interaction structure to a code division multiple access method is
presented. The new type of codes are shown to outperform sparse and dense codes
in some regimes both in optimal performance, and in performance achieved by
iterative detection methods in finite systems.

One-Counter Markov Decision Processes (OC-MDPs), a class of finitely-presented,
countable-state MDPs. OC-MDPs are equivalent to a controlled extension of
(discrete-time) Quasi-Birth-Death processes (QBDs), a stochastic model studied
heavily in queueing theory and applied probability. They can thus be viewed as
a natural ``adversarial'' version of a classic stochastic model. Alternatively,
they can also be viewed as a natural probabilistic/controlled extension of
classic one-counter automata. OC-MDPs also subsume (as a very restricted
special case) a recently studied MDP model called ``solvency games'' that model
a risk-averse gambling scenario. Basic computational questions about these
models include ``termination'' questions and ``limit'' questions, such as the
following: does the controller have a ``strategy'' (or ``policy'') to ensure
that the counter (which may for example count the number of jobs in the queue)
will hit value 0 (the empty queue) almost surely (a.s.)? Or that it will have
infinite limsup value, a.s.? Or, that it will hit value 0 in selected terminal
states, a.s.? Or, in case these are not satisfied a.s., compute the maximum
(supremum) such probability over all strategies. We provide new upper and lower
bounds on the complexity of such problems. For some of them we present a
polynomial-time algorithm, whereas for others we show PSPACE- or BH-hardness
and give an EXPTIME upper bound. Our upper bounds combine techniques from the
theory of MDP reward models, the theory of random walks, and a variety of
automata-theoretic methods.

subtraction maps at the 1$^\circ$ angular resolution between the two
cosmological bands of V and W, for masked sky areas that avoid the Galactic
disk. The resulting $V-W$ map revealed a non-acoustic signal over and above the
WMAP5 pixel noise, with two main properties. Firstly, it possesses quadrupole
power at the $\approx$ 1 $\mu K$ level which may be attributed to foreground
residuals. Second, it fluctuates also at all values of $\ell >$ 2, especially

and certain other features naturally occur in {\it punctuated inflation}, i.e.
the scenario wherein a brief period of rapid roll is sandwiched between two
stages of slow roll inflation. Such spectra gain importance due to the fact
that they can lead to a better fit of the observed Cosmic Microwave Background
(CMB) anisotropies, when compared to the conventional, featureless, power law
spectrum. In this paper, with examples from the canonical scalar field as well
as the tachyonic models, we illustrate that, in punctuated inflation, a drop in
the scalar power on large scales is {\it always} accompanied by a rise in the
tensor power and, hence, an even more pronounced increase in the
tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ on these scales. Interestingly, we find that $r$
actually {\it exceeds well beyond unity} over a small range of scales. {\it To
our knowledge, this work presents for the first time, examples of single scalar
field inflationary models wherein $r\gg 1$.} This feature opens up interesting
possibilities. For instance, we show that the rise in $r$ on large scales
translates to a rapid increase in the angular power spectrum, $C_{\ell}^{\rm
BB}$, of the B-mode polarization of the CMB at the low multipoles. We discuss
the observational implications of these results.

there exist infinitely many consecutive primes $p_n$ and $p_{n+1}$ such that
$p_{n+1}-p_n=2k$. A weakened form of this conjecture states that for every
$k\geq1$, there exist infinitely many primes $p$ and $q$ such that $p-q=2k$.
Clearly, the weakened form of Polignac's conjecture implies that there exists
an infinite sequence of positive integers $x_1,x_2,...,x_m,...$ such that $x_1
(2k+x_1),x_2 (2k+x_2),...,x_m (2k+x_m)...$ are pairwise relatively prime. In
this note, we obtain a slightly stronger result than this necessary condition.
This enables us to find a common property on some special kinds of
number-theoretic functions (such as $2^x -1 $) which likely represent
infinitely many primes by rich literatures and a lot of research reports.
However, the function $2^{2^x}+1$ does not have this property. Does it imply
that the number of Fermat primes is finite? Hardy and Wright [7] conjectured
that the number of Fermat primes is finite. Nevertheless, they did not give any
reasons and explanations. By factoring Fermat number, many people believe that
the conjecture in [7] holds. Does our work explain this phenomenon? We will
consider further this problem in another paper. Based on our work, one could
give a new sufficient condition that there are an infinite number of twin
primes (Sophie-Germain primes or Mersenne primes).

a direct consequence of the stringent experimental constraint on epsilon_K,
provided that the NP enters with comparable strength and a universal weak phase
in both Delta S = 2 and Delta S = 1 transitions. This happens in many NP
scenarios with either only SM operators, or where the NP induces exclusively
right-handed currents while the left-right Delta S = 2 operators are absent. On
the other hand, if the NP phases in Delta S = 2 and Delta S = 1 processes are
uncorrelated, epsilon_K has no power to put constraints on the K -> pi nu
anti-nu system. The latter appears in particular in those NP models where K^0 -
anti-K^0 mixing receives contributions from the chirally enhanced left-right
operators. We discuss the stability of the correlation in question against
small deviations from the assumption of universal Delta S = 2 and Delta S = 1
weak phases, and in the presence of non-negligible NP contributions to
epsilon_K.

  assumptions or binning gives probability of 1.5x10-4",,,"4/15/2005","astro-ph.CO astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this article I extend an earlier study of spiral galaxies in the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to investigate whether the universe has an overall
handedness. A preference for spiral galaxies in one sector of the sky to be
left-handed or right-handed spirals would indicate a parity-violating asymmetry
in the overall universe and a preferred axis. The previous study used 2616
spiral galaxies with redshifts <0.04 and identified handedness. The new study
uses 15158 with redshifts <0.085 and obtains very similar results to the first
with a signal exceeding 5 sigma, corresponding to a probability ~2.5x10-7 for
occurring by chance. A similar asymmetry is seen in the Southern Galaxy spin
catalog of Iye and Sugai. The axis of the dipole asymmetry lies at approx. (l,
b) =(52 d, 68.5 d), roughly along that of our Galaxy and close to alignments
observed in the WMAP cosmic microwave background distributions.
