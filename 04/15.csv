mid-latitudes, in combination with measurements of electron and positron fuxes
from PAMELA, Fermi and HESS within the context of three possible sources: dark
matter (DM) annihilation or decay into charged leptons, and a continuum
distribution of pulsars. We allow for variations in the backgrounds, consider
several DM halo profiles, and account for systematic uncertainties in data
where possible. We find that all three scenarios represent the data well. The
pulsar description holds for a wide range of injection energy spectra. We
compare with ATIC data and the WMAP haze where appropriate, but do not fit
these data since the former are discrepant with Fermi data and the latter are
subject to large systematic uncertainties. We show that for cusped halo
profiles, Fermi could observe a spectacular gamma-ray signal of DM annihilation
from the galactic center while seeing no excess at mid-latitudes.

the second realization of the ICRF2 catalogue. The criteria of best sources
selection (in terms of coordinates stability) must be defined as the first aim.
The selected sources have to keep stable the coordinate axes of inertial
astronomical frame.
  Here we propose new criteria of source selection for the new ICRF catalogue.
The first one we call as ""cosmological"" and the second one as ""kinematical"".
The physical basis of these criteria is based on the assumption that apparent
motion of quasars (at angular scale of the order of hundred microarcseconds) is
connected with real motion inside quasars. Therefore apparent angular motion
corresponds to real physical motion of a ""hot spot"" inside a radio source. It
is shown that interval of redshift $0.8 \div 3.0$ is the most favorable in
terms that physical shift inside such sources corresponds to minimal apparent
angular shift of a ""hot spot"". Among ""cosmologically"" selected sources we
propose to select motionless sources and sources with linear motion which are
predictable and stable over long time interval.
  To select sources which satisfies such conditions we analyzed known redshifts
of sources and time series obtained by our code and by different centers of
analysis of VLBI data. As a result of these analyses we select 137 sources as a
basis for the ICRF2 catalogue.

same procedure was applied to a reference sample of BCDs, and in this case the
two metallicities agree, being also consistent with the stellar metallicity in
QBCDs. Chemical evolution models indicate that the gas metallicity of QBCDs is
too high to be representative of the galaxy as a whole, but it can represent a
small fraction of the galactic gas, self enriched by previous starbursts. The

proposed. For every encountered atom, we take multiple samples of its thermal
displacements among those which result in scattering with high probability to
finally reach the detector. As a result, the detector is illuminated by
intensive ""showers"", where each event of detection must be weighted according
to the actual probability of the atom displacement. The computational cost of
such simulation is orders of magnitude lower than in the direct approach and a
comprehensive analysis of multiple and plural scattering effects becomes
possible. We use the new method for two purposes. First, the accuracy of the
approximate approaches, developed mainly for ion-beam structural analysis, is
verified. Second, the possibility to reproduce a wide class of experimental
conditions is used to analyze some basic features of ion-solid collisions: the
role of double violent collisions in low-energy ion scattering; the origin of
the ""surface peak"" in scattering from amorphous samples; the low-energy tail in
the energy spectra of scattered medium-energy ions due to plural scattering;
the degradation of blocking patterns in 2D angular distributions with
increasing depth of scattering. As an example of simulation for ions of MeV
energies, we verify the time-reversibility for channeling/blocking of 1 MeV
protons in a W crystal. The possibilities of analysis that our approach offers
may be very useful for various applications in particular for structural
analysis with atomic resolution.

modeling and mining temporal data. On the one hand, approaches such as dynamic
Bayesian networks (DBNs) provide a formal probabilistic basis to model
relationships between time-indexed random variables but these models are
intractable to learn in the general case. On the other, algorithms such as
frequent episode mining are scalable to large datasets but do not exhibit the
rigorous probabilistic interpretations that are the mainstay of the graphical
models literature.
  Results: We present a unification of these two seemingly diverse threads of
research, by demonstrating how dynamic (discrete) Bayesian networks can be
inferred from the results of frequent episode mining. This helps bridge the
modeling emphasis of the former with the counting emphasis of the latter.
First, we show how, under reasonable assumptions on data characteristics and on
influences of random variables, the optimal DBN structure can be computed using
a greedy, local, algorithm. Next, we connect the optimality of the DBN
structure with the notion of fixed-delay episodes and their counts of distinct
occurrences. Finally, to demonstrate the practical feasibility of our approach,
we focus on a specific (but broadly applicable) class of networks, called
excitatory networks, and show how the search for the optimal DBN structure can
be conducted using just information from frequent episodes. Application on
datasets gathered from mathematical models of spiking neurons as well as real
neuroscience datasets are presented.

is the sigma mass which appears in the Lagrangian and is the only a priori
unknown parameter in the model. This induces an infinite series for every
predicted scattering length in which each term corresponds to a given order in
the chiral perturbation theory counting.

values, of chiral perturbation theory predictions for both the isotopic spin 0

from C2H2 affect all radius measurements at 3 micron and in the N-band,
resulting in higher values for the UD-radii. The predicted behaviour of

periodic driving, the response may exhibit exotic freezing behavior in high
driving frequency ($\omega$) regime. In a periodically driven classical
thermodynamic system, freezing at high $\omega$ occurs when $1/\omega$ is much
smaller than the characteristic relaxation time of the system, and hence the
freezing always increases there as $\omega$ is increased. Here, in the
contrary, we see surprising non-monotonic freezing behavior of the response
with $\omega$, showing curious peak-valley structure. Quite interestingly, the
entire system tends to freeze almost absolutely (the freezing peaks) when
driven with a certain combination of driving parameters values (amplitude and
$\omega$) due to coherent suppression of dynamics of the quantum many-body
modes, which has no classical analog. We demonstrate this new freezing
phenomenon analytically (supported by large-scale numerics) for a general class
of integrable quantum spin systems.

this scale. The CP asymmetry that generates the observed matter-antimatter
asymmetry manifests itself in a difference between the number of positive and
negative like-sign dileptons N(\ell^+\ell^+)-N(\ell^-\ell^-) that arise in the
decay of the new Z' gauge boson to two right-handed neutrinos N, and their
subsequent decay to leptons. The relatively low efficiency of resonant
leptogenesis in this class of models implies that the CP asymmetry, \epsilon,

the baryon asymmetry of the Universe, \emph{an excess of antileptons is
predicted}. We identify the domains in M_{Z'}--M_N space where such a direct

this material that provide an understanding of the superconductivity. Since the
information about the Fermi surface is available both from photoemission and
band structure calculations for FeTe, FeSe and other related materials the
neutron spectra can be used to see if the itinerant electron picture is valid.
The results are consistent with a picture where there are both electron and
hole Fermi surfaces that make exact (pi,pi) transitions possible. This would
normally favor either a spin or charge density wave state. However, our
measurements show the extent of the region where (pi,pi) transitions take place
and demonstrate that there are a much larger number of transitions near pi,pi).
The near (pi,pi) transitions are observed both above and below Tc and are
expected to be strongly pairing. The superconductivity can be attributed to
these excitations while the exactly (pi,pi) transitions produce the narrow

tbar-b/bbar-t channels, even if the third generation quarks are not composite
at the TeV scale. These states couple sufficiently strongly to third generation
quarks to have significant production at LHC via gg \to X or gb \to X. The
existence of narrow resonances in QCD suggests that the strong electroweak
breaking sector contains narrow resonances that decay to tbar-t or
tbar-b/bbar-t, with significant branching fractions to 3 or more longitudinal W
and Z bosons. These may give new ""smoking gun"" signals of strong electroweak
symmetry breaking.

induce a sizeable depletion of low momenta in the ground state of a nuclear
many-body system. The self-consistent Green's function method within the ladder
approximation provides an \textit{ab-initio} description of correlated nuclear
systems that accounts properly for these effects. The momentum distribution
predicted by this approach is analyzed in detail, with emphasis on the
depletion of the lowest momentum state. The temperature, density, and nucleon
asymmetry (isospin) dependence of the depletion of the Fermi sea is clarified.
A connection is established between the momentum distribution and the
time-ordered components of the self-energy, which allows for an improved
interpretation of the results. The dependence on the underlying nucleon-nucleon
interaction provides quantitative estimates of the importance of short-range

as mass peaks in convergence maps of 8.6 sq. deg of R band imaging, and
followed up with X-ray and spectroscopic confirmation, spanning a redshift
range 0.19 - 0.68. Most clusters contained multiple X-ray peaks, yielding 17
total mass concentrations. In this paper, we constrain the masses of these
X-ray sources with weak lensing, using photometric redshifts from the full set
of BVRz' imaging to properly weight background galaxies according to their
lensing distance ratios. We fit both NFW and singular isothermal sphere
profiles, and find that the results are insensitive to the assumed profile. We
also show that the results do not depend significantly on the assumed prior on
the position of the mass peak, but that this may become an issue in future
larger samples. The inferred velocity dispersions for the extended X-ray
sources range from 250-800 km/s, with the exception of one source for which no
lensing signal was found. This work further establishes shear selection as a
viable technique for finding clusters, but also highlights some unresolved
issues such as determination of the mass profile center without biasing the
mass estimate, and fully accounting for line-of-sight projections. A follow-up
paper will examine the mass-X-ray scaling relations of these clusters.

becomes well defined only modulo 8. We illustrate this in the microscopic model
of the Majorana chain by constructing an explicit path between two distinct
free phases whose topological invariants are equal modulo 8, along which the
system remains gapped. The path goes through a strongly interacting region. We
also find the field theory interpretation of this phenomenon. There is a second
order phase transition between the two phases in the free theory which can be
avoided by going through the strongly interacting region. We show that this
transition is in the 2D Ising universality class, where a first order phase
transition line, terminating at a second order transition, can be avoided by
going through the analogue of a high temperature paramagnetic phase. In fact,
we construct the full phase diagram of the system as a function of the thermal

various constant factor approximations are known, with the current best ratio
of 3. Our main result is a {\em weakly robust} polynomial time approximation
scheme (PTAS) for UDGs expressed with edge-lengths, it either (i) computes a
clique partition or (ii) gives a certificate that the graph is not a UDG; for
the case (i) that it computes a clique partition, we show that it is guaranteed
to be within $(1+\eps)$ ratio of the optimum if the input is UDG; however if
the input is not a UDG it either computes a clique partition as in case (i)
with no guarantee on the quality of the clique partition or detects that it is
not a UDG. Noting that recognition of UDG's is NP-hard even if we are given
edge lengths, our PTAS is a weakly-robust algorithm. Our algorithm can be
transformed into an $O(\frac{\log^* n}{\eps^{O(1)}})$ time distributed PTAS.
  We consider a weighted version of the clique partition problem on vertex
weighted UDGs that generalizes the problem. We note some key distinctions with
the unweighted version, where ideas useful in obtaining a PTAS breakdown. Yet,
surprisingly, it admits a $(2+\eps)$-approximation algorithm for the weighted
case where the graph is expressed, say, as an adjacency matrix. This improves
on the best known 8-approximation for the {\em unweighted} case for UDGs
expressed in standard form.

Selection of a persistent lengthscale, or coarsening (increase of the

conditions one dynamics prevails over the other is a longstanding problem,
particularly beyond one dimension. It is shown that the challenge can be defied
in two dimensions, using the concept of phase diffusion equation. We find that

features of QFT to the foreground. However, the understanding of Symmetry
Breaking that is used here is quite different from what is done in the
mainstream: Symmetry Breaking is understood as the solution set of a given QFT,
its vacuum manifold, or, more modernly, its Moduli Space. Distinct solutions
correspond to different sectors, phases, of the theory, which are nothing but
distinct foliations of the vacuum manifold, or points in the Moduli Space (for
all possible values of the parameters of the theory). Under this framework,
three different problems will be attacked: ""Mollifying QFT"", ""Topological
Transitions and Geometric Langlands Duality"" and ""Three-dimensional Gravity and
its Phase Transitions"". The first makes use of the Moduli Space of the theory
in order to construct an appropriate mollification of it, rendering it viable
to simulate a QFT in Lorentzian spaces, tackling the ""sign problem"" heads-on.
The connections with Lee-Yang zeros and Stokes Phenomena will be made clear.
The second will show that each different phase has its own topology which can
be used as Superselection Rule; moreover, the Euler Characteristic of each
phase gives it quantization condition. The mechanism via which several
dualities work will also be elucidated. The last one will generalize a
0-dimensional QFT, via dimensional construction through its D-Module, and
conjecture several connections between the Lie-algebra-valued extension of the
Airy function and the recent Partition Function found for three-dimensional
gravity with a negative cosmological constant. These three problems, put
together, should exhibit a solid and robust framework for treating QFT under
this new paradigm.

(where P_{0.2} is the real space galaxy power spectrum at k=0.2h/Mpc and
redshift z) gives a good approximation of the observed galaxy number density

assuming nP_{0.2}=3, but the latter corresponds to a galaxy number density
larger by ~70% at z=2. We show how the Figure-of-Merit (FoM) for constraining
dark energy depends on the assumed galaxy number density, redshift accuracy,
redshift range, survey area, and the systematic errors due to calibration and

rebrightening and the subsequent evolution of the light curve. The exponential

  complex disorders captured in multiple traits",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Identifying shared genetic risk factors for multiple measured traits has been
of great interest in studying complex disorders. Marlow's (2003) method for
detecting shared gene effects on complex traits has been highly influential in
the literature of neurodevelopmental disorders as well as other disorders
including obesity and asthma. Although its method has been widely applied and
has been recommended as potentially powerful, the validity and power of this
method have not been examined either theoretically or by simulation. This paper
establishes the validity and quantifies and explains the power of the method.
We show the method has correct type 1 error rates regardless of the number of
traits in the model, and confirm power increases compared to standard
univariate methods across different genetic models. We discover the main source
of these power gains is correlations among traits induced by a common major
gene effect component. We compare the use of the complete pleiotropy model, as
assumed by Marlow, to the use of a more general model allowing additional
correlation parameters, and find that even when the true model includes those
parameters, the complete pleiotropy model is more powerful as long as traits
are moderately correlated by a major gene component. We implement this method
and a power calculator in software that can assist in designing studies by
using pilot data to calculate required sample sizes and choose traits for
further linkage studies. We apply the software to data on reading disability in
the Russian language.

use first classical Taylor expansions for the nonlinear coefficients of the
SPDE and then to insert recursively the mild presentation of the solution of
the SPDE. The iteration of this idea allows us to derive stochastic Taylor

of photons to be in a good agreement with the newest experimental data for the

signal transduction module of phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle (PdPC).
It utilizes multiple kinetic cycles in time, in contrast to allosteric
cooperativity that utilizes multiple subunits in a protein. In the present
paper, we thoroughly investigate both the deterministic (microscopic) and
stochastic (mesoscopic) models, and focus on the identification of the source
of temporal cooperativity via comparing with allosteric cooperativity.
  A thermodynamic analysis confirms again the claim that the chemical
equilibrium state exists if and only if the phosphorylation potential
$\triangle G=0$, in which case the amplification of sensitivity is completely
abolished. Then we provide comprehensive theoretical and numerical analysis
with the first-order and zero-order assumptions in
phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle respectively. Furthermore, it is
interestingly found that the underlying mathematics of temporal cooperativity
and allosteric cooperativity are equivalent, and both of them can be expressed
by ""dissociation constants"", which also characterizes the essential differences
between the simple and ultrasensitive PdPC switches. Nevertheless, the degree
of allosteric cooperativity is restricted by the total number of sites in a
single enzyme molecule which can not be freely regulated, while temporal
cooperativity is only restricted by the total number of molecules of the target
protein which can be regulated in a wide range and gives rise to the
ultrasensitivity phenomenon.

fluctuations around the critical point(CP) of Quantum Chromodynamics(QCD) using
dissipative relativistic fluid dynamics in which the coupling of the density
fluctuations to those of other conserved quantities is taken into account. We
show that the sound mode which is directly coupled to the mechanical density
fluctuation is attenuated and in turn the thermal mode becomes the genuine soft
mode at the QCD CP. We give a speculation on the possible fate of a Mach cone
in the vicinity of the QCD CP as a signal of the existence of the CP on the
basis of the above findings. Secondly, we clarify that the so called
first-order relativistic fluid dynamic equations have generically no problem to
describe fluid dynamic phenomena with long wave lengths contrary to a naive
suspect whereas even Israel-Stewart equation, a popular second-order equation,
may not describe the hydrodynamic mode in general depending on the value of the
relaxation time.

functions, such that a state describing n particles depends on n spacetime
positions. Since a general state is a superposition of states with different
numbers of particles, the wave function lives in the configuration space
identified with a product of an infinite number of 4-dimensional Minkowski
spacetimes. The squared absolute value of the wave function is interpreted as
the probability density in the configuration space, from which the standard
probabilistic predictions of QFT can be recovered. Such a formulation and
probabilistic interpretation of QFT allows to interpret the wave function as a
pilot wave that describes deterministic particle trajectories, which
automatically includes a deterministic and continuous description of particle
creation and destruction. In particular, when the conditional wave function
associated with a quantum measurement ceases to depend on one of the spacetime
coordinates, then the 4-velocity of the corresponding particle vanishes,
describing a trajectory that stops at a particular point in spacetime. In a
more general situation a dependence on this spacetime coordinate is negligibly
small but not strictly zero, in which case the trajectory does not stop but the
measuring apparatus still behaves as if this particle has been destroyed.

issue for wireless communication systems, but it is hard to prove in particular
scenarios. In this paper two simple conditions for stability in broadcast
channels are derived, which are easy to check. Heuristically, the conditions
imply that if the queue length in the system becomes large, the rate allocation
is always the solution of a weighted sum rate maximization problem.
Furthermore, the change of the weight factors between two time slots becomes
smaller and the weight factors of the users, whose queues are bounded while the
other queues expand, tend to zero. Then it is shown that for any mean arrival
rate vector inside the ergodic achievable rate region the system is stable in
the strong sense when the given scheduling policy complies with the conditions.
In this case the policy is so-called throughput-optimal. Subsequently, some
results on the necessity of the presented conditions are provided. Finally, in
several application examples it is shown that the results in the paper provide
a convenient way to verify the throughput-optimal policies.

protected couplings in four dimensions, such as the hypermultiplet metric in
type II string theories compactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold. In either case,
the D-instanton series is therefore asymptotic, much like the perturbative

homogeneous, and isotropic turbulence is studied by means of direct numerical
simulations at two values of the Taylor-scale Reynolds number $Re_{\lambda}
\sim 200$ and 400. The evolution of both heavy and light particle pairs is
analysed at varying the particle Stokes number and the fluid-to-particle
density ratio. For heavy particles, it is found that turbulent dispersion is
schematically governed by two temporal regimes. The first is dominated by the
presence, at large Stokes numbers, of small-scale caustics in the particle
velocity statistics, and it lasts until heavy particle velocities have relaxed
towards the underlying flow velocities. At such large scales, a second regime
starts where heavy particles separate as tracers particles would do. As a
consequence, at increasing inertia, a larger transient stage is observed, and
the Richardson diffusion of simple tracers is recovered only at large times and
large scales. These features also arise from a statistical closure of the
equation of motion for heavy particle separation that is proposed, and which is
supported by the numerical results. In the case of light particles with high
density ratios, strong small-scale clustering leads to a considerable fraction
of pairs that do not separate at all, although the mean separation increases
with time. This effect strongly alters the shape of the probability density
function of light particle separations.

056404 (2009); arXiv:0809:0950], Phillips criticizes one specific issue
discussed in our paper, concerning the spectral weight transfer, among our
wide-ranging clarifications of the filling-control Mott transition. Here we
show that all his criticisms have nothing to do with our contributions. Our
nontrivial finding on this particular aspect is a very quick, non-linear
increase in the spectral weight just above the chemical potential caused by
tiny doping to the Mott insulator, which is indeed unprecedented in the
literature. We call attention to its novelty in comparison with the
perturbation theory, and reemphasize our picture for the quick weight transfer,
that is, an avalanchine screening of doublon-holon binding energy.

dwarf with a mass of $\sim 0.5 M_{\odot}$ and an M dwarf secondary star with a
mass of $\sim 0.2 M_{\odot}$. Based on the data detected by the high-speed CCD
camera ULTRACAM, it was observed that the orbital period of NN Ser is
decreasing, which may be caused by a genuine angular momentum loss or the
presence of a third body. However, neither gravitational radiation and magnetic
braking can ideally account for the period change of NN Ser. In this Letter, we
attempt to examine a feasible mechanism which can drain the angular momentum
from NN Ser. We propose that a fossil circumbinary disk (CB disk) around the
binary may have been established at the end of the common envelope phase, and
the tidal torques caused by the gravitational interaction between the disk and
the binary can efficiently extract the orbital angular momentum from the
system. We find that only if M dwarf has an ultra-high wind loss rates of $\sim
10^{-10} M_{\odot} \rm yr^{-1}$, and a large fraction ($\delta\sim 10 %$) of
wind loss is fed into the CB disk, the loss rates of angular momentum via the
CB disk can interpret the period change observed in NN Ser. Such a wind loss
rate and $\delta$-value seem to be incredible. Hence it seems that the presence
of a third body in a long orbit around the binary might account for the
changing period of NN Ser.

  Multi-agent Learning","11 pages",,,,"cs.MA cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Experimental verification has been the method of choice for verifying the
stability of a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm as the
number of agents grows and theoretical analysis becomes prohibitively complex.
For cooperative agents, where the ultimate goal is to optimize some global
metric, the stability is usually verified by observing the evolution of the
global performance metric over time. If the global metric improves and
eventually stabilizes, it is considered a reasonable verification of the
system's stability.
  The main contribution of this note is establishing the need for better
experimental frameworks and measures to assess the stability of large-scale
adaptive cooperative systems. We show an experimental case study where the
stability of the global performance metric can be rather deceiving, hiding an
underlying instability in the system that later leads to a significant drop in
performance. We then propose an alternative metric that relies on agents' local
policies and show, experimentally, that our proposed metric is more effective
(than the traditional global performance metric) in exposing the instability of
MARL algorithms.

complex dynamical process resulting from an intricate interplay of multiple

cell migration is an active biological process putting a characterization in

anomalous dynamics characterizes cell migration. A superdiffusive increase of
the mean squared displacement, non-Gaussian spatial probability distributions,

accretion rates as $\tautev\propto \dot{M}^{2.5-5.0}$; (2) black hole spins;
and (3) location of the TeV source. Jointly considering the optical depth and
the spectral energy distribution radiated from the RIAFs, the strong
degeneration of the spin with the other free parameters in the RIAF model can
be largely relaxed. We apply the present model to M87, wherein the RIAFs are
expected to be at work, and find that the minimum specific angular momentum of
the hole is $a\sim0.8$. The present methodology is applicable to M87-like
sources with future detection of TeV emissions to constrain the spins of SMBHs.

sheaves on a primitive multiple curve. These conditions are used to prove that
some moduli spaces of stable sheaves are not empty. We study mainly the quasi
locally free sheaves of generic type (this includes the locally free sheaves).
These sheaves are generic, i.e. for every moduli space of torsion free sheaves,
the sheaves of this type correspond to an open subset of the moduli space.

measurements of a chemically synthesized InAs nanowire. Both the temperature,
T, and transverse magnetic field dependences of the nanowire conductance are
consistent with the functional forms predicted in one-dimensional (1D) weak
localization theory. By fitting the magneto-conductance data to theory, the
phase coherence length of electrons is determined to be tens of nanometers with
a T-1/3 dependence. Moreover, as the electron density is increased by a gate
voltage, the magneto-conductance shows a possible signature of suppression of
weak localization in multiple 1D subbands.

systems to serve as quantum ratchets producing the in-plane directed current
from zero-mean time-dependent electric fields. The effective-mass swap ratchet
is based on modulation of the mobility through alteration of the electron's
effective mass. Modulation of the strength of the effective in-plane electric
field marks the skin-effect ratchet. They can generate both linear and circular
photocurrents, the later taking place in the dissipationless regime.

a non expansive operator $J$ and a corresponding family of strictly contracting
operators $\Phi(\lambda,x):=\lambda J(\frac{1-\lambda}{\lambda}x)$ for
$\lambda\in]0,1]$. Our motivation comes from the study of two-player zero-sum
repeated games, where the value of the $n$-stage game (resp. the value of the
$\lambda$-discounted game) satisfies the relation
$v_n=\Phi(\frac{1}{n},v_{n-1})$ (resp. $v_\lambda=\Phi(\lambda,v_\lambda)$)
where $J$ is the Shapley operator of the game. We study the evolution equation
$u'(t)=J(u(t))-u(t)$ as well as associated Eulerian schemes, establishing a new
exponential formula and a Kobayashi-like inequality for such trajectories. We
prove that the solution of the non-autonomous evolution equation
$u'(t)=\Phi(\bm{\lambda}(t),u(t))-u(t)$ has the same asymptotic behavior (even
when it diverges) as the sequence $v_n$ (resp. as the family $v_\lambda$) when
$\bm{\lambda}(t)=1/t$ (resp. when $\bm{\lambda}(t)$ converges slowly enough to
0).
