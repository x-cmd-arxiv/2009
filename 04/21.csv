scintillation pulse shapes of electron and nuclear recoil events and to
demonstrate the feasibility of pulse-shape discrimination (PSD) down to an
electron-equivalent energy of 20 keV.
  In the surface dataset using a triple-coincidence tag we found the fraction
of beta events that are misidentified as nuclear recoils to be $<1.4\times
10^{-7}$ (90% C.L.) for energies between 43-86 keVee and for a nuclear recoil
acceptance of at least 90%, with 4% systematic uncertainty on the absolute
energy scale. The discrimination measurement on surface was limited by nuclear
recoils induced by cosmic-ray generated neutrons. This was improved by moving
the detector to the SNOLAB underground laboratory, where the reduced background
rate allowed the same measurement with only a double-coincidence tag.
  The combined data set contains $1.23\times10^8$ events. One of those, in the
underground data set, is in the nuclear-recoil region of interest. Taking into
account the expected background of 0.48 events coming from random pileup, the
resulting upper limit on the electronic recoil contamination is
$<2.7\times10^{-8}$ (90% C.L.) between 44-89 keVee and for a nuclear recoil
acceptance of at least 90%, with 6% systematic uncertainty on the absolute
energy scale.
  We developed a general mathematical framework to describe PSD parameter
distributions and used it to build an analytical model of the distributions
observed in DEAP-1. Using this model, we project a misidentification fraction
of approx. $10^{-10}$ for an electron-equivalent energy threshold of 15 keV for
a detector with 8 PE/keVee light yield. This reduction enables a search for
spin-independent scattering of WIMPs from 1000 kg of liquid argon with a
WIMP-nucleon cross-section sensitivity of $10^{-46}$ cm$^2$, assuming
negligible contribution from nuclear recoil backgrounds.

the similarities between the quark and lepton mixing matrices, V and U, arguing
that the relative smallness of one element in each suggests common constraints.
These constraints link the smallness of V_ub and U_e3 with each other, and with
the approximate mu-tau symmetry observed in leptonic mixing, together with a
prediction of a large Dirac CP phase in both the quark and lepton sectors. In

this question by considering, theoretically, vortex nucleation in a rotating

the mean-field framework, the jump in symmetry occurs through a turbulent phase

characterize bars through ellipse-fitting, and other morphological features
through visual classification. (1) We explore three commonly used methods for
selecting disk galaxies. We find 625, 485, and 353 disk galaxies, respectively,
via visual classification, a single component S'ersic cut (n <= 2.5), and a
blue-cloud cut. In cluster environments, the latter two methods miss 31% and
51%, respectively, of visually-identified disks. (2) For moderately inclined
disks, the three methods of disk selection yield a similar global optical bar
fraction (f_bar-opt) of 34% +10%/-3%, 31% +10%/-3%, and 30% +10%/-3%,
respectively. (3) f_bar-opt rises in brighter galaxies and those which appear
to have no significant bulge component. Within a given absolute magnitude bin,
f_bar-opt is higher in visually-selected disk galaxies that have no bulge as
opposed to those with bulges. For a given morphological class, f_bar-opt rises
at higher luminosities. (4) For bright early-types, as well as faint late-type
systems with no evident bulge, the optical bar fraction in the Abell 901/2
clusters is comparable within a factor of 1.1 to 1.4 to that of field galaxies
at lower redshifts (5) Between the core and the virial radius of the cluster at
intermediate environmental densities, the optical bar fraction does not appear
to depend strongly on the local environment density and varies at most by a
factor of ~1.3. We discuss the implications of our results for the evolution of

be described in terms of Generalized Parton Distributions, particularly the
chiral odd subset. Chiral odd GPDs are related to transversity and can be
accessed experimentally for various special choices of observables. This is
accomplished by choosing C-parity odd and chiral odd combinations of t-channel
exchange quantum numbers. These GPDs are calculated in a spectator model, and
are constrained by boundary functions. Alternatively, the production amplitudes
correspond to C-odd Regge exchanges with final state interactions. The helicity
structure of the virtual photoproduction amplitudes provides relations between
the partonic description via GPDs and the hadronic, Regge description of C-odd
processes, all via quark helicity flip. GPDs, in general, are analytic
functions of energy variables. Their integrals over unobservable parton momenta
thereby satisfy Dispersion Relations (DR). Using DR's could allow the real part
of the amplitudes, the integrated GPDs, to be extracted from the more easily
measured imaginary parts. However, at non-zero momentum transfer DRs require
integration over unphysical regions of the variables. We show that the relevant
unphysical region of the non-forward DRs is considerable. This will vitiate the
efforts to avoid the actual measurement of the real parts more directly.

limit amounts to solve a functional self-consistent equation. In this paper we
obtain this equation for the Bose-Hubbard model on the Bethe lattice, under two
equivalent forms. The first one, based on a coherent state path integral, leads
in the large connectivity limit to the mean field treatment of Fisher et al.
[Phys. Rev. B {\bf 40}, 546 (1989)] at the leading order, and to the bosonic
Dynamical Mean Field Theory as a first correction, as recently derived by
Byczuk and Vollhardt [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 77}, 235106 (2008)]. We obtain an
alternative form of the equation using the occupation number representation,
which can be easily solved with an arbitrary numerical precision, for any
finite connectivity. We thus compute the transition line between the superfluid
and Mott insulator phases of the model, along with thermodynamic observables
and the space and imaginary time dependence of correlation functions. The
finite connectivity of the Bethe lattice induces a richer physical content with
respect to its infinitely connected counterpart: a notion of distance between
sites of the lattice is preserved, and the bosons are still weakly mobile in
the Mott insulator phase. The Bethe lattice construction can be viewed as an
approximation to the finite dimensional version of the model. We show indeed a
quantitatively reasonable agreement between our predictions and the results of
Quantum Monte Carlo simulations in two and three dimensions.

accretion shocks on the stellar surface, fluorescence on circumstellar disks

they are the main sources of ionizing radiation, mechanical energy and chemical
enrichment in galaxies. High-energy emission permits to probe some of the most
important processes at work in these stars, and put constraints on their most
peculiar feature: the stellar wind. Here, we review recent advances in our
understanding of cool and hot stars through the study of X-ray spectra, in

Gradient radiative transfer calculations, the aims of this study are (1) to
determine the density of the gas, (2) to constrain the temperature of the

the interstellar medium) we obtain about 2000 cm-3 for the gas density of the
south-western absorption component. Again toward the south-western source,
excitation temperatures of molecular species with optically thin lines and
higher rotational constants are, on average, consistent with the expected
temperature of the cosmic microwave background, T_CMB = 5.14 K. However,
individually, there is a surprisingly large scatter which far surpasses
expected uncertainties. A comparison of CS J=1-0 and 4-3 optical depths toward
the weaker north-western absorption component results in an excitation
temperature of 11 K and a 1-sigma error of 3 K. For the south-eastern main
component, a comparison of velocities determined from ten optically thin NH3
inversion lines with those from five optically thin rotational transitions of
HC3N, observed at similar frequencies, constrains potential variations of the
proton-to-electron mass ratio, with respect to its present value, to <1.4 x
10^-6 with 3-sigma confidence. Also including optically thin rotational lines
from other molecular species, it is emphasized that systematic errors are
smaller than 1 km/s, corresponding to an uncertainty of 10-6.

the existence of a root in each tree, in order to make it possible to keep
using the trees uninterruptedly (to a possible extent). Our algorithm operates
at a coarse-grain level, using atomic pairwise interactions in a way akin to
recent population protocol models. The algorithm relies on a perpetual
alternation of \emph{topology-induced splittings} and \emph{computation-induced
mergings} of a forest of spanning trees. Each tree in the forest hosts exactly
one token (also called root) that performs a random walk {\em inside} the tree,
switching parent-child relationships as it crosses edges. When two tokens are
located on both sides of a same edge, their trees are merged upon this edge and
one token disappears. Whenever an edge that belongs to a tree disappears, its
child endpoint regenerates a new token instantly. The main features of this
approach is that both \emph{merging} and \emph{splitting} are purely localized
phenomenons. In this paper, we present and motivate the algorithm, and we prove
its correctness in arbitrary dynamic networks. Then we discuss several
implementation choices around this general principle. Preliminary results
regarding its analysis are also discussed, in particular an analytical
expression of the expected merging time for two given trees in a static

transversal emittance driven for instabilities of nonlinear space-charge

to equipartitioning of energy between the degrees of freedom. The
anisotropization phenomena suggest a kind of route to equipartition. In order
to understand the initial dynamical behavior of an anisotropic beam, in

space we have to know how we can compute the variables (volume, area of
surface, and area projected) that characterize the anisotropic beam in phase
space. The purpose of this paper is to propose one definiton of the anisotropic
equipartition \cite{Yankov1}. Anisotropic equipartition corresponds to a phase
space density uniform on the surface invariant of the $\xi$, a version of the
ergodic hypothesis where the $\xi$ invariant play the role of the conserved
energy \cite{Kandrup3}. In the state of anisotropic equipartition, the beam
temperature is stationary, the entropy grows in the cascade form, there is a
coupling of transversal emittance, the beam develops an elliptical shape with a
increase in its size along one direction and there is halo formation along one

modern three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy. Direct tracking of the lung
tumor during radiation therapy is very difficult without implanted fiducial
markers. Indirect tracking relies on the correlation of the tumor's motion and
the surrogate's motion. The present paper presents an analysis of the
correlation between the tumor motion and the diaphragm motion in order to
evaluate the potential use of diaphragm as a surrogate for tumor motion. We
have analyzed the correlation between diaphragm motion and superior-inferior
lung tumor motion in 32 fluoroscopic image sequences from 10 lung cancer
patients. A simple linear model and a more complex linear model that accounts
for phase delays between the two motions have been used. Results show that the
diaphragm is a good surrogate for tumor motion prediction for most patients,
resulting in an average correlation factor of 0.94 and 0.98 with each model
respectively. The model that accounts for delays leads to an average
localization prediction error of 0.8mm and an error at the 95% confidence level
of 2.1mm. However, for one patient studied, the correlation is much weaker
compared to other patients. This indicates that, before using diaphragm for
lung tumor prediction, the correlation should be examined on a
patient-by-patient basis.

redshifts, and we find strong evidence for intrinsic alignment of the galaxy

galaxy images compares well with the intrinsic alignment of galaxy images in a
Lambda-CDM universe, provided we impose Gaussian-random errors on the position
angles of the theoretical galaxies with a dispersion of 25 degrees. Without the
inclusion of these errors, the amplitude of the two-point image correlation
function for the theoretical galaxies is a factor of ~2 higher than it is for
the SDSS galaxies. We interpret this as a combination of modest position angle
errors for the SDSS galaxies, as well as a need for modest misalignment of mass
and light in the theoretical galaxies. The intrinsic alignment of the SDSS
galaxies shows no dependence on the specific star formation rates of the
galaxies and, at most, a very weak dependence on the colors and stellar masses
of the galaxies. At the ~3-sigma level, however, we find an indication that the
images of the most luminous SDSS galaxies are more strongly aligned with each
other than are the images of the least luminous SDSS galaxies.

these computations a superposition of 15 weighted neutron-density components in

the stable heavy element abundance pattern between Ba and U in low-metallicity

constant. Here, hbar is Planck's constant and k_B is Boltzmann's constant. A

Venaticorum scenarios. The results are presented for two different star
formation histories; burst (elliptical-like galaxies) and continuous
(spiral-like galaxies). It is found that delay times for the DDS in our
standard model (with common envelope efficiency alpha = 1) follow a power-law
distribution. For the SDS we note a wide range of delay times, while AM CVn
progenitors produce a short burst of SNe Ia at early times. We point out that
only the rates for two merging carbon-oxygen white dwarfs, the only systems
found in the DDS, are consistent with the observed rates for typical Milky
Way-like spirals. We also note that DDS progenitors are the dominant population
in elliptical galaxies. The fact that the delay time distribution for the DDS
follows a power-law implies more Type Ia supernovae (per unit mass) in young
rather than in aged populations. Our results do not exclude other scenarios,
but strongly indicate that the DDS is the dominant channel generating SNe Ia in
spiral galaxies, at least in the framework of our adopted evolutionary models.
Since it is believed that white dwarf mergers cannot produce a thermonuclear
explosion given the current understanding of accreting white dwarfs, either the
evolutionary calculations along with accretion physics are incorrect, or the
explosion calculations are inaccurate and need to be revisited (Abridged).

temperature phase of {\cal N} =1, 2 and 4 SUSY theory up and including cubic
order. In one loop order no qualitative difference with gluodynamics shows.
However the two loop order shows a logarithmic divergence appear in the centre
of the wall. This is because the gluinos become bosonic in the centre and
acquire long wavelength excitations. We discuss the cure for this divergence,
due to a gluino zero mode. The physics of Casimir scaling is explained. The
cubic order can be obtained from gluodynamics by simple rescalings of the Debye
masses and the Casimir parameter $k/N_c$.

thermal annealing of silicon layers previously amorphized by implantation of
germanium has been proposed. It is supposed that the boron interstitials are
generated continuously during annealing due to dissolution or rearrangement of
the clusters of impurity atoms which are formed in the ion-implanted layers
with impurity concentration above the solubility limit. The local elastic
stresses arising due to the difference of boron atomic radius and atomic radius
of silicon also contribute to the generation of boron interstitials. On the
basis of the model proposed a simulation of redistribution of ion-implanted
boron during rapid thermal annealing with duration of 60 s at a temperature of
850 degrees Celsius has been carried out. The calculated profile of boron
distribution after thermal treatment agrees well with the experimental data
that confirms the adequacy of the model. A number of the parameters of
interstitial diffusion have been derived. In particular, the average migration
length of nonequilibrium boron interstitials is equal to 12 nanometers. It was
also obtained that approximately 1.96 % of boron atoms were converted to the
interstitial sites, participated in the fast interstitial migration, and then
became immobile again transferring into a substitutional position or forming
the electrically inactive complexes with defects of crystal lattice.

galaxies, and find (1) The corotation radius is close to the edge of the CO
data, and is about half of the optical radius for 3 galaxies. (2) The star
formation timescale is roughly consistent with the free-fall time of typical
molecular clouds, which indicates that the gravitational instability is the
dominant mechanism triggering star formation in spiral arms. (3) The timescale
is found to be almost independent of surface density of molecular gas,
metallicity, or spiral arm strengths. The number of ""C"" galaxies and the
quality of CO data, however, are not enough to confirm these relationships. We
also find that 2 other galaxies show no offsets between CO and Ha, although
their arms are clearly traced, and categorize them as ""N"" galaxies. The
presence of a bar could account for this feature, since these 2 galaxies are
both barred. With one galaxy excluded from our analysis due to its poor
rotation curve, offsets of the remaining 5 galaxies are found to be ambiguous.
We categorize them as ""A"" galaxies. The possible reasons for this ambiguity are
(1) the density wave is weaker, and/or (2) observational resolution and
sensitivity are not enough to detect the spiral arms and their offsets clearly.
The former is supported by our finding that the arm strengths of ""A"" galaxies
are slightly weaker than that of ""C"" galaxies. [abridged]

stochastic sensitivities for mean and covariance values of reactant
concentrations and reaction fluxes and show that there exist MCA-like summation
theorems among these sensitivities. The summation theorems for flux variances
are shown to depend on the size of the measurement time window ($\epsilon$),
within which reaction events are counted for measuring a single flux. The
degree of the $\epsilon$-dependency can become significant for processes
involving multi-time-scale dynamics and is estimated by introducing a new
measure of time scale separation. This $\epsilon$-dependency is shown to be
closely related to the power-law scaling observed in flux fluctuations in
various complex networks. We propose a systematic way to control fluctuations
of reactant concentrations while minimizing changes in mean concentration
levels. Such orthogonal control is obtained by introducing a control vector
indicating the strength and direction of parameter perturbations leading to a
sensitive control. We also propose a possible implication in the control of
flux fluctuation: The control distribution for flux fluctuations changes with
the measurement time window size, $\epsilon$. When a control engineer applies a
specific control operation on a reaction system, the system can respond
contrary to what is expected, depending on the time window size $\epsilon$.

from a late-type secondary star in its optical spectrum, which led Schwope et

extensive optical observations of V405 Peg. Time-series spectroscopy shows the
orbital period, Porb, to be 0.1776469(7) d (= 4.2635 hr), or 5.629 cycle/d. We
classify the secondary as M3 - M4.5. Astrometry with the MDM 2.4m telescope
gives a parallax 7.2 +- 1.1 milli-arcsec, and a relative proper motion of 58
mas/yr. Our best estimate of the distance yields d = 149 (+26, -20) pc. The
secondary stars's radial velocity has K2 = 92 +- 3 km/s, indicating a fairly
low orbital inclination if the masses are typical. Extensive I-band time-series
observations in the show the system varying between a minimum brightness level
of I = 14.14 and states of enhanced activity about 0.2 mag brighter. While the
low-state shows an ellipsoidal modulation, an additional photometric modulation
appears in the high state, with 0.1 mag amplitude and period 220-280 min. The
frequency of this modulation appears to be stable for a month or so, but no
single period was consistently detected from one observing season to the next.
We estimate the system luminosity by combining optical measurements with the
archival X-ray spectrum. The implied mass accretion rate is orders of
magnitudes below the predictions for the standard angular momentum loss above
the period gap. The system may possibly belong to a largely undiscovered
population of hibernating CVs.

determined the five orbital parameters for each of them using LSQ fitting to
the locii of the streams. Our results confirm earlier results on the streams in

the stream in the Eastern Arm is also consistent with an elliptical orbit. Both
the Northern and Eastern Arm streams have high eccentricities, while the
Western Arc stream is nearly circular. All three streams orbit around Sgr A* in

and evolution of galaxies. This is a study of the metallicity gradient of the
LMC, SMC and M33 galaxies derived from their asymptotic giant branch (AGB)
stars. The [Fe/H] abundance was derived from the ratio between C- and M-type
AGB stars and its variation analysed as a function of galactocentric distance.
Galaxy structure parameters were adopted from the literature. The metallicity
of the LMC decreases linearly as -0.047+/-0.003 dex/kpc out to ~8 kpc from the
centre. In the SMC, [Fe/H] has a constant value of ~ -1.25+/-0.01 dex up to ~
12 kpc. The gradient of the M33 disc, until ~ 9 kpc, is -0.078+/-0.003 dex/kpc
while an outer disc/halo, out to ~ 25 kpc, has [Fe/H] ~ -1.7 dex. The
metallicity of the LMC, as traced by different populations, bears the signature
of two major star forming episodes: the first one constituting a thick

encounter with the MW and SMC. The [Fe/H] of the recent episode supports an LMC
origin for the Stream. The metallicity of the SMC supports star formation, ~ 3

radial velocity half-amplitudes, K_c, are of order 3 m/s, and the maximum

This makes the LFSR-based encoders of long BCH codes cannot keep up with the

analyzed in the general case of a magnetic multilayer consisting of two or more
metallic ferromagnetic (FM) films separated by normal metal (NM) layers. It is
shown that the spin-pumping-induced dynamic coupling between FM layers modifies
the linearized Gilbert equations in a way that replaces the scalar Gilbert
damping constant with a nonlocal matrix of Cartesian damping tensors. The
latter are shown to be methodically calculable from a matrix algebra solution
of the Valet-Fert transport equations. As an example, explicit analytical
results are obtained for a 5-layer (spin-valve) of form NM/FM/NM'/FM/NM.
Comparisons with earlier well known results of Tserkovnyak et al. for the
related 3-layer FM/NM/FM indicate that the latter inadvertently hid the tensor
character of the damping, and instead singled out the diagonal element of the
local damping tensor along the axis normal to the plane of the two
magnetization vectors. For spin-valve devices of technological interest, the
influence of the tensor components of the damping on thermal noise or
spin-torque critical currents are strongly weighted by the relative magnitude
of the elements of the nonlocal, anisotropic stiffness-field tensor-matrix, and
for in-plane magnetized spin-valves are generally more sensitive to the
in-plane element of the damping tensor.

as much as possible the locality of their distributed computation, while
offering a rich expressive power for networking functionalities. We prove that
they admit tighter upper-bounds with bounded number of messages of bounded

fragments are preserved over locally consistent networks as well as anonymous
networks, thus showing the robustness of the proposed local logical formalisms.

  the semiclassical propagator","8 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.80.031101",,"nlin.CD quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quantized systems whose underlying classical dynamics possess an elaborate
mixture of regular and chaotic motion can exhibit rather subtle long-time
quantum transport phenomena. In a short wavelength regime where semiclassical
theories are most relevant, such transport phenomena, being quintessentially
interference based, are difficult to understand with the system's specific
long-time classical dynamics. Fortunately, semiclassical methods applied to
wave packet propagation can provide a natural approach to understanding the
connections, even though they are known to break down progressively as time
increases. This is due to the fact that some long-time transport properties can
be deduced from intermediate-time behavior. Thus, these methods need only
retain validity and be carried out on much shorter time scales than the
transport phenomena themselves in order to be valuable. The initial value
representation of the semiclassical propagator of Herman and Kluk [M. F. Herman
and E. Kluk, Chem. Phys. 91, 27 (1984)] is heavily used in a number of
molecular and atomic physics contexts, and is of interest here. It is known to
be increasingly challenging to implement as the underlying classical chaos
strengthens, and we ask whether it is possible to implement it well enough to
extract the kind of intermediate time information that reflects wave packet
localization at long times. Using a system of two coupled quartic oscillators,
we focus on the localizing effects of transport barriers formed by stable and
unstable manifolds in the chaotic sea and show that these effects can be
captured with the Herman-Kluk propagator.

semi-numerical scheme to calculate the three-dimensional structure of ionised
regions surrounding massive halos at high redshift. We include the ionising
influence of luminous quasars by populating a simulated overdensity field with
quasars using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain algorithm. We find that quasars modify
both the amplitude and shape of the power spectrum at a level which is of the
same order as the fractional contribution to reionisation. The modification is
found both at constant redshift and at constant global neutral fraction, and
arises because ionising photons produced by quasars are biased relative to the
density field at a level that is higher than steller ionising photons. Our
results imply that quasar ionisation will need to be included in detailed
modelling of observed 21-cm power spectra.

the capacity region of fading broadcast channels with channel state known at

this subject by introducing a layered erasure broadcast channel model in which
each component channel has a state that specifies the received signal levels in
an instance of a deterministic binary expansion channel. We find the capacity
region of this class of broadcast channels. The capacity achieving strategy
assigns each signal level to the user that derives the maximum expected rate
from that level. The outer bound is based on a channel enhancement that creates
a degraded broadcast channel for which the capacity region is known. This same
approach is then used to find inner and outer bounds to the capacity region of
fading Gaussian broadcast channels. The achievability scheme employs a
superposition of binary inputs. For intermittent AWGN channels and for Rayleigh
fading channels, the achievable rates are observed to be with 1-2 bits of the
outer bound at high SNR. We also prove that the achievable rate region is
within 6.386 bits/s/Hz of the capacity region for all fading AWGN broadcast

the particle-hole continuum having the characteristic rotonlike minimum at
short wavelength due to the strong charge-density-wave fluctuations. The energy
of the rotonlike minimum decreases with increasing the lattice velocity and it
reaches zero at the critical velocity which is smaller than the pair breaking
velocity. This indicates that the superfluid state is energetically unstable
due to the spontaneous emission of the short-wavelength rotonlike excitations
of the AB mode instead due to pair-breaking. We determine the critical
velocities as functions of the interaction strength across the BCS-BEC

  Steinacker (eds.)",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are considered as a major constituent
of interstellar dust. They have been proposed as the carriers of the Aromatic
Infrared Bands (AIBs) observed in emission in the mid-IR. They likely have a
significant contribution to various features of the extinction curve such as
the 220 nm bump,the far-UV rise and the diffuse interstellar bands. Emission
bands are also expected in the far-IR, which are better fingerprints of
molecular identity than the AIBs. They will be searched for with the Herschel
Space Observatory. Rotational emission is also expected in the mm range for
those molecules which carry significant dipole moments. Despite spectroscopic
studies in the laboratory, no individual PAH species could be identified. This
emphasises the need for an investigation on where interstellar PAHs come from
and how they evolve due to environmental conditions: ionisation and
dissociation upon UV irradiation, interactions with electrons, gas and dust.
There is also evidence for PAH species to contribute to the depletion of heavy
atoms from the gas phase, in particular Si and Fe. This paper illustrates how
laboratory work can be inspired from observations. In particular there is a
need for understanding the chemical properties of PAHs and PAH-related species,
including very small grains, in physical conditions that mimic those found in
interstellar space. This motivates a joint effort between astrophysicists,
physicists and chemists. Such interdisciplinary studies are currently
performed, taking advantage of the PIRENEA set-up, a cold ion trap dedicated to
astrochemistry.

behavior of the reduced bispectrum of dark matter and compare the results with
the second-order perturbation theory and the halo models for different halo
mass functions. We find that the second-order perturbation theory (PT2) agrees
with the simulations fairly well on large scales of k<0.05 h/Mpc, but it shows
a signature of deviation as the scale goes down. Even on the largest scale
where the bispectrum can be measured reasonably well in our simulations, the
inconsistency between PT2 and the simulations appears for the colinear triangle
shapes. For the halo model, we find that it can only serve as a qualitative
method to help study the behavior of Q on large scales and also on relatively
small scales. The failure of second-order perturbation theory will also affect
the precise determination of the halo models, since they are connected through
the 3-halo term in the halo model. The 2-halo term has too much contribution on
the large scales, which is the main reason for the halo model to overpredict
the bispectrum on the large scales. Since neither of the models can provide a
satisfying description for the bispectrum on scales of about 0.1h/Mpc for the
requirement of precision cosmology, we release the reduced bispectrum of dark
matter on a large range of scales for future analytical modeling of the

the sampling of the stellar initial mass function (SIMF) in the derivation of
the individual masses and the CMF and I establish that such effects are the
largest contributor to the observational uncertainties. An analytical solution,
valid in the limit where uncertainties are small, is provided to establish the
range of cluster masses over which the CMF slope can be obtained with a given
accuracy. The validity of the analytical solution is extended to higher mass
uncertainties using Monte Carlo simulations and the Gamma approximation. The
value of the Poisson mass is calculated for a large range of ages and a variety
of filters for solar-metallicity clusters measured with single-filter
photometry. A method that uses the code CHORIZOS is presented to simultaneously
derive masses, ages, and extinctions. The classical method of using unweighted
UBV photometry to simultaneously establish ages and extinctions of stellar
clusters is found to be unreliable for clusters older than approx. 30 Ma, even
for relatively large cluster masses. On the other hand, augmenting the filter
set to include longer-wavelength filters and using weights for each filter
increases the range of masses and ages that can be accurately measured with
unresolved photometry. Nevertheless, a relatively large range of masses and
ages is found to be dominated by SIMF sampling effects that render the observed
masses useless, even when using UBVRIJHK photometry. A revision of some
literature results affected by these effects is presented and possible

reheating temperature T_R imposed by the dark matter density and by big bang
nucleosynthesis (BBN). For an axino mass compatible with large-scale structure,
m_axino \gtrsim 100 keV, temperatures above 10^9 GeV become viable for f_a >

the dominant decay mode being two-loop suppressed, this lifetime can be
sufficiently large to allow for primordial bound states leading to catalyzed
BBN of Lithium-6 and Beryllium-9. This implies new upper limits on f_a and on
T_R that depend on quantities which will be probed at the Large Hadron

light frequencies remain constant in both interactions. It is also pointed out
that the criterion used by Einstein for the angle of curvature of light rays
passing close to the sun is not their actual trajectory but rather Huygens'
Principle. The latter only requires that the speed of light vary with distance
from a gravitational source in order to produce a measurable effect. As a
result, the observed displacement of star images during solar eclipses can be
explained on the basis of a rotation of the wave front of light without
assuming that individual photons are actually deflected by the sun. A
calculation reported by Schiff in 1960 based on the assumption that light
travels in a straight line for all local observers obtains the same closed
expression for the angle of displacement of star images as in Einstein's
original work, in support of this interpretation. Since light is believed to
follow a straight-line trajectory within any given homogeneous transparent
medium, it is argued that light refraction and gravitational bending have more
in common than is generally realized.

simulations and experiments. Many of these proteins are 'two-state folders',
i.e. proteins that fold rather directly from the denatured state to the native

how to characterize the instable, partially folded conformations of two-state
proteins, in particular the rate-limiting transition-state conformations
between the denatured and the native state. These partially folded
conformations are short-lived and cannot be observed directly in experiments.
However, experimental data from detailed mutational analyses of the folding
dynamics provide indirect access to transition states. The interpretation of
these data, in particular the reconstruction of transition-state conformations,
requires simulation and modeling. The traditional interpretation of the
mutational data aims to reconstruct the degree of structure formation of
individual residues in the transition state, while a novel interpretation aims
at degrees of structure formation of cooperative substructures such as
alpha-helices and beta-hairpins. By splitting up mutation-induced free energy
changes into secondary and tertiary structural components, the novel

Alternatively, this operator arises from the $BC_1$ specialization of the

associate to this operator a self-adjoint operator $H(g)$ on the Hilbert space

purified and characterized. The oxygenase component (ht-PhnI) was shown to
contain one Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] cluster and one mononuclear Fe center per
alpha subunit, based on EPR measurements and iron assay. Steady-state kinetic
measurements revealed that the enzyme had a relatively low apparent Michaelis
constant for naphthalene (Km= 0.92 $\pm$ 0.15 $\mu$M), and an apparent
specificity constant of 2.0 $\pm$ 0.3 $\mu$M-1 s-1. Naphthalene was converted
to the corresponding 1,2-dihydrodiol with stoichiometric oxidation of NADH. On
the other hand, the oxidation of eight other PAHs occurred at slower rates, and
with coupling efficiencies that decreased with the enzyme reaction rate.
Uncoupling was associated with hydrogen peroxide formation, which is
potentially deleterious to cells and might inhibit PAH degradation. In single
turnover reactions, ht-PhnI alone catalyzed PAH hydroxylation at a faster rate
in the presence of organic solvent, suggesting that the transfer of substrate
to the active site is a limiting factor. The four-ring PAHs chrysene and
benz[a]anthracene were subjected to a double ring-dihydroxylation, giving rise
to the formation of a significant proportion of bis-cis-dihydrodiols. In
addition, the dihydroxylation of benz[a]anthracene yielded three dihydrodiols,
the enzyme showing a preference for carbons in positions 1,2 and 10,11. This is

we present U, B, V, I, J, H CMDs of the 256 objects with magnitudes measured in
all bands. While our previous study based on V, I, J and H data allowed us to
trace the star formation history of NGC 1705 back to a Hubble time, the new
data provide a better insight on its recent evolution. With the method of the
synthetic CMDs, we confirm the presence of two strong bursts of star formation
(SF). The older of the two bursts (B1) occurred between ~ 10 and 15 Myr ago,
while the younger burst (B2) started ~ 3 Myr ago, and it is still active. The
stellar mass produced by B2 amounts to ~ 10^6 msun, and it is a factor of ~ 3
lower for B1. The interburst phase was likely characterized by a much lower
level of SF rather than by its complete cessation. The two bursts show distinct
spatial distributions: while B1 is centrally concentrated, B2 is more diffused,
and presents ring and arc-like structures that remind of an expanding shell.
This suggests a feedback mechanism, in which the expanding superbubble observed
in NGC 1705, likely generated by the (10-15) Myr burst, triggered the current
strong SF activity. From the HRC data, we identified 12 star clusters (plus the
SSC) in the central region of NGC 1705, 10 of which have photometry in all the
UBVIJH bands. Using the GALEV models, we derived ages from ~ 10 Myr to ~ 1 Gyr,

case of SU(3) flavor matter with a cubic superpotential viewed as a nontrivial
NAC generalization of the ordinary abelian N=4 SYM and its marginal
deformations. We find that, as in the ordinary commutative case, the NAC N=4
theory is one-loop finite. We provide general arguments in support of all-loop

theorem."" Next, we draw a picture of adversarial forms of noise called
(collectively) ""detrimental noise.""
  Detrimental noise is modeled after familiar properties of noise propagation.
However, it can have various causes. We start by pointing out the difference
between detrimental noise and standard noise models for two qubits and proceed
to a discussion of highly entangled states, the rate of noise, and general
noisy quantum systems.

the left normalizer of the image, and the double centralizer algebra of A
embeds as a topological algebra as the normalizer of the image. We also

(Machholz) were acquired on Nov. 28-29, 2004, and Jan. 19, 2005 (UT dates) with
NIRSPEC at the Keck-2 telescope on Mauna Kea. We detected H2O, CH4, C2H2, C2H6,
CO, H2CO, CH3OH, HCN, and NH3 and we conducted a sensitive search for CH3D. We
report rotational temperatures, production rates, and mixing ratios (with
respect to H2O) at heliocentric distances of 1.49 AU (Nov. 2004) and 1.21 AU
(Jan. 2005). We highlight three principal results: (1) The mixing ratios of
parent volatiles measured at 1.49 AU and 1.21 AU agree within confidence
limits, consistent with homogeneous composition in the mean volatile release
from the nucleus of C/2004 Q2. Notably, the relative abundance of C2H6/C2H2 is
substantially higher than those measured in other comets, while the mixing
ratios C2H6/H2O, CH3OH/H2O, and HCN/H2O are similar to those observed in
comets, referred to as ""organics-normal"". (2) The spin temperature of CH4 is >
35-38 K, an estimate consistent with the more robust spin temperature found for
H2O. (3) We obtained a 3s upper limit of CH3D/CH4 < 0.020 (D/H < 0.005). This
limit suggests that methane released from the nucleus of C/2004 Q2 is not
dominated by a component formed in extremely cold (near 10 K) environments.
Formation pathways of both interstellar and nebular origin consistent with the
measured D/H in methane are discussed. Evaluating the relative contributions of
these pathways requires further modeling of chemistry including both gas-phase
and gas-grain processes in the natal interstellar cloud and in the
protoplanetary disk.

provide an order n execution speed method for the Gaussian elimination step in

gap by excluding the nested portions of the Fermi surface from participating in
