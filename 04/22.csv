millisecond pulsars (MSPs), to the high-energy (>100 MeV) gamma-ray background.
We pay particular attention to the high-latitude part of the background that
could be confused with an extragalactic component in existing analyses that
subtract a Galactic cosmic-ray model. Our pulsar population models are
calibrated to the results of large-scale radio surveys and we employ a simple
empirical gamma-ray luminosity calibration to the spin-down rate that provides
a good fit to existing data. We find that while ordinary pulsars are expected
to contribute only a fraction ~10^-3 of the high-latitude gamma-ray intensity
(I_X~1x10^-5 ph s^-1 cm^-2 sr^-1), MSPs could provide a much larger
contribution and even potentially overproduce it, depending on the model
parameters. We explore these dependences using a range of MSP models as a guide
to how gamma-ray measurements can usefully constrain the MSP population.
Existing gamma-ray background measurements and source counts already rule out
several models. Finally, we show how fluctuations in the gamma-ray sky can be
used to distinguish between different sources of the background.

It has
recently been shown that the Luttinger liquid theory of such a structure maps
to the theory of a weak link in a Luttinger liquid with spin with Luttinger
liquid parameters g_\rho = 1/g_\sigma = g < 1. We show that for 1/2<g<1, the
pinch-off of the point contact as a function of gate voltage is controlled by a
novel quantum critical point, related to a nontrivial intermediate fixed point
found previously in the Luttinger liquid model. We predict that the dependence
of the conductance on gate voltage and temperature near the pinch-off
transition collapses onto a universal curve described by a crossover scaling
function. We compute the conductance, the critical exponents and the scaling
function in solvable limits, which include g=1-\epsilon, g=1/2+\epsilon and
g=1/\sqrt{3}. These results, along with a general scaling analysis provide an
overall picture of the critical behavior as a function of g. In addition, we
analyze the structure of the four terminal conductance of the point contact in
the weak tunneling and weak backscattering limits. We find that different
components of the conductance can have different temperature dependence. We
identify a skew conductance G_{XY}, which we predict vanishes as T^\gamma with
\gamma\ge 2. This behavior is a direct consequence of the unique edge state
structure of the quantum spin Hall insulator. Finally, we show that for g<1/2
the presence of spin non conserving spin orbit interactions leads to a novel
time reversal symmetry breaking insulating phase. In this phase, the transport
is carried by spinless chargons and chargeless spinons. These lead to
nontrivial correlations in the low frequency shot noise. Implications for

populates lower-dimensional vacua very differently from false vacuum eternal
inflation, which occurs entirely within the context of four-dimensions. We

five solar-type stars in two open clusters, in order to study how chromospheric
activity evolves with time. We took UVES high-resolution, high S/N ratio
spectra of 3 stars in IC 4756 and 2 in NGC 5822, which were combined with a

interpretation of our data is that solar-type-star chromospheric activity, from
the age of the Hyades until that of the Sun, does not evolve smoothly. Stars
change from active to inactive on a short timescale. Evolution before and after
such a transition is much less significant than cyclical and long-term
variations. We show that data presented in the literature to support a
correlation between age and activity could be also interpreted differently in
the light of our results.

or foreground sources. Five sources have colors suggestive of deeply embedded
protostars, while 53 sources are detected at Ks only; their spatial
distribution with respect to the extinction suggests they are highly reddened
cluster members. Detectable Ks-band excess is found toward 29 +/- 3 % of the

mass and extinction cuts are applied, and the excess fractions redetermined.
The resulting excesses are then 25 +/- 5 % for RCW 38, and 42 +/- 8 % for

composed of ugriz magnitudes with a three-parameter grid of different composite
stellar population models, computed by adopting solar metallicity and various
IMFs, and we employ the best-fit values of the total projected mass enclosed
within the Einstein ring of each system. We measure size-stellar mass and
surface stellar mass density-stellar mass relations consistent with those
determined for non-lens galaxies. We find statistically significant evidence
that more massive lens galaxies tend to form in regions of higher galaxy
density, as for all early-type galaxies. We measure for the corresponding
stellar quantities the same scaling law between effective mass-to-light ratio
and mass, that is used to explain the ""tilt"" of the FP, and the same evolution
of the effective mass-to-light ratio with redshift, that can be derived from
the FP. We conclude that the lens total mass is linearly proportional to the
luminous mass, at a more than 99% CL. In addition, by assuming that the lens
galaxies are homologous systems, we study their distribution of dark matter and
estimate a value on the order of 30% for the dark over total projected mass
fraction contained within the average Einstein radius of approximately 4 kpc.
These results suggest that early-type lens galaxies are an unbiased subsample
representative of the whole sample of early-type galaxies. This allows us to
generalize our findings on dark matter in lens galaxies to the population of
massive early-type galaxies. We note that, for the assumed metallicity, a
Salpeter IMF describes well the lens sample.

analogy of a quantum system where the violation of the Bell inequality can be
evidenced. In our case, the two qbits entangled state needed to obtain non
classical correlations is encoded using an electromagnetic wave modulated in
amplitude and phase. Computational states are represented in a way where each
one of the two qbits is associated with two orthogonal directions in the input
plane. In addition, unitary operations involved in the measurement of the
observables are simulated with the use of a coherent optical processor. The
images obtained in the output of the process, contain all the information about
the joint, marginal and conditional probabilities. By measuring the intensity
distribution in the image plane we evaluate the mean values of the simulated
observables. The obtained experimental results show, in an illustrative manner,
how some correlations of Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt type exceed the upper bound
imposed by the local realism hypothesis as a consequence of the joint effect of
entanglement and two-particle interference.

generated by autoimmune reactions. The model is based on predator-prey
interactions between a host plants and their pathogens. Such interactions are
often frequency-dependent, so that pathogen attack is focused on the most
abundant plant phenotype, while rare plant types may escape pathogen attack.
Thus, frequency dependence can generate disruptive selection, which can give
rise to speciation if distant phenotypes become reproductively isolated. Based
on recent experimental evidence from {\it Arabidopsis}, we assume that at the
molecular level, incompatibility between strains is caused by epistatic
interactions between two proteins in the plant immune system, the guard and the
guardee. Within each plant strain, immune reactions occur when the guardee
protein is modified by a pathogen effector, and the guard subsequently binds to
the guardee, thus precipitating an immune response. However, when guard and
guardee proteins come from phenotypically distant parents, a hybrid's immune
system can be triggered by erroneous interactions between these proteins even
in the absence of pathogen attack, leading to severe autoimmune reactions in
hybrids. Our model shows how phenotypic variation generated by
frequency-dependent host-pathogen interactions can lead to postzygotic
incompatibility between extremal types, and hence to speciation.

pairings on parabolic geometries. It introduces the concept formally with the

precisely, after introducing the most important notations and definitions, we
first of all give an algebraic description for pairings on homogeneous spaces
and obtain a first existence theorem. Next, a classification of first order
invariant bilinear differential pairings is given under exclusion of certain
degenerate cases that are related to the existence of invariant linear
differential operators. Furthermore, a concrete formula for a large class of
invariant bilinear differential pairings of arbitrary order is given and many
examples are computed. The general theory of higher order invariant bilinear
differential pairings turns out to be much more intricate and a general
construction is only possible under exclusion of finitely many degenerate cases
whose significance in general remains elusive (although a result for projective
geometry is included). The construction relies on so-called splitting operators

situations, discovering interesting rules (results) using traditional frequent

not appropriate. Since without any domain knowledge, setting support threshold
small or large can output nothing or a large number of redundant uninteresting
results. Recently a novel approach of mining only N-most/Top-K interesting
frequent itemsets has been proposed, which discovers the top N interesting
results without specifying any user defined support threshold. However, mining
interesting frequent itemsets without minimum support threshold are more costly
in terms of itemset search space exploration and processing cost. Thereby, the
efficiency of their mining highly depends upon three main factors (1) Database
representation approach used for itemset frequency counting, (2) Projection of
relevant transactions to lower level nodes of search space and (3) Algorithm
implementation technique. Therefore, to improve the efficiency of mining
process, in this paper we present two novel algorithms called (N-MostMiner and
Top-K-Miner) using the bit-vector representation approach which is very
efficient in terms of itemset frequency counting and transactions projection.
In addition to this, several efficient implementation techniques of N-MostMiner

spectroscopic binaries (SBs) from the sample, which have strong X-ray emission
due to tidal spin-up rather than youth. This is equivalent to a 16%
spectroscopic binary fraction, with at most a handful of undiscovered SBs. We
estimate upper limits on the age of the remaining M dwarfs using spectroscopic
youth indicators such as surface gravity-sensitive indices (CaH and K I). We
find that for a sample of field stars with no metallicity measurements, a
single CaH gravity index may not be sufficient, as higher metallicities mimic
lower gravity. This is demonstrated in a sub-sample of metal-rich RV standards,
which appear to have low surface gravity as measured by the CaH index, yet show
no other evidence of youth. We also use additional youth diagnostics such as
lithium absorption and strong H-alpha emission to set more stringent age
limits. Eleven M dwarfs with no H-alpha emission or absorption are likely old
(>400 Myr) and were caught during an X-ray flare. We estimate that our final
sample of the 144 youngest and nearest low-mass objects in the field is less
than 300 Myr old, with 30% of them being younger than 150 Myr and 4 very young

excitation ionization cone centered on the AGN by using the [SiVI] (1.96
micron) line. So far, this structure is the largest reported in the literature
for this coronal line, extending (in projection) as far as ~ 600 pc from the
galaxy nucleus. In a complex spatial distribution, a variety of mechanisms are
driving the gas ionization, including SNe remnant shocks, young stars and AGN
photoionization. The excitation of the molecular gas, however, is mainly
produced by X-rays and SNe remnant shocks. UV-mechanisms like fluorescence
represent a marginal overall contribution to this process, contrary to the
expectations we might have for a galaxy with a recent and strong star
formation. Our SNe rate estimations from [FeII] (1.64 micron) are in excellent
agreement with 6 cm radio emission predictions. Typical SNe rates between

Intermediate Mass Black Holes (IMBHs, with masses in the 100-10000 Msun range)
in the cores of some Globular Clusters (GCs). In this paper we present the
first application of a new technique to determine the presence or absence of a
central IMBH in globular clusters that have reached energy equipartition via
two-body relaxation. The method is based on the measurement of the radial
profile for the average mass of stars in the system, using the fact that a
quenching of mass segregation is expected when an IMBH is present. Here we
measure the radial profile of mass segregation using main-sequence stars for
the globular cluster NGC 2298 from resolved source photometry based on HST-ACS
data. The observations are compared to expectations from direct N-body
simulations of the dynamics of star clusters with and without an IMBH. The mass
segregation profile for NGC 2298 is quantitatively matched to that inferred
from simulations without a central massive object over all the radial range
probed by the observations, that is from the center to about two half-mass
radii. Profiles from simulations containing an IMBH more massive than ~ 300-500
Msun (depending on the assumed total mass of NGC 2298) are instead inconsistent
with the data at about 3 sigma confidence, irrespective of the IMF and binary
fraction chosen for these runs. While providing a null result in the quest of
detecting a central black hole in globular clusters, the data-model comparison
carried out here demonstrates the feasibility of the method which can also be
applied to other globular clusters with resolved photometry in their cores.

hole involving spin-flip give rise to inelastic absorption with one or several
{\it real} excited pairs in the final state, yielding a structure of peaks in
$A(\Omega)$ at multiples of $2\Delta$ above the threshold frequency. The above
conclusions apply to a broad class of systems, e.g., Mott insulators, where a
gap opens at the Fermi level due to the interactions.

lensing shear correlations with unprecedented accuracy. Weak lensing
observables are sensitive to both the distance-redshift relation and the growth
of structure in the Universe. If the cause of accelerated cosmic expansion is
dark energy within general relativity (GR), both cosmic distances and structure
growth are governed by the properties of dark energy. Consequently, one may use
lensing to check for this consistency and test GR. After reviewing the
phenomenology of such tests, we address one major challenge to such a program.
The evolution of the baryonic component of the Universe is highly uncertain and
can influence lensing observables, manifesting as modified structure growth for
a fixed cosmic distance scale. Using two proposed methods, we show that one
could be led to reject the null hypothesis of GR when it is the true theory if
this uncertainty in baryonic processes is neglected. Recent simulations suggest
that we can correct for baryonic effects using a parametrized model in which
the halo mass-concentration relation is modified. The correction renders biases
small compared to statistical uncertainties. We study the ability of future
weak lensing surveys to constrain the internal structures of halos and test the
null hypothesis of GR simultaneously. Compared to nulling information from
small-scales to mitigate sensitivity to baryonic physics, this internal
calibration program should provide limits on deviations from GR that are
several times more constraining. Specifically, we find that limits on general
relativity in the case of internal calibration are degraded by only ~30% or
less compared to the case of perfect knowledge of nonlinear structure.

sin i of 1.65 MJ) and a wide range in orbital eccentricity (0 < e < 0.94). As
planets are thought to form in circumstellar disks, one important question in
planet formation is determining whether, and to what degree, a gaseous disk
affects an eccentric planet's orbit. Recent studies have probed the interaction
between a disk and a terrestrial planet on an eccentric orbit, and the
interaction between a disk and a gas giant on a nearly circular orbit, but
little is known about the interaction between a disk and an eccentric gas
giant. Such a scenario could arise due to scattering while the disk is still
present, or perhaps through planet formation via gravitational instability. We
fill this gap with simulations of eccentric, massive (gap-forming) planets in
disks using the hydrodynamical code FARGO. Although the long-term orbital
evolution of the planet depends on disk properties, including the boundary
conditions used, the disk always acts to damp eccentricity when the planet is
released into the disk. This eccentricity damping takes place on a timescale of
40 years, 15 times faster than the migration timescale.

requiring less memory, by a factor which may become unbounded, depending on the

  K luminosity functions (KLFs) are compared with simulated ones from a model

the IMF, the SFH, and the Pre-MS evolution, and using the average properties of
the observed clusters as boundary conditions
  Twenty-two sources show evidence of clustering from a few up to several tens
of objects, and a median cluster radius of 0.7 pc. A considerable number of
cluster members present an infrared excess characteristic of young
Pre-Main-Sequence objects. We find that the median stellar age ranges between
2.5 10^5 and 5 10^6 years, with evidence of an age spread of the same entity
within each cluster. We also find evidence that older clusters tend to be
smaller in size, in line with the fact that our clusters are on average larger
than those around relatively older Herbig Ae/Be stars. The relationship of the
mass of the most massive star in the cluster with both the clusters richness
and their total stellar mass suggest that our modeled clusters may not be
consistent with them resulting from random sampling of the IMF.

holes residing in luminous quasars discovered in the Large Bright Quasar
Survey, the Bright Quasar Survey, and the Fall Equatorial Stripe of the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The quasars cover a wide range of redshifts (0 <~ z
<= 5) and were subject to different selection criteria and flux density limits.
These samples are thus complementary and can help us gain additional insight on
the true underlying black hole mass distribution, free from selection effects
and mass estimation errors through future studies. We see evidence that the
active z~4 black hole population is somewhat different than that at lower z. In
particular, there is a sharp increase in the space density of the detected
active black holes (M_BH >~ 10^8 Msun) between redshifts ~4 and ~2.5. Also, the
z~4 SDSS quasar mass function has a somewhat flatter high mass-end slope, beta
= -1.75 +- 0.56, compared to the mass functions based on quasars below z of 3,
which display typical slopes of beta =~ -3.3; the latter are consistent with
the mass functions at similar redshifts based on the SDSS Data Release 3 quasar
catalog presented by Vestergaard et al. We see clear evidence of cosmic
downsizing in the comoving space density distribution of active black holes in
the LBQS sample alone. In forthcoming papers, further analysis, comparison, and
discussion of these mass functions will be made with other existing black hole
mass functions, notably that based on the SDSS DR3 quasar catalog. We present
the relationships used to estimate the black hole mass based on the MgII
emission line; the relations are calibrated to the Hbeta and CIV relations by
means of several thousand high quality SDSS spectra. Mass estimates of the
individual black holes of these samples are also presented.

particular subsets of candidate vocabularies, requiring exponential time or

vocabularies, it extracts data regarding regularity patterns in the
subsequences of each vocabulary. In the recognition phase, the algorithm just
uses this data, called subsequence-histogram, to decide in favor of one of the
vocabularies. We provide examples to demonstrate the performance of the
algorithm and show that it can achieve the same performance as MAP in some
situations.

experiments. Prior to the quantitative analysis we investigate in detail the
various features of the neutrino oscillations with NSI, but under the

the characteristic differences between the \epsilon_{e \mu} and

we use a concrete setting with the muon energy of 50 GeV and magnetized iron
detectors at two baselines, one at L=3000 km and the other at L=7000 km, each

undersampled data is a topic of considerable interest; for example, the
literature in the recent field of compressed sensing is already quite immense.
Inspired by recent breakthroughs in the development of novel first-order
methods in convex optimization, most notably Nesterov's smoothing technique,
this paper introduces a fast and accurate algorithm for solving common recovery
problems in signal processing. In the spirit of Nesterov's work, one of the key
ideas of this algorithm is a subtle averaging of sequences of iterates, which
has been shown to improve the convergence properties of standard
gradient-descent algorithms. This paper demonstrates that this approach is
ideally suited for solving large-scale compressed sensing reconstruction
problems as 1) it is computationally efficient, 2) it is accurate and returns
solutions with several correct digits, 3) it is flexible and amenable to many
kinds of reconstruction problems, and 4) it is robust in the sense that its
excellent performance across a wide range of problems does not depend on the
fine tuning of several parameters. Comprehensive numerical experiments on
realistic signals exhibiting a large dynamic range show that this algorithm
compares favorably with recently proposed state-of-the-art methods. We also
apply the algorithm to solve other problems for which there are fewer
alternatives, such as total-variation minimization, and convex programs seeking
to minimize the l1 norm of Wx under constraints, in which W is not diagonal.

relativistically moving radiative flow in the vertical direction. We adopt the
""one-tau photo-oval"" approximation in the comoving frame. Namely, the comoving
observer sees radiation coming from a closed surface where the optical depth
measured from the observer is unity; such a surface is called a one-tau
photo-oval. In general, the radiative intensity emitted by the photo-oval is
non-uniform and anisotropic. Furthermore, the photo-oval surface has a relative
velocity with respect to the comoving observer, and therefore, the observed
intensity suffers from the Doppler effect and aberration. In addition, the
background intensity usually depends on the optical depth. All of these
introduce the anisotropy to the radiation field observed by the comoving
observer. As a result, the relativistic Eddington factor $f$ generally depends
on the optical depth $\tau$, the four velocity $u$, and the velocity gradient
$du/d\tau$. % In the case of a plane-parallel vertical flow, we found that the
relativistic variable Eddington factor $f$ generally decreases as the velocity
gradient increases, but it increases as the velocity increases for some case.
When the comoving radiation field is uniform, it is well approximated by $3f
\sim 1/[ 1+ ({16}/{15})(-{du}/{\gamma d\tau}) +(-{du}/{\gamma d\tau})^{1.6-2}
  ]$. When the radiation field in the inertial frame is uniform, on the other
hand, it is expressed as $f = (1+3\beta^2)/(3+\beta^2$). These relativistic
variable Eddington factors can be used in various relativistic
radiatively-driven flows, such as black-hole accretion flows, relativistic
astrophysical jets and outflows, and relativistic explosions like gamma-ray
bursts.

the T_{xyz}-type octupole is indeed induced in the 4f-orbital of Ce with a

was originally believed that this emission was of thermal nature and primarily
originated from coronal activity (magnetically confined loops, in analogy with
Solar activity) on contracting young stars. Broadband spectral analysis showed
that the emission was not isothermal and that elemental abundances were
non-Solar. The resolving power of the Chandra and XMM X-ray gratings
spectrometers have provided the first, tantalizing details concerning the
physical conditions such as temperatures, densities, and abundances that
characterize the X-ray emitting regions of young star. These existing high
resolution spectrometers, however, simply do not have the effective area to
measure diagnostic lines for a large number of PMS stars over required to
answer global questions such as: how does magnetic activity in PMS stars differ
from that of main sequence stars, how do they evolve, what determines the
population structure and activity in stellar clusters, and how does the
activity influence the evolution of protostellar disks. Highly resolved

of a solid to incident light. We further devise an upfolding scheme to
incorporate optical transitions, that involve high energy orbitals that had
been downfolded in the underlying many-body calculation of the electronic
structure. As an application of the scheme, we present results on a material of

particle size distributions in a 3-d synthetic turbulent flow. We show how a
fractal-like structure, typical of aggregates in natural systems, can be
incorporated in an approximate way into the aggregation and fragmentation model
by introducing effective densities and radii. We apply this model to the
special case of marine aggregates in coastal areas and investigate numerically
the impact of three different modes of fragmentation: large-scale splitting,
where fragments have similar sizes, erosion, where one of the fragments is much
smaller than the other and uniform fragmentation, where all sizes of fragments
occur with the same probability. We find that the steady state particle size
distribution depends strongly on the mode of fragmentation. The resulting size
distribution for large-scale fragmentation is exponential. As some aggregate
distributions found in published measurements share this latter characteristic,
this may indicate that large-scale fragmentation is the primary mode of
fragmentation in these cases.

superaccreting galactic microquasar SS433 at precessional phases of the source
with the maximum disk opening angle is carried out. It is found that the shape
and width of the primary X-ray eclipse is strongly variable suggesting
additional absorption in dense stellar wind and gas outflows from the optical
A7I-component and the wind-wind collision region. The independence of the
observed hard X-ray spectrum on the accretion disk precessional phase suggests
that hard X-ray emission (20-100 keV) is formed in an extended, hot,
quasi-isothermal corona, probably heated by interaction of relativistic jet
with inhomogeneous wind outflow from the precessing supercritical accretion
disk. A joint modeling of X-ray eclipsing and precessional hard X-ray
variability of SS433 revealed by INTEGRAL by a geometrical model suggests the
binary mass ratio $q=m_x/m_v\simeq 0.25\div 0.5$. The absolute minimum of joint
orbital and precessional $\chi^2$ residuals is reached at $q\simeq 0.3$. The
found binary mass ratio range allows us to explain the substantial precessional
variability of the minimum brightness at the middle of the primary optical
eclipse. For the mass function of the optical star $f_v=0.268 M_\odot$ as
derived from Hillwig & Gies data, the obtained value of $q\simeq 0.3$ yields
the masses of the components $m_x\simeq 5.3 M_\odot$, $m_v\simeq 17.7 M_\odot$,
confirming the black hole nature of the compact object in SS433.

dwarf nova GW Librae (GW Lib) during the 2007 superoutburst. Our observation
period covered the rising phase of the superoutburst, maximum, slowly decaying
phase (plateau), and long fading tail after the rapid decline from the plateau.
The spectral features dramatically changed during the observations. In the
rising phase, only absorption lines of H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, and H$\gamma$ were
present. Around the maximum, the spectrum showed singly-peaked emission lines
of H$\alpha$, He I 5876, He I 6678, He II 4686, and C III/N III as well as
absorption lines of Balmer components and He I. These emission lines
significantly weakened in the latter part of the plateau phase. In the fading
tail, all the Balmer lines and He I 6678 were in emission, as observed in
quiescence. We find that the center of the H$\alpha$ emission component was
mostly stable over the whole orbital phase, being consistent with the low
inclination of the system. Comparing with the observational results of WZ Sge
during the 2001 superoutburst, the same type of stars as GW Lib seen with a
high inclination angle, we interpret that the change of the H$\alpha$ profile
before the fading tail phase is attributed to a photoionized region formed at
the outer edge of the accretion disk, irradiated from the white dwarf and inner
disk.

a novel quantum state since there is no order even at zero temperature. For
this case, the deconfined spinons contribute to the thermal Hall response due

ICS HXR emission of Ophiuchus under various scenarios: primary cosmic ray
model, secondary cosmic rays model and neutralino DM annihilation scenario. We
further discuss the predictions of the Warming Ray model for the cluster
atmosphere. Under the assumption to fit the observed HXR emission, we find that
the high-E electrons induce various consequences on the cluster atmosphere: i)
primary electrons can be marginally consistent with the data provided that
their spectrum is cutoff at E~30(90) MeV for spectral index of 3.5 (4.4); ii)
secondary electron models from pp collisions are inconsistent with gamma-ray
limits, cosmic ray protons produce too much heating of the IC gas and their
pressure at the cluster center largely exceeds the thermal one; iii) secondary
electron models from DM annihilation are inconsistent with gamma-ray and radio
limits and electrons produce too much heating of the IC gas at the cluster
center, unless the neutralino annihilation cross section is much lower than the
proposed value. We conclude that ICS by secondary electrons from both
neutralino DM annihilation and pp collisions cannot be the mechanism
responsible for the HXR excess emission; primary electrons are still a
marginally viable solution provided that their spectrum has a low-energy cutoff
at E~30-90 MeV. The WR model offers, so far, the best description of the
cluster in terms of temperature distribution, heating, pressure and spectral
energy distribution. Fermi observations of Ophiuchus will set further

chi^2-template fits and empirical training sets used e.g. in neural nets: chi^2
is more reliable when its probability density functions (PDFs) are inspected
for multiple peaks, while empirical training is more accurate when calibration
and priors of query data and training set match. We present a chi^2-empirical
method that derives PDFs from empirical models as a subclass of kernel
regression methods, and apply it to the SDSS DR5 sample of >75,000 QSOs, which
is full of ambiguities. Objects with single-peak PDFs show <1% outliers, rms
redshift errors <0.05 and vanishing redshift bias. At z>2.5, these figures are
2x better. Outliers result purely from the discrete nature and limited size of
the model, and rms errors are dominated by the instrinsic variety of object
colours. PDFs classed as ambiguous provide accurate probabilities for
alternative solutions and thus weights for using both solutions and avoiding
needless outliers. E.g., the PDFs predict 78.0% of the stronger peaks to be
correct, which is true for 77.9% of them. Redshift incompleteness is common in
faint spectroscopic surveys and turns into a massive undetectable outlier risk
above other performance limitations, but we can quantify residual outlier risks
stemming from size and completeness of the model. We propose a matched
chi^2-error scale for noisy data and show that it produces correct error
estimates and redshift distributions accurate within Poisson errors. Our method
can easily be applied to future large galaxy surveys, which will benefit from
the reliability in ambiguity detection and residual risk quantification.

practice of reverse engineering a software for using its functionality
illegally in the development of another software. Java applications are more
amenable to reverse engineering and re-engineering attacks through methods such
as decompilation because Java class files store the program in a semi complied
form called byte codes. The existing obfuscation systems obfuscate the Java
class files. Obfuscated source code produce obfuscated byte codes and hence two
level obfuscation (source code and byte code level) of the program makes it
more resilient to reverse engineering attacks . But source code obfuscation is
much more difficult due to richer set of programming constructs and the scope
of the different variables used in the program and only very little progress
has been made on this front. We in this paper are proposing a framework named
JConstHide for hiding constants, especially integers in the java source codes,
to defeat reverse engineering through decompilation. To the best of our
knowledge, no data hiding software are available for java source code constant
hiding.

Palomar spectroscopic sample of galaxies. These are found at distances of up to
67 Mpc and cover the absorbed 2-10 keV luminosity range ~10^38-10^43 ergs/s.
Our aim is to determine the distribution of the X-ray absorption in the local
Universe. Three of these are Compton-thick with column densities just above
10^24 cm^-2 and high equivalent width FeKa lines (>700 eV). Five more sources
have low values of the X-ray to [OIII] flux ratio suggesting that they could be
associated with obscured nuclei. Their individual spectra show neither high
absorbing columns nor flat spectral indices. However, their stacked spectrum
reveals an absorbing column density of N_H~10^23 cm^-2. Therefore the fraction
of absorbed sources (>10^22 cm^-2 could be as high as 55+/-12%. A number of
Seyfert-2 appear to host unabsorbed nuclei. These are associated with
low-luminosity sources Lx < 3x10^41 ergs/s. Their stacked spectrum again shows
no absorption while inspection of the \chandra images, where available, shows
that contamination from nearby sources does not affect the {\it XMM-Newton}
spectra in most cases. Nevertheless, such low luminosity sources are not
contributing significantly to the X-ray background flux. When we consider only
the brighter, $>10^{41}$ \lunits, 21 sources, we find that the fraction of
absorbed nuclei rises to $75\pm19 $ % while that of Compton-thick sources to
15-20%. The fraction of Compton-thick AGN is lower than that predicted by the
X-ray background synthesis model in the same luminosity and redshift range.}

DENIS and POSS-II/UKST I band magnitudes show large discrepancies (mean
absolute difference of 0.4 mag), mostly due to different spectral responses of
the two instruments, with an important contribution (0.33 mag rms) from the
large uncertainties in the photometric calibration of the POSS-II and UKST
photographic plates. In the other wavebands, the limiting near infrared
magnitude, morphology and inclination of the galaxies are the most influential
factors which affect the determination of photometry of the galaxies.

Formulas in CL stand for interactive computational problems, seen as games
between a machine and its environment; logical operators represent operations
on such entities; and ""truth"" is understood as existence of an effective
solution. The formalism of CL is open-ended, and may undergo series of
extensions as the studies of the subject advance. So far three -- parallel,

termed toggling. The toggling operations can be characterized as lenient
versions of choice operations where choices are retractable, being allowed to
be reconsidered any finite number of times. This way, they model
trial-and-error style decision steps in interactive computation. The main
technical result of this paper is constructing a sound and complete
axiomatization for the propositional fragment of computability logic whose
vocabulary, together with negation, includes all four -- parallel, toggling,

supergravity and extend the usual phenomenological setting comprising an
observable sector and a hidden supersymmetry breaking sector by including a
third sector leading to the acceleration of the expansion of the universe. We
find that gravitational constraints on the non-existence of a fifth force
naturally imply that the dark energy sector must possess an approximate shift
symmetry. When exact, the shift symmetry provides an example of a dark energy
sector with a runaway potential and a nearly massless dark energy field whose
coupling to matter is very weak, contrary to the usual lore that dark energy
fields must couple strongly to matter and lead to gravitational
inconsistencies. Moreover, the shape of the potential is stable under one-loop
radiative corrections. When the shift symmetry is slightly broken by higher
order terms in the Kahler potential, the coupling to matter remains small.
However, the cosmological dynamics are largely affected by the shift symmetry
breaking operators leading to the appearance of a minimum of the scalar
potential such that dark energy behaves like an effective cosmological constant
from very early on in the history of the universe.

one of the problems which appear in the standard quantum logical formalism,
namely, that for a subsystem of a larger system in an entangled state, the
conjunction of all actual properties of the subsystem does not yield its actual

the von Neumann lattice as a minimal property which determines all other
properties as is the case for pure states or classical systems. The new lattice
also contains all propositions of the von Neumann lattice. We argue that this

single well with three atoms that may lead to quantum phase transition for an
optical lattice of many wells. We discuss the stability of the system to a
phase with non-uniform density.

multi-component curves on surfaces with minimal crossing number less than or

components. To do this, we use the theory of words and phrases which was
introduced by V. Turaev. Indeed we give the homotopy classification of
nanophrases with less than or equal to 4 letters. It is an extension of the
classification of nanophrases of length 2 with less than or equal to 4 letters

(either symmetric or antisymmetric) representation formulated on a manifold
with at least one compact dimension with non-trivial holonomy the discrete
symmetries $C$, $P$ and $T$ are broken at small enough size of the compact
direction(s) for certain values of $N$. We show that for those $N$ in the
broken phase a non-zero baryon current wrapping in the compact direction
exists, which provides a measurable observable for the breaking of $C$, $P$ and
$T$. We prove that in all cases where the current is absent there is no
breaking of those discrete symmetries. This includes the limit $N \to \infty$
of the SU($N$) gauge theory with symmetric or antisymmetric fermions and U($N$)
gauge theory at any value of $N$. We then argue that the component of the
baryon current in the compact direction is the physical order parameter for
$C$, $P$ and $T$ breaking due to the breaking of Lorentz invariance.

techniques and methods of analysis. We have generally found that the values for
the exponents alpha, beta, gamma and delta depart significantly from the
predictions for the 3D Heisenberg model and are intermediate between these
expectations and the values characterizing a typical spin glass transition.
Comparing the exponents obtained in our work with indices for other re-entrant
systems reported in the literature, a weak universality class may be defined
where the exponents distribute within a certain range around average values.

  We find that the purely universal and purely existential fragments of the
theory of normed spaces are decidable, as is the AE fragment of the theory of
metric spaces. These results are sharp of their type: reductions of Hilbert's

requires knowledge of the infinite set of multi-point Green's functions, unless
one can find some way of truncating the corresponding Schwinger-Dyson
equations. For the fermion and boson propagators in QED this requires an {\it
ansatz} for the full three point vertex. Here we illustrate how the properties
of gauge invariance, gauge covariance and multiplicative renormalizability
impose severe constraints on this fermion-boson interaction, allowing a
consistent truncation of the propagator equations. We demonstrate how these
conditions imply that the 3-point vertex {\bf in the propagator equations} is
largely determined by the behaviour of the fermion propagator itself and not by
knowledge of the many higher point functions. We give an explicit form for the
fermion-photon vertex, which in the fermion and photon propagator fulfills
these constraints to all orders in leading logarithms for massless QED, and
accords with the weak coupling limit in perturbation theory at ${\cal
O}(\alpha)$. This provides the first attempt to deduce non-perturbative Feynman
rules for strong physics calculations of propagators in massless QED that
ensures a more consistent truncation of the 2-point Schwinger-Dyson equations.
The generalisation to next-to-leading order and masses will be described in a
longer publication.
