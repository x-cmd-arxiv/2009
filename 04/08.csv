""short-hard"" gamma-ray bursts (SHBs) are associated with compact binary
inspiral. Since gravitational-wave (GW) measurements of well-localized
inspiraling binaries can measure absolute source distances, simultaneous
observation of a binary's GWs and SHB would allow us to independently determine
both its luminosity distance and redshift. Such a ""standard siren"" (the GW
analog of a standard candle) would provide an excellent probe of the relatively
nearby universe's expansion, complementing other standard candles. In this
paper, we examine binary measurement using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique
to build the probability distributions describing measured parameters. We
assume that each SHB observation gives both sky position and the time of
coalescence, and we take both binary neutron stars and black hole-neutron star
coalescences as plausible SHB progenitors. We examine how well parameters
particularly distance) can be measured from GW observations of SHBs by a range
of ground-based detector networks. We find that earlier estimates overstate how
well distances can be measured, even at fairly large signal-to-noise ratio. The
fundamental limitation to determining distance proves to be a degeneracy
between distance and source inclination. Overcoming this limitation requires
that we either break this degeneracy, or measure enough sources to broadly
sample the inclination distribution. (Abridged)

employ fractional derivatives in place of the usual integer order derivatives.
They govern scaling limits of random walk models, with power law jumps leading
to fractional derivatives in space, and power law waiting times between the
jumps leading to fractional derivatives in time. The limit process is a stable
L\'evy motion that models the jumps, subordinated to an inverse stable process
that models the waiting times. Using duality, we relate the density of a
spectrally negative stable process with index $1<\alpha<2$ to the density of
the hitting time of a stable subordinator with index $1/\alpha$, and thereby
unify some recent results in the literature. These results also provide a
concrete interpretation of Zolotarev duality in terms of the fractional

thus finding the correct spin-orbit coupling structure is an important step
towards advanced spintronic applications. We show theoretically that the
curvature in a carbon nanotube generates two types of the spin-orbit coupling,
one of which was not recognized before. In addition to the topological
phase-related contribution of the spin-orbit coupling, which appears in the
off-diagonal part of the effective Dirac Hamiltonian of carbon nanotubes, there
is another contribution that appears in the diagonal part. The existence of the
diagonal term can modify spin-orbit coupling effects qualitatively, an example
of which is the electron-hole asymmetric spin splitting observed recently, and
generate four qualitatively different behavior of energy level dependence on
parallel magnetic field. It is demonstrated that the diagonal term applies to a
curved graphene as well. This result should be valuable for spintronic
applications of graphitic materials.

conclusion on the existence of a resonance mechanism allowing weak magnetic
fields to affect biological processes. These fields may either be static
magnetic fields comparable in magnitude with the magnetic field of the earth or
weak ultra-low frequency time-dependent fields. So far, a generally accepted
theoretical model allowing one to understand the effect of magnetic and
electric fields on biological processes is not available. By this reason, it is
not clear which characteristics of the fields, like magnetic and electric field
strength, frequency of change of the field, shape of the electromagnetic wave,
the duration of the magnetic or electric influence or some particular
combination of them, are responsible for the biological effect. In the present
analysis it is shown that external time-independent magnetic fields may cause a
resonance amplification of ionic electric currents in biological tissues and,
in particular, in the vasculature system due to a Brownian motion of charges.
These resonance electric currents may cause necrotic changes in the tissues or
blood circulation and in this way significantly affect the biological organism.
The magnitude of the magnetic fields leading to resonance effects is estimated,

red-sequence. Motivated by recent findings with GALEX that a large fraction of
ETGs exhibit UV-excess as a sign of RSF, we investigate the possible connection
of the UV-excess galaxies to E+As. In particular, we examine the FP scaling
relations of the largest sample of ~1,000 E+As selected from the SDSS and
~20,000 morphologically-selected SDSS ETGs with GALEX UV data. The FP
parameters, combined with stellar population indicators, reveal a certain group
of UV-excess ETGs that bridges between E+As and quiescent red galaxies. The
newly identified galaxies are the post-starburst systems characterized by
UV-excess but no Ha emission. This is a conceptual generalisation of ""E+A"", in
that the Balmer absorption line in the ""E+A"" definition is replaced with
UV-optical colours that are far more sensitive to RSF than the Balmer lines. We
refer to these UV-excess galaxies as ""E+a"" galaxies, which stands for
elliptical (""E"") galaxies with a minority of A-type (""a"") young stars. The
species are either (1) galaxies that experienced starbursts weaker than those
observed in E+As (1~10% of E+As, ""mild E+As"") or (2) the products of passively
evolved E+As after quenching star formation quite a while ago (~1 Gyr, ""old

factorization in frustration free quantum spin models defined on lattices in
any spatial dimension and for interactions of arbitrary range. We show that,
quite generally, non exactly solvable translationally invariant models in
presence of an external uniform magnetic field can admit exact, fully

conditions between the applied field and the interaction strengths. These

fundamental observables such as energy and magnetization. The method is applied
to a series of examples of increasing complexity, including
translationally-invariant models with short, long, and infinite ranges of

homogeneous method stellar atmospheric parameters and abundances for iron,
silicium and nickel in 63 Post T-Tauri Stars from 11 nearby young associations.
We further compare the results with two different pre-main sequence (PMS) and
main sequence (MS) star populations. The stellar atmospheric parameters and the
abundances presented here were derived using the equivalent width of individual
lines in the stellar spectra through the excitation/ionization equilibrium of
iron. Moreover, we compared the observed Balmer lines with synthetic profiles
calculated for model atmospheres with a different line formation code. We found
that the synthetic profiles agree reasonably well with the observed profiles,
although the Balmer lines of many stars are substantially filled-in, probably
by chromospheric emission. Solar metallicity is found to be a common trend on
all the nearby young associations studied. The low abundance dispersion within
each association strengthens the idea that the origin of these nearby young
associations is related to the nearby Star Forming regions (SFR). Abundances of
elements other than iron are consistent with previous results on Main Sequence
stars in the solar neighborhood. The chemical characterization of the members
of the newly found nearby young associations, performed in this study and
intended to proceed in subsequent works, is essential for understanding and

We have recently proposed to interpret these observations as evidence for a
novel ``striped superconducting'' state, in which the superconducting order
parameter is modulated in space, such that its average is precisely zero. Here,
we show that thermal melting of the striped superconducting state can lead to a
number of unusual phases, of which the most novel is a charge $4e$
superconducting state, with a corresponding fractional flux quantum $hc/4e$.
These are never-before observed states of matter, and ones, moreover, that
cannot arise from the conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) mechanism.
Thus, direct confirmation of their existence, even in a small subset of the
cuprates, could have much broader implications for our understanding of high
temperature superconductivity. We propose experiments to observe fractional
flux quantization, which thereby could confirm the existence of these states.

higher concentration and smaller physical size. DOGs with high concentration
also tend to have spectral energy distributions (SEDs) suggestive of AGN

approach for examining phase transitions in model Hamiltonians, and, in

treat strongly correlated materials. The key advantage to the technique is
that, unlike competing real space methods, the sign problem is well controlled
in the Hirsch-Fye (HF) quantum Monte Carlo used as an exact cluster solver.
However, an important computational bottleneck remains; the HF method scales as
the cube of the inverse temperature, $\beta$. This often makes simulations at
low temperatures extremely challenging. We present here a new method based on
determinant quantum Monte Carlo which scales linearly in $\beta$, and

calculated following the general scheme of Ilgner and Nelson but with an
updated UMIST database of chemical reactions and some improvements in the grain
physics, and for the minimum-mass solar nebula rather than an alpha disk. The
new limits on grain abundance are slightly more severe than theirs. Even for
optimally sized grains, the layer should be at least marginally optically thin
to its own thermal radiation, so that narrow, highly saturated emission lines
of water and other molecular species would be expected if accretion is driven
by turbulence and standard rates of ionization prevail. If the grain size
distribution extends broadly from well below a micron to a millimeter or more,
as suggested by observations, then the layer may be so optically thin that its
cooling is dominated by molecular emission. Even under such conditions, it is
difficult to have active layers of more than 10g/cm^2 near 1AU unless dust is
entirely eliminated or greatly enhanced ionization rates are assumed.
Equipartition-strength magnetic fields are then required in these regions of
the disk if observed accretion rates are driven by magnetorotational
turbulence. Wind-driven accretion might allow weaker fields and less massive
active layers but would not heat the layer as much as turbulence and therefore
might not produce emission lines.

more text processing applications separate a single big text file into multiple

model is multiple sequences sets (MSS). Though there is increasing use of MSS,
there is little research on how to process MSS efficiently. To process multiple
sequences sets, sequences are first distributed to different sets, and then
sequences for each set are processed. Deriving effective algorithm for MSS
processing is both interesting and challenging. In this paper, we have defined
the cost functions and performance ratio for analysis of the quality of
synthesis sequences. Based on these, the problem of Process of Multiple
Sequences Sets (PMSS) is formulated. We have first proposed two greedy
algorithms for the PMSS problem, which are based on generalization of
algorithms for single sequences set. Then based on the analysis of the
characteristics of multiple sequences sets, we have proposed the Distribution

algorithm, the sequences are first distributed to multiple sets according to
their alphabet contents; then sequences in each set are deposited by the
deposition algorithm. The DDA* algorithm differs from the DDA algorithm in that
the DDA* algorithm distributes sequences by clustering based on sequence
profiles. Experiments show that DDA and DDA* always output results with smaller
costs than other algorithms, and DDA* outperforms DDA in most instances. The
DDA and DDA* algorithms are also efficient both in time and space.

elemental C is deposited on or segregates to the Ru(0001) surface. Nonlinearity
of the graphene growth rate with C adatom density suggests that growth proceeds
by addition of C atom clusters to the graphene edge. The generality of this
picture has now been studied by use of low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM) to
observe graphene formation when Ru(0001) and Ir(111) surfaces are exposed to
ethylene. The finding that graphene growth velocities and nucleation rates on
Ru have precisely the same dependence on adatom concentration as for elemental
C deposition implies that hydrocarbon decomposition only affects graphene
growth through the rate of adatom formation; for ethylene, that rate decreases
with increasing adatom concentration and graphene coverage. Initially, graphene
growth on Ir(111) is like that on Ru: the growth velocity is the same nonlinear
function of adatom concentration (albeit with much smaller equilibrium adatom
concentrations, as we explain with DFT calculations of adatom formation
energies). In the later stages of growth, graphene crystals that are rotated
relative to the initial nuclei nucleate and grow. The rotated nuclei grow much
faster. This difference suggests first, that the edge-orientation of the
graphene sheets relative to the substrate plays an important role in the growth
mechanism, and second, that attachment of the clusters to the graphene is the
slowest step in cluster addition, rather than formation of clusters on the
terraces.

this considering and inspired by the interchange symmetry between the Ricci
flat black hole and the AdS soliton solution which arises from the double
analytic continuation of the time and compact spatial direction, we find out
the analogy of the energy and tension laws of the AdS soliton solution.
Moreover, we also investigate the energy and tension laws of the boosted Ricci
flat black hole, and discuss the boosted AdS soliton solution. However,
although there is the same interchange symmetry between the boosted Ricci flat
black hole and boosted AdS soliton, the analogy of laws of the boosted AdS
soliton solution may be of no sense for the existence of the closed timelike
curves and conical singularity. In spite of that, the conserved charges such as
the energy and momentum of the boosted AdS soliton are well-defined, and an
interesting result is that its energy is lower than that of the static AdS
soliton. On the other hand, note that although the laws obtained above are the
same as those of the asymptotically flat case, the underlying deduced contents
are different. Thus, our results could also be considered as a simple
generalization to the asymptotically AdS case. Moreover, during the
calculation, we find that there may be a new way to define the gravitational
tension which can come from the quasi-local stress tensor of the counter-term
method.

  Auction mechanism design aims to manipulate the rules of an auction in order

called pseudospin that describes their location in the crystal lattice. An
emerging direction in quantum materials research is the manipulation of atomic
spin-orbit coupling to simulate the effect of a spin dependent magnetic

exhibit a single helical Dirac cone that is fully spin-polarized. Our
observations of a gap in the bulk spin-degenerate band and a spin-resolved
surface Dirac node close to the chemical potential show that the low energy
dynamics of Bi2Te3 is dominated by the unpaired spin-helical Dirac modes. Our
spin-texture measurements prove the existence of a rare topological phase in
this materials class for the first time, and suggest its suitability for novel
2D Dirac spin device applications beyond the chiral variety or traditional
graphene.

algorithms for any biometric authentication systems. Conventional matching
algorithms are not necessarily secure against strong intentional impersonation
attacks such as wolf attacks. The wolf attack is an attempt to impersonate a
genuine user by presenting a ""wolf"" to a biometric authentication system
without the knowledge of a genuine user's biometric sample. A wolf is a sample
which can be accepted as a match with multiple templates. The wolf attack
probability (WAP) is the maximum success probability of the wolf attack, which
was proposed by Une, Otsuka, Imai as a measure for evaluating security of
biometric authentication systems. We present a principle for construction of
secure matching algorithms against the wolf attack for any biometric
authentication systems. The ideal matching algorithm determines a threshold for
each input value depending on the entropy of the probability distribution of
the (Hamming) distances. Then we show that if the information about the
probability distribution for each input value is perfectly given, then our
matching algorithm is secure against the wolf attack. Our generalized matching
algorithm gives a theoretical framework to construct secure matching
algorithms. How lower WAP is achievable depends on how accurately the entropy
is estimated. Then there is a trade-off between the efficiency and the
achievable WAP. Almost every conventional matching algorithm employs a fixed
threshold and hence it can be regarded as an efficient but insecure instance of
our theoretical framework. Daugman's IrisCode recognition algorithm proposed
can also be regarded as a non-optimal instance of our framework.

there is an innate preference of the speakers towards acquiring certain

non-barred galaxies. Either black holes in barred galaxies tend to be anaemic
or the central velocity dispersions in these galaxies have a tendency to be
elevated by the presence of the bar. The latter option is in accord with
studies connecting larger velocity dispersions in galaxies with old bars, while
the former scenario is at odds with the observation that barred galaxies do not
deviate from the M_bh-luminosity relation. Using a sample of 88 galaxies with
active galactic nuclei, whose supermassive black hole masses have been
estimated from their associated emission lines, we reveal for the first time

Carlo techniques, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and particle filters,
have become very popular in signal processing over the last years. However, in
many problems of practical interest these techniques demand procedures for
sampling from probability distributions with non-standard forms, hence we are
often brought back to the consideration of fundamental simulation algorithms,
such as rejection sampling (RS). Unfortunately, the use of RS techniques
demands the calculation of tight upper bounds for the ratio of the target
probability density function (pdf) over the proposal density from which
candidate samples are drawn. Except for the class of log-concave target pdf's,
for which an efficient algorithm exists, there are no general methods to
analytically determine this bound, which has to be derived from scratch for
each specific case. In this paper, we introduce new schemes for (a) obtaining
upper bounds for likelihood functions and (b) adaptively computing proposal
densities that approximate the target pdf closely. The former class of methods
provides the tools to easily sample from a posteriori probability distributions
(that appear very often in signal processing problems) by drawing candidates
from the prior distribution. However, they are even more useful when they are
exploited to derive the generalized adaptive RS (GARS) algorithm introduced in
the second part of the paper. The proposed GARS method yields a sequence of
proposal densities that converge towards the target pdf and enable a very
efficient sampling of a broad class of probability distributions, possibly with
multiple modes and non-standard forms.

and formal groups of height one over such fields that do not arise from
elliptic curves. It also implies that the Hasse invariant does not obey the
Hasse principle.
  Moreover, we also analyse twisted forms of $p$-torsion subgroup schemes of
ordinary elliptic curves and the analogous questions for supersingular curves.

morphological instabilities resulting in the spontaneous formation of ripple
structures in nanometer length scales. In the case of Si surfaces at ambient
temperature, ripple formation is found to take place normally at lower incident
angles with the wave vector parallel to the ion beam direction. The absence of
ripple pattern on Si surface at larger angles is due to the dominance of ion
beam polishing effect. We have shown that a gentle chemical roughening of the
starting surface morphology can initiate ripple pattern under grazing incidence
ion beam sputtering, where the ripple wave vector is perpendicular to the ion
beam direction. The characteristics of the perpendicular mode ripples are
studied as a function of pristine surface roughness and ion fluence. The
quality of the morphological structure is assessed from the analysis of ion

presented. Intrinsic sparsity of distribution of clutter and target energy on
spatial-frequency plane was exploited from the viewpoint of compressed sensing.
The original sample data and distribution of target and clutter energy was
connected by a ill-posed linear algebraic equation and popular $L_1$
optimization method could be utilized to search for its solution with sparse
characteristic. Several new filtering algorithm acting on this solution were
designed to clean clutter component on spatial-frequency plane effectively for
detecting invisible targets buried in clutter. The method above is called
CS-STAP in general. CS-STAP showed their advantage compared with conventional
STAP technique, such as SMI, in two ways: Firstly, the resolution of CS-STAP on
estimation for distribution of clutter and target energy is ultra-high such
that clutter energy might be annihilated almost completely by carefully tuned
filter. Output SCR of CS-STAP algorithms is far superior to the requirement of
detection; Secondly, a much smaller size of training sample support compared
with SMI method is requested for CS-STAP method. Even with only one snapshot
(from target range cell) could CS-STAP method be able to reveal the existence
of target clearly. CS-STAP method display its great potential to be used in
heterogeneous situation. Experimental result on dataset from mountaintop
program has provided the evidence for our assertion on CS-STAP.

$<0.1$ mag). After field decontamination, the colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs)
display similar morphologies: a poorly-populated main sequence (MS) and a
dominant fraction of pre-MS (PMS) stars somewhat affected by differential
reddening. Pismis 5, vdB 80 and BDSB 96 have MS ages within $5\pm4$ Myr, while
the MS of NGC 1931 is $10\pm3$ Myr old. However, non-instantaneous star
formation is implied by the wider ($\sim20$ Myr) PMS age spread. The cluster
masses derived from MS + PMS stars are low, within $\sim60-180 \ms$, with mass
functions (MFs) significantly flatter than Salpeter's initial mass function
(IMF). Distances from the Sun are within $1.0-2.4$ kpc, and the visual
absorptions are in the range $\aV=1.0-2.0$. From the stellar radial density
profiles (RDPs), we find that they are small ($\rc\la0.48$ pc, $\rl\la5.8$ pc),
especially Pismis 5 with $\rc\approx0.2$ pc and $\rl\approx1.8$ pc. Except for
the irregular and cuspy inner regions of NGC 1931 and Pismis 5, the stellar
RDPs follow a King-like profile. At $\sim10$ Myr, central cusps - which in old
clusters appear to be related to advanced dynamical evolution - are probably
associated with a star-formation and/or molecular cloud fragmentation effect.
Despite the flat MFs, vdB 80 and BDSB 96 appear to be typical young, low-mass
OCs. NGC 1931 and especially Pismis 5, with irregular RDPs, low cluster mass
and flat MFs, do not appear to be in dynamical equilibrium. Both may be
evolving into OB associations and/or doomed to dissolution in a few $10^7$ yr.

particle spectra are peaked at energies that can be modeled by a modified BCS
dispersion. However, even at very low temperatures their width is comparable to
their energy, except for a small region around the dispersion minimum. The
structure of the excitation spectrum of the unitary gas at infinite scattering
length agrees with recent momentum-resolved rf spectra near the critical
temperature. A detailed comparison is made with momentum integrated, locally
resolved rf spectra of the unitary gas at arbitrary temperatures and shows very
good agreement between theory and experiment. The pair size defined from the

of B and B_s decays, we consider the Standard Model with a 4th sequential
family (SM4) which seems to offer a rather simple resolution. We initially
assume T-invariance by taking the up and down-quark 4x4 mass matrix to be real.
Following Friedberg and Lee (FL), we then impose a ""hidden"" symmetry on the
unobserved (""hidden"") up and down-quark SU(2) states. The hidden symmetry for
four generations ensures the existence of two zero-mass eigenstates, which we
take to be the (u,c) and (d,s) states in the up and down-quark sectors,
respectively. Then, we simultaneously break T-invariance and the hidden
symmetry by introducing two phase factors in each sector. This breaking
mechanism generates the small quark masses m_u, m_c and m_d, m_s which, along
with the orientation of the hidden symmetry, determine the size of CP-violation
in the SM4. For illustration we choose a specific physical picture for the
hidden symmetry and the breaking mechanism that reproduces the observed quark
masses, mixing angles and CP-violation, and at the same time allows us to
further obtain very interesting relations/predictions for the mixing angles of
t and t'. For example, with this choice we get V_{td} ~ (V_{cb}/V_{cd} -
V_{ts}/V_{us}) + O(\lambda^2) and V_{t'b} ~ V_{t'd}x(V_{cb}/V_{cd}), V_{tb'} ~
V_{t'd}x(V_{ts}/V_{us}), implying that V_{t'd} > V_{t'b},V_{tb'}. We
furthermore find that the Cabibbo angle is related to the orientation of the
hidden symmetry and that the key CP-violating quantity of our model at
high-energies, J_{SM4} = Im[V_{tb} V_{t'b}^* V_{t'b'} V_{tb'}^*], which is the
high-energy analogue of the Jarlskog invariant of the SM, is proportional to
the light-quark masses and the measured CKM angles.

the preimages of a non-degenerate annulus in the puzzle. However, in some
important new applications of the puzzle (notably, matings of quadratic

generate probabilistic, uncertain data has resulted in a need for efficiently
supporting complex querying and decision-making over such data. In this paper,
we present a unified approach to ranking and top-k query processing in
probabilistic databases by viewing it as a multi-criteria optimization problem,
and by deriving a set of features that capture the key properties of a
probabilistic dataset that dictate the ranked result. We contend that a single,
specific ranking function may not suffice for probabilistic databases, and we
instead propose two parameterized ranking functions, called PRF-w and PRF-e,
that generalize or can approximate many of the previously proposed ranking
functions. We present novel generating functions-based algorithms for
efficiently ranking large datasets according to these ranking functions, even
if the datasets exhibit complex correlations modeled using probabilistic
and/xor trees or Markov networks. We further propose that the parameters of the
ranking function be learned from user preferences, and we develop an approach
to learn those parameters. Finally, we present a comprehensive experimental
study that illustrates the effectiveness of our parameterized ranking
functions, especially PRF-e, at approximating other ranking functions and the
scalability of our proposed algorithms for exact or approximate ranking.

particular high frequency peaked sources (HBLs), displays irregular activity
not yet understood. In this work we report a methodology capable of
characterizing the time behavior of these variable objects. The Maximum
Likelihood Blocks (MLBs) is a model-independent estimator which sub-divides the
light curve into time blocks, whose length and amplitude are compatible with
states of constant emission rate of the observed source. The MLBs yields the
statistical significance in the rate variations and strongly suppresses the
noise fluctuations in the light curves. We apply the MLBs for the first time on
the long term X-ray light curves (RXTE/ASM) of Mkn~421,Mkn~501, 1ES 1959+650
and 1ES 2155-304, which consist of more than 10 years of observational data
(1996-2007). Using the MLBs interpretation of RXTE/ASM data, the integrated
time flux distribution is determined for each single source considered. We
identify in these distributions the characteristic level as well as the flaring
states of the blazars. All the distributions show a significant component at
negative flux values, most probably caused by an uncertainty in the background
subtraction and by intrinsic fluctuations of RXTE/ASM. This effect interests in
particular short time observations. In order to quantify the probability that
the intrinsic fluctuations give rise to a false identification of a flare, we
study a population of very faint sources and their integrated time flux
distribution. We determine duty cycle or fraction of time a source spent in the
flaring state of the source Mkn~421, Mkn~501, 1ES 1959+650 and 1ES 2155-304.
Moreover, we study the random coincidences between flares and generic sporadic
events such as high energy neutrinos or flares in other wavelengths.

~0.5 to 2 keV. The morphology of the coolest X-ray emitting gas at 0.5 keV
temperature is similar to the Halpha emitting nebula known in this cluster,
