$q^{d(\pi,e)}/P_n(q)$, where $d(\pi,e)$ is the distance between $\pi$ and the
identity element, relative to the Coxeter generators. Equivalently, it is the
number of inversions: pairs $(i,j)$ where $1\leq i<j\leq n$, but $\pi_i>\pi_j$.
Analyzing the normalization $P_n(q)$, Diaconis and Ram calculated the mean and

(NEMS) exemplified by a gigahertz oscillator are studied. Various factors that
influence the tribological properties of the nanotube-based NEMS are
quantitatively analyzed with the use of molecular dynamics calculations of the
quality factor (Q-factor) of the gigahertz oscillator. We demonstrate that
commensurability of the nanotube walls can increase the dissipation rate, while
the structure of the wall ends and the nanotube length do not influence the
Q-factor. It is shown that the dissipation rate depends on the interwall
distance and the way of fixation of the outer wall and is significant in the
case of a poor fixation for the nanotubes with a large interwall distance.
Defects are found to strongly decrease the Q-factor due to the excitation of
low-frequency vibrational modes. No universal correlation between the static
friction forces and the energy dissipation rate is established. We propose an
explanation of the obtained results on the basis of the classical theory of
vibrational-translational relaxation. Significant thermodynamics fluctuations
are revealed in the gigahertz oscillator by molecular dynamics simulations and
analyzed in the framework of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Possibility
of designing the NEMS with a desirable Q-factor and their applications are
discussed on the basis of the above results.

sharp edge is confined by a satellite's m^th Lindblad resonance (LR). This
model uses a streamline formalism to calculate the ring's internal forces,
namely, ring gravity, pressure, viscosity, as well as a hypothetical drag
force. The model calculates the streamlines' forced orbit elements and surface
density throughout the perturbed ring. The model is then applied to the outer
edge of Saturn's B ring, which is maintained by an m=2 inner LR with the
satellite Mimas. Ring models are used to illustrate how a ring's perturbed
state depends on the ring's physical properties: surface density, viscosity,
dispersion velocity, and the hypothetical drag force. A comparison of models to
the observed outer B ring suggests that the ring's surface density there is
between 10 and 280 gm/cm^2. The ring's edge also indicates where the viscous
torque counterbalances the perturbing satellite's gravitational torque on the
ring. But an examination of seemingly conventional viscous B ring models shows
that they all fail to balance these torques at the ring's edge. This is due
ring self-gravity and the fact that a viscous ring tends to be nearly
peri-aligned with the satellite, which reduces the satellite's torque on the
ring and makes the ring's edge more difficult to maintain. Nonetheless, the
following shows that a torque balance can still be achieved in a viscous B
ring, but only in an extreme case where the ratio of the ring's bulk/shear
viscosities satisfy ~10^4. However, if the dissipation of the ring's forced
motions is instead dominated by a weak drag force, then the satellite can exert
a much stronger torque that can counterbalance the ring's viscous torque.

The coupling of two MCs could be considered as the comprehensive interaction
between two systems, each comprising of an MC body and its driven shock. The
MC2-driven shock and MC2 body are successively involved into interaction with
MC1 body. The momentum is transferred from MC2 to MC1. After the passage of
MC2-driven shock front, magnetic field lines in MC1 medium previously
compressed by MC2-driven shock are prevented from being restored by the MC2
body pushing. MC1 body undergoes the most violent compression from the ambient
solar wind ahead, continuous penetration of MC2-driven shock through MC1 body,
and persistent pushing of MC2 body at MC1 tail boundary. As the evolution
proceeds, the MC1 body suffers from larger and larger compression, and its
original vulnerable magnetic elasticity becomes stiffer and stiffer. So there
exists a maximum compressibility of Multi-MC when the accumulated elasticity
can balance the external compression. With respect to Multi-MC
geoeffectiveness, the evolution stage is a dominant factor, whereas the
collision intensity is a subordinate one. The magnetic elasticity, magnetic
helicity of each MC, and compression between each other are the key physical
factors for the formation, propagation, evolution, and resulting
geoeffectiveness of interplanetary Multi-MC.

firms. Similar to social norms or conventions, it is an emergent feature
resulting from the firms' interaction in an economic network. To model these
dynamics, we consider a distributed agent population, representing e.g. firms
or individuals. Further, we build on a continuous opinion dynamics model with
bounded confidence ($\epsilon$), which assumes that two agents only interact if
differences in their behaviour are less than $\epsilon$. Interaction results in
more similarity of behaviour, i.e. convergence towards a common mean. This
framework is extended by two major concepts: (i) The agent's in-group
consisting of acquainted interaction partners is explicitly taken into account.
This leads to an effective agent behaviour reflecting that agents try to
continue to interact with past partners and thus to keep sufficiently close to
them. (ii) The in-group network structure changes over time, as agents can form
new links to other agents with sufficiently close effective behaviour or delete
links to agents no longer close in behaviour. Thus, our model provides a
feedback mechanism between the agents' behaviour and their in-group structure.
Studying its consequences by means of agent-based computer simulations, we find
that for narrow-minded agents (low $\epsilon$) the additional feedback helps to
find consensus more often, whereas for open-minded agents (high $\epsilon$)
this does not hold. This counterintuitive result is explained by simulations of
the network evolution.

with an individual inertia to change their opinion. This inertia depends on the
persistence time of a voter's current opinion (ageing). We focus on the case of
only two different inertia values: zero if a voter just changed towards a new
opinion and $\nu$ otherwise. We are interested in the average time to reach
consensus, i.e. the state in which all voters have adopted the same opinion.
Adding inertia to the system means to slow down the dynamics at the voter's
level, which should presumably lead to a slower consensus formation. As an
unexpected outcome of our inertial voter dynamics, there is a parameter region
of $\nu$ where an increasing inertia leads to a faster consensus formation.
These results rest on the heterogeneity of voters which evolves through the
described ageing. In a control setting of homogeneous inertia values, we only
find monotonously increasing consensus times. In the paper, we present
dynamical equations for the mean-field case which allow for analytical insight

corona, the orientations are only determined respectively by their heliographic
locations. OC is investigated in contrast with the results in DC
\citep{Xiong2006}. The shock front behaves as a smooth arc. The cannibalized
part of MC is highly compressed by the shock front along its normal. As the
shock propagates gradually into the preceding MC body, the most violent
interaction is transferred sideways with an accompanying significant narrowing
of the MC's angular width. The opposite deflections of MC body and shock
aphelion in OC occur simultaneously through the process of the shock
penetrating the MC. After the shock's passage, the MC is restored to its oblate
morphology. With the decrease of MC-shock commencement interval, the shock
front at 1 AU traverses MC body and is responsible for the same change trend of
the latitude of the greatest geoeffectiveness of MC-shock compound. Regardless
of shock orientation, shock penetration location regarding the maximum
geoeffectiveness is right at MC core on the condition of very strong shock
intensity. An appropriate angular difference between the initial eruption of an
MC and an overtaking shock leads to the maximum deflection of the MC body. The
larger the shock intensity is, the greater is the deflection angle. The
interaction of MCs with other disturbances could be a cause of deflected

injected with very strong inherent magnetic field over that in the ambient flow
and expands rapidly in size initially. Consequently, the diameter of MC
increases in an asymptotic speed while its angular width contracts gradually.
Meanwhile, simulations of MC-shock interaction are also presented, in which
both a typical MC and a strong fast shock emerge from the inner boundary and
propagate along heliospheric equator, separated by an appropriate interval. The
results show that the shock firstly catches up with the preceding MC, then
penetrates through the MC, and finally merges with the MC-driven shock into a
stronger compound shock. The morphologies of shock front in interplanetary
space and MC body behave as a central concave and a smooth arc respectively.
The compression and rotation of magnetic field serve as an efficient mechanism
to cause a large geomagnetic storm. The MC is highly compressed by the the
overtaking shock. Contrarily, the transport time of incidental shock influenced
by the MC depends on the interval between their commencements. Maximum
geoeffectiveness results from that when the shock enters the core of preceding
MC, which is also substantiated to some extent by a corresponding simplified
analytic model. Quantified by $Dst$ index, the specific result gives that the
geoeffectiveness of an individual MC is largely enhanced with 80% increment in
maximum by an incidental shock.

strongly with redshift, distorts the VHE energy spectra observed from distant
objects. The observed energy spectra of the AGNs carry therefore an imprint of
the EBL. Recent detections of hard spectra of distant blazars (z = 0.11 - 0.54)

presents a method for discovering high-level student behaviors from a very
large set of low-level traces corresponding to problem-solving actions in a
learning environment. Basic actions are encoded into sets of domain-dependent
attribute-value patterns called cases. Then a domain-independent hierarchical
clustering identifies what we call general attitudes, yielding automatic
diagnosis expressed in natural language, addressed in principle to teachers.
The method can be applied to individual students or to entire groups, like a
class. We exhibit examples of this system applied to thousands of students'
actions in the domain of algebraic transformations.

Whereas it is well grounded on the classical leastsquares criterion, a new
normalization reveals a very simple form of the solution matrix. Numerical
simulations shown that the algorithm, named SDIAG (spheric diagonalization),
behaves well as compared to state-of-the art AJD algorithms.

  The overall framework, a Framework for Evolving Topology Analysis (FETA), is
tested on data sets collected from the Internet AS-level topology, social
networking websites and a co-authorship network. Statistical models of the
growth of these networks are produced and tested using a likelihood-based
method. The models are then used to generate artificial topologies with the
same statistical properties as the originals. This work can be used to predict
future growth patterns for a known network, or to generate artificial models of
graph topology evolution for simulation purposes. Particular application
examples include strategic network planning, user profiling in social networks

annihilation at centre-of-mass energies between 14 and 209 GeV. In contrast to
Monte Carlo models for hadronisation, analytical models require to adjust only
two universal parameters, the strong coupling and a second quantity
parametrising nonperturbative corrections. The extracted values of as are
consistent with the world average and competitive with previous measurements.
The variance of event shape distributions is compared with predictions given by

stringency required in proteomic data generation and analysis appears to have
been underestimated. As a result, there are likely to be numerous published
findings that are of questionable quality, requiring further confirmation
