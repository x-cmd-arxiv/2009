dusty atmospheres. Asymmetries of the dwarf surface may arise from
rotationally-induced flattening and dust-cloud coverage, and may result in
non-zero linear polarisation through dust scattering.
  We aim to study the heterogeneity of ultra-cool dwarfs' atmospheres and the
grain-size effects on the polarisation degree in a sample of nine late M, L and
early T dwarfs.
  We obtain linear polarimetric imaging measurements using FORS1 at the Very
Large Telescope, in the Bessel I filter, and for a subset in the Bessel R and
the Gunn z filters.
  We measure a polarisation degree of (0.31+/-0.06)% for LHS102BC. We fail to
detect linear polarisation in the rest of our sample, with upper-limits on the
polarisation degree of each object of 0.09% to 0.76% (95% CL). For those
targets we do not find evidence of large-scale cloud horizontal structure in
our data. Together with previous surveys, our results set the fraction of
ultra-cool dwarfs with detected linear polarisation to (30+10-6)% (1-sigma).
  For three brown dwarfs, our observations indicate polarisation degrees
different (at the 3-sigma level) than previously reported, giving hints of
possible variations.
  Our results fail to correlate with the current model predictions for
ultra-cool dwarf polarisation for a flattening-induced polarisation, or with
the variability studies for a polarisation induced by an hetereneous cloud
cover. This stresses the intricacy of each of those tasks, but may as well
proceed from complex and dynamic atmospheric processes.

for investigating stellar formation in the solar neighborhood. Previous results
have confirmed that a non-negligible fraction of old main-sequence stars is
present in the lists of possible members of young stellar kinematic groups. A
detailed study of the properties of these samples is needed to separate the
young stars from old main-sequence stars with similar space motion, and
identify the origin of these structures. We used stars possible members of the
young (~ 10 - 650 Myr) moving groups from the literature. To determine the age
of the stars, we used several suitable age indicators for young main sequence
stars, i.e., X-ray fluxes and other photometric data. We also used
spectroscopic data, in particular the equivalent width of the lithium line Li I
and Halpha, to constrain the range of ages of the stars. By combining
photometric and spectroscopic data, we were able to separate the young stars
(10 - 650 Myr) from the old (> 1 Gyr) field ones. We found, in particular, that
the Local Association is contaminated by old field stars at the level of ~30%.
This value must be considered as the contamination for our particular sample,
and not of the entire Local Association. For other young moving groups, it is
more difficult to estimate the fraction of old stars among possible members.
However, the level of X-ray emission can, at least, help to separate two age
populations: stars with <200 Myr and stars older than this. Our results are
consistent with a scenario in which the moving groups contain both groups of
young stars formed in a recent star-formation episode and old field stars with
similar space motion. Only by combining X-ray and optical spectroscopic data is
it possible to distinguish between these two age populations.

The mass outflow rates are, however, difficult to estimate since the volume
filling factors of the winds are unknown. In this paper, we use constraints
imposed by the observed radio emission to obtain upper limits to the volume
filling factors of wind components in certain nearby AGN. We do this by
predicting the 1.4 GHz radio flux densities emitted by those components,
assuming a uniform wind, and then comparing these with the observed flux
densities for each AGN at this frequency. We find that the upper limits to the
volume filling factors are in the range 10^{-4}-0.5.

agreement with the strong molecular line emission already detected in a few
high redshift galaxies and approximately consistent with inferences from
studies of the damped Lyman-alpha absorbers seen in the spectra of quasars. The
cosmic H2/HI-ratio is predicted to evolve monotonically as Omega(H2)/Omega(HI)
(1+z)^1.6. This decline of the H2/HI-ratio as a function of cosmic time is
driven by the growth of galactic disks and the progressive reduction of the

problem of protecting sensitive information becomes more serious. In

likely that information included in an ontology, while not itself deemed

  We first consider the problem of testing an ontology for safeness defined as

predict the rotationally modulated light curve of the star. We also obtained
additional photometric measurements and employed our own regression procedure

that the silicon bound-free transitions and iron bound-bound transitions
provide the main contribution to the flux redistribution, although an
additional source of opacity is needed. We confirm that numerous iron lines
significantly contribute to the well-known depression at 5200 A and discuss the
connection between iron abundance and the value of peculiarity index a. The

divides scales into two physically distinct ranges. For scales larger than the
Larmor radius, we derive the familiar Charney--Hasegawa--Mima (CHM) equation
from the gyrokinetic system, and explain its relationship to gyrokinetics. At
scales smaller than the Larmor radius, a dual cascade occurs in phase space
(two dimensions in position space plus one dimension in velocity space) via a
nonlinear phase-mixing process. We show that at these sub-Larmor scales, the
turbulence is self-similar and exhibits power law spectra in position and
velocity space. We propose a Hankel-transform formalism to characterise
velocity-space spectra. We derive the exact relations for third-order structure

results show that simulations of gas--rich major mergers including star
formation, black hole growth, and feedback can produce warm (U)LIRGs. We also
find that while the warm evolutionary phase is associated with increased AGN
activity, star formation alone may be sufficient to produce warm IR colours.
However, the transition can be suppressed entirely - even when there is a
significant AGN contribution - when we assume a single-phase ISM, which
maximizes the attenuation. Finally, our evolutionary models are consistent with
the 25-to-60 micron flux density ratio vs. L_HX/L_IR relation for local LIRGs
and ULIRGs, and predict the observed scatter in IR color at fixed L_HX/L_IR.
Therefore, our models suggest a cautionary note in the interpretation of warm
IR colours: while associated with periods of active black hole growth, they are
probably produced by a complex mix of star formation and AGN activity
intermediate between the cold star formation dominated phase and the birth of a
bright, unobscured quasar.

astronomical objects. Although terrestrial parallax was pioneered over 2000
years ago by Hipparchus (ca. 140 BCE) to measure the distance to the Moon, the
baseline of the Earth is so small that terrestrial parallax can generally only
be applied to objects in the Solar System. However, there exists a class of
extreme gravitational microlensing events in which the effects of terrestrial
parallax can be readily detected and so permit the measurement of the distance,
mass, and transverse velocity of the lens. Here we report observations of the
first such extreme microlensing event OGLE-2007-BLG-224, from which we infer
that the lens is a brown dwarf of mass M=0.056 +- 0.004 Msun, with a distance
of 525 +- 40 pc and a transverse velocity of 113 +- 21 km/s. The velocity
places the lens in the thick disk, making this the lowest-mass thick-disk brown
dwarf detected so far. Follow-up observations may allow one to observe the
light from the brown dwarf itself, thus serving as an important constraint for
evolutionary models of these objects and potentially opening a new window on
sub-stellar objects. The low a priori probability of detecting a thick-disk
brown dwarf in this event, when combined with additional evidence from other
observations, suggests that old substellar objects may be more common than
previously assumed.

from AGN scaling relationships, e.g., it was previously a ~2-3sigma outlier on
the relationship between the broad-line region (BLR) radius and the optical
continuum luminosity - the R_BLR-L relationship. Our new measurements of the
lag time between variations in the continuum and Hbeta emission line made from
spectroscopic monitoring of NGC 4051 lead to a measured BLR radius of R_BLR =
1.87 (+0.54 -0.50) light days and black hole mass of M_BH = 1.73 (+0.55 -0.52)

vertex corrections in two- and three-dimensional systems, for arbitrary

curvature. We show that only for backward scattering in D=2 does the lowest
order vertex correction diverge logarithmically in the zero frequency limit. In
all other cases, the vertex corrections approach a finite (albeit possibly
large) value in the zero frequency limit. We demonstrate that vertex
corrections are strongly suppressed with increasing curvature of the fermionic
bands. Moreover, we show how the frequency dependence of vertex corrections
varies with the scattering angle. We also discuss the form of higher order
ladder vertex corrections and show that they can be classified according to the
zero-frequency limit of the lowest order vertex correction. We show that even
in those cases where the latter is finite, summing up an infinite series of
ladder vertex diagrams can lead to a strong enhancement (or divergence) of the
impurity's scattering potential. Finally, we suggest that the combined
frequency and angular dependence of vertex corrections might be experimentally
observable via a combination of frequency dependent and local measurements,

Croton et al.(2006), De Lucia & Blaizot(2007) and Marulli et al.(2008) to the
output of the Millennium Run and obtained hundreds of realizations of past
light-cones from which we have extracted realistic mock AGN catalogues that
mimic the Chandra deep fields. We find that the model AGN number counts are in
fair agreement with observations, except at fluxes <1e-15 erg/cm^2/s. The
spatial two-point correlation function predicted by the model is well described
by a power-law relation out to 20 Mpc/h, in close agreement with observations.
Our model matches the correlation length r_0 of AGN in the Chandra Deep Field
North but underestimates it in the Chandra Deep Field South. When fixing the
slope to gamma = 1.4, as in Gilli et al. (2005), the statistical significance
of the mismatch is 2-2.5 sigma, suggesting that the predicted cosmic variance,
which dominates the error budget, may not account for the different correlation
length of the AGN in the two fields. While our results are robust to changes in
the model prescriptions for the AGN lightcurves, the luminosity dependence of
the clustering is sensitive to the different lightcurve models adopted.
However, irrespective of the model considered, the luminosity dependence of the
AGN clustering in our mock fields seems to be weaker than in the real Chandra
fields. The significance of this mismatch needs to be confirmed using larger
datasets.

arising in numerical computation of the Evans function, in particular (i) the
advantage of centered coordinates for exterior product and related methods, and
(ii) the unexpected stability of the (notoriously unstable) continuous
orthogonalization method of Drury in the context of Evans function
applications. The analysis in both cases centers around a numerical version of
the gap lemma of Gardner--Zumbrun and Kapitula--Sandstede, giving uniform error
estimates for apparently ill-posed projective boundary-value problems with
asymptotically constant coefficients, so long as the rate of convergence of
coefficients is greater than the ""badness"" of the boundary projections as
measured by negative spectral gap. In the second case, we use also the simple
but apparently previously unremarked observation that the Drury method is in
fact (neutrally) stable when used to approximate an unstable subspace, so that
continuous orthogonalization and the centered exterior product method are
roughly equally well-conditioned as methods for Evans function approximation.
The latter observation makes possible an extremely simple nonlinear
boundary-value method for possible use in large-scale systems, extending ideas
suggested by Sandstede. We suggest also a related linear method based on the
conjugation lemma of M\'etivier--Zumbrun, an extension of the gap lemma
mentioned above.

special cases only span a subset of measure zero. In other words, for almost

asymmetric complex signaling - i.e., the inputs are chosen to be complex but
not circularly symmetric. It is shown that unlike Gaussian point-to-point,
multiple-access and broadcast channels where circularly symmetric complex
Gaussian inputs are optimal, for interference channels optimal inputs are in
general asymmetric. With asymmetric complex signaling, we also show that the 2

employed to extract the optical constants of the incipient metallic puddles at

marked-up software resources that can be published, discovered, composed and

the future Semantic Web, in which networked computer programs become providers
and users of information at the same time. This work focuses on developing a
full-life-cycle software toolset for creating and maintaining Semantic Web
Services (SWSs) based on the Web Service Modelling Ontology (WSMO) framework. A
main part of WSMO-based SWS is service capability - a declarative description
of Web service functionality. A formal syntax and semantics for such a
description is provided by Web Service Modeling Language (WSML), which is based
on different logical formalisms, namely, Description Logics, First-Order Logic
and Logic Programming. A WSML description of a Web service capability is
represented as a set of complex logical expressions (axioms). We develop a
specialized user-friendly tool for constructing and editing WSMO-based SWS
capabilities. Since the users of this tool are not specialists in first-order
logic, a graphical way for constricting and editing axioms is proposed. The
designed process for constructing logical expressions is ontology-driven, which
abstracts away as much as possible from any concrete syntax of logical
language. We propose several mechanisms to guarantees the semantic consistency
of the produced logical expressions. The tool is implemented in Java using
Eclipse for IDE and GEF (Graphical Editing Framework) for visualization.

density recovered from our VLBI image is 0.8$\pm$0.3 mJy (one standard

confused with a possible close by noise peak. In such a case, the recovered

reversal of flux) is detected which is the result of an induced dynamical
symmetry breaking mechanism in conjunction with the nonlinearity of the lattice
dynamics. Computer simulations demonstrate that the heat flux is robust against
an increase of lattice sizes. The observed ratchet effect for such directed
heat currents is quite sizable for our studied class of homogenous nonlinear
lattice structures, thereby making this setup accessible for experimental
implementation and verification.

characterized through the Lyapunov spectrum and the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy,
$h_{KS}$, for a wide range of densities and moments of inertia $I$. For small
$I$ the spectrum separates into translation-dominated and rotation-dominated
parts. With increasing $I$ the rotation-dominated part is gradually filled in
at the expense of translation, until such a separation becomes meaningless. At
any density, the rate of phase-space mixing, given by $h_{KS}$, becomes less
and less effective the more the rotation affects the dynamics. However, the
degree of dynamical chaos, measured by the maximum Lyapunov exponent, is only
enhanced by the rotational degrees of freedom for high-density gases, but is
diminished for lower densities. Surprisingly, no traces of Lyapunov modes were
found in the spectrum for larger moments of inertia. The spatial localization
of the perturbation vector associated with the maximum exponent however
persists for any $I$.

translate into the requirements that all the derivatives, fermions and

not only to the matter sector, but also to the gravitational one if present,

how to determine the unique exactly supersymmetric theory that approximates

heavy superfields in an algebraic and manifestly supersymmetric way, which
turns out to hold in the same form both for globally and locally supersymmetric

affects the accuracy of the PMI estimation by up to 75%. We found that PMI
calculations based on one mean temperature value differ by up to 65% from PMIs
based on an 12-hourly time temperature profile. Differences of 2\degree C in
the estimation of the crime scene temperature result in a deviation in PMI
calculation of 15 - 30%.

theory reduces to classical time-retarded electromagnetic field theory in the
linearized approximation. This report shows that time-retarded field theory
applied to the Earth's transverse gravitational field gives rise to a small
change in the speed of a spacecraft during a flyby. The speed change depends on
the time dependence of the transverse gravitational field, which generates an
induction field that is proportional to the time derivative of the transverse
gravitational field. If the corresponding speed for the induction field is set
equal to (4.130+-0.003) times the Earth's equatorial rotational surface speed,
and the speed of the Earth's gravitational field is set equal to (1.060+-0.001)
times the vacuum speed of light, the calculated value for the speed change for
the NEAR flyby agrees exactly with the observed value. Similar results are
found for the remaining five flybys.

galaxy mergers that underscore the vital role played by gas dissipation in
promoting BH inspiral down to the smallest scales ever probed with use of
high-resolution numerical simulations. In major mergers, the BHs sink rapidly
under the action of gas-dynamical friction while orbiting inside the massive
nuclear disc resulting from the merger. The BHs then bind and form a Keplerian
binary on a scale of 5 pc. In minor mergers, BH pairing proceeds down to the
minimum scale explored of 10-100 pc only when the gas fraction in the less
massive galaxy is comparatively large to avoid its tidal and/or ram pressure
disruption and the wandering of the light BH in the periphery of the main halo.
Binary BHs enter the gravitational wave dominated inspiral only when their
relative distance is typically of 0.001 pc. If the gas preserves the degree of
dissipation expected in a star-burst environment, binary decay continues down
to 0.1 pc, the smallest length-scale ever attained. Stalling versus hardening
below 0.1 pc is still matter of deep investigations.

countable-dimensional finitary representation $V$. Such a Lie algebra is a
split extension of an abelian Lie algebra by a direct sum of copies of
$\sl_\infty$, $\so_\infty$, $\sp_\infty$, and finite-dimensional simple Lie
algebras. A parabolic subalgebra of $\g$ is any subalgebra which contains a
maximal locally solvable (that is, Borel) subalgebra. Building upon work by
Dimitrov and the authors of the present paper, we give a general description of
parabolic subalgebras of $\g$ in terms of joint stabilizers of taut couples of
generalized flags. The main differences with the Borel subalgebra case are that
the description of general parabolic subalgebras has to use both the natural
and conatural modules, and that the parabolic subalgebras are singled out by
further ""trace conditions"" in the suitable joint stabilizer.
  The technique of taut couples can also be used to prove the existence of a
Levi component of an arbitrary subalgebra $\k$ of $\gl_\infty$. If $\k$ is
splittable, we show that the linear nilradical admits a locally reductive
complement in $\k$. We conclude the paper with descriptions of Cartan, Borel,
and parabolic subalgebras of arbitrary splittable subalgebras of $\gl_\infty$.

noncommutativity between momenta is shown to be relevant. We also discuss some
qualitative features of the GQW such as the Berry phase. In the context of
quantum cosmology we consider a Kantowski-Sachs cosmological model and obtain
the Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation for the noncommutative system through the ADM
formalism and a suitable Seiberg-Witten (SW) map. The WDW equation is
explicitly dependent on the noncommutative parameters, $\theta$ and $\eta$. We
obtain numerical solutions of the noncommutative WDW equation for different

in the momenta sector leads to a damped wave function implying that this type
of noncommmutativity can be relevant for a selection of possible initial states
for the universe.

wormholes, with the LL-branes occupying their throats. Here a major role is
being played by the dynamical LL-brane tension which turns out to be negative
but may be of arbitrary small magnitude. As a particular solution we obtain
traversable wormhole with Schwarzschild geometry generated by a LL-brane
positioned at the wormhole throat, which represents the correct consistent
realization of the original Einstein-Rosen ""bridge"" manifold.

delivery to Earth via meteorites. We combine observational and experimental
data of amino acid frequencies formed by these diverse mechanisms and show
that, regardless of the source, these ten early amino acids can be ranked in
order of decreasing abundance in prebiotic contexts. This order can be
predicted by thermodynamics. The relative abundances of the early amino acids
were most likely reflected in the composition of the first proteins at the time
the genetic code originated. The remaining amino acids were incorporated into
proteins after pathways for their biochemical synthesis evolved. This is
consistent with theories of the evolution of the genetic code by stepwise
addition of new amino acids. These are hints that key aspects of early
biochemistry may be universal.

$AdS_3$ spacetime by combining the two mass terms of topological massive
gravity and new massive gravity theory. We study the linearized excitations
around the $AdS_3$ background and find that at a specific value of a certain
combination of the two mass parameters (chiral line), one of the massive
graviton solutions becomes the left moving massless mode. It is shown that the
theory is chiral at this line under Brown-Henneaux boundary condition. Because
of this degeneration of the gravitons the new log solution which has a
logarithmic asymptotic behavior is also a solution to this gravity theory at
the chiral line. The log boundary condition which was proposed to accommodate
this log solution is proved to be consistent at this chiral line. The resulting
theory is no longer chiral except at a special point on the chiral line, where
another new solution with log-square asymptotic behavior exists. At this
special point, we prove that a new kind of boundary condition called log-square
boundary condition, which accommodates this new solution, can be consistent.

Westerbork telescope in the 140--160 MHz range with a 2 arcmin resolution aimed
at characterizing the properties of the foregrounds for epoch of reionization
experiments. For the first time we have detected fluctuations in the Galactic
diffuse emission on scales greater than 13 arcmin at 150 MHz, in the low
Galactic latitude area known as Fan region. Those fluctuations have an $rms$ of
14 K. The total intensity power spectrum shows a power--law behaviour down to
$\ell \sim 900$ with slope $\beta^I_\ell = -2.2 \pm 0.3$. The detection of
diffuse emission at smaller angular scales is limited by residual point
sources. We measured an $rms$ confusion noise of $\sim$3 mJy beam$^{-1}$.
Diffuse polarized emission was also detected for the first time at this
frequency. The polarized signal shows complex structure both spatially and
along the line of sight. The polarization power spectrum shows a power--law
behaviour down to $\ell \sim 2700$ with slope $\beta^P_\ell = -1.65 \pm 0.15$.
The $rms$ of polarization fluctuations is 7.2 K on 4 arcmin scales. By
extrapolating the measured spectrum of total intensity emission, we find a
contamination on the cosmological signal of $\delta T= \sqrt{\ell (\ell+1)
C^I_\ell / 2\pi} \sim 5.7$ K on 5 arcmin scales and a corresponding $rms$ value
of $\sim$18.3 K at the same angular scale. The level of the polarization power
spectrum is $\delta T \sim 3.3$ K on 5 arcmin scales. Given its exceptionally
bright polarized signal, the Fan region is likely to represent an upper limit
on the sky brightness at moderate and high Galactic latitude.
