propagation of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) surface waves travelling along an
ideal incompressible flowing plasma slab surrounded by flowing plasma
environment in the framework of the Hall magnetohydrodynamics. The propagation
properties of the waves are studied in a reference frame moving with the mass
flow outside the slab. In general, flows change the waves' phase velocities
compared to their magnitudes in a static MHD plasma slab and the Hall effect
limits the range of waves' propagation. On the other hand, when the relative
Alfvenic Mach number is negative, the flow extends the waves propagation range
beyond that limit (owing to the Hall effect) and can cause the triggering of
the Kelvin--Helmholtz instability whose onset begins at specific critical wave
numbers. It turns out that the interval of Alfvenic Mach numbers for which the
surface modes are unstable critically depends on the ratio between mass
densities outside and inside the flux tube.

the decoding complexity and the code rate trade-off is dealt when the full
diversity is achieved. In this paper, two designs of STBC are proposed for any
number of transmit antennas that can obtain full diversity when a PIC group
decoding (with a particular grouping scheme) is applied at receiver. With the
PIC group decoding and an appropriate grouping scheme for the decoding, the
proposed STBC are shown to obtain the same diversity gain as the ML decoding,
but have a low decoding complexity. The first proposed STBC is designed with
multiple diagonal layers and it can obtain the full diversity for two-layer
design with the PIC group decoding and the rate is up to 2 symbols per channel
use. But with PIC-SIC group decoding, the first proposed STBC can obtain full
diversity for any number of layers and the rate can be full. The second
proposed STBC can obtain full diversity and a rate up to 9/4 with the PIC group
decoding. Some code design examples are given and simulation results show that
the newly proposed STBC can well address the rate-performance-complexity
tradeoff of the MIMO systems.

intermediate clean regime, with a broadening comparable to or larger than the

self energy, induced fields and currents are obtained by a self-consistent
calculation of the distribution functions and the excitation spectrum. Using

obtained at the 6-m telescope of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Another

method based on the non-linear modeling of the neutral hydrogen density profile

young, massive stars highly enshrouded in their natal gas and dust clouds. Our
sample primarily consists of 277 objects we identify as having spectral
features indicative of embedded YSOs. The remaining sources are comprised of 7
C-rich evolved sources, 8 sources dominated by broad silicate emission, and 1
source with multiple broad emission features. Those with YSO-like spectra show
a range of spectral features including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon
emission, deep silicate absorption, fine-structure lines, and ice absorption
features. Based upon the relative strengths of these features, we have
classified the YSO candidates into several distinct categories using the

propose that these categories represent a spectrum of evolutionary stages
during massive YSO formation. We conclude that massive pre-main sequence stars
spend a majority of their massive, embedded lives emitting in the UV. Half of
the sources in our study have features typical of compact HII regions,
suggesting that massive YSOs can create a detectable compact HII region
half-way through the formation time present in our sample. This study also
provides a check on commonly used source-selection procedures including the use
of photometry to identify YSOs. We determine a high success rate (>95%) of
identifying objects with YSO-like spectra can be achieved through careful use

ratios of the [O IV] to lower ionization lines are similar to those observed in

the full SED for the ULX and its companion. The preferred model to describe the
SED includes an accretion disk which dominates the soft X-rays but contributes
little at UV and optical wavelengths. The optical counterpart is consistent
with a B supergiant as previously suggested in other studies. The bolometric
luminosity of the ULX suggests the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole
with mass $>$85 M$_\odot$ for sub-Eddington accretion or, alternatively, a
stellar-mass black hole that is accreting at super-Eddington rates. In a

HDC generalizes the well-known average-consensus algorithm. It divides the
nodes of the large-scale network into anchors and sensors. Anchors are nodes
whose states are fixed over the HDC iterations, whereas sensors are nodes that
update their states as a linear combination of the neighboring states. Under
appropriate conditions, we show that the sensor states converge to a linear
combination of the anchor states. Through the concept of anchors, HDC captures
in a unified framework several interesting network tasks, including distributed
sensor localization, leader-follower, distributed Jacobi to solve linear
systems of algebraic equations, and, of course, average-consensus. In many
network applications, it is of interest to learn the weights of the distributed
linear algorithm so that the sensors converge to a desired state. We term this
inverse problem the HDC learning problem. We pose learning in HDC as a
constrained non-convex optimization problem, which we cast in the framework of
multi-objective optimization (MOP) and to which we apply Pareto optimality. We
prove analytically relevant properties of the MOP solutions and of the Pareto
front from which we derive the solution to learning in HDC. Finally, the paper
shows how the MOP approach resolves interesting tradeoffs (speed of convergence
versus quality of the final state) arising in learning in HDC in resource
constrained networks.

obtained suppressing the elementary scalar fields, and argue that it can
reproduce the known low energy physics. In the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio spirit, we
show, using a large N_c expansion, that a dynamical symmetry breaking takes
place. The effective potential has a Lorentz invariant minimum and the Lorentz
violation does not reverberate down to low energies. The mechanism generates
fermion masses, gauge-boson masses and scalar bound states, to be identified
with composite Higgs bosons. Our approach is not plagued by the ambiguities of

sampling strategy to collect data from hard-to-reach populations. By tracing
the links in the underlying social network, the process exploits the social
structure to expand the sample and reduce its dependence on the initial
(convenience) sample.
  The primary goal of RDS is typically to estimate population averages in the
hard-to-reach population. The current estimates make strong assumptions in
order to treat the data as a probability sample. In particular, we evaluate
three critical sensitivities of the estimators: to bias induced by the initial
sample, to uncontrollable features of respondent behavior, and to the
without-replacement structure of sampling.
  This paper sounds a cautionary note for the users of RDS. While current RDS
methodology is powerful and clever, the favorable statistical properties
claimed for the current estimates are shown to be heavily dependent on often
unrealistic assumptions.

with available observational data of proper motions, we derive the intrinsic
velocity as well as the viewing angles to the line of sight for eight knotty
regions down the M87 jet. The results favor the 'modest beaming' scenario along
the jet, with Doppler factors varying between 2-5. The inner jet of M87 suffers
sharp deceleration, and the intrinsic speed remains roughly constant down the
outer jet. The orientation of the inner jet regions is fully consistent with
the result of 10deg-19deg to the line of sight suggested by previous Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) proper motion studies of the M87 jet. The outer jet,
however, shows systematic deflection off the inner jet to much smaller
inclination (<<10deg). Further calculation of knot A suggests this deflection
can be regarded as evidence that the outer jet suffers some departure from
equipartition. The nucleus region of the M87 jet should have a viewing angle
close to its first knot HST-1, i.e. ~15deg, which favors the idea that M87 may
be a misaligned blazar. This work provides some hints about the overall
dynamics of this famous extragalactic jet.

interestingly, the crystal orientation, and thus, superconductivity in these

preferably along c-axis, but the onset of superconductivity depends on film
thickness. At 500C, films grow along (101), with little thickness dependence.

contractible (thus all leaves are K(pi,1)'s for some pi). In the first part of
the paper we show that the tangential Lusternik--Schnirelmann category cat F of
a K(pi,1)-foliation F on a manifold M is bounded from below by t-codim F for
any t with H_t(M;A) nonzero for some coefficient group A. Since for any
C^2-foliation F one has cat F <= dim F by our Theorem 5.2 of [Topology 42
(2003) 603-627], this implies that cat F = dim F for K(pi,1)-foliations of
class C^2 on closed manifolds.
  For K(pi,1)-foliations on open manifolds the above estimate is far from
optimal, so one might hope for some other homological lower bound for cat F. In
the second part we see that foliated cohomology will not work. For we show that
the p-th foliated cohomology group of a p-dimensional foliation of positive
codimension is an infinite dimensional vector space, if the foliation is
obtained from a foliation of a manifold by removing an appropriate closed set,
for example a point. But there are simple examples of K(pi,1)-foliations of
this type with cat F < dim F. Other, more interesting examples of
K(pi,1)-foliations on open manifolds are provided by the finitely punctured
Reeb foliations on lens spaces whose tangential category we calculate.
  In the final section we show that C^1-foliations of tangential category at
most 1 on closed manifolds are locally trivial homotopy sphere bundles. Thus
among 2-dimensional C^2-foliations on closed manifolds the only ones whose
tangential category is still unknown are those which are 2-sphere bundles which
do not admit sections.

counterintuitive result on irreducible multiparty correlations: although the
degree of the total correlation in a three-party quantum state does not
increase under local operations, the irreducible three-party correlation can be
created by local operations from a three-party state with only irreducible
two-party correlations. In other words, even if a three-party state is
initially completely determined by measuring two-party Hermitian operators, the
determination of the state after local operations have to resort to the
measurements of three-party Hermitian operators.
