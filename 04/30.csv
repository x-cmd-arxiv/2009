fermions as a prototype of a strongly correlated s-wave fermion superfluid on a
lattice. We show that the collective mode spectrum of this superfluid exhibits,
in addition to the long wavelength sound mode, a sharp roton mode over a wide
range of densities and interaction strengths. We compute the sound velocity and
the roton gap within a generalized random phase approximation (GRPA) and show
that the GRPA results are in good agreement, at strong coupling, with a spin
wave analysis of the appropriate strong-coupling pseudospin model. We also
investigate, using this two-pronged approach, the breakdown of superfluidity in
the presence of a supercurrent. We find that the superflow can break down at a
critical flow momentum via several distinct mechanisms - depairing, Landau
instabilities or dynamical instabilities - depending on the dimensionality, the
interaction strength and the fermion density. The most interesting of these
instabilities is a charge modulation dynamical instability which is distinct
from previously studied dynamical instabilities of Bose superfluids. The charge
order associated with this instability can be of two types: (i) a commensurate
checkerboard modulation driven by softening of the roton mode at the Brillouin
zone corner, or, (ii) an incommensurate density modulation arising from
superflow-induced finite momentum pairing of Bogoliubov quasiparticles. We
elucidate the dynamical phase diagram showing the critical flow momentum of the
leading instability over a wide range of fermion densities and interaction
strengths and point out implications of our results for experiments on cold
atom fermion superfluids in an optical lattice.

a one-loop renormalization group analysis of the corresponding effective field

with a replica average over the disorder. The method is applied not only to
generic uncorrelated on-site disorder but also to simultaneous hopping disorder
correlated with the differences of adjacent disorder potentials. Such
correlations are inherent in fine-grained optical speckle potentials used as a
source of disorder in optical lattice experiments. As a result of strong
coupling, the strength of the replica mixing disorder vertex, responsible for
the emergence of a Bose glass, crucially depends on the chemical potential and
the Hubbard repulsion and vanishes to leading order in the disorder at
commensurate boson fillings. As a consequence, at such fillings a direct
transition between the Mott-insulator and the superfluid in the presence of
disorder cannot be excluded on the basis of a one-loop calculation. At
incommensurate fillings, at a certain length scale, the Mott insulator will
eventually become unstable towards the formation of a Boss glass. Phase
diagrams as a function of the microscopic parameters are presented and the
finite-size crossover between the Mott-insulating state and the Bose glass is
analyzed.

by the simultaneous presence of tetragonal and GdFeO3-type distortions and the
strong Hund's rule coupling between e_g and t_2g electrons. To clarify the

superexchange mechanism by using the local density approximation+dynamical

The tetragonal and GdFeO3-type distortions, however, reduce T_KK to 550 K. Thus
electron-phonon coupling is essential to explain the persistence of local
Jahn-Teller distortions to at least 1150 K and to reproduce the occupied
orbital deduced from neutron scattering.

through a synthetic gauge field. When the lattice strain is time dependent, as
in connection with phononic excitations, the gauge field becomes time dependent
and the synthetic vector potential is also associated with an electric field.
We show that this synthetic electric field has observable consequences. Joule
heating associated with the currents driven by the synthetic electric field
dominates the intrinsic damping, caused by the electron-phonon interaction, of
many acoustic phonon modes of graphene and metallic carbon nanotubes when
including the effects of disorder and Coulomb interactions. Several important
consequences follow from the observation that by time-reversal symmetry, the
synthetic electric field associated with the vector potential has opposite
signs for the two valleys. First, this implies that the synthetic electric
field drives charge-neutral valley currents and is therefore unaffected by
screening. This frequently makes the effects of the synthetic vector potential
more relevant than a competing effect of the scalar deformation potential which
has a much larger bare coupling constant. Second, valley currents decay by
electron-electron scattering (valley Coulomb drag) which causes interesting
temperature dependence of the damping rates. While our theory pertains first
and foremost to metallic systems such as doped graphene and metallic carbon
nanotubes, the underlying mechanisms should also be relevant for semiconducting
carbon nanotubes when they are doped.

In the current paper, a theory of topological regular neighborhoods is
described, which represents the full analogue in TOP of piecewise linear
regular neighborhoods (or block bundles) in PL. In simplest terms, a
topological regular neighborhood of a manifold M locally flatly embedded in a
manifold Q (BdM and BdQ empty) is a closed manifold neighborhood V which is
homeomorphic fixing BdV and M to the mapping cylinder of some proper surjection
BdV-->M. The principal theorem asserts the existence and uniqueness of such
neighborhoods, for dim Q>7. One application is that a cell-like surjection of
cell complexes is a simple homotopy equivalence (first proved for
homeomorphisms by Chapman). There is a notion of transversality for such
neighborhoods, and the theory also holds for locally tamely embedded polyhedral
in topological manifolds.

narrow region of a bond-order phase between these two phases. The phase
transition line for the transition out of the charge-density-wave phase changes
from first-order at strong coupling to second-order in a parameter regime where
all three phases are present. We present evidence that the additional
phase-transition line between the spin-density-wave and bond-order phases is
infinite order. While these results are in agreement with recent numerical
work, our study provides an independent, unbiased means of determining the

found, and provides insight into the limitations of numerical methods in

loop develops an additional 1/\epsilon singularity associated to the
intersection. Interestingly, the same 1/\epsilon pole exists in the finite part
of the one loop amplitude, appearing in the BDS conjecture, at the
corresponding kinematic limit. At two loops, we explore the behaviour of the

conjecture. By analysing the renormalisation group equations for the Wilson
loop with a simple self-crossing, we argue that, when approaching the
configuration with a self-crossing (u_2 \to 1, u_1\approx u_3), R diverges in
the imaginary direction like R ~ i \pi \log^3(1-u_2). This behaviour can be
attributed to the non-trivial analytic continuation needed when passing from
the Euclidean to the physical region and suggests that R has a branch cut in
the negative u_2 axis when the two other cross ratios are approximately equal

this paradox is to show that there is a sequence of linearly unstable shears
which approaches the linear shear in the kinetic energy norm but not in the
enstrophy (vorticity) norm. These oscillatory shears are single Fourier modes
in the Fourier series of all the shears. In experiments, such linear
instabilities will manifest themselves as transient nonlinear growth leading to
the transition from the linear shear to turbulence no matter how small the
intitial perturbations to the linear shear are. Under the Euler dynamics, these
oscillatory shears are steady, and cat's eye structures bifurcate from them as
travelling waves. The 3D shears $U(y,z)$ in a neighborhood of these oscillatory
shears are linearly unstable too. Under the Navier-Stokes dynamics, these
oscillatory shears are not steady rather drifting slowly. When these
oscillatory shears are viewed as frozen, the corresponding Orr-Sommerfeld
operator has unstable eigenvalues which approach the corresponding inviscid
eigenvalues when the Reynolds number tends to infinity. All the linear
instabilities mentioned above offer a resolution to the Sommerfeld paradox, and

superconformal Chern-Simons theory provides an example of pseudo-momentum
diagonalization. For SO(6) sector, we study maximal shuffling and
next-to-maximal shuffling terms in the dilatation operator and compare them
with results expected from psu(2|2) superalgebbra and integrability. At two
loops, we rederive maximal shuffling term (3-site) and find perfect agreement
with known results. At four loops, we first find absence of next-to-maximal
shuffling term (4-site), in agreement with prediction based on integrability.
We next extract maximal shuffling term (5-site), the most relevant term for
checking the possibility of pseudo-momentum diagonalization. Curiously, we find
that result agrees with integraility prediction based on lattice momentum, as
in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. Consistency of our results is fully ensured by
checks of renormalizability up to six loops.

fail over the whole flow, what yields an apparent violation of the

combinations of which have properties that are identical to those of the

infinite number of Lorentz-violating radiative-correction terms in the
low-energy effective Lagrangian. We examine a representative subset of these

graviton modes such that their phase velocity is direction-dependent. If the
phase velocity of the Goldstone gravitons is subluminal, cosmic rays can emit
gravi-Cherenkov radiation, and the detection of high-energy cosmic rays can be
used to constrain these radiative correction terms. Test particles in the
vicinity of the Goldstone gravitons undergo longitudinal oscillations in
addition to the usual transverse oscillations as predicted by general
relativity. Finally, we discuss the possibility of having vevs that do not

reflection of X-ray radiation from a cold accretion disk and also as a result
of the line formation in the extended wind/outflow configuration. Both models

possibility of quadrupolar (spin-nematic) ground states in the presence of
sufficient biquadratic exchange. We argue that quadrupolar correlations are
substantially more robust than the spin-nematic ground state, and give rise to
a two peak structure of the specific heat. We characterize this behavior by a
novel T > 0 semiclassical approximation, which is amenable to efficient Monte
Carlo simulations. Turning to low temperatures, we consider the effects of weak
disorder on incommensurate magnetic order, which is present when interactions
beyond nearest neighbor exchange are substantial. We show that non-magnetic
impurities act as random fields on a component of the order parameter, leading
to the disruption of long-range magnetic order even when the defects are
arbitrarily weak. Instead, a gradual freezing phenomena is expected on lowering
the temperature, with no sharp transition but a rapid slowing of dynamics and
the development of substantial spin-glass-like correlations. We discuss these
observations in relation to measurements of NiGa2S4.

chemically patterned by stripes of same width and different contact angle,
where the three-phase contact line runs, on average, perpendicular to the

absence of pinning. We find that, if the spacing between the plates is large
compared to the length scale of the surface patterning, the cosine of the
macroscopic contact angle corresponds to an average of cosines of the intrinsic
angles of the stripes, as predicted by the Cassie equation. If, however, the
spacing becomes of order the length scale of the pattern there is a sharp
crossover to a regime where the macroscopic contact angle varies between the
intrinsic contact angle of each stripe, as predicted by the local Young
equation. The results are obtained using two numerical methods, Lattice
Boltzmann (a diffuse interface approach) and Surface Evolver (a sharp interface
approach), thus giving a direct comparison of two popular numerical approaches
to calculating drop shapes when applied to a non-trivial contact line problem.
We find that the two methods give consistent results if we take into account a
line tension in the free energy. In the lattice Boltzmann approach, the line
tension arises from discretisation effects at the diffuse three phase contact
line.

we call this approach single-block encoding (SBE). SBE may result in a huge
number of program paths to be explored, which constitutes a fundamental source
of inefficiency. We propose a generalization of the approach, in which
transitions of the ART represent larger portions of the program; we call this
approach large-block encoding (LBE). LBE may reduce the number of paths to be
explored up to exponentially. Within this framework, we also investigate
symbolic representations: for representing abstract states, in addition to
conjunctions as used in SBE, we investigate the use of arbitrary Boolean
formulas; for computing abstract-successor states, in addition to Cartesian
predicate abstraction as used in SBE, we investigate the use of Boolean
predicate abstraction. The new encoding leverages the efficiency of
state-of-the-art SMT solvers, which can symbolically compute abstract
large-block successors. Our experiments on benchmark C programs show that the
large-block encoding outperforms the single-block encoding.

biology. Most existing studies so far have been limited to discrete strategy
spaces with a small number of available actions. In many cases, however, the
choices available to agents are better characterized by continuous spectra.
This paper suggests a generalization of the replicator framework that allows to
study the adaptive dynamics of Q-learning agents with continuous strategy
spaces. Instead of probability vectors, agents strategies are now characterized
by probability measures over continuous variables. As a result, the ordinary
differential equations for the discrete case are replaced by a system of
coupled integral--differential replicator equations that describe the mutual
evolution of individual agent strategies. We derive a set of functional
equations describing the steady state of the replicator dynamics, examine their
solutions for several two-player games, and confirm our analytical results

probability the linearly vertex-reinforced random walk (VRRW) stays within a
finite ""trapping"" subgraph at all large times. The question of whether this
tail behavior occurs with probability one is open in general. In his thesis,
Pemantle (1988) proved, via a dynamical system approach, that for a VRRW on any
complete graph the asymptotic frequency of visits is uniform over vertices.
These techniques do not easily extend even to the setting of complete-like
graphs, that is, complete graphs ornamented with finitely many leaves at each
vertex. In this work we combine martingale and large deviation techniques to
prove that almost surely the VRRW on any such graph spends positive (and equal)
proportions of time on each of its nonleaf vertices. This behavior was
previously shown to occur only up to event of positive probability (cf. Volkov
(2001)). We believe that our approach can be used as a building block in
studying related questions on more general graphs. The same set of techniques
is used to obtain explicit bounds on the speed of convergence of the empirical
occupation measure.

Using new software and techniques, we measured the redshifts of various Ni II,
Fe II, Si II, etc. lines in a damped Ly-alpha system at z=2.309. Roughly half
the data was taken through the Keck iodine cell which contains thousands of
well calibrated iodine lines. Using these iodine exposures to calibrate the
normal Th-Ar Keck data pipeline output we found absolute wavelength offsets of
500 m/s to 1000 m/s with drifts of more than 500 m/s over a single night, and
drifts of nearly 2000 m/s over several nights. These offsets correspond to an
absolute redshift of uncertainty of about Delta z=10^{-5} (Delta lambda= 0.02
Ang), with daily drifts of around Delta z=5x10^{-6} (Delta lambda =0.01 Ang),
and multiday drifts of nearly Delta z=2x10^{-5} (0.04 Ang). The causes of the
wavelength offsets are not known, but since claimed shifts in the fine
structure constant would result in velocity shifts of less than 100 m/s, this
level of systematic uncertainty makes may make it difficult to use Keck HIRES
data to constrain the change in the fine structure constant. Using our
calibrated data, we applied both our own fitting software and standard fitting
software to measure (Delta alpha)/alpha, but discovered that we could obtain
results ranging from significant detection of either sign, to strong null
limits, depending upon which sets of lines and which fitting method was used.
We thus speculate that the discrepant results on (Delta alpha)/alpha reported
in the literature may be due to random fluctuations coming from under-estimated
systematic errors in wavelength calibration and fitting procedure.

(abstract) constraint atoms and their properties. We introduce a succinct
abstract representation of these constraint atoms in which a constraint atom is
represented compactly. We show two applications. First, under this
representation of constraint atoms, we generalize the Gelfond-Lifschitz
transformation and apply it to define stable models (also called answer sets)
for logic programs with arbitrary constraint atoms. The resulting semantics
turns out to coincide with the one defined by Son et al., which is based on a
fixpoint approach. One advantage of our approach is that it can be applied, in
a natural way, to define stable models for disjunctive logic programs with
constraint atoms, which may appear in the disjunctive head as well as in the
body of a rule. As a result, our approach to the stable model semantics for
logic programs with constraint atoms generalizes a number of previous
approaches. Second, we show that our abstract representation of constraint
atoms provides a means to characterize dependencies of atoms in a program with
constraint atoms, so that some standard characterizations and properties
relying on these dependencies in the past for logic programs with ordinary
atoms can be extended to logic programs with constraint atoms.

nonequilibrium-vibration-assisted tunneling through the QD with a single level
($\epsilon_d$) coupled to the vibrational mode. For this purpose, we derive an
explicit analytical expression for the Franck-Condon (FC) factor for a
displaced-distorted oscillator surface of the molecule and establish rate
equations in the joint electron-phonon representation to examine the
current-voltage characteristics and zero-frequency shot noise, and skewness as
well. Our numerical analyses shows that the distortion has two important
effects. The first one is that it breaks the symmetry between the excitation
spectra of the charge states, leading to asymmetric tunneling properties with
respect to $\epsilon_d>0$ and $\epsilon_d<0$. Secondly, distortion (frequency
change of the oscillator) significantly changes the voltage-activated cascaded
transition mechanism, and consequently gives rise to a different nonequilibrium
vibrational distribution from that of the case without distortion. Taken in
conjunction with strongly modified FC factors due to distortion, this results
in some new transport features: the appearance of strong NDC even for a
single-level QD with symmetric tunnel couplings; a giant Fano factor even for a
molecule with an extremely weak electron-phonon interaction; and enhanced
skewness that can have a large negative value under certain conditions.

droplets -- as would be expected for a classical Rayleigh-Plateau instability
-- but instead displayed a long-wavelength instability where all excess fluid
gathered in a single bulge along each stripe. We consider here the dynamics of
the flow instability associated with this setup. We perform a linear stability
analysis of the capillary flow problem in the inviscid limit. We first confirm
previous work showing that that all cylindrical segments are linearly unstable
if (and only if) their apparent contact angle is larger than ninety degrees. We
then demonstrate that the most unstable wavenumber for the surface perturbation
decreases to zero as the apparent contact angle of the fluid on the surface
approaches ninety degrees, allowing us to re-interpret the creation of bulges
in the experiment as a zero-wavenumber capillary instability. A variation of

as the example, and use an elliptical cylindrical wave expansion method to
obtain the scattered field. It is demonstrated that an ideal elliptical
cylindrical cloak is inherently visible. Noticeable field scattering and
penetration will be induced when the cloak is exposed directly to an
electromagnetic wave. However, as long as the cloak consists of a perfect
electric conducting lining at the interior surface, perfect invisibility can
still be achieved along the direction parallel to the major axis of the cloak
for transverse magnetic illumination. Another plane-transformed cloak with a
conical geometry is also proposed. The advantage of this cloak is that all the
permittivity and permeability elements are spatially invariant while none of
them is singular. Hence, it is easily realizable with artificially structured
metamaterials. Finally, we show that this kind of cloak can also be used to
cloak objects on a flat ground plane.

  Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A belief-propagation decoder for low-density lattice codes is given which
represents messages explicitly as a mixture of Gaussians functions. The key
component is an algorithm for approximating a mixture of several Gaussians with
another mixture with a smaller number of Gaussians. This Gaussian mixture
reduction algorithm iteratively reduces the number of Gaussians by minimizing
the distance between the original mixture and an approximation with one fewer
Gaussians.
  Error rates and noise thresholds of this decoder are compared with those for
the previously-proposed decoder which discretely quantizes the messages. The
error rates are indistinguishable for dimension 1000 and 10000 lattices, and
the Gaussian-mixture decoder has a 0.2 dB loss for dimension 100 lattices. The
Gaussian-mixture decoder has a loss of about 0.03 dB in the noise threshold,
which is evaluated via Monte Carlo density evolution. Further, the
Gaussian-mixture decoder uses far less storage for the messages.

cut-elimination proof for a subsystem of analysis with
$\Pi^{1}_{1}$-comprehension. His proof provides cut-free derivations by
familiar rules only for arithmetical sequents. When second-order quantifiers
are present, they are introduced by $\Omega$-rule and some residual cuts are
not eliminated. Using an extension of $\Omega$-rule we obtain (by the same
method as W. Buchholz) complete cut-elimination: any derivation of arbitrary

induction replaced by $\omega$-rule).
  W. Buchholz used $\Omega$-rule to explain how reductions of finite
derivations (used by G. Takeuti for subsystems of analysis) are generated by
cut-elimination steps applied to derivations with $\Omega$-rule. We show that
the same steps generate standard cut-reduction steps for infinitary derivations
with familiar standard rules for second-order quantifiers. This provides an
analysis of $\Omega$-rule in terms of standard rules and ordinal-free

plays a key role in our approach. We organize the survey around the objective
of computing a certain homotopy-invariant of a space equipped with a proper
action of a group or groupoid called the Lefschetz map. The Lefschetz map
associates an equivariant K-homology class to an equivariant Kasparov
self-morphism of a space X admitting a dual. We want to describe it explicitly
in the setting of bundles of smooth manifolds over the base space of a proper
groupoid, in which groupoid elements act by diffeomorphisms between fibres. To
get the required description we describe a topological model of equivariant
KK-theory by way of a theory of correspondences, building on ideas of Paul
Baum, Alain Connes and Georges Skandalis that appeared in the 1980's. This
model agrees with the analytic model for bundles of smooth manifolds under some
technical conditions related to the existence of equivariant vector bundles.
Subject to these conditions we obtain a computation of the Lefschetz map in
purely topological terms.

luminosity plane (Owen-White diagram) -- can be explained by the deceleration
of advancing radio lobes. The deceleration is caused by the growth of the
effective cross-sectional area of radio lobes. We derive the condition in which
an initially supersonic lobe turns into a subsonic lobe, combining the
ram-pressure equilibrium between the hot spots and the ambient medium with the
relation between ""the hot spot radius"" and ""the linear size of radio sources""
obtained from the radio observations. We find that the dividing line between
the supersonic lobes and subsonic ones is determined by the ratio of the jet
power $L_{\rm j}$ to the number density of the ambient matter at the core
radius of the host galaxy $\bar{n}_{\rm a}$. It is also found that there exists
the maximal ratio of $(L_{\rm j}/\bar{n}_{\rm a})$ and its value resides in
$(L_{\rm j}/\bar{n}_{\rm a})_{\rm max}\approx 10^{44-47} {\rm erg} {\rm s}^{-1}

consistency of the estimators (convergence to a stable value with the increase
of time series length) and the degree of deviation among the estimators. The
optimization of parameters is assessed by quantifying the deviation of the
estimated mutual information from its true or asymptotic value as a function of
the free parameter. Moreover, some common-used criteria for parameter selection
are evaluated for each estimator. The comparative study is based on Monte Carlo
simulations on time series from several linear and nonlinear systems of
different lengths and noise levels. The results show that the $k$-nearest
neighbor is the most stable and less affected by the method-specific parameter.
A data adaptive criterion for optimal binning is suggested for linear systems
but it is found to be rather conservative for nonlinear systems. It turns out
that the binning and kernel estimators give the least deviation in identifying
the lag of the first minimum of mutual information from nonlinear systems, and
are stable in the presence of noise.

NGC 2997 was obtained by ISAAC/VLT. All sources in the field brighter than K=19
mag were located. Color-color diagrams were used to identify young stellar
complexes among the extended sources. Ages can be estimated for the youngest
complexes and correlated with azimuthal distances from the spiral arms defined
by the K-band intensity variation. The extended sources with Mk <-12 mag
display a diffuse appearance and are more concentrated inside the arm region
than fainter ones, which are compact and uniformly distributed in the disk. The
NIR colors of the bright diffuse objects are consistent with them being young
starforming complexes with ages <10 Myr and reddened by up to 8 mag of visual
extinction. They show a color gradient as a function of their azimuthal
distance from the spiral arms. Interpreting this gradient as an age variation,
the pattern speed Op = 16 km/s/kpc of the main spiral was derived assuming
circular motion. The alignment and color gradient of the bright, diffuse
complexes strongly support a density wave scenario for NGC 2997. Only the
brightest complexes with Mk <-12 mag show a well aligned structure along the
arm, suggesting that a strong compression in the gas due to the spiral
potential is required to form these most massive aggregates, while smaller
starforming regions are formed more randomly in the disk. The sharp transition
between the two groups at Mk = -12 mag may be associated with expulsion of gas
when the first supernovae explode in the complex.

spin-flipping potentials produced by the two target qubits (two fixed spins),

process is analyzed in three dimensions, both to lowest order and in full order

information on the various stages of a heavy-ion collision. At different
transverse momenta (pT), different production processes dominate the direct
photon yield in heavy-ion collisions. Photons at high pT can be used to study
initial hard scattering processes while photons at low and intermediate pT
provide direct information on the hot and dense medium created in such
collisions since they origin predominantly from jet-medium interactions and
from thermal radiation from the medium itself. PHENIX has measured
direct-photon yields over a broad pT and energy range in different collision
systems such as Au+Au and Cu+Cu, allowing systematic studies of the behavior of
direct photons in heavy-ion collisions. Two different methods have been used to
measure the direct photons. An excess of direct photons in Au+Au collisions at
low pT beyond the expectation from p+p collisions was measured for the first
time via internal conversion. Furthermore, the azimuthal anisotropy parameter
v2 has been measured. The direct photon v2 sheds light on the different
processes contributing to the production of direct photons. The p+p data at the
same energy provide a baseline for understanding the heavy-ion data, but are
also interesting in their own right, e.g. for testing pQCD calculations or - as
RHIC collides polarized protons - for constraining models on the gluon
contribution to the proton spin.

problem can also be seen as factorising a $\ddim \times \nsig$ matrix $Y=(y_1

\natoms$ dictionary matrix $\dico$ and a $\natoms \times \nsig$ coefficient

question studied here is when a dictionary coefficient pair $(\dico,\X)$ can be
recovered as local minimum of a (nonconvex) $\ell_1$-criterion with input
$Y=\dico \X$. First, for general dictionaries and coefficient matrices,
algebraic conditions ensuring local identifiability are derived, which are then
specialised to the case when the dictionary is a basis. Finally, assuming a
random Bernoulli-Gaussian sparse model on the coefficient matrix, it is shown
that sufficiently incoherent bases are locally identifiable with high
probability. The perhaps surprising result is that the typically sufficient
number of training samples $\nsig$ grows up to a logarithmic factor only
linearly with the signal dimension, i.e. $\nsig \approx C \natoms \log
\natoms$, in contrast to previous approaches requiring combinatorially many
samples.

Supplementary measurements of HCN(J=1-0), 13CO(J=2-1) and millimeter continuum

division multiple access (CDMA) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO).
Current wireless standards, such as high speed packet access (HSPA), have
adopted multi-code transmission and hybrid-automatic repeat request (ARQ) as
major technologies for delivering high data rates. The key technique in
hybrid-ARQ, is that erroneous data packets are kept in the receiver to
detect/decode retransmitted ones. This strategy is refereed to as packet
combining. In CDMA MIMO-based wireless packet access, multi-code transmission
suffers from severe performance degradation due to the loss of code
orthogonality caused by both interchip interference (ICI) and co-antenna
interference (CAI). This limitation results in large transmission delays when
an ARQ mechanism is used in the link layer. In this paper, we investigate
efficient minimum mean square error (MMSE) frequency domain equalization
(FDE)-based iterative (turbo) packet combining for cyclic prefix (CP)-CDMA MIMO
with Chase-type ARQ. We introduce two turbo packet combining schemes: i) In the
first scheme, namely ""chip-level turbo packet combining"", MMSE FDE and packet
combining are jointly performed at the chip-level. ii) In the second scheme,
namely ""symbol-level turbo packet combining"", chip-level MMSE FDE and
despreading are separately carried out for each transmission, then packet
combining is performed at the level of the soft demapper. The computational
complexity and memory requirements of both techniques are quite insensitive to
the ARQ delay, i.e., maximum number of ARQ rounds. The throughput is evaluated
for some representative antenna configurations and load factors to show the
gains offered by the proposed techniques.

constants are different for different space directions and depend on the

with increasing the density of the $\emph{e}_{g}$ electrons the system
undergoes phase transition from ferromagnetic phase $(0<n<n_c)$ to A-type

the fundamental band gap, typically underestimated by the local density

advance in the terahertz time-domain spectroscopy of electromagnons or
electric-dipole active magnetic resonances, focused on perovskite
manganites--$R$MnO$_3$ ($R$ denotes rare-earth ions). The respective electric
and magnetic contributions to the observed magnetic resonance are firmly
identified by the measurements of the light-polarization dependence using a
complete set of the crystal orientations. We extract general optical features
in a variety of the spin ordered phases, including the $A$-type
antiferromagnetic, collinear spin ordered, and ferroelectric $bc$ and $ab$
spiral spin ordered phases, which are realized by tuning the chemical
composition of $R$, temperature, and external magnetic field. In addition to
the antiferromagnetic resonances of Mn ions driven by the magnetic field
component of light, we clarify that the electromagnon appears only for light
polarized along the a-axis even in the collinear spin ordered phase and grows
in intensity with evolution of the spiral spin order, but independent of the
direction of the spiral spin plane ($bc$ or $ab$) or equivalently the direction
of the ferroelectric polarization $P_{\rm s}$ ($P_{\rm s}\| c$ or $P_{\rm s}\|

further unusual in being the most metal-poor star-forming galaxies known. We
present images at several angular resolutions, ranging from ~40 to 4 arcsec.
These images show that SBS 0335-052 is a strongly interacting system, with a
faint diffuse HI bridge seen at low resolution, and elongated tails seen at the
higher resolutions. The overall morphology suggests that the pair represents a
major merger of extremely gas-rich galaxies. The low-resolution velocity field
is dominated by the velocity difference between the two galaxies and the
velocity gradient along the tidal features. However, for SBS 0335-052W at
least, at high angular resolution, one sees a central velocity field that could
be associated with the spin of the original undisturbed disc. The highest
angular resolution HI images show that the ionized superbubble, identified by
Thuan, Izotov & Lipovetsky (1997), in the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images
of SBS 0335-052E, is extended along one of the diffuse tidal features, and that
there is a high-density HI clump at the other end of the superbubble. The star
formation in SBS 0335-052E occurs mainly in a group of superstar clusters
(SSCs) with a clear age gradient; the age decreases as one approaches the dense
HI clump. We suggest that this propagating star formation is driven by the
superbubble expanding into a medium with a tidally-produced density gradient.
The high pressures associated with the compressed material would also naturally
explain why current star formation is mainly concentrated in superstar
clusters.

They reduce to classical la phi^4 theory when hbar -> 0. For hbar non-zero,

star forming region G09.62+0.20. This maser is one of a handful of periodically
flaring methanol masers. The 100-m Effelsberg telescope was used to monitor the
6.7 GHz methanol masers of G09.62+0.20. With the exception of a two week period
during the peak of the maser flare, we measure a constant magnetic field of
B_||~11+-2 mG in the two strongest maser components of G09.62+0.20 that are
separated by over 200 AU. In the two week period that coincides exactly with
the peak of the maser flare of the strongest maser feature, we measure a sharp
decrease and possible reversal of the Zeeman splitting. The exact cause of both
maser and polarization variability is still unclear, but it could be related to
either background amplification of polarized emission or the presence of a
massive protostar with a close-by companion. Alternatively, the polarization
variability could be caused by non-Zeeman effects related to the radiative
transfer of polarized maser emission.

correlated ferromagnetism is present only in samples with x > 0.25. In

measurement which is absent in optical and electrical measurements. We
demonstrate, by systematic electrical transport studies that carrier
localization indeed occurs below 20-50 K for samples with x < 0.2; however,
this does not lead to the formation of ferromagnetic phase in these samples
with an electron concentration in the range of 6 x 10(19) cm(-3) 1 x 10(20)
cm(-3). Detailed structural and optical transmission spectroscopy analyses
revealed that the anomalous Hall effect observed in samples with x > 0.25 is
due to the formation of secondary phases and Co clusters.

for the isotropic maser luminosity at a distance of 25 Mpc. Two new detections
are reported: a kilomaser with an isotropic luminosity L_H2O ~5 solar
luminosities in NGC3620 and a maser with about twice this luminosity in the
merger system NGC3256. The detections have been followed-up through continuum
and spectral line interferometric observations with the Australia Telescope
Compact Array (ATCA). In NGC3256, a fraction (about a third) of the maser

fluctuations. We point out that a process like reheating at the end of
inflation will inevitably generate perturbations, even on superhorizon scales,
by the local diffusion of energy. Provided that the reheating temperature is of
order the GUT scale, the density contrast $\delta_R$ for spheres of radius $R$
will be of order $10^{-5}$ at horizon entry, consistent with the values
measured by \texttt{WMAP}. If this were a purely classical process,
$\delta_R^2$ would fall as $1/R^4$ beyond the horizon, and the resulting
primordial density power spectrum would be $P(k) \propto k^n$ with $n=4$.
However, as shown by Gabrielli et al, a quantum diffusion process can generate
a power spectrum with any index in the range $0<n\leq 4$, including values
close to the observed $n=1$ ($\delta_R^2$ will then be $\propto 1/R^{3+n}$ for
$n<1$ and $1/R^4$ for $n>1$). Thus, the two characteristic parameters that
determine the appearance of present day structures could be natural
consequences of this mechanism. These are in any case the minimum density
variations that must have formed if the universe was rapidly heated to GUT
temperatures by the decay of a `false vacuum'. There is then no \emph{a priori}
necessity to postulate additional (and fine tuned) quantum fluctuations in the
`false vacuum', nor a pre-inflationary period. Given also the very stringent
pre-conditions required to trigger a satisfactory period of inflation,
altogether it seems at least as natural to assume that the universe began in a
flat and homogeneously expanding phase.

quantum, are not sources of curvature in the equations of motion derived from
the quantum effective action. This solves the first cosmological constant
problem, which is suppressing the enormous contributions to the cosmological
constant coming from quantum corrections. We discuss several forms of uniodular
gravity and put two of them, including one proposed by Henneaux and Teitelboim,
in constrained Hamiltonian form. The path integral is constructed from the
latter. Furthermore, the second cosmological constant problem, which is why the
measured value is so small, is also addressed by this theory. We argue that a

engineering. In this paper we revisit the classical and well-studied push
protocol for message broadcasting. Assuming that initially only one node has
some piece of information, at each stage every one of the informed nodes
chooses randomly and independently one of its neighbors and passes the message
to it.
  The performance of the push protocol on a fully connected network, where each
node is joined by a link to every other node, is very well understood. In
particular, Frieze and Grimmett proved that with probability 1-o(1) the push
protocol completes the broadcasting of the message within (1 +/- \epsilon)
(log_2 n + ln n) stages, where n is the number of nodes of the network.
However, there are no tight bounds for the broadcast time on networks that are
significantly sparser than the complete graph.
  In this work we consider random networks on n nodes, where every edge is
present with probability p, independently of every other edge. We show that if
p > f(n)ln n/ n, where f(n) is any function that tends to infinity as n grows,
then the push protocol broadcasts the message within (1 +/- \epsilon) (log_2 n
+ ln n) stages with probability 1-o(1). In other words, in almost every network
of density d such that d > f(n)ln n, the push protocol broadcasts a message as
fast as in a fully connected network. This is quite surprising in the sense
that the time needed remains essentially unaffected by the fact that most of

of Monte Carlo models, however, and in the present Letter we verify that
similar fluctuations occur in N-body models. The models were initialised by
generating initial conditions from the Monte Carlo model of NGC 6397 at the
simulated age of 12Gyr, and one was followed for 1Gyr. The new models help to
clarify the nature of the fluctuations, which have the nature of semi-regular
oscillations with a time scale of order 10^8yr. They are influenced by the
dynamical role which is played by primordial binaries in the evolution of the
core.

performed to a given confidence level, we focus on the angular distributions of
the Drell-Yan leptons, in particular we use as a basic observable an
angular-integrated center-edge asymmetry, A_{CE}. The spin of a heavy Z' gauge

confirmed to show short-period oscillations of the Beta Cep type and
simultaneous long-period pulsations typical of Slowly Pulsating B (SPB) stars.
  From the measured amplitude ratios in the Stromgren uvy passbands, the
stronger of the two short period pulsation modes was identified as radial; the
second is l=1. Three of the four SPB-type modes are most likely l=1 or 2.
Comparison with theoretical model calculations suggests that Gamma Peg is
either an 8.5 solar mass radial fundamental mode pulsator or a 9.6 solar mass
first radial overtone pulsator. HD 8801 was corroborated as a ""hybrid"" Delta
Sct Gamma Dor star; four pulsation modes of the Gamma Dor type were detected,
and two modes of the Delta Sct type were confirmed. Two pulsational signals
between the frequency domains of these two known classes of variables were
confirmed and another was newly detected. These are either previously unknown
types of pulsation, or do not originate from HD 8801. The O-type star HD 13745
showed small-amplitude slow variability on a time scale of 3.2 days. This
object may be related to the suspected new type of supergiant SPB stars, but a
rotational origin of its light variations cannot be ruled out at this point. 53
Psc is an SPB star for which two pulsation frequencies were determined and
identified with low spherical degree. The behaviour of 53 Ari and Iota Her is
consistent with non-variability during our observations, and we could not
confirm light variations of the comparison star 34 Psc previously suspected.

proven to converge towards a probabilistic mixture of i.i.d. Gaussian states

weak gravitational field of the Earth. For a free, real massless scalar field
subject to Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions on the parallel plates, the
resulting regularized and renormalized energy-momentum tensor is covariantly
conserved, while the trace anomaly vanishes if the massless field is
conformally coupled to gravity. Conformal coupling also ensures a finite
Casimir energy and finite values of the pressure upon parallel plates. These
results have been extended to an electromagnetic field subject to perfect
conductor (hence idealized) boundary conditions on parallel plates, by various
authors. The regularized and renormalized energy-momentum tensor has been
evaluated up to second order in the gravity acceleration. In both the scalar
and the electromagnetic case, studied to first order in the gravity
acceleration, the theory predicts a tiny force in the upwards direction acting
on the apparatus. This effect is conceptually very interesting, since it means
that Casimir energy is indeed expected to gravitate, although the magnitude of
the expected force makes it necessary to overcome very severe signal-modulation
problems.
