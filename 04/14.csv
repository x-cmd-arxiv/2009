non-supersymmetric abelian gauge theory on spin (non-spin) four-manifolds. For
any surface operator with a priori simultaneously non-vanishing parameters, we
explicitly show that the parameters transform naturally under an SL(2, Z) (or a
congruence subgroup thereof) duality of the theory. However, for
non-trivially-embedded surface operators, exact S-duality holds only if the
quantum parameter effectively vanishes, while the overall SL(2, Z) (or a
congruence subgroup thereof) duality holds up to a c-number at most,
regardless. Via the formalism of duality walls, we furnish an alternative
derivation of the transformation of parameters - found also to be consistent
with a switch from Wilson to 't Hooft loop operators under S-duality. With any
background embedding of surface operators, the partition function and the
correlation functions of non-singular, gauge-invariant local operators on any
curved four-manifold, are found to transform like modular forms under the
respective duality groups.

n-point functions of the conformal theory. We study inclusive processes and
argue that the inclusive production of unparticle stuff in standard model
processes due to the unparticle self-interactions can be decomposed using the
conformal partial wave expansion and its generalizations into a sum over
contributions from the production of various kinds of unparticle stuff,
corresponding to different primary conformal operators. Such processes
typically involve the production of unparticle stuff associated with operators
other than those to which the standard model couples directly. Thus just as
interactions between particles allow scattering processes to produce new
particles in the final state, so unparticle self-interactions cause the
production of various kinds of unparticle stuff. We discuss both inclusive and
exclusive methods for computing these processes. The resulting picture, we
believe, is a step towards understanding what unparticle stuff ""looks like""
because it is quite analogous to way we describe the production and scattering
of ordinary particles in quantum field theory, with the primary conformal
operators playing the role of particles and the coefficients in the conformal
partial wave expansion (and its generalization to include more fields) playing
the role of amplitudes. We exemplify our methods in the 2D toy model that we
discussed previously in which the Banks-Zaks theory is exactly solvable.

cosmic rays; our group previously showed that a cosmic-ray and thermally-driven
wind could explain soft X-ray emission towards the center of the Galaxy. In
this paper, we calculate the synchrotron emission from our original wind model
and compare it to observations; the synchrotron data shows that earlier
assumptions about the launching conditions of the wind must be changed: we are
required to improve that earlier model by restricting the launching region to
the domain of the inner ""Molecular Ring"", and by decreasing the magnetic field
strength from the previously assumed maximum strength. With these
physically-motived modifications, we find that a wind model can fit both the
radio synchrotron and the X-ray emission, although that model is required to
have a higher gas pressure and density than the previous model in order to
reproduce the observed X-ray emission measure within the smaller `footprint'.
The drop in magnetic field also decreases the effect of cosmic-ray heating,
requiring a higher temperature at the base of the wind than the previous model.

resolved into two giant regions of ~375 and 250pc diameter, respectively. The
ages of these two regions, estimated using Hb equivalent widths, suggest that
they are coeval events of ~5Myr with stellar masses of ~10^4M_o. We have also
used [OIII]/Hb and [SII]/Ha ratio maps to explore the excitation mechanisms in
this galaxy. The Ha emission line was used to measure the radial velocity and
velocity dispersion. We derived an integrated oxygen abundance of
12+log(O/H)=7.87 summing over all spaxels in our field of view. An average
value of 12+log(O/H)=7.77 and a difference of D(O/H)=0.47 between the minimum

points where the oxygen abundance was measured. The spatial distribution of
oxygen abundance does not show any significant gradient across the galaxy. On
the other hand, the bulk of data points are lying in a region of +-2sigma
dispersion (with sigma=0.1 dex) around the average value, confirming that this
compact HII galaxy as other previously studied dwarf irregular galaxies is
chemically homogeneous. Therefore, the new metals processed and injected by the

particle movement in which different types of motion, e.g. diffusion, ballistic
motion, and transient run-rest motion, can readily be distinguished in a single
graph, and compared with mathematical models. The FPP is attractive in that it
offers a means of reducing the data in the measured tracks, without making
assumptions about the mechanism of motion: for example, it does not employ
smoothing, segementation or arbitrary thresholds to discriminate between
different types of motion in a particle track. Taking experimental data from
tracked endocytic vesicles, and calculating the FPP, we see how three molecular
treatments affect the trafficking. We show the FPP can quantify complicated

Two plasma instabilities - the beam-beam instability and the coherent
synchrotron radiation instability - are analyzed. The former severely limits
the achievable luminosity in storage rings and is related to the two-stream
instability which has been proposed as a candidate for the radiation mechanism
of radio pulsars. The main emphasis is on coherent synchrotron radiation which
can lead to prohibitive energy losses in bunch compressors. Coherent
synchrotron radiation also makes up the intense emission of radio waves by
pulsars. Simple models based on the linearized Vlasov equation and relativistic

reliable characterisation of its basic properties. Having resolved most of the
cosmic XRB into discrete sources, the levels and spectral shapes of its main
components can be used to probe both the source populations and also
alternative cosmological and large-scale structure models. Recent observations
of clusters seem to provide evidence that clusters formed earlier and are more
abundant than predicted in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. This motivates
interest in alternative models that predict enhanced power on cluster scales.
We calculate predicted levels and spectra of the superposed emission from
groups and clusters of galaxies in $\Lambda$CDM and in two viable alternative
non-Gaussian ($\chi^2$) and early dark energy models. The predicted levels of
the contribution of clusters to the XRB in the non-Gaussian models exceed the
measured level at low energies and levels of the residual XRB in the 2-8 keV
band; these particular models are essentially ruled out. Our work demonstrates
the diagnostic value of the integrated X-ray emission from clusters, by
considering also its dependences on different metallicities, gas and
temperature profiles, Galactic absorption, merger scenarios, and on a
non-thermal pressure component. We also show that the XRB can be used for a
upper limit for the concentration parameter value.

simulations of Coulomb solids representing the crust, we show that the breaking
strain of pure single crystals is very large and that impurities, defects, and
grain boundaries only modestly reduce the breaking strain to around 0.1. Due to
the collective behavior of the ions during failure found in our simulations,
the neutron star crust is likely very strong and can support mountains large
enough so that their gravitational wave radiation could limit the spin periods
of some stars and might be detectable in large scale interferometers.
Furthermore, our microscopic modeling of neutron star crust material can help
analyze mechanisms relevant in magnetar giant and micro flares.

between two distant parties by wisely exploiting properties of quantum
mechanics. In QKD, experimental measurements on quantum states are transformed
to a secret key and this has to be done in accordance with a security proof.
Unfortunately, many theoretical proofs are not readily implementable in
experiments and do not consider all practical issues. Therefore, in order to
bridge this ""practical gap"", we integrate a few existing theoretical results
together with new developments, in effect producing a simple and complete
recipe for classical post-processing that one can follow to derive a secret key
from the measurement outcomes in an actual QKD experiment. This integration is
non-trivial and our consideration is both practical and comprehensive in the
sense that we take into account the finiteness of the key length and consider
the effects on security of several essential primitives (including
authentication, error handling, and privacy amplification). Furthermore, we
quantify the security of the final secret key that is universally composable.
We show that the finite-size effect mainly comes from phase error estimation.
Our result is applicable to the BB84 protocol with a single or entangled photon
source.

which the HVC is exposed to a wind of constant density and velocity. In the
second set of models we follow the trajectory of the HVC on its way through an
isothermal hydrostatic halo towards the disk. Thus, we cover the two extremes
of possible HVC trajectories. The resulting cloud morphologies exhibit a
pronounced head-tail structure, with a leading dense cold core and a warm
diffuse tail. Morphologies and velocity differences between head and tail are
consistent with observations. For typical cloud velocities and halo densities,
clouds with H{\small{I}} masses $< 10^{4.5}$ M$_\odot$ will lose their
H{\small{I}} content within 10 kpc or less. Their remnants may contribute to a
population of warm ionized gas clouds in the hot coronal gas, and they may
eventually be integrated in the warm ionized Galactic disk. Some of the (still
over-dense, but now slow) material might recool, forming intermediate or low
velocity clouds close to the Galactic disk. Given our simulation parameters and
the limitation set by numerical resolution, we argue that the derived

distinguishing capabilities of classical data: in contrast with quantum data,
classical data can be copied and deleted. The algebraic approach thus shifts
the paradigm of ""quantization"" of a classical theory to ""classicization"" of a

conceptual shift, but even allows us to distinguish the deterministic classical

Galactic potential, gaseous halo, Galactic disk, velocities of dwarf galaxies,
and effects of drag on stripped gas in the halo, we model the distribution of

radial distribution of the accretion of gas that cools directly out of the halo

difference is largely due to the discrepancy in absolute specific angular

turbulent molecular cloud. We compare the distribution of stellar masses,
accretion rates, and temperatures in the cases with and without radiative
transfer, and we demonstrate that radiative feedback has a profound effect on
accretion, multiplicity, and mass by reducing the number of stars formed and
the total rate at which gas turns into stars. We also show, that once star
formation reaches a steady state, protostellar radiation is by far the dominant
source of energy in the simulation, exceeding viscous dissipation and
compressional heating by at least an order of magnitude. Calculations that omit
radiative feedback from protstars significantly underestimate the gas
temperature and the strength of this effect. Although heating from protostars
is mainly confined to the protostellar cores, we find that it is sufficient to
suppress disk fragmentation that would otherwise result in very low-mass
companions or brown dwarfs. We demonstrate that the mean protostellar accretion

ingredient in the evolution of baryonic structures. However, it has long been
known that strong radio AGN also exist in ""noncool core"" clusters, which brings
up the question whether an X-ray cool core is always required for radio
feedback. In this work, we present a systematic analysis of BCGs and strong
radio AGN in 152 groups and clusters from the Chandra archive. All 69 BCGs with
radio AGN more luminous than 2x10^23 W Hz^-1 at 1.4 GHz are found to have X-ray
cool cores. The BCG cool cores can be divided into two classes, the
large-cool-core (LCC) class and the corona class. Small coronae, easily
overlooked at z>0.1, can trigger strong heating episodes in groups and
clusters, long before large cool cores are formed. Strong radio outbursts
triggered by coronae may destroy embryonic large cool cores and thus provide
another mechanism to prevent formation of large cool cores. However, it is
unclear whether coronae are decoupled from the radio feedback cycles as they
have to be largely immune to strong radio outbursts. Our sample study also
shows the absence of groups with a luminous cool core while hosting a strong
radio AGN, which is not observed in clusters. This points to a greater impact
of radio heating on low-mass systems than clusters. As examples of the corona
class, we also present detailed analyses of a BCG corona associated with a
strong radio AGN (ESO 137-006 in A3627) and one of the faintest coronae known

However, there are network scenarios where the applicability of such models is

highlighted and discussed, all fundamentally connected to the Lorentz force.
First the coupling of the convecting and overshooting fluid in the surface
layers of the Sun with the magnetic field. Here, the plasma motion provides the
dominant force, which shapes the magnetic field and drives the surface dynamo.
Progress in the understanding of the horizontal magnetic field is summarized
and discussed. Second, the coupling between acoustic waves and the magnetic
field, in particular the phenomenon of wave conversion and wave refraction. It
is described how measurements of wave travel times in the atmosphere can
provide information about the topography of the wave conversion zone, i.e., the
surface of equal Alfv\'en and sound speed. In quiet regions, this surface
separates a highly dynamic magnetic field with fast moving magnetosonic waves
and shocks around and above it from the more slowly evolving field of high-beta
plasma below it. Third, the magnetic field also couples to the radiation field,
which leads to radiative flux channeling and increased anisotropy in the
radiation field. It is shown how faculae can be understood in terms of this
effect. The article starts with an introduction to the magnetic field of the
quiet Sun in the light of new results from the Hinode space observatory and
with a brief survey of measurements of the turbulent magnetic field with the
help of the Hanle effect.

third party can later quickly recover a (1 +/- eps)-approximation to ||x-y||_1

is due to [Feigenbaum et al., SICOMP 2002], which achieved the optimal sketch
length of O(eps^{-2}log(nM)) bits but had a running time of O(n*log(nM)/eps^2).
Notice that our running time is near-linear for every eps, whereas for
sufficiently small values of eps, the running time of the previous algorithm
can be as large as quadratic. Like their algorithm, our sketching procedure

difficult to find always available global common control channels. This puts a
significant challenge on the network design. We develop the control cloud based

binary C-type asteroid 121 Hermione, performed during its 2007 opposition. We
took advantage of the rare observational opportunity afforded by one of the
annual equinoxes of Hermione occurring close to its opposition in June 2007.
The equinox provides an edge-on aspect for an Earth-based observer, which is
well suited to a thorough study of Hermione's physical characteristics. The
catalog of observations carried out with small telescopes is presented in this
work, together with new adaptive optics (AO) imaging obtained between 2005 and
2008 with the Yepun 8-m VLT telescope and the 10-m Keck telescope. The most
striking result is confirmation that Hermione is a bifurcated and elongated
body, as suggested by Marchis et al., (2005). A new effective diameter of 187
+/- 6 km was calculated from the combination of AO, photometric and thermal
observations. The new diameter is some 10% smaller than the hitherto accepted
radiometric diameter based on IRAS data. The reason for the discrepancy is that
IRAS viewed the system almost pole-on. New thermal observations with the
Spitzer Space Telescope agree with the diameter derived from AO and lightcurve
observations. On the basis of the new AO astrometric observations of the small
32-km diameter satellite we have refined the orbit solution and derived a new
value of the bulk density of Hermione of 1.4 +0.5/-0.2 g cm-3. We infer a
macroscopic porosity of ~33 +5/-20%.

For the first time, the differential cross sections were measured at low

sections from protons and neutrons was observed at backward K$^{+/0}$ angles.
This suggests the importance of the contact term, which coexists with t-channel
K exchange under gauge invariance. This interpretation was compatible with the
differential cross sections, decay asymmetry, and photon beam asymmetry
measured in the production from protons at forward K$^+$ angles.

also a manifestation of strong electron-lattice interaction. One can propose an

form factors for the vector and axialvector currents: the vector, induced

carried out with the gauge configurations generated with N_f=2+1 dynamical
domain wall fermions and Iwasaki gauge actions at beta = 2.13, corresponding to
a cutoff 1/a = 1.73 GeV, and a spatial volume of (2.7 fm)^3. The up and down
quark masses are varied so the pion mass lies between 0.33 and 0.67 GeV while
the strange quark mass is about 12% heavier than the physical one. We calculate
the form factors in the range of momentum transfers, 0.2 < q^2 < 0.75 GeV^2.
The vector and induced tensor form factors are well described by the
conventional dipole forms and result in significant underestimation of the
Dirac and Pauli mean-squared radii and the anomalous magnetic moment compared
to the respective experimental values. We show that the axialvector form factor
is significantly affected by the finite spatial volume of the lattice. In
particular in the axial charge, g_A/g_V, the finite volume effect scales with a
single dimensionless quantity, m_pi L, the product of the calculated pion mass
and the spatial lattice extent. Our results indicate that for this quantity,
m_pi L > 6 is required to ensure that finite volume effects are below 1%.

toroidal magnetic fields with four kinds of realistic equations of state (EOSs)
of SLy (Douchin et al.), FPS (Pandharipande et al.), Shen (Shen et al.), and LS
(Lattimer & Swesty). We numerically construct thousands of equilibrium
configurations. Particularly we pay attention to the equilibrium sequences of
constant baryon mass and/or constant magnetic flux, which model evolutions of
an isolated neutron star. Important properties obtained in this study are
summarized as follows ; (1) The dependence of the mass-shedding angular
velocity on the EOSs is determined from that of the non-magnetized case. The
stars with Shen(FPS) EOS reach the mass-shedding limit at the smallest(largest)
angular velocity, while the stars with SLy or Lattimer-Swesty EOSs take the
moderate values. (2) For the supramassive sequences, the equilibrium
configurations are found to be generally oblate for the realistic EOSs in sharp
contrast to the polytropic stars. For FPS(LS) EOS, the parameter region which
permits the prolately deformed stars is widest(narrowest). For SLy and Shen
EOS, it is in medium. Furthermore, the angular velocities $\Omega_{\rm up}$,
above which the stars start to spin up as they lose angular momentum, are found
to depend sharply on the realistic EOSs. Our analysis indicates that the
hierarchy of this spin up angular velocity is $\Omega_{\rm up,SLy} >
\Omega_{\rm up,FPS} > \Omega_{\rm up,LS}>\Omega_{\rm up,Shen}$ and this
relation holds even if the sequences have strong magnetic fields. Our results
suggest the EOSs within the relativistic stars containing purely toroidal
magnetic fields can be constrained by observing the angular velocity, the
gravitational wave, and the signature of the spin up.

weighted multiple majority game (C-WMMG for short). C-WMMG models a basic
cooperation rule, the complementary cooperation rule, and can be taken as a
sister model of the famous weighted majority game (WMG for short). In this
paper, we concentrate on the two dimensional C-WMMG. An interesting property of
this case is that there are at most $n+1$ minimal winning coalitions (MWC for
short), and they can be enumerated in time $O(n\log n)$, where $n$ is the
number of players. This property guarantees that the two dimensional C-WMMG is
more handleable than WMG. In particular, we prove that the main power indices,
i.e. the Shapley-Shubik index, the Penrose-Banzhaf index, the Holler-Packel
index, and the Deegan-Packel index, are all polynomially computable. To make a
comparison with WMG, we know that it may have exponentially many MWCs, and none
of the four power indices is polynomially computable (unless P=NP). Still for
the two dimensional case, we show that local monotonicity holds for all of the
four power indices. In WMG, this property is possessed by the Shapley-Shubik
index and the Penrose-Banzhaf index, but not by the Holler-Packel index or the
Deegan-Packel index. Since our model fits very well the cooperation and
competition in team sports, we hope that it can be potentially applied in
measuring the values of players in team sports, say help people give more
objective ranking of NBA players and select MVPs, and consequently bring new
insights into contest theory and the more general field of sports economics. It
may also provide some interesting enlightenments into the design of
non-additive voting mechanisms. Last but not least, the threshold version of
C-WMMG is a generalization of WMG, and natural variants of it are closely
related with the famous airport game and the stable marriage/roommates problem.

particle loss. A consistent formalism which incorporates the evolution of
sub-systems with a reduced number of particles is constructed through the
Lindblad equation. Specifically, the transition from an $N$-particle system to
an $(N-1)$-particle system due to a complex absorbing potential is achieved by
relating the Lindblad operators to annihilation operators. The method allows
for a straight forward interpretation of how many constituent particles have
left the system after interaction. We illustrate the formalism using
one-dimensional two-particle model problems.

  a new facet of Lagrangian formalism for relativistic dynamics","26 pages",,,,"physics.class-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Introspection into the classical and quantum mechanical analyses reveals that
the essential consideration for seamlessly bridging the two is to optimize the
relaxation loss in the field-particle interaction on classically defined
stationary action paths. This study thus points out that the Lagrangian
dynamics though considers stationary action ignores the optimum power loss
criterion in the interactive negotiation for the dynamic passage. Taking the
radiation loss optimization as the additional criterion in the accelerated
motion of a charged particle it is shown that the dynamics is necessarily
executed by a family of nonlocally entangled paths. In the coherent
entanglement the paths unitarily evolves in space-time conserving the instant
energy and momentum integrally over the volume. The evolution dictates
quantized energy and momentum, and defines the rationale behind decoherence
with radiation relaxation. Under the sustained interaction the nonlocal field
incessantly attempt defending the unitary evolutions at the cost of the
relaxation loss from the external field. The nonlocally mediated
electrodynamics is free of issues like acceleration runaway in the decohered
interaction of moving charge with external field, where relaxation occurs both
in ordered (Larmor radiation) and disordered (thermal radiation) forms, the
latter generally being insignificant in proportion. The thermal relaxation rate
is shown to be akin to that in Hawking-Unruh radiations. The classically
derived formulation proves its versatility in revealing all the nonlocal
characteristics of the micro-world and more. It reveals the nonlocal interplay
in setting the signal speed limit, the nonlocal entanglement limit and the
disentanglement mechanism. It provides the estimates of macroscopic and cosmic
phenomena.

surfaces in contact with aqueous solutions are almost equally stable, despite
the evident needlelike shape of goethite crystals indicating substantially
different reactivity of the two faces. We thus suggest that crystal anisotropy
may result from different growth rates due to virtually barrierless adsorption
of hydrated ions on the (021) but not on the (110) surface. No clear evidence
is found for spontaneous electron transfer from an adsorbed Fe(II) hex-aqua
complex to a defect-free goethite substrate. Crystal defects are thus inferred
to play an important role in assisting such electron transfer processes
observed in a recent experimental study. Finally, goethite surfaces are
observed to enhance the partial oxidation of adsorbed aqueous Fe(II) upon
reaction with molecular oxygen. We propose that this catalytic oxidation effect
arises from donation of electronic charge from the bulk oxide to the oxidizing
agent through shared hydroxyl ligands anchoring the Fe(II) complexes on the
surface.

ratio. We evaluate persistent currents, position and statistical behavior of
flux-induced vortices and lifetime of metastable fluxoid states. The influence
of nonuniformity on the persistent current does not depend strongly on the
details of the cross-section profile; it depends mainly on its first harmonic,
but not only on it. As a consequence of nonuniformity the maximum of the
persistent current shifts to smaller fluxes and the passage between fluxoid
states remains non-hysteretic down to lower temperatures than in the case of a
uniform sample. Our results using TDGL agree remarkably well with recent
measurements of the persistent current in superconducting rings and with
measurements of the position of a vortex that mediates between fluxoid states
in an asymmetric disk with a hole; they could also provide a plausible
explanation for unexpectedly short measured lifetimes of metastable states.
Comparison between TDGL and KWT indicates that they lead to the same results
for the persistent current, whereas KWT leads to larger lifetimes than TDGL.

during implantation, but to a Mn reaction produced after a short thermal

070502 (2009)] where we introduced a scheme for fault-tolerant holonomic
quantum computation (HQC) on stabilizer codes. HQC is an all-geometric strategy
based on non-Abelian adiabatic holonomies, which is known to be robust against
various types of errors in the control parameters. The scheme we present shows
that HQC is a scalable method of computation, and opens the possibility for
combining the benefits of error correction with the inherent resilience of the
holonomic approach. We show that with the Bacon-Shor code the scheme can be
implemented using Hamiltonian operators of weight 2 and 3.

completely different perspective, we introduce instead a universal scheme that
guarantees variance reductions in all Metropolis--Hastings-based estimators
while keeping the computation cost under control. We establish a central limit
theorem for the improved estimators and illustrate their performances on toy
examples and on a probit model estimation.

where the Casimir constraints are replaced by the specification of a prior
vorticity distribution. A phenomenological relaxation equation is obtained for
the evolution of the coarse-grained vorticity. This equation monotonically
increases a generalized entropic functional (determined by the prior) while
conserving circulation and energy. It can be used as a thermodynamical
parametrization of forced 2D turbulence, or as a numerical algorithm to
construct (i) arbitrary statistical equilibrium states in the sense of
Ellis-Haven-Turkington (ii) particular statistical equilibrium states in the
sense of Miller-Robert-Sommeria (iii) arbitrary stationary solutions of the 2D
Euler equation that are formally nonlinearly dynamically stable according to

Expanded derivation",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The zero-temperature Casimir-Lifshitz force between two plates moving
parallel to each other at arbitrary constant speed was found in [New J. Phys.
11, 033035 (2009)]. The solution is here generalized to the case where the
plates are at different temperatures. The Casimir-Lifshitz force is obtained by
calculating the electromagnetic stress tensor, using the method employed by
Antezza et al. [Phys. Rev. A 77, 022901 (2008)] for non-moving plates at
different temperatures. The perpendicular force on the plates has contributions
from the quantum vacuum and from the thermal radiation; both of these
contributions are influenced by the motion. In addition to the perpendicular
force, thermal radiation from the moving plates gives rise to a lateral
component of the Casimir-Lifshitz force, an effect with no quantum-vacuum
contribution. The zero-temperature results are reproduced, in particular the
non-existence of a quantum-vacuum friction between the plates.

with a negative cosmological constant and construct numerically non uniform
black strings solutions. Our results suggest the existence of a localised black
hole in asymptotically locally $AdS$ spacetime. We also present evidences for a
dependence of the critical dimension on the horizon radius.The critical
dimension represents the dimension where the order of the phase transition
between uniform and non uniform black string changes. Finally, we argue that
both, the regular asymptotically locally $AdS$ solution and $AdS$ black string
solutions with a very small horizon radius, present a negative tension. This
turns out to be an unexpected feature of the solutions.
