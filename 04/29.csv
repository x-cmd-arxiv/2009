Given a set of commuting Killing vector fields of the space-time the domain
structure lives on the submanifold where at least one of the Killing vector
fields have zero norm. Depending on which Killing vector field has zero norm
the submanifold is naturally divided into domains. A domain corresponds either
to a set of fixed points of a spatial symmetry or to a Killing horizon,
depending on whether the characterizing Killing vector field is space-like or
time-like near the domain. The domain structure provides invariants of the
space-time, both topological and geometrical. It is defined for any space-time
dimension and any number of commuting Killing vector fields. We examine the
domain structure for asymptotically flat space-times and find a canonical form
for the metric of such space-times. The domain structure generalizes the rod
structure introduced for space-times with D-2 commuting Killing vector fields.
We analyze in detail the domain structure for Minkowski space, the
Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole and the Myers-Perry black hole in six and
seven dimensions. Finally we consider the possible domain structures for
asymptotically flat black holes in six and seven dimensions.

surface states in semiconductors has attracted much attention in recent times,
mostly in the context of solid-state quantum computer architecture. A recent
transport spectroscopy experiment for the first time was able to probe the
Stark shifted spectrum of a single donor in silicon buried close to a gate.
Here we present the full theoretical model involving large-scale quantum
mechanical simulations that was used to compute the Stark shifted donor states
in order to interpret the experimental data. Use of atomistic tight-binding
technique on a domain of over a million atoms helped not only to incorporate
the full band structure of the host, but also to treat realistic device
geometries and donor models, and to use a large enough basis set to capture any
number of donor states. The method yields a quantitative description of the
symmetry transition that the donor electron undergoes from a 3D Coulomb
confined state to a 2D surface state as the electric field is ramped up
adiabatically. In the intermediate field regime, the electron resides in a
superposition between the states of the atomic donor potential and that of the
quantum dot like states at the surface. In addition to determining the effect
of field and donor depth on the electronic structure, the model also provides a
basis to distinguish between a phosphorus and an arsenic donor based on their
Stark signature. The method also captures valley-orbit splitting in both the
donor well and the interface well, a quantity critical to silicon qubits. The
work concludes with a detailed analysis of the effects of screening on the
donor spectrum.

described by inequalities equivalent to a complete set of uncertainty relations
for the quantum domain and to nonnegativity of probability density on phase

mathematical mechanism which allows to construct different kinds of tomographic

consisting of a superposition of photons and excitons. Due to the photon
component, polaritons are characterized by a quantum coherence length in the
several micron range. Owing to their exciton content, they display sizeable
interactions, both mutual and with other electronic degrees of freedom. These
unique features have produced striking matter wave phenomena, such as
Bose-Einstein condensation, or parametric processes able to generate quantum
entangled polariton states. Recently, several paradigms for spatial confinement
of polaritons in semiconductor devices have been established. This opens the
way to quantum devices in which polaritons can be used as a vector of quantum
information. An essential element of each quantum device is the quantum state
control. Here we demonstrate control of the wave function of confined
polaritons, by means of tailored resonant optical excitation. By tuning the
energy and momentum of the laser, we achieve precise control of the momentum
pattern of the polariton wave function. A theoretical model supports
unambiguously our observations.

is well established. It has been tentatively explained by the possible increase
of planet formation probability in stellar disks with enhanced amount of
metals. However, there are two caveats to this explanation. First, giant stars
with planets do not show a metallicity distribution skewed towards metal-rich
objects, as found for dwarfs. Second, the correlation with metallicity is not
valid at intermediate metallicities, for which it can be shown that giant
planets are preferentially found orbiting thick disk stars.
  None of these two peculiarities is explained by the proposed scenarios of
giant planet formation. We contend that they are galactic in nature, and
probably not linked to the formation process of giant planets. It is suggested
that the same dynamical effect, namely the migration of stars in the galactic
disk, is at the origin of both features, with the important consequence that
most metal-rich stars hosting giant planets originate from the inner disk, a
property that has been largely neglected until now. We illustrate that a
planet-metallicity correlation similar to the observed one is easily obtained
if stars from the inner disk have a higher percentage of giant planets than
stars born at the solar radius, with no specific dependence on metallicity. We
propose that the density of molecular hydrogen in the inner galactic disk (the
molecular ring) could play a role in setting the high percentage of giant
planets that originate from this region.

function of bias, we find initially an increase of the differential
conductivity, which we attribute to self-heating. At higher bias, the
conductivity saturates and even decreases due to backscattering from optical
phonons. The electron-phonon interactions are also responsible for the decay of
the Fano factor at bias voltages $V>0.1$ V. The high bias electronic
temperature has been calculated from shot noise measurements, and it goes up to
$\sim1200$ K at $V=0.75$ V. Using the theoretical temperature dependence of BLG
conductivity, we extract an effective electron-optical phonon scattering time
$\tau_{e-op}$. In a 230 nm long BLG sample of mobility $\mu=3600$

properties of these aggregates, such as the peculiar geometric scaling of their
energy spectrum, are universal, i.e. independent of the microscopic details of

Efimov trimer states still eludes observation. Here we report on the discovery
of two bound trimer states of potassium atoms very close to the Efimov

cosmological models without an inflationary phase in the classical expanding
era because the typical size of the Universe after leaving the quantum regime
should be around the Planck length, and the standard decelerated classical
expansion after that is not sufficient to enlarge the Universe in the time
available. For instance, in many quantum minisuperspace bouncing models studied
in the literature, solutions where the Universe leave the quantum regime in the
expanding phase with appropriate size have negligible probability amplitude
with respect to solutions leaving this regime around the Planck length. In this
paper, I present a general class of moving gaussian solutions of the
Wheeler-DeWitt equation where the velocity of the wave in minisuperspace along
the scale factor axis, which is the new large parameter introduced in order to
circumvent the abovementioned problem, induces a large acceleration around the
quantum bounce, forcing the Universe to leave the quantum regime sufficiently
big to increase afterwards to the present size, without needing any classical
inflationary phase in between, and with reasonable relative probability
amplitudes with respect to models leaving the quantum regime around the Planck
scale. Furthermore, linear perturbations around this background model are free

  Aims: In preparation for the GTC, our goal is to build a catalogue of massive
star candidates in the metal-poor irregular galaxy IC1613 with high astrometric
accuracy, apt for the current generation of multi-object spectrographs. A
census of OB associations in this galaxy is also needed, to provide important
additional information about age and environment of the candidate OB stars.
  Methods: From INT-WFC observations, we have built an astrometric and
photometric catalogue of stars in IC1613. Candidate blue massive stars are
preselected from their colors. A friends-of-friends algorithm is developed to
find their clustering in the galaxy. While a common physical origin for all the
members of the associations cannot be ensured, this is a necessary first step
to place candidate OB stars in a population context.
  Results: We have produced a deep catalogue of targets in IC1613 that covers a
large field of view. To achieve high astrometric accuracy a new astrometric
procedure is developed for the INT-WFC data. We have also built a catalogue of
OB associations in IC1613. We have found that they concentrate in the central
regions, specially in the HII bubbles. The study of extinction confirms that it
is patchy, with local values of color-excess above the foreground value.

isolated dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSph) Cetus and Tucana. Based on Hubble
Space Telescope images obtained with the Advanced Camera for Surveys in the
F475W and F814W bands, we identified 180 and 371 variables in Cetus and Tucana,
respectively. The vast majority are RR Lyrae stars. In Cetus we also found
three anomalous Cepheids, four candidate binaries and one candidate long-period
variable (LPV), while six anomalous Cepheids and seven LPV candidates were
found in Tucana. Of the RR Lyrae stars, 147 were identified as fundamental mode
(RRab) and only eight as first-overtone mode (RRc) in Cetus, with mean periods
of 0.614 and 0.363 day, respectively. In Tucana we found 216 RRab and 82 RRc
giving mean periods of 0.604 and 0.353 day. These values place both galaxies in
the so-called Oosterhoff Gap, as is generally the case for dSph. We calculated
the distance modulus to both galaxies using different approaches based on the
properties of RRab and RRc, namely the luminosity-metallicity and
period-luminosity-metallicity relations, and found values in excellent
agreement with previous estimates using independent methods:
(m-M)_{0,Cet}=24.46+-0.12 and (m-M)_{0,Tuc}=24.74+-0.12, corresponding to
780+-40 kpc and 890+-50 kpc. We also found numerous RR Lyrae variables
pulsating in both modes simultaneously (RRd): 17 in Cetus and 60 in Tucana.
Tucana is, after Fornax, the second dSph in which such a large fraction of RRd
(~17%) has been observed. We provide the photometry and pulsation parameters
for all the variables, and compare the latter with values from the literature
for well-studied dSph of the Local Group and Galactic globular clusters.

redundancy for infinite frames has proven elusive. Though quantitative
candidates for redundancy exist, the main open problem is whether a frame with
redundancy greater than one contains a subframe with redundancy arbitrarily
close to one. We will answer this question in the affirmative for
$\ell^1$-localized frames. We then specialize our results to Gabor multi-frames
with generators in $M^1(\R^d)$, and Gabor molecules with envelopes in
$W(C,l^1)$. As a main tool in this work, we show there is a universal function
$g(x)$ so that for every $\epsilon>0$, every Parseval frame $\{f_i\}_{i=1}^M$
for an $N$-dimensional Hilbert space $H_N$ has a subset of fewer than
$(1+\epsilon)N$ elements which is a frame for $H_N$ with lower frame bound
$g(\epsilon/(2\frac{M}{N}-1))$. This work provides the first meaningful
quantative notion of redundancy for a large class of infinite frames. In
addition, the results give compelling new evidence in support of a general

the C$_{2v}$ $\tilde{\Delta}_1$ band has a much smaller imaginary k component

sample at high redshift with total infrared luminosity measured directly from
FIR and millimeter photometry, and as such gives us the first accurate view of

starburst sample is the highest ever seen, some three times higher than in
local starbursts, whereas in AGNs this ratio is depressed below the starburst
trend, often severely. Several pieces of evidence imply that AGNs exist in this

extended distribution of PAH molecules. Such an extended distribution prevents
further destruction PAH molecules by central AGNs. We conclude that objects in

single MBH. Our numerical scattering experiments reveal that: 1) a significant
fraction of stars initially bound to the primary hole are scattered into its
tidal disruption loss cone by gravitational interactions with the secondary
hole, an enhancement effect that is more pronounced for very unequal-mass
binaries; 2) about 25% (40%) of all strongly interacting stars are tidally
disrupted by a MBH binary of mass ratio q=1/81 (q=1/243) and eccentricity 0.1;
and 3) two mechanisms dominate the fueling of the tidal disruption loss cone, a
Kozai non-resonant interaction that causes the secular evolution of the stellar
angular momentum in the field of the binary, and the effect of close encounters
with the secondary hole that change the stellar orbital parameters in a chaotic
way. For a hard MBH binary of 10^7 solar masses and mass ratio 0.01, embedded
in an isothermal stellar cusp of velocity dispersion sigma*=100 km/s, the tidal
disruption rate can be as large as 1/yr. This is 4 orders of magnitude higher

curved background around a charged, rotating cosmic string, surrounded by
gravitational and electromagnetic waves, under the influence of the Kerr-NUT

the null direction and preserving its profile. In this case, the absence of the
k-parameter from the C-energy implies that, away from the linear defect the
electromagnetic field is too weak to contribute to the energy-content of the
cylindrically-symmetric space-time under consideration. In order to explain
this result, we have evaluated the Weyl and the Maxwell scalars near the axis
of the linear defect and at the spatial infinity. Accordingly, we have found
that the electromagnetic field is concentrated (mainly) in the vicinity of the

descends both from string theory and loop quantum gravity, and that corrects
the Einstein-Hilbert action by adding the product of a scalar field and the
parity-violating, Pontryagin density. In this theory, the gravitational field
of spinning black holes is described by a modified Kerr geometry whose
multipole moments deviate from the Kerr ones only at the fourth multipole, l =
4. We investigate possible signatures of this theory in the gravitational wave
emission produced in the inspiral of stellar compact objects into massive black
holes, both for intermediate- and extreme-mass ratios. We use the
semi-relativistic approximation, where the trajectories are geodesics of the
massive black hole geometry and the gravitational waveforms are obtained from a
multipolar decomposition of the radiative field. The main CS corrections to the
waveforms arise from modifications to the geodesic trajectories, due to changes
to the massive black hole geometry, and manifest themselves as an accumulating
dephasing relative to the general relativistic case. We also explore the
propagation and the stress-energy tensor of gravitational waves in this theory.
We find that, although this tensor has the same form as in General Relativity,
the energy and angular momentum balance laws are indeed modified through the
stress-energy tensor of the CS scalar field. These balance laws could be used
to describe the inspiral through adiabatic changes in the orbital parameters,
which in turn would enhance the dephasing effect. Gravitational-wave
observations of intermediate- or extreme-mass ratio inspirals with advanced
ground detectors or with LISA could use such dephasing to test the dynamical
theory to unprecedented levels.

fields and stellar feedback. In this simulation, the velocity dispersions at
all scales are caused primarily by infall motions rather than by random
turbulence. We study the properties (density, total gas+stars mass, stellar
mass, velocity dispersion, and star formation rate) of the cloud hosting the
first local, isolated ""star formation"" event in the simulation and compare them
with those of the cloud formed by a later central, global collapse event. We
suggest that the small-scale, isolated collapse may be representative of low-
to intermediate-mass star-forming regions, while the large-scale, massive one
may be representative of massive star forming regions. We also find that the
statistical distributions of physical properties of the dense cores in the
region of massive collapse compare very well with those from a recent survey of
the massive star forming region in the Cygnus X molecular cloud. The star
formation efficiency per free-fall time (SFE_ff) of the high-mass SF clump is
low, ~0.04. This occurs because the clump is accreting mass at a high rate, not
because its specific SFR (SSFR) is low. This implies that a low value of the
SFE_ff does not necessarily imply a low SSFR, but may rather indicate a large
gas accretion rate. We suggest that a globally low SSFR at the GMC level can be
attained even if local star forming sites have much larger values of the SSFR
if star formation is a spatially intermittent process, so that most of the mass
in a GMC is not participating of the SF process at any given time.

Walley, in which beliefs are represented through sets of probability
distributions, and we focus on the problem of modeling prior ignorance about a
categorical random variable. In this setting, it is a known result that a state
of prior ignorance is not compatible with learning. To overcome this problem,
another state of beliefs, called \emph{near-ignorance}, has been proposed.
Near-ignorance resembles ignorance very closely, by satisfying some principles
that can arguably be regarded as necessary in a state of ignorance, and allows
learning to take place. What this paper does, is to provide new and substantial
evidence that also near-ignorance cannot be really regarded as a way out of the
problem of starting statistical inference in conditions of very weak beliefs.
The key to this result is focusing on a setting characterized by a variable of
interest that is \emph{latent}. We argue that such a setting is by far the most
common case in practice, and we provide, for the case of categorical latent
variables (and general \emph{manifest} variables) a condition that, if
satisfied, prevents learning to take place under prior near-ignorance. This
condition is shown to be easily satisfied even in the most common statistical
problems. We regard these results as a strong form of evidence against the
possibility to adopt a condition of prior near-ignorance in real statistical
problems.

agreement with recent experimental findings. The signatures of tunneling that
we observe are a narrowed distribution in the low-to-intermediate momentum
region, with a tail that extends to match the result of the covalently bonded
state. The transition to tunneling behavior shows similarity to features
observed in recent experiments performed on confined water. We corroborate our

mechanical model to describe dust aggregate collisions with macroscopic
parameters like tensile strength, compressive strength and shear strength. For
one well defined dust sample material, the tensile and compressive strength
were measured in a static experiment and implemented in a Smoothed Particle
Hydrodynamics (SPH) code. A laboratory experiment was designed to compare the
laboratory results with the results of the SPH simulation. In this experiment,
a mm-sized glass bead is dropped into a cm-sized dust aggregate with the
previously measured strength parameters. We determine the deceleration of the
glass bead by high-speed imaging and the compression of the dust aggregate by
x-ray micro-tomography. The measured penetration depth, stopping time and
compaction under the glass bead are utilized to calibrate and test the SPH
code. We find that the statically measured compressive strength curve is only
applicable if we adjust it to the dynamic situation with a 'softness'
parameter. After determining this parameter, the SPH code is capable of
reproducing experimental results, which have not been used for the calibration

common message. However the latter region is not computable (except in certain
special cases) as no bounds on the cardinality of its auxiliary random
variables exist. Nor is it even clear that the inner bound is a closed set. The
main obstacle in proving cardinality bounds is the fact that the traditional
use of the Carath\'{e}odory theorem, the main known tool for proving
cardinality bounds, does not yield a finite cardinality result. One of the main
contributions of this paper is the introduction of a new tool based on an
identity that relates the second derivative of the Shannon entropy of a
discrete random variable (under a certain perturbation) to the corresponding
Fisher information. In order to go beyond the traditional Carath\'{e}odory type
arguments, we identify certain properties that the auxiliary random variables
corresponding to the extreme points of the inner bound need to satisfy. These
properties are then used to establish cardinality bounds on the auxiliary
random variables of the inner bound, thereby proving the computability of the
region, and its closedness.

bound and the recent outer bound of Nair and El Gamal do not match in general.

planet regions inside the ice line around M dwarf stars through N-body
simulations including tidal interactions with disk gas. Because of low
luminosity of M dwarfs, habitable zones (HZs) are located in inner regions. In
the close-in HZ, type-I migration and the orbital decay induced by eccentricity
damping are efficient according to the high disk gas density in the small
orbital radii. In the case of full efficiency of type-I migration predicted by
the linear theory, we found that protoplanets that migrate to the vicinity of
the host star undergo close scatterings and collisions, and 4 to 6 planets
eventually remain in mutual mean motion resonances and their orbits have small
eccentricities and they are stable both before and after disk gas decays. In
the case of slow migration, the resonant capture is so efficient that
densely-packed ~ 40 small protoplanets remain in mutual mean motion resonances.
In this case, they start orbit crossing, after the disk gas decays and
eccentricity damping due to tidal interaction with gas is no more effective.
Through merging of the protoplanets, several planets in widely-separated
non-resonant orbits with relatively large eccentricities are formed. Thus, the
final orbital configurations of the terrestrial planets around M dwarfs
sensitively depend on strength of type-I migration. We also found that large
amount of water-ice is delivered by type-I migration from outer regions and
final planets near the inner disk edge around M dwarfs are generally abundant
in water-ice except for the innermost one that is shielded by the outer
planets, unless type-I migration speed is reduced by a factor of more than 100
from that predicted by the linear theory.

performed as an extension of a previous work\cite{Shibata:2006nm}. We prepare
binary neutron stars with a large initial orbital separation and employ the
moving-puncture formulation, which enables to follow merger and ringdown phases
for a long time, even after black hole formation. For modeling inspiraling
neutron stars, which should be composed of cold neutron stars, the
Akmal-Pandhalipande-Ravenhall (APR) equation of state (EOS) is adopted. After
the onset of the merger, the hybrid-type EOS is used; i.e., the cold and
thermal parts are given by the APR and $\Gamma$-law EOSs, respectively. Three
equal-mass binaries each with mass $1.4M_\odot,1.45M_\odot,1.5M_\odot$ and two
unequal-mass binaries with mass 1.3--$1.6M_\odot$, 1.35--$1.65M_\odot$ are
prepared. We focus primarily on the black hole formation case, and explore mass
and spin of the black hole, mass of disks which surround the black hole, and
gravitational waves emitted during the black hole formation. We find that (i)
for the systems of $m_0=2.9$--$3.0M_\odot$ and of mass ratio $\approx 0.8$, the
mass of disks which surround the formed black hole is 0.006--$0.02M_{\odot}$;
(ii) the spin of the formed black hole is $0.78 \pm 0.02$ when a black hole is
formed after the merger in the dynamical time scale. This value depends weakly
on the total mass and mass ratio, and is about 0.1 larger than that of a black
hole formed from nonspinning binary black holes; (iii) for the black-hole
formation case, Fourier spectrum shape of gravitational waves emitted in the
merger and ringdown phases has a universal qualitative feature irrespective of
the total mass and mass ratio, but quantitatively, the spectrum reflects the
parameters of the binary neutron stars.

that the density matrix satisfies a dissipative master equation, primarily from
the study of renormalization group flows in non-critical string theory.This
interpretation of the zero mode of the Liouville field as time leads
necessarily to the CPT operator being ill defined. One striking consequence is
that the quantum mechanical correlations of pair states of neutral mesons
produced in meson factories are changed from the usual EPR state. The magnitude
of this departure from EPR correlations is characterised by a parameter
$\omega$. The predicted value of $\omega$ is very small or zero. However it is

Sampling the vertical energy gap along CDFT-MD trajectories, and correcting for

leading to an induced attraction between the mobile atoms that may even

we derive an effective Hubbard model for the lighter species accounting for the

the tunneling is drastically affected: Varying the degree of localization of

energy of an analytical bipole. The analytical bipole has been generated using
the force-free field approximation with a known value of constant $\alpha$ and

are used to generate Stokes profiles from the Unno-Rachkovsky solutions for
polarized radiative transfer equations. Then we add random noise of the order
of 10$^{-3}$ of the continuum intensity (I$_{c}$) in these profiles to simulate
the real profiles obtained by modern spectropolarimeters like Hinode (SOT/SP),
SVM (USO), ASP, DLSP, POLIS, SOLIS etc. These noisy profiles are then inverted
using a Milne-Eddington inversion code to retrieve the magnetic parameters.
Hundred realizations of this process of adding random noise and polarimetric
inversion is repeated to study the distribution of error in global $\alpha$ and
magnetic energy values. The results show that : (1). the sign of $\alpha$ is
not influenced by polarimetric noise and very accurate values of global twist
can be calculated, and (2). accurate estimation of magnetic energy with
uncertainty as low as 0.5% is possible under the force-free condition.

limited mostly by the finite decoherence rates of the qubits. Recently a
substantial progress was achieved in enhancing the time, which a solid-state
qubit demonstrates a coherent dynamics. This progress is based mostly on a
successful isolation of the qubits from external decoherence sources. Under
these conditions the material-inherent sources of noise start to play a crucial
role. In most cases the noise that quantum device demonstrate has 1/f spectrum.
This suggests that the environment that destroys the phase coherence of the
qubit can be thought of as a system of two-state fluctuators, which experience
random hops between their states. In this short review we discuss the current
state of the theory of the decoherence due to the qubit interaction with the
fluctuators. We describe the effect of such an environment on different
protocols of the qubit manipulations - free induction and echo signal. It turns
out that in many important cases the noise produced by the fluctuators is
non-Gaussian. Consequently the results of the interaction of the qubit with the
fluctuators are not determined by the pair correlation function only.
  We describe the effect of the fluctuators using so-called spin-fluctuator
model. Being quite realistic this model allows one to evaluate the qubit
dynamics in the presence of one fluctuator exactly. This solution is found, and
its features, including non-Gaussian effects are analyzed in details. We extend
this consideration for the systems of large number of fluctuators, which
interact with the qubit and lead to the 1/f noise. We discuss existing
experiments on the Josephson qubit manipulation and try to identify
non-Gaussian behavior.

  Data: The Conflict Between Outflow and Photon Trapping","15 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in PASJ",,"10.1093/pasj/61.4.783",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Photon trapping and outflow are two key physics associated with the
supercritical accretion flow. We investigate the conflict between these two
processes based on two-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic (RHD) simulation data
and construct a simplified (radially) one-dimensional model. Mass loss due to
outflow, which is not considered in the slim-disk model, will reduce surface
density of the flow, and if very significant, it will totally suppress photon
trapping effects. If the photon trapping is very significant, conversely,
outflow will be suppressed because radiation pressure force will be reduced. To
see what actually occurs, we examine the RHD simulation data and evaluate the
accretion rate and outflow rate as functions of radius. We find that the former
monotonically decreases, while the latter increases, as the radius decreases.
However, the former is kept constant at small radii, inside several
Schwarzschild radii, since the outflow is suppressed by the photon trapping
effects. To understand the conflict between the photon trapping and outflow in
a simpler way, we model the radial distribution of the accretion rate from the
simulation data and build up a new (radially) one-dimensional model, which is
similar to the slim-disk model but incorporates the mass loss effects due to
the outflow. We find that the surface density (and, hence, the optical depth)
is much reduced even inside the trapping radius, compared with the case without
outflow, whereas the effective temperature distribution hardly changes. That
is, the emergent spectra do not sensitively depend on the amount of mass
outflow. We conclude that the slim-disk approach is valid for interpreting
observations, even if the outflow is taken into account.

describing mutations. Although the stepping stone model was first proposed for
population genetics, it is closely related to ""voter models"" of interest in
nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. The stepping stone model can also be
regarded as an approximation to the dynamics of a thin layer of actively
growing pioneers at the frontier of a colony of microorganisms undergoing a
range expansion on a Petri dish. We find that the population tends to segregate
into monoallelic domains. This segregation slows down genetic drift and
selection because these two evolutionary forces can only act at the boundaries
between the domains; the effects of mutation, however, are not significantly
affected by the segregation. Although fixation in the neutral well-mixed (or
""zero dimensional"") model occurs exponentially in time, it occurs only
algebraically fast in the one-dimensional model. If selection is weak,
selective sweeps occur exponentially fast in both well-mixed and
one-dimensional populations, but the time constants are different. We also find
an unusual sublinear increase in the variance of the spatially averaged allele
frequency with time. Although we focus on two alleles or variants, q-allele
Potts-like models of gene segregation are considered as well. We also
investigate the effects of geometry at the frontier by considering growth of

total mass (gas + dark matter) of these galaxies is the main driver of their
evolution. Star formation (SF) occurs in series of short bursts. In massive
systems, the very short intervals between the SF peaks mimic a continuous star
formation rate, while less massive systems exhibit well separated SF bursts, as
identified observationally. The delay between the SF events is controlled by
the gas cooling time dependence on galaxy mass. The observed global scaling
relations, luminosity-mass and luminosity-metallicity, are reproduced with low
scatter. We take advantage of the unprecedentedly large sample size and data
homogeneity of the ESO Large Programme DART, and add to it a few independent
studies, to constrain the star formation history of five Milky Way dSphs,

that the global stability is ensured if the ISM is multiphased, composed of two
partially coupled phases, a visible warm gas phase and a weakly collisionless
cold dark phase corresponding to a fraction of the unseen baryons. The phases
are subject to stellar and UV background heating and gas cooling, and their
transformation into each other is studied as a function of the coupling
strength. This new model, which still possesses a dark matter halo, fits the
rotation curves as well as the classical CDM halos, but is the only one to
explain the existence of an open and contrasting spiral structure, as observed
in the outer HI disks

condensates $<\bar{q}q>$ and diquark condensates $<qq>$ in vacuum in two-flavor
four-fermion interaction models is researched. The results show that the
$G_S$-$H_S$ (the coupling constant of scalar $(\bar{q}q)^2$-scalar $(qq)^2$
channel) phase diagrams will be qualitatively consistent with the case of
$N_c=3$ as $N_c$ varies in 4D Nambu-Jona Lasinio model and 2D Gross-Neveu (GN)
model. However, in 3D GN model, the behavior of the $G_S$-$H_P$ (the coupling
constant of pseudoscalar $(qq)^2$ channel) phase diagram will obviously depend
on $N_c$. The known characteristic that a 3D GN model has not the coexistence
phase of the condensates $<\bar{q}q>$ and $<qq>$ is proven to appear only in
the case of $N_c\leq 4$. In all the models, the regions occupied by the phases
containing the diquark condensates $<qq>$ in corresponding phase diagrams will
gradually decrease as $N_c$ grows up and finally go to zero if $N_c \to
\infty$, i.e. in this limit only the pure $<\bar{q}q>$ phase could exist.

stars develop a convective shell around the helium core. This intermediate
convective zone (ICZ) plays an essential role in governing which g-modes are
excited. Indeed a strong radiative damping occurs in the high density radiative
core but the ICZ acts as a barrier preventing the propagation of some g-modes
into the core. These g-modes can thus be excited in supergiant stars by the
kappa-mechanism in the superficial layers due to the opacity bump of iron, at
log T=5.2. However massive stars are submitted to various complex phenomena
such as rotation, magnetic fields, semiconvection, mass loss, overshooting.
Each of these phenomena exerts a significant effect on the evolution and some
of them could prevent the onset of the convective zone. We develop a numerical
method which allows us to select the reflected, thus the potentially excited,
modes only. We study different cases in order to show that mass loss and
overshooting, in a large enough amount, reduce the extent of the ICZ and are
unfavourable to the excitation of g-modes.

U-boson decays into neutrinos, BESIII can measure the coupling of the extra $
U(1)$ down to $ O(10^{- 4}) \sim O(10^{- 5})$ because of the low Standard Model
backgrounds. In the visible channel where U-boson decays into charged lepton
pair, BESIII can only measure the coupling down to $ O(10^{- 3}) \sim O(10^{-

observed by the PAMELA cosmic-ray (CR) detector through the identification of a
Galactic diffuse gamma-ray component associated to DM-induced prompt and
radiative emission. The goal is to present an analysis based on minimal sets of
assumptions and extrapolations with respect to locally testable or measurable
quantities. We discuss the differences between the spatial and spectral
features for the DM-induced components (with an extended, possibly spherical,
source function) and those for the standard CR contribution (with sources
confined within the stellar disc), and propose to focus on intermediate and
large latitudes. We address the dependence of the signal to background ratio on
the model adopted to describe the propagation of charged CRs in the Galaxy, and
find that, in general, the DM-induced signal can be detected by the Fermi
Gamma-ray Space Telescope at energies above 100 GeV. An observational result in
agreement with the prediction from standard CR components only, would imply
very strong constraints on the DM interpretation of the PAMELA excess. On the
other hand, if an excess in the diffuse emission above 100 GeV is identified,
the angular profile for such emission would allow for a clean disentanglement
between the DM interpretation and astrophysical explanations proposed for the
PAMELA excess. We also compare to the radiative diffuse emission at lower
frequencies, sketching in particular the detection prospects at infrared
frequencies with the Planck satellite.

likely to be a generic property of all biochemical life. Due to the optical
activity of chiral molecules, it has been hypothesized that this unique
characteristic may provide a suitable remote sensing probe using circular
polarization spectroscopy. Here, we report the detection of circular
polarization in light scattered by photosynthetic microbes. We show that the
circular polarization appears to arise from circular dichroism of the strong
electronic transitions of photosynthetic absorption bands. We conclude that
circular polarization spectroscopy could provide a powerful remote sensing
technique for generic life searches.

The geometry of the underlying manifold does not affect the form of the
