F-theory GUT models. In both cases the mass scale of the neutrinos m_nu ~
(M_weak)^2/M_UV arises from integrating out Kaluza-Klein modes, where M_UV is
close to the GUT scale. The participation of non-holomorphic Kaluza-Klein mode
wave functions dilutes the mass hierarchy in comparison to the quark and
charged lepton sectors, in agreement with experimentally measured mass
splittings. The neutrinos are predicted to exhibit a ""normal"" mass hierarchy,
with masses m_3,m_2,m_1 ~ .05*(1,(alpha_GUT)^(1/2),alpha_GUT) eV. When the
interactions of the neutrino and charged lepton sectors geometrically unify,
the neutrino mixing matrix exhibits a mild hierarchical structure such that the
mixing angles theta_23 and theta_12 are large and comparable, while theta_13 is
expected to be smaller and close to the Cabibbo angle: theta_13 ~ theta_C ~
(alpha_GUT)^(1/2) ~ 0.2. This suggests that theta_13 should be near the current
experimental upper bound.

the absence of collinear Fe--R Heisenberg interactions in RFeAsO. A strong

As a special case the well-known expressions for the Green's function and
oscillator density of the homogeneous linear chain are contained in the model.
The width of the frequency band is determined by the grading parameter which
characterizes the exponential spatial dependence of the properties. In the
limiting case of large grading parameter, the frequency band is localized

templates with different In concentration. The hole density, the Curie
temperature, and the relaxed lattice constant of the as-grown and annealed

Angle-dependent magnetotransport measurements performed at different magnetic
field strengths were used to probe the magnetic anisotropy. The measurements
reveal a pronounced linear dependence of the uniaxial out-of-plane anisotropy
on both strain and hole density. Whereas the uniaxial and cubic in-plane
anisotropies are nearly constant, the cubic out-of-plane anisotropy changes
sign when the magnetic easy axis flips from in-plane to out-of-plane. The
experimental results for the magnetic anisotropy are quantitatively compared

one of the corner stones of the stellar magnetism theory. On one hand, since
they survive over secular time-scales, they may modify the structure and the
evolution of their host stars. On the other hand, they must have a complex
stable structure since it has been demonstrated by Tayler and collaborators
that simplest purely poloidal or toroidal fields are unstable on dynamical
time-scales. In this context, the only stable configuration which has been
found today is the one resulting of a numerical simulation by Braithwaite and
collaborators who have studied the evolution of an initial stochastic magnetic
field, which is found to relax on a mixed stable configuration (poloidal and
toroidal) that seems to be in equilibrium and then diffuses. Aims. In this
work, we thus go on the track of such type of equilibrium field in a
semi-analytical way. Methods. In this first article, we study the barotropic
magnetohydrostatic equilibrium states; the problem reduces to a
Grad-Shafranov-like equation with arbitrary functions. Those latters are
constrained by deriving the lowest-energy equilibrium states for given
invariants of the considered axisymmetric problem and in particular for a given
helicity which is known to be one of the main actor of such problems. Then, we
obtain the generalization of the force-free Taylor's relaxation states obtained
in laboratory experiments (in spheromaks) that become non force-free in the
self-gravitating stellar case. The case of general baroclinic equilibrium
states will be studied in Paper II. Results. Those theoretical results are
applied to realistic stellar cases, namely to the solar radiative core and to

separate from the condensate as a single bubble; {\it III}) the localized

more than a decade. Furthermore we use DI line profile reconstructions to
identify influences of long-lasting starspots on RV measurements. In this way

constraints on dark energy that will be achieved prior to the Joint Dark Energy
Mission (JDEM) by ground-based experiments that exploit baryon acoustic
oscillations, type Ia supernovae, and weak gravitational lensing. We show that
cluster counts from on-going and near-future surveys should provide robust,
complementary dark energy constraints. In particular, we find that optimally
combined optical and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect cluster surveys should improve
the Dark Energy Task Force (DETF) figure of merit for pre-JDEM projects by a
factor of two even without prior knowledge of the nuisance parameters in the
cluster mass-observable relation. Comparable improvements are achieved in the
forecast precision of parameters specifying the principal component description
of the dark energy equation of state parameter as well as in the growth index
gamma. These results indicate that cluster counts can play an important
complementary role in constraining dark energy and modified gravity even if the
associated systematic errors are not strongly controlled.

  speed","An updated version of this paper is shown in astro-ph/0610610",,,,"physics.gen-ph astro-ph.CO gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a compelling argument for the physical light speed in the
Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe to vary with the cosmic time
coordinate ""t"" of FLRW. It must be variable when the radial comoving
differential coordinates of FLRW is interpreted as physical and therefore
transformable by a Lorentz transform locally to differentials of stationary
physical coordinates. Because the FLRW differential radial distance has a time
varying coefficient a(t), integration of the transformed differentials to
obtain stationary coordinates for a short radial distance requires the light
speed c(t) to be proportional to the square root of da/dt. Since we assume
homogeneity of space, this derived c(t) is the physical light speed on all
points of the FLRW universe. This impacts the interpretation of all
astronomical observations of distant phenomena that are sensitive to light
speed. A world transform from FLRW that has a Minkowski metric close to the
origin is shown to have a physical radius out to all points of the visible
universe. In order to obtain numerical values for c(t), the general relativity
(GR) field equation is extended by using a variable gravitational constant and
rest mass that keeps constant the gravitational and particle rest energies.
This also keeps constant the proportionality constant between the GR tensors of
the field equation and conserves the rest stress-energy tensor of the ideal
fluid used in the FLRW GR field equation. In the same way all of special and
general relativity is extended to include a variable light speed.

revealed when a star passes close enough to be torn apart by tidal forces, and
a flare of electromagnetic radiation is emitted when the bound fraction of the

the third candidate tidal disruption event discovered in the GALEX Deep Imaging
Survey: a 1.6x10^{43} erg s^{-1} UV/optical flare from a star-forming galaxy at
z=0.1855. The UV/optical SED during the peak of the flare measured by GALEX and
Palomar LFC imaging can be modeled as a single temperature blackbody with
T_{bb}=1.7x10^{5} K and a bolometric luminosity of 3x10^{45} erg s^{-1},
assuming an internal extinction with E(B-V)_{gas}=0.3. The Chandra upper limit
on the X-ray luminosity during the peak of the flare, L_{X}(2-10 keV)< 10^{41}
erg s^{-1}, is 2 orders of magnitude fainter than expected from the ratios of
UV to X-ray flux density observed in active galaxies. We compare the light
curves and broadband properties of all three tidal disruption candidates
discovered by GALEX, and find that (1) the light curves are well fitted by the
power-law decline expected for the fallback of debris from a tidally disrupted
solar-type star, and (2) the UV/optical SEDs can be attributed to thermal
emission from an envelope of debris located at roughly 10 times the tidal
disruption radius of a ~10^{7} M_sun central black hole. We use the observed
peak absolute optical magnitudes of the flares (-17.5 > M_{g} > -18.9) to
predict the detection capabilities of upcoming optical synoptic surveys.

two young stars, GM Aur and AA Tau, which have moderate to high inclinations.
The emission from both sources appears centered near the stellar velocity and
is broader than the [NeII] emission measured previously for the face-on disk
system TW Hya. These properties are consistent with a disk origin for the
[NeII] emission we detect, with disk rotation (rather than photoevaporation or
turbulence in a hot disk atmosphere) playing the dominant role in the origin of
the line width. In the non-face-on systems, the [NeII] emission is narrower
than the CO fundamental emission from the same sources. If the widths of both
diagnostics are dominated by Keplerian rotation, this suggests that the [NeII]
emission arises from larger disk radii on average than does the CO emission.
The equivalent width of the [NeII] emission we detect is less than that of the
spectrally unresolved [NeII] feature in the Spitzer spectra of the same
sources. Variability in the [NeII] emission or the mid-infrared continuum, a
spatially extended [NeII] component, or a very (spectrally) broad [NeII]
component might account for the difference in the equivalent widths.

extensively so far. Studying the variability in polarization makes it possibly
to distinguish between different emission mechanisms. Thus it can help
answering the question if intranight variability in radio-loud and radio-quiet
AGN is of the same or of fundamentally different origin. In this paper we
investigate intranight polarization variability in AGN. Our sample consists of
28 AGN at low to moderate redshifts (0.048 < z < 1.036), 12 of which are
radio-quiet quasars (RQQs) and 16 are radio-loud blazars. The subsample of
blazars consists of eight flat-spectrum radio-quasars (FSRQs) and eight BL Lac
objects. We find clear differences between the two samples. A majority of the
radio-loud AGN show moderate to high degrees of polarization, more than half of
them also show variability in polarization. There seems to be a dividing line
for polarization intranight variability at P~5 per cent over which all objects
vary in polarization. Only two out of 12 radio-quiet quasars show polarized
emission, both at levels of P<1 per cent. The lack of polarization intranight
variability in radio-quiet AGN points towards accretion instabilities being the
cause for intranight flux variability whereas the high duty cycle of
polarization variability in radio-loud objects is more likely caused by
instabilities in the jet or changes of physical conditions in the jet plasma.

ghost bubble from earlier radio activity. There also appears to be a ghost
bubble present to the NW of the cluster center. The cycle time measured for the
radio source is approximately 2 x 10^7 yr using either the shock separation or
the rise time of the bubbles. The energy deposited by the radio source,
including a combination of direct shock heating and heating by buoyantly rising
bubbles inflated by the AGN, can offset the cooling in the core of the cluster.

Part I [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 79}, 033836 (2009)]. Here we concentrate on
experimental consequences for cavity QED of two different classes of
representations of harmonic oscillator Lie algebras. The zero-temperature
master equation, derived in Part I for irreducible representations of the
algebra, is reformulated in a reducible representation that models
electromagnetic fields by a gas of harmonic oscillator wave packets. The
representation is known to introduce automatic regularizations that in
irreducible representations would have to be justified by ad hoc arguments.
Predictions based on this representation are characterized in thermodynamic
limit by a single parameter $\varsigma$, responsible for collapses and revivals
of Rabi oscillations in exact vacuum. Collapses and revivals disappear in the
limit $\varsigma\to\infty$. Observation of a finite $\varsigma$ would mean that
cavity quantum fields are described by a non-Wightmanian theory, where vacuum
states are zero-temperature Bose-Einstein condensates of a finite-particle
bosonic oscillator gas and, thus, are non-unique. The data collected in the
experiment of Brune {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf{76}}, 1800 (1996)] are

explain this apparent long-term variation as an artifact of probable short-term

large number of small active regions spread across the star. In contrast, the

Combining the kinematics with morphology we propose a near-center collision
model to interpret the object. We find that the massive disk is likely to have
survived the collision of galaxies with an initial mass ratio of ~4:1. The
N-body/SPH simulations show that the collision possibly is a single-shot polar
collision with a very small pericentric distance of ~1 kpc and that the remnant
of the main galaxy will be dominated by a disk. The results support the disk
survival hypothesis. The survival of the disk is related to the polar collision
with an extremely small pericentric distance. With the help of N-body/SPH
simulations we find the probability of disk survival is quite large regardless
whether the two galaxies merge or not.

solution to the hierarchy problem and leads to the presence of a light Higgs. A
Higgs boson with mass above the present experimental bound may only be obtained
for relatively heavy third generation squarks, requiring a precise, somewhat
unnatural balance between different contributions to the effective Higgs mass
parameter. It was recently noticed that somewhat heavier Higgs bosons, which
are naturally beyond the LEP bound, may be obtained by enhanced weak SU(2)
D-terms. Such contributions appear in models with an enhanced electroweak gauge
symmetry, provided the supersymmetry breaking masses associated with the
scalars responsible for the breakdown of the enhanced gauge symmetry group to
the Standard Model one, are larger than the enhanced symmetry breaking scale.
In this article we emphasize that the enhanced SU(2) D-terms will not only
raise the Higgs boson mass but also affect the spectrum of the non-standard
Higgs bosons, sleptons and squarks, which therefore provide a natural
contribution to the T parameter, compensating for the negative one coming from
the heavy Higgs boson. The sleptons and non-standard Higgs bosons of these
models, in particular, may act in a way similar to the so-called inert Higgs
doublet. The phenomenological properties of these models are emphasized and
possible cosmological implications as well as collider signatures are

rigorously examined the finite sample performance of the estimators and
associated methods of hypothesis testing. While ML is usually preferred on the
basis of its asymptotic properties - it achieves the Cramer-Rao (CR) lower

the asymptotic and finite-sample properties of the ML estimators and test
statistics for two different choices of measurement bases: the average case
optimal or mutually unbiased bases (MUB) and a representative set of suboptimal

the ML unreliable for experimentally realistic sample sizes. The results
indicate that in order to fully exploit the information geometry of quantum

electron and $u, d$ quarks, arise from a pseudoscalar interaction with a new
spin 0 field $\tau(x)$, odd in $P$ and $T$, but even in $C$. This interaction
contains a factor $i\gamma_5$ in the quark and lepton Dirac algebra, so that
the full Hamiltonian is $P$, $T$ conserving; but by spontaneous symmetry
breaking, the new field $\tau(x)$ has a nonzero expectation value $<\tau>\neq
0$ that breaks $P$ and $T$ symmetry. Oscillations of $\tau(x)$ about its
expectation value produce a new particle, the ""timeon"". The mass of timeon is
expected to be high because of its flavor-changing properties.
  The main body of the paper is on the low energy phenomenology of the timeon
model. As we shall show, for the quark system the model gives a compact
3-dimensional geometric picture consisting of two elliptic plates and one
needle, which embodies the ten observables: six quark masses, three Eulerian
angles $\theta_{12}, \theta_{23}, \theta_{31}$ and the Jarlskog invariant of
the CKM matrix.
  For leptons, we assume that the neutrinos do not have a direct timeon
interaction; therefore, the lowest neutrino mass is zero. The timeon
interaction with charged leptons yields the observed nonzero electron mass,
analogous to the up and down quark masses. Furthermore, the timeon model for
leptons contains two fewer theoretical parameters than observables. Thus, there
are two testable relations between the three angles $\theta_{12}, \theta_{23},
\theta_{31}$ and the Jarlskog invariant of the neutrino mapping matrix.

models with hidden variables is the subject of a long lasting debate. In 1964,
Bell showed that certain types of classical models cannot explain the quantum
mechanical predictions for specific states of distant particles. Along this
line, some types of hidden variable models have been experimentally ruled out.
An intuitive feature for classical models is non-contextuality: the property
that any measurement has a value which is independent of other compatible
measurements being carried out at the same time. However, the results of
Kochen, Specker, and Bell show that non-contextuality is in conflict with
quantum mechanics. The conflict resides in the structure of the theory and is
independent of the properties of special states. It has been debated whether
the Kochen-Specker theorem could be experimentally tested at all. Only
recently, first tests of quantum contextuality have been proposed and
undertaken with photons and neutrons. Yet these tests required the generation
of special quantum states and left various loopholes open. Here, using trapped
ions, we experimentally demonstrate a state-independent conflict with
non-contextuality. The experiment is not subject to the detection loophole and
we show that, despite imperfections and possible measurement disturbances, our
results cannot be explained in non-contextual terms.

independent structured reservoirs is studied using a non-perturbative approach.
It is shown that the revival of atom entanglement is not necessarily
accompanied by the sudden death of reservoir entanglement, and vice versa. In
fact, atom entanglement can revive before, simultaneously or even after the
disentanglement of reservoirs. Using a novel method based on the population
analysis for the excited atomic state, we present the quantitative criteria for
the revival and death phenomena. For giving a more physically intuitive
insight, the quasimode Hamiltonian method is applied. Our quantitative analysis
is helpful for the practical engineering of entanglement.

transfer in MHD turbulence and results in energy accumulation in the system.
This accumulation proceeds until the vortex intensification compensates the
decreasing efficiency of nonlinear interactions. The formula for estimating the
average turbulence energy is obtained for the set ratio between the injected
helicity and energy. It is remarkable that the turbulence accumulates the
injected cross helicity at its low rate injection -- the integral correlation
coefficient significantly exceeds the ratio between the injected helicity and

  Logic Programming","To be published in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)",,,,"cs.AI cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This papers develops a logical language for representing probabilistic causal
laws. Our interest in such a language is twofold. First, it can be motivated as
a fundamental study of the representation of causal knowledge. Causality has an
inherent dynamic aspect, which has been studied at the semantical level by
Shafer in his framework of probability trees. In such a dynamic context, where
the evolution of a domain over time is considered, the idea of a causal law as
something which guides this evolution is quite natural. In our formalization, a
set of probabilistic causal laws can be used to represent a class of
probability trees in a concise, flexible and modular way. In this way, our work
extends Shafer's by offering a convenient logical representation for his
semantical objects.
  Second, this language also has relevance for the area of probabilistic logic
programming. In particular, we prove that the formal semantics of a theory in
our language can be equivalently defined as a probability distribution over the
well-founded models of certain logic programs, rendering it formally quite
similar to existing languages such as ICL or PRISM. Because we can motivate and
explain our language in a completely self-contained way as a representation of
probabilistic causal laws, this provides a new way of explaining the intuitions
behind such probabilistic logic programs: we can say precisely which knowledge
such a program expresses, in terms that are equally understandable by a
non-logician. Moreover, we also obtain an additional piece of knowledge
representation methodology for probabilistic logic programs, by showing how
they can express probabilistic causal laws.

known to display low-dimensional dynamics. Although this phenomenon was first
observed about 20 years ago, its underlying cause has remained a puzzle. Here
we expose the structure working behind the scenes of these systems, by proving
that the governing equations are generated by the action of the Mobius group, a
three-parameter subgroup of fractional linear transformations that map the unit
disc to itself. When there are no auxiliary state variables, the group action
partitions the N-dimensional state space into three-dimensional invariant
manifolds (the group orbits). The N-3 constants of motion associated with this
foliation are the N-3 functionally independent cross ratios of the oscillator
phases. No further reduction is possible, in general; numerical experiments on
models of Josephson junction arrays suggest that the invariant manifolds often
contain three-dimensional regions of neutrally stable chaos.

duals of smooth Fano polytopes) using probes. The latter are line segments that
enter the polytope at an interior point of a facet and whose direction is
integrally transverse to this facet. A point inside the polytope is
displaceable by a probe if it lies less than half way along it. Using a
construction due to Fukaya-Oh-Ohta-Ono, we show that every rational polytope
has a central point that is not displaceable by probes. In the monotone (or
more generally, the reflexive) case, this central point is its unique interior
integral point. In the monotone case, every other point is displaceable by
probes if and only if the polytope satisfies the star Ewald condition. (This is
a strong version of the Ewald conjecture concerning the integral symmetric
points in the polytope.) Further, in dimensions up to and including three every
monotone polytope is star Ewald. These results are closely related to the
Fukaya-Oh-Ohta-Ono calculations of the Floer homology of the Lagrangian fibers
of a toric symplectic manifold, and have applications to questions introduced

the latter being security preserving. We consider the method of sender-side
state purification to compensate the preparation noise and show its
applicability in the realistic conditions of channel loss, untrusted channel
excess noise, and trusted detection noise. We show that purification makes the
scheme robust to the preparation noise (i.e., even the arbitrary noisy coherent

is of cardinality at most $b$ and of weight equal to the weight of the heaviest
vertex/edge in this class. The bounded max-vertex/edge-coloring problems ask
for such a coloring minimizing the sum of all color classes' weights.
  In this paper we present complexity results and approximation algorithms for
those problems on general graphs, bipartite graphs and trees. We first show
that both problems are polynomial for trees, when the number of colors is
fixed, and $H_b$ approximable for general graphs, when the bound $b$ is fixed.
For the bounded max-vertex-coloring problem, we show a 17/11-approximation
algorithm for bipartite graphs, a PTAS for trees as well as for bipartite
graphs when $b$ is fixed. For unit weights, we show that the known 4/3 lower
bound for bipartite graphs is tight by providing a simple 4/3 approximation
algorithm. For the bounded max-edge-coloring problem, we prove approximation
factors of $3-2/\sqrt{2b}$, for general graphs, $\min\{e, 3-2/\sqrt{b}\}$, for
bipartite graphs, and 2, for trees. Furthermore, we show that this problem is
NP-complete even for trees. This is the first complexity result for
max-coloring problems on trees.

Bi1-xLaxFeO3 series for 0 < x < 0.15. We confirm that doping with La reduces
the threshold magnetic field Hc for cancelling the magnetic spiral phase, and
we show that Hc decreases as the La content increases up to x=0.15, which is
the highest concentration for maintaining the non-centrosymmetric rhombohedral
structure of BiFeO3. Measurements of the dielectric constant as a function of
magnetic field in the series also show a maximum magneto-capacitance for
x=0.15.

the z_s=1.7 gravitationally lensed quasar SDSS J1004+4112 from 0.44-8.0 micron
(0.16-3.0 micron in the rest frame). The large angular extent of the lensed
images and their separation from the centralgalaxy of this cluster lens allows
the images to be resolved even with the Spitzer Space Telescope. Based on the
SED, the host galaxy is a mixture of relatively old and intermediate age stars
with an inferred stellar mass of log(M_stars/M_sun)=11.09+/-0.28 and a star
formation rate of log(Mdot/1 M_sun per yr)=1.21+/-0.26. Given the estimated
black hole mass of M_BH ~10^8.6 M_sun from locally-calibrated correlations of
black hole masses with line widths and luminosities, the black hole represents
a fraction log(M_BH/M_stars) = -2.49+/-0.28 of the stellar mass and it is
radiating at 0.24+/-0.05 of the Eddington limit. The ratio of the host stellar
mass to the black hole mass is only marginally consistent with the locally
observed ratio.
