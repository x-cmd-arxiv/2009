quantum field theory in which gravity is emergent at low energies, rather than
mediated by a fundamental gauge field. The Weinberg-Witten theorem forbids spin
2 massless modes from carrying Lorentz covariant stress-energy. In General
Relativity the stress-energy is not covariant because it violates a gauge
symmetry, but a gravitational theory without fundamental spin 2 gauge
invariance must either lack a stress-energy operator or have a non-relativistic
graviton. The latter option is incompatible with the principle of equivalence,
though such theories are not necessarily ruled out at low energies.

involving (among other tools) a ""normal form"" for the parameter dynamics, and
the 2D radial double-endpoint Strichartz estimate for Schroedinger operators
with sufficiently repulsive potentials (which may be of some independent

model on the triangular lattice with alternating stripes of site energy using
Barnes-Coleman slave bosons. We study the paramagnetic phases of this theory at
three quarters filling, where it is a model of Na_0.5CoO_2, Rb_0.5CoO_2, and
K_0.5CoO_2. This theory has two bands of fermionic quasi-particles: one of
which is filled or nearly filled and hence weakly correlated; the other is
half-filled or nearly half-filled and hence strongly correlated. Further
results depend strongly on the sign of the hopping integral, t. The light band
is always filled for t>0, but only becomes filled for |Delta/t|>=1.5 for t<0,
where Delta is the difference in the site energies of the two sublattices. A
metal--charge transfer insulator transition occurs at |Delta/t|=5.0 for t>0 and
|Delta/t|=8.0 for t<0. In the charge transfer insulator complete charge
disproportionation occurs: one sublattice is filled and the other in half
filled. We compare our results with exact diagonalisation calculations and
experiments on Na_0.5CoO_2, and discuss the relevance of our results to
Rb_0.5CoO_2 and K_0.5CoO_2. In particular we propose a resolution of seemingly
contradictory experimental results on Na_0.5CoO_2. Many experiments suggest
that there is a charge gap, yet quantum oscillations are observed suggesting
the existence of quasiparticle states at arbitrarily low excitation energies.
We argue that the heavy band is gapped while the light band, which contains
less than 1 charge carrier per 100 unit cells, remains ungapped.

suggest gas sloshing in the core. The most likely perturber is the nearby
galaxy NGC 5098b, which has been stripped of its gaseous atmosphere. Detailed
images of the core reveal several X-ray cavities, two of which, just north and
southeast of the central AGN, correlate with radio emission and have bright
X-ray rims, similar to buoyant bubbles seen in the ICM of other systems. We
estimate the pressures in the bubbles and rims and show that they are roughly
equal, consistent with these being young features, as suggested by their close
proximity to the central AGN. We assume that the other X-ray cavities in the
core, which show no correlation with existing radio observations, are ghost
cavities from previous AGN outbursts. An estimate of the mechanical energy
required to inflate the cavities indicates that it is sufficient to offset
radiative cooling of the gas for 15 Myr. Therefore, for a typical cycle time of
10^7 yrs, the central AGN energy output is enough to balance cooling over long

identify new RCB candidates on the basis of lightcurve data alone, now that
they have been collecting data for durations sufficiently long to reveal
multiple declines. Despite their small numbers, RCB stars may be of great
importance in understanding the late stages of stellar evolution. In
particular, their measured isotopic abundances imply that many, if not most,
RCB stars are produced by WD mergers, which may be the low-mass counterparts of
the more massive mergers thought to produce type Ia supernovae. Therefore,
establishing the population of RCB stars in the Galaxy will help constrain the

  Relativity","50 pages",,,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we sketch the proof of the extension of the stability theorem
of the Minkowski space in General Relativity done explicitly in previous work
by the present author. We discuss solutions of the Einstein vacuum (EV)
equations. We solve the Cauchy problem for more general, asymptotically flat
initial data than in the pioneering work `The Global Nonlinear Stability of the
Minkowski Space' of D. Christodoulou and S. Klainerman or than in any other
work. Moreover, we describe precisely the asymptotic behaviour. Our relaxed
assumptions on the initial data yield a spacetime curvature which is not
bounded in $L^{\infty}(M)$. As a major result, we encounter in our work
borderline cases, which we discuss in this paper as well. The fact that certain
of our estimates are borderline in view of decay indicates that the conditions
in our main theorem are sharp in so far as the assumptions on the decay at
infinity on the initial data are concerned. Thus, the borderline cases are a
consequence of our relaxed assumptions on the data. They are not present in the
other works, as all of them place stronger assumptions on their data. We work
with an invariant formulation of the EV equations. Our main proof is based on a
bootstrap argument. To close the argument, we have to show that the spacetime
curvature and the corresponding geometrical quantities have the required decay.
In order to do so, the Einstein equations are decomposed with respect to
specific foliations of the spacetime. This result generalizes the work `The
Global Nonlinear Stability of the Minkowski Space' of D. Christodoulou and S.
Klainerman.

risk management in the banking industry. We connect ideas from conventional
techniques -- like historical and Monte Carlo simulation -- and we come up with
a hybrid method that shares the advantages of standard procedures but
eliminates several of their drawbacks. Instead of considering the static
problem of constructing one or ten day ahead distributions for vectors of risk
factors, we embed the problem into a dynamic framework, where any time horizon
can be consistently simulated. Additionally, we use standard models from
mathematical finance for each risk factor, whence bridging the worlds of
trading and risk management.
  Our approach is based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs), like the
HJM-equation or the Black-Scholes equation, governing the time evolution of
risk factors, on an empirical calibration method to the market for the chosen
SDEs, and on an Euler scheme (or high-order schemes) for the numerical
evaluation of the respective SDEs. The empirical calibration procedure
presented in this paper can be seen as the SDE-counterpart of the so called
Filtered Historical Simulation method; the behavior of volatility stems in our
case out of the assumptions on the underlying SDEs. Furthermore, we are able to
easily incorporate ""middle-size"" and ""large-size"" events within our framework
always making a precise distinction between the information obtained from the
market and the one coming from the necessary a-priori intuition of the risk
manager.

cellular glycans that are attached to proteins and lipids. Glycans are involved
in fundamental biological processes, including protein folding and clearance,
cell proliferation and apoptosis, development, immune responses, and
pathogenesis. One of the major types of glycans, N-linked glycans, is formed by
sequential attachments of monosaccharides to proteins by a limited number of
enzymes. Many of these enzymes can accept multiple N-linked glycans as
substrates, thereby generating a large number of glycan intermediates and their
intermingled pathways. Motivated by the quantitative methods developed in
complex network research, we investigated the large-scale organization of such
N-linked glycosylation pathways in mammalian cells. The N-linked glycosylation
pathways are extremely modular, and are composed of cohesive topological
modules that directly branch from a common upstream pathway of glycan
synthesis. This unique structural property allows the glycan production between
modules to be controlled by the upstream region. Although the enzymes act on
multiple glycan substrates, indicating cross-talk between modules, the impact
of the cross-talk on the module-specific enhancement of glycan synthesis may be
confined within a moderate range by transcription-level control. The findings
of the present study provide experimentally-testable predictions for
glycosylation processes, and may be applicable to therapeutic glycoprotein
engineering.

techniques that are well-suited to models defined in terms of a stochastic
generating mechanism. In a nutshell, Approximate Bayesian Computation proceeds
by computing summary statistics s_obs from the data and simulating summary
statistics for different values of the parameter theta. The posterior
distribution is then approximated by an estimator of the conditional density
g(theta|s_obs). In this paper, we derive the asymptotic bias and variance of
the standard estimators of the posterior distribution which are based on
rejection sampling and linear adjustment. Additionally, we introduce an
original estimator of the posterior distribution based on quadratic adjustment
and we show that its bias contains a fewer number of terms than the estimator
with linear adjustment. Although we find that the estimators with adjustment
are not universally superior to the estimator based on rejection sampling, we
find that they can achieve better performance when there is a nearly
homoscedastic relationship between the summary statistics and the parameter of
interest. To make this relationship as homoscedastic as possible, we propose to
use transformations of the summary statistics. In different examples borrowed
from the population genetics and epidemiological literature, we show the
potential of the methods with adjustment and of the transformations of the
summary statistics. Supplemental materials containing the details of the proofs

Borrowing results from statistical thermodynamics, we show that imposing the
Kugo-Ojima confinement criterion as a boundary condition leads to a modified
yet renormalizable partition function. We verify that the resulting partition
function is equivalent with the one obtained by Gribov and Zwanziger, which
restricts the domain of integration in the path integral within the first
Gribov horizon. The construction of an action implementing a boundary condition
allows one to discuss the symmetries of the system in the presence of the
boundary. In particular, the conventional BRST symmetry is softly broken.

of nonlinear blind source separation (BSS) is to find a ""source"" time series
s(t), comprised of statistically independent combinations of the measured

function in (s,ds/dt)-space that is equal to the product of density functions
of individual components. This formulation of the BSS problem has a solution
that is unique, up to permutations and component-wise transformations.
Separability is shown to impose constraints on certain locally invariant
(scalar) functions of x, which are derived from local higher-order correlations
of the data's velocity dx/dt. The data are separable if and only if they
satisfy these constraints, and, if the constraints are satisfied, the sources
can be explicitly constructed from the data. The method is illustrated by using
it to separate two speech-like sounds recorded with a single microphone.

in the disk-halo system. We confirm the previous results and quantify for the
first time the dual role that the DM halos play in the bar evolution: more
centrally concentrated halos dilute the dynamical processes, such as
spontaneous bar instability and vertical buckling instability, and slowdown the
J transfer, while facilitating it in the secular phase. Within the corotation
radius (Rcr), the disk J remains nearly constant, as long as Rcr stays within
the disk -- a sign that the lost J to the outer disk and the halo is being
compensated by an influx of fresh J due to the outward motion of Rcr. This is
feasible as long as the bar slowdown dominates the loss of J inside Rcr. We
find that in some models the bar pattern speed stalls for prolonged time
periods when Rcr is located outside the disk. This phenomenon appears
concurrent with the near absence of J transfer between the disk and the halo.
Furthermore, we confirm that stellar bars generally display the corotation to
bar size ratios in the range of ~1-1.4, but only between the times of the first
buckling and Rcr leaving the disk. The corotation-to-disk size ratio emerges as
an important dynamic discriminator between various stages of barred disk
evolution. Finally, we analyze a number of correlations between the basic
parameters of a barred disk and a halo, some already reported in the literature
and some new.

on the cold gas in a galaxy. It is difficult for feedback from near the
accretion disk to directly impact dense molecular clouds at ~kpc. But if such
feedback can drive a weak wind or outflow in the hot, diffuse ISM (a relatively
'easy' task), then in the wake of such an outflow passing over a cold cloud, a
combination of instabilities will drive the cloud material to effectively
expand in the direction perpendicular to the outflow. Such expansion
dramatically increases the effective cross section of the cloud material and
makes it more susceptible to ionization and momentum coupling from absorption
of the incident quasar radiation field. Even a moderate effect of this nature
can dramatically alter the ability of clouds at large radii to be fully ionized
and driven into a secondary outflow by radiation pressure. Since the amount of
momentum and volume which can be ionized by observed quasar radiation field is
more than sufficient to affect the entire cold gas supply once it has been
altered in this manner (and the 'initial' feedback need only initiate a
moderate wind in the low-density hot gas), this reduces by an order of
magnitude the required energy budget for feedback to affect a host galaxy.
Instead of ~5% of the radiated energy (~100% momentum) needed if the initial
feedback must directly heat or blow out the galactic gas, if only ~0.5% of the
luminosity (~10% momentum) can couple to drive the initial hot outflow, this
mechanism could be efficient. This amounts to hot gas outflow rates from near
the accretion disk of only 5-10% of the BH accretion rate.

the Carretta & Gratton (1997) metallicity scale. The mean metallicity is
<[Fe/H]> = -1.27 +/- 0.04 dex, with a standard deviation of 0.37. We find that
the stars in the inner field are more metal rich by [Fe/H] =0.30 +/- 0.06 dex.
These results are in agreement with previous photometric studies that found a
radial population gradient, as well as the expectation of higher metallicities
in the central star forming regions. Age estimates using Victoria-Regina
stellar models show that the youngest stars in the sample (< 6 Gyr) are more
metal rich by [Fe/H] = 0.32 +/- 0.08 dex. These stars also show a lower
velocity dispersion at all elliptical radii compared to the metal-poor stars.
Kinematics for the whole red giant sample suggest a velocity gradient
approximately half that of the gas rotation curve, with the stellar component
occupying a thicker disk decoupled from the HI rotation plane. Taken together,
the kinematics, metallicities, and ages in our sample suggest a young
metal-rich, and kinematically cold stellar population in the central gas-rich

integrative, systematic understanding of the associated biological processes,
they very rarely constitute a concrete guide to the actual physicochemical
mechanisms behind biological function and the role of these methods is more on
a hypotheses generating line. An important improvement could be done with the
development of a thermodynamic theory for gene expression and transcriptional
regulation that will build the foundations for a proper integration of the vast
amount of molecular biophysical data and could lead, in the future, to a
systemic view of genetic transcription and regulation.

regenerate the signal, without distortion, in the backward direction. The
different stages of the protocol are detailed and the recovery efficiency is
calculated in the semi-classical picture. Since the memory bandwidth is
determined by the Raman transition Doppler width, it can be adjusted by
changing the angle of the signal and control beams. The optical depth also
depends on the beam angle. As a consequence the available optical depth can be
optimized, depending on the needed bandwidth. The predicted recovery efficiency

data, we construct the most extensive spectral energy distribution of G1 to
date, spanning the wavelength range from 1538 to 20,000 A. A quantitative
comparison with a variety of simple stellar population (SSP) models yields a
mean age that is consistent with G1 being among the oldest building blocks of
M31 and having formed within ~1.7 Gyr after the Big Bang. Irrespective of the
SSP model or stellar initial mass function adopted, the resulting mass
estimates (of order $10^7 M_\odot$) indicate that G1 is one of the most massive
GCs in the Local Group. However, we speculate that the cluster's exceptionally
high mass suggests that it may not be a genuine GC. We also derive that G1 may
contain, on average, $(1.65\pm0.63)\times10^2 L_\odot$ far-ultraviolet-bright,
hot, extreme horizontal-branch stars, depending on the SSP model adopted. On a
generic level, we demonstrate that extensive multi-passband photometry coupled

Lr/Lx<10^{-5}. This does not mean jets are not launched during outbursts. On
the contrary, if the magnetic activity in erupting accreting disks is similar

expected. Hence magnetic flares similar to those in active stars might be the

spherical nature of the secondary wavelets. We solve this by analytically
continuing the surface of integration. If the surface is a sphere of radius
$R$, this is done by complexifying $R$ to $R+ia$. The resulting complex sphere
is shown to be a real bundle of disks with radius $a$ tangent to the sphere.
Huygens' ""secondary source points"" are thus replaced by disks, and his
spherical wavelets by well-focused pulsed beams propagating outward. This
solves the back-propagation problem. The extended Huygens principle is a
completeness relation for pulsed beams, giving a representation of a general
radiation field as a superposition of such beams. Furthermore, it naturally
yields a very efficient way to compute radiation fields because all pulsed
beams missing a given observer can be ignored. Increasing $a$ sharpens the
focus of the pulsed beams, which in turn raises the compression of the
representation.

and spectral behaviour during outbursts. In recent years a paradigm has arisen
in which ""soft"" X-ray states are associated with an inner disc radius at, or
very close to, the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) around the black
hole, while in ""hard"" X-ray states the inner edge of the disc is further from
the black hole. Models of advective flows suggest that as the X-ray luminosity
drops in hard states, the inner disc progressively recedes, from a few to
hundreds gravitational radii. Recent observations which show broad iron line
detections and estimates of the disc component strength suggest that a
non-recessed disc could still be present in bright hard states. In this study
we present a comprehensive analysis of the spectral components associated with
the inner disc, utilising data from instruments with sensitive low-energy
responses and including reanalyses of previously published results. A key
component of the study is to fully estimate systematic uncertainties by e.g.
investigating in detail the effect of having a hydrogen column density that is
fixed or free to vary. We conclude that for L_x > 0.01 of the Eddington limit,
spectral fits allow us to constrain the disc to be < 10R_g. There is, however,
clear evidence that when L_x is between 10^-2-- 10^-3 Eddington, the disc does
begin to recede. We include measurements of disc radii in two quiescent black
hole binaries, and present the inferred evolution of accretion parameters in
the entire range of bolometric luminosities 10^-8 -- 1 Eddington. We compare
our results with theoretical models and note that the implied rate of disc
recession with luminosity is consistent with recent empirical results on the
X-ray timing behaviour of black holes of all masses.

a closed 3-form by Park and Klimcik-Strobl, the study of three dimensional
sigma models with Wess-Zumino term leads in a likewise way to twisting of
Courant algebroid structures by closed 4-forms H.
  The presentation is kept pedagogical and accessible to physicists as well as
to mathematicians, explaining in detail in particular the interplay of field
transformations in a sigma model with the type of geometrical structures
induced on a target. In fact, as we also show, even if one does not know the
mathematical concept of a Courant algebroid, the study of a rather general
class of 3-dimensional sigma models leads one to that notion by itself.
  Courant algebroids became of relevance for mathematical physics lately from
several perspectives - like for example by means of using generalized complex
structures in String Theory. One may expect that their twisting by the
curvature H of some 3-form Ramond-Ramond gauge field will become of relevance
as well.

massive elliptical galaxies from $z \simeq 2$ to $z \simeq 0.1$ has been
interpreted in terms of either galaxy mergers or the rapid loss of cold gas due
to AGN feedback. In examining the latter case we have quantified the extent of
the expansion, which is uncertain observationally, in terms of the star
formation parameters and time of the expulsion of the cold gas. In either case,
the large global decrease in stellar density should translate into a major drop
in the ISM density and pressure, and a much steeper radial decline in those
quantities with cosmic epoch. These cosmological changes are expected to have a
major influence on the gas accretion mode, which will shift from `cold' thin
disk accretion at high redshifts toward `hot' Bondi fed ADAF accretion at low
redshifts. The decline of angular momentum inflow would then lead to a spin
down of the black hole, for which we have calculated more precise time scales;
a value of about 0.2 Gyr is typical for a $10^9 M_\odot$ central black hole.
These results have implications for the different cosmological evolutionary
patterns found for the luminosity functions of powerful and weak radio
galaxies.

flow in case of sufficiently strong rotation. This yields significant changes
in the flow characteristics and dispersion properties, which makes rotational
turbulence modulation particularly relevant in the context of atmospheric and
oceanic flows. Here we investigate the canonical flow of turbulence in a
periodic box, subjected to rotation about a fixed vertical axis. As point of
reference we consider direct numerical simulations of homogeneous isotropic
turbulence. Modulation due to rotation at various rotation rates (i.e.,
different Rossby numbers) is investigated. Special attention is paid to the
alteration of intermittency, which is measured in terms of changes in the
scaling of the structure functions. A reduction of intermittency quantified
with the longitudinal structure functions in the direction perpendicular to the
rotation axes will be presented. These numerical findings correspond well to
recent results obtained in experiments by Seiwert et al. (2008).

system modeling compressible fluid flow subject to a Navier-slip boundary
condition. The velocity (momentum) equation is approximated by a mixed finite
element method using the lowest order Nedelec spaces of the first kind. The
continuity equation is approximated by a standard piecewise constant upwind
discontinuous Galerkin scheme. Our main result states that the numerical method
converges to a weak solution. The convergence proof consists of two main steps:
(i) To establish strong spatial compactness of the velocity field, which is
intricate since the element spaces are only div or curl conforming. (ii) To
prove that the discontinuous Galerkin approximations converge strongly, which
is required in view of the nonlinear pressure function. Tools involved in the
analysis include a higher integrability estimate for the discontinuous Galerkin
approximations, a discrete equation for the effective viscous flux, and various
renormalized formulations of the discontinuous Galerkin scheme.
