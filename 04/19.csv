applied magnetic field are presented using two different approaches: the
imposed-field method where the electromotive force owing to the applied field
is used, and the test-field method where separate evolution equations are
solved for a set of different test fields. Both approaches agree for stronger
fields, but there are apparent discrepancies for weaker fields that can be
explained by the influence of dynamo-generated magnetic fields on the scale of
the domain that are referred to as meso-scale magnetic fields. Examples are
discussed where these meso-scale fields can lead to both drastically
overestimated and underestimated values of alpha compared with the kinematic
case. It is demonstrated that the kinematic value can be recovered by resetting
the fluctuating magnetic field to zero in regular time intervals. It is
concluded that this is the preferred technique both for the imposed-field and
the test-field methods.

about physical reality into the instructional process of quantum mechanics.
Taking into account that both scientific realism and constructivism represent,
on the basis of a rather broad spectrum, prevalent philosophical currents in
the domain of science education, the compatibility of their essential
commitments is examined against the conceptual structure of quantum theory. It
is argued in this respect that the objects of science do not simply constitute
'personal constructions' of the human mind for interpreting nature, as
individualist constructivist consider, neither do they form products of a
'social construction', as sociological constructivist assume; on the contrary,
they reflect objective structural aspects of the physical world. A realist
interpretation of quantum mechanics, we suggest, is not only possible but also
necessary for revealing the inner meaning of the theory's scientific content.
It is pointed out, however, that a viable realist interpretation of quantum
theory requires the abandonment or radical revision of the classical conception
of physical reality and its traditional metaphysical presuppositions. To this
end, we put forward an alternative to traditional realism interpretative
scheme, that is in harmony with the findings of present-day quantum theory, and
which, if adequately introduced into the instructional process of contemporary
physics, is expected to promote the conceptual reconstruction of learners
towards an appropriate view of nature.

""relative"" measurements. This problem arises in several sensor network
applications. The measurement model can be expressed in terms of a graph, whose
nodes correspond to the variables and edges to noisy measurements of the
difference between two variables. We take an arbitrary variable as the
reference and consider the optimal (minimum variance) linear unbiased estimate
of the remaining variables.
  We investigate how the error in the optimal linear unbiased estimate of a
node variable grows with the distance of the node to the reference node. We
establish a classification of graphs, namely, dense or sparse in Rd,1<= d <=3,
that determines how the linear unbiased optimal estimation error of a node
grows with its distance from the reference node. In particular, if a graph is
dense in 1,2, or 3D, then a node variable's estimation error is upper bounded
by a linear, logarithmic, or bounded function of distance from the reference,
respectively. Corresponding lower bounds are obtained if the graph is sparse in
1, 2 and 3D.
  Our results also show that naive measures of graph density, such as node
degree, are inadequate predictors of the estimation error. Being true for the
optimal linear unbiased estimate, these scaling laws determine
algorithm-independent limits on the estimation accuracy achievable in large
graphs.

survey of 21-cm absorption in a representative and unbiased sample of 35 strong
MgII systems in the redshift range: zabs~1.10-1.45, 33 of which have W_r>1 \AA.
The survey using ~400hrs of telescope time has resulted in 9 new 21-cm
detections and stringent 21-cm optical depth upper limits (median 3-sigma
optical depth per 10 km/s of 0.017) for the remaining 26 systems. This is by
far the largest number of 21-cm detections from any single survey of
intervening absorbers. Prior to our survey no intervening 21-cm system was
known in the above redshift range and only one system was known in the redshift
range 0.7<z<1.5. We discuss the relation between the detectability of 21-cm
absorption and various properties of UV absorption lines. We show that if MgII
systems are selected with the following criteria, MgII doublet ratio <1.3 and
W_r(MgI)/W_r(MgII)>0.3, then a detection rate of 21-cm absorption up to 90% can
be achieved. We estimate n_{21}, the number per unit redshift of 21-cm
absorbers with W_r(Mg(II)>W_o and integrated optical depth Tau_{21}>Tau_o and
show that n_{21} decreases with increasing redshift. In particular, for W_o=1.0
\AA and Tau_o>0.3 km\s, n_{21} falls by a factor 4 from <z>=0.5 to <z>=1.3. The
evolution seems to be stronger for stronger MgII systems. Using a subsample of
systems for which high frequency VLBA images are available, we show that the
effect is not related to the structure of the background radio sources and is
most probably due to the evolution of the cold neutral medium filling factor in
MgII systems. We find no correlation between the velocity spread of the 21-cm
absorption feature and W_r(MgII) at z~1.3.

underlies the theory of $X^{s,b}$ spaces of Bourgain and Klainerman-Machedon,
asserts (roughly speaking) that if two finite-energy solutions to the wave
equation are supported in transverse regions of the light cone in frequency
space, then their product lies in spacetime $L^2$ with a quantitative bound. In
this paper we consider the \emph{inverse problem} for this estimate: if the
product of two waves has large $L^2$ norm, what does this tell us about the
waves themselves? The main result, roughly speaking, is that the
lower-frequency wave is dispersed away from a bounded number of light rays.

electron-electron interactions in the Cooper channel lead to the negative
logarithmic in temperature correction to the tunneling conductance above the
critical temperature. Physically this result appears due to the density of
states suppression by superconductive fluctuations near the Fermi level. It is
interesting that the other correction, which accounts for the
Maki-Thompson-type interaction of fluctuations, is positive and exhibits strong
power law, which dominates the logarithmic term in the immediate vicinity of
the critical temperature. An interplay between these two contributions
determines the zero-bias anomaly in fluctuating superconductors. This paper is
devoted to the fate of such interaction corrections in the ballistic
superconductors. It turns out that ballistic dynamic fluctuations perturb
single-particle density of states near the Fermi level at the energy scale
which is different from that in the diffusive case. As the consequence,
fluctuation region becomes much broader. In this regime we confirm that
correction to the tunneling conductance remains negative and logarithmic not
too close to the critical temperature while in the immediate vicinity of the
transition we find novel power law for the Maki-Thompson contribution. It is
suggested that peculiar non-monotonous temperature dependence of the tunneling
conductance may be probed via magneto-tunnel experiments.

microarray data, for example with the goal of discovering cancer subtypes based

variables can overwhelm the few signals embedded in the high-dimensional space.
We propose a novel Bayesian approach based on Dirichlet process with a sparsity
prior that simultaneous performs variable selection and clustering, and also
discover variables that only distinguish a subset of the cluster components.
Unlike previous Bayesian formulations, we use Dirichlet process (DP) for both
clustering of samples as well as for regularizing the high-dimensional
mean/variance structure. To solve the computational challenge brought by this
double usage of DP, we propose to make use of a sequential sampling scheme

  configuration",,,,,"physics.plasm-ph physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a toroidal plasma confined by a purely toroidal magnetic field the plasma
transport is governed by electrostatic turbulence driven by the flute
interchange instability on the low-field side of the torus cross section. In
this paper we revisit experimental data obtained from the Blaamann torus at the
University of Tromso. On time-scales shorter than the poloidal rotation time,
the time series of potential and electron density fluctuations measured on
stationary Langmuir probes essentially reflect the spatial poloidal structure
of the turbulent field (Taylor hypothesis). On these time scales the signals
reveals an intermittent character exposed via analysis of probability density
functions and computation of multifractal dimension spectra in different
regimes of time scales. This intermittency is associated with the shape and
distribution of pronounced spikes in the signal. On time scales much longer
than the rotation period there are strong global fluctuations in the plasma
potential which are shown to to be the result of low-dimensional chaotic
dynamics.

  www.journalofoperationalrisk.com",,,"q-fin.RM q-fin.CP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Typically, operational risk losses are reported above some threshold. This
paper studies the impact of ignoring data truncation on the 0.999 quantile of
the annual loss distribution for operational risk for a broad range of
distribution parameters and truncation levels. Loss frequency and severity are
modelled by the Poisson and Lognormal distributions respectively. Two cases of
ignoring data truncation are studied: the ""naive model"" - fitting a Lognormal
distribution with support on a positive semi-infinite interval, and ""shifted
model"" - fitting a Lognormal distribution shifted to the truncation level. For
all practical cases, the ""naive model"" leads to underestimation (that can be
severe) of the 0.999 quantile. The ""shifted model"" overestimates the 0.999
quantile except some cases of small underestimation for large truncation
levels. Conservative estimation of capital charge is usually acceptable and the
use of the ""shifted model"" can be justified while the ""naive model"" should not
be allowed. However, if parameter uncertainty is taken into account (in
practice it is often ignored), the ""shifted model"" can lead to considerable
underestimation of capital charge. This is demonstrated with a practical
example.

  on IT",,"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.021413.110555",,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A common assumption in the existing network coding literature is that the
users are cooperative and non-selfish. However, this assumption can be violated
in practice. In this paper, we analyze inter-session network coding in a wired
network using game theory. We assume selfish users acting strategically to
maximize their own utility, leading to a resource allocation game among users.
In particular, we study the well-known butterfly network topology where a
bottleneck link is shared by several network coding and routing flows. We prove
the existence of a Nash equilibrium for a wide range of utility functions. We
show that the number of Nash equilibria can be large (even infinite) for
certain choices of system parameters. This is in sharp contrast to a similar
game setting with traditional packet forwarding where the Nash equilibrium is
always unique. We then characterize the worst-case efficiency bounds, i.e., the
Price-of-Anarchy (PoA), compared to an optimal and cooperative network design.
We show that by using a novel discriminatory pricing scheme which charges
encoded and forwarded packets differently, we can improve the PoA. However,
regardless of the discriminatory pricing scheme being used, the PoA is still
worse than for the case when network coding is not applied. This implies that,
although inter-session network coding can improve performance compared to
ordinary routing, it is significantly more sensitive to users' strategic
behaviour. For example, in a butterfly network where the side links have zero
cost, the efficiency can be as low as 25%. If the side links have non-zero
cost, then the efficiency can further reduce to only 20%. These results
generalize the well-known result of guaranteed 67% worst-case efficiency for
traditional packet forwarding networks.
