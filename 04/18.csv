the context of weak-scale supersymmetry. Such low mass scales can arise when
hidden sectors are more weakly coupled to supersymmetry breaking than the
visible sector, as happens when supersymmetry breaking is communicated to the
visible sector by gauge interactions under which the hidden sector is
uncharged, or if the hidden sector is sequestered from gravity-mediated
supersymmetry breaking. We study these mechanisms in detail in the context of
gauge and gaugino mediation, and present specific models of Abelian GeV-scale
hidden sectors. In particular, we discuss kinetic mixing of a U(1)_x gauge
force with hypercharge, singlets or bi-fundamentals which couple to both
sectors, and additional loop effects. Finally, we investigate the possible
relevance of such sectors for dark matter phenomenology, as well as for low-
and high-energy collider searches.

holes (BHs) and the feedback from AGN in cosmological simulations. Our model is
a substantially modified version of the one by Springel et al. (2005). Because
cosmological simulations lack both the resolution and the physics to model the
multiphase interstellar medium, they tend to strongly underestimate the
Bondi-Hoyle accretion rate. To allow low-mass BHs to grow, it is therefore
necessary to increase the predicted Bondi-Hoyle rates in dense gas by large,
ad-hoc factors. We explore the physical regimes where the use of such factors
is reasonable, and through this introduce a new prescription for gas accretion.
Feedback from AGN is modeled by coupling a fraction of the rest-mass energy of
the accreted gas thermally into the surrounding medium. We describe the
implementation as well as the limitations of the model and motivate all the
changes relative to previous work.
  We investigate the robustness of the predictions for the cosmic star
formation history, the redshift zero cosmic BH density, BH scaling relations,
and galaxy specific star formation rates. We find that the freedom introduced
by the need to increase the predicted accretion rates, the standard procedure
in the literature, is the most significant source of uncertainty. Our
simulations demonstrate that supermassive BHs are able to regulate their growth
by releasing a fixed amount of energy for a given halo mass, independent of the
assumed efficiency of AGN feedback, which sets the normalization of the BH
scaling relations. Regardless of whether BH seeds are initially placed above or
below the BH scaling relations they grow onto the same relations. AGN feedback
efficiently suppresses star formation in high-mass galaxies.

observations span 11.8 years of the binary's 14.2-year orbital period. We
determine a total dynamical mass of 0.146+/-0.014 MSun (153+/-15 MJup). Using
the combined observational constraints of the total mass and individual
luminosities, the Tucson (Lyon) evolutionary models give an age for the system
of 1.6 Gyr (1.8 Gyr), consistent with its space motion. We also use these
models to determine the mass ratio, giving individual masses of 0.0839+/-0.0011
MSun (0.0848+/-0.0011 MSun) for LHS 2397aA and 0.061+/-0.013 MSun
(0.060+/-0.010 MSun) for LHS 2397aB. Because LHS 2397aB is very close to the
theoretical mass-limit of lithium burning, measuring its lithium depletion
would uniquely test substellar models. We estimate a spectral type of L7+/-1
for LHS 2397aB, making it the first L/T transition object with a dynamical mass
determination. This enables a precise estimate of its effective temperature
from Tucson (Lyon) models of 1460+/-40 K (1440+/-40 K), which is 200 K higher
than estimates for young late-L companions but consistent with older late-L
field dwarfs, supporting the idea that the temperature of the L/T transition is
surface gravity dependent. Comparing our temperature estimate for LHS 2397aB to
those derived from spectral synthesis modeling for similar objects reveals
consistency between evolutionary and atmospheric models at the L/T transition,
despite the currently limited understanding of this phase of substellar
evolution. Future dynamical masses for L/T binaries spanning a range of surface
gravity and age will provide the next critical tests of substellar models at
the L/T transition.

  Homogenization with application to EIT",,,,,"math.AP math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a new geometric approach for the homogenization and inverse
homogenization of the divergence form elliptic operator with rough conductivity
coefficients $\sigma(x)$ in dimension two. We show that conductivity
coefficients are in one-to-one correspondence with divergence-free matrices and
convex functions $s(x)$ over the domain $\Omega$. Although homogenization is a
non-linear and non-injective operator when applied directly to conductivity
coefficients, homogenization becomes a linear interpolation operator over
triangulations of $\Omega$ when re-expressed using convex functions, and is a
volume averaging operator when re-expressed with divergence-free matrices.
Using optimal weighted Delaunay triangulations for linearly interpolating
convex functions, we obtain an optimally robust homogenization algorithm for
arbitrary rough coefficients. Next, we consider inverse homogenization and show
how to decompose it into a linear ill-posed problem and a well-posed non-linear
problem. We apply this new geometric approach to Electrical Impedance
Tomography (EIT). It is known that the EIT problem admits at most one isotropic
solution. If an isotropic solution exists, we show how to compute it from any
conductivity having the same boundary Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. It is known
that the EIT problem admits a unique (stable with respect to $G$-convergence)
solution in the space of divergence-free matrices. As such we suggest that the
space of convex functions is the natural space in which to parameterize
solutions of the EIT problem.

assuming that galaxy clusters are representative of the cosmic baryon budget,
the distribution of the cluster baryon fraction in the hottest (T> 4 keV)
systems as a function of redshift is used to constrain the cosmological
parameters. We discuss how our constraints are affected by several systematics,
namely the isothermality, the assumed baryon fraction in stars, the depletion
parameter and the sample selection. By using only the cluster baryon fraction
as a proxy for the cosmological parameters, we obtain that Omega is very well
constrained at the value of 0.35 with a relative statistical uncertainty of 11%
(1 sigma level; w=-1) and a further systematic error of about (-6,+7)%. On the
other hand, constraints on Lambda (without the prior of flat geometry) and w
(using the prior of flat geometry) are definitely weaker due to the presence of
larger statistical and systematic uncertainties (of the order of 40 per cent on
Lambda and larger than 50 per cent on w). If the WMAP 5-year best-fit results

expected from non-thermal pressure support and ICM clumpiness to be lower than

and inter-system aggression, we show how the coevolution of the system
parameters (degree of organization and conditions for aggression) depends on
the rate of supply of resources. The model consists of a number of units
grouped into systems that compete for the resource; within each system several
units can be aggregated into cooperative arrangements whose size is a measure
of the degree of organization in the system. Aggression takes place when the
systems release inhibitors that impair the performance of other systems. Using
a mean field approximation we show that i) even in the case of identical
systems there are stable inhomogeneous solutions, ii) a system steadily
producing inhibitors needs large perturbations to leave this regime, and iii)
aggression may give comparative advantages. A discrete model is used in order
to examine how the particular configuration of the units within a system
determines its performance in the presence of aggression. We find that
full-scale, one sided aggression is only profitable for less-organized systems,
and that systems with a mixture of degrees of organization exhibit robustness
against aggression. By using a genetic algorithm we find that, in terms of the
full-occupation resource supply rate, the coevolution of the set of systems
displays a variety of regimes. This kind of model can be useful to analyse the
interplay of the cooperation/competition processes that can be found in some
social, economic, ecological and biochemical systems; as an illustration we
refer to the competition between drug-selling gangs.

parametrized as having a power law dependence on gas column density, which
varies accross the sample and is in general steeper than ""Kennicutt-Schmidt""
law. The power law relation holds until one reaches the sensitivity limit of
the GALEX data, i.e. we find no evidence for a ""threshold density"" below which

lower-bounds the quantum query complexity of a function. We turn this lower
bound into an upper bound, by giving a quantum walk algorithm based on the dual
SDP that has query complexity at most the general adversary bound, up to a
logarithmic factor.
  In more detail, the proof has two steps, each based on ""span programs,"" a
certain linear-algebraic model of computation. First, we give an SDP that
outputs for any boolean function a span program computing it that has optimal
""witness size."" The optimal witness size is shown to coincide with the general
adversary lower bound. Second, we give a quantum algorithm for evaluating span
programs with only a logarithmic query overhead on the witness size.
  The first result is motivated by a quantum algorithm for evaluating composed
span programs. The algorithm is known to be optimal for evaluating a large
class of formulas. The allowed gates include all constant-size functions for
which there is an optimal span program. So far, good span programs have been
found in an ad hoc manner, and the SDP automates this procedure. Surprisingly,
the SDP's value equals the general adversary bound. A corollary is an optimal
quantum algorithm for evaluating ""balanced"" formulas over any finite boolean
gate set. The second result extends span programs' applicability beyond the
formula evaluation problem.
  A strong universality result for span programs follows. A good quantum query
algorithm for a problem implies a good span program, and vice versa. Although
nearly tight, this equivalence is nontrivial. Span programs are a promising
model for developing more quantum algorithms.

also be interpreted as minus the volume excluded from a spatial slice by the

formula. Since the cosmological constant is naturally thought of as a pressure,

dephasing of the inflatons that increases the effective mass of the matter

sub-dominant, we observe a slight enhancement of tachyonic preheating. Thus, in

holes that originate from single stars in different environments. In
particular, we calculate the dependence of maximum black hole mass on
metallicity and on some specific wind mass loss rates (e.g., Hurley et al. and
Vink et al.). Our calculations show that the highest mass black holes observed
in the Galaxy M_bh = 15 Msun in the high metallicity environment (Z=Zsun=0.02)
can be explained with stellar models and the wind mass loss rates adopted here.
To reach this result we had to set Luminous Blue Variable mass loss rates at
the level of about 0.0001 Msun/yr and to employ metallicity dependent
Wolf-Rayet winds. With such winds, calibrated on Galactic black hole mass
measurements, the maximum black hole mass obtained for moderate metallicity
(Z=0.3 Zsun=0.006) is M_bh,max = 30 Msun. This is a rather striking finding as
the mass of the most massive known stellar black hole is M_bh = 23-34 Msun and,
in fact, it is located in a small star forming galaxy with moderate
metallicity. We find that in the very low (globular cluster-like) metallicity
environment the maximum black hole mass can be as high as M_bh,max = 80 Msun
(Z=0.01 Zsun=0.0002). It is interesting to note that X-ray luminosity from
Eddington limited accretion onto an 80 Msun black hole is of the order of about
10^40 erg/s and is comparable to luminosities of some known ULXs. We emphasize
that our results were obtained for single stars only and that binary
interactions may alter these maximum black hole masses (e.g., accretion from a
close companion). This is strictly a proof-of-principle study which
demonstrates that stellar models can naturally explain even the most massive
known stellar black holes.

observations of compact accreting sources has recently been identified. Such a
relation suggests that X-ray lightcurves are non-linear and composed of a
lognormal distribution of fluxes. Here, a first investigation of the optical
rms vs. flux behavior in X-ray binaries is presented. Fast timing data on three
binaries in the X-ray low/hard state are examined. These are XTE J1118+480, GX
339-4 and SWIFT J1753.5-0127 -- all show aperiodic (non-reprocessed) optical
fluctuation components. Optical rms amplitude is found to increase with flux in
all sources. A linear fit results in a positive offset along the flux axis, for
most frequency ranges investigated. The X-ray and optical relation slopes track
the source fractional variability amplitudes. This is especially clear in the
case of GX 339-4, which has the largest optical variance of the three targets.
Non-linearity is supported in all cases by the fact that flux distributions of
the optical lightcurves are better described with a lognormal function than a
simple gaussian. Significant scatter around linearity is found in the relation
for the two sources with lower optical variability amplitude, though
observational biases may well contribute to this. Implications for accretion
models are discussed, and the need for long well-sampled optical lightcurves is
emphasized.

regularize the chaotic motions on the synchronization manifold. We explore both
time dependent and time independent coupling. We also examine both optimized

dependent coupling function u(t) we find a robust structure which includes
sharp peaks and intervals where it is zero. This structure shows a strong
correlation with the location in phase space and appears to depend on noise,

It is shown that the $\pi$-tangles for the X- and Z-noisy channels vanish at
$\kappa t \to \infty$ limit, where $\kappa t$ is a parameter introduced in the
master equation of Lindblad form. In this limit the receiver's maximum fidelity
reduces to the classical limit 2/3. However, this nice feature is not
maintained at the Y- and isotropy-noise channels. For Y-noise channel the
$\pi$-tangle vanishes at $0.61 \leq \kappa t$. At $\kappa t = 0.61$ the
receiver's maximum fidelity becomes 0.57, which is much less than the classical
limit. Similar phenomenon occurs at the isotropic noise channel. We also
computed the three-tangles analytically for the X- and Z-noise channels. The
remarkable fact is that the three-tangle for Z-noise channel is exactly same
with the corresponding $\pi$-tangle. In the X-noise channel the three-tangle
vanishes at $0.10 \leq \kappa t$. At $\kappa t = 0.10$ the receiver's fidelity
can be reduced to the classical limit provided that the accomplice performs the
measurement appropriately. However, the receiver's maximum fidelity becomes
8/9, which is much larger than the classical limit. Since the Y- and
isotropy-noise channels are rank-8 mixed states, their three-tangles are not
computed explicitly. Instead, we have derived their upper bounds with use of
the analytical three-tangles for other noisy channels. Our analysis strongly
suggests that we need different three-party entanglement measure whose value is
between three-tangle and $\pi$-tangle.

hybrid-type potential. Radiation raised continuously by a dissipating inflaton
field keeps symmetry restoration in a remote sector, and the false-vacuum
energy of the remote sector dominates the energy density during inflation.
Remote inflation is terminated when the temperature reaches the critical
temperature, or when the slow-roll condition is violated. Without introducing a
complex form of couplings, inflaton field may either roll-in (like a standard
hybrid inflation) or roll-out (like an inverted-hybrid model or quintessential
inflation) on arbitrary inflaton potential. Significant signatures of remote
inflation can be observed in the spectrum caused by (1) the inhomogeneous phase
transition in the remote sector, or (2) a successive phase transition in the
remote sector. Remote inflation can predict strong amplification or suppression
of small-scale perturbations without introducing multiple inflation. Since the
inflaton may have a run-away potential, it is also possible to identify the
inflaton with quintessence, without introducing additional mechanisms. Even if
the false-vacuum energy is not dominated by the remote sector, the phase
transition in the remote sector is possible during warm inflation, which may
cause significant amplification/suppression of the curvature perturbations.

are investigated. By using the tight-binding model and the non-equilibrium
Green's function method, the expressions of the current, conductance, normal
tunneling coefficient, and Andreev reflection coefficient are obtained. For a
clean system and at zero magnetic field, the linear conductance increases
approximatively in a linear fashion with the on-site energy. In the presence of
a magnetic field and a moderate disorder, the linear conductance exhibits
plateau structures for both armchair and zigzag edges. The plateau values
increase with the width of the graphene ribbon. With a wide sample width, a
saturated plateau value of $|\nu|e^2/h$ emerges at the filling factor $\nu$.
For a small filling factor, the conductance can reach the saturated value at a
small width, but for a high filling factor, it requires to have a quite wide
sample width to reach the saturated value. In particular, the Andreev
reflection coefficient is always at 0.5 after reaching the saturated value,
independent of any system parameters. In addition, we also consider the finite
bias case, in which the Andreev reflection coefficient and normal tunneling

2009 X-ray minimum. In the accretion model the secondary star accretes mass
from the primary wind near periastron passage, a process that suppresses the
secondary wind. As the shocked secondary wind is responsible for most of the
X-ray emission, the accretion process accounts for the X-ray minimum. The early
exit from the 2009 X-ray minimum after four weeks, instead of ten weeks as in
the two previous minima, is attributed to the primary wind that during the last
minimum was somewhat faster and of lower mass loss rate than during the two
previous X-ray minima. This results in a much lower mass accretion rate during
the X-ray minimum. We show that using fluctuations in these quantities that are
within the range deduced from fluctuations in the X-ray flux outside the
minimum, can account for the short duration of the last X-ray minimum. The
shorter X-ray minimum may have further implications on the recovery of the
system from the spectroscopic event.

considered. Based on simulations it is argued that there is a tendency for the
field to become more diffuse and non-intermittent as the dynamo saturates. The
simulations are idealized in that the turbulence is strongly helical and shear
is strong, so the tendency for the field to become more diffuse is somewhat
exaggerated. Earlier results concerning the effects of magnetic buoyancy are
discussed. It is emphasized that the resulting magnetic buoyancy is weak

a distributed fashion where the near-surface shear layer could play an

interactions by comparing galaxies in pairs with isolated galaxies.
  However, different authors have proposed different ways to build these
so-called control samples (CS). By using mock galaxy catalogues of the SDSS-DR4
built up from the Millennium Simulation, we explore how the way of building a
CS might introduce biases which could affect the interpretation of results. We
make use of the fact that the physics of interactions is not included in the
semianalytic model, to infer that any difference between the mock control and
pair samples can be ascribed to selection biases. Thus, we find that galaxies
in pairs artificially tend to be older and more bulge-dominated, and to have
less cold gas and different metallicities than their isolated counterparts.
Also because of a biased selection, galaxies in pairs tend to live in higher
density environments, and in haloes of larger masses. We find that imposing
constraints on redshift, stellar masses and local densities diminishes the
selection biases by ~70%. Based on these findings, we suggest observers how to
build an unique and unbiased CS in order to reveal the effect of galaxy
interactions.

this purpose, we perform a comparative study of galaxies with and without close

removing sources of possible biases. We find that at low and high local density
environments, colours and morphologies of close galaxy pairs are very similar
to those of isolated galaxies. At intermediate densities, we detect significant
differences, indicating that close pairs could have experienced a more rapid
transition onto the red sequence than isolated galaxies. The presence of a
correlation between colours and morphologies indicates that the physical
mechanism responsible for the colour transformation also operates changing
galaxy morphologies. Regardless of dark matter halo mass, we show that the
percentage of red galaxies in close pairs and in the control sample are
comparable at low and high local density environments. However, at intermediate
local densities, the gap in the red fraction between close pairs and the
control galaxies increases from ~10% in low mass haloes up to ~50% in the most
massive ones. Our findings suggest that in intermediate density environments
galaxies are efficiently pre-processed by close encounters and mergers before

observed at RHIC in high centrality heavy ion collisions is due to the imprint
of semihard DGLAP gluon radiation from initial-state partons which have
transverse momenta biased toward the trigger. Rescattering interactions from
gluon-exchange, normally neglected in the parton model, have a profound effect
in QCD hard-scattering reactions, leading to leading-twist single-spin
asymmetries, diffractive deep inelastic scattering, diffractive hard hadronic
reactions, the breakdown of the Lam-Tung relation in Drell-Yan reactions,
nuclear shadowing --all leading-twist dynamics not incorporated in the
