fermion-fermion-Higgs interactions generated by dimension-six gauge-invariant
effective operators. After removing redundant operators it is found that the
most general H f_i f_j vertex for off-shell fermions f_i, f_j and an off-shell
Higgs boson only involves scalar and pseudo-scalar terms, without derivatives.
Examples are presented for the Htt and Htq interactions, where q=u,c, giving
the explicit expressions of the vertices in terms of gauge-invariant operators.
The new operator equalities obtained here also reduce the number of operators
relevant for the Ztq vertices, although the general form of these interactions
is not simplified with respect to previous results.

  Weinberg","Pricing Randomized Allocations",,,,,"cs.GT cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Randomized mechanisms, which map a set of bids to a probability distribution
over outcomes rather than a single outcome, are an important but ill-understood
area of computational mechanism design. We investigate the role of randomized
outcomes (henceforth, ""lotteries"") in the context of a fundamental and
archetypical multi-parameter mechanism design problem: selling heterogeneous
items to unit-demand bidders. To what extent can a seller improve her revenue
by pricing lotteries rather than items, and does this modification of the
problem affect its computational tractability? Our results show that the
answers to these questions hinge on whether consumers can purchase only one
lottery (the buy-one model) or purchase any set of lotteries and receive an
independent sample from each (the buy-many model). In the buy-one model, there
is a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the revenue-maximizing envy-free
prices (thus overcoming the inapproximability of the corresponding item pricing
problem) and the revenue of the optimal lottery system can exceed the revenue
of the optimal item pricing by an unbounded factor as long as the number of
item types exceeds 4. In the buy-many model with n item types, the profit
achieved by lottery pricing can exceed item pricing by a factor of O(log n) but
not more, and optimal lottery pricing cannot be approximated within a factor of
O(n^eps) for some eps>0, unless NP has subexponential-time randomized
algorithms. Our lower bounds rely on a mixture of geometric and algebraic
techniques, whereas the upper bounds use a novel rounding scheme to transform a
mechanism with randomized outcomes into one with deterministic outcomes while
losing only a bounded amount of revenue.

higher metallicities observed in sub-DLAs are indicative of higher host galaxy
masses. We discuss the various problems that this interpretation encounters and
conclude that in general sub-DLAs are not uniquely synonymous with massive
galaxies. We rule out physically related sources of bias (dust, environment,
ionization effects) and examine systematics associated with the selection and
analysis of low-redshift sub-DLAs. We propose that the high metallicities of
sub-DLAs at z<1.7 that drives an apparently steep evolution may be due to the
selection of most low-redshift sub-DLAs based on their high MgII equivalent
widths.

combined effects of rotation and tidal forces due to a companion star. We also

analyze the eclipsing binary system EK Cep, reproducing the stellar radii,
effective temperature ratio, lithium depletion, rotational velocities, and the

not to be fully justified, although it is widely used when analyzing the

is that game theory's expected utility and dominance principles appear to
provide conflicting recommendations for what you should choose. A recent
extension of game theory provides a powerful tool for resolving paradoxes
concerning human choice, which formulates such paradoxes in terms of Bayes
nets. Here we apply this to ol to Newcomb's scenario. We show that the
conflicting recommendations in Newcomb's scenario use different Bayes nets to
relate your choice and the algorithm's prediction. These two Bayes nets are
incompatible. This resolves the paradox: the reason there appears to be two
conflicting recommendations is that the specification of the underlying Bayes
net is open to two, conflicting interpretations. We then show that the accuracy
of the prediction algorithm in Newcomb's paradox, the focus of much previous
work, is irrelevant. We similarly show that the utility functions of you and

type $A_2^{(1)}$). We solve the recurrence relations among the coefficients of
$\myAA$ (which form a Y--system of type $A_2^{(1)}$). In $\myAA$ there is a
natural notion of positivity. We find linear bases $\BB$ of $\myAA$ such that
positive linear combinations of elements of $\BB$ coincide with the cone of
positive elements. We call these bases \emph{atomic bases} of $\myAA$. These
are the analogue of the ""canonical bases"" found by Sherman and Zelevinsky in
type $A_{1}^{(1)}$. Every atomic basis consists of cluster monomials together
with extra elements. We provide explicit expressions for the elements of such
bases in every cluster. We prove that the elements of $\BB$ are parameterized
by $\ZZ^3$ via their $\mathbf{g}$--vectors in every cluster. We prove that the
denominator vector map in every acyclic seed of $\myAA$ restricts to a
bijection between $\BB$ and $\ZZ^3$. In particular this gives an explicit
algorithm to determine the ""virtual"" canonical decomposition of every element
of the root lattice of type $A_2^{(1)}$. We find explicit recurrence relations
to express every element of $\myAA$ as linear combinations of elements of
$\BB$.

pre-specified noise level. We then derive the corresponding conditional
density, P(alpha | s, Cl, d), which is subsequently integrated into a general
CMB Gibbs sampler. We first verify our code by analyzing simulated data sets,
and then apply the framework to the WMAP data. For the foreground-reduced
5-year WMAP sky maps and the nominal noise levels initially provided in the
5-year data release, we find that the posterior means typically range between
alpha=1.005 +- 0.001 and alpha=1.010 +- 0.001 depending on differencing
assembly, indicating that the noise level of these maps are biased low by
0.5-1.0%. The same problem is not observed for the uncorrected WMAP sky maps.
After the preprint version of this letter appeared on astro-ph., the WMAP team
has corrected the values presented on their web page, noting that the initially
provided values were in fact estimates from the 3-year data release, not from
the 5-year estimates. However, internally in their 5-year analysis the correct
noise values were used, and no cosmological results are therefore compromised
by this error. Thus, our method has already been demonstrated in practice to be
both useful and accurate.

thermodynamic Monte Carlo methods, and algorithms for kMC simulations,
including parallel ones, are discussed in some detail. The step from the
atomistic picture to the more coarse-grained description of Monte Carlo
simulations is exemplified for the case of surface diffusion. Here, the aim is
the derivation of rate constants from knowledge about the underlying atomic
processes. Both the simple approach of Transition State Theory, as well as more
recent approaches using accelerated molecular dynamics are reviewed. Finally, I
address the point that simplifications often need to be introduced in practical
Monte Carlo simulations in order to reduce the complexity of 'real' atomic
processes. Different 'flavors' of kMC simulations and the potential pitfalls
related to the reduction of complexity are presented in the context of
simulations of epitaxial growth.

codes can be described in terms of the stabilizer of the codewords. The
stabilizer is a finite Abelian group, and allows a straightforward
characterization of the error-correcting properties of the code. The stabilizer
formalism for quantum codes also illustrates the relationships to classical
coding theory, particularly classical codes over GF(4), the finite field with

prograde exomoon orbits, and deductive for retrograde orbits. This asymmetry
could allow for future determination of the orbital sense of motion. We
re-evaluate the ratio of TDV and TTV effects, $\eta$, in the more general case
of an inclined planetary orbit with a circular orbiting moon and find that it
is still possible to directly determine the moon's orbital separation from just
the ratio of the two amplitudes, as first proposed in our previous paper.

X-ray luminous elliptical galaxy NGC4636, located in the outskirts of the Virgo

the center surrounded by an extended X-ray corona and two pronounced
quasi-symmetric, 8 kpc long, arm-like features. Each of this features defines
the rim of an ellipsoidal bubble. An additional bubble-like feature, whose
northern rim is located ~2 kpc south of the north-eastern arm, is detected as
well. We present surface brightness and temperature profiles across the rims of
the bubbles, showing that their edges are sharp and characterized by
temperature jumps of about 20-25%. Through a comparison of the observed
profiles with theoretical shock models, we demonstrate that a scenario where
the bubbles were produced by shocks, probably driven by energy deposited
off-center by jets, is the most viable explanation to the X-ray morphology
observed in the central part of NGC4636. As a confirmation to this scenario,
radio jets extending towards the bubbles and a central weak X-ray and radio
source are detected and are most likely the signs of AGN activity which was
more intense in the past. A bright dense core of ~1 kpc radius is observed at
the center of NGC4636. A sharp decline in surface brightness from the core to
the ambient gas is observed and is not accompanied by a variation in the
temperature and thus could not be in thermal pressure equilibrium. However the
bright core could be a long lived feature if the radio jets are acting as a
balancing factor to thermal pressure or if the bright core is produced by steep
abundance gradients.

generic black-hole binary is of great importance for studying the cosmological
evolution of supermassive black holes. Several attempts have been made to model
the spin via simple expressions exploiting the results of numerical-relativity
simulations. While these expressions are in reasonable agreement with the
simulations, they neglect the precession of the binary's orbital plane, and
cannot therefore be applied directly -- i.e., without evolving the system to
small separations using post-Newtonian theory -- to binaries with separations
larger than a few hundred gravitational radii. While not a problem in
principle, this may be impractical if the formulas are employed in cosmological
merger-trees or N-body simulations, which provide the spins and angular
momentum of the two black holes when their separation is of hundreds or
thousands of gravitational radii. The formula that we propose is instead built
on improved assumptions and gives, for any separation, a very accurate
prediction both for the norm of the final spin and for its direction. By
comparing with the numerical data, we also show that the final-spin direction
is very accurately aligned with the binary's total angular momentum at large
separation. Hence, observations of the final-spin direction (e.g. via a jet)
can provide information on the binary's orbital plane at large separations and
could be relevant, for instance, for studying X-shaped radio sources.

gradient, or concentration index, to investigate how AGN activity is related
with galaxy properties. The AGN sample is composed of Type II AGNs identified
with flux ratios of narrow-emission lines with S/N > 6. We find that the
fraction of galaxies hosting an AGN (f_AGN) depends strongly on morphology
together with color, and very weakly on luminosity or velocity dispersion of
host galaxies. In particular, f_AGN of early-type galaxies is almost
independent of luminosity nor velocity dispersion when color is fixed. The host
galaxy color preferred by AGNs is u-r ~2.0 for early-type hosts and u-r=2.0-2.4
for late-type hosts. This trend suggests that AGNs are dominantly hosted by
intermediate-mass late-type galaxies. We also investigate how the accretion
power varies with galaxy properties. While the Eddington ratio ([OIII] line
luminosity normalized by black hole mass) ranges over three orders of magnitude
for both morphological types, late-type galaxies are the dominant hosts over
all AGN power. Among late-type galaxies, bluer color galaxies host higher power
AGNs. These results are consistent with a scenario that more massive and redder
galaxies are harder to host AGNs since these galaxiesalready consumed gas at
the center or do not have sufficient gas supply to feed the black hole. In
contrast, intermediate-mass, intermediate-color, and more concentrated
late-type galaxies are more likely to host AGNs, implying that perhaps some
fraction of low-mass, blue, and less concentrated lat e-type galaxiesmay not
host massive black holes or may host very low-power AGNs.

pure NE after Rosen [3]. Then, as the relay can also optimize several

the leader of a Stackelberg game where the information sources are the
followers. Our theoretical analysis is illustrated by simulations giving more

generation of surveys will probe a huge range of astronomical objects and

as well as that of first order transitions, which encapsulate in the form of a
generalized static fluctuation dissipation relation. This will help determine
three classes of distributions, which are, by defining a Hurst exponent for the
relaxation rate: the regular Maxwell-Boltzmann for all H < 1/2; the usual scale
free universal distributions with power law tails for H in ]1/2,1]; and a new
class. The latter lies in the intermediate case, when H = 1/2. The distribution
functions are scale free close to the origin, and cross-over to a
Maxwell-Boltzmann asymptotic behavior, with both the scaling exponent and an
effective temperature that depend on the magnitude of the intrinsic disorder.

photographic film determine the stereo representation of an object point. Since
the wavelength may have any value within the continuous visible spectrum, this

added from the side of the developed photographic film. One white light ray
that matches the former position of an incident ray receives the spectral
characteristics of the registered point when traversing the photographic slide.
It characterizes a situation of light path reversal, and the ideal result

superconductivity in the iron pnictides adopting the five-band models of
several virtual lattice structures of LaFeAsO as well as actual materials such
as NdFeAsO and LaFePO obtained from the maximally-localized Wannier orbitals.
Random phase approximation is applied to the models to solve the Eliashberg
equation. This reveals that the gap function and the strength of the
superconducting instability are determined by the cooperation or competition
among multiple spin fluctuation modes arising from several nestings among
disconnected pieces of the Fermi surface, which is affected by the lattice
structure. Specifically, the appearance of the Fermi surface $\gamma$ around
$(\pi,\pi)$ in the unfolded Brillouin zone is sensitive to the pnictogen height
$h_{\rm Pn}$ measured from the Fe plane, where $h_{\rm Pn}$ is shown to act as
a switch between high-$T_c$ nodeless and low-$T_c$ nodal pairings. We also find
that reduction of the lattice constants generally suppresses superconductivity.
We can then combine these to obtain a generic superconducting phase diagram
against the pnictogen height and lattice constant. This suggests that NdFeAsO
is expected to exhibit a fully-gapped, sign-reversing s-wave superconductivity
with a higher $T_c$ than in LaFeAsO, while a nodal pairing with a low $T_c$ is
expected for LaFePO, which is consistent with experiments.

black hole mass in quiescent or active galaxies is presented and it is argued
that the use of mass-scaling relations is both a reliable and the preferred
method to apply to large samples of distant quasars. The method uses
spectroscopic measurements of a broad emission-line width and continuum
luminosity and currently has a statistical 1 sigma uncertainty in the absolute
mass values of about a factor of 4. Potentially, this accuracy can be improved
in the future. When applied to large samples of distant quasars it is evident
that the black hole masses are very large, of order 1 to 10 billion solar
masses, even at the highest redshifts of 4 to 6. The black holes must build up
their mass very fast in the early universe. Yet they do not grow much larger
than that: a maximum mass of about 10 billion solar masses is also observed.
Preliminary mass functions of active black holes are presented for several
quasar samples, including the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Finally, common
concerns related to the application of the mass scaling relations, especially
for high redshift quasars, are briefly discussed.

quantification because of their simplicity and model independence. But they
may, particularly for reversible kinetics, lead to bias in the estimated
parameters. The source of the bias is commonly attributed to noise in the data.
Assuming a two-tissue compartmental model, we investigate the bias that
originates from model error. This bias is an intrinsic property of the
simplified linear models used for limited scan durations, and it is exaggerated
by random noise and numerical quadrature error. Conditions are derived under
which Logan's graphical method either over- or under-estimates the distribution
volume in the noise-free case. The bias caused by model error is quantified
analytically. The presented analysis shows that the bias of graphical methods
is inversely proportional to the dissociation rate. Furthermore, visual
examination of the linearity of the Logan plot is not sufficient for
guaranteeing that equilibrium has been reached. A new model which retains the

of biochemical and physiological processes from Positron emission tomography

bias in the estimated parameters. We recently systematically evaluated the bias
associated with the linear model approximation and developed an alternative to
minimize the bias due to model error. In this study, we examined the noise
structure in the equations defining linear quantification methods, including
LGA. The noise structure conflicts with the conditions given by the
Gauss-Markov theorem for the least squares (LS) solution to generate the best
linear unbiased estimator. By carefully taking care of the data error
structure, we propose to use structured total least squares (STLS) to obtain
the solution using a one-dimensional optimization problem. Simulations of PET

the proposed method significantly reduces the bias. We conclude that the bias
associated with noise is primarily due to the unusual structure of he

which the non-classical rotational inertia (NCRI) phenomenon observed in the
torsional oscillator experiments of Kim and Chan, is evidence for a
Bose-condensed supersolid state with superfluid-like properties. In an open
annular geometry, Kim and Chan found that a fraction of the solid moment of
inertia is decoupled from the motion of the oscillator; however, when the
annulus is blocked by a partition, the decoupled supersolid fraction is locked
to the oscillator being accelerated by an AC pressure gradient generated by the
moving partition. These observations are in accord with superfluid
hydrodynamics. We apply a low frequency AC pressure gradient in order to search
for a superfluid-like response in a supersolid sample. Our results are
consistent with zero supersolid flow in response to the imposed low frequency
pressure gradient. A statistical analysis of our data sets a bound, at the 68%
confidence level, of 9.6$\times 10^{-4}$ nm/s for the mass transport velocity
carried by a possible supersolid flow. In terms of a simple model for the
supersolid, an upper bound of 3.3$\times 10^{-6}$ is set for the supersolid
fraction at 25 mK, at this same confidence level. These findings force the
conclusion that the NCRI observed in the torsional oscillator experiments is
not evidence for a frequency independent superfluid-like state. Supersolid
behavior is a frequency-dependent phenomenon, clearly evident in the frequency
range of the torsional oscillator experiments, but undetectably small at
frequencies approaching zero.

$f_{NL}$ and the trispectrum is characterized by two parameters $\tau_{NL}$ and
$g_{NL}$. For simplicity, the trajectory of inflaton is assumed to be a
straight line in the field space and then the entropic perturbations do not
contribute to the curvature perturbation during inflation. As long as the
background inflaton path is not orthogonal to the hyper-surface for inflation
to end, the entropic perturbation can make a contribution to the curvature
perturbation at the end of inflation and a large local-type non-Gaussiantiy is
expected. An interesting thing is that the non-Gaussianity parameters are
completely determined by the geometric properties of the hyper-surface of the

curve on this hyper-surface along the adiabatic direction and $g_{NL}$ is
related to the change of the curvature radius per unit arc-length of this

how quantum information is elaborated during the execution of quantum circuits.
This introductory tutorial illustrates the basics, providing useful examples of
quantum computations: elementary operations in single-qubit, two-qubit and
three-qubit systems, immersions of gates on higher dimensional spaces,
generation of single and multi-qubit states, procedures to synthesize unitary,
controlled and diagonal matrices. To perform the analysis of quantum processes,
we directly derive diagrams of states from physical implementations of quantum
circuits associated to the processes. Complete diagrams are then rearranged
into simplified diagrams, to visualize the overall effects of computations.
Conversely, diagrams of states help to conceive new quantum algorithms, by
schematically describing desired manipulations of quantum information with
intuitive diagrams and then by guessing the equivalent complete diagrams, from
which the corresponding quantum circuit is obtained effortlessly. Related
examples and analysis of complex algorithms will be provided in future works,
for whose comprehension this first tutorial offers the necessary introduction.

relativistic shock precursor through micro-instabilities. The level of
magnetization of the upstream plasma turns out to be a crucial parameter,
notably because the length scale of the shock precursor is limited by the
Larmor rotation of the accelerated particles in the background magnetic field
and by the speed of the shock wave. We discuss in detail and calculate the
growth rates of the following beam plasma instabilities seeded by the
accelerated and reflected particle populations: for an unmagnetized shock, the
Weibel and filamentation instabilities, as well as the Cerenkov resonant
longitudinal and oblique modes; for a magnetized shock, the Weibel instability
and the resonant Cerenkov instabilities with the longitudinal electrostatic
modes, as well as the Alfven, Whisler and extraordinary modes. All these
instabilities are generated upstream, then they are transmitted downstream. The
modes excited by Cerenkov resonant instabilities take on particular importance
with respect to the magnetisation of the downstream medium since, being plasma
eigenmodes, they have a longer lifetime than the Weibel modes. We discuss the
main limitation of the wave growth associated with the length of the precursor
and the magnetisation of the upstream medium for both oblique and parallel
shock waves. We also characterize the proper conditions to obtain Fermi
acceleration. We recover some results of most recent particle-in-cell
simulations and conclude with some applications to astrophysical cases of
interest, pulsar winds and gamma-ray burst external shock waves in particular.

(half-space) plasma and an ideal plasma slab by using a general, unifying
procedure, based on equations of motion, Maxwell's equations and suitable
boundary conditions. Known results are re-obtained in much a more direct manner
and new ones are derived. The approach consists of representing the charge
disturbances by a displacement field in the positions of the moving particles
(electrons). The dielectric response and the electron energy loss are computed.
The surface contribution to the energy loss exhibits an oscillatory behaviour
in the transient regime near the surfaces. The propagation of an
electromagnetic wave in these plasmas is treated by using the retarded
electromagnetic potentials. The resulting integral equations are solved and the
reflected and refracted waves are computed, as well as the reflection
coefficient. For the slab we compute also the transmitted wave and the
transmission coefficient. Generalized Fresnel's relations are thereby obtained
for any incidence angle and polarization. Bulk and surface plasmon-polariton
modes are identified. As it is well known, the field inside the plasma is
either damped (evanescent) or propagating (transparency regime), and the
reflection coefficient for a semi-infinite plasma exhibits an abrupt
enhancement on passing from the propagating regime to the damped one (total
reflection). Similarly, apart from characteristic oscillations, the reflection
and transmission coefficients for a plasma slab exhibit an appreciable
enhancement in the damped regime.

small when mass inflation does occur. Then, a full non-linear numerical study

the full power of $b$--tagging will not be available. The MPI background turns
out to be small but non negligible, of the order of 20% of the background

analyze the possibility of studying Multiple Parton Interactions in the W+4j

two energetic jets which balance in transverse momentum, and it appears
possible, thanks to the good angular resolution of ATLAS and CMS, to separate
the Multiple Parton Interactions contribution from Single Parton Interaction

Triple Parton Interactions (TPI) could provide a non negligible contribution.

Results. We explore an emerging dipole locating at the CH boundary. Mini-scale

II H line. During the separation of the dipolar footpoints, three AFs appeared
and expanded in turn. The first AF divided into two segments in its late stage,
while the second and third AFs erupted in their late stages. The lifetimes of
these three AFs are 4, 6, 10 minutes, and the two intervals between the three

Several interesting conclusions have been drawn: (a) if the desired resolution

exactly bymeasurements, which is comparable to the required number of
measurement by the Gaussian random matrix in the literatures of compressive
sensing. (b) With incorporating the random media which is used to enforce the

incoherence with wavelet matrix, in other words, when the probed obstacles are
sparse with the framework of wavelet, the required number of measurements for
successful reconstruction is similar as above. (c) If the expected resolution

incorporates at its foundation the so-called separability principle of
classical physics. In view of the systematic violation of the latter within
quantum mechanics, the claim that contemporary physical science may posit
non-supervenient relations beyond the spatiotemporal ones is reinforced on a
foundational basis concerning constraints on the state-representation of
physical systems. Depending on the mode of assignment of states to physical
systems, unit state vectors versus statistical density operators, we
distinguish between strongly and weakly non-Humean, non-supervenient relations.
It is demonstrated that in either case the relations of quantum entanglement
constitute prototypical examples of irreducible physical relations that do not
supervene upon a spatiotemporal arrangement of Humean qualities, weakening,
thereby, the thesis of Humean supervenience. It is examined, in this respect,
the status of Lewis' recombination principle, whereas his conception of lawhood
is critically investigated. It is concluded that the assumption of ontological
reductionism, as expressed in Lewis' Humean doctrine, cannot be regarded as a
reliable code of the nature of the physical world and its contents. It is
proposed instead that, due to the undeniable existence of non-supervenient
relations, a metaphysic of relations of a moderate kind ought to be
acknowledged as an indispensable part of our understanding of the natural world
at a fundamental level.

arising from laser-cluster interactions with focus on nonlinear optical

an excursion in theoretical and experimental methods, results for single- and

angular resolved photoemission. A key issue of this review is the broad
spectrum of phenomena arising from clusters exposed to strong fields, where the
interaction with the laser pulse creates short-lived and dense nanoplasmas. The
implications for technical developments include the controlled generation of

metallicities of the target stars on the [Fe/H] scale of Carretta & Gratton, as
well as on a scale tied to the global metal abundance, [M/H].
  The metallicity distribution function for LeoI stars is confirmed to be very
narrow, with mean value [M/H]~-1.2 and intrinsic dispersion, sigma_[M/H]=0.08.
We find a few metal-poor stars (whose metallicity values depend on the adopted
extrapolation of the existing calibrations), but in no case are stars more
metal-poor than [Fe/H]=-2.6.
  Our measurements provide a hint of a shallow metallicity gradient of -0.27
dex/Kpc among LeoI red giants.
  By combining the metallicities of the target stars with their photometric
data, we provide age estimates and an age-metallicity relation for a subset of
red giant stars in LeoI. Our age estimates indicate a rapid initial enrichment,
a slowly rising metal abundance and an increase of ~0.2 dex in the last few
Gyr.

the efficiency of content distribution and distributed storage. However, these
systems are particularly susceptible to Byzantine attacks. We quantify the
impact of Byzantine attacks on the coded system by evaluating the probability
that a receiver node fails to correctly recover a file. We show that even for a
small probability of attack, the system fails with overwhelming probability. We
then propose a novel signature scheme that allows packet-level Byzantine
detection. This scheme allows one-hop containment of the contamination, and
saves bandwidth by allowing nodes to detect and drop the contaminated packets.
We compare the net cost of our signature scheme with various other Byzantine
schemes, and show that when the probability of Byzantine attacks is high, our
scheme is the most bandwidth efficient.

Our prime motivation to detect faint radio emission at very low frequencies due
to low energy electrons.
  Our results provide evidence that there exists two classes of sources on
morphological grounds. The first class is explained by the simple picture of
spectral electron ageing but in the second class the low-frequency synchrotron
emission fades (nearly) as rapidly as high-frequency synchrotron emission. In
addition, in several sources, the spectra of low-surface-brightness features
are flatter than the spectra of high-surface-brightness features, which
suggests that either the simple picture of spectral electron ageing needs
revision or we need to re-examine the formation mechanism of such sources.
  The images and statistics, and the relevance of these results along with the
role of GMRT in exploring several unknowns are presented.

events (Merritt & Ekers 2002). Based on morphological and spectral
characteristics of these sources, currently a strong contender to explain the
nature of these sources is the `alternative' model of Lal & Rao (2007), in
which these sources consist of two pairs of jets, which are associated with two
unresolved AGNs. Detailed morphological and spectral results on
milliarcsecond-scales (mas) provide a crucial test of this model, and hence
these sources are excellent candidates to study on mas; {\it i.e.}, to detect
he presence/absence of double nuclei/AGNs, signs of helical/disrupted jets,
thereby, to investigate spatially resolved/unresolved binary AGN systems and
providing clues to understanding the physics of merging of AGNs on mas. We
conducted a systematic study of a large sample of known X-shaped, comparison FR
II radio galaxies, and newly discovered X-shaped candidate sources using Giant
Metrewave Radio Telescope and Very Large Array at several radio frequencies. In
our new observations of `comparison' FR II radio galaxies we find that almost
all of our targets show standard spectral steepening as a function of distance
from the hotspot. However, one source, 3C 321, has a low-surface-brightness
extension that shows a flatter spectral index than the high-surface-brightness
hotspots$ / $lobes, as found in `known' X-shaped sources.

ones producing approximate values, have too high a time and/or space complexity
to be used in such cases. We propose here a new approach relying on very simple
and fast algorithms that compute (upper and lower) bounds for the diameter. We
show empirically that, on various real-world cases representative of complex
networks studied in the literature, the obtained bounds are very tight (and
even equal in some cases). This leads to rigorous and very accurate estimations
of the actual diameter in cases which were previously untractable in practice.

relaxation in the Vlasov regime leading to a (usually) non-Boltzmannian quasi
stationary state (QSS), followed by a slow collisional relaxation leading to
the Boltzmann statistical equilibrium state. These two regimes can be explained
by a kinetic theory, using an expansion of the BBGKY hierarchy in powers of
1/N, where N is the number of particles. We discuss the physical meaning of the
different functionals appearing in the analysis: the Boltzmann entropy, the
Lynden-Bell entropy, the ""generalized"" entropies arising in the reduced space
of coarse-grained distribution functions, the Tsallis entropy, the generalized
H-functions increasing during violent relaxation (not necessarily
monotonically) and the convex Casimir functionals used to settle the formal
nonlinear dynamical stability of steady states of the Vlasov equation. We show
the connection between the different variational problems associated with these
functionals. We also introduce a general class of nonlinear mean field
Fokker-Planck (NFP) equations that can be used as numerical algorithms to solve
these constrained optimization problems.
