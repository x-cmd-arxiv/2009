matter structures along the line-of-sight and the stellar mass in galaxies
affect strong cluster lensing, in particular the cross-section for giant arcs.
Furthermore, we investigate the distribution of the cluster Einstein radii and
the radial distribution of giant arcs. We find that additional structures along
the line-of-sight increase the strong-lensing optical depth by ~10-25%, while
strong-lensing cross-sections of individual clusters are frequently boosted by
as much as ~50%. The enhancement is mainly due to structures that are not
correlated with the lens. Cluster galaxies increase the strong-lensing optical
depth by up to a factor of 2, while interloping galaxies are not significant.
We conclude that these effects need to be taken into account for predictions of
the giant arc abundance, but they are not large enough to fully account for the
reported discrepancy between predicted and observed abundances. Furthermore, we
find that Einstein radii defined via the area enclosed by the critical curve
are 10-30% larger than those defined via radial surface mass density profiles.
The contributions of radial and tangential arcs to the radial distribution of
arcs can be clearly distinguished. The radial distribution of tangential arcs
is very broad and extends out to several Einstein radii. Thus, individual arcs
are not well suited for constraining Einstein radii.

previous observations (optical, near-IR, and radio) of this lens show a ""flux
anomaly,"" where the image flux ratios cannot be explained by a simple, central
lens galaxy. We attempt to reproduce the mid-IR flux ratios, which are
insensitive to extinction and microlensing, by modeling the main lens as a
singular isothermal ellipsoid. This model fails to reproduce the flux ratios.
However, we can explain the flux ratios simply by adding to the model a nearby
galaxy detected in the H-band by HST/NICMOS-NIC2. This perturbing galaxy lies
4.0"" from the main lens and it has a critical radius of 0.63"" +/- 0.02"" which
is similar to that of the main lens, as expected from their similar H-band
fluxes. More remarkably, this galaxy is not required to obtain a good fit to
the system astrometry, so this represents the first clear detection of an
object through its effect on the image fluxes of a gravitational lens. This is
a parallel to the detections of visible satellites from astrometric anomalies,
and provides a proof of the concept of searching for substructure in galaxies
using anomalous flux ratios.

adjoint fermions is valid. The Eguchi-Kawai reduction relates gauge theories in
different numbers of dimensions in the large $N$ limit provided that certain
conditions are met. In principle, this relation opens up the possibility of
learning about the dynamics of 4D gauge theories through techniques only
available in lower dimensions. Dimensional reduction can be understood as a
special case of large $N$ equivalence between theories related by an orbifold
projection. In this work, we focus on the simplest case of dimensional
reduction, relating a 4D gauge theory to a 3D gauge theory via an orbifold
projection. A necessary condition for the large N equivalence between the 4D
and 3D theories to hold is that certain discrete symmetries in the two theories
must not be broken spontaneously. In pure 4D Yang-Mills theory, these
symmetries break spontaneously as the size of one of the spacetime dimensions
shrinks. An analysis of the effect of adjoint fermions on the relevant
symmetries of the 4D theory shows that the fermions help stabilize the
symmetries. We consider the same problem from the point of view of the lower
dimensional 3D theory and find that, surprisingly, adjoint fermions are not
generally enough to stabilize the necessary symmetries of the 3D theory. In
fact, a rich phase diagram arises, with a complicated pattern of symmetry
breaking. We discuss the possible causes and consequences of this finding.

YSOs. The distribution of IRAC spectral slopes for our YSOs indicates that most
of these objects are Class II, with a peak towards steeper spectral slopes but
a substantial contribution from a tail of flat spectrum and Class I type
objects. By studying the small fraction of the sample that is optically

young stars are clustered, with about a third of them located in eight clusters

The interaction with the chemical potential is introduced via the coupling to
constituent quark fields as nucleons are not considered as point-like degrees
of freedom in our approach. This mechanism of parity violation is based on
interplay between lightest and heavier degrees of freedom and it cannot be
understood in simple models retaining the pion and nucleon sectors solely. We
argue that, in the appropriate environment (dense and hot nuclear matter of a
few normal densities and moderate temperatures), parity violation may be the

existence of stable bound state of normal nuclear matter. We prove that the so
called 'chiral collapse' never takes place for the parameter region supporting

consider each diatomic unit to be a ""spin"", so that a granular chain can be

possible ways. Experiments and numerical simulations both reveal the existence
of two different mechanisms of wave propagation: In low-disorder chains, we
observe the propagation of a solitary pulse with exponentially decaying

decays as a power law, and the wave transmission becomes insensitive to the
level of disorder. We characterize the spatio-temporal structure of the wave in
both propagation regimes and propose a simple theoretical interpretation for

functionals on $M(G)$, the measure algebra of $G$, denoted by $\wap(M(G))$.
This is a C$^*$-subalgebra of the commutative C$^*$-algebra $M(G)^*$, and so
has character space, say $K_\wap$. In this paper, we investigate properties of
$K_\wap$. We present a short proof that $K_\wap$ can naturally be turned into a
semigroup whose product is separately continuous: at the Banach algebra level,
this product is simply the natural one induced by the Arens products. This is
in complete agreement with the classical situation when $G$ is discrete. A
study of how $K_\wap$ is related to $G$ is made, and it is shown that $K_\wap$
is related to the weakly-almost periodic compactification of the discretisation
of $G$. Similar results are shown for the space of almost periodic functionals
on $M(G)$.

and fears of family caregivers (FCs) regarding 14 innovative technologies (IT)
for care aiding and burden alleviation, given the severe physical and
psychological stress induced by dementia care, and the very slow uptake of
these technologies in our society. Methods - A cluster sample survey based on a
self-administered questionnaire was carried out on data collected from 270
families of patients with Alzheimer's disease or related disorders, located in
the greater Paris area. Multiple Correspondence Analysis was used in addition
to usual statistical tests to identify homogenous FCs clusters concerning the
appreciation or rejection of the considered technologies. Results - Two
opposite clusters were clearly defined: FCs in favor of a substantial use of
technology, and those rather or totally hostile. Furthermore the distributions
of almost all the answers of appreciations were U shaped. Significant relations
were demonstrated between IT appreciation and FC's family or gender statuses
(e.g., female FCs appreciated more than male FCs a tracking device for quick
recovering of wandering patients: p=0.0025, N=195). Conclusions - The study
provides further evidence of the contrasted perception of technology in
dementia care at home, and suggests the development of public debates based on
rigorous assessment of practices and a strict ethical aim to protect against
misuse.

  To this purpose, 91 candidate X-ray groups/poor clusters at redshift 0.1 < z
< 1 are selected from the COSMOS 2 deg^2 survey, based only on their X-ray
luminosity and extent. This sample is complemented by 27 nearby clusters with a
robust, analogous determination of the total and stellar mass inside R_500. The
total sample of 118 groups and clusters with z < 1 spans a range in M_500 of
~10^13--10^15 M_sun. We find that the stellar mass fraction associated with
galaxies at R_500 decreases with increasing total mass as (M_500)^-0.37 \pm
0.04, independent of redshift. Estimating the total gas mass fraction from a
recently derived, high quality scaling relation, the total baryon mass fraction
(f_500^stars+gas=f_500^stars+f_500^gas) is found to increase by ~ 25% when
M_500 increases from <M>=5 X 10^13 M_sun to <M> = 7 X 10^14 M_sun. After
consideration of a plausible contribution due to intra--cluster light (11--22%
of the total stellar mass), and gas depletion through the hierarchical assembly
process (10% of the gas mass), the estimated values of the total baryon mass
fraction are still lower than the latest CMB measure of the same quantity
(WMAP5), at a significance level of 3.3\sigma for groups of <M>=5 X
10^13~M_sun. The discrepancy decreases towards higher total masses, such that
it is 1\sigma at <M>= 7 X 10^14~M_sun. We discuss this result in terms of
non--gravitational processes such as feedback and filamentary heating.

widely, without any significant central concentration. Oh et al. pointed out
that such a distribution is paradoxical: dynamical friction effects estimated

spiral down to the center of the galaxy well within a Hubble time. This paper
is devoted to a discussion of this paradox. We describe a model in which the
stars of the dwarf spheroidal galaxy are embedded in a cloud of dark matter,
and each of these components is specified by its own phase space distribution
function. This model allows us to fit self-consistently the observed luminosity
profile and the spatial variation of the velocity dispersion of the stars. This
fitting yields two basic parameters, related to the central density and
velocity dispersion, that characterize the phase space distribution of dark
matter. The dynamical friction effects calculated on the basis of this
self-consistent model are small enough that the observed spatial distribution
of the globular clusters poses no difficulty, and the apparent paradox is
resolved. Thus we have at hand a model for Fornax that reproduces the main
observed features of this dwarf spheroidal galaxy.

emitting nebulae (Ly-alpha Blobs, LABs) in the z=3.09 proto-cluster in the

large fraction of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in LABs, f_AGN = 17% down to
L_2-32keV ~ 10^44 erg/s. All of the AGN appear to be heavily obscured, with
spectral indices implying obscuring column densities of N_H > 10^23 cm^-2. The
AGN fraction should be considered a lower limit, since several more LABs not
detected with Chandra show AGN signatures in their mid-infrared emission. We
show that the UV luminosities of the AGN are easily capable of powering the
extended Ly-alpha emission via photo-ionization alone. When combined with the
UV flux from a starburst component, and energy deposited by mechanical
feedback, we demonstrate that 'heating' by a central source, rather than
gravitational cooling is the most likely power source of LABs. We argue that
all LABs could be powered in this manner, but that the luminous host galaxies
are often just below the sensitivity limits of current instrumentation, or are
heavily obscured. No individual LABs show evidence for extended X-ray emission,
and a stack equivalent to a >9Ms exposure of an average LAB also yields no
statistical detection of a diffuse X-ray component. The resulting diffuse
X-ray/Ly-alpha luminosity limit implies there is no hot (T>10^7 K) gas
component in these halos, and also rules out inverse Compton scattering of
cosmic microwave background photons, or local far-infrared photons, as a viable
power source for LABs.

type A_n. The cohomologies of these groups are related, by standard results, in
a precise way. By using techniques developed in previous papers, we give
precise formulas (sketching the proofs) for the cohomology of G_{B_n} with
coefficients over the module Q[q^{+-1},t^{+-1}], where the action is
(-q)-multiplication for the standard generators associated to the first n-1

associated to the last node.
  As a corollary we obtain the rational cohomology for G_{tilde{A}_n} as well
as the cohomology of Br_{n+1} with coefficients in the (n+1)-dimensional

corrections due to quantum mechanical deviations in the shape of the emission

inter-nucleon interactions that generate strong short-range correlations, we
derive effective interactions by unitary transformations that are tailored to

either case, the ab initio NCSM preserves translational invariance of the
nuclear many-body problem. In this review, we, in particular, highlight results
obtained with the chiral two- plus three-nucleon interactions. We discuss
efforts to extend the applicability of the NCSM to heavier nuclei and larger

interactions with a core. We outline an extension of the ab initio NCSM to the

coupled conformal field theory that is forced out of its vacuum by a source
that couples to a marginal operator. The source is taken to be of small
amplitude and finite duration, but is otherwise an arbitrary function of time.
When the field theory lives on $R^{d-1,1}$, the source sets up a
translationally invariant wave in the dual gravitational description. This wave
propagates radially inwards in $AdS_{d+1}$ space and collapses to form a black
brane. Outside its horizon the bulk spacetime for this collapse process may
systematically be constructed in an expansion in the amplitude of the source
function, and takes the Vaidya form at leading order in the source amplitude.
This solution is dual to a remarkably rapid and intriguingly scale dependent
thermalization process in the field theory. When the field theory lives on a
sphere the resultant wave either slowly scatters into a thermal gas (dual to a
glueball type phase in the boundary theory) or rapidly collapses into a black
hole (dual to a plasma type phase in the field theory) depending on the time
scale and amplitude of the source function. The transition between these two
behaviors is sharp and can be tuned to the Choptuik scaling solution in
$R^{d,1}$.

energy experiment to study baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and the growth of
structure with an all-sky galaxy redshift survey. The project is designed to
unlock the mystery of dark energy using existing ground-based facilities
operated by NOAO. A new 4000-fiber R=5000 spectrograph covering a 3-degree
diameter field will measure BAO and redshift space distortions in the
distribution of galaxies and hydrogen gas spanning redshifts from 0.2<z<3.5.
The Dark Energy Task Force figure of merit (DETF FoM) for this experiment is
expected to be equal to that of a JDEM mission for BAO with the lower risk and
cost typical of a ground-based experiment.
  This project will enable an unprecedented multi-object spectroscopic
capability for the U.S. community through an existing NOAO facility. The U.S.
community would have access directly to this instrument/telescope combination,
as well as access to the legacy archives that will be created by the BAO key

the matter-localized Ricci integral for energy-momentum in support of the
energy localization hypothesis. The role of the observer is addressed and as an
extension of the special relativistic case, the field of observers comoving
with the matter is seen to compute the intrinsic global energy of a system. The
new localized energy supports the Bonnor claim that the Szekeres collapsing

for certain combinatorial counting problems, yields insight into the hierarchy

problem to be in the class P. In this article we streamline the implementation
of holographic algorithms by eliminating one of the steps in the construction
procedure, and generalize their applicability to new signatures. Instead of
matchgates, which are weighted graph fragments that replace vertices of a
natural bipartite graph G associated to a problem P, our approach uses only
only a natural number-of-edges by number-of-edges matrix associated to G. An
easy-to-compute multiple of its Pfaffian is the number of solutions to the
counting problem. This simplification improves our understanding of the
applicability of holographic algorithms, indicates a more geometric approach to
complexity classes, and facilitates practical implementations. The generalized
applicability arises because our approach allows for new algebraic tests that
are different from the ""Grassmann-Plucker identities"" used up until now.
Natural problems treatable by these new methods have been previously considered
in a different context, and we present one such example.

is not overloaded if the sum of the loads of consumers connected to a generator
does not exceed its maximum production. In the standard grid each consumer is
connected only to its designated generator, while we consider a more general
organization of the grid allowing each consumer to select one generator
depending on the load from a pre-defined consumer-dependent and sufficiently
small set of generators which can all serve the load. The model grid is
interconnected in a graph with loops, drawn from an ensemble of random
bipartite graphs, while each allowed configuration of loaded links represent a
set of graph covering trees. Losses, the reactive character of the grid and the
transmission-level connections between generators (and many other details
relevant to realistic power grid) are ignored in this proof-of-principles
study. We focus on the asymptotic limit and we show that the interconnects
allow significant expansion of the parameter domains for which the probability
of a generator overload is asymptotically zero. Our construction explores the
formal relation between the problem of grid optimization and the modern theory
of sparse graphical models. We also design heuristic algorithms that achieve
the asymptotically optimal selection of loaded links. We conclude discussing
the ability of this approach to include other effects, such as a more realistic
modeling of the power grid and related optimization and control algorithms.

first establish necessary conditions on $S$ at both complex and CR points,
needed for the existence of $M$. All CR points have to be nonminimal and all
complex points have to be ""flat"". Then, adding a positivity condition at
complex points, which is similar to the ellipticity for $n=2$ and excluding the
possibility of $S$ to contain complex $(n-2)$-dimensional submanifolds, we
obtain a solution $M$ to the above problem as a projection of a possibly
singular Levi-flat hypersurface in $R\times C^n$. It turns out that $S$ has to
be a topological sphere with two complex points and with compact CR orbits,
also topological spheres, serving as boundaries of the (possibly singular)
complex leaves of $M$. There are no more global assumptions on $S$ like being
contained in the boundary of a strongly pseudoconvex domain, as it was in case

from incomplete measurements. Several approaches have been developed to recover
the unknown sparse vectors from the given observations, including thresholding,
simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (SOMP), and convex relaxation based on
a mixed matrix norm. Typically, worst-case analysis is carried out in order to
analyze conditions under which the algorithms are able to recover any jointly
sparse set of vectors. However, such an approach is not able to provide
insights into why joint sparse recovery is superior to applying standard sparse
reconstruction methods to each channel individually. Previous work considered
an average case analysis of thresholding and SOMP by imposing a probability
model on the measured signals. In this paper, our main focus is on analysis of
convex relaxation techniques. In particular, we focus on the mixed l_2,1
approach to multichannel recovery. We show that under a very mild condition on
the sparsity and on the dictionary characteristics, measured for example by the
coherence, the probability of recovery failure decays exponentially in the
number of channels. This demonstrates that most of the time, multichannel
sparse recovery is indeed superior to single channel methods. Our probability
bounds are valid and meaningful even for a small number of signals. Using the
tools we develop to analyze the convex relaxation method, we also tighten the
previous bounds for thresholding and SOMP.

three-point function of density peaks (e.g., galaxies), using two different
methods: the Matarrese-Lucchin-Bonometto formula and the locality of galaxy
bias. The bispectrum of peaks is not only sensitive to that of the underlying
matter density fluctuations, but also to the four-point function. For a
physically-motivated, local form of primordial non-Gaussianity in the curvature
perturbation, we show that the galaxy bispectrum contains five physically
distinct pieces: (i) non-linear gravitational evolution, (ii) non-linear galaxy
bias, (iii) f_nl, (iv) f_nl^2, and (v) \gnl. While (i), (ii), and a part of
(iii) have been derived in the literature, (iv) and (v) are derived in this
paper for the first time. Our finding suggests that the galaxy bispectrum is
more sensitive to f_nl than previously recognized, and is also sensitive to a
new term, g_nl. For a more general form of local-type non-Gaussianity, the
coefficient \fnl^2 can be interpreted as \tau_nl, which allows us to test
multi-field inflation models. The usual terms from Gaussian initial conditions,
have the smallest signals in the squeezed configurations, while the others have
the largest signals; thus, we can distinguish them easily. We cannot interpret
the effects of f_nl on B_g(k_1,k_2,k_3) as a scale-dependent bias, and thus
replacing the linear bias in the galaxy bispectrum with the scale-dependent
bias known for the power spectrum results in an incorrect prediction. As the
importance of primordial non-Gaussianity relative to the non-linear gravity
evolution and galaxy bias increases toward higher redshifts, galaxy surveys
probing a high-redshift universe are particularly useful for probing the
primordial non-Gaussianity.

ratio of the transferred luminosity to the surface luminosity of the primary
and U2, the ratio of the transferred luminosity to the nuclear luminosity of
the secondary. The theoretical curves(U1 vs q and U2 vs q) are derived.
Although these curves can reflect the distribution of U1 vs q and U2 vs q, some
observational systems are significantly deviated from these curves. It is
mainly resulted from the difference in the effective temperatures of the
components in W UMa systems.The radius and the density of the secondary are
related to the relative energy tran-sfer rate U2: the higher is U2, the greater
is the expansion and the lower is the density of the secondaries in W UMa
systems. The temperature difference of W UMa binary components is correlated
with the relative energy transfer rate U1 and decreases with increasing U1.
This might suggest that there is a thermal coupling between two components in W
UMa contact binaries, and that the classif-ication of W UMa contact binaries
into A- or W-types depends on the energy tran-sfer from the primary to the
secondary. The temperature difference of W UMa bin-ary components is poorly
correlated with the mass of the primary. This suggests that the properties of

effect on the energy transfer between two components.

or young stars. Shedding light on the nature of these BSS candidates is
crucial, in order to understand the star formation history of dSphs. In this
paper, we consider BSS candidates in Sculptor and Fornax. In Fornax there are
strong hints that the BSS population is contaminated by young stars, whereas in
Sculptor there is no clear evidence of recent star formation. We derive the
radial and luminosity distribution of BSS candidates from wide field imaging
data extending beyond the nominal tidal radius of these galaxies. The
observations are compared with the radial distribution of BSSs expected from
dynamical simulations. In Sculptor the radial distribution of BSS candidates is
consistent with that of red horizontal branch (RHB) stars and is in agreement
with theoretical expectations for BSSs generated via mass transfer in binaries.
On the contrary, in Fornax the radial distribution of BSS candidates is more
concentrated than that of all the considered stellar populations. This result
supports the hypothesis that most of BSS candidates in Fornax are young stars
and is consistent with previous studies.

and conductance of graphene. It is demonstrated that for a cosine potential
$V(x)=V_0\cos(G_0x)$, new zero energy states emerge whenever $J_0(\frac
{2V_0}{\hbar v_F G_0})=0$. The phase of the wavefunctions of these states is
shown to be related to periodic solutions of the equation of motion of an
overdamped particle in a periodic potential, subject to a periodic force.
Numerical solutions of the Dirac equation confirm the existence of these
states, and demonstrate the chirality of states in their vicinity. Conductance
resonances are shown to accompany the emergence of these induced Dirac points.

monoid under the assumption that the monoid satisfies weak divisibility; and if

understand how the nearby quasars are embedded in the local and global density
field of galaxies and how the environment affects quasar activity. We analyse
the environments of nearby quasars using number counts of galaxies. We also
study the dependence of group properties to their distance to the nearest
quasar. The large scale environments are studied by analysing the locations of
quasars in the luminosity density field. Our study of the number counts of
galaxies in quasar environments shows an underdensity of bright galaxies at a
few Mpc from quasars. Also, the groups of galaxies that have a quasar closer
than 2Mpc are poorer and less luminous than in average. Our analysis on the
luminosity density field shows that quasars clearly avoid rich superclusters.
Nearby quasars seem to be located in outskirts of superclusters or in filaments
connecting them. Our results suggest that quasar evolution may be affected by
density variations both on supercluster scales and in the local environment.

difficulty is that, near a corner formed by smooth parts of the piece-wise
smooth boundary, in addition to the solution of the inhomogeneous problem,
there is also an eigensolution. For obtuse corner angles this eigensolution (a)
becomes dominant and (b) has a singular radial derivative of velocity at the
corner. A method is developed that uses the knowledge about the eigensolution
to remove multivaluedness and nonintegrability of the pressure. The method is
first explained in the simple case of a Stokes flow in a corner region and then
generalised for the full-scale unsteady Navier-Stokes flow in a domain with a
free surface.

sample of 946 cluster members that allowed us to trace the velocity dispersion
profile from the center out to r~32 arcmin. The velocity dispersion appears to
decrease monotonically over this range, from a central value of sigma_{v}~17.2
Km/s down to a minimum value of sigma_{v}~5.2 Km/s. The observed surface
brightness profile, rotation curve, velocity dispersion profile and ellipticity
profile are simultaneously well reproduced by a simple dynamical model in which
mass follows light, within the classical Newtonian theory of gravitation. The
comparison with an N-body model of the evolution of a system mimicking omega
Cen during the last 10 orbits into the Galactic potential suggests that (a) the
rotation of stars lying in the inner ~20 arcmin of the clusters is not due to
the effects of the tidal field of the Milky Way, as hypothized by other

aging (ageing) is a complex interplay of genetic regulation and
damage-accumulation. ""Aging as a result of accumulation of 'faults' on cellular
and molecular levels"", has been proposed in the damage (fault)-accumulation
theory. However, this theory fails to explain some aging phenotypes such as
fibrosis and premature aging, since terms such as 'damage' and 'fault' are not
specified. Therefore we introduce some crucial modifications of this theory and
arrive at a novel theory: aging of the body is the result of accumulation of
Misrepair of tissue. It emphasizes: a) it is Misrepair, not the original
damage, that accumulates and leads to aging; and b) aging can occur at
different levels, however aging of the body takes place necessarily on the
tissue level, but not requiring the aging of cells/molecules. The
Misrepair-accumulation theory introduced in the present paper unifies the
understanding of the roles of environmental damage, repair, gene regulation,
and multicellular structure in the aging process. This theory gives
explanations for the aging phenotypes, premature aging, the difference of
longevity in different species, and it is consistent with the physical view on
complex systems.

energy spectrum is infinitely degenerate due to the fact that it is independent
of k. We compare our results with already published work and point out the
relevance of these findings to a systematic formulation of the relativistic

combination of fuzzy logic programming, introduced by P. Vojtas, and hedge
algebras in order to facilitate the representation and reasoning on human
knowledge expressed in natural languages. In fuzzy linguistic logic
programming, truth values are linguistic ones, e.g., VeryTrue,
VeryProbablyTrue, and LittleFalse, taken from a hedge algebra of a linguistic
truth variable, and linguistic hedges (modifiers) can be used as unary
connectives in formulae. This is motivated by the fact that humans reason
mostly in terms of linguistic terms rather than in terms of numbers, and
linguistic hedges are often used in natural languages to express different
levels of emphasis. The paper presents: (i) the language of fuzzy linguistic
logic programming; (ii) a declarative semantics in terms of Herbrand
interpretations and models; (iii) a procedural semantics which directly
manipulates linguistic terms to compute a lower bound to the truth value of a
query, and proves its soundness; (iv) a fixpoint semantics of logic programs,
and based on it, proves the completeness of the procedural semantics; (v)
several applications of fuzzy linguistic logic programming; and (vi) an idea of
implementing a system to execute fuzzy linguistic logic programs.

the predicted spectral shape and the overall normalization between our earlier

squares fits of a modified Haser model with constraints using known rate

Haser model provides a reasonable fit to the observations. Fitting the

initial formation of gas and dust, which is responsible for the prompt emission
that occurs right after impact. A secondary source of gas starts later after
impact when the initial dust has dissipated enough so that solar radiation can
reach the surface of freshly exposed material. The implications of this and

logarithms of least dilatations of pseudo-Anosov maps on a genus-g surface grow
asymptotically with the genus like 1/g, and gave explicit examples of mapping

bound to log 6/g. The braids in this paper give rise to mapping classes with
dilatations bounded above by log(2+sqrt(3))/g. They show that least dilatations

nanoscale samples is that they exhibit the homogeneous properties, which can

vanadium dioxide, which has domain structure associated with its dramatic MIT

new aspects of this famous MIT, including supercooling of the metallic phase by
50 degrees C; an activation energy in the insulating phase consistent with the
optical gap; and a connection between the transition and the equilibrium
carrier density in the insulating phase. Our devices also provide a

V440 Per becomes the longest period Cepheid with the securely established
overtone pulsations. We show, that the convective nonlinear pulsation hydrocode

obtained with the the Infrared Spectrometer on board the Spitzer Space
Telescope. Eight pure H2 rotational lines, from S (0) to S (7), are detected
and mapped. The H2 emission appears to be associated with the warm gas shocked
by the multiple outflows present in the region. A comparison between the
observed intensities and the predictions of detailed shock models indicates
that the emission arises in both slow (12 - 24 km/s) and fast (36 - 53 km/s)
C-type shocks with an initial ortho-to-para ratio of ~ 1. The present H2
ortho-to-para ratio exhibits a large degree of spatial variations. In the
post-shocked gas, it is usually about 2, i.e. close to the equilibrium value (~
3). However, around at least two outflows, we observe a region with a much
lower (~ 0.5) ortho-to-para ratio. This region probably corresponds to gas
which has been heated-up recently by the passage of a shock front, but whose
ortho-to-para has not reached equilibrium yet. This, together with the low
initial ortho-to-para ratio needed to reproduce the observed emission, provide
strong evidence that H2 is mostly in para form in cold molecular clouds. The H2
lines are found to contribute to 25 - 50% of the total outflow luminosity, and
thus can be used to ascertain the importance of star formation feedback on the
natal cloud. From these lines, we determine the outflow mass loss rate and,
indirectly, the stellar infall rate, the outflow momentum and the kinetic
energy injected into the cloud over the embedded phase. The latter is found to
exceed the binding energy of individual cores, suggesting that outflows could
be the main mechanism for core disruption.
