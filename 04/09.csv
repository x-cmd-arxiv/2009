clustering of star-forming galaxies in observations made with the Balloon-borne
Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope, BLAST, at 250, 350, and 500 microns. We
perform jackknife and other tests to confirm the reality of the signal. The
measured correlations are well fit by a power law over scales of 5-25
arcminutes, with Delta I/I = 15.1 +/- 1.7%. We adopt a specific model for
submillimeter sources in which the contribution to clustering comes from
sources in the redshift ranges 1.3 <= z <= 2.2, 1.5 <= z <= 2.7, and 1.7 <= z
<= 3.2, at 250, 350, and 500 microns, respectively. With these distributions,
our measurement of the power spectrum, P(k_theta), corresponds to linear bias
parameters, b = 3.8 +/- 0.6, 3.9 +/- 0.6 and 4.4 +/- 0.7, respectively. We
further interpret the results in terms of the halo model, and find that at the
smaller scales, the simplest halo model fails to fit our results. One way to
improve the fit is to increase the radius at which dark matter halos are
artificially truncated in the model, which is equivalent to having some
star-forming galaxies at z >= 1 located in the outskirts of groups and
clusters. In the context of this model we find a minimum halo mass required to
host a galaxy is log (M_min / M_sun) = 11.5 (+0.4/-0.1), and we derive
effective biases $b_eff = 2.2 +/- 0.2, 2.4 +/- 0.2, and 2.6 +/- 0.2, and
effective masses log (M_eff / M_sun) = 12.9 +/- 0.3, 12.8 +/- 0.2, and 12.7 +/-

luminous, high-redshift, dusty starburst galaxies. In the redshift range 1 <= z
<= 4, these massive submillimetre galaxies go through a phase characterized by
optically obscured star formation at rates several hundred times that in the
local Universe. Half of the starlight from this highly energetic process is
absorbed and thermally re-radiated by clouds of dust at temperatures near 30 K
with spectral energy distributions peaking at 100 microns in the rest frame. At
1 <= z <= 4, the peak is redshifted to wavelengths between 200 and 500 microns.
The cumulative effect of these galaxies is to yield extragalactic optical and
far-infrared backgrounds with approximately equal energy densities. Since the
initial detection of the far-infrared background (FIRB), higher-resolution
experiments have sought to decompose this integrated radiation into the
contributions from individual galaxies. Here we report the results of an
extragalactic survey at 250, 350 and 500 microns. Combining our results at 500
microns with those at 24 microns, we determine that all of the FIRB comes from
individual galaxies, with galaxies at z >= 1.2 accounting for 70 per cent of
it. As expected, at the longest wavelengths the signal is dominated by
ultraluminous galaxies at z > 1.

calculus to the more general setting of Hamiltonian torus actions on compact
symplectic manifolds with isolated fixed points. Given a generic component of
the moment map, we define a canonical class \alpha_p in the equivariant
cohomology of the manifold M for each fixed point p of M. When they exist,
canonical classes form a natural basis of the equivariant cohomology of M; in
particular, when M is a flag variety, these classes are the equivariant
Schubert classes. We show that the restriction of a canonical class \alpha_p to
a fixed point q can be calculated by a rational function which depends only on
the value of the moment map, and the restriction of other canonical classes to
points of index exactly two higher. Therefore, the structure constants can be
calculated by a similar rational function. Our restriction formula is
manifestly positive in many cases, including when M is a flag manifold.
Finally, we prove the existence of integral canonical classes in the case that
M is a GKM manifold the moment map component is index increasing. In this case,
our restriction formula specializes to an easily computable rational sum which
depends only on the GKM graph.

of the chosen graph in the set of surfaces on which the complexifier depends.
In this paper, we examine this question in detail, including a semiclassical
analysis.
  The main result is that we obtain the correct semiclassical properties of the
volume operator for i) artificial rescaling of the coherent state label; and
ii) particular orientations of the 4- and 6-valent graphs that have measure
zero in the group SO(3). Since such requirements are not present when analysing
dual cell complex states, we conclude that coherent states whose complexifiers
are squares of area operators are not an appropriate tool with which to analyse
the semiclassical properties of the volume operator. Moreover, if one intends
to go further and sample over graphs in order to obtain embedding independence,
then the area complexifier coherent states should be ruled out altogether as
semiclassical states.

networks, several cooperative schemes have been earlier proposed using either
distributed space-time coding or distributed beamforming for the transmitter

schemes typically have rather high implementation and/or decoding complexities,
especially when the number of relays is high. In this paper, we propose a
simple low-rate feedback-based approach to achieve maximum diversity with a low

the proposed scheme, the knowledge of the second-order channel statistics is
exploited to design long-term power loading through maximizing the receiver
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with appropriate constraints. This maximization
problem is approximated by a convex feasibility problem whose solution is shown
to be close to the optimal one in terms of the error probability. Subsequently,
to provide robustness against feedback errors and further decrease the feedback
rate, an extended version of the distributed Alamouti code is proposed. It is
also shown that our scheme can be generalized to the differential transmission
case, where it can be applied to wireless relay networks with no CSI available
at the receiver.

tangle of quantized vortex lines--in the limit of very low temperatures when
the motion of vortices is conservative. While certain important aspects of the
decay depend on whether the tangle is non-structured, like the one in the
Kibble-Zurek picture, or essentially polarized, like the one that emulates the
Richardson-Kolmogorov regime of classical turbulence, there are common
fundamental features. In both cases, there exists an asymptotic range in the
wavenumber space where the energy flux is supported by the cascade of Kelvin
waves (kelvons)--precessing distortions propagating along the vortex filaments.
At large enough wavenumbers, the Kelvin-wave cascade is supported by
three-kelvon elastic scattering. At T=0 the dissipative cutoff of the
Kelvin-wave cascade is due to the emission of phonons, in which an elementary
process converts two kelvons with almost opposite momenta into one bulk phonon.
Along with the standard set of conservation laws, a crucial role in the theory
is played by the fact of integrability of the local induction approximation
(LIA) controlled by the parameter \Lambda = \ln (\lambda/a_0), with \lambda the
characteristic kelvon wavelength and a_0 the vortex core radius. While
excluding a straightforward onset of the pure three-kelvon cascade, the
integrability of LIA does not plug the cascade because of the availability of
the kinetic channels associated with vortex line reconnections. We argue that
the crossover from Richardson-Kolmogorov to the Kelvin-wave cascade is due to
eventual dominance of local induction of a single line over the collective
induction of polarized eddies, which causes the breakdown of classical-fluid
regime and gives rise to a reconnection-driven inertial range.

physically distinct regions of the disk, until gravitational waves (GWs) take
over their evolution. Prior to the GW-driven phase, the viscous decay is in the
stalled ""secondary-dominated"" regime. SMBHBs spend a non-negligible fraction of
10^7 years at orbital periods t_var between a day and a year. A dedicated
optical or X-ray survey could identify coalescing SMBHBs statistically, as a
population of periodically variable quasars, whose abundance N_var is
proportional to t_var^alpha, in a range of periods t_var around tens of weeks.
SMBHBs with M < 10^7 M_sun, with 0.5 < alpha < 1.5, would probe the physics of
viscous orbital decay, whereas the detection of a population of higher-mass
binaries, with alpha=8/3, would confirm that their decay is driven by GWs. The
lowest mass SMBHBs (M < 10^{5-6} M_sun) enter the GW-driven regime at short
orbital periods, in the frequency band of the Laser Interferometric Space
Antenna (LISA). While viscous processes are strongly sub-dominant in the last
few years of coalescence, they could reduce the amplitude of any unresolved
background of near-stationary LISA sources. We discuss constraints on the SMBHB
population available from existing data, and the sensitivity and sky coverage
requirements for a detection in future surveys. SMBHBs may also be identified

with the grain data allow some broad conclusions to be drawn: 1) Presolar
O-rich grains formed in AGB stars of mass ~1.15 - 2.2 MSun. The upper-mass
cutoff reflects dredge-up of C in more massive AGB stars, leading to C-rich
dust rather than O-rich, but the lack of grains from intermediate-mass AGB
stars (>4MSun) is a major puzzle. 2) The grain O-isotopic data are reproduced
well if the Galaxy in presolar times was assumed to have a moderate
age-metallicity relationship, but with significant metallicity scatter for
stars born at the same time. 3) The Sun appears to have a moderately low
metallicity for its age and/or unusual 17O/16O and 18O/16O ratios for its
metallicity. 4) The Solar 17O/18O ratio, while unusual relative to present-day
molecular clouds and protostars, was not atypical for the presolar disk and
does not require self-pollution of the protosolar molecular cloud by supernova
ejecta.

observational and modeling developments over the past decade have shown that

heated impulsively by storms of nanoflares. A raging debate concerning the
multi-thermal versus isothermal nature of the loops can be reconciled in terms
of the duration of the storm. We show that short and long storms produce narrow

that warm loops can be explained with thermal nonequilibrium, a process by
which steady heating produces dynamic behavior whenever the heating is highly
concentrated near the loop footpoints. We conclude that this is not a viable
explanation for monolithic loops under the conditions we have considered, but
that it may have application to multi-stranded loops. Serious questions remain,
however.

theoretically been predicted to have a number of interesting properties. Their
recent experimental realization with lattice constants below 100 nanometers
stresses the urgency of a thorough understanding of their electronic
properties. In this work we perform calculations of the band structure for
various hydrogen-passivated hole geometries using both spin-polarized density
functional theory (DFT) and DFT based tight-binding (DFTB) and address the
importance of relaxation of the structures using either method or a combination

ranging from 0.2 eV to 1.5 eV. Band gap sizes and general trends are well
captured by DFTB with band gaps agreeing within about 0.2 eV even for very
small structures. A combination of the two methods is found to offer a good
trade-off between computational cost and accuracy. Both methods predict
non-degenerate midgap states for certain antidot hole symmetries. The inclusion
of spin results in a spin-splitting of these states as well as magnetic moments
obeying the Lieb theorem. The local spin texture of both magnetic and

pion-nucleon/meson-baryon scattering in the Kadyshevsky formalism. This
formalism is introduced and discussed. Problems may arise when derivative
couplings and/or higher spin fields are used, especially when compared to the
results in the Feynman formalism: unwanted contact terms pop-up. These terms
are cancelled using the Gross and Jackiw or Takahashi and Umezawa method. The
final results in both formalisms are therefore equal, causal and covariant.
Formal incorporation of pair suppression in the baryon exchange sector is
achieved using a method based on the Takahashi and Umezawa method. For the
resulting tree level amplitudes, we have shown, to our knowledge for the first
time, that they are causal, covariant and n-independent. Moreover, the
amplitudes are just a factor 1/2 of the usual Feynman expressions. The
amplitudes contain only posititve energy initial and final states, although it
should be mentioned that negative energy is present inside an amplitude via the
Delta propagator. The second part of this thesis deals with higher spin field
quantization in the framework of Dirac's Constraint analysis. A full constraint
analysis and quantization procedure is presented for the free spin 1,3/2 and 2
case and for the situation where these fields are coupled to auxiliary fields.
The constructed propagators in the former case are shown to be non-covariant,
as is well-known. Therefore, auxiliary fields coupled to gauge conditions of
the free case are introduced in the Lagrangian. Now, the resulting propagators
are covariant.

independent of the dynamics of the non-equilibrium theory. In particular, it is
completely determined in terms of the initial conditions, and it is independent

decay hadronically, producing not only a flux of antiprotons but also a flux of

from spallation of cosmic rays on the interstellar medium, while the total
antiproton flux remains consistent with present observations. We show that if

nuclei display broad-band spectra characterized by a large luminosity ratio of
their high-energy (gamma-ray) and low-energy (synchrotron) spectral components.
This large ratio, reaching values up to 100, challenges the standard
synchrotron self-Compton models by means of substantial departures from the
minimum power condition. Luminous blazars have also typically very hard X-ray
spectra, and those in turn seem to challenge hadronic scenarios for the high
energy blazar emission. As shown in this paper, no such problems are faced by
the models which involve Comptonization of radiation provided by a broad
line-region, or dusty molecular torus. The lack or weakness of bulk Compton and
Klein-Nishina features indicated by the presently available data favors
production of gamma-rays via up-scattering of infrared photons from hot dust.
This implies that the blazar emission zone is located at parsec-scale distances
from the nucleus, and as such is possibly associated with the extended,
quasi-stationary reconfinement shocks formed in relativistic outflows. This
scenario predicts characteristic timescales for flux changes in luminous
blazars to be days/weeks, consistent with the variability patterns observed in
such systems at infrared, optical and gamma-ray frequencies. We also propose
that the parsec-scale blazar activity can be occasionally accompanied by
dissipative events taking place at sub-parsec distances and powered by internal
shocks and/or reconnection of magnetic fields. These could account for the
multiwavelength intra-day flares occasionally observed in powerful blazars
sources.

diverse alkylsilanes, such as methoxy, chloro and fluoro silanes for their
capacity to anchor Pluronic efficiently on a glass surface. Our results
demonstrate that hexylmethyldichlorosilane (HMDCS) was the most appropriate

  Systems, August 2nd 2012",,,,"q-fin.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Analysis of the 2007-8 credit crisis has concentrated on issues of relaxed
lending standards, and the perception of irrational behaviour by speculative
investors in real estate and other assets. Asset backed securities have been
extensively criticised for creating a moral hazard in loan issuance and an
associated increase in default risk, by removing the immediate lender's
incentive to ensure that the underlying loans could be repaid. However
significant monetary issues can accompany any form of increased commercial bank
lending, and these appear to have been overlooked by this analysis. In this
paper we propose a general explanation for credit crises based on an
examination of the mechanics of the banking system, and in particular its
internal controls on the supply of credit. We suggest that the current credit
crisis is the result of multiple failures in the Basel regulatory framework,
including the removal of central bank reserve requirements from some classes of
deposit accounts within the banking system, allowing financial instruments
representing debt to be used as regulatory capital, and in particular the
introduction of securitized lending which effectively removed a previously
implicit control over the total quantity of lending originating from the
banking system. We further argue that the interaction of these problems has led
to a destabilising imbalance between total money and loan supply growth, in
that total lending sourced from the commercial bank sector increased at a
faster rate than accompanying growth in the money supply. This not only created
a multi-decade macro-economic debt spiral, but by increasing the ratio of debt
to money within the monetary system acted to increase the risk of loan
defaults, and consequentially reduce the overall stability of the banking
system.

gravitational lens samples. A significant fraction of the systems are expected
to be time delay lenses. Many of the existing lensing degeneracies become less
of an issue with large samples since the distributions of a number of
parameters are predictable, and can be incorporated into an analysis, thus
helping to lessen the degeneracy. Assuming a mean galaxy density profile that
does not evolve with redshift, a Lambda-CDM cosmology, and Gaussian
distributions for bulk parameters describing the lens and source populations,
we generate synthetic lens catalogues and examine the relationship between
constraints on the Omega_m - Omega_Lambda plane and H_0 with increasing lens
sample size. We find that, with sample sizes of ~400 time delay lenses, useful
constraints can be obtained for Omega_m and Omega_Lambda with approximately
similar levels of precision as from the best of other methods. In addition,
sample sizes of ~100 time delay systems yield estimates of H_0 with errors of
only a couple of percent, exceeding the level of precision from current best
estimates such as the HST Key Project. We note that insufficient prior
knowledge of the lens samples employed in the analysis, via under or
overestimates in the mean values of the sample distributions, results in
broadening of constraints. This highlights the need for sound prior knowledge
of the sample before useful cosmological constraints can be obtained from large

strong gravitational lenses. Some of these will have new and unusual image
configurations, and so will enable new applications: for example, systems with
high image multiplicity will allow more detailed study of galaxy and group mass
distributions, while high magnification is needed to super-resolve the faintest
objects in the high redshift universe. Inspired by a set of six unusual lens
systems [including five selected from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) and Strong
Lensing Legacy (SL2S) surveys, plus the cluster Abell 1703], we consider
several types of multi-component, physically-motivated lens potentials, and use
the ray-tracing code ""glamroc"" to predict exotic image configurations. We also
investigate the effects of galaxy source profile and size, and use realistic
sources to predict observable magnifications and estimate very approximate
relative cross-sections. We find that lens galaxies with misaligned disks and
bulges produce swallowtail and butterfly catastrophes, observable as ""broken""
Einstein rings. Binary or merging galaxies show elliptic umbilic catastrophes,
leading to an unusual Y-shaped configuration of 4 merging images. While not the
maximum magnification configuration possible, it offers the possibility of
mapping the local small-scale mass distribution. We estimate the approximate
abundance of each of these exotic galaxy-scale lenses to be ~1 per all-sky
survey. In higher mass systems, a wide range of caustic structures are
expected, as already seen in many cluster lens systems. We interpret the
central ring and its counter-image in Abell 1703 as a ""hyperbolic umbilic""
configuration, with total magnification ~100 (depending on source size). The
abundance of such configurations is also estimated to be ~1 per all-sky survey.

this assumption we calculate the precession damping rate of small amplitude
non-uniform mode magnons in iron, cobalt, and nickel. At scattering rates
expected near and above room temperature, little change in the damping rate is
found as the magnon wavelength is decreased from infinity to a length shorter
than features probed in recent experiments. This result indicates that
non-local effects due to the presence of weakly non-uniform modes, expected in
real devices, should not appreciably affect the dynamic response of the element
at typical operating temperatures. Conversely, at scattering rates expected in
very pure samples around cryogenic temperatures, non-local effects result in an
order of magnitude decrease in damping rates for magnons with wavelengths
commensurate with domain wall widths. While this low temperature result is
likely of little practical importance, it provides an experimentally testable
prediction of the non-local contribution of the spin-orbit torque-correlation
model of precession damping. None of these results exhibit strong dependence on

because they trigger on photon counts, which are number-biased against hard
photons. Therefore, for example, given two bursts of identical peak luminosity
near the detection threshold, a dim soft burst will be preferentially detected
over a dim hard burst. This detector bias can create or skew an apparent
correlation where increasingly hard GRBs appear increasingly bright. Although
such correlations may be obfuscated by a middle step where GRBs need to be
bright enough to have their actual redshifts determined, it is found that the

convolving a wide variety of possible GRB brightnesses and spectra with the

indicate that the rest-frame $\nu F_{\nu}$ spectrum peak energy of

significant corrections for selection effects. Therefore, the appearance of
$\epi$ in seeming correlations such as the Amati ($E_{iso}-\epi$), Ghirlanda

strongly influenced by so far uncalibrated GRB detector thresholds.

effective viscosity increases very rapidly as the stress is decreased towards
the yield stress. Opponents have shown that this viscosity increase levels off,
and that the material behaves as a Newtonian fluid of very high viscosity below
the yield stress. In this paper, we demonstrate experimentally (on four
different materials, using three different rheometers, five different
geometries, and two different measurement methods) that the low-stress
Newtonian viscosity is an artifact that arises in non steady state experiments.
For measurements as long as 10,000 seconds we find that the value of the
'Newtonian viscosity' increases indefinitely. This proves that the yield stress
exists and marks a sharp transition between flowing states and states where the
steady state viscosity is infinite -a solid!

for $J/\psi$ measured by CDF Collaboration are still challenging our
understanding of the heavy quarkonium production mechanism even with recent
significant theoretical progresses on the next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD
calculation. We suggest a new mechanism for $J/\psi$ production at hadron
collider, $pp(\bar p)\to \gamma^{\ast}(J/\psi)+X$ with $J/\psi$ from a virtual
photon $\gamma^{\ast}$ fragmentation. Our calculations show it's $p_t$
distribution at NLO will be larger than that of the conventional $J/\psi$
production from the color-singlet mechanism at NLO when $p_{t}>26$ (35) GeV at
the Tevatron (LHC) and reach about 6 (10) times of the conventional one when
$p_t=50$ (100) GeV at the Tevatron (LHC), in spite of a suppression factor
$(\alpha/\alpha_s)^2$ that is associated with the QED and QCD coupling
constants. In addition, it also has large impact on the $p_{t}$ distribution of
$J/\psi$ polarization in large $p_{t}$ region. Therefore, it is a important
mechanism for $J/\psi$ production at large $p_t$ region especially for the LHC.

of polystyrene on a polydimethylsiloxane-covered substrate, exhibits
interesting behavior like a fast decay of the dewetting velocity and a maximum
in the width of the built-up rim in the course of time. These features have
been recently ascribed to the relaxation of residual stresses in the film that
stem from the nonequilibrium preparation of the samples. Recent experiments by
Coppee et al. on PS with low molecular weight, where such stresses could not be
evidenced, showed however similar behavior. By scaling arguments and numerical
solution of a thin film viscoelastic model we show that the maximum in the
width of the rim can be caused by a temporal evolution of the friction
coefficient (or equivalently of the slip length), for which we discuss two
possible mechanisms. In addition, the maximum in the width is affected by the
sample age. As a consequence, knowing the temporal behavior of friction (or
slip length) in principle allows to measure the aging dynamics of a
polymer-polymer interface by simple dewetting experiments.

Quantum information allows for protocols in the information theoretic setting

the other hand, Kitaev showed that no quantum protocol can have cheating

cheating probability $1/2+\epsilon$ in order to achieve a strong coin flipping

and the $k$-core structure observed in Yeast. An exceptionally large
dynamically relevant core network found in Yeast in comparison with the second
ensemble points to a strong bias towards a collective organization which is
achieved by subtle modifications in the network's degree distributions. We use
a Boolean model of regulatory dynamics with various classes of update functions
to represent in vivo regulatory interactions. We find that the Yeast's core
network has a qualitatively different behaviour, accommodating on average
multiple attractors unlike typical members of both reference ensembles which
converge to a single dominant attractor. Finally, we investigate the robustness
of the networks and find that the stability depends strongly on the used
function class. The robustness measure is squeezed into a narrower band around
the order-chaos boundary when Boolean inputs are required to be nonredundant on
each node. However, the difference between the reference models and the Yeast's
core is marginal, suggesting that the dynamically stable network elements are
located mostly on the peripherals of the regulatory network. Consistently, the

growth of perfect layers by means of chemical vapor deposition. The layers are
sp2 hybridized honeycomb networks with strong in plane sigma and weaker pi
bonds to the substrate and to the adsorbates. This hierarchy in bond strength
causes anisotropic elastic properties, where the sp2 layers are stiff in plane
and soft out of plane. A corrugation of these layers imposes a third hierarchy
level in bond energies, with lateral bonding to molecular objects with sizes
between 1 and 5 nanometer. This extra bond energies are in the range of thermal
energies kT at room temperature and are particularly interesting for
nanotechnology. The concomitant template function will be discussed. The
peculiar bond hierarchy also imposes intercalation as another property of sp2
layer systems. Last but not least sp2 layer systems are particularly robust,

useful outside ultra high vacuum. The Chapter shortly recalls the synthesis,

tension. This last quantity is expected to vanish when the temperature
surpasses a spinodal point beyond which there are no metastable states. Here we
measure for the first time the surface tension in a model glass-former, and
find that it vanishes at the energy separating minima from saddles,
demonstrating the existence of a spinodal point for amorphous metastable order.
Moreover, the fluctuations of surface tension become smaller for lower
temperatures, in quantitative agreement with recent theoretical speculation
that spatial correlations in glassy systems relax nonexponentially because of
the narrowing of the surface tension distribution.

directly interpreted as processes which communicate by two-way channels. The
maps of an SP-category may also be viewed as a proof theory for a simple logic
with a game theoretic intepretation. The cut-elimination procedure for this
logic determines equality only up to certain permuting conversions. As the
equality classes under these permuting conversions are finite, it is easy to
see that equality between cut-free terms (even in the presence of the additive
units) is decidable. Unfortunately, this does not yield a tractable decision
algorithm as these equivalence classes can contain exponentially many terms.
However, the rather special properties of these free categories -- and, thus,
of two-way communication -- allow one to devise a tractable algorithm for
equality. We show that, restricted to cut-free terms s,t : X --> A, the
decision procedure runs in time polynomial on |X||A|, the product of the sizes

the region in which the Standard Model can be considered as a viable effective
field theory all the way up to the Planck scale. The dependence of the index
n_s of scalar perturbations on the Higgs mass is computed in two different
renormalization procedures, associated with the Einstein (I) and Jordan (II)

fluctuations and of the tensor-to-scalar ratio practically do not depend on the
Higgs mass within the admitted region and are equal to n_s=0.97 and r=0.0034

Shannon-Kotel'nikov mappings (S-K mappings) is presented. S-K mappings are
continuous, or piecewise continuous direct source-to-channel mappings operating
directly on amplitude continuous and discrete time signals. Such mappings
include several existing JSCC schemes as special cases. Many existing
approaches to analog- or hybrid discrete analog JSCC provide both excellent
performance as well as robustness to variations in noise level. This at low
delay and relatively low complexity. However, a theory explaining their
performance and behaviour on a general basis, as well as guidelines on how to
construct close to optimal mappings in general, does not currently exist.
Therefore, such mappings are often found based on educated guesses inspired of
configurations that are known in advance to produce good solutions, combination
of already existing mappings, numerical optimization or machine learning
methods. The objective of this paper is to introduce a theoretical framework
for analysis of analog- or hybrid discrete analog S-K mappings. This framework
will enable calculation of distortion when applying such schemes on
point-to-point links, reveal more about their fundamental nature, and provide
guidelines on how they should be constructed in order to perform well at both
low and arbitrary complexity and delay. Such guidelines will likely help
constrain solutions to numerical approaches and help explain why machine
learning approaches finds the solutions they do. This task is difficult and we
do not provide a complete framework at this stage: We focus on high SNR and
memoryless sources with an arbitrary continuous unimodal density function and
memoryless Gaussian channels. We also provide example of mappings based on
surfaces which are chosen based on the provided theory.

set into multiple overlapping ellipsoids and sampling uniformly from within
them. This set of live points climbs up the likelihood surface through nested

recovered from the point set evolution. The algorithm is model-independent in

by Standard Model dynamics, they could also contain a sizable or even leading
contribution from New Physics. Those oscillations are likely to enhance the
observability of CP violation as clear manifestations of New Physics. We
present general formulae for D0 - anti-D0 oscillations, concentrating on the
case of negligible direct CP violation. In particular we derive a general
formula for the time-dependent mixing-induced CP asymmetry in decays to a CP
eigenstate and its correlation with the semileptonic CP asymmetry a_SL(D0) in
D0(t) -> l nu K. We apply our formalism to the Littlest Higgs model with

We find observable effects at a level well beyond anything possible with CKM
dynamics. Comparisons with CP violation in the K and B systems offer an
excellent test of this scenario and reveal the specific pattern of flavour and
CP violation in the D0 - anti-D0 system predicted by this model. We discuss a

the best model-independent bounds on minicharged particles.

orientation of singly charged excitons X+ and X- in self-assembled InAs/GaAs
quantum dots. All measurements were carried out on individual quantum dots
studied by micro-photoluminescence at low temperature. We show that the
hyperfine interaction leads to an effective partial spin relaxation, under
50kHz modulated excitation polarization, which becomes however strongly
inhibited under steady optical pumping conditions because of dynamical nuclear
polarization. This optically created magnetic-like nuclear field can become
very strong (up to ~4 T) when it is generated in the direction opposite to a
longitudinally applied field, and exhibits then a bistability regime. This
effect is very well described by a theoretical model derived in a perturbative
approach, which reveals the key role played by the energy cost of an electron
spin flip in the total magnetic field. Eventually, we emphasize the
similarities and differences between X+ and X- trions with respect to the
hyperfine interaction, which turn out to be in perfect agreement with the
theoretical description.

amplify the gap between its acceptance probabilities in the `yes' and `no'
cases, with a method that is quadratically faster than the procedure given by
Marriott and Watrous. Our construction is natively quantum, based on the
analogy of a product of two reflections and a quantum walk. Second, in some
special cases we show how to amplify the acceptance probability for good
witnesses to 1, making a step towards the proof that QMA with one-sided error
is equal to QMA. Finally, we simplify the filter-state method to search for QMA
witnesses by Poulin and Wocjan.

statistical dependence among random variables involved. The mechanisms
responsible for this, however, are not well understood. We study the effects of
the dependence structure of a finite state hidden Markov model (HMM) on the
likelihood ratios critical for optimal multiple testing on the hidden states.
Various convergence results are obtained for the likelihood ratios as the
observations of the HMM form an increasing long chain. Analytic expansions of
the first and second order derivatives are obtained for the case of binary
states, explicitly showing the effects of the parameters of the HMM on the
likelihood ratios.

generates a whole variety of different quantum phases. While, in the presence
of a single species interacting via on-site interaction, the phase diagram
presents only superfluid or Mott insulating phases, for long-range interactions
or multiple species, exotic phases such as supersolid (SS) or pair-superfluid
(PSF) appear. In this work, we show for the first time that the co-existence of
effective multiple species and long-range interactions leads to the formation
of a novel pair-supersolid (PSS) phase, namely a supersolid of composites. We
propose a possible implementation with dipolar bosons in a bilayer
two-dimensional optical lattice.

transformation relating the near-horizon metric under the Bondi-like
coordinates and the standard Poincar\'e-type or global near-horizon metric of
the extremal Kerr black hole is found, which shows that the two geometries are
the same. Combined with the known thermodynamics of the (weakly) isolated

the case of a large class of non-stationary extremal black holes.
