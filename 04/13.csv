boson at a range of low energy experiments. It couples to the Standard Model
charged particles with a strength <= 10^-3 to 10^-4 of that of the photon. The
possibility of such a particle mediating dark matter self-interactions has
received much attention recently. We consider searches at low energy high
luminosity colliders, meson decays, and fixed target experiments. Based on
available data, searches both at colliders and in meson decays can discover or
exclude such a scenario if the coupling strength is on the larger side. We
emphasize that a dedicated fixed target experiment has a much better potential
in searching for such a gauge boson, and outline the desired properties of such
an experiment. Two different optimal designs should be implemented to cover the
range of coupling strength 10^-3 to 10^-5, and < 10^-5 of the photon,
respectively. We also briefly comment on other possible ways of searching for
such a gauge boson.

  Mihalis Kolountzakis and the author has shown that structural properties -
like spectrality, tiling or packing with a certain set L - of subsets U in
finite or compact groups and on R^d and in Z^d, yield estimates of T(U).
However, in these estimates some notion of the size, i.e. density of L, played
a natural role, and thus in groups where we had no grasp of the notion, we
could not accomplish such estimates.
  In the present work recent new notions of uniform asymptotic upper density
are invoked, allowing a more general investigation of the Turan constant in

of Arestov and Berdysheva, (also obtained independently and along different

by any LCA group, convexity is dropped, and the condition of tiling is also
relaxed to a certain packing type condition and positive uniform asymptotic

problem, with clear applications for describing the interaction among
individuals. Traditional models either are not suited for the task, as in the
case of discrete models, or, like Bounded Confidence models, are built with
rules that make opinions tend to a common ground between agents or not change
at all. Continuous Opinions and Discrete Actions (CODA) model allowed us to
observe the emergence of extremist agents, even when every agent was initially
a moderate, due to local influence effects. In this paper, the problem of
emergence of extremism will be addressed by introducing a middle discrete
option in the CODA model, making it similar to a Potts model. Different
scenarios for the third option will be discussed: when it is equivalent to
withholding judgment, when it is a real third option and when it is a real,
middle option. The effects on the opinions will be studied and its effects on
extremism discussed. Withholding judgment seems to have an unexpected effect,
causing the diminishing of moderate opinions in the long run. For a central
third opinion, we find that, under specific conditions, this new choice can act
as a buffer between the extreme choices.

asymptotic giant branch stars can be used to probe the presence of unseen
stellar companions. A nearby companion modifies the mass loss by
gravitationally focusing the wind towards the orbital plane, and thereby
determines the shape of the envelope at large distances from the star. Using
available simulations, we develop a prescription for the observed shapes of
envelopes in terms of the binary parameters, envelope orientation, and type of
observation. The prescription provides a tool for the analysis of envelope
images at optical, infrared, and millimetre wavelengths, which can be used to
constrain the presence of companions in well observed cases. We illustrate this
approach by examining the possible role of binary companions in triggering the
onset of axi-symmetry in planetary nebula formation. If interaction with the
primary leads to axi-symmetry, the spherical halos widely seen around newly
formed nebulae set limits on the companion mass. Only low mass objects may
orbit close to the primary without observable shaping effects: they remain
invisible until the interaction causes a sudden change in the mass loss
geometry.

the high-contrast diffusion equation. We aim to construct preconditioners that
are robust with respect to the magnitude of the coefficient contrast and the
mesh size simultaneously. For that, we prove and numerically demonstrate the
robustness of the preconditioner proposed by Aksoylu et al. (2008, Comput. Vis.
Sci. 11, pp. 319--331) by extending the devised singular perturbation analysis
from linear finite element discretization to the above discretization. The
singular perturbation analysis is more involved than that of finite element
because all the subblocks in the discretization matrix depend on the diffusion
coefficient. However, that dependence is eliminated asymptotically. This allows
the same preconditioner to be utilized due to similar limiting behaviours of
the submatrices; leading to a narrowing family of preconditioners that can be
used for different discretizations--a desirable preconditioner design goal. We
compare our numerical results to standard cell-centered multigrid and observe
that performance of our preconditioner is independent of the utilized
prolongation operators and smoothers.
  As a side result, we also prove that the solution over the highly-diffusive
island becomes constant asymptotically. Integration of this qualitative
understanding of the underlying PDE to our preconditioner is the main reason
behind its superior performance. Diagonal scaling is probably the most basic
preconditioner for high-contrast coefficients. Extending the matrix entry based
spectral analysis introduced by Graham and Hagger, we rigorously show that the
number of small eigenvalues of the diagonally scaled matrix depends on the
number of isolated islands comprising the highly-diffusive region.

nanoscopic to mesoscopic scales seem endemic, and are possibly generic, to
colossal magnetoresistance manganites and other transition metal oxides. We
show here that an extension, to include long range Coulomb interactions, of a
quantum two-fluid $\ell-b$ model proposed recently for manganites [Phys. Rev.
Lett., {\bf 92}, 157203 (2004)] leads to an excellent description of such
inhomogeneities. In the $\ell-b$ model two very different kinds of electronic
states, one localized and polaronic ($\ell$), and the other extended or broad
band ($b$) co-exist. For model parameters appropriate to manganites, and even
within a simple dynamical mean-filed theory (DMFT) framework, it describes many
of the unusual phenomena seen in manganites, including colossal
magnetoresistance (CMR), qualitatively and quantitatively. However, in the
absence of long ranged Coulomb interaction, a system described by such a model
would actually phase separate, into macroscopic regions of $l$ and $b$
electrons respectively. As we show in this paper, in the presence of Coulomb
interactions, the {\em macroscopic} phase separation gets suppressed, and
instead nanometer scale regions of polarons interspersed with band electron
puddles appear, constituting a new kind of quantum Coulomb glass. Our work
points to an interplay of strong correlations, long range Coulomb interaction
and dopant ion disorder as the origin of nanoscale inhomogeneities, rather than
disorder frustrated phase competition as is generally believed. Based on this,
we argue that the observed micrometer(meso)-scale inhomogeneities owe their
existence to extrinsic causes, eg. strain due to cracks and defects. We suggest
possible experiments to validate our speculation.

host galaxies comes mainly from accretion of gas, but how to fuel them remains
an outstanding unsolved problem in quasar evolution. This issue can be
elucidated by quantifying the radiative efficiency parameter ($\eta$) as a
function of redshift, which also provides constraints on the average spin of
the BHs and its possible evolution with time. We derive a formalism to link
$\eta$ with the luminosity density, BH mass density, and duty cycle of quasars,
quantities we can estimate from existing quasar and galaxy survey data. We find
that $\eta$ has a strong cosmological evolution: at z~2, $\eta \approx 0.3$,
and by $z\approx 0$ it has decreased by an order of magnitude, to $\eta\approx
0.03$. We interpret this trend as evolution in BH spin, and we appeal to
episodic, random accretion as the mechanism for reducing the spin. The
observation that the fraction of radio-loud quasars decreases with increasing
redshift is inconsistent with the popular notion that BH spin is a critical
factor for generating strong radio jets. In agreement with previous studies, we
show that the derived history of BH accretion closely follows the cosmic
history of star formation, consistent with other evidence that BHs and their
host galaxies coevolve.

the fraction of double-stranded DNA in a circular substrate, or by changing the
overall size of the circle (1). DNA constructs contained a pair of Forster
Resonance Energy Transfer dyes that served as probes for affinity assays, and
read out bending forces measured by optical force sensors (2). Small bending
forces significantly increased binding affinity; this effect saturated beyond
~3 pN. Surprisingly, when DNA sequences that bound IHF only weakly were
mechanically bent by circularization, they bound IHF more tightly than the
linear ""high-affinity"" binding sequence. These findings demonstrate that small
bending forces can greatly augment binding at sites that deviate from a
protein's consensus binding sequence. Since cellular DNA is subject to
mechanical deformation and condensation, affinities of architectural proteins

A-scan SFCW-GPR (Stepped Frequency Continuous Wave-Ground Penetrating Radar)
signals with known spectral energy density is proposed. Instead of random
sampling, the proposed method selects the location of samples to follow the
distribution of the spectral energy. Samples collected from three different
measurement methods; the uniform sampling, random sampling, and energy
equipartition sampling, are used to reconstruct a given monocycle signal whose
spectral energy density is known. Objective performance evaluation in term of
PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio) indicates empirically that the CS
reconstruction of random sampling outperform the uniform sampling, while the
energy equipartition sampling outperforms both of them. These results suggest
that similar performance improvement can be achieved for the compressive SFCW
(Stepped Frequency Continuous Wave) radar, allowing even higher acquisition
speed.

strongly connected directed graphs. We first prove a structural theorem for

time-dependent one-dimensional disc models, based on a local cooling time
calculation of the efficiency of transport, to study the radial structure and
stability (against fragmentation) of protoplanetary discs in which self-gravity
is the sole transport mechanism. We find that self-gravitating discs rapidly
attain a quasi-steady state in which the surface density in the inner disc is
high and the strength of turbulence very low (alpha ~ 10^{-3} or less inside 5
au). Temperatures high enough to form crystalline silicates may extend out to
several au at early times within these discs. None of our discs spontaneously
develop regions that would be unambiguously unstable to fragmentation into
substellar objects, though the outer regions (beyond 20 au) of the most massive
discs are close enough to the threshold that fragmentation cannot be ruled out.
We discuss how the mass accretion rates through such discs may vary with disc
mass and with mass of the central star, and note that a determination of the

essentially a pattern-based subspace cluster, is a subset of rows and columns
in a data matrix for which all the rows induce the same linear ordering of
columns. Existing OPSM discovery methods do not scale well to increasingly
large expression datasets. In particular, twig clusters having few genes and
many experiments incur explosive computational costs and are completely pruned
off by existing methods. However, it is of particular interest to determine
small groups of genes that are tightly coregulated across many conditions. In
this paper, we present KiWi, an OPSM subspace clustering algorithm that is

polyacrylamide films deposited on silicon substrates have been studied using
X-ray reflectivity technique. The spin coated polyacrylamide films of similar
thicknesses were annealed at various temperatures below and above the glass
transition temperature of the polymer. The electron density of the films was
found to increase systematically on annealing. The swelling dynamics of the
annealed films were found to have systematic dependence on the temperature of
annealing. The interaction between the substrate and the polymer molecules was
found to play important role in the swelling dynamics of the annealed films
unlike our earlier observation with as coated films. The chain segments
attached directly to the substrate were believed to have restricted freedom of
movements compared to the ones that are at a distance from the substrate and
relatively free. Accordingly, the dynamical behavior of swelling was modeled in
terms of the combination of a free and a restricted component and was found to
be in excellent agreement with the data. The diffusion coefficients
corresponding to the restricted polymer segments were an order of magnitude
smaller than those of the free segments and the fraction of the same was found
to increase with annealing at higher temperatures. The overall reduction of
swellability of the films was explained in terms of the increase of density of
the films and the segmental attachment to the substrate on annealing.

of polyacrylamide were used to prepare spin coated films on silicon substrate.
Light scattering measurements show that the polymer chains were unentangled in
a concentrated (4 mg/ml) as well as in a dilute (2 mg/ml) solution prepared
from the powder, whereas the solution (4 mg/ml) prepared by diluting the
solution source shows entangled chain morphology. Three sets of films of
different thicknesses were prepared using the three solutions by spin coating
on silicon substrates. Comparison of X-ray reflectivity data for as prepared

thickness. Average electron densities of the films were found to follow a trend
of higher density for thinner films with a maximum increase of about 12%
compared to the bulk. The densities of all the films irrespective of the nature
of entanglement and concentration of their source were found to increase with
spin speed of coating and attain saturation at higher speed. Absence of
correlation between shrinkage and density data and the fact that the densities
of all the films follow a master curve irrespective of their origin suggest
that the higher density of the films result from the higher orientation of
chains as a consequence of an interplay between stretching and stronger
attractive interactions of polar nature.

current matrix element splits into a heavy quark matrix element and an overlap
of the initial and final clouds, related to the IW functions, that contain the
long distance physics. The light cloud belongs to the Hilbert space of a
unitary representation of the Lorentz group. Decomposing into irreducible
representations one obtains the IW function as an integral formula,
superposition of irreducible IW functions with positive measures, providing
positivity bounds on its derivatives. Our method is equivalent to the sum rule
approach, but sheds another light on the physics and summarizes and gives all
its possible constraints. We expose the general formalism, thoroughly applying
it to the case j = 0 for the light cloud, relevant to the semileptonic decay
Lambda_b -> Lambda_c + l + nu. In this case, the principal series of the
representations contribute, and also the supplementary series. We recover the
bound for the curvature of the j = 0 IW function xi_Lambda (w) that we did
obtain from the sum rule method, and we get new bounds for higher derivatives.
We demonstrate also that if the lower bound for the curvature is saturated,
then xi_Lambda (w) is completely determined, given by an explicit elementary
function. We give criteria to decide if any ansatz for the Isgur-Wise function
is compatible or not with the sum rules. We apply the method to some simple
model forms proposed in the literature. Dealing with a Hilbert space, the sum
rules are convergent, but this feature does not survive hard gluon radiative
corrections.

long-range interacting cycles, which are constructed by connecting all the two
nodes of distance m on the cycle graph. In our investigation, each node is
continuously monitored by an individual point contact, which induces the
decoherence process. We obtain the analytical probability distribution and the
mixing time upper bound. Our results show that, for small rates of decoherence,
themixing time upper bound is independent of distance parameter m and is
proportional to inverse of decoherence rate.

quasi-static tides. The formalism is valid for arbitrary orbital eccentricities
and therefore applicable to white dwarf binaries in the Galactic disk as well
as globular clusters. In the quasi-static limit, the total perturbation of the
gravitational potential shows a phase shift with respect to the position of the
companion, the magnitude of which is determined primarily by the efficiency of
energy dissipation through convective damping. We determine rates of secular
evolution of the orbital elements and white dwarf rotational angular velocity
for a 0.3 solar mass helium white dwarf in binaries with orbital frequencies in
the LISA gravitational wave frequency band and companion masses ranging from
0.3 to 10^5 solar masses. The resulting tidal evolution time scales for the
orbital semi-major axis are longer than a Hubble time, so that convective
damping of quasi-static tides need not be considered in the construction of
gravitational wave templates of white dwarf binaries in the LISA band. Spin-up
of the white dwarf, on the other hand, can occur on time scales of less than
10Myr, provided that the white dwarf is initially rotating with a frequency
much smaller than the orbital frequency. For semi-detached white dwarf binaries
spin-up can occur on time scales of less than 1Myr. Nevertheless, the time
scales remain longer than the orbital inspiral time scales due to gravitational
radiation, so that the degree of asynchronism in these binaries increases. As a
consequence, tidal forcing eventually occurs at forcing frequencies beyond the
quasi-static tide approximation. For the shortest period binaries, energy
dissipation is therefore expected to take place through dynamic tides and
resonantly excited g-modes.

expressed as the complete normal form to a given base a, is modified by
increasing the value of the base a by one unit and subtracting one unit from
the resulting expression. As initially defined, the first term of the Goodstein
sequence is the complete normal form of m to base 2. Goodstein's Theorem states
that, for all natural numbers, the Goodstein sequence eventually terminates at
zero. Goodstein's Theorem was originally proved using the well-ordered
properties of transfinite ordinals. The theorem was also shown to be
unprovable-in-PA (Peano Arithmetic) using transfinite induction and Godel's
Second Incompleteness Theorem. This article describes a proof of Goodstein's
Theorem in first-order arithmetic that contradicts the theorem's
unprovability-in-PA. The proof uses mathematical induction and is applied (via
the super-exponential function) to a generalized version of the Goodstein
sequences. Such a proof demonstrates the inconsistency of classical set theory,
more precisely the combination of the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms and the axiom of
choice (ZFC).

have a crucial influence on marine ecosystems. Their dynamics partly control
the foraging behaviour and the displacement of marine top predators (tuna,
birds, turtles, and cetaceans). In this work we focus on the role of
submesoscale structures in the Mozambique Channel on the distribution of a
marine predator, the Great Frigatebird. Using a newly developed dynamical
concept, namely the Finite-Size Lyapunov Exponent (FSLE), we have identified
Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs) present in the surface flow in the
Channel over a 2-month observation period (August and September 2003). By
comparing seabirds' satellite positions with LCSs locations, we demonstrate
that frigatebirds track precisely these structures in the Mozambique Channel,
providing the first evidence that a top predator is able to track these FSLE
ridges to locate food patches. After comparing bird positions during long and
short trips, and different parts of these trips, we propose several hypotheses
to understand how frigatebirds can follow these LCSs. The birds might use
visual and/or olfactory cues and/or atmospheric current changes over the
structures to move along these biological corridors. The birds being often
associated to tuna schools around foraging areas, a thorough comprehension of
their foraging behaviour and movement during the breeding season is crucial not
only to seabirds' ecology but also to an appropriate ecosystemic approach of
fisheries in the Channel.

the physical quantities that the waves carry, combined with the constitutive
laws of the medium, and define Lorentzian structures only in degenerate cases
of the dispersion laws that follow from the field equations. It is suggested
that the transition from wave motion to point motion is best factored into an
intermediate step of extended matter motion, which then makes the
dimension-codimension duality of waves and trajectories a natural consequence
of the bicharacteristic (geodesic) foliation associated with the dispersion
law. This process is illustrated in the conventional case of quadratic
dispersion, as well as quartic ones, which include the Heisenberg-Euler
dispersion law. It is suggested that the contributions to geodesic motion from
the non-quadratic nature of a dispersion law might represent another source of
quantum fluctuations about classical extremals, in addition to the diffraction
effects that are left out by the geometrical optics approximation.
