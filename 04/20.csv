underlying model were determined using a fit to the average multiplicities of
the latest measurements at $\sqrt{s}$=10, 29-35, 91 and 130-200 GeV. The

collisions as well as to the production in a second scenario accounting for

demonstrate that, within the accuracy of the experiments, none of the data sets

produced in hard collisions can be explained by large canonical enhancements of
such particles in heavy jets, almost independent of the model parameters.

collection of quantile regressions in high-dimensional sparse models. In these
models the overall number of regressors $p$ is very large, possibly larger than
the sample size $n$, but only $s$ of these regressors have non-zero impact on
the conditional quantile of the response variable, where $s$ grows slower than
$n$. We consider quantile regression penalized by the $\ell_1$-norm of
coefficients ($\ell_1$-QR). First, we show that $\ell_1$-QR is consistent at
the rate $\sqrt{s/n} \sqrt{\log p}$. The overall number of regressors $p$
affects the rate only through the $\log p$ factor, thus allowing nearly
exponential growth in the number of zero-impact regressors. The rate result
holds under relatively weak conditions, requiring that $s/n$ converges to zero
at a super-logarithmic speed and that regularization parameter satisfies
certain theoretical constraints. Second, we propose a pivotal, data-driven
choice of the regularization parameter and show that it satisfies these
theoretical constraints. Third, we show that $\ell_1$-QR correctly selects the
true minimal model as a valid submodel, when the non-zero coefficients of the
true model are well separated from zero. We also show that the number of
non-zero coefficients in $\ell_1$-QR is of same stochastic order as $s$.
Fourth, we analyze the rate of convergence of a two-step estimator that applies
ordinary quantile regression to the selected model. Fifth, we evaluate the
performance of $\ell_1$-QR in a Monte-Carlo experiment, and illustrate its use

Under an in-plane strain of 10 %, the binding energies of hydrogen on graphene
can be improved by 53.89 % and 23.56 % in the symmetric and anti-symmetric

atoms under compression suggests a reversible storage approach of hydrogen. In
the anti-symmetric phase, the binding of hydrogen breaks the sp2 characteristic

construct the equilibrium structure of the polytrope under rotational and tidal

the equilibrium orbital angular velocity is calculated automatically rather
than being prescribed, which is crucial for obtaining apsidal motion rates
accurately. We find that the centrifugal and tidal forces make perturbed stars
more centrally condensed and larger in size. For n=1.5 polytopes with fixed
entropy, the enhancement factor in stellar radii is about 23% and 4-8% for mu=1
and sim0.1-0.9, respectively, where mu is the fractional mass of the polytrope
relative to the total. The centrifugal force dominates the tidal force in
determining the equilibrium structure provided mu > 0.13-0.14 for n > 1.5. The
shape and size of rotationally- and tidally-perturbed polytropes are well
described by the corresponding Roche models as long as n > 2. The apsidal
motion rates calculated for circular-orbit binaries under the equilibrium tide
condition agree well with the predictions of the classical formula only when
the rotational and tidal perturbations are weak. When the perturbations are
strong as in critical configurations, the classical theory underestimates the
real apsidal motion rates by as much as 50% for n=1.5 polytropes, although the
discrepancy becomes smaller as n increases. For practical uses, we provide
fitting formulae for various quantities including the density concentration,
volume radius, and effective internal structure constant, as functions of mu

which is based on an abstract representation of opinions as $k$--dimensional

below a defined similarity threshold $d_I$. Depending on $d_I$, different
behaviour of the population is observed: low values result in a state of highly
fragmented opinions and higher values yield consensus. The first contribution
of this research is to identify the values of parameters $d_I$ and $k$, such
that the transition between fragmented opinions and homogeneity takes place.
Then, we look at this transition from two perspectives: first by studying the
group size distribution and second by analysing the communication network that
is formed by the interactions that take place during the simulation. The
emerging networks are classified by statistical means and we find that
non--trivial social structures emerge from simple rules for individual
communication. Generating networks allows to compare model outcomes with

information and for a given volume the attainable precision is determined by
the galaxy shot noise sigma_n^2 relative to the power spectrum P. It is
generally assumed that shot noise is white and given by the inverse of the
number density n. In this paper we argue one may be able to considerably
improve upon this: in the halo picture of cosmological structure all of the
dark matter is in halos of varying mass and galaxies are formed inside these
halos, but for the dark matter mass and momentum conservation guarantee that
nonlinear effects cannot develop a white noise in the dark matter power
spectrum on large scales. This suggests that with a suitable weighting a
similar effect may be achieved for galaxies, suppressing their shot noise. We
explore this idea with N-body simulations by weighting central halo galaxies by
halo mass and find that the resulting shot noise can be reduced dramatically
relative to expectations, with a 10-30 suppression at the highest number
density of n=4*10^-3 (Mpc/h)^3 resolved in our simulations. For specific
applications other weighting schemes may achieve even better results and for
n=3*10^-4(Mpc/h)^3 we can reduce sigma_n^2/P by up to a factor of 10 relative
to uniform weighting. These results open up new opportunities to extract
cosmological information in galaxy surveys, such as the recently proposed
multi-tracer approach to cancel sampling variance, and may have important
consequences for the planning of future redshift surveys. Taking full advantage
of these findings may require better understanding of galaxy formation process
to develop accurate tracers of the halo mass.

strongly enhanced electric field at their tips; this field is created by a thin
curved space charge layer. These multiple scales are already challenging when
the electrons are approximated by densities. However, electron density
fluctuations in the leading edge of the front and non-thermal stretched tails
of the electron energy distribution (as a cause of X-ray emissions) require a
particle model to follow the electron motion. As super-particle methods create
wrong statistics and numerical artifacts, modeling the individual electron
dynamics in streamers is limited to early stages where the total electron
number still is limited.
  The method of choice is a hybrid computation in space where individual
electrons are followed in the region of high electric field and low density
while the bulk of the electrons is approximated by densities (or fluids). We
here develop the hybrid coupling for planar fronts. First, to obtain a
consistent flux at the interface between particle and fluid model in the hybrid
computation, the widely used classical fluid model is replaced by an extended
fluid model. Then the coupling algorithm and the numerical implementation of
the spatially hybrid model are presented in detail, in particular, the position
of the model interface and the construction of the buffer region. The method
carries generic features of pulled fronts that can be applied to similar

intrinsic priors, the corresponding Bayesian procedure for variable selection
in normal regression is consistent in the entire class of normal linear models.
We find that the asymptotics of the Bayes factors for intrinsic priors are
equivalent to those of the Schwarz (BIC) criterion. Also, recall that the
Jeffreys--Lindley paradox refers to the well-known fact that a point null
hypothesis on the normal mean parameter is always accepted when the variance of
the conjugate prior goes to infinity. This implies that some limiting forms of
proper prior distributions are not necessarily suitable for testing problems.
Intrinsic priors are limits of proper prior distributions, and for finite

selection in regression; a consequence of our results is that for intrinsic
priors Lindley's paradox does not arise.

extrasolar planet of known mass and radius, being slightly larger and more
massive than Neptune (M=22.6 M_Earth, R=4.19R_Earth). In this regime, several
bulk compositions are possible: from an Earth-like core with a thick hydrogen

Neptune-like structure. We combine planet-structure modeling with an advanced
planet-formation model to assess the likelihood of the different possible bulk
compositions of GJ 436 b. We find that both an envelope-free water planet

unlikely outcome of planet formation around such a low-mass star. We conclude
that GJ 436 b is probably of much higher rock content than Neptune (more than
45% in mass), with a small H-He envelope (10 - 20% in mass). This is the
expected outcome of the gathering of materials during the migration process in

matter in the Universe. The majority of lensing analyses uses the two-point
statistics of the cosmic shear field to constrain the cosmological model
yielding degeneracies, such as that between sigma_8 and Omega_M respectively
the r.m.s. of the mass fluctuations at a scale of 8 Mpc/h and the matter
density parameter both at z = 0. However, the two-point statistics only measure
the Gaussian properties of the field and the weak lensing field is
non-Gaussian. It has been shown that the estimation of non-Gaussian statistics
on weak lensing data can improve the constraints on cosmological parameters. In
this paper, we systematically compare a wide range of non-Gaussian estimators
in order to determine which one provides tighter constraints on the
cosmological parameters. These statistical methods include skewness, kurtosis
and the Higher Criticism test in several sparse representations such as wavelet
and curvelet; as well as the bispectrum, peak counting and a new introduced
statistic called Wavelet Peak Counting (WPC). Comparisons based on sparse
representations show that the wavelet transform is the most sensitive to
non-Gaussian cosmological structures. It appears also that the best statistic
for non-Gaussian characterization in weak lensing mass maps is the WPC.
Finally, we show that the sigma_8 -Omega_m degeneracy could be even better

the ISOPHOT instrument aboard the ISO satellite. The results are used to seek
further confirmation of the CIRB levels that have been derived by various

The surface brightness observed with the ISOPHOT instrument at 90, 150, and 180
um is correlated with hydrogen 21 cm line data from the Effelsberg radio
telescope. Extrapolation to zero hydrogen column density gives an estimate for
the sum of extragalactic signal plus zodiacal light. The zodiacal light is
subtracted using ISOPHOT data at shorter wavelengths. Thus, the resulting
estimate of the far-infrared CIRB is based on ISO measurements alone. In the
range 150 to 180 um, we obtain a CIRB value of 1.08+-0.32+-0.30 MJy/sr quoting
statistical and systematic errors separately. In the 90 um band, we obtain a
2-sigma upper limit of 2.3 MJy/sr. The estimates derived from ISOPHOT

(exponential waiting-time and power-law size distributions) are consistent with
a critical self-organization process, wherein superfluid vortices pin
metastably in macroscopic domains and unpin collectively via nearest-neighbor
avalanches. Macroscopic inhomogeneity emerges naturally if pinning occurs at
crustal faults. If, instead, pinning occurs at lattice sites and defects, which
are macroscopically homogeneous, we show that an alternative, noncritical
self-organization process operates, termed coherent noise, wherein the global
Magnus force acts uniformly on vortices trapped in a range of pinning
potentials and undergoing thermal creep. It is found that vortices again unpin
collectively, but not via nearest-neighbor avalanches, and that,
counterintuitively, the resulting glitch sizes are scale invariant, in accord
with observational data. A mean-field analytic theory of the coherent noise
process, supported by Monte-Carlo simulations, yields a power-law size
distribution, between the smallest and largest glitch, with exponent $a$ in the
range $-2\leq a \leq 0$. When the theory is fitted to data from the nine most
active pulsars, including the two quasiperiodic glitchers PSR J0537$-$6910 and
PSR J0835$-$4510, it directly constrains the distribution of pinning potentials
in the star, leading to two conclusions: (i) the potentials are broadly
distributed, with the mean comparable to the standard deviation; and (ii) the
mean potential decreases with characteristic age. An observational test is
proposed to discriminate between nearest-neighbor avalanches and coherent

phases are distinguished primarily by their volatilities. We find the US
economy, as measured by the DJI, spends most of its time in a low-volatility
phase and a high-volatility phase. The former can be roughly associated with
economic expansion, while the latter contains the economic contraction phase in
the standard economic cycle. Both phases are interrupted by a
moderate-volatility market, but extremely-high-volatility market crashes are
found mostly within the high-volatility phase. From the temporal distribution
of various phases, we see a high-volatility phase from mid-1998 to mid-2003,
and another starting mid-2007 (the current global financial crisis).
Transitions from the low-volatility phase to the high-volatility phase are
preceded by a series of precursor shocks, whereas the transition from the
high-volatility phase to the low-volatility phase is preceded by a series of
inverted shocks. The time scale for both types of transitions is about a year.
We also identify the July 1997 Asian Financial Crisis to be the trigger for the

diffusion parallel and perpendicular to magnetic field lines, respectively. The

magnetic diffusion and is significantly affected by the ionization degree. In
addition, ion-neutral collisions is the most efficient damping mechanism for
short wavelengths while ohmic diffusion dominates in the long-wavelength

10-20 minutes. Their total duration is about 4--6 hours. The MSTWP spatial
structure is characterized by a high degree of anisotropy and coherence at the
distance of more than 10 wavelengths. The MSTWP direction of travelling is
characterized by a high directivity regardless of seasons. Occurrence rate of
daytime MSTWPs is high in winter and during equinoxes. Occurrence rate of
nighttime MSTIDs has its peak in summer. These features are consistent with
previous MS travelling ionosphere disturbance (TID) statistics obtained from

hemisphere are observed 3-4 hours after the morning ST passage. In summer,
MSTWPs are detected 1.5-2 hours before the evening ST occurrence at the point

have measured the angular clustering of our survey and find significant
positive clustering signals in the soft and hard bands, and a marginal
clustering detection in the ultrahard band. We find dependency of the
clustering strength on the flux limit and no significant differences in the
clustering properties between sources with high hardness ratios and those with
low hardness ratios. Our results show that obscured and unobscured objects
share similar clustering properties and therefore they both reside in similar
environments, in agreement with the unified model of AGN. We deprojected the
angular clustering parameters via Limber's equation to compute their typical
spatial lengths. From that we have inferred the typical mass of the dark matter
haloes in which AGN at redshifts of ~1 are embedded. The short AGN lifetimes
derived suggest that AGN activity might be a transient phase that can be

vorticity field $\omega(x,y,0)=\omega_0$. This number, denoted by $N$, is
defined as the minimum dimension such that for $n\ge N$, arbitrary
$n$-dimensional balls in phase space centred on the solution trajectory
$\omega(x,y,t)$, for $t>0$, contract under the dynamics of the system
linearized about $\omega(x,y,t)$. In other words, $N$ is the minimum number of
greatest Lyapunov exponents whose sum becomes negative. It is found that $N\le
C_1R_e$ when the phase space is endowed with the energy norm, and $N\le
C_2R_e(1+\ln R_e)^{1/3}$ when the phase space is endowed with the enstrophy
norm. Here $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constant and $R_e$ is the Reynolds number
defined in terms of $\omega_0$, the system length scale, and the viscosity
$\nu$. The linear (or nearly linear) dependence of $N$ on $R_e$ is consistent
with the estimate for the number of active modes deduced from a recent
mathematical bound for the viscous dissipation wave number. This result is in a
sharp contrast to the forced case, for which well-known estimates for the
Hausdorff dimension $D_H$ of the global attractor scale highly superlinearly
with $\nu^{-1}$. We argue that the ""extra"" dependence of $D_H$ on $\nu^{-1}$ is
not an intrinsic property of the turbulent dynamics. Rather, it is a ""removable

viscosity, the sheet thickness experiences a nonlinear collapse. Viscosity
regularizes solutions at small scales. Transition from resistive to viscous

Inconsistency Robustness is to make contradictions explicit so that arguments
for and against propositions can be formalized. This paper explores the role of
Inconsistency Robustness in the history and theory of Logic Programs.
  Robert Kowalski put forward a bold thesis: ""Looking back on our early
discoveries, I value most the discovery that computation could be subsumed by
deduction."" However, mathematical logic cannot always infer computational steps
because computational systems make use of arbitration for determining which
message is processed next by a recipient that is sent multiple messages
concurrently. Since reception orders are in general indeterminate, they cannot
be inferred from prior information by mathematical logic alone. Therefore
mathematical logic cannot in general implement computation.
  Over the course of history, the term ""Functional Program"" has grown more
precise and technical as the field has matured. ""Logic Program"" should be on a
similar trajectory. Accordingly, ""Logic Program"" should have a general precise
characterization. In the fall of 1972, different characterizations of Logic
Programs that have continued to this day:
  * A Logic Program uses Horn-Clause syntax for forward and backward chaining
  * Each computational step (according to Actor Model) of a Logic Program is
deductively inferred (e.g. in Direct Logic).
  The above examples are illustrative of how issues of inconsistency robustness
have repeatedly arisen in Logic Programs.

modelling the spatial variation of a telescope point spread function (PSF)
across the instrument field of view, a crucial stage in lensing data analysis,
but the technique may be used to rank competing models wherever data are
described empirically. As such it may, with further development, provide useful
extra information when used in combination with existing model selection
techniques such as the Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria, or the
Bayesian evidence. Two independent diagnostic correlation functions are
described and the interpretation of these functions demonstrated using a
simulated PSF anisotropy field. The efficacy of these diagnostic functions as
an aid to the correct choice of empirical model is then demonstrated by
analyzing results for a suite of Monte Carlo simulations of random PSF fields
with varying degrees of spatial structure, and it is shown how the diagnostic
functions can be related to requirements for precision cosmic shear
measurement. The limitations of the technique, and opportunities for
improvements and applications to fields other than weak gravitational lensing,

1978] proposed a probabilistic technique for approximate counting that is
extremely space-efficient. The basic idea is to increment a counter containing
the value $X$ with probability $2^{-X}$. As a result, the counter contains an
approximation of $\lg n$ after $n$ probabilistic updates stored in $\lg\lg n$
bits. Here we revisit the original idea of Morris, and introduce a binary
floating-point counter that uses a $d$-bit significand in conjunction with a
binary exponent. The counter yields a simple formula for an unbiased estimation
of $n$ with a standard deviation of about $0.6\cdot n2^{-d/2}$, and uses
$d+\lg\lg n$ bits.
  We analyze the floating-point counter's performance in a general framework

  Dynamic Deceptive Functions","Technical report complementing Carlos Fernandes' PhD",,,,"cs.NE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  Traditional Genetic Algorithms (GAs) mating schemes select individuals for
crossover independently of their genotypic or phenotypic similarities. In
Nature, this behaviour is known as random mating. However, non-random schemes -
in which individuals mate according to their kinship or likeness - are more
common in natural systems. Previous studies indicate that, when applied to GAs,
negative assortative mating (a specific type of non-random mating, also known
as dissortative mating) may improve their performance (on both speed and
reliability) in a wide range of problems. Dissortative mating maintains the
genetic diversity at a higher level during the run, and that fact is frequently
observed as an explanation for dissortative GAs ability to escape local optima
traps. Dynamic problems, due to their specificities, demand special care when
tuning a GA, because diversity plays an even more crucial role than it does
when tackling static ones. This paper investigates the behaviour of
dissortative mating GAs, namely the recently proposed Adaptive Dissortative
Mating GA (ADMGA), on dynamic trap functions. ADMGA selects parents according
to their Hamming distance, via a self-adjustable threshold value. The method,
by keeping population diversity during the run, provides an effective means to
deal with dynamic problems. Tests conducted with deceptive and nearly deceptive
trap functions indicate that ADMGA is able to outperform other GAs, some
specifically designed for tracking moving extrema, on a wide range of tests,
being particularly effective when speed of change is not very fast. When
comparing the algorithm to a previously proposed dissortative GA, results show
that performance is equivalent on the majority of the experiments, but ADMGA
performs better when solving the hardest instances of the test set.
