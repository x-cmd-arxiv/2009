follows from unitarity and the AdS/CFT correspondence. We consider a ball of
homogeneous, rotating dust in global AdS3 whose backreaction produces a region
of Goedel space inside the ball. We solve the Israel matching conditions to
find the geometry outside of the dust ball and compute its quantum numbers in
the dual CFT. When the radius of the dust ball exceeds a certain critical
value, the spacetime will contain closed timelike curves. Our main observation
is that precisely when this critical radius is exceeded, a unitarity bound in
the dual CFT is violated, leading to a holographic argument for chronology
protection.

intra-cluster gas out to radius r_500 and beyond. The goal is to study the
physical properties of the intra-cluster gas by using a non-parametric
de-projection method that is, aside from the assumption of spherical symmetry,
free from modeling bias. We use publicly available X-ray imaging data from the
XMM-Newton observatory and our Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect (SZE) imaging data
from the APEX-SZ experiment at 150 GHz to de-project the density and
temperature profiles for the relaxed cluster Abell 2204. We derive the gas
density, temperature and entropy profiles assuming spherical symmetry, and
obtain the total mass profile under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium.
For comparison with X-ray spectroscopic temperature models, a re-analysis of
the recent Chandra observation is done with the latest calibration updates.
Using the non-parametric modeling we demonstrate a decrease of gas temperature
in the cluster outskirts, and also measure the gas entropy profile. These
results are obtained for the first time independently of X-ray spectroscopy,
using SZE and X-ray imaging data. The contribution of the SZE systematic
uncertainties in measuring T_e at large radii is shown to be small compared to
the Chandra systematic spectroscopic errors. The upper limit on M_200 derived
from the non-parametric method is consistent with the NFW model prediction from
weak lensing analysis.

from which to tackle with it. As it will be discussed, their approach shares
goals with a current hot research topic (namely, learning to rank for

additionally, it can be used to change the search engine's response in

also an elegant solution to the stated problem; what's more, it achieves
promising results, both increasing the performance of a major search engine for

supernova matter is presented with focus on the liquid-gas phase transition of
nuclear matter. It consists of an ensemble of nuclei and interacting nucleons
in nuclear statistical equilibrium. A relativistic mean field model is applied
for the nucleons. The masses of the nuclei are taken from nuclear structure
calculations which are based on the same nuclear Lagrangian. For known nuclei
experimental data is used directly. Excluded volume effects are implemented in
a thermodynamic consistent way so that the transition to uniform nuclear matter
at large densities can be described. Thus the model can be applied at all
densities relevant for supernova simulations, i.e. rho=10^5 - 10^15 g/cm^3, and
it is possible to calculate a complete supernova EOS table. The model allows to
investigate the role of shell effects, which lead to narrow-peaked
distributions around the neutron magic numbers for low temperatures. At larger
temperatures the distributions become broad. The significance of the
statistical treatment and the nuclear distributions for the composition is
shown. We find that the contribution of light clusters is very important and is
only poorly represented by alpha-particles alone. The results for the EOS are
systematically compared to two commonly used models for supernova matter which
are based on the single nucleus approximation. Apart from the composition, in
general only small differences of the different EOSs are found. The differences
are most pronounced around the (low-density) liquid-gas phase transition line
where the distribution of light and intermediate clusters has an important
effect. Possible extensions and improvements of the model are discussed.

regression as well as the object of intense theoretical investigation. But
despite the availability of efficient algorithms, the lasso remains
computationally demanding in regression problems where the number of variables
vastly exceeds the number of data points. A much older method, marginal
regression, largely displaced by the lasso, offers a promising alternative in
this case. Computation for marginal regression is practical even when the
dimension is very high. In this paper, we study the relative performance of the
lasso and marginal regression for regression problems in three different
regimes: (a) exact reconstruction in the noise-free and noisy cases when design
and coefficients are fixed, (b) exact reconstruction in the noise-free case
when the design is fixed but the coefficients are random, and (c)
reconstruction in the noisy case where performance is measured by the number of
coefficients whose sign is incorrect.

fails, and characterize the advantages and disadvantages of each. In the second

Human Protein Homology Network (H-PHN) exhibits similar features to an
Achlioptas-type process and is markedly different from regular random
percolation. The underlying mechanism of this transition can be described by
slow-growing clusters that remain isolated until the later stages of the
process, when the addition of a small number of links leads to the rapid
interconnection of these modules into a giant cluster. Our results indicate
that the evolutionary-based process that shapes the topology of the H-PHN
through duplication-divergence events may occur in sudden steps, similarly to
what is seen in first-order phase transitions.

place in the Early Universe. We assume that the matter filling the isotropic
and homogeneous background is to be described by a relativistic viscous fluid
characterized by an ultra-relativistic equation of state and finite bulk
viscosity deduced from recent lattice QCD calculations and heavy-ion collisions
experiments. We concentrate our treatment to bulk viscosity as one of the
essential dissipative processes in the rapidly expanding Early Universe and
deduce the dependence of the scale factor and Hubble parameter on the comoving
time $t$. We find that both scale factor and Hubble parameter are finite at
$t=0$, revering to absence of singularity. We also find that their evolution
apparently differs from the one resulting in when assuming that the background
matter is an ideal and non-viscous fluid.

spectroscopy is used to estimate black hole mass (M_BH). We study the cosmic
evolution of the M_BH-spheroid luminosity (L_sph) relation. In combination with
our previous work, totaling 40 Seyfert-1 galaxies, the covered range in BH mass
is substantially increased, allowing us to determine for the first time
intrinsic scatter and correct evolutionary trends for selection effects. We
re-analyze archival HST images of 19 local reverberation-mapped active galaxies
to match the procedure adopted at intermediate redshift. Correcting spheroid
luminosity for passive luminosity evolution and taking into account selection
effects, we determine that at fixed present-day V-band spheroid luminosity,
M_BH/L_sph \propto (1+z)^(2.8+/-1.2). When including a sample of 44 quasars out
to z=4.5 taken from the literature, with luminosity and BH mass corrected to a
self-consistent calibration, we extend the BH mass range to over two orders of
magnitude, resulting in M_BH/L_sph \propto (1+z)^(1.4+/-0.2). The intrinsic
scatter of the relation, assumed constant with redshift, is 0.3+/-0.1 dex (<0.6
dex at 95% CL). The evolutionary trend suggests that BH growth precedes
spheroid assembly. Interestingly, the M_BH-total host-galaxy luminosity
relation is apparently non-evolving. It hints at either a more fundamental
relation or that the spheroid grows by a redistribution of stars. However, the
high-z sample does not follow this relation, indicating that major mergers may
play the dominant role in growing spheroids above z~1.

producing faster algorithms in applications ranging from graph partitioning to
semidefinite programming. In the decade or so of research into this technique,
the focus has been--with few exceptions--on ensuring the quality of
approximation in the spectral and Frobenius norms. For certain graph
algorithms, however, the $(\infty,1)$ norm may be a more natural measure of
performance.
  This paper addresses the problem of approximating a real matrix A by a sparse
random matrix X with respect to several norms. It provides the first results on
approximation error in the $(\infty, 1)$ and $(\infty, 2)$ norms, and it uses a
result of Latala to study approximation error in the spectral norm. These
bounds hold for random sparsification schemes which ensure that the entries of
X are independent and average to the corresponding entries of A. Optimality of
the $(\infty, 1)$ and $(\infty,2)$ error estimates is established.
Concentration results for the three norms hold when the entries of X are
uniformly bounded. The spectral error bound is used to predict the performance
of several sparsification and quantization schemes that have appeared in the
literature; the results are competitive with the performance guarantees given
by earlier scheme-specific analyses.

out to 6 kpc, or ~6 scale lengths. The outer disk was imaged to a depth of
M_F606W ~ 1, and an inner field was imaged to the crowding limit at a depth of
M_F606W ~ -1. Through detailed analysis and modeling of these CMDs we have
reconstructed the star formation history of the stellar populations currently
residing in these portions of the galaxy, finding similar ancient populations
at all radii but significantly different young populations at increasing radii.
In particular, outside of the well-measured break in the disk surface
brightness profile, the age of the youngest population increases with distance
from the galaxy center, suggesting that star formation is shutting down from
the outside-in. We use our measured star formation history, along with H I
surface density measurements, to reconstruct the surface density profile of the
disk during previous epochs. Comparisons between the recovered star formation
rates and reconstructed gas densities at previous epochs are consistent with
star formation following the Schmidt law during the past 0.5 Gyrs, but with a
drop in star formation efficiency at low gas densities, as seen in local
galaxies at the present day. The current rate and gas density suggest that
rapid star formation in NGC 2976 is currently in the process of ceasing from
the outside-in due to gas depletion. This process of outer disk gas depletion
and inner disk star formation was likely triggered by an interaction with the
core of the M81 group >~1 Gyr ago that stripped the gas from the galaxy halo
and/or triggered gas inflow from the outer disk toward the galaxy center.

function of two input children masses Mc(a) and Mc(b). We propose two methods
for an independent determination of the individual children masses Mc(a) and
Mc(b). First, in the presence of upstream transverse momentum P(UTM) the
corresponding function Mp(Mc(a),Mc(b),P(UTM)) is independent of P(UTM) at
precisely the right values of the children masses. Second, the previously
discussed MT2 ""kink"" is now generalized to a ""ridge"" on the 2-dimensional
surface Mp(Mc(a),Mc(b)). As we show in several examples, quite often there is a
special point along that ridge which marks the true values of the children

debris disks at 30-150 AU around 1-3 solar mass stars. Disks composed of large,
strong planetesimals produce more massive planets than disks composed of small,
weak planetesimals. The maximum radius of icy planets ranges from roughly 1500
km to 11,500 km. The formation rate of 1000 km objects - `Plutos' - is a useful
proxy for the efficiency of icy planet formation. Plutos form more efficiently
in massive disks, in disks with small planetesimals, and in disks with a range
of planetesimal sizes. Although Plutos form throughout massive disks, Pluto
production is usually concentrated in the inner disk. Despite the large number
of Plutos produced in many calculations, icy planet formation is inefficient.
At the end of the main sequence lifetime of the central star, Plutos contain
less than 10% of the initial mass in solid material. This conclusion is
independent of the initial mass in the disk or the properties of planetesimals.
Debris disk formation coincides with the formation of planetary systems
containing Plutos. As Plutos form, they stir leftover planetesimals to large
velocities. A cascade of collisions then grinds the leftovers to dust, forming
an observable debris disk. In disks with small (< 1-10 km) planetesimals,
collisional cascades produce luminous debris disks with maximum luminosity
roughly 0.01 times the stellar luminosity. Disks with larger planetesimals
produce much less luminous debris disks. Observations of debris disks around
A-type and G-type stars strongly favor models with small planetesimals. In
these models, our predictions for the time evolution and detection frequency of
debris disks agree with published observations. We suggest several critical
observations that can test key features of our calculations.

density, a proxy for the comoving star formation rate (SFR) density. We
characterise galaxies as having either a cold or hot IR SED depending upon
whether the rest-frame wavelength of their peak IR energy output is above or
below 90um. Our work is based on a far-IR selected sample both in the local
Universe and at high redshift, the former consisting of IRAS 60um-selected
galaxies at z<0.07 and the latter of Spitzer 70um selected galaxies across
0.1<z<1. We find that the total IR luminosity densities for each
redshift/luminosity bin agree well with results derived from other deep
mid/far-IR surveys. At z<0.07 we observe the previously known results: that
moderate luminosity galaxies (L_IR<10^11 Lsun) dominate the total luminosity
density and that the fraction of cold galaxies decreases with increasing
luminosity, becoming negligible at the highest luminosities. Conversely, above
z=0.1 we find that luminous IR galaxies (L_IR>10^11 Lsun), the majority of
which are cold, dominate the IR luminosity density. We therefore infer that
cold galaxies dominate the IR luminosity density across the whole 0<z<1 range,
hence appear to be the main driver behind the increase in SFR density up to z~1
whereas local luminous galaxies are not, on the whole, representative of the
high redshift population.

simulations of the FePt/Fe bilayer system. The FePt hard layer exhibits strong
perpendicular magnetocrystalline anisotropy, while the soft (Fe) layer has
negligible magnetocrystalline anisotropy. The variation of the local spin
orientation in the Fe layer is determined by the competition of the exchange
coupling interaction with the hard layer and the magnetostatic energy which
favours in-plane magnetisation. Dynamics were studied by monitoring the
response of the Fe layer magnetisation after the abrupt application of a
magnetic field which causes the systems to realign via precessional motion.
This precessional motion allows us to obtain the frequency spectrum and hence
examine the dynamical magnetisation motion. Since the rotation of the spins in
the soft layer does not have a well defined magnetic anisotropy, the system
does not present the usual frequency field characteristics for a thin film.
Additionally we obtain multi-peaked resonance spectra for the application of
magnetic fields perpendicular to the film plane, though we discount the
existence of spin wave modes and propose that this arises due to variations in
the local effective field across the Fe layer. The dynamic response is only
considered in the Fe layer, with the FePt layer held fixed in the perpendicular
orientation.

quantitatively predict the time required to achieve complete segregation is a
key test of our understanding of the segregation process. In this paper, we
apply the Gray-Thornton model of segregation (developed for linear shear
profiles) to a granular flow with an exponential profile, and evaluate its
ability to describe the observed segregation dynamics. Our experiment is
conducted in an annular Couette cell with a moving lower boundary. The granular
material is initially prepared in an unstable configuration with a layer of
small particles above a layer of large particles. Under shear, the sample mixes
and then re-segregates so that the large particles are located in the top half
of the system in the final state. During this segregation process, we measure
the velocity profile and use the resulting exponential fit as input parameters
to the model. To make a direct comparison between the continuum model and the
observed segregation dynamics, we locally map the measured height of the
experimental sample (which indicates the degree of segregation) to the local
packing density. We observe that the model successfully captures the presence
of a fast mixing process and relatively slower re-segregation process, but the
model predicts a finite re-segregation time, while in the experiment
re-segregation occurs only exponentially in time.

$[n]\times V(G)$, where for each edge $u v$ in $G$ there is an independent
uniform bijection $\pi$, and $H$ has all edges of the form $(i,u),(\pi(i),v)$.
A main motivation for studying lifts is understanding Ramanujan graphs, and
namely whether typical covers of such a graph are also Ramanujan.
  Let $G$ be a graph with largest eigenvalue $\lambda_1$ and let $\rho$ be the
spectral radius of its universal cover. Friedman (2003) proved that every ""new""
eigenvalue of a random lift of $G$ is $O(\rho^{1/2}\lambda_1^{1/2})$ with high
probability, and conjectured a bound of $\rho+o(1)$, which would be tight by
results of Lubotzky and Greenberg (1995). Linial and Puder (2008) improved
Friedman's bound to $O(\rho^{2/3}\lambda_1^{1/3})$. For $d$-regular graphs,
where $\lambda_1=d$ and $\rho=2\sqrt{d-1}$, this translates to a bound of
$O(d^{2/3})$, compared to the conjectured $2\sqrt{d-1}$.
  Here we analyze the spectrum of a random $n$-lift of a $d$-regular graph
whose nontrivial eigenvalues are all at most $\lambda$ in absolute value. We
show that with high probability the absolute value of every nontrivial
eigenvalue of the lift is $O((\lambda \vee \rho) \log \rho)$. This result is
tight up to a logarithmic factor, and for $\lambda \leq d^{2/3-\epsilon}$ it
substantially improves the above upper bounds of Friedman and of Linial and
Puder. In particular, it implies that a typical $n$-lift of a Ramanujan graph
is nearly Ramanujan.

important phenomenon, but the dynamics are highly nonlinear and visualization
of the surfactant dynamics has been a long-standing experimental challenge. We
perform the first quantitative, spatiotemporally-resolved measurements of the
spreading of an insoluble surfactant on a thin fluid layer. During the
spreading process, we directly observe both the radial height profile of the
spreading droplet and the spatial distribution of the fluorescently-tagged
surfactant. We find that the leading edge of spreading circular layer of
surfactant forms a Marangoni ridge in the underlying fluid, with a trough
trailing the ridge as expected. However, several novel features are observed
using the fluorescence technique, including a peak in the surfactant
concentration which trails the leading edge, and a flat, monolayer-scale
spreading film which differs from concentration profiles predicted by current
models. Both the Marangoni ridge and surfactant leading edge can be described
to spread as $R \propto t^{\delta}$. We find spreading exponents, $\delta_H
\approx 0.30$ and $\delta_\Gamma \approx 0.22$ for the ridge peak and
surfactant leading edge, respectively, which are in good agreement with
theoretical predictions of $\delta = 1/4$. In addition, we observe that the
surfactant leading edge initially leads the peak of the Marangoni ridge, with
the peak later catching up to the leading edge.

presented and analyzed. This scheme uses layered coding where the common layer
information is intended for both receivers and the refinement information is
destined only for one receiver. For the quadratic Gaussian case, a quantity
characterizing the overall quality of each receiver is identified in terms of
channel and side information parameters. It is shown that it is more

the presented scheme becomes optimal. Unlike its lossless counterpart, however,

moment along the ${\mathcal{C}}_2$symmetry axis of the molecule. The main aim
of the study is to identify molecular factors that can help stabilizing the
biaxial nematic phase. The phase diagrams involving isotropic ($I$), uniaxial
($N_U$) and biaxial ($N_B$) nematic phases are determined at given density and
dipole strength as function of bent angle. For molecules composed of two
uniaxial arms a direct $I-N_B$ phase transition is found at a single Landau
point, which moves towards lower bent angles with increasing dipole magnitude.
For the three-segment model strengthening of the dipole-dipole interaction
results in appearance of a line of Landau points. There exists an optimal
dipole strength for which this line covers the maximal range of opening angles.
Interestingly, the inclusion of biaxial GB ellipsoids as building blocks
reveals the direct $I-N_B$ transitions line even in a non-polar, two-arms
model. The line is shifted towards higher opening angles as compared to the
uniaxial case.

consider the set F(A) of all integer vectors b such that the associated
knapsack polytope P(A,b)={x: Ax=b, x>=0} contains an integer point. When m=1
the set F(A) is known to contain all consecutive integers greater than the
Frobenius number associated with A. In this paper we introduce the diagonal
Frobenius number g(A) which reflects in an analogous way feasibility properties
of the problem and the structure of F(A) in the general case. We give an
optimal upper bound for g(A) and also estimate the asymptotic growth of the
diagonal Frobenius number on average.

is necessary to examine the historical background since, only by following this
approach, do all the pieces of the puzzle fall into place. Here an attempt is
made to do this briefly and it is found that an interesting and important
question is raised. This question relates to the position of electromagnetism
in astronomical considerations since history indicates that, in the years
following the beginning of the 20th century, interest in electromagnetic
effects appeared to wane. Hence, following an examination of the history and
the presently accepted position where reliance for solutions seems confined to
examining gravitational effects, attention is turned to hypotheses based on
plasma physics to see if a more feasible solution to the problem of the missing
mass can be furnished utilising its fundamental ideas. While the purpose here
is to concentrate on dark matter and the supposed need for its introduction
into physics, this consideration of electromagnetic effects combined with the
realisation that most matter in the Universe is in the form of plasma also
indicates alternative routes to seeking solutions for other puzzling
astronomical phenomena.

quasi-periodic modulations. These timescales are much longer than any
""super-orbital"" periods reported hitherto and likely have a different origin.
We suggest here that they are due to long-term variations in the mass-transfer
rate from the donor, which are a consequence of solar-like magnetic cycles that
lead to orbital period changes (as proposed by Richman, Applegate & Patterson
1994 for similar long-term variations in CVs). Atoll sources display much
larger amplitude modulations than Z sources over these timescales, presumably
because Z sources are Eddington limited and hence unable to respond as readily
as Atoll sources to fluctuations in the mass-transfer rate from the donor.

the prompt sub-MeV emission has been detected from quite a few gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs) by Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) recently. A plausible scenario is
that this emission is the afterglow synchrotron emission produced by electrons
accelerated in the forward shocks. In this scenario, the electrons that produce
synchrotron high-energy emission also undergo inverse-Compton (IC) loss and the
IC scattering with the synchrotron photons should be in the Klein-Nishina
regime. Here we study effects of the Klein-Nishina scattering on the
high-energy synchrotron afterglow emission. We find that, at early times the
Klein-Nishina suppression effect on those electrons that produce the
high-energy emission is usually strong and therefore their inverse-Compton loss
is small with a Compton parameter Y < a few for a wide range of parameter
space. This leads to a relatively bright synchrotron afterglow at high energies
that can be detected by Fermi LAT. As the Klein-Nishina suppression effect
weakens with time, the inverse-Compton loss increases and could dominate over
the synchrotron loss in some parameter space. This will lead to a faster
temporal decay of the high-energy synchrotron emission than what is predicted
by the standard synchrotron model, which may explain the observed rapid decay
of the early high-energy gamma-ray emission in GRB090510 and GRB090902B.

kinds of multiferroic ground states, the $ab$-cycloidal, the $bc$-cycloidal,
and the collinear $E$-type phases, have been identified by the distinct ME
responses. The electric polarization of the $E$-type phase dominated by the
symmetric spin exchange ($bm{S}_{i} cdot bm{S}_{j}$) is more than 10 times as
large as that of the $bc$-cycloidal phase dominated by the antisymmetric one
($bm{S}_{i} times bm{S}_{j}$), and the ME response is enhanced near the
bicritical phase boundary between these multiferroic phases of different
origins. These findings will provide an important clue for the development of
the magnetically induced multiferroics.
