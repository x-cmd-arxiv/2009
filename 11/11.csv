near QCD critical point by a system of stochastic
Boltzmann-Langevin-Vlasov-type equations. We derive the equations and study the
system analytically in the linearized regime. Known results for equilibrium
stationary fluctuations as well as the critical scaling of diffusion
coefficient are reproduced. We apply the approach to the long-standing question
of the fate of the critical point fluctuations during the hadronic rescattering
stage of the heavy-ion collision after chemical freezeout. We find that if
conserved particle number fluctuations survive the rescattering, so do, under a
certain additional condition, the fluctuations of non-conserved quantities,
such as mean transverse momentum. We derive a simple analytical formula for the
magnitude of this ""memory"" effect.

accounting for survey biases, parameter degeneracies and systematic
uncertainties. We combine the cluster growth data with gas mass fraction, SNIa,
BAO and CMB data. This combination leads to a tight correlation between gamma
and sigma_8. Consistency with GR requires gamma~0.55. Under the assumption of
self-similar evolution and constant scatter in the scaling relations, and for a
flat LCDM model, we measure gamma(sigma_8/0.8)^6.8=0.55+0.13-0.10, with
0.79<sigma_8<0.89. Relaxing the assumptions on the scaling relations by
introducing two additional parameters to model possible evolution in the
normalization and scatter of the luminosity-mass relation, we obtain consistent
constraints on gamma that are only ~20% weaker than those above. Allowing the
dark energy equation of state, w, to take any constant value, we simultaneously
constrain the growth and expansion histories, and find no evidence for

composite, we discuss the effects of dimension-six operators on the Higgs boson
production at the LHC. When t_R is the only composite particle among the
Standard Model (SM) particles, the (V+A)\otimes (V+A) type four-top-quark
contact interaction is expected to have the largest coefficient among the
dimension-six operators, according to the Naive Dimensional Analysis (NDA). We
find that, to lowest order in QCD and other SM interactions, the cross section
of the SM Higgs boson production via gluon fusion does not receive corrections
from one insertion of the new contact interaction vertex. We also discuss the
effects of other dimension-six operators whose coefficients are expected to be
the second and the third largest from NDA. We find that the operator which
consists of two t_R's and two SM Higgs boson doublets can recognizably change
the Higgs boson production cross section from the SM prediction if the cut-off
scale is \sim 1TeV.

With the exception of one luminous X-ray source, we find that cluster XPSs are
hosted by passive red sequence galaxies, have X-ray colors consistent with an
AGN power-law spectrum, and have little intrinsic obscuring columns in the
X-ray (in agreement with previous studies). Our cluster radio sources have
properties similar to FR1s, but are not detected in X-ray probably because
their predicted X-ray emission falls below our sensitivity limits. Based on the
observational properties of our XPS population, we suggest that the cluster
XPSs are low-luminosity BL Lac objects, and thus are beamed low-power FR 1s.
Extrapolating the X-ray luminosity function of BL Lacs and the Radio luminosity
function of FR 1s down to fainter radio and X-ray limits, we estimate that a
large fraction, perhaps all CRSs with L>L* possess relativistic jets which can
inject energy into the ICM, potentially solving the uniform heating problem in

are computed with the STELEM code to study the sensitivity of the activity
cycle period and butterfly diagram to parameter changes and are compared to
observational data. The novelty is that these 2-D mean field dynamo models
incorporate scaling laws deduced from 3-D hydrodynamical simulations for the
influence of rotation rate on the amplitude and profile of the meridional
circulation. These models make also use of observational scaling laws for the
variation of differential rotation with rotation rate. Results: We find that
Babcock-Leighton flux transport dynamo models are able to reproduce the change
in topology of the magnetic field (i.e. toward being more toroidal with
increasing rotation rate) but seem to have difficulty reproducing the cycle
period vs activity period correlation observed in solar-like stars if a
monolithic single cell meridional flow is assumed. It may however be possible
to recover the $P_{cyc}$ vs $P_{rot}$ relation with more complex meridional
flows, if the profile changes in a particular assumed manner with rotation
rate. Conclusions: The Babcock-Leighton flux transport dynamo model based on
single cell meridional circulation does not reproduce the $P_{cyc}$ vs
$P_{rot}$ relation unless the amplitude of the meridional circulation is
assumed to increase with rotation rate which seems to be in contradiction with
recent results obtained with 3-D global simulations.

physico-chemical structure of protoplanetary disks and apply the Monte-Carlo
line radiative transfer code RATRAN to predict observable line profiles and
fluxes. We consider a series of Herbig Ae type disk models ranging from 10^-6
M_Sun to 2.2 10^-2 M_Sun (between 0.5 and 700 AU) to discuss the dependency of
the line fluxes and ratios on disk mass for otherwise fixed disk parameters.
Results. We find the [CII] 157.7 mum line to originate in LTE from the surface
layers of the disk, where Tg > Td . The total emission is dominated by surface
area and hence depends strongly on disk outer radius. The [OI] lines can be
very bright (> 10^-16 W/m^2) and form in slightly deeper and closer regions
under non-LTE conditions. The high-excitation [OI] 145.5 mum line, which has a
larger critical density, decreases more rapidly with disk mass than the 63.2
mum line. Therefore, the [OI] 63.2 mum/145.5 mum ratio is a promising disk mass
indicator, especially as it is independent of disk outer radius for Rout > 200
AU. CO is abundant only in deeper layers A_V >~ 0.05. For too low disk masses
(M_disk <~10^-4 M_Sun) the dust starts to become transparent, and CO is almost
completely photo-dissociated. For masses larger than that the lines are an
excellent independent tracer of disk outer radius and can break the outer
radius degeneracy in the [OI] 63.2 mum/[CII]157.7 mum line ratio. Conclusions.
The far-IR fine-structure lines of [CII] and [OI] observable with Herschel
provide a promising tool to measure the disk gas mass, although they are mainly
generated in the atomic surface layers. In spatially unresolved observations,
none of these lines carry much information about the inner, possibly hot
regions < 30 AU.

the presence of two massive companions to the solar-type star HD202206.
Although the three-body fit of the system is unstable, it was shown that a 5:1
mean motion resonance exists close to the best fit, where the system is stable.
  We present here an extensive dynamical study of the HD202206 system aiming at
constraining the inclinations of the two known companions, from which we derive
possible ranges of value for the companion masses.
  We study the long term stability of the system in a small neighborhood of the
best fit using Laskar's frequency map analysis. We also introduce a numerical
method based on frequency analysis to determine the center of libration mode
inside a mean motion resonance.
  We find that acceptable coplanar configurations are limited to inclinations
to the line of sight between 30 and 90 degrees. This limits the masses of both
companions to roughly twice the minimum. Non coplanar configurations are
possible for a wide range of mutual inclinations from 0 to 90 degrees, although
$\Delta\Omega = 0 [\pi]$ configurations seem to be favored. We also confirm the
5:1 mean motion resonance to be most likely. In the coplanar edge-on case, we
provide a very good stable solution in the resonance, whose $\chi^2$ does not
differ significantly from the best fit. Using our method to determine the
center of libration, we further refine this solution to obtain an orbit with a
very low amplitude of libration, as we expect dissipative effects to have
dampened the libration.

force microscopy (MFM). In the whole range of magnetic fields up to 9 T, vortex
pinning precludes the formation of an ordered Abrikosov lattice. Instead, a
vitreous vortex phase (vortex glass) with a short-range hexagonal order is
observed. Statistical processing of MFM datasets lets us directly measure its
radial and angular distribution functions and extract the radial correlation
length \zeta. In contrast to predictions of the collective pinning model, no
increase in the correlated volume with the applied field is observed. Instead,
we find that \zeta decreases as 1.3*R1 ~ H^(-1/2) over four decades of the
applied magnetic field, where R1 is the radius of the first coordination shell
of the vortex lattice. Such universal scaling of \zeta implies that the vortex
pinning in iron arsenides remains strong even in the absence of static
magnetism. This result is consistent with all the real- and reciprocal-space
vortex-lattice measurements in overdoped as-grown aFe_{2-x}Co_xAs_2 published

model suggests that the vortices remain in the single-vortex pinning limit even
in high magnetic fields up to 9 T.

the former and avoid significant fine tuning in the latter. We focus on an
NMSSM-like scenario where U(1)' gauge invariance is used to forbid a tree-level

electroweak symmetry breaking. Gaugino masses are somewhat lighter than the
scalar masses, and the third generation squarks are lighter than the first two.
In the specific class of models under consideration, the gluino is light since
it only receives a contribution from 2-loop anomaly mediation, and it decays
dominantly into third generation quarks. Gluino production leads to distinct
LHC signals and prospects of early discovery. In addition, there is a
relatively light Z', with mass in the range of several TeV. Discovering and

break galaxies (LBGs) at z ~ 3 to investigate systematically the relationship
between Lya emission and stellar populations. Lya equivalent widths (EW) were
calculated from rest-frame UV spectroscopy and optical/near-infrared/Spitzer
photometry was used in population synthesis modeling to derive the key
properties of age, dust extinction, star formation rate (SFR), and stellar
mass. We directly compare the stellar populations of LBGs with and without
strong Lya emission, where we designate the former group (EW > 20 AA) as Lya
emitters (LAEs) and the latter group (EW < 20 AA) as non-LAEs. This controlled
method of comparing objects from the same UV luminosity distribution represents
an improvement over previous studies in which the stellar populations of LBGs
and narrowband-selected LAEs were contrasted, where the latter were often
intrinsically fainter in broadband filters by an order of magnitude simply due
to different selection criteria. Using a variety of statistical tests, we find
that Lya equivalent width and age, SFR, and dust extinction, respectively, are
significantly correlated in the sense that objects with strong Lya emission
also tend to be older, lower in star formation rate, and less dusty than
objects with weak Lya emission, or the line in absorption. We accordingly
conclude that, within the LBG sample, objects with strong Lya emission
represent a later stage of galaxy evolution in which supernovae-induced
outflows have reduced the dust covering fraction. We also examined the
hypothesis that the attenuation of Lya photons is lower than that of the
continuum, as proposed by some, but found no evidence to support this picture.

z = 0.289 by the SuperMACHO microlensing survey, peaked at M_R = -21.5 mag and
only declined by 2.9 mag over 4.7 years after the peak. Over this period, SN
2003ma had an integrated bolometric luminosity of 4 x 10^51 ergs, more than any
other SN to date. The radiated energy is close to the limit allowed by
conventional core-collapse explosions. Optical spectra reveal that SN 2003ma
has persistent single-peaked intermediate-width hydrogen lines, a signature of
interaction between the SN and a dense circumstellar medium. The light curves
show further evidence for circumstellar interaction, including a long plateau
with a shape very similar to the classic SN IIn 1988Z -- however, SN 2003ma is
ten times more luminous at all epochs. The fast velocity measured for the
intermediate-width H_alpha component (~6000 km/s) points towards an extremely
energetic explosion (> 10^52 ergs), which imparts a faster blast-wave speed to
the post-shock material and a higher luminosity from the interaction than is
observed in typical SNe IIn. Mid-infrared observations of SN 2003ma suggest an
infrared light echo is produced by normal interstellar dust at a distance ~0.5

(B/T<~0.5) galaxy, forming stars at ~6Msol/yr. We use a robust sample of
multiply-imaged galaxies to constrain a parameterized model of the cluster mass
distribution. In addition to the main cluster dark matter halo and the bright
cluster galaxies, our best model includes three galaxy-group-sized halos. The
relative probability of this model is P(N_halo=4)/P(N_halo<4)>=10^12 where
N_halo is the number of cluster/group-scale halos. In terms of sheer number of

The identified optical counterpart has a spectroscopic redshift of
z=4.044+-0.001 if we attribute the single emission line detected at
lambda=6140AA to Lyman-alpha. This redshift identification is in good agreement
with the optical/near-infrared photometric redshift as well as the submm flux
ratio S_450/S_850~1.6, the radio-submm flux ratio S_1.4/S_850 < 0.004, and the
24um to 850um flux ratio S_24/S_850 < 0.005. Correcting for the gravitational
lensing amplification of ~5.5, we find that the source has a far-infrared
luminosity of 1.3x10^12 Lsun, which implies a star formation rate of 230
Msun/yr. This makes it the lowest-luminosity SMG known at z>4 to date. Previous
CO(4-3) emission line obserations yielded a non-detection, for which we derived
an upper limit of the CO line luminosity of L'_CO = 0.3x10^10 K km/s/pc^2,
which is not inconsistent with the L'_CO - L_FIR relation for starburst
galaxies. The best fit model to the optical and near-infrared photometry give a
stellar population with an age of 1.4 Gyr and a stellar mass of 1.6x10^10 Msun.
The optical morphology is compact and in the source plane the galaxy has an
extent of ~6kpc x 3kpc with individual star forming knots of <500 pc in size.
J163556 is not resolved in the SMA data and we place a strict upper limit on
the size of the starburst region of 8kpc x 3kpc, which implies a lower limit on
the star formation rate surface density of 12 Msun/yr/kpc^2. The redshift of
J163556 extends the redshift distribution of faint, lensed SMGs, and we find no

from the secondary is due to the surprisingly strong reflection effect. Light
curve modeling produced several solutions corresponding to different values of
the system mass ratio, q(M2/M1), but only one is consistent with a core helium
burning star, q=0.301. The orbital inclination is 86.6 degree. The sdB primary

unusually low mass for an sdB star. SdB stars with masses significantly lower
than the canonical value of 0.48 Msun, down to as low as 0.30 Msun, were
theoretically predicted by Han et al. (2002, 2003), but observational evidence
has only recently begun to confirm the existence of such stars. The existence
of core helium burning stars with masses lower than 0.40--0.43 Msun implies
that at least some sdB progenitors have initial main sequence masses of
1.8--2.0 Msun or more, i.e. they are at least main sequence A stars. The
secondary is a main sequence M5 star.

that the adsorbate phase can be divided into identical and non-interacting
effective subsystems. This gives rise to a simple multiparametric isotherm
based on the grand canonical ensemble statistics, whose functional form is a
ratio of two polynomial functions. The parameters are interpreted as effective
equilibrium constants. A simplified isotherm that reduces the number of
adjustable parameters with respect to the general isotherm is also proposed. We
show how to use these isotherms to fit the adsorption data in such way that the
parameters have statistical significance. Due to their high accuracy, both
isotherms can be used to estimate thermodynamic properties like isosteric and
differential heats of adsorption. A simple method is presented for systems that
show an apparent variation in the coverage limit with temperature. This method
avoids overparametrization and improves fitting deviations. Finally, several
applications to fitting data, taken from literature, of adsorption of some
gases on activated carbon, molecular sieving carbon, silica gel, and pillared

of helioseismic normal modes. It does, however, Doppler shift the local
wavenumber, thereby distorting the eigenfunctions. For high-degree modes, whose
peaks in a power spectrum are blended into continuous ridges, the effect of the
distortion is to shift the locations of those ridges. From this blended
superposition of modes, one can isolate oppositely directed wave components
with the same local horizontal wavenumber and measure a frequency difference
which can be safely used to infer the subsurface background flow. But such a
procedure fails for the components of the more-deeply-penetrating low-degree
modes that are not blended into ridges. Instead, one must analyze the spatial
distortions explicitly. With a simple toy model, we illustrate one method by
which that might be accomplished by measuring the spatial variation of the
oscillation phase. We estimate that by this procedure it might be possible to
infer meridional flow deep in the solar convection zone.

I contrast this value with that produced by simpler models based on body sizes

on allometric scaling and optimal foraging does not significantly increase the
fit to the data. Also, I take a different approach and compute the p-value for

emission from the jet photosphere combined with non-thermal emission described
by a single power-law with photon index -1.9. The photosphere gives rise to a
strong quasi-blackbody spectrum which is somewhat broader than a single Planck
function and has a characteristic temperature of ~290keV. We derive the
photospheric radius Rph = (1.1 \pm 0.3) x 10^12 Y^{1/4} cm and the bulk Lorentz
factor of the flow, which is found to vary by a factor of two and has a maximal
value of Gamma = 750 Y^{1/4}. Here Y is the ratio between the total fireball
energy and the energy emitted in the gamma-rays. We find that during the first
quarter of the prompt phase the photospheric emission dominates, which explains
the delayed onset of the observed flux in the LAT compared to the GBM. We model
the photospheric emission with a multi-color blackbody and its shape indicates
that the photospheric radius increases at higher latitudes. We interpret the
broad band emission as synchrotron emission at R ~ 4x10^15 cm. Our analysis

from the metal contact as x^{-1/2} and x^{-1} for undoped and doped graphene,
respectively, breaking its spatial homogeneity. In the contact region the metal
contact can give rise to the formation of a p-p', n-n', p-n junction (or with
additional gating or impurity doping, even a p-n-p' junction) that contributes
to the overall resistance of the graphene sample, destroying its electron-hole

logarithm $\ln M(\omega) $ is due to the fact that it yields the 'effective'
matrix $Q_{eff}(\omega) $ of the dynamic-homogenization method. For the typical
case of a unimodular matrix $M(\omega)$ ($\det M=1$), it is established that
the components of $\ln M(\omega) $ diverge as $(\omega -\omega_0)^{-1/2}$ with
$\omega \to \omega_0,$ where $\omega_0$ is the set of frequencies of the
passband/stopband crossovers at the edges of the first Brillouin zone. The
divergence disappears for a homogeneous medium. Mathematical and physical
aspects of this observation are discussed. Explicit analytical examples of
$Q_{eff}(\omega) $ and of its diverging asymptotics at $\omega \to \omega_0$
are provided for a model of scalar waves in a two-component periodic structure.
The case of high contrast due to stiff/soft layers or soft springs is

deviation from it. This scheme enables us to solve the centrifugal balance of a
gas disk against gravity with better accuracy, since the former inertia force
cancels the gravity. It is applied to circumbinary disk rotating around binary
of which primary and secondary has mass ratio, 1.4:0.95. The gravity is reduced
artificially softened only in small circular regions around the primary and
secondary. The radii are 7% of the binary separation and much smaller than
those in the previous grid based simulations. 7 Models are constructed to study
dependence on the gas temperature and the initial inner radius of the disk. The
gas accretion shows both fast and slow time variations while the binary is
assumed to have a circular orbit. The time variation is due to oscillation of
spiral arms in the circumbinary disk. The masses of primary and secondary disks
increase while oscillating appreciably. The mass accretion rate tends to be
higher for the primary disk although the secondary disk has a higher accretion
rate in certain periods. The primary disk is perturbed intensely by the impact
of gas flow so that the outer part is removed. The secondary disk is quiet in

sources were detected in all three bands. The near-IR polarizations of these

color-color diagram, reddened sources with little infrared excess were selected
to trace the magnetic field structure of the molecular cloud. The mean
polarization position angle of these sources is about 111 deg, which is
interpreted as the projected direction of the magnetic field in the observed
region of the cloud. The distribution of the polarization angle has a
dispersion of about 11 deg, which is smaller than what was measured in previous

magnetic field to be about 130 microG and suggests that the global magnetic
field in this region is quite regular and straight. In contrast, the outflows
driven by young stellar objects in this region seem to have no preferred

Cooperation among receivers can help mitigate interference by forming
distributed MIMO systems. The rate at which receivers cooperate, however, is
limited in most scenarios. How much interference can one bit of receiver
cooperation mitigate? In this paper, we study the two-user Gaussian
interference channel with conferencing decoders to answer this question in a
simple setting. We identify two regions regarding the gain from receiver
cooperation: linear and saturation regions. In the linear region receiver
cooperation is efficient and provides a degrees-of-freedom gain, which is
either one cooperation bit buys one more bit or two cooperation bits buy one
more bit until saturation. In the saturation region receiver cooperation is
inefficient and provides a power gain, which is at most a constant regardless
of the rate at which receivers cooperate. The conclusion is drawn from the
characterization of capacity region to within two bits. The proposed strategy
consists of two parts: (1) the transmission scheme, where superposition
encoding with a simple power split is employed, and (2) the cooperative
protocol, where one receiver quantize-bin-and-forwards its received signal, and
the other after receiving the side information decode-bin-and-forwards its
received signal.

means of a fugacity term as in the Strauss (or ""triangle"") model, but where the
degree sequence is strictly preserved -- thus maintaining the quenched
heterogeneity of nodes found in the original degree sequence. Similar models
had been proposed previously in [R. Milo et al., Science 298, 824 (2002)]. We
find that our model exhibits phase transitions as the fugacity is changed. For
regular graphs (identical degrees for all nodes) with degree k > 2 we find a
single first order transition. For all non-regular networks that we studied
(including Erdos - Renyi and scale-free networks) we find multiple jumps
resembling first order transitions, together with strong hysteresis. The latter
transitions are driven by the sudden emergence of ""cluster cores"": groups of
highly interconnected nodes with higher than average degrees. To study these
cluster cores visually, we introduce q-clique adjacency plots. We find that
these cluster cores constitute distinct communities which emerge spontaneously
from the triangle generating process. Finally, we point out that cluster cores
produce pitfalls when using the present (and similar) models as null models for
strongly clustered networks, due to the very strong hysteresis which
effectively leads to broken ergodicity on realistic time scales.

central degree of our Galaxy. It has been cited as evidence for a mass outflow
from our GC region, which has inspired diverse models for its origin. However,
most work has focused on the morphology of the GC lobe, which has made it
difficult to draw strong conclusions about its nature. Here, I present a
coherent, multiwavelength analysis of new and archival observations of the GC
lobe. Radio continuum emission shows that the GC lobe has a magnetized layer
with a diameter of 110 pc and an equipartition field strength ranging from 40
to 100 $\mu$G. Recombination line emission traces an ionized shell nested
within the radio continuum with diameter of 80 pc and height 165 pc.
Mid-infrared maps at 8 and 15 $\mu$m show that the GC lobe has a third layer of
warm dust and PAH-emission that surrounds the radio continuum shell with a
diameter of 130 pc. Assuming adiabatic expansion of the gas in the GC lobe, its
formation required an energy input of about $5\times10^{52}$ ergs. I compare
the physical conditions of the GC lobe to several models and find best
agreement with the canonical starburst outflow model. The formation of the GC
lobe is consistent with the currently observed pressure and star formation rate
in the central tens of parsecs of our Galaxy. Outflows of this scale are more
typical of dwarf galaxies and would not be easily detected in nearby spiral
galaxies. Thus, the existence of such an outflow in our own Galaxy may indicate
that it is relatively common phenomenon in the nuclei of spiral galaxies.

interior is explored. Since there is $^3$P$_2$ neutron superfluid in neutron
star interior, it can be treated as a system of magnetic dipoles. Under the
presence of background magnetic field, the magnetic dipoles tend to align in
the same direction. Below a critical temperature, there is a phase transition
from paramagnetism to ferromagnetism. And this gives a convenient explanation
of the strong magnetic field of magnetars. In our point of view, there is an
upper limit for the magnetic field strength of magnetars. The maximum field
strength of magnetars is about $(3.0-4.0)\times 10^{15}$ G. This can be tested
directly by further investigations.
  Magnetars are instable due to the ultra high Fermi energy of electrons. The
Landau column becomes a very long cylinder along the magnetic field, but it is
very narrow and the Fermi energy of electron gas is given as
$E_F(e)\approx40(B/B_{cr})^{1/4}$ when $B\gg B_{cr}$. $E_F(e)\approx90MeV$ When
$B\sim10^{15}$ G. Hence, the electron capture process $e^-+p\to n+\nu_e$ will
be happen rapidly. Thus the $^3$P$_2$ Cooper pairs will be destroyed quickly by
the outgoing neutrons with high energy. It will cause the isotropic superfluid
disappear and then the magnetic field induced by the $^3$P$_2$ Cooper pairs
will be also disappear. These energy will immediately be transmitted into
thermal energy and then transformed into the radiation energy with X-ray - soft
$\gamma$-ray. We may get a conclusion that the activity of magnetars originates
from instability caused by the high Fermi energy of electrons in extra strong
magnetic field.

transition from inflationary to a radiation and matter dominated epoch
respectively. We assume that the perturbations are generated by the vacuum
fluctuations of a scalar field slowly rolling down its potential, and that the
transition into the subsequent epoch takes place much faster than a Hubble
time. The behaviour of the superhorizon perturbations corresponding to
cosmological scales in this case is well known. However, it is not clear how
perturbations on scales of and smaller than the Hubble horizon scale at the end
of inflation may evolve through such a transition. We derive the evolution
equation for the gravitational potential $\Psi$, which allows us to study the
evolution of the perturbations on all scales under these circumstances. We show
that for a certain range of scales inside the horizon at the end of inflation,
the amplitude of the perturbations are enhanced relative to the superhorizon

traffic demand, it becomes a general belief that a new generation data network
is in urgent need today. However, standing at this crossroad, we find that we
are in a situation that lacks a theory of network designing. This issue becomes
even more serious as the recent progress of network measurement and modeling
challenges the foundation of network research in the past decades.
  This paper tries to set up a scientific foundation for network designing by
formalizing it as a multi-objective optimization process and quantifying the
way different designing choices independently and collectively influence these
objectives. A cartesian coordinate system is introduced to map the effect of
each designing scheme to a coordinate. We investigated the achievable area of
the network designing space and proved some boundary conditions. It is shown
that different kind of networks display different shapes of achievable areas in
the cartesian coordinate and exhibit different abilities to achieve
cost-effective and scalable designing. In particular, we found that the
philosophy underlying current empirical network designing and engineering fails
to meet the cost-effective and evolvable requirements of network designing. We
demonstrated that the efficient routing combined with effective betweenness
based link bandwidth allocation scheme is a cost-effective and scalable design
for BA-like scale-free networks, whereas if other designing choices cannot be
determined beforehand, ER network is a markedly good candidate for
cost-effective and scalable design.

contain numerous paradoxes, many scientists doubt their internal consistencies.
However, these paradoxes can be resolved within the framework of the existing
physics without the introduction of new laws. To clarify the paper for the
inexperienced reader, we include certain necessary basic concepts of
statistical physics and quantum mechanics in this paper without the use of

text is supplemented by illustrations to enhance the understanding of the
paper. The paradoxes underlying thermodynamics and quantum mechanics are also
discussed. The approaches to the solutions of these paradoxes are suggested.
The first approach is dependent on the influence of the external observer
(environment), which disrupts the correlations in the system. The second
approach is based on the limits of the self-knowledge of the system for the
case in which both the external observer and the environment are included in
the considered system. The concepts of observable dynamics, ideal dynamics, and
unpredictable dynamics are introduced. The phenomenon of complex (living)
systems is contemplated from the point of view of these dynamics.

behavior as functions of the characteristics of magnetic field profiles. The
magnetic field profiles with rather small spatial scales $d$ and modulation
amplitudes $H_0$ such that $H_0d^2\ll\hbar c/e$ are characterized by the
dephasing rate $\tau_H^{-1}\propto H_0^2d^2$. The increase in the flux value
$H_0d^2$ results in a crossover to a standard linear dependence
$\tau_H^{-1}\propto H_0$. Applying an external homogeneous magnetic field $H$
one can vary the local dephasing time in the system and affect the resulting
average transport characteristics. We have investigated the dependence of the
average resistance vs the field $H$ for some generic systems and predict a
possibility to observe a positive magnetoresistance at not too large $H$
values. The resulting dependence of the resistance vs $H$ should reveal a peak

the adaptive biasing potential (ABP) framework. By mollifying the density of
states we obtain an approximate free energy and an adaptive bias potential that
is computed directly from the population along the coordinates of the free
energy. Because of the mollifier, the bias potential is ""nonlocal"" and its
gradient admits a simple analytic expression. A single observation of the
reaction coordinate can thus be used to update the approximate free energy at
every point within a neighborhood of the observation. This greatly reduces the
equilibration time of the adaptive bias potential. This approximation
introduces two parameters: strength of mollification and the zero of energy of
the bias potential. While we observe that the approximate free energy is a very
good estimate of the actual free energy for a large range of mollification
strength, we demonstrate that the errors associated with the mollification may
be removed via deconvolution. The zero of energy of the bias potential, which
is easy to choose, influences the speed of convergence but not the limiting
accuracy. This method is simple to apply to free energy or mean force
computation in multiple dimensions and does not involve second derivatives of
the reaction coordinates, matrix manipulations nor on-the-fly adaptation of
parameters. For the alanine dipeptide test case, the new method is found to
gain as much as a factor of ten in efficiency as compared to two common
adaptive biasing force formulations and it is shown to be as efficient as
well-tempered metadynamics with the post-process deconvolution giving a clear
advantage to the mollified density of states method.

paying a special attention to the region of emitted protons having kinetic
energy above 600 MeV, which was used to claim a deep kaon nucleus optical
potential [1]. The experiment looks for fast protons emitted from the
absorption of in flight kaons by nuclei, but in coincidence with at least one
charged particle in the decay counters sandwiching the target. The analysis of
the data is done in [1] assuming that the coincidence requirement does not
change the shape of the final spectra. However our detailed calculations show
that this assumption doesn't hold, and, thus, the final conclusion of this
experiment is doubtful.
  We perform Monte Carlo simulation of this reaction. The advantage of our
method with respect to Green's function method used in [1] is that it allows to
account not only for quasi-elastic K- p scattering, but also for the other
processes which contribute to the proton spectra. We investigated the effect of
the multi-scatterings and of the K- absorptions by one and two nucleons (K- N
--> pi Y and K- N N --> Y N) followed by the decay of the hyperon in pi N. We
show that all these mechanisms allow us to explain reasonably well the observed
spectrum with standard shallow kaon nucleus optical potential, obtained in
chiral models.

$M_p(\Sigma)$ and the integrability exponent $p$, and \emph{not} on the surface

proving upper bounds on the choice number of graphs (and thus, in particular,
upper bounds on their chromatic number). The upper bound on the choice number
of $G$ obtained via their method, was later coined the \emph{Alon-Tarsi number
of $G$} and was denoted by $AT(G)$. They have provided a combinatorial
interpretation of this parameter in terms of the eulerian subdigraphs of an
appropriate orientation of $G$. Their characterization can be restated as
follows. Let $D$ be an orientation of $G$. Assign a weight $\omega_D(H)$ to
every subdigraph $H$ of $D$: if $H \subseteq D$ is eulerian, then $\omega_D(H)
= (-1)^{e(H)}$, otherwise $\omega_D(H) = 0$. Alon and Tarsi proved that $AT(G)
\leq k$ if and only if there exists an orientation $D$ of $G$ in which the
out-degree of every vertex is strictly less than $k$, and moreover $\sum_{H
\subseteq D} \omega_D(H) \neq 0$. Shortly afterwards, for the special case of
line graphs of $d$-regular $d$-edge-colorable graphs, Alon gave another
interpretation of $AT(G)$, this time in terms of the signed $d$-colorings of
the line graph. In this paper we generalize both results. The first
characterization is generalized by showing that there is an infinite family of
weight functions (which includes the one considered by Alon and Tarsi), each of
which can be used to characterize $AT(G)$. The second characterization is
generalized to all graphs (in fact the result is even more general -- in
particular it applies to hypergraphs). We then use the second generalization to
prove that $\chi(G) = ch(G) = AT(G)$ holds for certain families of graphs $G$.
Some of these results generalize certain known choosability results.

a Co atom absorbed on top of a carbon atom, the Kondo effect is quenched by
spin-orbit coupling below an energy scale of $\sim 15$\,K. For Co with spin
$S=1/2$ located in the center of a hexagon, an SU(4) Kondo model describes the
entanglement of orbital moment and spin at higher energies, while below \sim

The interplay of the orbital Co physics and the peculiar band-structure of
graphene is directly accessible in Fourier transform tunneling spectroscopy or

strong, characteristic particle-hole asymmetry.

Centaurus A obtained over almost 20 years at the VLA and with Chandra, with
which we measure the X-ray and radio spectral indices of jet knots, flux
density variations in the jet knots, polarization variations, and proper
motions. We compare the observed properties with current knot formation models
and particle acceleration mechanisms. We rule out impulsive particle
acceleration as a formation mechanism for all of the knots as we detect the
same population of knots in all of the observations and we find no evidence of
extreme variability in the X-ray knots. We find the most likely mechanism for
all the stationary knots is a collision resulting in a local shock followed by
a steady state of prolonged, stable particle acceleration and X-ray synchrotron
emission. In this scenario, the X-ray-only knots have radio counterparts that
are too faint to be detected, while the radio-only knots are due to weak shocks
where no particles are accelerated to X-ray emitting energies. Although the
base knots are prime candidates for reconfinement shocks, the presence of a
moving knot in this vicinity and the fact that there are two base knots are
hard to explain in this model. We detect apparent motion in three knots;
however, their velocities and locations provide no conclusive evidence for or
against a faster moving `spine' within the jet. The radio-only knots, both
stationary and moving, may be due to compression of the fluid.

has been to reconcile quantum mechanics with general relativity into a theory
of quantum gravity. However, such a theory has been proved to be hard to attain
due to i) conceptual difficulties present in both the component theories
(General Relativity (GR) and Quantum Theory); ii) lack of experimental
evidence, since the regimes at which quantum gravity is expected to be
applicable are far beyond the range of conceivable experiments. Despite these
difficulties, various approaches for a theory of Quantum Gravity have been
developed.
  In this thesis we focus on two such approaches: Loop Quantum Gravity and the
Topos theoretic approach. The choice fell on these approaches because, although
they both reject the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory, their
underpinning philosophical approach to formulating a quantum theory of gravity
are radically different. In particular LQG is a rather conservative scheme,
inheriting all the formalism of both GR and Quantum Theory, as it tries to
bring to its logical extreme consequences the possibility of combining the two.
On the other hand, the Topos approach involves the idea that a radical change
of perspective is needed in order to solve the problem of quantum gravity,
especially in regard to the fundamental concepts of `space' and `time'. Given
the partial successes of both approaches, the hope is that it might be possible
to find a common ground in which each approach can enrich the other.

future applications in photonics and quantum information. Two important
man-made classes of materials have emerged to mold the flow of electromagnetic
waves. Firstly, photonic crystals are dielectric nanostructures that can be
used to confine and slow down light and control its emission. They act
primarily on the electric component of the light field. More recently, a novel
class of metallo-dielectric nanostructures has emerged. These so-called
metamaterials enable fascinating phenomena, such as negative refraction,
super-focusing and cloaking. This second class of materials realizes light
control through effective interactions with both electric and magnetic
component. In this work, we combine both concepts to gain an active and
reversible control of light trapping on subwavelength length scales. By
actuating a nanoscale magnetic coil close to a photonic crystal nanocavity, we
interact with the rapidly varying magnetic field and accomplish an
unprecedented control of the optical properties of the cavity. We achieve a
reversible enhancement of the lifetime of photons in the cavity. By
successfully combining photonic crystal and metamaterials concepts, our results
open the way for new light control strategies based on interactions which

S_1=S_2=1/2 case, where the moments are Kondo screened successively in two
stages for J<T_K^(0) (the ``two-stage Kondo effect''). We show that the
two-stage Kondo screening occurs generically for S_2 >= S_1. For S_1 >= 1, the
second Kondo temperature T_K^(2) is not exponentially reduced, as for S_1 =
1/2, but is approximately a power-law function of the coupling J. Furthermore,

no second stage of screening for J<T_K^(0), however in the opposite limit

regular graphs with no triangles such that the second subconstituent is also
strongly regular. The method also provides an effective means of listing
feasible parameters for such graphs.

  matrices","Revised version: references added to the published version","Phys. Rev. E 81, 036701 (2010)","10.1103/PhysRevE.81.036701",,"nlin.CD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We discuss several techniques for the evaluation of the generalised Lyapunov
exponents which characterise the growth of products of random matrices in the
large-deviation regime. A Monte Carlo algorithm that performs importance
sampling using a simple random resampling step is proposed as a general-purpose
numerical method which is both efficient and easy to implement. Alternative
techniques complementing this method are presented. These include the
computation of the generalised Lyapunov exponents by solving numerically an
eigenvalue problem, and some asymptotic results corresponding to high-order
moments of the matrix products. Taken together, the techniques discussed in
this paper provide a suite of methods which should prove useful for the
evaluation of the generalised Lyapunov exponents in a broad range of
applications. Their usefulness is demonstrated on particular products of random
matrices arising in the study of scalar mixing by complex fluid flows.

generalization of Darboux-Crum transformation. We also consider conservation of
monodromy with respect to the transformations.
