detection experiments and points to a non-minimal structure in the dark matter
sector. In addition to the dominant inelastic interaction, dark matter
scattering may have a subdominant elastic component. If these elastic
interactions are suppressed at low momentum transfer, they will have similar
nuclear recoil spectra to inelastic scattering events. While upcoming direct
detection experiments will see strong signals from such models, they may not be
able to unambiguously determine the presence of the subdominant elastic
scattering from the recoil spectra alone. We show that directional detection
experiments can separate elastic and inelastic scattering events and discover
the underlying dynamics of dark matter models.

to the question as to how the Kondo effect gets destroyed as the system

R-parity is broken spontaneously when the sneutrinos associated with the one

We show that our model can comfortably explain all the existing neutrino

Its classical action $S={1\over 2}\int_{S^4} dV (\nabla \phi)^2$ is degenerate
under the global invariance $\phi \to \phi + \hbox{constant}$. We then quantize
the massless scalar field as a gauge theory by constructing a BRST-invariant
quantum action. The corresponding gauge-breaking term is a non-local one of the
form $S^{\rm GB}={1\over {2\alpha V}}\bigl(\int_{S^4} dV \phi \bigr)^2$ where
$\alpha$ is a gauge parameter and $V$ is the volume of $S^4$. It allows us to
correctly treat the zero mode problem. The quantum theory is invariant under
SO(5), the symmetry group of $S^4$, and the associated two-point functions have
no infrared divergence. The well-known infrared divergence which appears by
taking the massless limit of the massive scalar field propagator is therefore a
gauge artifact. By contrast, the massless scalar field theory on de Sitter
space $dS^4$ - the lorentzian version of $S^4$ - is not invariant under the
symmetry group of that spacetime SO(1,4). Here, the infrared divergence is
real. Therefore, the massless scalar quantum field theories on $S^4$ and $dS^4$
cannot be linked by analytic continuation. In this case, because of zero modes,
the euclidean approach to quantum field theory does not work. Similar
considerations also apply to massive scalar field theories for exceptional
values of the mass parameter (corresponding to the discrete series of the de
Sitter group).

defining a new connection via helical motions. We describe this geometric

torque. We discuss where in physics the helical staircase is realized: (i) In
the continuum mechanics of Cosserat media, (ii) in (fairly speculative) 3d
theories of gravity, namely a) in 3d Einstein-Cartan gravity - this is Cartan's
case of constant pressure and constant intrinsic torque - and b) in 3d Poincare

locally (e.g. counting heads within a rectangle) suffer from large data
scatter. The remedy of averaging over large spaces or long times reduces the
possible resolution and inhibits the gain obtained by the new technologies.
  In this contribution we introduce a concept for measuring microscopic
characteristics on the basis of pedestrian trajectories. Assigning a personal
space to every pedestrian via a Voronoi diagram reduces the density scatter.
Similarly, calculating direction and speed from position differences between
times with identical phases of movement gives low-scatter sequences for speed
and direction. Closing we discuss the methods to obtain reliable values for
derived quantities and new possibilities of in depth analysis of experiments.

ratios and conversion rates of the LFV processes are calculated to leading

that there is some tension and, in order to be within the limits, one requires
a higher breaking scale f, alignment of the heavy and light lepton sectors or
almost degenerate heavy lepton masses. These constraints are more demanding in
the SLH than in the LHT case.

heliosheath and outer heliosphere (OH) based on self-consistent two-dimensional
fluid simulations. The model describes a partially ionized magnetofluid OH that
couples a neutral hydrogen fluid with a plasma primarily through
charge-exchange interactions. Charge-exchange interactions are ubiquitous in
warm heliospheric plasma, and the strength of the interaction depends largely
on the relative speed between the plasma and the neutral fluid. Unlike
small-length scale linear collisional dissipation in a single fluid,
charge-exchange processes introduce channels that can be effective on a variety
of length scales that depend on the neutral and plasma densities, temperature,
relative velocities, charge-exchange cross section, and the characteristic
length scales. We find, from scaling arguments and nonlinear coupled fluid
simulations, that charge-exchange interactions modify spectral transfer
associated with large-scale energy-containing eddies. Consequently, the
turbulent cascade rate prolongs spectral transfer among inertial range
turbulent modes. Turbulent spectra associated with the neutral and plasma
fluids are therefore steeper than those predicted by Kolmogorov's
phenomenology. Our work is important in the context of the global heliospheric
interaction, the energization and transport of cosmic rays, gamma-ray bursts,
interstellar density spectra, etc. Furthermore, the plasma-neutral coupling is

provides consumers with a loosely coupled way of interacting with providers.
The current feed model is limited in its capabilities, however. Though it is
simple to implement and scales well, it cannot be transferred to a wider range
of application scenarios. This paper conceptualizes feeds as a way to serialize
query results, describes the current hardcoded query semantics of such a
perspective, and surveys the ways in which extensions of this hardcoded model
have been proposed or implemented. Our generalized view of feeds as query
result serializations has implications for the applicability of feeds as a
generic Web service for any collection that is providing access to individual
information items. As one interesting and compelling class of applications, we
describe a simple way in which a query-based approach to feeds can be used to
support location-based services.

intrinsic length scale in whistler wave turbulence that distinguishably divides
the high frequency solar wind turbulent spectra into scales smaller and bigger

dependent, fluid simulations of whistler wave turbulence to investigate their
role in solar wind plasma. Our simulations find that the dispersive whistler

whistler wave effects are stronger in the large scale regime, they do not
influence the spectral cascades which are describable by a Kolmogorov-like
$k^{-7/3}$ spectrum. By contrast, the small scale turbulent fluctuations
exhibit a Navier-Stokes like evolution where characteristic turbulent eddies
exhibit a typical $k^{-5/3}$ hydrodynamic turbulent spectrum. By virtue of
equipartition between the wave velocity and magnetic fields, we quantify the
role of whistler waves in the solar wind plasma fluctuations.

recurrence relations are obtained from the invariance under Pachner moves and

holonomy operators on spin network functionals, making a more precise link
between the topological Pachner moves and the classical constraints.
Interestingly, our recurrence relations apply to any SU(2) invariant symbol,
depending on the cycles of the corresponding spin network graph. Another method
is used for non-topological objects such as the 10j-symbol and pseudo-isoceles
6j-symbols. The recurrence relations are also interpreted in terms of
elementary geometric properties. Finally, we discuss the extension of the
recurrences to take into account boundary states which leads to equations

large-deformation matching of one closed curve to another embedded in the same

comprises the space of closed curves $S^1$ embedded in the plane
$\mathbb{R}^2$. The diffeomorphic left action $\Diff(\mathbb{R}^2)$ deforms the
curve by a smooth invertible time-dependent transformation of the coordinate
system in which it is embedded, while leaving the parameterisation of the curve
invariant. The diffeomorphic right action $\Diff(S^1)$ corresponds to a smooth
invertible reparameterisation of the $S^1$ domain coordinates of the curve. As
we show, this right action unlocks an important degree of freedom for
geodesically matching the curve shapes using an equivalent fixed boundary value
problem, without being constrained to match corresponding points along the
template and target curves at the endpoint in time.

gas beyond the borders of the bi-cone, within a sphere with 1arcsec radius
around the nucleus. The ionised gas has three kinematic components: (1) one
observed at the systemic velocity and interpreted as originating in the galaxy
disk; (2) one outflowing along the bi-cone, with line-of-sight velocities
between -600 and 600 km/s and strongest emission at +/-(100-300)km/s; (3) and
another component due to the interaction of the radio jet with ambient gas. The
mass outflow rate, estimated to be 1 M_Sun/yr along each cone, exceeds the
inferred black hole accretion rate by a factor of 100. There is no evidence in
our data for the gradual acceleration followed by gradual deceleration proposed

distinct kinematics relative to the ionised gas. Its emission arises in
extended regions approximately perpendicular to the axis of the bi-cone and
along the axis of the galaxy's stellar bar, avoiding the innermost ionised
regions. It does not show an outflowing component, being observed only at
velocities very close to systemic, and is thus consistent with an origin in the

a modest temperature inversion, intermediate between the archetype inverted

suggest that this planet is radiating a large fraction of the available stellar
irradiance on its dayside, with little available for redistribution by
circulation. This planet has sometimes been speculated to be inflated by tidal
dissipation, based on its large radius in discovery observations, and on a
non-zero orbital eccentricity allowed by the radial velocity data. The timing
of the secondary eclipse is very sensitive to orbital eccentricity, and we find
that the central phase of the eclipse is 0.4999 +/- 0.0005. The difference

the Zel'dovich approximation, and then specifying the location and mass of
collapsed dark matter halos using the excursion-set formalism. The location of
ionizing sources and the time evolving distribution of ionization field is also

temperature evolution through the coupling between spin and gas temperature due
to collisions, radiative coupling in the presence of Lyman-alpha photons and
heating of the intergalactic medium, such as due to a background of X-ray
photons. The hybrid simulation method we present is capable of producing the

Hubble Time. We derive instantaneous torque maps for a sample of 24 spiral
galaxies, based on stellar mass maps that were derived using the pixel-by-pixel
mass-to-light estimator by Zibetti, Rix and Charlot. In conjunction with an
estimate of the rotation velocity, the mass maps allow us to determine the
torque-induced instantaneous angular momentum flow across different radii,
resulting from the overall stellar distributions for each galaxy in the sample.
By stacking the sample, which effectively replaces a time average by an
ensemble average, we find that the torques due to the stellar disk act to
transport angular momentum outward over much of the disk (within 3 disk scale
lengths). The strength of the ensemble-averaged gravitational torques within
one disk scale length have a timescale of ~ 4 Gyr for angular momentum
redistribution. This study is the first to observationally determine the
strength of torque-driven angular momentum flow of stars for a sample of spiral
galaxies, providing an important empirical constraint on secular evolution.

thought of either as stars or as dark matter particles. If a rigorous steady
state is assumed, then the system is infinite and is described by a universal
distribution function given the self-similar index. The steady logarithmic
potential case is exceptional and yields the familiar Gaussian for an infinite
system with an inverse-square density profile. We show subsequently that for
time-dependent radial self-similar infall, the logarithmic case is accurately
described by the Fridmann and Polyachenko distribution function. The system in
this case is finite but growing. We are able to embed a central mass in the
universal steady distribution only by iteration, except in the case of massless
particles. The iteration yields logarithmic corrections to the massless
particle case and requires a `renormalization' of the central mass. A central
spherical mass may be accurately embedded in the Fridmann and Polyachenko

importance of radial collisionless infall in actual galaxy formation.

central object and the surroundings. Methods: To study the environment of a
growing black hole we seek descriptions of steady `cusps' that may contain a
black hole and that retain at least a memory of self-similarity. We refer to
the environment in brief as the `bulge' and on smaller scales, the `halo'.
Results: We find simple descriptions of the simulations of collisionless matter
by comparing predicted densities, velocity dispersions and distribution
functions with the simulations. In some cases central point masses may be
included by iteration. We emphasize that the co-eval self-similar growth allows
an explanation of the black hole bulge mass correlation between approximately
similar collisionless systems. Conclusions: We have derived our results from
first principles assuming adiabatic self-similarity and either self-similar
virialisation or normal steady virialisation. We conclude that distribution
functions that retain a memory of self-similar evolution provide an
understanding of collisionless systems. The implied energy relaxation of the
collisionless matter is due to the time dependence. Phase mixing relaxation may
be enhanced by clump-clump interactions.

through accretion and repeated mergers. Processes that decrease the central
density of CDM halos have been identified, but have not yet reconciled theory
with observations of present day dwarfs. This failure is potentially
catastrophic for the CDM model, possibly requiring a different DM particle
candidate. This Letter presents new hydrodynamical simulations in a Lambda$CDM
framework where analogues of dwarf galaxies, bulgeless and with a shallow
central DM profile, are formed. This is achieved by resolving the inhomogeneous
interstellar medium, resulting in strong outflows from supernovae explosions
which remove low angular momentum gas. This inhibits the formation of bulges
and decreases the dark-matter density to less than half within the central
kiloparsec. Realistic dwarf galaxies are thus shown to be a natural outcome of
galaxy formation in the CDM scenario.

In this paper we continue our study of density cusps that may contain
central black holes. Methods. We recall our attempts to use distribution
functions with a memory of self-similar relaxation, but mostly they apply only
in restricted regions of the global system. We are forced to consider related
distribution functions that are steady but not self-similar. Results. One
remarkably simple distribution function that has a filled loss cone describes a
bulge that transits from a near black hole domain to an outer 'zero flux'
regime where$\rho\propto r^{-7/4}$. The transition passes from an initial
inverse square profile through a region having a 1/r density profile. The
structure is likely to be developed at an early stage in the growth of a
galaxy. A central black hole is shown to grow exponentially in this background
with an e-folding time of a few million years. Conclusions. We derive our
results from first principles, using only the angular momentum integral in
spherical symmetry. The initial relaxation probably requires bar instabilities
and clump-clump interactions.

longitudinal phonon mode to a transverse mode in the same energy range. By
calculating the electron susceptibility from first principles we show that this

understanding black hole accretion and jet production is whether the inner edge
of the accretion disk recedes at low accretion rate. Measurements of the
location of the inner edge (Rin) can be made using iron emission lines that
arise due to fluorescence of iron in the disk, and these indicate that Rin is
very close to the black hole at high and moderate luminosities (near 1% of the
Eddington luminosity, Ledd). Here, we report on X-ray observations of the black
hole GX 339-4 in the hard state by Suzaku and the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer

by a factor of >27 over the value found when GX 339-4 was bright. The exact
value of Rin depends on the inclination of the inner disk (i), and we derive
90% confidence limits of Rin > 35 Rg at i = 0 degrees and Rin > 175 Rg at i =
30 degrees. This provides direct evidence that the inner portion of the disk is
not present at low luminosity, allowing for the possibility that the inner disk
is replaced by advection- or magnetically-dominated accretion flows.

with type II seesaw mechanism for neutrino masses combined with a simple ansatz
that the dominant Yukawa matrix (the {\bf 10}-Higgs coupling to matter) has
rank one. In this paper, we show how the rank one model can arise within some
plausible assumptions as an effective field theory from vectorlike {\bf 16}

the desired fermion flavor texture we use $S_4$ flavon multiplets which acquire
vevs in the ground state of the theory. By supplementing the $S_4$ theory with
an additional discrete symmetry, we find that the flavon vacuum field
alignments take a discrete set of values provided some of the higher
dimensional couplings are small. Choosing a particular set of these vacuum
alignments appears to lead to an unified understanding of observed quark-lepton
flavor:
  (i) the lepton mixing matrix that is dominantly tri-bi-maximal with small
corrections related to quark mixings; (ii) quark lepton mass relations at GUT
scale: $m_b\simeq m_{\tau}$ and $m_\mu\simeq 3 m_s$ and (iii) the solar to
atmospheric neutrino mass ratio $m_\odot/m_{\rm atm}\simeq \theta_{\rm
Cabibbo}$ in agreement with observations. The model predicts the neutrino

studied by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) over a wide doping
range from $x=0.01$ to $x=0.25$. Unlike the well-studied case of the Bi-based
cuprate family, an overall strong, monotonic doping dependence of the SB
intensity at the Fermi level ($E_F$) was observed. In contrast to a previous
report for the presence of the SB only close to $x=1/8$, we found it exists in
a wide doping range, associated with a doping-independent $(\pi,\pi)$ wave
vector but strongly doping-dependent intensity: It is the strongest at $x\sim
0.03$ and systematically diminishes as the doping increases until it becomes
negligible in the overdoped regime. This SB with the observed doping dependence
of intensity can in principle be caused by the antiferromagnetic fluctuations
or a particular form of low-temperature orthorhombic lattice distortion known
to persist up to $x\sim 0.21$ in the system, with both being weakened with
increasing doping. However, a detailed binding energy dependent analysis of the
SB at $x=0.07$ does not appear to support the former interpretation, leaving
the latter as a more plausible candidate, despite a challenge in quantitatively
linking the doping dependences of the SB intensity and the magnitude of the
lattice distortion. Our finding highlights the necessity of a careful and
global consideration of the inherent structural complications for correctly
understanding the cuprate Fermiology and its microscopic implication.

lie on the blue sequence in color vs. stellar mass parameter space, where
spiral galaxies typically reside. While high-mass blue-sequence E/S0s often
resemble young merger or interaction remnants likely to fade to the red
sequence, we focus on blue-sequence E/S0s with lower stellar masses (< a few
10^10 M_sun), which are characterized by fairly regular morphologies and
low-density field environments where fresh gas infall is possible. This
population may provide an evolutionary link between early-type galaxies and
spirals through disk regrowth. Focusing on atomic gas reservoirs, we present
new GBT HI data for 27 E/S0s on both sequences as well as a complete tabulation
of archival HI data for other galaxies in the Nearby Field Galaxy Survey.
Normalized to stellar mass, the atomic gas masses for 12 of the 14
blue-sequence E/S0s range from 0.1 to >1.0. These gas-to-stellar mass ratios
are comparable to those of spiral and irregular galaxies and have a similar
dependence on stellar mass. Assuming that the HI is accessible for star
formation, we find that many of our blue-sequence E/S0s can increase in stellar
mass by 10-60% in 3 Gyr in both of two limiting scenarios, exponentially
declining star formation and constant star formation. In a constant star
formation scenario, about half of the blue-sequence E/S0s require fresh gas
infall on a timescale of <3 Gyr to avoid exhausting their atomic gas reservoirs
and evolving to the red sequence. We present evidence that star formation in
these galaxies is bursty and likely involves externally triggered gas inflows.
Our analysis suggests that most blue-sequence E/S0s are indeed capable of
substantial stellar disk growth on relatively short timescales. (abridged)

accurate spectroscopic redshifts from the zCOSMOS-Bright redshift survey. At
this epoch, early-type galaxies already show a significantly stronger
clustering than late-type galaxies on all probed scales. A comparison to the
SDSS at z~0.1, shows that the relative clustering strength between early and
late morphological classes tends to increase with cosmic time at small
separations, while on large scales it shows no significant evolution since
z~0.8. This suggests that most early-type galaxies had already formed in
intermediate and dense environments at this epoch. Our results are consistent
with a picture in which the relative clustering of different morphological
types between z~1 and z~0, reflects the evolving role of environment in the
morphological transformation of galaxies, on top of the global mass-driven

response of individually separated (6,5) and (7,5) single-walled carbon
nanotubes. Strong photoinduced absorption is observed around 200 meV, whose
transition energy, oscillator strength, resonant chirality enhancement and
dynamics manifest the observation of quasi-1D intra-excitonic transitions. A
model of the nanotube 1s-2p cross section agrees well with the signal
amplitudes. Our study further reveals saturation of the photoinduced absorption
with increasing phase-space filling of the correlated e-h pairs.

a new perspective on some classic entropy-related concepts is presented. This

eigCG algorithm is a memory efficient algorithm that solves the linear system
and simultaneously computes some of its eigenvalues. The algorithm is based on
the Conjugate-Gradient (CG) algorithm, however, it uses only a window of the
vectors generated by the CG algorithm to compute approximate eigenvalues. The
number and accuracy of the eigenvectors can be increased by solving more
right-hand sides. For Hermitian systems with multiple right-hand sides, the
computed eigenvectors can be used to speed up the solution of subsequent
systems. The algorithm was tested on Lattice QCD problems by solving the normal
equations and was shown to give large speed up factors and to remove the
critical slowing down as we approach light quark masses. Here, an extension to
the non-symmetric case based on the two-sided Lanczos algorithm is given. The
new algorithm is tested on Lattice QCD problems and is shown to give promising
results. We also study the removal of the critical slowing down and compare
results with those of the eigCG algorithm. We also discuss the case when the
system is gamma5-Hermitian.

second kind, it is indispensable to assess the accuracy with which these
boundary conditions can be determined so that we can find a reasonable answer,
whether climate is predictable with a sufficient degree of accuracy or not.
Therefore, our contribution is mainly focused on the accuracy with which the
fluxes of sensible heat and water vapor, required for predicting the lower
boundary conditions in numerical models of the atmosphere using the coupled set
of energy and water flux balance equations for the Earth's surface, can be
determined. The parameterization schemes for the interfacial sublayer in the
immediate vicinity of the Earth's surface and for the fully turbulent layer
above presented and discussed here document that an appreciable degree of
uncertainty exists. It is shown that the great uncertainty inherent in the
universal functions of the Monin-Obukhov similarity laws on which the
parameterization schemes for the fully turbulent atmospheric surface layer are
based is reflected by the considerable scatter in the results of sophisticated
field campaigns. This uncertainty affects also the results for the
gradient-Richardson number, the turbulent Prandtl number, Pr_t, and the
turbulent Schmidt number, Sc_{t,q}, (and the turbulent Lewis-Semenov number,
LS_{t,q}) for water vapor used in such parameterization schemes. It is argued
that the inherent uncertainty prevents that climate is predictable with a
sufficient degree of accuracy.

with a massless scalar field. The model obeys two constraints. The first one is
that the gradient of the scalar field is timelike everywhere. The second
constraint is that the radial coordinate basis vector is a unit vector field in
the comoving coordinate system. We find that the resultant dynamical solutions
compose a one-parameter family of self-similar models which is known as the
Roberts solution. The solutions are divided into three classes. The first class
consists of solutions with only one spacelike singularity in the
synchronous-comoving chart. The second class consists of solutions with two
singularities which are null and spacelike, respectively. The third class
consists of solutions with two spacelike singularities which correspond to the
big bang and big crunch, respectively. We see that, in the first case, a
comoving volume exponentially expands as in an inflationary period; the fluid
elements are accelerated outwards form the symmetry center, even though the
strong energy condition is satisfied. This behavior is very different from that
observed in the homogeneous and isotropic universe in which the fluid elements
would move outwards with deceleration, if the strong energy conditions are
satisfied. We are thus able to achieve the accelerated expansion of the
universe for the models considered here, without a need to violate the energy
conditions. The cosmological features of the models are examined in some

pileup (significant within ~ 3' of the image center) and telemetry saturation
of the XIS data were carefully considered. The source was detected up to ~ 300$
keV, with an unabsorbed 0.5--200 keV luminosity of ~3.8 10^{38} erg/s at 8 kpc.
The spectrum can be approximated by a power-law of photon index 2.7, with a
mild soft excess and a hard X-ray hump. When using the XIS data outside 2' of
the image center, the Fe-K line appeared extremely broad, suggesting a high
black hole spin as already reported by Miller et al. (2008) based on the Suzaku
data and other CCD data. When the XIS data accumulation is further limited to
>3' to avoid event pileup, the Fe-K profile becomes narrower, and there appears
a marginally better solution that suggests the inner disk radius to be 5-14
times the gravitational radius (1-sigma), though a maximally spinning black
hole is still allowed by the data at the 90% confidence level. Consistently,
the optically-thick accretion disk is inferred to be truncated at a radius 5-32
times the gravitational radius. Thus, the Suzaku data allow an alternative
explanation without invoking a rapidly spinning black hole. This inference is
further supported by the disk radius measured previously in the High/Soft
state.

we show that such community structure can be directly identified through the

indicate that the conductance optimization method significantly outperforms the
modularity optimization methods at identifying the community structure of

insights into the multiple topological scales of complex networks, and the
obtained community structure can naturally reflect the diffusion capability of

the effect of n-type doping on the optical absorption and the refractive index
in wurtzite InN and GaN. We identify quite different dielectric response in
either case; while InN shows a significant shift in the absorption edge due to
n-type doping, this is masked for GaN due to efficient cancellation of the
Burstein-Moss effect by the band gap renormalization. For high doping levels
the intraband absorption becomes significant in InN. Furthermore, we observe
that the free-carrier plasma contribution to refractive index change becomes
more important than both band filling and the band gap renormalization for
electron densities above 10$^{19}$~cm$^{-3}$ in GaN, and 10$^{20}$~cm$^{-3}$ in
InN. As a result of the two different characteristics mentioned above, the
overall change in the refractive index due to n-type doping is much higher in
InN compared to GaN, which in the former exceeds 4\% for a doping of
10$^{19}$~cm$^{-3}$ at 1.55~$\mu$m wavelength. Finally, we consider intrinsic
InN under strong photoexcitation which introduces equal density of electron and
holes thermalized to their respective band edges. The change in the refractive
index at 1.55~$\mu$m is observed to be similar to the n-doped case up to a
carrier density of 10$^{20}$~cm$^{-3}$. However, in the photoexcited case this
is now accompanied by a strong absorption in this wavelength region due to
$\Gamma^v_5 \to \Gamma^v_6$ intravalence band transition. Our findings suggest
that the alloy composition of In$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N can be optimized in the
indium-rich region so as to benefit from high carrier-induced refractive index
change while operating in the transparency region to minimize the losses. These
can have direct implications for InN-containing optical phase modulators and

Magnetohydrodynamic turbulence makes both problems highly nonlinear, so both
subjects have benefitted from numerical simulations.However, understanding the
key principles and practical modeling of observations warrants testable
semi-analytic mean field theories that distill the essential physics. Mean
field dynamo (MFD) theory and alpha-viscosity accretion disc theory exemplify
this pursuit. That the latter is a mean field theory is not always made
explicit but the combination of turbulence and global symmetry imply such. The
more commonly explicit presentation of assumptions in 20th century textbook
MFDT has exposed it to arguably more widespread criticism than incurred by 20th
century alpha-accretion theory despite complementary weaknesses. In the 21st
century however, MFDT has experienced a breakthrough with a dynamical
saturation theory that consistently agrees with simulations. Such has not yet
occurred in accretion disc theory, though progress is emerging. Ironically
however, for accretion engines, MFDT and accretion theory are presently two
artificially uncoupled pieces of what should be a single coupled theory. Large
scale fields and accretion flows are dynamically intertwined because large
scale fields likely play a key role in angular momentum transport. I discuss
and synthesize aspects of recent progress in MFDT and accretion disc theory to
suggest why the two likely conspire in a unified theory.

agreement with previous work, we find baryon condensation to lead to increased
dark matter concentration. Dark matter density profiles differ substantially in
shape from halo to halo when baryons are included, but in all cases the
velocity dispersion decreases monotonically with radius. Some haloes show an
approximately constant dark matter velocity anisotropy with $ \beta \approx
0.1-02$, while others retain the anisotropy structure of their baryon-free
versions. Most of our haloes become approximately oblate in their inner
regions, although a few retain the shape of their dissipationless counterparts.
Pseudo-phase-space densities are described by a power law in radius of altered
slope when baryons are included. The shape and concentration of the dark matter
density profiles are not well reproduced by published adiabatic contraction
models. The significant spread we find in the density and kinematic structure
of our haloes appears related to differences in their formation histories. Such
differences already affect the final structure in baryon-free simulations, but
they are reinforced by the inclusion of baryons, and new features are produced.
The details of galaxy formation need to be better understood before the inner
dark matter structure of galaxies can be used to constrain cosmological models
or the nature of dark matter.

problem for complete systems, which are special finite circular splicing
systems. We show that a circular language L is generated by a complete system
if and only if the set Lin(L) of all words corresponding to L is a pure unitary
language generated by a set closed under the conjugacy relation. The class of
pure unitary languages was introduced by A. Ehrenfeucht, D. Haussler, G.
Rozenberg in 1983, as a subclass of the class of context-free languages,
together with a characterization of regular pure unitary languages by means of
a decidable property. As a direct consequence, we characterize (regular)
circular languages generated by complete systems. We can also decide whether
the language generated by a complete system is regular. Finally, we point out
that complete systems have the same computational power as finite simple
systems, an easy type of circular splicing system defined in the literature

complete systems, it follows that finite simple systems generate a class of

be used to model computation over the real numbers. In this context the
computational complexity of real functions defined over compact domains has
been extensively studied. However, much less have been done for other kinds of
real functions. This article is divided into two main parts. The first part
investigates polynomial time computability of rational functions and the role
of continuity in such computation. On the one hand this is interesting for its
own sake. On the other hand it provides insights into polynomial time
computability of real functions for the latter, in the sense of recursive
analysis, is modeled as approximations of rational computations. The main
conclusion of this part is that continuity does not play any role in the
efficiency of computing rational functions. The second part defines polynomial
time computability of arbitrary real functions, characterizes it, and compares
it with the corresponding notion over rational functions. Assuming continuity,
the main conclusion is that there is a conceptual difference between polynomial
time computation over the rationals and the reals manifested by the fact that

been used in the last five years to study the cosmic chemical evolution, from
the local universe to the first stars. The sample size is still relatively
small when compared to field galaxy surveys. However, GRBs show a universe that
is surprising. At z > 2, the cold interstellar medium in galaxies is chemically
evolved, with a mean metallicity of about 1/10 solar. At lower redshift (z <
1), metallicities of the ionized gas are relatively low, on average 1/6 solar.
Not only is there no evidence of redshift evolution in the interval 0 < z <
6.3, but also the dispersion in the ~ 30 objects is large. This suggests that
the metallicity of host galaxies is not the physical quantity triggering GRB
events. From the investigation of other galaxy parameters, it emerges that
active star-formation might be a stronger requirement to produce a GRB. Several
recent striking results strongly support the idea that GRB studies open a new
view on our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution, back to the very
primordial universe at z ~ 8.

This stellar component is likely confined to the collisional interface of a

ambient gas, ~600 pc away from the central starburst nucleus. The spectroscopic
properties of the latter imply a large extinction (C_H-beta>0.9), and the
presence of an additional non-thermal ionization source, most likely a
low-luminosity Active Galactic Nucleus. Mrk 409 shows a relatively large oxygen

a set of $2^K-1$ information sources, ordered in a decreasing level of
importance, is encoded into $K$ messages (or descriptions). There are $2^K-1$
decoders, each of which has access to a non-empty subset of the encoded
messages. Each decoder is required to reproduce the information sources up to a
certain importance level depending on the combination of descriptions available
to it. We obtain a single letter characterization of the achievable rate region
for the 3-description problem. In contrast to symmetric multilevel diversity
coding, source-separation coding is not sufficient in the asymmetric case, and
ideas akin to network coding need to be used strategically. Based on the
intuitions gained in treating the A-MLD problem, we derive inner and outer
bounds for the rate region of the asymmetric Gaussian multiple description (MD)
problem with three descriptions. Both the inner and outer bounds have a similar
geometric structure to the rate region template of the A-MLD coding problem,

approximate characterization of the asymmetric Gaussian three description rate

the damping caused by the dissipation can dominate the friction of the inflaton

lead to unstable orbits for the inner planets on much shorter time scales.
Therefore we did numerical experiments in different dynamical models with
different initial conditions -- on one hand the couple Venus-Earth was set
close to different mean motion resonances (MMR), and on the other hand Venus'
orbital eccentricity (or inclination) was set to values as large as e = 0.36 (i

percent). Especially Mercury is strongly affected by relatively small changes
in eccentricity and/or inclination of Venus in these resonances. Even escapes
for the innermost planet are possible which may happen quite rapidly.

hadronic matter we find that elliptic flow observables strongly dependent on
dissipative effects in the late stage. On the other hand, interferometry radii
are sensitive, through the early transverse flow, on the value of the viscosity
at high temperatures. We present first calculations including the effects of
bulk viscosity in the hadronic phase and in the hadron emission. We find them
important in obtaining a small freeze-out temperature consistent with the
measured transverse momentum spectra and elliptic flow of identified particles.

conjunction with recent results on high fidelity quantum gates using CDD, our

continuum and bound states contributions to the dc current. A general formalism
to obtain the Andreev bound states (ABS) of a normal chain connected to
superconducting leads is also presented. We identify a regime in which all
Josephson current is carried by the ABS and obtain an analytic formula for the
current-phase relation in the limit of long chains. In the latter case the
condition for perfect Andreev reflections is expressed in terms of the
microscopic parameters of the model, showing a limitation of the so called
wide-band-limit (WBL) approximation. When a finite bias is applied to the S-N-S
junction we compute the exact time-evolution of the system by solving
numerically the time-dependent Bogoliubov-deGennes equations. We provide a
microscopic description of the electron dynamics not only inside the normal
region but also in the superconductors, thus gaining more information with

learning with scale-free memory is developed. The agents are assumed to act
independently of one another in optimizing their choice of possible actions via
trial-and-error search. To gain awareness about the action value the agents
accumulate in their memory the rewards obtained from taking a specific action
at each moment of time. The contribution of the rewards in the past to the
agent current perception of action value is described by an integral operator
with a power-law kernel. Finally a fractional differential equation governing
the system dynamics is obtained. The agents are considered to interact with one
another implicitly via the reward of one agent depending on the choice of the
other agents. The pairwise interaction model is adopted to describe this
effect. As a specific example of systems with non-transitive interactions, a
two agent and three agent systems of the rock-paper-scissors type are analyzed
in detail, including the stability analysis and numerical simulation.
Scale-free memory is demonstrated to cause complex dynamics of the systems at
hand. In particular, it is shown that there can be simultaneously two modes of
the system instability undergoing subcritical and supercritical bifurcation,
with the latter one exhibiting anomalous oscillations with the amplitude and
period growing with time. Besides, the instability onset via this supercritical
mode may be regarded as ""altruism self-organization"". For the three agent
system the instability dynamics is found to be rather irregular and can be
composed of alternate fragments of oscillations different in their properties.

will be violated. As a consequence, no physical process can actually happen

smallest unit. More intriguingly, systems with a larger size and a slower speed
will have a larger unit of time. Unlike many other interpretations of the
