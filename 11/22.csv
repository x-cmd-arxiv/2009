$\{\xi(t),t\geq0\}$. Motivated by the results obtained previously in the
context of the random energy model, we prove functional limit theorems for the
process \[Z_N(t)=\sum_{i=1}^N\mathrm{e}^{\xi_i(s_N+t)}\] as $N\to\infty$, where
$s_N$ is a non-negative sequence converging to $+\infty$. The limiting process
depends heavily on the growth rate of the sequence $s_N$. If $s_N$ grows slowly
in the sense that $\liminf_{N\to\infty}\log N/s_N>\lambda_2$ for some critical
value $\lambda_2>0$, then the limit is an Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process. However,
if $\lambda:=\lim_{N\to\infty}\log N/s_N\in(0,\lambda_2)$, then the limit is a
certain completely asymmetric $\alpha$-stable process $\mathbb {Y}_{\alpha

060218, with luminosities much lower than those of other classic bursts, lead
to the definition of a new class of GRBs -- low-luminosity GRBs. The nature of
the outflow responsible for them is not clear yet. Two scenarios have been
suggested: one is the conventional relativistic outflow with initial Lorentz
factor of order of $\Gamma_0\ga 10$ and the other is a trans-relativistic
outflow with $\Gamma_0\simeq 1-2$. Here we compare the high energy gamma-ray
afterglow emission from these two different models, taking into account both
synchrotron self inverse-Compton scattering (SSC) and the external
inverse-Compton scattering due to photons from the cooling supernova or
hypernova envelope (SNIC). We find that the conventional relativistic outflow
model predicts a relatively high gamma-ray flux from SSC at early times ($<10^4
{\rm s}$ for typical parameters) with a rapidly decaying light curve, while in
the trans-relativistic outflow model, one would expect a much flatter light
curve of high-energy gamma-ray emission at early times, which could be
dominated by both the SSC emission and SNIC emission, depending on the
properties of the underlying supernova and the shock parameter $\epsilon_e$ and
$\epsilon_B$. The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope should be able to distinguish
between the two models in the future.

absorbed blackbody model can describe the observed spectra, yielding a
temperature of 57 eV, neutral hydrogen column density of 2x10^{21} cm^{-2}, and
a bolometric luminosity of ~10^{36} erg s^{-1}. However, at the same time, we

resolution and low signal-to-noise ratio below 0.6 keV, the statistical
parameter uncertainties are large, but the ambiguity of the two very different
models demonstrates that the systematic errors are the main point of concern.

Together with the \emph{redundancy property} of sensor networks, which means
that an event can be simultaneously observed by multiple sensor nodes, the
devised CFA scheme is used to construct a CFA-based en-route filtering (CFAEF)
scheme. In contrast to most of the existing methods, which rely on complicated
security associations among sensor nodes, our design, which directly exploits
an en-route filtering hash function, appears to be novel. We examine the CFA
and CFAEF schemes from both the theoretical and numerical aspects to
demonstrate their efficiency and effectiveness.

tripartite-state, where the subsystem of the bipartite-state is identical. We
study the relation between spin squeezing parameters and entanglement through
the quantum entropy of a system starts initially in a pure state when the
cavity is binomial. We show that spin squeezing can be a convenient tool to
give some insight into the subsystems entanglement dynamics when the bipartite
subsystem interacts simultaneously with the cavity field subsystem, specially
when the interaction occurs off-resonantly without and with a nonlinear medium
contained in the cavity field subsystem. We illustrate that, in case of large
off-resonance interaction, spin squeezing clarifies the properties of
entanglement almost with full success. However, it is not a general rule when
the cavity is assumed to be filled with a non-linear medium. In this case, we
illustrate that the insight into entanglement dynamics becomes more clearly in
case of a weak nonlinear medium than in strong nonlinear medium. In parallel,
the role of the phase space distribution in quantifying entanglement is also
studied. The numerical results of Husimi $Q$-function show that the integer
strength of the nonlinear medium produces Schr\""{o}dinger cat states which is
necessary for quantum entanglement.

Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT). The target galaxies are selected using
ultraviolet photometry from the GALEX satellite, with a flux limit of NUV<22.8

primary aim of the survey is to precisely measure the scale of baryon acoustic
oscillations (BAO) imprinted on the spatial distribution of these galaxies at
look-back times of 4-8 Gyrs. Detailed forecasts indicate the survey will
measure the BAO scale to better than 2% and the tangential and radial acoustic

  This paper provides a detailed description of the survey and its design, as
well as the spectroscopic observations, data reduction, and redshift
measurement techniques employed. It also presents an analysis of the properties
of the target galaxies, including emission line diagnostics which show that
they are mostly extreme starburst galaxies, and Hubble Space Telescope images,
which show they contain a high fraction of interacting or distorted systems. In
conjunction with this paper, we make a public data release of data for the

can be applied for deriving stellar ages. The achievable precision depends on
factors related to spectroscopy, nucleosynthesis, and chemical evolution. We
quantify the uncertainties arising from the spectroscopic analysis, and compare
these to the other error sources. We derive formulae for the age uncertainties
arising from the spectroscopic abundance analysis, and apply them to
spectroscopic and nucleosynthetic data compiled from the literature for the Sun
and metal-poor stars. We obtained ready-to-use analytic formulae of the age
uncertainty for the cases of stable+unstable and unstable+unstable chronometer
pairs, and discuss the optimal relation between to-be-measured age and mean
lifetime of a radioactive species. Application to the literature data indicates
that, for a single star, the achievable spectroscopic accuracy is limited to
about +/- 20% for the foreseeable future. At present, theoretical uncertainties
in nucleosynthesis and chemical evolution models form the precision bottleneck.
For stellar clusters, isochrone fitting provides a higher accuracy than
radioactive dating, but radioactive dating becomes competitive when applied to
many cluster members simultaneously, reducing the statistical errors by a
factor sqrt(N). Spectroscopy-based radioactive stellar dating would benefit
from improvements in the theoretical understanding of nucleosynthesis and
chemical evolution. Its application to clusters can provide strong constraints
for nucleosynthetic models.

2009 (MJD 54682.7-54884.2). This is the first detailed study of PG 1553+113 in
the GeV gamma-ray regime and it allows us to fill a gap of three decades in
energy in its spectral energy distribution. We find PG 1553+113 to be a steady
source with a hard spectrum that is best fit by a simple power-law in the Fermi
energy band. We combine the Fermi data with archival radio, optical, X-ray and
very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray data to model its broadband spectral energy
distribution and find that a simple, one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model
provides a reasonable fit. PG 1553+113 has the softest VHE spectrum of all
sources detected in that regime and, out of those with significant detections
across the Fermi energy bandpass so far, the hardest spectrum in that energy
regime. Thus, it has the largest spectral break of any gamma-ray source studied
to date, which could be due to the absorption of the intrinsic gamma-ray
spectrum by the extragalactic background light (EBL). Assuming this to be the
case, we selected a model with a low level of EBL and used it to absorb the
power-law spectrum from PG 1553+113 measured with Fermi (200 MeV - 157 GeV) to
find the redshift which gave the best fit to the measured VHE data (90 GeV -
1.1 TeV) for this parameterisation of the EBL. We show that this redshift can
be considered an upper limit on the distance to PG 1553+113.
