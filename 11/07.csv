of massive ellipticals, bulge-dominated disks, intermediate-bulge disks,
bulge-less disks and irregular galaxies evolves from z=0.2 to z=1. The
morphological evolution depends strongly on mass. At M>3e11 Msol, no evolution
is detected in the morphological mix: ellipticals dominate since z=1, and the
Hubble sequence has quantitatively settled down by this epoch. At the 1e11 Msol
mass scale, little evolution is detected, which can be entirely explained with
major mergers. Most of the morphological evolution from z=1 to z=0.2 takes
place at masses 5e10 - 1e11 Msol, where: (i) The fraction of spirals
substantially drops and the contribution of early-types increases. This
increase is mostly produced by the growth of bulge-dominated disks, which vary
their contribution from ~10% at z=1 to >30% at z=0.2 (cf. the elliptical
fraction grows from ~15% to ~20%). Thus, at these masses, transformations from
late- to early-types result in disk-less elliptical morphologies with a
statistical frequency of only 30% - 40%. Otherwise, the processes which are
responsible for the transformations either retain or produce a non-negligible
disk component. (ii) The bulge-less disk galaxies, which contribute ~15% to the
intermediate-mass galaxy population at z=1, virtually disappear by z=0.2. The
merger rate since z=1 is too low to account for the disappearance of these
massive bulge-less disks, which most likely grow a bulge via secular evolution.

friction from ambient gas. Consequently, their orbits decay, with both the
separation and period decreasing in time. A simple analytic expression is
derived for this braking torque. The derivation utilizes the fact that each
binary acts as a quadrupolar source of acoustic waves. The acoustic disturbance
has the morphology of a two-armed spiral and carries off angular momentum. From
the expression for the braking torque, the binary orbital evolution is also
determined analytically. This type of merger may help explain the origin of
high-mass stars. If infrared dark clouds, with peak densities up to 10^7
cm^{-3}, contain low-mass binaries, those with separations less than 100 AU
merge within about 10^5 yr. During the last few thousand years of the process,
the rate of mechanical energy deposition in the gas exceeds the stars'
radiative luminosity. Successive mergers may lead to the massive star formation
believed to occur in these clouds.

employ the Pitaevski-Landau identities, which express the derivatives of the

non-linear equations for $Z_\Gamma$, $Z$, and $m^*/m$. We show that near the

the Falicov-Kimball model with nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory. The
excitation energy vanishes algebraically for long ramp times with an exponent
that depends on whether the ramp takes place within the metallic phase, within
the insulating phase, or across the Mott transition line. For ramps within
metallic or insulating phase the exponents are in agreement with a perturbative
analysis for small ramps. The perturbative expression quite generally shows
that the exponent depends explicitly on the spectrum of the system in the
initial state and on the smoothness of the ramp protocol. This explains the
qualitatively different behavior of gapless (e.g., metallic) and gapped (e.g.,
Mott insulating) systems. For gapped systems the asymptotic behavior of the
excitation energy depends only on the ramp protocol and its decay becomes
faster for smoother ramps. For gapless systems and sufficiently smooth ramps
the asymptotics are ramp-independent and depend only on the intrinsic spectrum
of the system. However, the intrinsic behavior is unobservable if the ramp is
not smooth enough. This is relevant for ramps to small interaction in the
fermionic Hubbard model, where the intrinsic cubic fall-off of the excitation
energy cannot be observed for a linear ramp due to its kinks at the beginning
and the end.

so may host Population (Pop) III star formation. We estimate an upper limit for
the abundance of Pop III star clusters which thus form in the reionized

there may be a sufficient number density of Pop III star clusters for detection
in surveys such as the Deep-Wide Survey (DWS) to be conducted by the James Webb

reionization are most likely to be found at z >~ 3 and within ~ 40 arcsec (~ 1
Mpc comoving) of DM haloes with masses of ~ 10^11 M_Sun, the descendants of the

fraction of DM haloes with masses as high as ~10^9 M_Sun at redshifts z <~ 4
are not enriched due to star formation in their progenitors, external metal
enrichment due to galactic winds is likely to preclude Pop III star formation
in a large fraction of otherwise unenriched haloes, perhaps even preventing
star formation in pristine haloes altogether after reionization is complete.

requires exquisite control of low-order wavefront aberrations, such as tip-tilt
(pointing) and focus. We propose an accurate, efficient and easy to implement
technique to measure such aberrations in coronagraphs which use a focal plane
mask to block starlight. The Coronagraphic Low Order Wavefront Sensor (CLOWFS)
produces a defocused image of a reflective focal plane ring to measure low
order aberrations. Even for small levels of wavefront aberration, the proposed
scheme produces large intensity signals which can be easily measured, and
therefore does not require highly accurate calibration of either the detector
or optical elements. The CLOWFS achieves nearly optimal sensitivity and is
immune from non-common path errors. This technique is especially well suited
for high performance low inner working angle (IWA) coronagraphs. On
phase-induced amplitude apodization (PIAA) type coronagraphs, it can
unambiguously recover aberrations which originate from either side of the beam
shaping introduced by the PIAA optics. We show that the proposed CLOWFS can
measure sub-milliarcsecond telescope pointing errors several orders of
magnitude faster than would be possible in the coronagraphic science focal
plane alone, and can also accurately calibrate residual coronagraphic leaks due
to residual low order aberrations. We have demonstrated 1e-3 lambda/D pointing
stability in a laboratory demonstration of the CLOWFS on a PIAA type
coronagraph.

(nlCWFS) approaches the theoretical sensitivity limit imposed by fundamental
physics by taking full advantage of wavefront spatial coherence in the pupil

aberrations with the sensitivity set by the telescope's diffraction limit
lambda/D rather than the seeing limit of more conventional linear WFSs.
Closed-loop adaptive optics simulations show that with a nlCWFS, a 100 nm RMS
wavefront error can be reached on a 8-m telescope on a mV = 13 natural guide
star. The nlCWFS technique is best suited for high precision adaptive optics on
bright natural guide stars. It is therefore an attractive technique to consider
for direct imaging of exoplanets and disks around nearby stars, where achieved
performance is set by wavefront control accuracy, and exquisite control of low
order aberrations is essential for high contrast coronagraphic imaging.
Performance gains derived from simulations are shown, and approaches for high

correlation between valence electrons and the outermost core electrons.
Correlation within the core is often neglected. A large orbital basis is needed
to saturate both the valence and core-valence correlation effects. This in turn
leads to huge numbers of CSFs, many of which are unimportant. To avoid the
problems inherent to the use of a single common orthonormal orbital basis for
all correlation effects in the MCHF method, we propose to optimize independent
MCHF pair-correlation functions (PCFs), bringing their own orthonormal
one-electron basis. Each PCF is generated by allowing single- and double-
excitations from a multireference (MR) function. This computational scheme has
the advantage of using targeted and optimally localized orbital sets for each
PCF. These pair-correlation functions are coupled together and with each
component of the MR space through a low dimension generalized eigenvalue
problem. Nonorthogonal orbital sets being involved, the interaction and overlap
matrices are built using biorthonormal transformation of the coupled basis sets
followed by a counter-transformation of the PCF expansions.
  Applied to the ground state of beryllium, the new method gives total energies
that are lower than the ones from traditional CAS-MCHF calculations using large
orbital active sets. It is fair to say that we now have the possibility to
account for, in a balanced way, correlation deep down in the atomic core in

In this paper, we normalize publication metrics across both time and discipline
in order to achieve a universal framework for analyzing and comparing
scientific achievement. We study the publication careers of individual authors
over the 50-year period 1958-2008 within six high-impact journals: CELL, the
New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), Nature, the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Science (PNAS), Physical Review Letters (PRL), and Science. In
comparing the achievement of authors within each journal, we uncover
quantifiable statistical regularity in the probability density function (pdf)
of scientific achievement across both time and discipline. The universal
distribution of career success within these arenas for publication raises the
possibility that a fundamental driving force underlying scientific achievement
is the competitive nature of scientific advancement.

van Leeuwens (2007) re-reduction of the Hipparcos parallaxes. The typical error

uncertain or unmeasurable, so typical errors in their log g values are 0.2-0.3
dex.
  A new Teff scale for A5-G5 stars of luminosity classes Ib-II is presented.
Spectral subtypes and luminosity classes of several stars are corrected.
Combining the Teff and log g with evolutionary tracks, stellar masses and ages

  Using Fe ii lines, which are insensitive to departures from LTE, the
microturbulent parameter Vt and the iron abundance log e(Fe) are determined
from high-resolution spectra. The parameter Vt is correlated with gravity: Vt
increases with decreasing log g. The mean iron abundance for the 48 supergiants
with distances d < 700 pc is log e(Fe)=7.48+-0.09, a value close to the solar
value of 7.45+-0.05, and thus the local supergiants and the Sun have the same

Kozai oscillations.
  We numerically investigate the fate of an initially coplanar double-planet
system in a class of binaries with separation ranging between $12 - 20 $ AU.
Dynamical integrations of representative four-body systems are performed, each
including a hot Jupiter and a second planet on a wider orbit. We find that,
although such systems can remain stable at low relative inclinations ($\lesssim
40^\circ$), high relative inclinations are likely to lead to instabilities.
This can be avoided if the planets are placed in a \emph{Kozai-stable zone}
within which mutual gravitational perturbations can suppress the Kozai
mechanism.
  We investigate the possibility of inducing Kozai oscillations in the inner
orbit by a weak coupling mechanism between the planets in which the coplanarity
is broken due to a differential nodal precession. Propagating perturbations
from the stellar companion through a planetary system in this manner can have
dramatic effects on the dynamical evolution of planetary systems, especially in
tight binaries and can offer a reasonable explanation for eccentricity trends
among planets observed in binary systems. We find that inducing such
oscillations into the orbit of a hot Jupiter is more likely in tight binaries
and an upper limit can be set on the binary separation above which these
oscillations are not observed.

optimization which satisfy the natural properties of decreasing marginal costs.
The study of these functions has led to strong structural properties with
applications in many areas. Recently, there has been significant interest in
extending the theory of algorithms for optimizing combinatorial problems (such
as network design problem of spanning tree) over submodular functions.
Unfortunately, the lower bounds under the general class of submodular functions
are known to be very high for many of the classical problems.
  In this paper, we introduce and study an important subclass of submodular
functions, which we call discounted price functions. These functions are
succinctly representable and generalize linear cost functions. In this paper we
study the following fundamental combinatorial optimization problems: Edge
Cover, Spanning Tree, Perfect Matching and Shortest Path, and obtain tight
upper and lower bounds for these problems.
  The main technical contribution of this paper is designing novel adaptive

LRG samples were extracted from imaging data of the SDSS based on two previous
spectroscopic redshift surveys, the SDSS-LRG and the 2SLAQ surveys at average
redshifts z~0.35 and z~0.55. In addition we have added a higher-redshift
photometric LRG sample based on the selection of the AAOmega LRG redshift
survey at z~0.7. The total LRG sample thus comprises 1.5 million galaxies,
sampling a redshift range of 0.2 < z < 0.9 over ~7600 square degrees of the
sky, probing a total cosmic volume of ~5.5 h^{-3} Gpc^3. We find that the new
LRG sample at z~0.7 shows very little positive evidence for the ISW effect.
Indeed, the cross-correlation is negative out to ~1 deg. The standard LCDM
model is rejected at ~2-3% significance by the new LRG data. We then performed
a new test on the robustness of the LRG ISW detections at z~0.35 and 0.55. We
made 8 rotations through 360deg of the CMB maps with respect to the LRG samples
around the galactic pole. We find that in both cases there are stronger effects
at angles other than zero. This implies that the z~0.35 and 0.55 ISW detections
may still be subject to systematic errors which combined with the known
sizeable statistical errors may leave these ISW detections looking unreliable.
We have further made the rotation test on several other samples where ISW
detections have been claimed and find that they also show peaks when rotated.
We conclude that in the samples we have tested the ISW effect may be absent and
we argue that this result may not be in contradiction with previous results.

CMB anisotropies at angular scales as small as l~2500, necessitating a
calculation of recombination with fractional accuracy of ~10^{-3}. Recent work
on recombination includes two-photon transitions from high excitation states
and many radiative transfer effects. Modern recombination calculations
separately follow angular momentum sublevels of the hydrogen atom to accurately
treat non-equilibrium effects at late times (z<900). The inclusion of extremely
high-n (n>100) states of hydrogen is then computationally challenging,
preventing until now a determination of the maximum n needed to predict CMB
anisotropy spectra with sufficient accuracy for Planck. Here, results from a
new multi-level-atom code (RecSparse) are presented. For the first time,
`forbidden' quadrupole transitions of hydrogen are included, but shown to be
negligible. RecSparse is designed to quickly calculate recombination histories
including extremely high-n states in hydrogen. Histories for a sequence of
values as high as n_max=250 are computed, keeping track of all angular momentum
sublevels and energy shells of the hydrogen atom separately. Use of an
insufficiently high n_max value (e.g., n_max=64) leads to errors (e.g., 1.8
sigma for Planck) in the predicted CMB power spectrum. Extrapolating errors,
the resulting CMB anisotropy spectra are converged to 0.5 sigma at

stability or facilitate the exchange of angular momentum. The binding energies

around a line in the log(Re), SBe, log(sigma) parameter space, with a moderate
degree of scatter and remarkable axi-symmetry. This implies the existence of a
purely photometric scaling law obtained by projecting such a line onto the
log(Re), SBe plane. Such photometric quantities are readily available for large
samples of clusters, as opposed to stellar velocity dispersion data. We study a
sample of 129 Galactic and extragalactic clusters on such photometric plane in
the V-band. We look for a linear relation between SBe and log(Re) and study how
the scatter around it is influenced by age and dynamical environment. We
interpret our results as a test on the evolutionary versus primordial origin of
the Fundamental Line. We perform a detailed analysis of surface brightness
profiles, which allows us to present a catalogue of structural properties,
without relying on a given dynamical model. We find a linear relation between
SBe and log(Re), in the form SBe = (5.25 +- 0.44) log(Re) + (15.58 +- 0.28),
where SBe is measured in mag/arcsec^2 and Re in parsec. Both young and old
clusters lie on the scaling law, with a scatter of approximately 1 mag in SBe.
However, young clusters display more scatter and a clear trend of such scatter
with age, which old clusters do not. Such trend becomes tighter if cluster age
is measured in units of the cluster half-light relaxation time. Two-body
relaxation therefore plays a major role, together with passive stellar
population evolution, in shaping the relation between SBe, log(Re), and cluster
age. We argue that the log(Re)-SBe relation and hence the Fundamental Line
scaling law is not primordially set at cluster formation, but rather is the
result of combined stellar evolution and collisional dynamical evolution.

photometry from the Suprime-Cam instrument on Subaru, we have calculated global
properties for the dwarfs, such as systemic velocities, metallicites and
half-light radii.We find each dwarf to be very metal poor ([Fe/H] -2 both
photometrically and spectroscopically, from their stacked spectrum), and as
such, they continue to follow the luminosity-metallicity relationship
established with brighter dwarfs. We are unable to resolve a dispersion for And
XI due to small sample size and low S/N, but we set a one sigma upper limit of
sigma-v <5 km/s. For And IX, And XII and And XIII we resolve velocity
dispersions of v=4.5 (+3.4,-3.2), 2.6(+5.1,-2.6) and 9.7(+8.9,-4.5) km/s, and

giant planets: capture of one member of a ~100-km binary asteroid after tidal
disruption. The energy loss from disruption is sufficient for capture, but it
cannot deliver the bodies directly to the observed orbits of the irregular
satellites. Instead, the long-lived capture orbits subsequently evolve inward
due to interactions with a tenuous circumplanetary gas disk.
  We focus on the capture by Jupiter, which, due to its large mass, provides
the most stringent test of our model. We investigate the possible fates of
disrupted bodies, the differences between prograde and retrograde captures, and
the effects of Callisto on captured objects. We make an impulse approximation
and discuss how it allows us to generalize capture results from equal-mass
binaries to binaries with arbitrary mass ratios.
  We find that at Jupiter, binaries offer an increase of a factor of ~10 in the
capture rate of 100-km objects as compared to single bodies, for objects
separated by tens of radii that approach the planet on relatively low-energy
trajectories. These bodies are at risk of collision with Callisto, but may be
preserved by gas drag if their pericenters are raised quickly enough. We
conclude that our mechanism is as capable of producing large irregular
satellites as previous suggestions, and it avoids several problems faced by
alternative models.

dynamical spectrum of granular compaction by measuring a complex
(frequency-dependent) volumetric susceptibility $\tilde{\chi}_v$. While the
packing density $\rho$ displays glass-like slow relaxations (aging) and
history-dependence (memory) at low tapping amplitudes, the susceptibility
$\tilde{\chi}_v$ displays very weak aging effects, and its spectrum shows no
sign of a rapidly growing timescale. These features place $\tilde{\chi}_v$ in
sharp contrast to its dielectric and magnetic counterparts in structural and
spin glasses; instead, $\tilde\chi_v$ bears close similarities to the complex
specific heat of spin glasses. This, I suggest, indicates the glass-like
dynamics in granular compaction are governed by statistically rare relaxation
processes that become increasingly separated in timescale from the typical
relaxations of the system. Finally, I examine the effect of finite system size
on the spectrum of compaction dynamics. Starting from the ansatz that low
frequency processes correspond to large scale particle rearrangements, I
suggest the observed finite size effects are consistent with the suppression of
large-scale collective rearrangements in small systems.

whereas in the latter mechanism proton is produced when the diquark, which is
formed right after the visrtual photon-quark interaction, captures a quark from
the vacuum. Unlike previous papers on the subject, particular attention is paid
on the effects of the final state interaction of the hadronizing quark with the
nuclear medium within an approach based upon an effective time-dependent cross
section which combines the soft and hard parts of hadronization dynamics in
terms of the string model and perturbative QCD, respectively. It is shown that
the final state interaction of the hadronizing quark with the medium plays a
relevant role both in deuteron and complex nuclei; nonetheless, kinematical
regions where final state interaction effects are minimized can experimentally
be selected, which would allow one to investigate the structure functions of
nucleons embedded in the nuclear medium; likewise, regions where the
interaction of the struck hadronizing quark with the nuclear medium is
maximized can be found, which would make it possible to study non perturbative
hadronization mechanisms.

differential equations of two variables: the Taylor deformation parameter and
inclination angle $\theta$. In a steady shear flow with a low viscosity
$\eta_{\rm {in}}$ of internal fluid, the vesicles exhibit steady tank-treading
motion with a constant inclination angle $\theta_0$. In the oscillatory flow
with a low shear frequency, $\theta$ oscillates between $\pm \theta_0$ or
around $\theta_0$ for zero or finite mean shear rate $\dot\gamma_{\rm m}$,
respectively. As shear frequency $f_{\gamma}$ increases, the vesicle
oscillation becomes delayed with respect to the shear oscillation, and the
oscillation amplitude decreases. At high $f_{\gamma}$ with $\dot\gamma_{\rm
m}=0$, another limit-cycle oscillation between $\theta_0-\pi$ and $-\theta_0$
is found to appear. In the steady flow, $\theta$ periodically rotates
(tumbling) at high $\eta_{\rm {in}}$, and $\theta$ and the vesicle shape
oscillate (swinging) at middle $\eta_{\rm {in}}$ and high shear rate. In the
oscillatory flow, the coexistence of two or more limit-cycle oscillations can
occur for low $f_{\gamma}$ in these phases. For the vesicle with a fixed shape,
the angle $\theta$ rotates back to the original position after an oscillation
period. However, it is found that a preferred angle can be induced by small
thermal fluctuations.

with a very efficient Newton-Krylov inversion scheme. Furthermore, we have
tested it with a dark matter N-body simulation assuming a unit galaxy bias
relation and compared the results with previous density field estimators like
the inverse weighting scheme and Wiener filtering. Our results show good
agreement with the underlying dark matter field for overdensities even above
delta~1000 which exceeds by one order of magnitude the regime in which the
lognormal is expected to be valid. The reason is that for our filter the
lognormal assumption enters as a prior distribution function, but the maximum a
posteriori solution is also conditioned on the data. We find that the lognormal
filter is superior to the previous filtering schemes in terms of higher
correlation coefficients and smaller Euclidean distances to the underlying

simple triangular lattice of particles connected by harmonic springs in
two-dimensions. Coarse-graining local strains obtained from particle
configurations in a Monte Carlo simulation generates non-trivial, non-local
strain correlations (susceptibilities), which may be understood within a
generalized, Landau type elastic Hamiltonian containing up to quartic terms in
strain gradients (K. Franzrahe et al., Phys. Rev. E 78, 026106 (2008)). In
order to demonstrate the versatility of the analysis of these correlations and
to make our calculations directly relevant for experiments on colloidal solids,
we systematically study various parameters such as the choice of statistical
ensemble, presence of external pressure and boundary conditions. We show that
special care needs to be taken for an accurate application of our results to
actual experiments, where the analyzed area is embedded within a larger system,
to which it is mechanically coupled. Apart from the smooth, affine strain
fields, the coarse-graining procedure also gives rise to a noise field made up
of non-affine displacements. Several properties of this noise field may be
rationalized for the harmonic solid using a simple ""cell model"" calculation.
Furthermore the scaling behavior of the probability distribution of the noise

nature that can reveal physics beyond the Standard Model. A good theoretical
understanding of the low energy properties of QCD is required for this purpose.
The recent developments at the interface between lattice and effective field
theory methods provide an excellent basis for pion physics already now, while
the extension required to explore the low energy properties in the strange
quark sector yet calls for further work, also in view of a better determination
of the light quark masses.
  At the precision achieved in lattice determination of quark mass ratios, the
e.m. self-energies of the mesons play an important role. I point out some
unresolved issues occurring in this context and then summarize the present
knowledge of the light quark masses.

different humans are introduced. 2) The probability density functions (PDF,
p(X)) of the EEG voltages (X) are normal (Gauss) for OO whereas, the plots for
the distributions of HO (pure) are convex. Gaussians for OO may turn to be
convex as HO become dominant in MO or vice versa. However, distributions of the
most of the data are found normal which means that most of the EEG oscillations
consist of OO (or MO). 3) Shannon entropies (information measures) of the
distributions of the data from different brain regions in the ictal intervals
or inter-ictal intervals are calculated for each individual recording and
compared. The averages of Shannon entropies over the individual recordings
during the ictal intervals come out bigger than those from the inter-ictal
intervals. These averages are found to be bigger for the data from
epileptogenic brain areas than those recorded from non epileptogenic ones in
different intervals.

resolution spectra obtained with the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) on-board

  We find that on average, the 15-30micron slope of the continuum is
-0.85+/-0.61 for Seyfert 1s and -1.53+/-0.84 for Seyfert 2s, and there is
substantial scatter in each type. Moreover, nearly 32% of Seyfert 1s, and 9% of
Seyfert 2s, display a peak in the mid-infrared spectrum at 20micron, which is
attributed to an additional hot dust component. The Polycyclic Aromatic
Hydrocarbon (PAH) equivalent width decreases with increasing dust temperature,
as indicated by the global infrared color of the host galaxies. However, no
statistical difference in PAH equivalent width is detected between the two
Seyfert types, 1 and 2, of the same bolometric luminosity. Finally, we propose
a new method to estimate the AGN contribution to the integrated 12micron galaxy
emission, by subtracting the ""star formation"" component in the Seyfert
galaxies, making use of the tight correlation between PAH 11.2micron luminosity
and 12micron luminosity for star forming galaxies.
