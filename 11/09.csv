mediators that produce Majorana masses of the known neutrinos. The gauge
quantum number assignment to the Dirac mediators allows them to belong to a
weak triplet and a five-plet of nonzero hypercharge. The latter leads to new
seesaw formula m_\nu ~ v^6/M^5, so that the empirical masses m_\nu ~ 10^{-1} eV
can be achieved by M ~ TeV new states. There is a limited range of the
parameter space with M < a few 100 GeV where the tree level contribution
dominates over the respective loop contributions and the proposed mechanism is
testable at the LHC. We discuss specific signatures for Dirac type heavy
leptons produced by Drell-Yan fusion at the LHC.

questions about the structure and evolution of our Galaxy. Over the last
decade, surveys and individual observations from the ground and space have led
to an explosion of astrometric, kinematic and multiwavelength photometric and
spectroscopic open cluster data. In addition, a growing fraction of these data

developments in classification techniques, the open cluster system reveals an
increasingly clearer and more complete picture of our Galaxy. In this

Therefore, the probability space behaves like a gauge parameter. We discuss the

quantum entangled states and even `super-quantum' systems. We exhibit bipartite
examples leading to maximum violation of Bell-CHSH inequalities like EPR pairs

simulating GHZ or W-states. We address also the question of partially
correlated systems and multipartite entanglements. In this model, the classical
equivalent of the entanglement entropy is identified with the Kullback-Leibler

multipartite systems, leading to a simple evaluation of the degree of
entanglement and determining the bounds of maximum entanglement. Finally, we
obtain a constructive necessary and sufficient condition of multipartite
entanglement.

In the former case, for which the migration time is comparable to the lifetime
of the protoplanetary gas disk, a 2:1 resonance may be formed. In the latter,
relatively rapid migration regime commensurabilities of high degree such as 8:7
or 11:10 may be formed. However, in any one large-scale migration several
different commensurabilities may be formed sequentially, each being associated
with significant orbital evolution. We also use a simple analytic theory to
develop conditions for first order commensurabilities to be formed. These
depend on the degree of the commensurability, the imposed migration and
circularization rates, and the planet mass ratios. These conditions are found
to be consistent with the results of our simulations.

is too high for the mass derived from their age and total luminosity, which has
led to the suggestion that they are not in virial equilibrium. Most of these
clusters are confined to a narrow age range centred around 10 Myr because of
observational constraints. At this age the cluster light is dominated by
luminous evolved stars, such as red supergiants, with initial masses of ~13-22
Msun for which (primordial) binarity is high. In this study we investigate to
what extent the observed excess velocity dispersion is the result of the
orbital motions of binaries. We demonstrate that estimates for the dynamical
mass of young star clusters, derived from the observed velocity dispersion,
exceed the photometric mass by up-to a factor of 10 and are consistent with a
constant offset in the square of the velocity dispersion. This can be
reproduced by models of virialised star clusters hosting a massive star
population of which ~25 is in binaries, with typical mass ratios of ~0.6 and
periods of ~1000 days. We conclude that binaries play a pivotal role in
deriving the dynamical masses of young (~10 Myr) moderately massive and compact

includes the use of entangled Gaussian probe states. We prove that the metric

We prove that optimal probe states are always pure and bounded in the number of

the complexity of optimal experimental setups for channel estimation and
reduces the computational requirements for the evaluation of the metric:

often define twisted index in a subspace of the moduli space which captures

function. However for large charges the logarithm of this index grows as 1/n
times the entropy of a black hole carrying the same charges where n is the
order of the symmetry generator that is used to define the twisted index. We
provide a macroscopic explanation of this phenomenon using quantum entropy

operators permitted by the supergravity formalism and find that the field

possible Planck scale suppressed terms which can potentially remove the domain
walls safely. However, the parity breaking scale, equivalently the majorana

spacetimes that were found by Carter to have separable Hamilton-Jacobi
equations, and thus admit a second-order Killing tensor. The derivation of the
spacetimes presented in this paper borrows from ideas about dynamical systems,
and illustrates concepts that can be generalized to higher- order Killing
tensors. The relationship between the components of the Killing equations and
metric functions are given explicitly. The origin of the four separable
coordinate systems found by Carter is explained and classified in terms of the
analytic structure associated with the Killing equations. A geometric picture
of what the orbital invariants may represent is built. Requiring that a SAV
spacetime admits a second-order Killing tensor is very restrictive, selecting
very few candidates from the group of all possible SAV spacetimes. This
restriction arises due to the fact that the consistency conditions associated
with the Killing equations require that the field variables obey a second-order
differential equation, as opposed to a fourth-order differential equation that
imposes the weaker condition that the spacetime be SAV. This paper introduces
ideas that could lead to the explicit computation of more general orbital
invariants in the form of higher-order Killing Tensors.

generalized and energy solutions are quite flexible and can be used to address
gradient flows in a variety of contexts, ranging from Banach spaces to
Wasserstein spaces of probability measures.

vorticity fluctuations in high-Reynolds-number turbulence in a differentially
rotating neutron star is calculated analytically, as are the amplitude and
decoherence time of the resulting, stochastic gravitational wave signal. The
calculation resolves the subtle question of whether the signal is dominated by
the smallest or largest turbulent eddies: for the Kolmogorov-like power
spectrum observed in superfluid spherical Couette simulations, the wave strain
is controlled by the largest eddies, and the decoherence time approximately
equals the maximum eddy turnover time. For a neutron star with spin frequency
$\nu_s$ and Rossby number $Ro$, at a distance $d$ from Earth, the
root-mean-square wave strain reaches $h_{RMS} \approx 3\times 10^{-24} Ro^3
(\nu_s / 30 Hz)^3 (d/1 kpc)^{-1}$. A cross-correlation search can detect such a
source in principle, because the signal decoheres over the time-scale $\tau_c
\approx 10^{-3} Ro^{-1} (\nu_s / 30 Hz)^{-1} s$, which is adequately sampled by
existing long-baseline interferometers. Hence hydrodynamic turbulence imposes a
fundamental noise floor on gravitational wave observations of neutron stars,
although its polluting effect may be muted by partial decoherence in the
hectohertz band, where current continuous-wave searches are concentrated, for
the highest frequency (and hence most powerful) sources.

relate how the time to synchrony depends on coupling strength and connection
dynamics to the latency between neuronal stimulation and conscious awareness.
We suggest that this latency can be identified with the delay before a
threshold level of synchrony is achieved between distinct regions within the

easily be understood as the inevitable delay before such synchrony builds-up.
This is demonstrated here through the study of simplistic coupled-map models.

optimally if I become more inclined to ignore you with each irrelevant
recommendation you make? Finding an answer to these questions is a key
challenge in all forms of marketing that rely on and explore social ties;
ranging from personal recommendations to viral marketing.
  In the first part of this paper, we show that there can be no pricing
mechanism that is ""truthful"" with respect to the seller, and we use solution
concepts from coalitional game theory, namely the Core, the Shapley Value, and
the Nash Bargaining Solution, to derive provably ""fair"" prices for settings
with one or multiple recommenders. We then investigate pricing mechanisms for
the setting where recommenders have different ""purchase arguments"". Here we
show that it might be beneficial for the recommenders to withhold some of their
arguments, unless anonymity-proof solution concepts, such as the
anonymity-proof Shapley value, are used.
  In the second part of this paper, we analyze the setting where the
recommendee loses trust in the recommender for each irrelevant recommendation.
Here we prove that even if the recommendee regains her initial trust on each
successful recommendation, the expected total profit the recommender can make
over an infinite period is bounded. This can only be overcome when the
recommendee also incrementally regains trust during periods without any
recommendation. Here, we see an interesting connection to ""banner blindness"",
suggesting that showing fewer ads can lead to a higher long-term profit.

By carefully analyzing the classical limit we precisely quantify the
distinction between strong-field QED Compton scattering and classical Thomson
scattering. A purely classical, but fully covariant, calculation of the
bremsstrahlung emitted by an electron in a plane wave laser field yields
radiation into harmonics, as expected. This result is generalized to pulses of
finite duration and explains the appearance of line broadening and harmonic
substructure as an interference phenomenon. The ensuing numerical treatment
confirms that strong focussing of the laser leads to a broad continuum while
higher harmonics become visible only at moderate focussing, hence lower
intensity. We present a scaling law for the backscattered photon spectral
density which facilitates averaging over electron beam phase space. Finally, we
propose a set of realistic parameters such that the observation of intensity

probabilities fail to provide efficient simulations. For example, we show how
various concatenations of matchgate, Toffoli, Clifford, bounded-depth, Fourier

sparse quantum circuits as well as circuits composed of CNOT and exp[iaX] gates

simulation of quantum algorithms. It is shown that a recent quantum algorithm,
concerned with the estimation of Potts model partition functions, can be
simulated efficiently classically. Finally, we show that the exponential
speed-ups of Simon's and Shor's algorithms crucially depend on the very last

theory for a quantum description of gravity. When applied to the entire
universe, the so-called Loop Quantum Cosmology (L.Q.C.) framework offers
microscopical models of the very early stages of the cosmological history,
potentially solving the initial singularity problem via bouncing solutions or
setting the universe in the appropriate initial conditions for inflation to
start, via a phase of super-inflation. More interestingly, L.Q.C. could leave a
footprint on cosmological observables such as the Cosmic Microwave Background
(CMB) anisotropies. Focusing on the modified dispersion relation when holonomy
and inverse-volume corrections arising from the L.Q.C. framework are
considered, it is shown that primordial gravity waves generated during
inflation are affected by quantum corrections. Depending on the type of
corrections, the primordial tensor power spectrum is either suppressed or
boosted at large length scales, and strongly departs from the power-law
behavior expected in the standard scenario.

averaging our data we make the first significant detection of the white dwarf
ingress in this system and find the phase width of the white dwarf eclipse to
be 0.0935 +/- 0.0003, significantly higher than the previous best value of
between 0.0863 and 0.0918. The mass ratio is found to be q = M2 /M1 = 0.48 +/-
0.01, consistent with previous measurements, but we find the inclination to be
83.8 +/- 0.5 deg, significantly higher than previously reported. We find the
radius of the white dwarf to be 0.0063 +/- 0.0003 solar radii, implying a white
dwarf mass of 1.16 +/- 0.02 solar masses. The donor mass is 0.55 +/- 0.02 solar

of absorption by disc material. Our best estimate of the temperature is 10,000

with velocities $v \sim 0.1c$ and ionization parameters up to $\xi \sim 10^4$
(cgs), implying the presence of resonance lines of helium-- and hydrogenlike
iron. These properties are direct consequences of momentum and mass
conservation respectively, and agree with recent X-ray observations of fast
outflows from AGN. Because the wind is significantly subluminal, it can persist
long after the AGN is observed to have become sub--Eddington. The wind creates
a strong cooling shock as it interacts with the interstellar medium of the host
galaxy, and this cooling region may be observable in an inverse Compton
continuum and lower--excitation emission lines associated with lower
velocities. The shell of matter swept up by the (`momentum--driven') shocked
wind must propagate beyond the black hole's sphere of influence on a timescale
$\la 3\times 10^5$ yr. Outside this radius the shell stalls unless the black
hole mass has reached the value $M_{\sigma}$ implied by the $M - \sigma$
relation. If the wind shock did not cool, as suggested here, the resulting
(`energy--driven') outflow would imply a far smaller SMBH mass than actually
observed. In galaxies with large bulges the black hole may grow somewhat beyond
this value, suggesting that the observed $M -\sigma$ relation may curve upwards
at large $M$. Minor accretion events with small gas fractions can produce
galaxy--wide outflows with velocities significantly exceeding $\sigma$,
including fossil outflows in galaxies where there is little current AGN
activity. Some rare cases may reveal the energy--driven outflows which sweep
gas out of the galaxy and establish the black hole--bulge mass relation.
However these require the quasar to be at the Eddington luminosity.

cold, dense, and quiescent clumps of gas. We propose that such clumps near an
HH object can be used as a general measure of clumpiness in the molecular cloud
that contains that HH object. Our aim is to make a survey of clumps around a
sample of HH objects, and to use the results to make an estimate of the
clumpiness in molecular clouds. All known cold, dense, and quiescent clumps
near HH objects are anomalously strong HCO+ emitters. Our method is, therefore,
to search for strong HCO+ emission as an indicator of a clump near to an HH
object. The searches were made using JCMT and SEST in the HCO+ 3-2 and also
H13CO+ 1-0 lines, with some additional searches for methanol and sulphur
monoxide lines. The sources selected were a sample of 22 HH objects in which no
previous HCO+ emission had been detected. We find that half of the HH objects
have clumps detected in the HCO+ 3-2 line and that all searches in H13CO$+ 1-0
lines show evidence of clumpiness. All condensations have narrow linewidths and
are evidently unaffected dynamically by the HH jet shock. We conclude that the
molecular clouds in which these HH objects are found must be highly
heterogeneous on scales of less than 0.1 pc. An approximate calculation based
on these results suggests that the area filling factor of clumps affected by HH
objects is on the order of 10%. These clumps have gas number densities larger

deal with the quantization of a reduced space M_red. We shall be concerned here
mainly with the classical Marsden-Weinstein reduction, assuming that we have a
proper action of a Lie group G on a Poisson manifold M, with a moment map J for
which zero is a regular value. For the quantization, we follow [BHW] (with a
simplified approach) and build a star product *_red on M_red from a strongly
invariant star product * on M. The new questions which are addressed in this
paper concern the existence of natural *-involutions on the reduced quantum
algebra and the representation theory for such a reduced *-algebra. We assume
that * is Hermitian and we show that the choice of a formal series of smooth
densities on the embedded coisotropic submanifold C = J^{-1}(0), with some
equivariance property, defines a *-involution for *_red on the reduced space.
Looking into the question whether the corresponding *-involution is the complex
conjugation (which is a *-involution in the Marsden-Weinstein context) yields a
new notion of quantized unimodular class. We introduce a left *-submodule and a
right *_red-submodule C^\infty_cf(C)[[lambda]] of C^\infty(C)[[lambda]]; we
define on it a C^\infty(M_red)[[lambda]]-valued inner product and we establish
that this gives a strong Morita equivalence bimodule between
C^\infty(M_red)[[lambda]] and the finite rank operators on
C^\inftycf(C)[[lambda]]. The crucial point is here to show the complete
positivity of the inner product. We obtain a Rieffel induction functor from the
strongly non-degenerate *-representations of (C^\infty(M_red)[[lambda]], *_red)

with respect to the Galactic value as due to a large column density (about

consistent with the infrared transient's properties. Re-analysis of the prompt

must be treated explicitely, whereas the rapidly time-dependent intrinsic
excitations can be treated by statistical approximations. More precisely, we
introduce a reference density which represents the slow evolution of the

shape of the nuclear density distribution is described by parameters

derive a rigorous equation of motion for the reference density and,
subsequently, simplify this equation on the basis of the Markov approximation.
The temperature which appears in the canonical distribution is determined by
the requirement that, at each time t, the reference density should correctly
reproduce the mean excitation energy at given values of the shape parameters.
The resulting equation for the ""local"" temperature must be solved together with

Quite interestingly it is observed that, for $\phi=\phi_0/2$ ($\phi_0=ch/e$,
the elementary flux-quantum) a high output current (1) (in the logical sense)
appears if one, and only one, of the inputs to the gate is high (1), while if
both inputs are low (0) or both are high (1), a low output current (0) appears.

the row widths by vertically partitioning tables into table fractions in order
to minimize the number of irrelevant columns/attributes read by each

relational row-store OLTP databases with an H-store-like architecture, meaning
that we would like to maximize the number of single-sited transactions. We
present a model for the vertical partitioning problem that, given a schema
together with a vertical partitioning and a workload, estimates the costs
(bytes read/written by storage layer access methods and bytes transferred
between sites) of evaluating the workload on the given partitioning. The cost
model allows for arbitrarily prioritizing load balancing of sites vs. total
cost minimization. We show that finding a minimum-cost vertical partitioning in
this model is NP-hard and present two algorithms returning solutions in which
single-sitedness of read queries is preserved while allowing column replication
(which may allow a drastically reduced cost compared to disjoint partitioning).
The first algorithm is a quadratic integer program that finds optimal
minimum-cost solutions with respect to the model, and the second algorithm is a
more scalable heuristic based on simulated annealing. Experiments show that the
algorithms can reduce the cost of the model objective by 37% when applied to
the TPC-C benchmark and the heuristic is shown to obtain solutions with cost

molecular nanomagnets (MNMs). Through measurements on protonated and deuterated
samples of the MNMs Cr7Mn (S=1) and Cr8 (S=0), we show that the muon spin for
$S \neq 0$ MNMs is relaxed via dynamic fluctuations of the electronic spins. A
freezing out of dynamic processes occurs on cooling and at low temperatures the
muon spins are relaxed by the electronic spins which themselves are dephased by
incoherent nuclear field fluctuations.We observe a transition to a state of
static magnetic order of the MNM electronic spins in Cr7Mn below 2 K.

estimation error. This poses a fundamental problem, because solutions that are
not stable under sample fluctuations may look optimal for a given sample, but
are, in effect, very far from optimal with respect to the average risk. In this
paper, we approach the problem from the point of view of statistical learning
theory. The occurrence of the instability is intimately related to over-fitting
which can be avoided using known regularization methods. We show how
regularized portfolio optimization with the expected shortfall as a risk
measure is related to support vector regression. The budget constraint dictates
a modification. We present the resulting optimization problem and discuss the
solution. The L2 norm of the weight vector is used as a regularizer, which
corresponds to a diversification ""pressure"". This means that diversification,
besides counteracting downward fluctuations in some assets by upward
fluctuations in others, is also crucial because it improves the stability of
the solution. The approach we provide here allows for the simultaneous
treatment of optimization and diversification in one framework that enables the
investor to trade-off between the two, depending on the size of the available
data set.

the existence of combinatorial objects meeting a prescribed collection of

general geometric setting, where events are replaced with subspaces and
probability is replaced with relative dimension, which allows to lower bound
the dimension of the intersection of vector spaces under certain independence
conditions. Our result immediately applies to the k-QSAT problem: For instance
we show that any collection of rank 1 projectors with the property that each
qubit appears in at most $2^k/(e \cdot k)$ of them, has a joint satisfiable
state.
  We then apply our results to the recently studied model of random k-QSAT.
Recent works have shown that the satisfiable region extends up to a density of
1 in the large k limit, where the density is the ratio of projectors to qubits.
Using a hybrid approach building on work by Laumann et al. we greatly extend
the known satisfiable region for random k-QSAT to a density of
$\Omega(2^k/k^2)$. Since our tool allows us to show the existence of joint
satisfying states without the need to construct them, we are able to penetrate
into regions where the satisfying states are conjectured to be entangled,
avoiding the need to construct them, which has limited previous approaches to
product states.

We show that mean-field theory takes into account the dominant interaction
effects for experimentally relevant trap geometries. Comparing with Quantum
Monte Carlo calculations, we quantify the onset of the fluctuation regime,
where correlations beyond mean-field become important. Although the density
profile depends on the microscopic parameters of the system, we show that the
correlation density (the difference between the exact and the mean-field
density) is accurately described by a universal expression, obtained from
classical-field calculations of the homogeneous strictly two-dimensional gas.
Deviations from universality, due to the finite value of the interaction or to
the trap geometry, are shown to be small for current experiments. We further
study coherence and pair correlations on a microscopic scale. Finite-size
effects in the off-diagonal density matrix allows us to characterize the
cross-over from Kosterlitz-Thouless to Bose-Einstein behavior for small

density-functional definitions of spin-conserving gaps, spin-flip gaps and the
spin stiffness in terms of many-body energies and in terms of single-particle
(Kohn-Sham) energies. Our definitions are as analogous as possible to those
commonly made in the charge case, but important differences between spin and
charge gaps emerge already on the single-particle level because unlike the
fundamental charge gap spin gaps involve excited-state energies. Kohn-Sham and
many-body spin gaps are predicted to differ, and the difference is related to
derivative discontinuities that are similar to, but distinct from, those
usually considered in the case of charge gaps. Both ensemble DFT and
time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) can be used to calculate these spin discontinuities
from a suitable functional. We illustrate our findings by evaluating our
definitions for the Lithium atom, for which we calculate spin gaps and spin
discontinuities by making use of near-exact Kohn-Sham eigenvalues and,
independently, from the single-pole approximation to TDDFT. The many-body
corrections to the Kohn-Sham spin gaps are found to be negative, i.e., single
