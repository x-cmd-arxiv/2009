quantitatively compute the cross section for DM annihilation to nearby excited
states, mediated by exchange of a new light gauge boson with off-diagonal
couplings to the DM states. In models where both excited states must be heavy
enough to decay into e^+ e^- and the ground state, the predicted rate of
positron production is never large enough to agree with observations, unless
one makes extreme assumptions about the local circular velocity in the Milky
Way, or alternatively if there exists a metastable population of DM states
which can be excited through a mass gap of less than 650 keV, before decaying
into electrons and positrons.

loud/quiet dichotomy can be due to differences in the spin of the central black
holes that power the radio-emitting jets. Using general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we construct steady state axisymmetric
numerical models for a wide range of black hole spins (dimensionless spin
parameter 0.1 <= a <= 0.9999 and a variety of jet geometries. We assume that
the total magnetic flux through the black hole horizon at radius r_H(a) is held
constant. If the black hole is surrounded by a thin accretion disk, we find
that the total black hole power output depends approximately quadratically on
the angular frequency of the hole, P \propto \Omega_H^2 \propto (a/r_H)^2. We
conclude that, in this scenario, differences in the black hole spin can produce
power variations of only a few tens at most. However, if the disk is thick such
that the jet subtends a narrow solid angle around the polar axis, then the
power dependence becomes much steeper, P \propto \Omega_H^4 or even \propto
\Omega_H^6. Power variations of 1000 are then possible for realistic black hole
spin distributions. We derive an analytic solution that accurately reproduces
the steeper scaling of jet power with \Omega_H, and we provide a numerical
fitting formula that reproduces all our simulation results. We discuss other
physical effects that might contribute to the observed radio loud/quiet
dichotomy of AGN.

cluster richness using total and gas masses measured from stacked ROSAT X-ray
data and stellar masses estimated from the infrared galaxy catalogs. We detect
X-ray emission even in the outskirts of clusters, beyond r_200 for richness
classes with X-ray temperatures above 1 keV. This enables us to more accurately
determine the total gas mass in these groups and clusters. We find that the
optically selected groups and clusters have flatter temperature profiles and
higher stellar-to-gas mass ratios than the individually studied, X-ray bright
clusters. We also find that the stellar mass in poor groups with temperatures
below 1 keV is comparable to the gas mass in these systems. Combining these
results with individual measurements for clusters, groups, and galaxies from
the literature, we find a break in the baryon fraction at ~1 keV. Above this
temperature, the baryon fraction scales with temperature as f_b \propto
T^0.20\pm0.03. We see significantly smaller baryon fractions below this
temperature, and the baryon fraction of poor groups joins smoothly onto that of
systems with still shallower potential wells such as normal and dwarf galaxies
where the baryon fraction scales with the inferred velocity dispersion as f_b
\propto \sigma^1.6. The small scatter in the baryon fraction at any given
potential well depth favors a universal baryon loss mechanism and a preheating
model for the baryon loss. The scatter is, however, larger for less massive
systems. Finally, we note that although the broken power-law relation can be
inferred from data points in the literature alone, the consistency between the
baryon fractions for poor groups and massive galaxies inspires us to fit the
two categories of objects (galaxies and clusters) with one relation.

the infinitesimal cross-section of light bundle in the optical limit, and maps
galaxy intrinsic shapes into their angular images. The calculation is done in
the Poisson gauge without a specific matter content, including vector and
tensor perturbations generated at second order and taking account of the
inhomogeneities of a fixed redshift source plane. Our final result is expressed
in terms of spin-2 operators on the sphere and is valid on the full sky. Beside
the well known lens-lens and Born corrections that dominate on small angular
scales, we find new non-linear couplings. These are a purely general
relativistic intrinsic contribution, a coupling between the gravitational
potential at the source with the lens, couplings between the time delay with
the lens, couplings between two photon deflections, as well as non-linear
couplings due to the second-order vector and tensor components. The
inhomogeneity in the redshift of the source induces a coupling between the
photon redshift with the lens. All these corrections become important on large
angular scales and should thus be included when computing higher-order
observables such as the bispectrum, in full or partially full-sky surveys.

Sky Survey (SDSS) at both large (50-500 kpc/h) and small (~3 kpc/h) scales.
Weak lensing observations in the outskirts of the halo are combined with
measurements of the stellar velocity dispersion in the interior regions of the
galaxy for stacked galaxy samples. The weak lensing measurements are well
characterized by a Navarro, Frenk and White (NFW) profile. The dynamical mass
measurements exceed the extrapolated NFW profile even after the estimated
stellar masses are subtracted, providing evidence for the modification of the
dark matter profile by the baryons. This excess mass is quantitatively
consistent with the predictions of the adiabatic contraction (AC) hypothesis.
Our finding suggests that the effects of AC during galaxy formation are stable
to subsequent bombardment from major and minor mergers. We explore several
theoretical and observational systematics and conclude that they cannot account
for the inferred mass excess. The most significant source of systematic error
is in the IMF, which would have to increase the stellar mass estimates by a
factor of two relative to masses from the Kroupa IMF to fully explain the mass
excess without AC. Such an increase would create tension with results from
SAURON (Cappellari et al. 2006). We demonstrate a connection between the level
of contraction of the dark matter halo profile and scatter in the
size-luminosity relation, which is a projection of the fundamental plane.
Whether or not AC is the mechanism supplying the excess mass, models of galaxy
formation and evolution must reconcile the observed halo masses from weak
lensing with the comparatively large dynamical masses at the half light radii
of the galaxies.

spectrum of the nebula in the energy range 100 MeV - 300 GeV is well described
by the sum of two power-laws of indices Gamma_{sync} = (3.99 \pm 0.12 \pm 0.08)

the synchrotron and the rising edge of the inverse Compton components,

points of Cherenkov experiments, is well reproduced via inverse Compton

graph theory. The force-distance curves corresponding to repeated pulling
events are mapped onto their correlation network (mathematical graph). On these
graphs the groups of similar curves appear as topological modules, which are
identified using the spectral analysis of graphs. We demonstrate the approach
by analyzing a large ensemble of the force-distance curves measured on:
ssDNA-ssDNA, peptide-RNA (system from HIV1), and peptide-Au surface. Within our
data sets the methodology systematically separates subgroups of curves which
are related to different intermolecular interactions and to spatial
arrangements in which the molecules are brought together and/or pulling speeds.
This demonstrates the sensitivity of the method to the spatial degrees of

by the three SO(2,4) conserved charges: the energy E and the two spins S_1 and
S_2. We discuss several examples of explicit classical solutions for rigid
closed strings of (bended) circular shape with two non-zero spins. In
particular, we identify a solution that should represent a state that has
minimal energy for large values of the two equal spins. Similarly to the spiky
string in AdS_3, in the large spin limit this string develops long ""arcs"" that
stretch towards the boundary of AdS_5. This allows the string to increase the
spin while having the energy growing only logarithmically with S=S_1 +S_2. The
large spin asymptotics of such solutions is effectively controlled by their
near-boundary parts which, as in the spiky string case, happen to be SO(2,4)
equivalent to segments of the straight folded spinning string. As a result, the
coefficient of the \log S term in the string energy should be given, up to an

associated to the secular angle $\theta = \varpi - \varpi_\odot$, where
$\varpi$ is the longitude of pericenter of the satellite and $\varpi_\odot$
corresponds to the (fixed) planetocentric orbit of the Sun. Our study is
performed in the restricted three-body problem, where the satellites are
considered as massless particles around a massive planet and perturbed by the
Sun. Depending on the initial conditions, the resonance presents a diversity of
possible resonant modes, including librations of $\theta$ around zero (as found
for Sinope and Pasiphae) or 180 degrees, as well as asymmetric librations (e.g.
Narvi). Symmetric modes are present in all giant planets, although each regime
appears restricted to certain values of the satellite inclination. Asymmetric
solutions, on the other hand, seem absent around Neptune due to its almost
circular heliocentric orbit. Simulating the effects of a smooth orbital
migration on the satellite, we find that the resonance lock is preserved as
long as the induced change in semimajor axis is much slower compared to the
period of the resonant angle (adiabatic limit). However, the librational mode
may vary during the process, switching between symmetric and asymmetric
oscillations. Finally, we present a simple scaling transformation that allows
to estimate the resonant structure around any giant planet from the results

a Salpeter mass function.The presence of a different star generation in the

dispersion ($M_{\rm bh} - \sigma$) correlation may be established when
winds/outflows from the SMBH drive gas out of the potential wells of classical
bulges. Here we present numerical simulations of this process in a static
isothermal potential. Simple spherically symmetric models of SMBH feedback at
the Eddington luminosity can successfully explain the $M_{\rm bh} - \sigma$ and
nuclear cluster mass $M_{\rm NC}-\sigma$ correlations, as well as why larger
bulges host SMBHs while smaller ones host nuclear star clusters. However these
models do not specify how SMBHs feed on infalling gas whilst simultaneously
producing feedback that drives gas out of the galaxy.
  More complex models with rotation and/or anisotropic feedback allow SMBHs to
feed via a disc or regions not exposed to SMBH winds, but in these more
realistic cases it is not clear why a robust $M_{\rm bh} - \sigma$ relation
should be established. In fact, some of the model predictions contradict
observations. For example, an isotropic SMBH wind impacting on a disc (rather
than a shell) of aspect ratio $H/R \ll 1$ requires the SMBH mass to be larger
by a factor $\sim R/H$, which is opposite to what is observed. We conclude that
understanding how a SMBH feeds is as important a piece of the puzzle as
understanding how its feedback affects its host galaxy.
  Finally, we note that in aspherical cases the SMBH outflows induce
differential motions in the bulge. This may pump turbulence that is known to
hinder star formation in star forming regions. SMBH feedback thus may not only
drive gas out of the bulge but also reduce the fraction of gas turned into
stars.

effectiveness as approximations in critically loaded regimes needs to be

computationally intractable. To address that concern, this paper focuses on
developing a methodology by adjusting the fluid and diffusion models so that
they significantly improve the estimation accuracy. We illustrate the accuracy

three of which contain dense ringlets. Observations of stellar occultations by
the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer onboard the Cassini spacecraft
have yielded ~40 accurate and precise measurements of the radial position of
the edges of all of these gaps and ringlets. These data reveal suggestive
patterns in the shapes of many of the gap edges: the outer edges of the 5 gaps
without ringlets are circular to within 1 km, while the inner edges of 6 of the
gaps are eccentric, with apsidal precession rates consistent with those
expected for eccentric orbits near each edge. Intriguingly, the pattern speeds
of these eccentric inner gap edges, together with that of the eccentric Huygens
ringlet,form a series with a characteristic spacing of 0.06 degrees/day. The
two gaps with non-eccentric inner edges lie near first-order Inner Lindblad
Resonances (ILRs) with moons. One such edge is close to the 5:4 ILR with
Prometheus. The other resonantly confined edge is the outer edge of the B ring,
which lies near the 2:1 Mimas ILR. Detailed investigation of the B-ring-edge
data confirm the presence of an m=2 perturbation on the B-ring edge, but also
suggest that this pattern moves or librates relative to Mimas. The B-ring edge
also has an m=1 component that rotates around the planet at a rate close to the
expected apsidal precession rate. The pattern speeds of the eccentric edges in
the Cassini Division can potentially be generated from various combinations of
the pattern speeds of structures observed on the edge of the B ring. We
therefore suggest that the locations of most of the gaps in the Cassini
Division may be determined by resonances involving a combination of
perturbations from Mimas and the massive edge of the B ring.

nonhyperbolicity called unstable dimension variability (UDV), for which the
chaotic invariant set contains periodic orbits possessing different numbers of
unstable eigendirections. The onset of UDV is usually related to the loss of
transversal stability of an unstable fixed point embedded in the chaotic set.
In this paper, we present a new mechanism for the onset of UDV, whereby the
period of the unstable orbits losing transversal stability tends to infinity as
we approach the onset of UDV. This mechanism is unveiled by means of a periodic
orbit analysis of the invariant chaotic attractor for two model dynamical
systems with phase spaces of low dimensionality, and seems to depend heavily on
the chaotic dynamics in the invariant set. We also described, for these
systems, the blowout bifurcation (for which the chaotic set as a whole loses
transversal stability) and its relation with the situation where the effects of
UDV are the most intense. For the latter point, we found that chaotic
trajectories off, but very close to, the invariant set exhibit the same scaling
characteristic of the so-called on-off intermittency.

(SZ) cluster signals are measured at 150 GHz, and concurrent 220 GHz data are
used to reduce astrophysical contamination. Radial profiles are computed using
a technique that takes into account the effects of the beams and filtering. In
several clusters, significant SZ decrements are detected out to a substantial
fraction of the virial radius. The profiles are fit to the beta model and to a
generalized NFW pressure profile, and are scaled and stacked to probe their
average behavior. We find model parameters that are consistent with previous
studies: beta=0.86 and r_core/r_500 = 0.20 for the beta model, and (alpha,
beta, gamma, c_500)=(1.0,5.5,0.5,1.0) for the generalized NFW model. Both
models fit the SPT data comparably well, and both are consistent with the
average SZ profile out to the virial radius. The integrated Compton-y parameter
Y_SZ is computed for each cluster using both model-dependent and
model-independent techniques, and the results are compared to X-ray estimates
of cluster parameters. We find that Y_SZ scales with Y_X and gas mass with low
scatter. Since these observables have been found to scale with total mass, our
results point to a tight mass-observable relation for the SPT cluster survey.

wavelengths using data from moderately deep fields observed by both Chandra and
Spitzer. The X-ray-selected AGN sample and associated optical follow-up are
drawn from the SEXSI program. Mid-infrared data in these fields are derived
from Spitzer imaging, and mid-infrared AGN selection is accomplished primarily
through application of the IRAC color-color AGN `wedge' selection technique.
Nearly all X-ray sources in these fields which exhibit clear spectroscopic
signatures of AGN activity have mid-infrared colors consistent with IRAC AGN
selection. These are predominantly the most luminous X-ray sources. X-ray
sources that lack high-ionization and/or broad lines in their optical spectra
are far less likely to be selected as AGN by mid-infrared color selection
techniques. The fraction of X-ray sources identified as AGN in the mid-infrared
increases monotonically as the X-ray luminosity increases. Conversely, only 22%
of mid-infrared-selected AGN are detected at X-ray energies in the moderately
deep (~100 ks) Chandra data. We hypothesize that the IRAC AGN that lack X-ray
detections are predominantly high-luminosity AGN that are obscured and/or lie
at high redshift. A stacking analysis of X-ray-undetected sources shows that
objects in the mid-infrared AGN selection wedge have average X-ray fluxes in
the 2-8 keV band three times higher than sources that fall outside the wedge.
Their X-ray spectra are also harder. It is evident from this comparative study
that in order to create a complete, unbiased census of supermassive black hole
growth and evolution, a combination of sensitive infrared, X-ray and hard X-ray
selection is required. We conclude by discussing what samples will be provided
by upcoming survey missions such as WISE, eROSITA, and NuSTAR.

graph can be reduced to a smaller matrix while its spectrum is preserved up to
some known set. It is then possible to estimate the spectrum of the original
matrix by considering Gershgorin-type estimates associated with the reduced
matrix. The main result of this paper is that eigenvalue estimates associated
with Gershgorin, Brauer, Brualdi, and Varga improve as the matrix size is
reduced. Moreover, given that such estimates improve with each successive
reduction, it is also possible to estimate the eigenvalues of a matrix with
increasing accuracy by repeated use of this process.

systematic effects are under control. The intrinsic alignment of galaxies is
expected to severely bias parameter estimates if not taken into account. We
explore the potential of a joint analysis of tomographic galaxy ellipticity,
galaxy number density, and ellipticity-number density cross-correlations to
simultaneously constrain cosmology and self-calibrate unknown intrinsic
alignment and galaxy bias contributions. We treat intrinsic alignments and
galaxy biasing as free functions of scale and redshift and marginalise over the
resulting parameter sets. Constraints on cosmology are calculated by combining
the likelihoods from all two-point correlations between galaxy ellipticity and
galaxy number density. The information required for these calculations is
already available in a standard cosmic shear dataset. We include contributions
to these functions from cosmic shear, intrinsic alignments, galaxy clustering
and magnification effects. In a Fisher matrix analysis we compare our
constraints with those from cosmic shear alone in the absence of intrinsic
alignments. For a potential future large area survey, such as Euclid, the extra
information from the additional correlation functions can make up for the
additional free parameters in the intrinsic alignment and galaxy bias terms,
depending on the flexibility in the models. For example, the Dark Energy Task
Force figure of merit is recovered even when more than 100 free parameters are
marginalised over. We find that the redshift quality requirements are similar
to those calculated in the absence of intrinsic alignments.

predicted how the time delay between the bright pair of images in a ""fold"" lens

the proportionality constant increases with the quadrupole moment of the lens
potential, and depends only weakly on the position of the source along the
caustic. We use Monte Carlo simulations to determine the range of time delays
that can be produced by realistic smooth lens models consisting of isothermal
ellipsoid galaxies with tidal shear. We can then identify outliers as ""time
delay anomalies"". We find evidence for anomalies in close image pairs in the
cusp lenses RX J1131$-$1231 and B1422+231. The anomalies in RX J1131$-$1231
provide strong evidence for substructure in the lens potential, while at this
point the apparent anomalies in B1422+231 mainly indicate that the time delay
measurements need to be improved. We also find evidence for time delay
anomalies in larger-separation image pairs in the fold lenses, B1608+656 and
WFI 2033$-$4723, and the cusp lens RX J0911+0551. We suggest that these
anomalies are caused by some combination of substructure and a complex lens
environment. Finally, to assist future monitoring campaigns we use our smooth

Coronagraphs could be the solution, but their performance in space is limited

solutions have been suggested for tackling this speckle noise. Differential
imaging techniques substract a reference image to the coronagraphic residue in
a post-processing imaging. Other techniques attempt to actively correct
wavefront errors using a deformable mirror. In that case, wavefront aberrations
have to be measured in the science image to extremely high accuracy. We propose
the self-coherent camera sequentially used as a focal-plane wavefront sensor
for active correction and differential imaging. For both uses, stellar speckles
are spatially encoded in the science image so that differential aberrations are
strongly minimized. The encoding is based on the principle of light incoherence
between the hosting star and its environment. In this paper, we first discuss
one intrinsic limitation of deformable mirrors. Then, several parameters of the
self-coherent camera are studied in detail. We also propose an easy and robust
design to associate the self-coherent camera with a coronagraph that uses a
Lyot stop. Finally, we discuss the case of the association with a four-quadrant
phase mask and numerically demonstrate that such a device enables the detection
of Earth-like planets under realistic conditions. The parametric study of the

strongly influenced by metallicity. The second parameter phenomenon
acknowledges that metallicity alone is not enough to describe the HB morphology
of all GCs. In particular, the outer Galactic halo contains GCs with redder HBs
at a given metallicity than are found inside the Solar circle. Thus, at least a
second parameter is required to characterize HB morphology. Here we analyze the
median color difference between the HB and the red giant branch (RGB), d(V-I),
measured from HST ACS photometry of 60 GCs within ~20 kpc of the Galactic
Center. Analysis of this homogeneous data set reveals that, after the influence
of metallicity has been removed, the correlation between d(V-I) and age is
stronger than that of any other parameter considered. Expanding the sample to
include HST photometry of the 6 most distant Galactic GCs lends additional
support to the correlation between d(V-I) and age. This result is robust with
respect to the adopted metallicity scale and the method of age determination,
but must bear the caveat that high quality, detailed abundance information is
not available for a significant fraction of the sample. When a subset of GCs
with similar metallicities and ages are considered, a correlation between
d(V-I) and central luminosity density is exposed. With respect to the existence
of GCs with anomalously red HBs at a given metallicity, we conclude that age is
the second parameter and central density is most likely the third. Important
problems related to HB morphology in GCs, notably multi-modal distributions and
faint blue tails, remain to be explained. (Abridged)

robust stellar masses with accurate error estimates. We apply this code to
deep, high-resolution HST imaging and determine stellar masses with typical
statistical errors of 0.1 dex; we find that these stellar masses are unbiased
compared to estimates obtained using SDSS photometry, provided that informative
priors are used. The stellar masses range from 10^10.5 to 10^11.8 M$_\odot$ and
the typical stellar mass fraction within the Einstein radius is 0.4, assuming a
Chabrier IMF. The ensemble properties of the SLACS lens galaxies, e.g. stellar
masses and projected ellipticities, appear to be indistinguishable from other
SDSS galaxies with similar stellar velocity dispersions. This further supports
that SLACS lenses are representative of the overall population of massive
early-type galaxies with M* >~ 10^11 M$_\odot$, and are therefore an ideal
dataset to investigate the kpc-scale distribution of luminous and dark matter

near-infrared, mid-infrared, and even sub-millimetre wavelengths has been
considerable. From the early days of single-detector photometers, through the
development of 2-D arrays and complex multi-mode imager-spectrometers, to the
present-day large-format imager WFCAM, UKIRT has offered the international
community access to some of the world's most innovating, competitive, and
versatile instrumentation possible. Suffice to say, UKIRT users have made the
most of these instruments! In this article I try to give a taste of the variety
of star formation research that has come to pass at UKIRT (with apologies to
those whose important work I fail to mention).

observed simultaneously with an angular resolution of ~0.5 mas (~0.2 AU for

through two 19-epoch animated movies spanning 21 months (2001 March 19 to 2002
December 10). These movies provide the most detailed view to date of the
dynamics and temporal evolution of molecular material within ~20-100 AU of a
massive (~>8M_sun) YSO. The bulk of the SiO masers surrounding Source I lie in
an X-shaped locus; emission in the South/East arms is predominantly blueshifted
and in the North and West is predominantly redshifted. In addition, bridges of
intermediate-velocity emission connect the red and blue sides of the emission
distribution. We have measured proper motions of >1000 maser features and find
a combination of radially outward migrations along the four arms and motions
tangent to the bridges. We interpret the SiO masers as arising from a
wide-angle bipolar wind emanating from a rotating, edge-on disk. The detection
of maser features along extended, curved filaments suggests that magnetic
fields may play a role in launching and/or shaping the wind. Our observations
appear to support a picture in which stars with M ~>8 M_sun form via
disk-mediated accretion. However, we cannot rule out that the Source I disk may
have been formed or altered following a close encounter. (Abridged).

follows field lines, so magnetic fields strongly shape the cluster's thermal
history; that some have not since cooled and collapsed is a mystery. In a
seemingly unrelated puzzle, recent observations of Virgo cluster spiral
galaxies imply ridges of strong, coherent magnetic fields offset from their
centre. Here we demonstrate, using three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical
simulations, that such ridges are easily explained by galaxies sweeping up
field lines as they orbit inside the cluster. This magnetic drape is then lit
up with cosmic rays from the galaxies' stars, generating coherent polarized
emission at the galaxies' leading edges. This immediately presents a technique
for probing local orientations and characteristic length scales of cluster
magnetic fields. The first application of this technique, mapping the field of
the Virgo cluster, gives a startling result: outside a central region, the
magnetic field is preferentially oriented radially as predicted by the
magnetothermal instability. Our results strongly suggest a mechanism for
maintaining some clusters in a 'non-cooling-core' state.

Weyl invariance manifest, to include interacting theories, fermions and
supersymmetric theories. The results produce mass terms coinciding with the
standard ones for universes that are Einstein, but are novel in general
backgrounds. They are generalizations of the gravitational couplings of a
conformally improved scalar to fields with general scaling and tensor
properties. The couplings we find are more general than just trivial ones
following from the conformal compensating mechanisms. In particular, in the
setting where a scale gauge field (or dilaton) is included, masses correspond
to Weyl weights of fields organized in ``tractor'' multiplets.
Breitenlohner--Freedman bounds follow directly from reality of these weights.
Moreover, massive, massless and partially massless theories are handled in a
uniform framework. Also, bona fide Weyl invariant theories (invariant without
coupling to scale) can be directly derived in this approach. The results are
based on the tractor calculus approach to conformal geometry, in particular we
show how to handle fermi fields, supersymmetry and Killing spinors using
tractor techniques. Another useful consequence of the construction is that it
automatically produces the (anti) de Sitter theories obtained by log-radial
reduction of Minkowski theories in one higher dimension. Theories presented in
detail include interacting scalars, spinors, Rarita--Schwinger fields, and the
interacting Wess--Zumino model.

GLIMPSE-C01. No point-like source falls within the extended emission which has
an X-ray luminosity L_X =10^{32} ergs/s and a physical size of 0.1 pc at the
inferred distance to the cluster. These X-ray properties are consistent with
the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) of an unseen pulsar located within the 95-percent
confidence error contour of unidentified Fermi gamma-ray source 0FGL
J1848.6-0138. However, we cannot exclude an alternative interpretation that
postulates X-ray emission associated with a bow shock produced from the
interaction of the globular cluster and interstellar gas in the Galactic plane.
Analysis of the X-ray data reveals that `The Stem' is most significant in the
2-5 keV band, which suggests that the emission may be dominated by non-thermal
bremsstrahlung from suprathermal electrons at the bow shock. If the bow shock
interpretation is correct, these observations would provide compelling evidence
that GLIMPSE-C01 is shedding its intracluster gas during a galactic passage.
Such a direct detection of gas stripping would help clarify a crucial step in
the evolutionary history of globular clusters. Intriguingly, the data may also
accommodate a new type of X-ray source.

provide a single estimate but samples from the joint posterior of the
power-spectrum and density field conditional on a set of observations. This
enables us to calculate any desired statistical summary, in particular we are
able to provide joint uncertainty estimates. We apply our method to mock
catalogs, with highly structured observational masks and selection functions,
in order to demonstrate its ability to reconstruct the power-spectrum from real
data sets, while fully accounting for any mask induced mode coupling.

  The final section looks at periodicity results for the spectra of monadic

simplification of the proofs in the 2003 foundational paper on spectra by

three dimensional large scale structure inference. We employ a Hamiltonian
Monte Carlo (HMC) sampler to obtain samples from a multivariate highly
non-Gaussian lognormal Poissonian density posterior given a set of
observations. The HMC allows us to take into account the nonlinear relations
between the observations and the underlying density field which we seek to
recover. As the HMC provides a sampled representation of the density posterior
any desired statistical summary, such as the mean, mode or variance, can be
calculated from the set of samples. Further, it permits us to seamlessly
propagate non-Gaussian uncertainty information to any final quantity inferred
from the set of samples. The developed method is extensively tested in a
variety of test scenarios, taking into account a highly structured survey
geometry and selection effects. Tests with a mock galaxy catalog based on the
millennium run show that the method is able to recover the filamentary
structure of the nonlinear density field. The results further demonstrate the
feasibility of non-Gaussian sampling in high dimensional spaces, as required
for precision nonlinear large scale structure inference. The HMC is a flexible
and efficient method, which permits for simple extension and incorporation of
additional observational constraints. Thus, the method presented here provides
an efficient and flexible basis for future high precision large scale structure
inference.

inequalities. This simple theorem, previously noted but published only
relatively recently by Masanes, Acin and Gisin, has fundamental implications
not entirely appreciated. Firstly, nothing can be concluded about the
ontological assumptions of locality or determinism independently of each other
-- it is possible to reproduce quantum mechanics with deterministic models that
violate locality as well as indeterministic models that satisfy locality. On
the other hand, the operational assumption of signal locality is an empirically
testable (and well-tested) consequence of relativity. Thus Bell inequality
violations imply that we can trust that some events are fundamentally
\emph{unpredictable}, even if we cannot trust that they are indeterministic.

postulates of quantum mechanics. It also sheds a new light on an early stage of

and XTE J1807-294 during quiescence in order to look for the presence of a
variable counterpart. If suitable candidates were found, we also carried out
optical spectroscopy. We present here the first multi-band (VR) detection of
the optical counterpart of XTE J1814-338 in quiescence together with its
optical spectrum. The optical light curve shows variability in both bands
consistent with a sinusoidal modulation at the known 4.3 hr orbital period and
presents a puzzling decrease of the V-band flux around superior conjunction
that may be interpreted as a partial eclipse. The marginal detection of the
very faint counterpart of XTE J0929-314 and deep upper limits for the
optical/NIR counterpart of XTE J1807-294 are also reported. We also briefly
discuss the results reported in the literature for the optical/NIR counterpart
of XTE J1751-305. Our findings are consistent with AMXPs being systems
containing an old, weakly magnetized neutron star, reactivated as a millisecond
radio pulsar during quiescence which irradiates the low-mass companion star.
The absence of type I X-ray bursts and of hydrogen and helium lines in outburst
spectra of ultracompact (P_orb < 1 hr) AMXPs suggests that the companion stars
are likely evolved dwarf stars.

Furthermore, the results from the model are in good agreement with the

Interestingly, it is found that there are many [OII] emitters even in the

cluster members as well as their star formation rates and equivalent widths
stay almost constant with decreasing cluster-centric distance up to the cluster
core. Unlike clusters at lower redshifts (z<1) where star formation activity is
mostly quenched in their central regions, this higher redshift 2215 cluster
shows its high star formation activity even at its centre, suggesting that we
are beginning to enter the formation epoch of some galaxies in the cluster core
eventually. Moreover, we find a deficit of galaxies on the red sequence at
magnitudes fainter than ~M*+0.5 on the colour-magnitude diagram. This break
magnitude is brighter than that of lower redshift clusters, and it is likely
that we are seeing the formation phase of more massive red galaxies in the
cluster core at z~1. These results may indicate inside-out and down-sizing
propagation of star formation activity in the course of cluster evolution.

particles below a certain energy ($E_{Cut}$) are discarded from the simulation.
In this article we study in detail the influence that this cut has on the total
energy deposited in the atmosphere by the particle cascade in AIRES
simulations. The energy deposit is directly related to the emission of
fluorescence light and is critical for the accurate simulation of shower
signals in fluorescence detectors. Not correcting for the discarded particles
introduces a bias on several shower observables related to the energy deposit
that can range from 3 to 30% or more depending on the $E_{Cut}$ value used. A
prescription for the correct treatment of these particles is proposed, and the
resulting corrections to the total energy deposit are addressed, including a
new universal parametrization of the mean energy deposit per particle. The low
energy cut is introduced in the simulations to reduce the required CPU time per
shower at the expense of simulation accuracy. We find that a 0.4 MeV cut for
electrons and 0.9 MeV cut for gammas is an adequate compromise, and that the
proposed prescription is capablable of removing the bias introduced by this
cut. The prescription is independent of the energy cut value and can be used to
correct and compare simulations made with different energy cuts.

always less than the primary energy and a correction needs to be applied. This
correction, usually referred to as the ""missing energy"", can only be estimated
using Monte Carlo simulations.
  In this article we study in detail the influence that discarding low energy

invisible energy,an important bias on the missing energy is introduced that can
reach 30% or more depending on the low energy cut value.

congestion at a very limited number of nodes in very large networks. It is
argued that this phenomenon occurs as a combination of the negative curvature
property of the network together with minimum length routing. More
specifically, it is shown that, in a large n-dimensional hyperbolic ball B of
radius R viewed as a roughly similar model of a Gromov hyperbolic network, the
proportion of traffic paths transiting through a small ball near the center is
independent of the radius R whereas, in a Euclidean ball, the same proportion
scales as 1/R^{n-1}. This discrepancy persists for the traffic load, which at
the center of the hyperbolic ball scales as the square of the volume, whereas
the same traffic load scales as the volume to the power (n+1)/n in the
Euclidean ball. This provides a theoretical justification of the experimental
exponent discrepancy observed by Narayan and Saniee between traffic loads in
Gromov-hyperbolic networks from the Rocketfuel data base and synthetic
Euclidean lattice networks. It is further conjectured that for networks that do

demonstrate that partially-open carbon nanotubes (CNTs) observed in recent
experiments have rich electronic and magnetic properties which depend on the
degree of the opening. A partially-open armchair CNT is converted from a metal
to a semiconductor, and then to a spin-polarized semiconductor by increasing
the length of the opening on the wall. Spin-polarized states become
increasingly more stable than nonmagnetic states as the length of the opening
is further increased. In addition, external electric fields or chemical
modifications are usable to control the electronic and magnetic properties of
the system. We show that half-metallicity may be achieved and the spin current
may be controlled by external electric fields or by asymmetric
functionalization of the edges of the opening. Our findings suggest that
partially-open CNTs may offer unique opportunities for the future development
of nanoscale electronics and spintronics.

Throughout the calculation, emphasis is laid on the establishment of a valid

operator product expansion converges and the presumed ground state pole
dominates the sum rules. Such a Borel window is achieved by constructing the
sum rules from the difference of two independent correlators and by calculating
the operator product expansion up to dimension 14. Furthermore, we discuss the
possibility of the contamination of the sum rules by possible KN scattering
states. As a result, we conclude that the 0,3/2^+ state seems to be the most

detection problems is considered when the pre-change and post-change
distributions are not known exactly but belong to known uncertainty classes of
distributions. For uncertainty classes that satisfy a specific condition, it is
shown that one can identify least favorable distributions (LFDs) from the
uncertainty classes, such that the detection rule designed for the LFDs is
optimal for the robust problem in a minimax sense. The condition is similar to
that required for the identification of LFDs for the robust hypothesis testing
problem originally studied by Huber. An upper bound on the delay incurred by
the robust test is also obtained in the asymptotic setting under the Lorden
criterion of optimality. This bound quantifies the delay penalty incurred to
guarantee robustness. When the LFDs can be identified, the proposed test is
easier to implement than the CUSUM test based on the Generalized Likelihood
Ratio (GLR) statistic which is a popular approach for such robust change
detection problems. The proposed test is also shown to give better performance
than the GLR test in simulations for some parameter values.

physical layer (PHY) security of wireless transmission in the presence of
multiple eavesdroppers. While existing PHY security literature answered the
question ``what are the link-level secrecy rate gains from cooperation?'', this
paper attempts to answer the question of ``how to achieve those gains in a
practical decentralized wireless network and in the presence of a cost for
information exchange?''. For this purpose, we model the PHY security
cooperation problem as a coalitional game with non-transferable utility and
propose a distributed algorithm for coalition formation. Through the proposed
algorithm, the wireless users can cooperate and self-organize into disjoint
independent coalitions, while maximizing their secrecy rate taking into account
the security costs during information exchange. We analyze the resulting
coalitional structures for both decode-and-forward and amplify-and-forward
cooperation and study how the users can adapt the network topology to
environmental changes such as mobility. Through simulations, we assess the
performance of the proposed algorithm and show that, by coalition formation
using decode-and-forward, the average secrecy rate per user is increased of up
to 25.3 % and 24.4 % (for a network with 45 users) relative to the
non-cooperative and amplify-and-forward cases, respectively.

spectral analysis has been performed separately for the data of the whole disk,
northern and southern hemispheres of the Sun. Several significant midrange
periodicities ($\sim$175, 133, 113, 104, 84, 63 days) are detected in sunspot
activity. Most of the periodicities in sunspot numbers generally agree with
those of sunspot areas during the solar cycle 23. The study reveals that the
periodic variations in the northern and southern hemispheres of the Sun show a
kind of asymmetrical behavior. Periodicities of $\sim$175 days and $\sim$133
days are highly significant in the sunspot data of northern hemisphere showing
consistency with the findings of Lean (1990) during solar cycles 12-21. On the
other hand, southern hemisphere shows a strong periodicity of about 85 days in
terms of sunspot activity. The analysis of solar flare index data of the same
time interval does not show any significant peak. The different periodic
behavior of sunspot and flare activity can be understood in the light of
hypothesis proposed by Ballester et al. (2002), which suggests that during
cycle 23, the periodic emergence of magnetic flux partly takes place away from
developed sunspot groups and hence may not necessarily increase the magnetic
complexity of sunspot groups that leads to the generation of flares.

variation of the net circular polarization (NCP) in sunspot penumbrae at
different heliocentric angles for two different spectral lines. The theoretical
net circular polarization fits the observations as satisfactorily as penumbral
models based on flux-tubes. The reason for this is that the effect of
convective motions on the NCP is very small compared to the effect of the
Evershed flow. In addition, the NCP generated by convective upflows cancels out
the NCP generated by the downflows. We have also found that, in order to fit
the observed NCP, the strength of the magnetic field inside penumbral filaments
must be very close to 1000 G. In particular, field-free or weak-field filaments
fail to reproduce both the correct sign of the net circular polarization, as

transport theories assumed the Brownian motion as the underlying energy
transporting mechanism, but however, it should be noticed that in fact this

result of nonlinear interactions between oppositely directed wavepackets of
Elsasser fields; (ii) these oppositely directed wavepackets do not exchange
energy, but contribute only to changing each other's spatial structures. I

explore the fundamental departures necessitated by the anisotropic nature of

high-quality approximations to ground states. The energies obtained from
extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit smoothly approach the ground-state

approximately with ~N^{-4/5}. The possibility of ~N^{-2/3} corrections, found
previously for Bethe lattices with a bimodal +-J bond distribution and also for

of very specific higher-order terms. Instance-to-instance fluctuations in the

point our usual, well-worn assumption of homogeneity associated to the use of
perturbation theory begins to compromise the accuracy of our models. It is now
a widely accepted fact that the effect of the inhomogeneities observed in the
Universe cannot be ignored when one wants to construct an accurate cosmological
model. Well-established physics can explain several of the observed phenomena
without introducing highly speculative elements, like dark matter, dark energy,
exponential expansion at densities never attained in any experiment (i.e.
inflation), and the like. Two main classes of methods are currently used to
deal with these issues. Averaging, sometimes linked to fitting procedures a la
Stoegger and Ellis, provide us with one promising way of solving the problem.
Another approach is the use of exact inhomogeneous solutions of General
Relativity. This will be developed here.

in the case where $\mu_1 (x)$ is of order $x^{-\beta}$ for some $\beta \in
(0,1)$. The bounds are of order $t^{1/(1+\beta)}$, so the process is
super-diffusive but sub-ballistic (has zero speed). We make minimal assumptions
on the moments of the increments of the process (finiteness of
$(2+2\beta+\varepsilon)$-moments for our main results, so 4th moments certainly
suffice) and do not assume that the process is time-homogeneous or Markovian.
In the case where $x^\beta \mu_1 (x)$ has a finite positive limit, our results
imply a strong law of large numbers, which strengthens and generalizes earlier
results of Lamperti and Voit. We prove an accompanying central limit theorem,
which appears to be new even in the case of a nearest-neighbour random walk,

Lamperti. We also prove transience of the process under weaker conditions than
those that we have previously seen in the literature. Most of our results also

degeneracies with the cosmological parameters. Gravitational effects can play
an important role. Even small inhomogeneity clouds our ability to say something
definite about dark energy. I discuss how the averaging problem confuses our
potential understanding of dark energy by considering the backreaction from
density perturbations to second-order in the concordance model: this effect

parameter, and could be significantly higher. Large Hubble-scale inhomogeneity

identify the underlying theory, its fundamental parameters, and the masses of
SUSY particles. We followed here the approach to reconstruct the decay chains
in SUSY events under the assumption of common intermediate masses. These masses
cannot be extracted from each event because of the unmeasured LSP momenta in
case of R-parity conservation. But an ensemble of events can be
over-constrained, if the decay chains are long enough, such that enough mass
constraints are available. Here, we present a new method combining a) a SUSY
mass scan, b) a kinematic fitting based on a genetic algorithm for decay chain
reconstruction, and c) the usage of angular decay information to suppress the
background from other SUSY processes. Taking into account the full
combinatorial background and experimental resolutions in the most difficult
case of the fully hadronic decay mode, we demonstrate, within one SUSY
scenario, that this method can be used to derive a probability map of the SUSY
parameter space.

  The second paper: recent letter by Maccone presents a solution based on the
existing laws of quantum mechanics to the arrow-of-time dilemma. He argues that
all phenomena in which the entropy decreases must not leave any information (in
the observer's memory) of their having occurred because the observer is a part
of the whole system. Maccone concludes that quantum mechanics is necessary to
his argument, which he believes does not otherwise work in classical mechanics.
This Comment consists of four parts. We discuss the basic problems in the first
part. This Comment and the previously published Comment by Jennings and Rudolph
describes flaws in Maccone's arguments. However, the main argument (erasure of
the observer's memory), which was previously formulated in our work and was
repeated by Maccone, is correct under the conditions described in this Comment.
Moreover, this argument can be used to resolve a reduction paradox (the
Schrodinger's Cat paradox) in quantum mechanics. This use is demonstrated in
the second part. In the third part, the synchronisation (decoherence) of time
arrows is discussed. In the fourth part, the synchronisation (decoherence) of
time arrows in quantum gravity is considered.

used six year (2003-2009, with a total exposure of about 4 Ms) of publicly
available data of the SPI telescope on-board of the INTEGRAL observatory,
folded with the pulsar time solution derived from the Jodrell Bank Crab Pulsar
Monthly Ephemeris. We found that the main pulse in the hard X-ray 20-100 keV
energy band is leading the radio one by $8.18\pm0.46$ milliperiods in phase, or
$275\pm15 \mu s$ in time. Quoted errors represent only statistical
uncertainties.Our systematic error is estimated to be $\sim 40 \mu s$ and is
mainly caused by the radio measurement uncertainties. In hard X-rays, the
average distance between the main pulse and interpulse on the phase plane is
$0.3989\pm0.0009$. To compare our findings in hard X-rays with the soft 2-20
keV X-ray band, we have used data of quasi-simultaneous Crab observations with
the PCA monitor on-board the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) mission. The
time lag and the pulses separation values measured in the 3-20 keV band are
$0.00933\pm0.00016$ (corresponding to $310\pm6 \mu s$) and $0.40016\pm0.00028$
parts of the cycle, respectively. While the pulse separation values measured in
soft X-rays and hard X-rays agree, the time lags are statistically different.
Additional analysis show that the delay between the radio and X-ray signals
varies with energy in the 2 - 300 keV energy range. We explain such a behaviour
as due to the superposition of two independent components responsible for the
Crab pulsed emission in this energy band.

data from 1999 and 2007 associated to a photometric analysis, the aim of this
work is to provide a deep spectroscopic description and a new set of parameters
for this unclassified southern B[e] star and its interstellar extinction.
Methods: From our high-resolution optical spectroscopic data separated by 8
years, we perform a detailed spectral description, presenting the variations
seen and discussing their possible origin. We derive the interstellar
extinction to HD 50138 by taking the influences of the circumstellar matter in
the form of dust and an ionized disk into account. Based on photometric data
from the literature and the new Hipparcos distance, we obtain a revised set of
parameters for HD 50138. Results: Because of the spectral changes, we
tentatively suggest that a new shell phase could have taken place prior to our
observations in 2007. We find a color excess value of E(B-V) = 0.08 mag, and
from the photometric analysis, we suggest that HD 50138 is a B6-7 III-V star. A

theory of the Casimir effect in planar cavities, we complement our previous
discussion of the ordinary Casimir force on and the Casimir stress in a metal
(plasma) slab in a planar cavity. We demonstrate strong dependence of the
Casimir stress in a thin slab on properties of the bounding medium in the
symmetric Lifshitz configuration. Contrary to this, the stress in a thick slab
gradually becomes insensitive on external boundary conditions. We also consider
the position dependence of the Casimir force on and stress in a thin metal slab
in a planar cavity. Whereas the force per unit area on the slab strongly
increases when it approaches a mirror the stress in the slab decreases and
eventually changes the sign. Generally, the stress decreases with the cavity
width and decreasing reflectivity of the mirrors.

from fission breeder and fusion reactors are analyzed in this report.
  The publicly available data from past experimental breeder reactors indicate
that a large number of unsolved technological problems exist and that the
amount of ""created"" fissile material, either from the U238 --> Pu239 or from
the Th232 --> U233 cycle, is still far below the breeder requirements and
optimistic theoretical expectations. Thus huge efforts, including many basic
research questions with an uncertain outcome, are needed before a large
commercial breeder prototype can be designed. Even if such efforts are
undertaken by the technologically most advanced countries, it will take several
decades before such a prototype can be constructed. We conclude therefore, that
ideas about near-future commercial fission breeder reactors are nothing but
wishful thinking.
  We further conclude that, no matter how far into the future we may look,
nuclear fusion as an energy source is even less probable than large-scale
breeder reactors, for the accumulated knowledge on this subject is already
sufficient to say that commercial fusion power will never become a reality.

a new numerical scheme arising from the combined use of subgrid scale (SGS)

suitable for the study of turbulent flows in strongly clumped media. In this
contribution, the main features of FEARLESS are briefly outlined. We then
summarize the main results of FEARLESS cosmological simulations of galaxy
cluster evolution. In clusters, the production of turbulence is closely
correlated with merger events; for minor mergers, we find that turbulent
dissipation affects the cluster energy budget only locally. The level of
entropy in the cluster core is enhanced in FEARLESS simulations, in accord with
a better modeling of the unresolved flow, and with its feedback on the resolved
mixing in the ICM.

source normalized impact per paper (SNIP). It measures a journal's contextual
citation impact, taking into account characteristics of its properly defined
subject field, especially the frequency at which authors cite other papers in
their reference lists, the rapidity of maturing of citation impact, and the
extent to which a database used for the assessment covers the field's
literature. It further develops Eugene Garfield's notions of a field's
'citation potential' defined as the average length of references lists in a
field and determining the probability of being cited, and the need in fair
performance assessments to correct for differences between subject fields. A
journal's subject field is defined as the set of papers citing that journal.
SNIP is defined as the ratio of the journal's citation count per paper and the
citation potential in its subject field. It aims to allow direct comparison of
sources in different subject fields. Citation potential is shown to vary not
only between journal subject categories - groupings of journals sharing a
research field - or disciplines (e.g., journals in mathematics, engineering and
social sciences tend to have lower values than titles in life sciences), but
also between journals within the same subject category. For instance, basic
journals tend to show higher citation potentials than applied or clinical
journals, and journals covering emerging topics higher than periodicals in
classical subjects or more general journals. SNIP corrects for such
differences. Its strengths and limitations are critically discussed, and
suggestions are made for further research. All empirical results are derived
from Elsevier's Scopus.

absence (pure states) and in the presence (mixed states) of thermal noise,
using the Glauber representation of coherent laser radiation. The objective is
to find optimal (or suboptimal) measurement operators and to evaluate the
corresponding error probability. For PPM, the correct formulation of quantum
states is given by the tensorial product of m identical Hilbert spaces, where m
is the PPM order. The presence of mixed states, due to thermal noise, generates
an optimization problem involving matrices of huge dimensions, which already
for 4-PPM, are of the order of ten thousand. To overcome this computational
complexity, the currently available methods of quantum detection, which are
based on explicit results, convex linear programming and square root
measurement, are compared to find the computationally less expensive one. In
this paper a fundamental role is played by the geometrically uniform symmetry
of the quantum PPM format. The evaluation of error probability confirms the
vast superiority of the quantum detection over its classical counterpart.

RCW82 and RCW120. We identify the ionizing stars of each region: they are early
to late O stars, close to the main sequence. We derive their stellar and wind
properties using atmosphere models computed with the code CMFGEN. The cluster
ionizing RCW~79 formed 2.3+/-0.5 Myr ago. Similar ages are estimated, albeit
with a larger uncertainty, for the ionizing stars of the other two regions. In
RCW79 the mechanical wind luminosity represents only 0.1% of the ionizing
luminosity, questioning the influence of stellar winds on the dynamics of the
the HII region. The young stellar objects show four main types of spectral
features: H2 emission, Br gamma emission, CO bandheads emission and CO
bandheads absorption. These features are typical of young stellar objects
surrounded by disks and/or envelopes. The radial velocities of most YSOs are
consistent with that of the ionized gas, firmly establishing that star
formation is taking place on the borders of the HII regions. Outflows are
detected in a few YSOs. All YSOs have moderate to strong near-IR excess. In the
[24] versus K-[24] diagram, the majority of the sources dominated by H2
emission lines stand out as redder and brighter than the rest of the YSOs.
Their H2 emission is mainly due to shocks. We tentatively propose that they
represent an earlier phase of evolution compared to sources dominated by Br
gamma and CO bandheads. We suggest that they still possess a dense envelope in
which jets or winds create shocks. The other YSOs have partly lost their
envelopes and show signatures of accretion disks.
