renormalization group arguments in the astrophysical domain and show that, for
the most natural interpretation of the renormalization group scale parameter, a
gravitational coupling parameter $G$ varying $10^{-7}$ of its value across a
galaxy (which is roughly a variation of $10^{-12}$ per light-year) is
sufficient to generate galaxy rotation curves in agreement with the
observations. The quality of the resulting fit is similar to the Isothermal
profile quality once both the shape of the rotation curve and the mass-to-light
ratios are considered for evaluation. In order to perform the analysis, we use
recent high quality data from nine regular disk galaxies. For the sake of
comparison, the same set of data is modeled also for the Modified Newtonian
Dynamics (MOND) and for the recently proposed Scalar Tensor Vector Gravity
(STVG). At face value, the model based on quantum corrections clearly leads to
better fits than these two alternative theories.

importance of higher-order (post-Newtonian) corrections to tidal effects, even

significantly} increase the ``effective tidal polarizability'' of neutron
stars. We compare the EOB predictions to some recently advocated, nonresummed,
post-Newtonian based (``Taylor-T4'') description of the phasing of inspiralling

needed for new physics searches, a high energy version including an off-axis

multiple outputs. This has been motivated partly by frameworks like multitask
learning, multisensor networks or structured output data. From a Gaussian
processes perspective, the problem reduces to specifying an appropriate
covariance function that, whilst being positive semi-definite, captures the
dependencies between all the data points and across all the outputs. One
approach to account for non-trivial correlations between outputs employs
convolution processes. Under a latent function interpretation of the
convolution transform we establish dependencies between output variables. The
main drawbacks of this approach are the associated computational and storage
demands. In this paper we address these issues. We present different sparse
approximations for dependent output Gaussian processes constructed through the
convolution formalism. We exploit the conditional independencies present
naturally in the model. This leads to a form of the covariance similar in
spirit to the so called PITC and FITC approximations for a single output. We
show experimental results with synthetic and real data, in particular, we show
results in pollution prediction, school exams score prediction and gene

imaging before the tests (pQCT) in order to indentify two microstructural
properties: Bone Volume / Total Volume ? BV/TV ? and Trabeculae Thickness ?
Tb.Th. The behavior of bovine cancellous bone under compression exhibits a
foam-type behavior over the whole range of strain rates explored in this study.
The results show that for the quasi-static tests only the stresses are
correlated with BV/TV. For the unconfined dynamic tests, the yield stress is
correlated to BV/TV and the plateau stress to BV/TV and Tb.Th. For the confined
tests, only the plateau stress is correlated to BV/TV and Tb.Th. The effect of
strain rate is an increase of the yield stress and the plateau stress. The
confinement has an effect on the measured values of compression stresses that
confirms the importance of marrow flow in the overall behavior.

characterised in terms of an optimal exercise boundary which, in contrast to
the case when there are no dividends, may no longer be monotone. In this paper
we prove that when the dividend function is positive and concave, then the
boundary is non-increasing in a left-hand neighbourhood of $t_d$, and tends to
$0$ as time tends to $t_d^-$ with a speed that we can characterize. When the
dividend function is linear in a neighbourhood of zero, then we show continuity

ambient conditions of the parent cloud. We present a series of 2D and 3D
simulations of fragmentation of molecular clouds in starburst regions as well
as clouds under conditions in dwarf galaxies, leading to the formation of
protostellar cores. We explore in particular the metallicity dependence of
molecular cloud fragmentation and the possible variations in the dense core
mass function, as the expression of a multi-phase ISM, due to dynamic and
thermodynamic effects in starburst and metal-poor environments. To study the
level of fragmentation during the collapse, the adaptive mesh refinement code
FLASH is used. With this code, including self-gravity, thermal balance,
turbulence and shocks, collapse is simulated with four different metallicity
dependent cooling functions. Turbulent and rotational energies are considered
as well. During the simulations, number densities of 10^8-10^9 cm^-3 are
reached. The influences of dust and cosmic ray heating are investigated and a
comparison to isothermal cases is made. The presented results indicate that
fragmentation increases with metallicity, while cosmic ray and gas-grain
collisional heating counteract this. We also find that modest rotation and
turbulence can impact the cloud evolution as far as fragmentation is concerned.
In this light, we conclude that radiative feedback, in starburst regions, will
inhibit fragmentation, while low-metallicity dwarfs also should enjoy a star
formation mode in which fragmentation is suppressed.

structure of the local observable quantities alone, at least for purely massive
theories; but to deal with the Principle of Local Gauge Invariance is still a
problem in this frame. This problem emerges also if one attempts to figure out
the fate of the Principle of Locality in theories describing the gravitational
forces between elementary particles as well. Spacetime should then acquire a
quantum structure at the Planck scale, and the Principle of Locality is lost.
It is a crucial open problem to unravel a replacement in such theories which is

graphs. The crux of the process is a clustering procedure called
prize-collecting clustering that breaks down the input instance into separate
subinstances which are easier to handle; moreover, the terminals in different
subinstances are far from each other. Each subinstance has a relatively
inexpensive Steiner tree connecting all its terminals, and the subinstances can
be solved (almost) separately. Another building block is a PTAS for Steiner
forest on graphs of bounded treewidth. Surprisingly, Steiner forest is NP-hard
even on graphs of treewidth 3. Therefore, our PTAS for bounded treewidth graph
needs a nontrivial combination of approximation arguments and dynamic
programming on the tree decomposition. We further show that Steiner forest can
be solved in polynomial time for series-parallel graphs (graphs of treewidth at
most two) by a novel combination of dynamic programming and minimum cut
computations, completing our thorough complexity study of Steiner forest in the

realistic parameters, the rate that at least one charge is transferred from the

strongly influenced by the Coulomb matrix elements. We find sequential and pair
transfer as well as a regime where both charges remain self-trapped. The
transfer rate reaches its maximum when the difference of the on-site and
inter-site Coulomb matrix element is equal to the reorganization energy which
is the case in a GC-GC dimer. Charge transfer is completely suppressed for two
excess electrons in AT-AT in an ohmic bath and replaced by damped coherent
electron-pair oscillations in a super-ohmic bath. A finite bond-bond

main difficulties for this unification is that between inflation and dark
matter one needs a successful reheating process and a long lasting period of
radiation. Therefore the amount of energy density in the inflaton-dark matter
field phi must be fine tune after reheating to give dark matter. Here we show
an alternative scheme in which the inflaton decays completely, disappearing
entirely from the spectrum. However, at low energies, before matter-radiation
equality, the same interaction term that leads to the inflaton decay,
regenerates phi. An essential feature is that the transition between the
intermediate radiation dominated to the dark matter phase is related to a
quantum generation of the scalar field \phi instead to purely classical
dynamics. Thanks to this quantum transition the inflation-dark matter
unification can take place naturally without fine tuning. The unification
scheme presented here has three parameters, the mass of the dark matter
particle m_o, the inflation parameter lambda and the coupling g for the
inflaton interaction. Phenomenology fixes the value for lambda and gives a
constraint between g and m_o, leaving only the mass of the dark matter particle
m_o as a free parameter. These same three parameters lambda, m_o, g are present
in models with inflation and a dark matter wimp particle but without
unification. Therefore our unification scheme does not increase the number of
parameters and it accomplishes the desired unification between inflaton and
dark matter for free.

contributes to the HFS of P states. A comparison of the obtained analytic

theoretically to show that it is different from that in single-bubble cases in

equation with an acoustic interaction term, we confirmed that the recently
reported suppression of cavitation inception due to the interaction of
non-identical bubbles can take place not only in liquid mercury but also in
water, and we found that a relatively large bubble can significantly decrease
the cavitation threshold pressure of a nearby small bubble. By examining in
detail the transition region where the dynamics of the suppressed bubble
changes drastically as the inter-bubble distance changes, we determined that
the explosive expansion of a bubble under negative pressure can be interrupted
and turn into collapse even though the far-field liquid pressure well exceeds
the bubble's threshold pressure. Numerical results suggest that the
interruption of expansion occurs when the bubble radius is exceeded by the
instantaneous unstable equilibrium radius of the bubble determined using the
total pressure acting on the bubble. When we extended the discussion to systems
of larger numbers of bubbles, we found that a larger number of bubbles have a
stronger suppression effect. The present findings would be useful in
understanding the complex behavior of cavitation bubbles in practical
applications where in general many cavitation nuclei exist and may interact

positive and negative pulses, but a theoretical model for single bubbles fails
to reproduce the negative ones. Using a nonlinear multibubble model we have
shown here that the negative pulses can be explained by considering the
interaction of microbubbles formed after the cavitation bubble has collapsed
and fragmented: Positive pulses produced at the collapse of the microbubbles
hit and impulsively compress neighboring microbubbles to generate reflected
pulses whose amplitudes are negative. Discussing the details of the noise

to excessive mass accretion rates contrary to observations. One of the key
proposals to offset radiative energy losses is thermal conduction from outer,
hotter layers of cool core clusters to their centers. However, conduction is
sensitive to magnetic field topology. In cool-core clusters the heat buoyancy
instability (HBI) leads to B-fields ordered preferentially in the direction
perpendicular to that of gravity, which significantly reduces the level of
conduction below the classical Spitzer-Braginskii value. However, the cluster
cool cores are rarely in perfect hydrostatic equilibrium. Sloshing motions due
to minor mergers, galaxy motions or AGN can significantly perturb the gas and
affect the level of thermal conduction. We perform 3D AMR MHD simulations of
the effect of turbulence on the properties of the anisotropic thermal
conduction in cool core clusters. We show that very weak subsonic motions, well
within observational constraints, can randomize the magnetic field and
significantly boost effective thermal conduction beyond the saturated values
expected in the pure unperturbed HBI case. We find that the turbulent motions
can essentially restore the conductive heat flow to the cool core to level
comparable to the theoretical maximum of 1/3 Spitzer for a highly tangled
field. Runs with radiative cooling show that the cooling catastrophe can be
averted and the cluster core stabilized. Above a critical Froude number, these
same turbulent motions also eliminate the tangential bias in the velocity and
magnetic field that is otherwise induced by the trapped g-modes. Our results
can be tested with future radio polarization measurements, and have
implications for efficient metal dispersal in clusters.

holes may be too small to power such clusters. However, Lauer et al. (2007)
argue that the black hole mass - bulge luminosity relationship is a better
predictor of black hole masses in high luminosity galaxies and that this
relationship predicts significantly higher masses in BCGs. They find slow
increase in the velocity dispersion with luminosity and a more rapid increase
in effective radii with luminosity seen in BCGs as opposed to less luminous
galaxies. Motivated by these results and the theoretical work of Boylan-Kolchin
et al. (2006) on isolated mergers, we perform high-resolution cosmological
simulations of dry mergers in a massive galaxy cluster identified in the
Millennium Run including both the dark matter halos and stellar bulges of
merging galaxies. We demonstrate that the BCG clearly evolves away from the
size-luminosity relation as defined by the smaller galaxies (i.e., the relation
bends) and we also see a bending in the luminosity-sigma relation. As black
hole mass is expected to be proportional to the mass and luminosity of the
stellar bulge of the BCGs (if they were formed in predominantly dissipationless
mergers), our findings are consistent with those of Lauer et al. (2007) on a
qualitative level and suggest that the black holes in BCGs may indeed be more
massive than predicted from the standard M-sigma relation.

logic programming language that supports the lambda-tree syntax approach to
representing and manipulating formal syntactic objects. Lambda Prolog achieves
its functionality by extending a Prolog-like language by using typed lambda
terms as data structures that it then manipulates via higher-order unification
and some new program-level abstraction mechanisms. These additional features
raise new implementation questions that must be adequately addressed for Lambda
Prolog to be an effective programming tool. We consider these questions here,
providing eventually a virtual machine and compilation based realization. A key
idea is the orientation of the computation model of Lambda Prolog around a
restricted version of higher-order unification with nice algorithmic properties
and appearing to encompass most interesting applications. Our virtual machine
embeds a treatment of this form of unification within the structure of the
Warren Abstract Machine that is used in traditional Prolog implementations.
Along the way, we treat various auxiliary issues such as the low-level
representation of lambda terms, the implementation of reduction on such terms
and the optimized processing of types in computation. We also develop an actual
implementation of Lambda Prolog called Teyjus Version 2. A characteristic of
this system is that it realizes an emulator for the virtual machine in the C
language a compiler in the OCaml language. We present a treatment of the
software issues that arise from this kind of mixing of languages within one
system and we discuss issues relevant to the portability of our virtual machine
emulator across arbitrary architectures. Finally, we assess the the efficacy of
our various design ideas through experiments carried out using the system.

(0.4 times virial radius). Both these quantities decrease gradually from the
center to peripheries by a factor of $\sim 2$, while the oxygen abundance tends
to be flat. The temperature within 12' ($\sim 430$ kpc) is $\sim 4$ keV, and
the 0.5--10 keV X-ray luminosity integrated up to 30' is $(2.9 \pm 0.1) \times
10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$, in agreement with previous XMM-Newton measurements.
Above this thermal emission, no significant excess was found either in the XIS
range below $\sim 1$ keV, or in the HXD-PIN range above $\sim 15$ keV. The
90%-confidence upper limit on the emission measure of an assumed 0.2 keV warm
gas is (3.7--7.5) $\times 10^{62}$ cm$^{-3}$ arcmin$^{-2}$, which is 3.7--7.6

upper limit on the 20--80 keV luminosity of any power law component is $1.8

upper limit does not reject the possible 2.1$\sigma$ detection by the BeppoSAX

report positive redshift evolution, with higher redshift galaxies harboring
more massive BHs than expected from the local relations. All of these studies
focus on broad line quasars with BH mass estimated from virial estimators based
on single-epoch spectra. Since the sample selection is largely based on quasar
luminosity, the cosmic scatter in the BH-bulge relation introduces a
statistical bias leading to on average more massive BHs given galaxy properties
at high redshift (Lauer et al. 2007). We here emphasize a previously
under-appreciated statistical bias resulting from the uncertainty of
single-epoch virial BH mass estimators and the shape of the underlying (true)
BH mass function, which leads to on average overestimation of the true BH
masses at the high-mass end (Shen et al. 2008). We demonstrate that the latter
virial mass bias can contribute a substantial amount to the observed excess in
BH mass at fixed bulge properties, comparable to the Lauer et al. bias. The
virial mass bias is independent of the Lauer et al. bias, hence if both biases
are at work, they can largely (or even fully) account for the observed BH mass
excess at high redshift.

on a Calabi-Yau manifold. It displays in particular the active role of a
four-form field. Constrained N=1 and N=2 superfields and the formulation of the
hypermultiplet in its single-tensor version are used to derive the nonlinear
realization, allowing a fully off-shell description. Exact results with
explicit symmetries and supersymmetries are then obtained. The
electric-magnetic dual version of the theory is also derived and the gauge
structure of the interaction is exemplified with N=2 nonlinear QED of a charged
hypermultiplet. Its Higgs phase describes a novel super-Higgs mechanism without
gravity, where the goldstino is combined with half of the hypermultiplet into
an N=1 massive vector multiplet.

planetary system containing a Super-Earth and a gas giant, both embedded in a
protoplanetary disc. We have shown that, if the Super-Earth is on the internal
orbit relative to the gas giant, the planets can easily become locked in a mean
motion resonance. This is no longer true, however, if the Super-Earth is on the

discuss the complementary question of the emergence of work flux from quantum

source quality of a system, one based on the generalized factorization
approximation, the other based on generalized definitions of work and heat. By
means of those methods, we show that small quantum systems can, indeed, act as

avoids fitting an inverse model and the problems associated with this. The
algorithm makes explicit use of the sensitivities of the data to the
parameters, with the goal of better treating parameters which only have a weak
impact on the data. The forward modelling approach provides uncertainty (full
covariance) estimates in the predicted parameters as well as a goodness-of-fit
for observations. I demonstrate the algorithm, ILIUM, with the estimation of
stellar astrophysical parameters (APs) from simulations of the low resolution
spectrophotometry to be obtained by Gaia. The AP accuracy is competitive with
that obtained by a support vector machine. For example, for zero extinction
stars covering a wide range of metallicity, surface gravity and temperature,
ILIUM can estimate Teff to an accuracy of 0.3% at G=15 and to 4% for (lower
signal-to-noise ratio) spectra at G=20. [Fe/H] and logg can be estimated to
accuracies of 0.1-0.4dex for stars with G<=18.5. If extinction varies a priori
over a wide range (Av=0-10mag), then Teff and Av can be estimated quite
accurately (3-4% and 0.1-0.2mag respectively at G=15), but there is a strong
and ubiquitous degeneracy in these parameters which limits our ability to
estimate either accurately at faint magnitudes. Using the forward model we can
map these degeneracies (in advance), and thus provide a complete probability
distribution over solutions. (Abridged)

Odin satellite resulted in a about 5 sigma detection toward the dense core rho
Oph A. At the frequency of the line, 119 GHz, the Odin telescope has a beam
width of 10', larger than the size of the dense core, so that the precise
nature of the emitting source and its exact location and extent are unknown.
The current investigation is intended to remedy this. Telluric absorption makes
ground based O_2 observations essentially impossible and observations had to be
done from space. mm-wave telescopes on space platforms were necessarily small,
which resulted in large, several arcminutes wide, beam patterns. Although the
Earth's atmosphere is entirely opaque to low-lying O_2 transitions, it allows
ground based observations of the much rarer O18O in favourable conditions and
at much higher angular resolution with larger telescopes. In addition, rho Oph
A exhibits both multiple radial velocity systems and considerable velocity
gradients. Extensive mapping of the region in the proxy C18O (J=3-2) line can
be expected to help identify the O_2 source on the basis of its line shape and
Doppler velocity. Line opacities were determined from observations of optically
thin 13C18O (J=3-2) at selected positions. During several observing periods,
two C18O intensity maxima in rho Oph A were searched for in the 16O18O
(2_1-0_1) line at 234 GHz with the 12m APEX telescope. Our observations
resulted in an upper limit on the integrated O18O intensity of < 0.01 K km/s (3
sigma) into the 26.5"" beam. We conclude that the source of observed O_2
emission is most likely confined to the central regions of the rho Oph A cloud.
In this limited area, implied O_2 abundances could thus be higher than
previously reported, by up to two orders of magnitude.

so far. They are conventionally classified into long and short ones depending
on their time duration, $T_{90}$. Because of the advantage their high redshifts
offer, many efforts have been made to apply GRBs to cosmology. The key to this
is to find correlations between some measurable properties of GRBs and the
energy or the luminosity of GRBs. These correlations are usually referred to as
luminosity relations and are helpful in understanding the GRBs themselves. In
this paper, we explored such correlations in the X-ray emission of GRBs. The
X-ray emission of GRBs observed by \emph{Swift} has the exponential functional
form in the prompt phase and relaxes to a power-law decay at time $T_p$. We
have assumed a linear relation between $\log L_{X, p}$ (with $L_{X, p}$ being
the X-ray luminosity at $T_p$) and $\log [T_p/(1+z)]$, but there is some
evidence for curvature in the data and the true relationship between $L_{X, p}$
and $T_p/(1+z)$ may be a broken power law. The limited GRB sample used in our
analysis is still not sufficient for us to conclude whether the break is real
or just an illusion caused by outliers. We considered both cases in our
analysis and discussed the implications of the luminosity relation, especially
on the time duration of GRBs and their classification.

proved that if a connected graph $G$ admits an interval $t$-coloring, then
$t\leq (d+1) (\Delta -1) +1$, and if $G$ is also bipartite, then this upper
bound can be improved to $t\leq d(\Delta -1) +1$, where $\Delta$ is the maximum
degree in $G$ and $d$ is the diameter of $G$. In this paper we show that these
upper bounds can not be significantly improved.

Phys. vol. 39, pg.645 (2009)",,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The instantonic approach for a $\phi^4$ model potential is reexamined in the
asymptotic limit. The path integral of the system is derived in semiclassical
approximation expanding the action around the classical background. It is shown
that the singularity in the path integral, arising from the zero mode in the
quantum fluctuation spectrum, can be tackled only assuming a {\it finite}
(although large) system size. On the other hand the standard instantonic method
assumes the (anti)kink as classical background. But the (anti)kink is the
solution of the Euler-Lagrange equation for the {\it infinite} size system.
This formal contradiction can be consistently overcome by the finite size
instantonic theory based on the Jacobi elliptic functions formalism. In terms
of the latter I derive in detail the classical background which solves the
finite size Euler-Lagrange equation and obtain the general path integral in
finite size. Both problem and solution offer an instructive example of fruitful
interaction between mathematics and physics.

computation. As a consequence, it is not possible to reliably evaluate the
hardware resources needed for the application of algorithms or the running of
programs. This is apparent in both computer science, for instance, in
cryptanalysis, and in neuroscience, for instance, comparative neuro-anatomy. A
System versus Environment game formalism is proposed based on Computability
Logic that allows to define a computational work function that describes the
theoretical and physical resources needed to perform any purely algorithmic
computation. Within this formalism, the cost of a computation is defined as the
sum of information storage over the steps of the computation. The size of the
computational device, eg, the action table of a Universal Turing Machine, the
number of transistors in silicon, or the number and complexity of synapses in a
neural net, is explicitly included in the computational cost. The proposed cost
function leads in a natural way to known computational trade-offs and can be
used to estimate the computational capacity of real silicon hardware and neural
nets. The theory is applied to a historical case of 56 bit DES key recovery, as
an example of application to cryptanalysis. Furthermore, the relative
computational capacities of human brain neurons and the C. elegans nervous
system are estimated as an example of application to neural nets.

R--symmetric N=2 supersymmetric model with extended gauge and Higgs sectors.
The annihilation of Dirac gauginos to leptons requires no chirality flip in the
final states so that it is not suppressed as in the Majorana case. This implies
that it can be sizable enough to explain the positron excess observed by the
PAMELA experiment with moderate or no boost factors. When squark masses are
heavy, the annihilation of Dirac gauginos to hadrons is controlled by their
Higgsino fraction and is driven by the $hZ$ and $W^+W^-$ final states.
Moreover, at variance with the Majorana case, Dirac gauginos with a
non-vanishing higgsino fraction can also have a vector coupling with the $Z$
gauge boson leading to a sizable spin--independent scattering cross section off
nuclei. Saturating the current antiproton limit, we show that Dirac gauginos
can leave a signal in direct detection experiments at the level of the
sensitivity of dark matter searches at present and in the near future.

as l^-(1+sigma), where sigma > 1. Despite the long range of hopping, we find
the same type of phase transition that occurs in the standard short-range TASEP
with a defect site where defect induces a macroscopic shock in the stationary
state. In particular, our model displays two main features characteristic of
the short-range TASEP with defect site: a growth of the shock width with system
size L as L^(1/2) or L^(1/3), depending on the existence of the particle-hole
symmetry, and the power-law decay in density profiles of the shock phase.
However, unlike the profiles in the short-range case, we find that the latter
are well reproduced by the mean-field approximation, which enables us to derive
the analytical expression for sigma-dependent exponent nu = sigma-1 of this
power-law decay and the point sigma_c = 4/3 at which the transition takes

of Saturn together with the re-analysis of an earlier (2002) observation from
the XMM-Newton archive and of three Chandra observations in 2003 and 2004.
While the XMM-Newton telescope resolution does not enable us to resolve
spatially the contributions of the planet's disk and rings to the X-ray flux,
we can estimate their strengths and their evolution over the years from
spectral analysis, and compare them with those observed with Chandra. The
spectrum of the X-ray emission is well fitted by an optically thin coronal
model with an average temperature of 0.5 keV. The addition of a fluorescent
oxygen emission line at ~0.53 keV improves the fits significantly. In
accordance with earlier reports, we interpret the coronal component as emission
from the planetary disk, produced by the scattering of solar X-rays in Saturn's
upper atmosphere, and the line as originating from the Saturnian rings. The
strength of the disk X-ray emission is seen to decrease over the period 2002 -
2005, following the decay of solar activity towards the current minimum in the
solar cycle. By comparing the relative fluxes of the disk X-ray emission and
the oxygen line, we suggest that the line strength does not vary over the years
in the same fashion as the disk flux. We consider possible alternatives for the
origin of the line. The connection between solar activity and the strength of
Saturn's disk X-ray emission is investigated and compared with that of Jupiter.
We also discuss the apparent lack of X-ray aurorae on Saturn and conclude that
they are likely to lie below the sensitivity threshold of current Earth-bound
observatories. A similar comparison for Uranus and Neptune leads to the same
disappointing conclusion.

  In this paper, we prove the algebra is free and of rank k^n (2n-1)!! over

These conditions are necessary in order for these results to hold and
originally arise from the representation theory of B_2^k, which is analysed by
the authors in a previous paper. Furthermore, we obtain a geometric realisation
of B_n^k as a cyclotomic version of the Kauffman tangle algebra, in terms of
affine n-tangles in the solid torus, and produce explicit bases that may be
described both algebraically and diagrammatically.
  The admissibility conditions are the most general offered in the literature

anomalous events because they are capable of detecting an extrasolar planet
companion orbiting the lens star. Fast and robust modelling methods are thus of
prime interest in helping to decide whether a planet is detected by an event.
Cassan (2008) introduced a new set of parameters to model binary-lens events,
which are closely related to properties of the light curve. In this work, we
explain how Bayesian priors can be added to this framework, and investigate on
interesting options. Methods: We develop a mathematical formulation that allows
us to compute analytically the priors on the new parameters, given some
previous knowledge about other physical quantities. We explicitly compute the
priors for a number of interesting cases, and show how this can be implemented
in a fully Bayesian, Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Results: Using
Bayesian priors can accelerate microlens fitting codes by reducing the time
spent considering physically implausible models, and helps us to discriminate
between alternative models based on the physical plausibility of their
parameters.

new photometric redshift catalogue of over 700,000 Luminous Red Galaxies (MegaZ

constraining as the addition of all SNe and BAO data available to date. The
upper limit is one of the tightest and `cleanest' constraints on the neutrino

and two dimensions. Both are realized by complex of D3-branes and D7-branes of
relative codimension 6 and 4, respectively. The setup with Fermi point models
gauge dynamics of multiply stacked graphenes at half-filling. I show that
string theory predicts dynamical generation of mass gap and metal-insulator
quantum phase transition at zero temperature. I emphasize that conformally
invariant gauge theory dynamics of the setup plays a crucial role, leading to
novel conformal phase transition. The setup with Fermi surface is in
collaboration with Dongsu Bak and is based on charged black hole and models
relativistic Fermi liquid. We find positive evidence for this identification
from both equilibrium thermodynamics at or near zero temperature and
out-of-equilibrium linear response and transport properties. I argue that

that the mean length of the shortest route between vertices at distance $r$
apart should grow only as $O(r)$ as $r \to \infty$, but this is not always easy
to verify. We give a general sufficient condition for such linearity, in the
setting of a Poisson point process. In a $L \times L$ square, define a
subnetwork $\GG_L$ to have the edges which are present regardless of the
configuration outside the square; the condition is that the largest component
