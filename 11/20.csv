(dE) satellite galaxies NGC 147 and NGC 185. The profiles represent the most
extensive spectroscopic radial coverage for any dE galaxy, extending to a
projected distance of eight half-light radii (8 r_eff = 14'). We achieve this
coverage via Keck/DEIMOS multislit spectroscopic observations of 520 and 442
member red giant branch stars in NGC 147 and NGC 185, respectively. In contrast
to previous studies, we find that both dEs have significant internal rotation.
We measure a maximum rotational velocity of 17+/-2 km/s for NGC 147 and 15+/-5
km/s for NGC 185. The velocity dispersions decrease gently with radius with an
average dispersion of 16+/-1 km/s for NGC 147 and 24+/-1 km/s for NGC 185. Both
dEs have internal metallicity dispersions of 0.5 dex, but show no evidence for
a radial metallicity gradient. We construct two-integral axisymmetric dynamical
models and find that the observed kinematical profiles cannot be explained
without modest amounts of non-baryonic dark matter. We measure central
mass-to-light ratios of ML_V = 4.2+/-0.6 and ML_V = 4.6+/-0.6 for NGC 147 and
NGC 185, respectively. Both dE galaxies are consistent with being primarily
flattened by their rotational motions, although some anisotropic velocity
dispersion is needed to fully explain their observed shapes. The velocity
profiles of all three Local Group dEs (NGC 147, NGC 185 and NGC 205) suggest
that rotation is more prevalent in the dE galaxy class than previously assumed,
but is often manifest only at several times the effective radius. Since all dEs
outside the Local Group have been probed to only inside the effective radius,
this opens the door for formation mechanisms in which dEs are transformed or
stripped versions of gas-rich rotating progenitor galaxies.

progress for ~500 infrared-selected galaxies. Using the new optical
classifications afforded by the extremely large data set of the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey, we find that the fraction of LINERs in IR-selected samples is rare
(< 5%) compared with other spectral types. The lack of strong infrared emission
in LINERs is consistent with recent optical studies suggesting that LINERs
contain AGN with lower accretion rates than in Seyfert galaxies. Most
previously classified infrared-luminous LINERs are classified as starburst-AGN
composite galaxies in the new scheme. Starburst-AGN composites appear to
""bridge"" the spectral evolution from starburst to AGN in ULIRGs. The relative
strength of the AGN versus starburst activity shows a significant increase at
high infrared luminosity. In ULIRGs (L_IR >10^12 L_odot), starburst-AGN
composite galaxies dominate at early--intermediate stages of the merger, and
AGN galaxies dominate during the final merger stages. Our results are
consistent with models for IR-luminous galaxies where mergers of gas-rich
spirals fuel both starburst and AGN, and where the AGN becomes increasingly
dominant during the final merger stages of the most luminous infrared objects.

  randomness has recently seen some revived attention in the literature (see
  arXiv:0911.3427). This idea was introduced in Chapter 5 of my thesis (from
  p103) which I am making available here. A condensed version of this chapter
  is now available as arXiv:1011.4474. (150 pages, PhD thesis, University of
  Cambridge, submitted Dec 2006)",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  After a general introduction, the thesis is divided into four parts. In the
first, we discuss the task of coin tossing, principally in order to highlight
the effect different physical theories have on security in a straightforward
manner, but, also, to introduce a new protocol for non-relativistic strong coin
tossing. This protocol matches the security of the best protocol known to date
while using a conceptually different approach to achieve the task.
  In the second part variable bias coin tossing is introduced. This is a
variant of coin tossing in which one party secretly chooses one of two biased
coins to toss. It is shown that this can be achieved with unconditional
security for a specified range of biases, and with cheat-evident security for
any bias. We also discuss two further protocols which are conjectured to be
unconditionally secure for any bias.
  The third section looks at other two-party secure computations for which,
prior to our work, protocols and no-go theorems were unknown. We introduce a
general model for such computations, and show that, within this model, a wide
range of functions are impossible to compute securely. We give explicit
cheating attacks for such functions.
  In the final chapter we discuss the task of expanding a private random
string, while dropping the usual assumption that the protocol's user trusts her
devices. Instead we assume that all quantum devices are supplied by an
arbitrarily malicious adversary. We give two protocols that we conjecture
securely perform this task. The first allows a private random string to be
expanded by a finite amount, while the second generates an arbitrarily large
expansion of such a string.

Turing machines to model the experimental procedures that govern the conduct of

limitations on the asymptotic stability of quantum information stored in

weak coupling to a ground state environment. We prove that, regardless of the
protecting Hamiltonian, there exists a perturbed evolution that necessitates a
final error correcting step when the state of the memory is read. Such an error
correction step is shown to require a finite error threshold, the lack thereof
being exemplified by the 3D compass model. We go on to present explicit weak

function. By using the theorem, we obtained the exact expressions of degree
distribution and clustering coefficient which behaved as universal power laws
within certain ranges of degrees. We also compared the theoretical predictions
with numerical results and found that they were extremely consistent.

$N_{f}=2$ light quark flavours can be described by orthogonal groups as $O(4)
\to O(3)$, due to local isomorphisms. Here we discuss the question how specific
this property is. We consider generalised forms of $\chi$SB involving an
arbitrary number of light flavours of continuum or lattice fermions, in various
representations. We search systematically for isomorphic descriptions by
non-unitary, compact Lie groups. It turns out that there are a few alternative
options in terms of orthogonal groups, while we did not find any description
entirely based on symplectic or exceptional Lie groups. If we adapt such an
alternative as the symmetry breaking pattern for a generalised Higgs mechanism,
we may consider a Higgs particle composed of bound fermions and trace back the
mass generation to $\chi$SB. In fact, some of the patterns that we encounter
appear in technicolour models. In particular if one observes a Higgs mechanism
that can be expressed in terms of orthogonal groups, we specify in which cases
it could also represent some kind of $\chi$SB of techniquarks.

problems explaining the origins of Uranus and Neptune: (1) dynamical times in

Myr, and (2) the onset of runaway gas accretion that begins when cores reach 10
Earth masses necessitates a sudden gas accretion cutoff just as the ice giant
cores reach critical mass. Both problems may be resolved by allowing the ice
giants to migrate outward after their formation in solid-rich feeding zones
with planetesimal surface densities well above the minimum-mass solar nebula.
We present new simulations of the formation of Uranus and Neptune in the
solid-rich disk of Dodson-Robinson et al. (2009) using the initial semimajor
axis distribution of the Nice model (Gomes et al. 2005; Morbidelli et al. 2005;
Tsiganis et al. 2005), with one ice giant forming at 12 AU and the other at 15
AU. The innermost ice giant reaches its present mass after 3.8-4.0 Myr and the
outermost after 5.3-6 Myr, a considerable time decrease from previous
one-dimensional simulations (e.g. Pollack et al. 1996). The core masses stay
subcritical, eliminating the need for a sudden gas accretion cutoff. Our
calculated carbon mass fractions of 22% are in excellent agreement with the ice
giant interior models of Podolak et al. (1995) and Marley et al. (1995). Based
on the requirement that the ice giant-forming planetesimals contain >10% mass
fractions of methane ice, we can reject any solar system formation model that
initially places Uranus and Neptune inside the orbit of Saturn. We also
demonstrate that a large population of planetesimals must be present in both
ice giant feeding zones throughout the lifetime of the gaseous nebula.

preferred in the model for mass parameters m_{SUSY} and m_{1/2} smaller than

severe constraint on the parameter space of the model either enforcing u approx

cancellation takes place in the amplitudes and the branching ratios scale as

the nearby Centaurus A Group. Although all large galaxies of the group have a
current or recent enhanced star formation episode, the dIs have normal star
formation rates and do not contain a larger fraction of dwarf starbursts than
other nearby groups. Relative distances between dIs and larger galaxies of the
group can be computed in 3D since most of them have now fairly accurately known
distances. We find that the dI star formation rates do not depend on local
environment, and in particular they do not show any correlation with the
distance of the dI to the nearest large galaxy of the group. There is a clear
morphology-density relation in the Centaurus A Group, similarly to the Sculptor
and Local Groups, in the sense that dEs/dSphs tend to be at small distances
from the more massive galaxies of the group, while dIs are on average at larger
distances. We find four transition dwarfs in the Group, dwarfs that show
characteristics of both dE/dSphs and dIs, and which contain cold gas but no
current star formation. Interestingly the transition dwarfs have an average
distance to the more massive galaxies which is intermediate between those of
the dEs/dSphs and dIs, and which is quite large: 0.54 +- 0.31 Mpc. This large
distance poses some difficulty for the most popular scenarios proposed for
transforming a dI into a dE/dSph (ram-pressure with tidal stripping or galaxy
harassment). If the observed transition dwarfs are indeed missing links between
dIs and dE/dSphs, their relative isolation makes it less likely to have been
produced by these mechanisms. We propose that an inhomogeneous IGM containing
higher density clumps would be able to ram-pressure stripped the dIs at such
large distances.

cm^-3 for the main outflow absorption component. The heavily reddened spectrum
of SDSS J0318-0600 requires purely silicate dust with a reddening curve

bolometric luminosity. We carry out photoionization modeling to determine the

the uncertainty in the location of the dust extinction, we arrive at two viable

where we consider the 6 kpc location as somewhat more physically plausable.
Assuming the canonical global covering of 20% for the outflow and a distance of
6 kpc, our analysis yields a mass flux of 120 M_sun yr^-1 and a kinetic
luminosity that is ~0.1% of the bolometric luminosity of the object. Should the

shown that galactic winds occur in most galaxies with high infrared
luminosities. However, in infrared-bright composite systems where a starburst
coexists with an active galactic nucleus (AGN), it is unclear whether the
starburst, the AGN, or both are driving the outflows. The present paper
describes the results from a search for outflows in 35 infrared-faint Seyferts
with 10^9.9 < L_IR/L_sun < 10^11, or, equivalently, star formation rates (SFR)
of ~0.4 -- 9 solar masses per year, to attempt to isolate the source of the
outflow. We find that the outflow detection rates for the infrared-faint
Seyfert 1s (6%) and Seyfert 2s (18%) are lower than previously reported for
infrared-luminous Seyfert 1s (50%) and Seyfert 2s (45%). The outflow kinematics
of infrared-faint and infrared-bright Seyfert 2 galaxies resemble those of
starburst galaxies, while the outflow velocities in Seyfert 1 galaxies are
significantly larger. Taken together, these results suggest that the AGN does
not play a significant role in driving the outflows in most infrared-faint and
infrared-bright systems, except the high-velocity outflows seen in Seyfert 1
galaxies. Another striking result of this study is the high rate of detection
of inflows in infrared-faint galaxies (39% of Seyfert 1s, 35% of Seyfert 2s),
significantly larger than in infrared-luminous Seyferts (15%). This inflow may
be contributing to the feeding of the AGN in these galaxies, and potentially
provides more than enough material to power the observed nuclear activity over
typical AGN lifetimes.

Incorporating photometry of all relevant stars simultaneously, CMD fitting
bypasses the need to choose single tracer populations. Using old stellar
populations of differing metallicities as templates we obtain a sparse 3D map
of the stellar mass distribution at |Z|>1 kpc. Fitting a smooth Milky Way model
comprising exponential thin and thick disks and an axisymmetric power-law halo
allows us to constrain the structural parameters of the thick disk and halo.
The thick-disk scale height and length are well constrained at 0.75+-0.07 kpc
and 4.1+-0.4 kpc, respectively. We find a stellar halo flattening within ~25
kpc of c/a=0.88+-0.03 and a power-law index of 2.75+-0.07 (for 7<R_{GC}<~30
kpc). The model fits yield thick-disk and stellar halo densities at the solar
location of rho_{thick,sun}=10^{-2.3+-0.1} M_sun pc^{-3} and
rho_{halo,sun}=10^{-4.20+-0.05} M_sun pc^{-3}, averaging over any
substructures. Our analysis provides the first clear in situ evidence for a
radial metallicity gradient in the Milky Way's stellar halo: within R<~15 kpc
the stellar halo has a mean metallicity of [Fe/H]=-1.6, which shifts to
[Fe/H]=-2.2 at larger radii. Subtraction of the best-fit smooth and symmetric
model from the overall density maps reveals a wealth of substructures at all
latitudes, some attributable to known streams and overdensities, and some new.
A simple warp cannot account for the low latitude substructure, as
overdensities occur simultaneously above and below the Galactic plane.

operative at the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT). It is a broad-band
medium-resolution spectrograph designed with gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow
spectroscopy as one of its main science drivers.
  Aims. During the first commissioning night on sky with the instrument fully
assembled, X-shooter observed the afterglow of GRB 090313 as a demonstration of
the instrument's capabilities.
  Methods. GRB 090313 was observed almost two days after the burst onset, when
the object had already faded to R~21.6. Furthermore, the 90% illuminated Moon
was just 30 degrees away from the field. In spite of the adverse conditions, we
obtained a spectrum that, for the first time in GRB research, covers
simultaneously the range from 5700 to 23000 Angstroms.
  Results. The spectrum shows multiple absorption features at a redshift of
3.3736, the redshift of the GRB. These features are composed of 3 components
with different ionisation levels and velocities. Some of the features have
never been observed before in a GRB at such a high redshift. Furthermore, we
detect two intervening systems at redshifts of 1.8005 and 1.9597.
  Conclusions. These results demonstrate the potential of X-shooter in the GRB
field, as it was capable of observing a GRB down to a magnitude limit that
would include 72% of long GRB afterglows 2 hours after the burst onset. Coupled
with the rapid response mode available at VLT, allowing reaction times of just
a few minutes, X-shooter constitutes an important leap forward on medium
resolution spectroscopic studies of GRBs, their host galaxies and intervening
systems, probing the early history of the Universe.

$v^2 \lsim (HL)^2 \lsim (\rho_\sigma + \rho_\mu)/\rho_m$ where $H$ is the
Hubble parameter and $\rho_\sigma$, $\rho_\mu$ and $\rho_m$ are the average
density of domain walls, strings and monopole-type junctions. We further show
that if domain walls are to provide a significant contribution to the dark
energy without generating exceedingly large CMB temperature fluctuations then,
at the present time, the network must have a characteristic length $ L_0 \lsim
10 \Omega_{\sigma 0}^{-2/3} {\rm kpc}$ and a characteristic velocity $v_0 \lsim
10^{-5} \Omega_{\sigma 0}^{-2/3}$ where $\Omega_{\sigma 0}=\rho_{\sigma

constraints with $\Omega_{\sigma 0} \sim 1$, $\rho_{m 0}$ would have to be at
least 10 orders of magnitude larger than $\rho_{\sigma 0}$, which would be in
complete disagreement with observations. This result provides very strong
additional support for the conjecture that no natural frustration mechanism,
which could lead to a significant contribution of domain walls to the dark
energy budget, exists.

assessing the timing and intensity of fossil bursts requires more effort,

For ages older than ~1 Gyr, this type of observation is currently limited to
the Local Group and its immediate surroundings. However, if the Local Volume is
representative of the Universe as a whole, then studies of the age and
metallicity distributions of star clusters and resolved stellar populations
should give statistical clues as to the frequency and importance of bursts to
the histories of galaxies in general. Based on starburst statistics in the
literature and synthetic colour-magnitude diagram studies of Local Group
galaxies, I attempt to distinguish between systemic starbursts that strongly
impact galaxy evolution and stochastic bursts that can appear impressive but
are ultimately of little significance on gigayear timescales. As a specific

falls into the latter category and is not fundamentally different from other

which to measure the properties of astrophysical magnetized plasmas.
Unfortunately, typical observations provide information only about the
density-weighted average of the magnetic field component parallel to the line
of sight. As a result, the magnetic field geometry along the line of sight, and
in many cases even the location of the rotating material, is poorly
constrained. Frequently, interpretations of Faraday rotation observations are
dependent upon underlying models of the magnetic field being probed (e.g.,
uniform, turbulent, equipartition). However, we show that at sufficiently low
frequencies, specifically below roughly 13 (RM/rad m^-2)^(1/4) (B/G)^(1/2) MHz,
the character of Faraday rotation changes, entering what we term the
``super-adiabatic regime'' in which the rotation measure is proportional to the
integrated absolute value of the line-of-sight component of the field. As a
consequence, comparing rotation measures at high frequencies with those in this
new regime provides direct information about the geometry of the magnetic field
along the line of sight. Furthermore, the frequency defining the transition to
this new regime, nu_SA, depends directly upon the local electron density and
magnetic field strength where the magnetic field is perpendicular to the line
of sight, allowing the unambiguous distinction between Faraday rotation within
and in front of the emission region. Typical values of nu_SA range from 10 kHz
to 10 GHz, depending upon the details of the Faraday rotating environment. In
particular, for resolved AGN, including the black holes at the center of the
Milky Way (Sgr A*) and M81, nu_SA ranges from roughly 10 MHz to 10 GHz, and
thus can be probed via existing and up-coming ground-based radio observatories.

Many studies have explored the stellar growth of massive galaxies but few have

highlight our work aimed at identifying AGNs in z~2 luminous dust-obscured

to identify some of the most heavily obscured AGNs in the Universe (i.e., AGNs
obscured by Compton-thick material; N_H>1.5x10^24 cm^-2). On the basis of these

the well-known Schwinger mechanism, which is assumed to be realized by
longitudinally coupled bound state poles, produced by the non-perturbative

Schwinger-Dyson equation of the gluon propagator through the three-gluon
vertex, generating a non-vanishing gluon mass, which, however, is expressed in
terms of divergent seagull integrals. In this talk we explain how such
divergences can be eliminated completely by virtue of a characteristic
identity, valid in dimensional regularization. The ability to trigger this
identity depends, in turn, on the details of the three-gluon vertex employed,
and in particular, on the exact way the bound state poles are incorporated. A
concrete example of a vertex that triggers the aforementioned identity is
constructed, the ensuing cancellation of all seagull divergences is explicitly
demonstrated, and a finite gluon mass is obtained. Due to the multitude of
conditions that must be simultaneously satisfied, this construction appears to
be exclusively realized within the PT-BFM framework. The resulting system of
integral equations gives rise to a gluon mass that displays power-law running
and an effective charge which, due to the presence of the gluon mass, freezes
in the infrared at a finite (non-vanishing) value.

the relation to their X-ray emission (derived from the XMM-COSMOS

function of luminosity and redshift. The sample was selected on the basis of
the optical emission line ratios, after applying a cut to the signal-to-noise
ratio (S/N) of the relevant lines. We used the standard diagnostic diagrams
[OIII]/Hbeta versus [NII]/Halpha and ([OIII]/Hbeta versus [SII]/Halpha) to
isolate AGN in the redshift range 0.15<z<0.45 and the diagnostic diagram
[OIII]/Hbeta versus [OII]/Hbeta to extend the selection to higher redshift
(0.5<z<0.92). Combining our sample with one drawn from SDSS, we found that the
best description of the evolution of type-2 AGN is a luminosity-dependent
density evolution model. Moreover, using the type-1 AGN LF we were able to
constrain the fraction of type-2 AGN to the total (type-1 + type-2) AGN
population. We found that the type-2 fraction decreases with luminosity, in
agreement with the most recent results, and shows signs of a slight increase
with redshift. However, the trend with luminosity is visible only after
combining the SDSS+zCOSMOS samples. From the COSMOS data points alone, the
type-2 fraction seems to be quite constant with luminosity.

two manifolds with boundary along an oriented smooth hypersurface, then the
signature of the original manifold equals the sum of the signatures of the
resulting manifolds with boundary. Wall showed that this property is not true
of signatures on manifolds with boundary and that the difference from
additivity could be described as a certain Maslov triple index. Perverse
signatures are signatures defined for any stratified pseudomanifold, using the
intersection homology groups of Goresky and MacPherson. In the case of Witt
spaces, the middle perverse signature is the same as the Witt signature. This
paper proves a generalization to perverse signatures of Wall's non-additivity
theorem for signatures of manifolds with boundary. Under certain topological
conditions on the dividing hypersurface,Novikov additivity for perverse

which the symbol error rate (SER) is convex/concave for arbitrary
multi-dimensional constellations. In particular, the SER is convex in SNR for
any one- and two-dimensional constellation, and also in higher dimensions at
high SNR. Pairwise error probability and bit error rate are shown to be convex
at high SNR, for arbitrary constellations and bit mapping. Universal bounds for
the SER 1st and 2nd derivatives are obtained, which hold for arbitrary
constellations and are tight for some of them. Applications of the results are
discussed, which include optimum power allocation in spatial multiplexing
systems, optimum power/time sharing to decrease or increase (jamming problem)
error rate, an implication for fading channels (""fading is never good in low
dimensions"") and optimization of a unitary-precoded OFDM system. For example,
the error rate bounds of a unitary-precoded OFDM system with QPSK modulation,
which reveal the best and worst precoding, are extended to arbitrary

non-thermal motions dominate the Core kinematics, and remain transonic at
densities n ~ 3 x 10^5 cm^-3 with large scatter and no trend with N(H2).
Non-thermal motions in Oph B1 and B3 are subsonic with little variation, but
also show no trend with H2 column density. Over all Oph B, non-thermal N2H+
line widths are substantially narrower than those traced by NH3, making it
unlikely NH3 and N2H+ trace the same material, but the v_LSR of both species
agree well. We find evidence for accretion in Oph B1 from the surrounding
ambient gas. The NH3/N2H+ abundance ratio is larger towards starless Oph B1
than towards protostellar Oph B2, similar to recent observational results in
other star-forming regions. Small-scale structure is found in the ATCA N2H+ 1-0

particular, the ~1 M_Sun B2-MM8 clump is associated with a N2H+ emission

of the parent body and the gravitational interactions between the fragments,
have allowed us to reproduce successfully the main properties of asteroid
families formed in different regimes of impact energy, starting from a
non-porous parent body. In this paper, using the same approach, we concentrate
on a single regime of impact energy, the so-called catastrophic threshold
usually designated by Q*D, which results in the escape of half of the target's
mass. Thanks to our recent implementation of a model of fragmentation of porous
materials, we can characterize Q*D for both porous and non-porous targets with
a wide range of diameters. We can then analyze the potential influence of
porosity on the value of Q*D, and by computing the gravitational phase of the
collision in the gravity regime, we can characterize the collisional outcome in
terms of the fragment size and ejection speed distributions, which are the main
outcome properties used by collisional models to study the evolutions of the
different populations of small bodies. We also check the dependency of Q*D on
the impact speed of the projectile. In the strength regime, which corresponds
to target sizes below a few hundreds of meters, we find that porous targets are
more difficult to disrupt than non-porous ones. In the gravity regime, the
outcome is controlled purely by gravity and porosity in the case of porous
targets. In the case of non-porous targets, the outcome also depends on
strength. We then propose some power-law relationships between Q*D and both
target's size and impact speed that can be used in collisional evolution
models.

typically accomplished by minimizing the classification error rate on a set of

large-scale practical applications, however, such labeled development data are
typically costly and difficult to obtain. This article proposes an alternative
semi-supervised framework for likelihood-based model selection that leverages
unlabeled data by using trained classifiers representing each model to
automatically generate putative labels. The errors that result from this
automatic labeling are shown to be amenable to results from robust statistics,
which in turn provide for minimax-optimal censored likelihood ratio tests that
recover the nonparametric sign test as a limiting case. This approach is then
validated experimentally using a state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition
system to select between candidate word pronunciations using unlabeled speech
data that only potentially contain instances of the words under test. Results
provide supporting evidence for the utility of this approach, and suggest that
it may also find use in other applications of machine learning.

This
nonlocal system is a simplified one-dimensional system of the 3D model that was
recently proposed by Hou and Lei in [13] for axisymmetric 3D incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations with swirl. The main difference between the 3D model of
Hou and Lei and the reformulated 3D Navier-Stokes equations is that the
convection term is neglected in the 3D model. In the nonlocal system we
consider in this paper, we replace the Riesz operator in the 3D model by the
Hilbert transform. One of the main results of this paper is that we prove
rigorously the finite time singularity formation of the nonlocal system for a
large class of smooth initial data with finite energy. We also prove the global
regularity for a class of smooth initial data. Numerical results will be
presented to demonstrate the asymptotically self-similar blow-up of the
solution. The blowup rate of the self-similar singularity of the nonlocal
system is similar to that of the 3D model.

Hamiltonian dynamics of a one-dimensional anharmonic oscillator lattice. For a
homogeneous (uniform mass) lattice in the weakly chaotic regime and for a heavy
impurity embedded in the lattice, the results stemming from the time record of
the position and momentum of a single oscillator in the former case, and for
that same variables corresponding to the impurity in the latter, are
inconclusive to determine the dynamical regime of the system. This seemingly
odd behavior has its origin in the insufficient time series length employed.
Nevertheless, for both cases the necessary time record length needed to obtain
the correct result renders the test impractical. In particular, for the second
case, specially in the large system size limit (which is the physically
relevant one due to its connection with Brownian motion), the estimated length
of the position time series required by the test to correctly classify the
signal is beyond the reach of present-day computer capability. Thus our results
indicate that the proposed test, for the aforementioned cases of Hamiltonian
chaos, affords no clear advantage over conventional phase space reconstruction

equipped with a self-concordant barrier, whose mixing time from a ""central
point"" is strongly polynomial in the description of the convex set. The mixing
time of this chain is invariant under affine transformations of the convex set,
thus eliminating the need for first placing the body in an isotropic position.
This recovers and extends previous results of from polytopes to more general
convex sets. On every convex set of dimension $n$, there exists a
self-concordant barrier whose ""complexity"" is polynomially bounded.
Consequently, a rapidly mixing Markov chain of the kind we describe can be
defined on any convex set. We use these results to design an algorithm
consisting of a single random walk for optimizing a linear function on a convex
set. We show that this random walk reaches an approximately optimal point in
polynomial time with high probability and that the corresponding objective
values converge with probability 1 to the optimal objective value as the number
of steps tends to infinity. One technical contribution is a family of lower
bounds for the isoperimetric constants of (weighted) Riemannian manifolds on
which, interior point methods perform a kind of steepest descent. Using results
of Barthe \cite{barthe} and Bobkov and Houdr\'e, on the isoperimetry of
products of (weighted) Riemannian manifolds, we obtain sharper upper bounds on
the mixing time of Dikin walk on products of convex sets than the bounds
obtained from a direct application of the Localization Lemma, on which, since
(Lov\'asz and Simonovits), the analyses of all random walks on convex sets have
relied.

system consists of (1) pressure sensors, (2) a laptop coupling sensors and
actuator (3) a wireless Tongue Display Unit (TDU) consisting of a circuit

these overpressures and (3) communicating this change through directional
information transmitted by the TDU. Twenty-four healthy subjects voluntarily

the equations governing the dynamics of magnetized plasma and fields. In this
model, the Chern-Simons (CS) part consists of a dynamical pseudo-scalar field
whose space-time derivatives couple with the electromagnetic field. We explore
the CS corrections to the evolution equation for the magnetic field in a plasma
with non-zero electrical resistivity. We revisit Cowling's theorem in this
context and observe that the CS corrections lead to possibly small but non-zero
source terms for axisymmetric magnetic field. The scalar product of electric
and magnetic fields play the role of source of the pseudo-scalar field, and
therefore, pulsars and magnetars are likely astrophysical candidates to
generate propagating pseudo-scalar waves. Although aligned electric field gets
shorted out by flowing charges in large parts of the magnetosphere, there are
vacuum gaps in the vicinity of pulsars where strong $\vec E. \vec B$ is
expected to be present. We derive a wave solution for the pseudo-scalar field
generated by the time-varying $\vec E. \vec B$ associated with a pulsar.

of an oriented graph $D$ one can obtain if $D$ does not contain a fixed
oriented graph $H$ as a subgraph. The related question in the unoriented case
has been an active area of research, and is relatively well-understood in the
theory of quasi-random graphs and extremal combinatorics. In this paper, we
consider the simplest cases of such a general question for oriented graphs, and
provide some results on the global behavior of the orientation of $D$. For the
case that $H$ is an oriented four-cycle we prove: in every $H$-free oriented
graph $D$, there is a pair $A,B\ssq V(D)$ such that $e(A,B)\ge
e(D)^{2}/32|D|^{2}$ and $e(B,A)\le e(A,B)/2$. We give a random construction
which shows that this bound on $e(A,B)$ is best possible (up to the constant).
In addition, we prove a similar result for the case $H$ is an oriented
six-cycle, and a more precise result in the case $D$ is dense and $H$ is
arbitrary. We also consider the related extremal question in which no condition
is put on the oriented graph $D$, and provide an answer that is best possible
up to a multiplicative constant. Finally, we raise a number of related
questions and conjectures.

the Gibbs entropy $S$ and the relative entropy $F$, which are related via the
stationary distribution of the stochastic dynamics. $S$ satisfies the
fundamental entropy balance equation $dS/dt=e_p-h_d/T$ with entropy production

wherein each cell is implemented as either NAND or NOR floating gate. NAND
flash is currently the most widely used type of flash memory. In a NAND flash
memory, every block of cells consists of numerous pages; rewriting even a
single page requires the whole block to be erased and reprogrammed. Block
erasures determine both the longevity and the efficiency of a flash memory.
Therefore, when data in a NAND flash memory are reorganized, minimizing the
total number of block erasures required to achieve the desired data movement is
an important goal. This leads to the flash data movement problem studied in
this paper. We show that coding can significantly reduce the number of block
erasures required for data movement, and present several optimal or nearly
optimal data-movement algorithms based upon ideas from coding theory and
combinatorics. In particular, we show that the sorting-based (non-coding)
schemes require at least O(nlogn) erasures to move data among n blocks, whereas
coding-based schemes require only O(n) erasures. Furthermore, coding-based
schemes use only one auxiliary block, which is the best possible, and achieve a
good balance between the number of erasures in each of the n+1 blocks.

electrostatic field acceleration in the vicinity of the black hole up to
Fermi-type particle acceleration in the jet and beyond, possible efficiency
constraints on the energization of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) are
evaluated. When paradigmatically applied to Cen A, the following results are
obtained: (i) Proton acceleration to energies of $E_c = 5\times 10^{19}$ eV and
beyond remains challenging and most likely requires the operation of an
additional mechanism capable of boosting energetic seed protons up by a factor
of $\sim$ten. It is argued that shear acceleration along the large-scale jet in
Cen A could be a promising candidate for this. (ii) Heavier elements, like iron
nuclei, are more easily accelerated (by, e.g., shocks or direct electrostatic
fields) and may not need additional boosting to reach $E \geq E_c$; (iii) If
Cen A indeed proves to be an UHECR source, the cosmic ray composition might
thus be expected to become heavier above energies of a few times $10^{19}$ eV.

complexity theory. Perhaps the earliest use of XOR games was in the study of
quantum correlations. XOR games also have an interesting connection to
Grothendieck's inequality, a fundamental theorem of analysis, which shows that
two players sharing entanglement can achieve at most a constant factor
advantage over players following classical strategies in an XOR game.
  Perez-Garcia et al. show that when the players share GHZ states, this
advantage is bounded by a constant. We use a multilinear generalization of
Grothendieck's inequality due to Blei and Tonge to simplify the proof of the
second result and extend it to the case of so-called Schmidt states, answering
an open problem of Perez-Garcia et al. Via a reduction given in that paper,
this answers a 35-year-old problem in operator algebras due to Varopoulos,
showing that the space of compact operators on a Hilbert space is a Q-algebra
under Schur product.
  A further generalization of Grothendieck's inequality due to Carne lets us
show that the gap between the entangled and classical value is at most a
constant in any multiplayer XOR game in which the players are allowed to share
combinations of GHZ states and EPR pairs of any dimension.
  As an application of our results, we show that the discrepancy method in
communication complexity remains a lower bound in the multiparty model where
the players have quantum communication and the kinds of entanglement discussed
above. This answers an open question of Lee, Schechtman, and Shraibman.

answer the question: (a) Under what conditions is the stationary state

models (i), (ii), and (iii), in which each spin ""sees"" only half of its
neighbours, there is a unique set of transition rates, namely with exponential
dependence in the local field, for which this is the case. For model (iv), we
find that any rates satisfying the constraints required for the stationary
measure to be Gibbsian should satisfy detailed balance, ruling out the
possibility of directed dynamics. We finally show that directed models on
lattices of coordination number $z\ge8$ with exponential rates cannot
accommodate a Gibbsian stationary state. We conjecture that this property
extends to any form of the rates. We are thus led to the conclusion that
directed models with Gibbsian stationary states only exist in dimension one and
two. We then raise the question: (b) Do directed Ising models, augmented by
Glauber dynamics, exhibit a phase transition to a ferromagnetic state? For the
models considered above, the answers are open problems, to the exception of the
simple cases (i) and (ii). For Cayley trees, where each spin sees only the

rotation measures (RMs) in the targets, and reveals an important new
observational trend. The azimuthal distribution of polarized flux seems to be
intimately related to the kinematic orientation of galaxies, such that in
face-on galaxies the lowest level of polarized flux is detected along the
kinematic major axis. In highly inclined galaxies, the polarized flux is
minimized on both ends of the major axis, and peaks near the minor axis. Using
models of various three-dimensional magnetic field geometries, and including
the effects of turbulent depolarization in the midplane, we are able to
reproduce the qualitative distribution of polarized flux in the target
galaxies, its variation with inclination, and the distribution of RMs, thereby
constraining the global magnetic field structure in galaxies. Future radio
telescope facilities, now being planned and constructed, will have properties
making them extremely well-suited to perform vastly larger surveys of this

Astronomy (PRA) conference held on 2-5 June 2009 in Groningen, the Netherlands.
The conference was motivated by the on-going development of a large number of
new radio telescopes and instruments which, within a few years, will bring a
major improvement over current facilities. Interferometers such as the EVLA,
ASKAP, ATA, MeerKAT, and APERTIF will provide a combination of larger field of
view and increased simultaneous bandwidth, while maintaining good collecting
area and angular resolution. They will achieve a survey speed 10-50 times
larger at 1-2 GHz than the current possibilities, allowing for the first time
optical-like all-sky extra-galactic surveys at these frequencies.
  Significant progress will be made in many fields of radio astronomy. In this
conference we focused on research into the evolution of galaxies over the past
few Gyr. In particular, wide-field observations at 1-2 GHz will provide an
unprecedented panoramic view of the gas properties and star formation in
galaxies, embedded in their environment, from z~0.2-0.5 to the present. Within
the framework of our current knowledge of the galaxy population at z<0.5, we
discussed: the key science questions that the new telescopes will permit us to
answer in combination with complimentary work at other wavelengths; the
observing modes and analysis strategies which will allow us to most efficiently
exploit the data; and the techniques for most effectively coping with the huge
volume of survey products, so far unusual for the radio community. Emphasis was
placed on the complementarity of the upcoming facilities and on their role in
paving the way for the technological development and science goals of the
Square Kilometre Array.

halo. We have secured observational data in a complete wavelength range in
order to pin down the abundances of half a dozen elements in the nebula. The
abundances are obtained via detailed photoionization modelling taking into
account all the observational constraints (including geometry and aperture
effects) using the pseudo-3D photoionization code Cloudy_3D. The spectral
energy distribution of the ionizing radiation is taken from appropriate model
atmospheres. Both stellar components contribute to the ionization: the ``cool''
one provides the bulk of hydrogen ionization, and the ``hot'' one is
responsible for the presence of the most highly charged ions, which explains
why previous attempts to model the nebula experienced difficulties. The nebular
abundances of C, N, O, and Ne are found to be respectively, 1/3.5, 1/4.2, 1/70,
and 1/11 of the Solar value, with uncertainties of a factor 2. Thus the extreme
O deficiency of this object is confirmed. The abundances of S and Ar are less
than 1/30 of Solar. Standard models of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis
cannot explain the abundance pattern observed in the nebula. To obtain an
extreme oxygen deficiency in a star whose progenitor has an initial mass of
about 1 msun requires an additional mixing process, which can be induced by
stellar rotation and/or by the presence of the close companion. We have
computed a stellar model with initial mass of 1 msun, appropriate metallicity,
and initial rotation of 100 kms, and find that rotation greatly improves the
agreement between the predicted and observed abundances.

adopted are described in detail, with the aim of easing further independent
studies. Several results are obtained by the present calculation. The profiles
of the magnitude and phase of the gap parameter across the Josephson barrier
are determined under a variety of conditions. We find that the Josephson
current is considerably enhanced at about unitarity for all barriers we have
considered. A related enhancement is also found in the contribution to the
total current from the Andreev bound states, which stem from the depression of
the gap profile about the barrier.For vanishing barrier height, we find that
the critical Josephson current approaches the limiting value predicted by the
Landau criterion, which is determined by either pair-breaking or sound-mode
excitations depending on the coupling value. In the BCS limit, we reveal the
presence of Friedel oscillations in the oscillatory modulations of the gap and
density profiles. In this limit, we also emphasize the special role played by
the Andreev bound state in determining the critical Josephson current in the
presence of a barrier. Finally, the stability of the two branches, out of which
the Josephson characteristics are composed, is analyzed by calculating the
energy required to produce a given spatial profile of the gap parameter.

nonlinear factor models - the ""StressVaR"" (SVaR). Developed to evaluate the
risk of hedge funds, the SVaR appears to be applicable to a wide range of
investments. Its principle is to use the fairly short and sparse history of the
hedge fund returns to identify relevant risk factors among a very broad set of
possible risk sources. This risk profile is obtained by calibrating a
collection of nonlinear single-factor models as opposed to a single
multi-factor model. We then use the risk profile and the very long and rich
history of the factors to asses the possible impact of known past crises on the
funds, unveiling their hidden risks and so called ""black swans"".
  In backtests using data of 1060 hedge funds we demonstrate that the SVaR has
better or comparable properties than several common VaR measures - shows less
VaR exceptions and, perhaps even more importantly, in case of an exception, by
smaller amounts.
  The ultimate test of the StressVaR however, is in its usage as a fund
allocating tool. By simulating a realistic investment in a portfolio of hedge
funds, we show that the portfolio constructed using the StressVaR on average
outperforms both the market and the portfolios constructed using common VaR
measures.
  For the period from Feb. 2003 to June 2009, the StressVaR constructed
portfolio outperforms the market by about 6% annually, and on average the
competing VaR measures by around 3%. The performance numbers from Aug. 2007 to

dynamical approaches to evolution are not able to make quantitative,
falsifiable predictions about the long-term behavior of evolutionary systems. A
key characteristic of evolutionary systems is the ongoing endogenous production
of new species. These novel entities change the conditions for already existing
species. Even {\em Darwin's Demon}, a hypothetical entity with exact knowledge
of the abundance of all species and their fitness functions at a given time,
could not pre-state the impact of these novelties on established populations.
We argue that fitness is always {\it a posteriori} knowledge -- it measures but
does not explain why a species has reproductive success or not. To overcome
these conceptual limitations, a variational principle is proposed in a
spin-model-like setup of evolutionary systems. We derive a functional which is
minimized under the most general evolutionary formulation of a dynamical
system, i.e. evolutionary trajectories causally emerge as a minimization of a
functional. This functional allows the derivation of analytic solutions of the
asymptotic diversity for stochastic evolutionary systems within a mean-field
approximation. We test these approximations by numerical simulations of the
corresponding model and find good agreement in the position of phase
transitions in diversity curves. The model is further able to reproduce
stylized facts of timeseries from several man-made and natural evolutionary
systems. Light will be thrown on how species and their fitness landscapes

provide a service at an assured service level while optimizing the global usage

identifier in the IP header; the so-called Differentiated Services code point
(DSCP). Basically, Multi-Field classifiers classify a packet by inspecting
IP/TCP headers, to decide how the packet should be processed. The current IPSec
standard does hardly offer any guidance to do this, because the existing IPSec
ESP security protocol hides much of this information in its encrypted payloads,
preventing network control devices such as routers and switches from utilizing
this information in performing classification appropriately. To solve this

structure of the ancestor relation during unfolding introduces significant

notion of covering ancestors which can be used in combination with a wqo and
allows a stack-based implementation without losing any opportunities for
specialization. Using our technique, certain non-leftmost unfoldings are
allowed as long as local unfolding is performed, i.e., we cover depth-first

modelling results. We find that the star formation histories of ULIRGs are
complex, with at least two epochs of star formation activity and that the
charcteristic timescale of the star formation acivity is <100Myr. These results
are consistent with models that predict an epoch of enhanced star formation
coinciding with the first pass of the merging nuclei, along with a further,
more intense, episode of star formation occurring as the nuclei finally merge
together. It is also found that the young stellar populations (YSPs) tend to be
younger and more reddened in the nuclear regions of the galaxies. This is in
good agreement with the merger simulations, which predict that the bulk of the
star formation activity in the final stages of mergers will occur in the
nuclear regions of the merging galaxies. In addition, our results show that
ULIRGs have total stellar masses that are similar to, or smaller than, the
break of the galaxy mass function (m* = 1.4 x 10^{11} Msolar). Finally, we find
no significant differences between the ages of the YSP in ULIRGs with and
without optically detected Seyfert nuclei, nor between those with warm and cool
mid- to far-IR colours. While this results do not entirely rule out the idea
that cool ULIRGs with HII/LINER spectra evolve into warm ULIRGs with
Seyfert-like spectra, it is clear that the AGN activity in local Seyfert-like
ULIRGs has not been triggered a substantial period (>=100 Myr) after the major
merger-induced starbursts in the nuclear regions.

is derived in super-cooled liquids, assuming that the main effect of
temperature changes is to rescale the vibrational spectrum. Deviations from
this relation, in particular due to the presence of a Boson Peak whose shape
and frequency changes with temperature, are estimated. Using observations of
the short-time dynamics in liquids of various fragility, it is argued that (i)
if the crystal entropy is significantly smaller than the liquid entropy at
$T_g$, the extrapolation of the vibrational entropy leads to the correlation
$T_K\approx T_0$, where $T_K$ is the Kauzmann temperature and $T_0$ is the
temperature extracted from the Vogel-Fulcher fit of the viscosity. (ii) The
jump in specific heat associated with vibrational entropy is very small for
strong liquids, and increases with fragility. The analysis suggests that these
correlations stem from the stiffening of the Boson Peak under cooling,
underlying the importance of this phenomenon on the dynamical arrest.

of classical solutions to type IIA string theory in AdS4 x CP3. This involves
computing the spectrum of fluctuations and then adding up the fluctuation
frequencies. We focus on two classical solutions with support in CP3: a
rotating point-particle and a circular spinning string with two angular momenta
equal to J. For each of these solutions, we compute the spectrum of
fluctuations using two techniques, known as the algebraic curve approach and
the world-sheet approach. If we use the same prescription for adding
fluctuation frequencies that was used for type IIB string theory in AdS5 x S5,
then we find that the world-sheet spectrum gives convergent one-loop
corrections but the algebraic curve spectrum gives divergent ones. On the other
hand, we find a new summation prescription which gives finite results when
applied to both the algebraic curve and world-sheet spectra. Naively, this
gives three predictions for the one-loop correction to the spinning string
energy (one from the algebraic curve and two from the world-sheet), however we
find that in the large-j limit (where j=J/sqrt(2pi^2 lambda)), the j^(-2n)
terms in all three cases agree. We therefore obtain a unique prediction for the
one-loop correction to the spinning string energy.

reactions are important to correctly assess gas production in spallation
targets. In particular, the helium production yield is important for assessing
damage in the window separating the accelerator vacuum from a spallation
target, and tritium is a major contributor to the target radioactivity. Up to
now, the models available in the MCNPX transport code, including the widely
used default option Bertini-Dresner and the INCL4.2-ABLA combination of models,
were not able to correctly predict light charged particle yields. The work done
recently on both the intranuclear cascade model INCL4, in which cluster
emission through a coalescence process has been introduced, and on the
de-excitation model ABLA allows correcting these deficiencies. This paper shows
that the coalescence emission plays an important role in the tritium and $^3He$
production and that the combination of the newly developed versions of the
codes, INCL4.5-ABLA07, now lead to good predictions of both helium and tritium
cross sections over a wide incident energy range. Comparisons with other
available models are also presented.

that in the presence of Mottness the fundamental workings of quantum statistics
changes and we will elaborate on the effects of this Weng statistics with an
emphasis on characterizing these further using numerical methods. The pseudogap
physics of the underdoped regime appears as a consequence of the altered

quantum phase transition to the overdoped regime ruled by normal Fermi-Dirac
