supermassive black holes (BHs) that reside at the centres of virtually all
galaxies can halt or even reverse gas inflow, providing a natural mechanism for
supermassive BHs to regulate their growth and to couple their properties to
those of their host galaxies. However, it remains unclear whether this
self-regulation occurs on the scale at which the BH is gravitationally
dominant, on that of the stellar bulge, the galaxy, or that of the entire dark
matter halo. To answer this question, we use self-consistent simulations of the
co-evolution of the BH and galaxy populations that reproduce the observed
correlations between the masses of the BHs and the properties of their host
galaxies. We first confirm unambiguously that the BHs regulate their growth:
the amount of energy that the BHs inject into their surroundings remains
unchanged when the fraction of the accreted rest mass energy that is injected,
is varied by four orders of magnitude. The BHs simply adjust their masses so as
to inject the same amount of energy. We then use simulations with artificially
reduced star formation rates to demonstrate explicitly that BH mass is not set
by the stellar mass. Instead, we find that it is determined by the mass of the
dark matter halo with a secondary dependence on the halo concentration, of the
form that would be expected if the halo binding energy were the fundamental
property that controls the mass of the BH. We predict that the logarithmic
slope of the relation between dark matter halo mass and black hole mass is
1.55+/-0.05 and that the scatter around the mean relation in part reflects the
scatter in the halo concentration-mass relation.

the constrained minimization of the instantaneous ground state energy
functional rather than from their dynamical equations. To clarify the
motivation for this minimization condition, we discuss a sequence of adiabatic
energy functionals, each obeying a minimum principle. The performance of the
approximation vis-a`-vis nonadiabatic effects is assessed in real-time
simulations for a two-site Hubbard model. Due to the presence of
Landau-Zener-type transitions, the system evolves into a nonstationary state
with persistent oscillations in the observables. The amplitude and phase of the
oscillations exhibit resonance behavior both with respect to the strength of
the electron-electron interaction and the rate of variation of the external
potential. Both types of resonances have the same origin -- the interference of

terms in these equations using a simple phenomenology for the cascade and
dissipation of wave energy, and assume that there is much more energy in waves
propagating away from the Sun than waves propagating towards the Sun. We then
solve the equations analytically for waves with periods of hours and longer to
obtain expressions for the wave amplitudes and turbulent heating rate as a
function of heliocentric distance. We also develop a second approximate model
that includes waves with periods of roughly one minute to one hour, which
undergo less reflection than the longer-period waves, and compare our models to
observations. Our models generalize the phenomenological model of Dmitruk et al
by accounting for the solar wind velocity, so that the turbulent heating rate
can be evaluated from the coronal base out past the Alfven critical point -
that is, throughout the region in which most of the heating and acceleration
occurs. The simple analytical expressions that we obtain can be used to
incorporate Alfven-wave reflection and turbulent heating into fluid models of

counterpart. No evidence of active galactic nuclei activity or supernovae

projected equatorial velocities, combined with radii estimated from the cluster
distances and a surface brightness/colour relationship. For both clusters we
find no evidence for spin-axis alignment: lambda=90 degrees is the most

behavior in the ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) NGC 5408 X-1. An ~100 ksec
pointing with XMM/Newton obtained in January, 2008 reveals a strong 10 mHz QPO
in the > 1 keV flux, as well as flat-topped, band limited noise breaking to a
power law. The energy spectrum is again dominated by two components, a 0.16 keV
thermal disk and a power-law with an index of ~2.5. These new measurements,
combined with results from our previous January 2006 pointing in which we first
detected QPOs, show for the first time in a ULX a pattern of spectral and
temporal correlations strongly analogous to that seen in Galactic black hole
sources, but at much higher X-ray luminosity and longer characteristic
time-scales. We find that the QPO frequency is proportional to the inferred
disk flux, while the QPO and broad-band noise amplitude (root mean squared,
rms) are inversely proportional to the disk flux. Assuming that QPO frequency
scales inversely with black hole mass at a given power-law spectral index we
derive mass estimates using the observed QPO frequency - spectral index
relations from five stellar-mass black hole systems with dynamical mass
constraints. The results from all sources are consistent with a mass range for
NGC 5408 X-1 from 1000 - 9000 solar masses. Moreover, the recent relation from
Gierlinski et al. that relates black hole mass to the strength of variability
at high frequencies (above the break in the power spectrum) is also indicative
of such a high mass for NGC 5408 X-1. We argue that these new findings strongly
support the conclusion that NGC 5408 X-1 harbors an intermediate mass black
hole.

including the inspiral, merger and ringdown portions of the signals, we find
that LISA will have far greater precision than previous estimates for
nonspinning mergers that ignored the merger and ringdown. Our analysis covers
nonspinning waveforms with moderate mass ratios, q >= 1/10, and total masses
10^5 < M/M_{Sun} < 10^7. We compare the parameter uncertainties using the
Fisher matrix formalism, and establish the significance of mass asymmetry and
higher-order content to the predicted parameter uncertainties resulting from
inclusion of the merger. In real-time observations, the later parts of the
signal lead to significant improvements in sky-position precision in the last
hours and even the final minutes of observation. For comparable mass systems
with total mass M/M_{Sun} = ~10^6, we find that the increased precision
resulting from including the merger is comparable to the increase in
signal-to-noise ratio. For the most precise systems under investigation, half

circular polarisation signatures detected in photospheric lines can be
interpreted as caused by cool spots and magnetic regions at the surface of the
star. The large-scale field is of moderate strength and highly complex;
moreover, both the spot distribution and the magnetic field show significant
variability on a timescale of only one week, as a likely result of strong
differential rotation. Both properties make V2247Oph very different from the
(more massive) prototypical cTTS BPTau; we speculate that this difference
reflects the lower mass of V2247Oph.
  During our observations, V2247Oph was in a low-accretion state, with emission
lines showing only weak levels of circular polarisation; we nevertheless find
that excess emission apparently concentrates in a mid-latitude region of strong
radial field, suggesting that it is the footpoint of an accretion funnel.
  The weaker and more complex field that we report on V2247Oph may share
similarities with those of very-low-mass late-M dwarfs and potentially explain
why low-mass cTTSs rotate on average faster than intermediate mass ones. These
surprising results need confirmation from new independent data sets on V2247Oph
and other similar low-mass cTTSs.

arbitrary fading statistics is studied first, whose capacity region is
completely determined as a polygon. Each dominant rate pair can be regarded as
the outcome of a trade-off between the rate gain of the interference-free user
and the rate loss of the other user due to interference. Using insights from
the layered erasure model, inner and outer bounds of the capacity region are
provided for the one-sided fading Gaussian interference channels. In
particular, the inner bound is achieved by artificially creating layers in the
signaling of the interference-free user. The outer bound is developed by
characterizing a similar trade-off as in the erasure model by taking a
""layered"" view using the incremental channel approach. Furthermore, the gap
between the inner and outer bounds is no more than 12.772 bits per channel use
per user, regardless of the signal-to-noise ratios and fading statistics.

falsifiable approach. This is due to tremendous difficulties in data
acquisition of social systems. Massive multiplayer online games (MMOG) provide
a fascinating new way of observing hundreds of thousands of simultaneously
socially interacting individuals engaged in virtual economic activities. We
have compiled a data set consisting of practically all actions of all players
over a period of three years from a MMOG played by 300,000 people. This
large-scale data set of a socio-economic unit contains all social and economic
data from a single and coherent source. Players have to generate a virtual
income through economic activities to `survive' and are typically engaged in a
multitude of social activities offered within the game. Our analysis of
high-frequency log files focuses on three types of social networks, and tests a
series of social-dynamics hypotheses. In particular we study the structure and
dynamics of friend-, enemy- and communication networks. We find striking
differences in topological structure between positive (friend) and negative
(enemy) tie networks. All networks confirm the recently observed phenomenon of
network densification. We propose two approximate social laws in communication
networks, the first expressing betweenness centrality as the inverse square of
the overlap, the second relating communication strength to the cube of the
overlap. These empirical laws provide strong quantitative evidence for the Weak
ties hypothesis of Granovetter. Further, the analysis of triad significance
profiles validates well-established assertions from social balance theory. We
find overrepresentation (underrepresentation) of complete (incomplete) triads
in networks of positive ties, and vice versa for networks of negative ties...

constraining upper limits to neutrino fluxes from various source candidates are
reported. Thus, future neutrino telescopes, such as KM3NeT in the Mediterranean
should aim at volumes significantly larger than one cubic kilometer. Besides
seeking the sources of galactic and extragalactic cosmic rays, the new
generation of cosmic ray and neutrino observatories touches a wide range of
scientific issues and they have already provided important results on tests of

it is shown that the maximum entropy rate of an input process of a constrained

considers systems where the constraints define regular languages and uses
results from matrix theory in his derivations. In this work, the regularity
constraint is dropped. Using generating functions, it is shown that the maximum
entropy rate of an input process is upper-bounded by the combinatorial capacity

vertices and the subgraph has K vertices, the particle becomes localized on the
subgraph in O(N/K) steps. This leads to a quantum search that is quadratically
faster than a corresponding classical search. We show how to implement the

specify the resource needed for a quantitative comparison of the efficiency of

groups. Its first and next four ranked galaxies have magnitude differences in
the r band and projected distances which violate the optical criteria to
classify it as a fossil group. We confirm that the UGC 842 group is a fossil
group, but with about half the velocity dispersion that is reported in previous
works. The velocity distribution of its galaxies reveals the existence of two
structures in its line of sight, one with sigmaV ~ 223 km/s and another with
sigmaV ~ 235 km/s, with a difference in velocity of ~820 km/s. The main
structure is dominated by passive galaxies, while these represent ~60% of the
second structure. The X-ray temperature for the intragroup medium of a group
with such a velocity dispersion is expected to be kT ~0.5-1 keV, against the
observed value of kT ~1.9 keV reported in the literature. This result makes UGC
842 a special case among fossil groups because (1) it represents more likely
the interaction between two small groups, which warms the intragroup medium
and/or (2) it could constitute evidence that member galaxies lost energy in the
process of spiraling toward the group center, and decreased the velocity
dispersion of the system. As far as we know, UGC 842 is the first low-mass
fossil group studied in detail.

time, and many of those representations are lost forever. A lucky few manage to
reappear as archived resources that carry their own URIs. For example, some
content management systems maintain version pages that reflect a frozen prior
state of their changing resources. Archives recurrently crawl the web to obtain
the actual representation of resources, and subsequently make those available
via special-purpose archived resources. In both cases, the archival copies have
URIs that are protocol-wise disconnected from the URI of the resource of which
they represent a prior state. Indeed, the lack of temporal capabilities in the
most common Web protocol, HTTP, prevents getting to an archived resource on the
basis of the URI of its original. This turns accessing archived resources into
a significant discovery challenge for both human and software agents, which
typically involves following a multitude of links from the original to the
archival resource, or of searching archives for the original URI. This paper
proposes the protocol-based Memento solution to address this problem, and
describes a proof-of-concept experiment that includes major servers of archival
content, including Wikipedia and the Internet Archive. The Memento solution is
based on existing HTTP capabilities applied in a novel way to add the temporal

  and title changed accordingly",,,,"astro-ph.HE astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It has been claimed recently that Swift has captured for the first time a
late-time afterglow re-brightening of clear nonflaring origin after the steep
decay of the prompt emission in a long gamma-ray burst (GRB), which may have
been produced by a narrow jet viewed far off-axis. However, this interpretation
of the observed re-brightening of the X-ray afterglow (AG) of GRB081028 is
unlikely in view of its large equivalent isotropic gamma-ray energy. Moreover,
we show that the late-time re-brightening of the AG of GRB081028 is well
explained by the cannonball (CB) model of GRBs as a synchrotron flare emitted
when the jet that produced the GRB in a star formation region (SFR) in the host
galaxy crossed the SFR boundary into the interstellar medium or the halo of the
host galaxy. We also show that all the other observed properties of GRB081028
and its afterglow are well reproduced by the CB model. On the other hand, we
demonstrate that far-off axis GRBs, which in the CB model are `soft' GRBs and
XRFs and consequently have much smaller isotropic equivalent gamma-ray
energies, have slowly rising afterglows with a late-time power-law decay
identical to that of ordinary GRBs, in good agreement with the CB model
predictions.

offers new information about the Euclidean embedding dimension of P^m only for
m < 16. Concrete scenarios are described in these low-dimensional cases,
pinpointing where to look for potential, but critical, high-order obstructions
in the corresponding Taylor towers. For m > 15, the relation TC^S(P^m) > n-1 is
translated into the triviality of a certain cohomotopy Euler class which, in
turn, becomes the only Taylor obstruction to producing an n-dimensional
Euclidean embedding of P^m. A speculative bordism-type form of this primary
obstruction is proposed as an analogue of Davis' BP-approach to the immersion
problem of P^m. A form of the Euler class viewpoint is applied to show
TC^S(P^3) = 5, as well as to suggest a few higher dimensional projective spaces
for which the method could produce new information. As a second goal, the paper
extends Farber's work on the motion planning problem in order to develop the
notion of a symmetric motion planner for a mechanical system S. Following
Farber's lead, this concept is connected to the symmetric topological
complexity of the state space of S. The paper ends by sketching the
construction of a concrete 5-local-rules symmetric motion planner for P^3.

which can be inferred from the spin down of open cluster stars. The rotation
distribution inferred from rotation velocities and periods are consistent for
larger and more recent samples, but smaller samples of rotation periods appear
biased relative to vsini studies. We therefore focus on whether the rotation
period distributions observed in star forming regions can be evolved into the
observed ones in the Pleiades, NGC2516, M34, M35, M37, and M50 with plausible
assumptions about star-disk coupling and angular momentum loss from magnetized
solar-like winds. Solid body models are consistent with the data for low mass
fully convective stars but highly inconsistent for higher mass stars where the
surface convection zone can decouple for angular momentum purposes from the
radiative interior. The Tayler-Spruit magnetic angular momentum transport
mechanism, commonly employed in models of high mass stars, predicts solid-body
rotation on extremely short timescales and is therefore unlikely to operate in
solar-type pre-MS and MS stars at the predicted rate. Models with core-envelope
decoupling can explain the spin down of 1.0 and 0.8 solar mass slow rotators
with characteristic coupling timescales of 55+-25 Myr and 175+-25 Myr
respectively. The upper envelope of the rotation distribution is more strongly
coupled than the lower envelope of the rotation distribution, in accord with
theoretical predictions that the angular momentum transport timescale should be
shorter for more rapidly rotating stars. Constraints imposed by the solar
rotation curve are also discussed (Abridged)

results are obtained which are closely analogous to those recently found for a
magnetodielectric wedge, with the same speed of light on both sides of the

radial semitransparent potentials, based on reduced Green's functions for the
angular dependence, which allows calculations using the multiple-scattering

are likewise computed, which generalize those for the wedge geometry. Generally
useful formulas for calculating Casimir energies in separable geometries are

galaxies. The calculation is embedded in the GALFORM semi-analytical model
which simulates the formation and evolution of galaxies in a cold dark matter
(CDM) universe. During the evolution of the host galaxy, hot and cold gas are
added to the SMBH by flows triggered by halo gas cooling, disc instabilities
and galaxy mergers. This builds up the mass and spin of the BH, and the
resulting accretion power regulates the gas cooling and subsequent star
formation. The accretion flow is assumed to form a geometrically thin cool disc
when the accretion rate exceeds 0.01\dot{M}_Edd, and a geometrically thick,
radiatively inefficient hot flow when the accretion rate falls below this
value. The resulting quasar optical luminosity function matches observations
very well, and the mass of the SMBH correlates with the mass of the galaxy
bulge as observed. The BH spin distribution depends strongly on whether the gas
in any given accretion episode remains in the same plane (prolonged accretion)
or whether, due to self-gravity, it fragments into multiple, randomly aligned
accretion episodes (chaotic accretion). In the chaotic accretion model there is
a clear correlation of spin with SMBH mass. Massive BHs (M>5\times10^8\Msun)
are hosted by giant elliptical galaxies and are rapidly spinning, while lower
mass BHs are hosted in spiral galaxies and have much lower spin. Using the
Blandford-Znajek mechanism for jet production to calculate the jet power, our
model is able to reproduce the radio loudness of radio galaxies, LINERS and
Seyferts. This is the first confirmation that a CDM galaxy formation model can
reproduce the observed phenomenology of AGN.

in cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations using methods based on identifying
self bound, locally over dense substructures. However, distinguishing the
central galaxy from the stellar diffuse component within clusters is
notoriously difficult, and in the center it is not even clear if two distinct
stellar populations exist. Here, after subtracting all member galaxies, we use
the velocity distribution of the remaining stars and detect two dynamically,
well-distinct stellar components within simulated galaxy clusters. These
differences in the dynamics can be used to apply an un-binding procedure which
leads to a spatial separation of the two components into a cD and a diffuse
stellar component (DSC). Applying our new algorithm to a cosmological,
hydrodynamical simulation we find that -- in line with previous studies --
these two components have clearly distinguished spatial and velocity
distributions as well as different star formation histories. We show that the
DSC fraction -- which can broadly be associated with the observed intra cluster
light -- does not depend on the virial mass of the galaxy cluster and is much
more sensitive to the formation history of the cluster. We conclude that the
separation of the cD and the DSC in simulations, based on our dynamical
criteria, is more physically motivated than current methods which depend on
implicit assumptions on a length scale associated with the cD galaxy and
therefore represent a step forward in understanding the different stellar
components within galaxy clusters. Our results also show the importance of
analyzing the dynamics of the DSC to characterize its properties and understand
its origin.

galaxies, merger-induced bursts, and obscured AGN, to IR luminosity functions
(LFs) and global SFR densities. We use empirical halo occupation constraints to
populate halos with galaxies and determine the distribution of normal and
merging galaxies. Each system can then be associated with high-resolution
hydrodynamic simulations. We predict the distribution of observed luminosities
and SFRs, from different galaxy classes, as a function of redshift from z=0-6.
We provide fitting functions for the predicted LFs, quantify the uncertainties,
and compare with observations. At all redshifts, 'normal' galaxies dominate the
LF at moderate luminosities ~L* (the 'knee'). Merger-induced bursts
increasingly dominate at L>>L*; at the most extreme luminosities, AGN are
important. However, all populations increase in luminosity at higher redshifts,
owing to increasing gas fractions. Thus the 'transition' between normal and
merger-dominated sources increases from the LIRG-ULIRG threshold at z~0 to
bright Hyper-LIRG thresholds at z~2. The transition to dominance by obscured
AGN evolves similarly, at factor of several higher L_IR. At all redshifts,
non-merging systems dominate the total luminosity/SFR density, with
merger-induced bursts constituting ~5-10% and AGN ~1-5%. Bursts contribute
little to scatter in the SFR-stellar mass relation. In fact, many systems
identified as 'ongoing' mergers will be forming stars in their 'normal'
(non-burst) mode. Counting this as 'merger-induced' star formation leads to a
stronger apparent redshift evolution in the contribution of mergers to the SFR
density.

bilayer system of itinerant electron magnets. The model studied consists of the
first layer subjected to an inplane current and open to an external substrate.
The second layer is closed and subject to no direct external drive, but couples
to the first layer via short-ranged spin exchange interaction. No particle
exchange is assumed between the layers. Starting from a microscopic fermionic
model, we derive an effective action in terms of two coupled bosonic fields
which are related to the magnetization fluctuations of the two layers. When
there is no interlayer coupling, the two bosonic modes possess different
dynamical critical exponents z with z=2 (z=3) for the first (second) layer.
This results in multi-scale quantum criticality in the coupled system. It is
shown that the linear coupling between the two fields leads to a low energy
fixed point characterized by the larger dynamical critical exponent z=3. The
perturbative renormalization group is used to compute the correlation length in
the quantum disordered and quantum critical regimes. We also derive the
stochastic dynamics obeyed by the critical fluctuations in the quantum critical
regime. Comparing the nonequilibrium situation to the thermal equilibrium
scenario, where the whole system is at a temperature T, we find that the
nonequilibrium drive does not always play the role of temperature.

Galactic Center, we revist the problem of a binary disruption by a passage near
a much more massive point mass. The six order of magnitude mass ratio between
the Galactic Center black hole and the binary stars allows us to formulate the
problem in the restricted parabolic three-body approximation. In this
framework, results can be simply rescaled in terms of binary masses, its
initial separation and binary-to-black hole mass ratio. Consequently, an
advantage over the full three-body calculation is that a much smaller set of
simulations is needed to explore the relevant parameter space. Contrary to
previous claims, we show that, upon binary disruption, the lighter star does
not remain preferentially bound to the black hole. In fact, it is ejected
exactly in 50% of the cases. Nonetheless, lighter objects have higher ejection
velocities, since the energy distribution is independent of mass. Focusing on
the planar case, we provide the probability distributions for disruption of
circular binaries and for the ejection energy. We show that even binaries that
penetrate deeply into the tidal sphere of the black hole are not doomed to
disruption, but survive in 20% of the cases. Nor do these deep encounters
produce the highest ejection energies, which are instead obtained for binaries
arriving to 0.1-0.5 of the tidal radius in a prograde orbit. Interestingly,
such deep-reaching binaries separate widely after penetrating the tidal radius,
but always approach each other again on their way out from the black

that combines the pre-polarization technique and broadband signal reception by
SQUID sensors to enable in vivo MRI at microtesla-range magnetic fields.
Despite significant advances, the potential of microtesla MRI for biomedical
imaging is limited by its insufficient signal-to-noise ratio due to a
relatively low sample polarization. Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) is a
widely used approach that allows polarization enhancement by two-four orders of
magnitude without an increase in the polarizing field strength. In this work,
the first implementation of microtesla MRI with Overhauser DNP and SQUID signal
detection is described. The first measurements of carbon-13 NMR spectra at
microtesla fields are also reported. The experiments were performed at the
measurement field of 96 microtesla with Overhauser enhancement at 3.5 - 5.7 mT
field. The Overhauser DNP enabled nuclear polarization enhancement by factor as
high as -95 for protons and as high as -200 for carbon-13, corresponding to
thermal polarizations at 0.33 T and 1.1 T fields, respectively. These results
demonstrate that SQUID-based microtesla MRI can be naturally combined with
Overhauser DNP in one system, and that its signal-to-noise performance is
greatly improved in this case. They also suggest that microtesla MRI can become
an efficient tool for in vivo imaging of hyperpolarized carbon-13, produced by
the low-temperature dissolution DNP.

with $L \propto T^{4}$ is clearly detected in all eight sources, down to
$\approx5\times10^{-4}L_{Edd}$. In six sources, disk models exclude a
truncation radius larger than 10rg. Iron-ka fluorescence line emission is
observed in half of the sample, down to luminosities of

truncated disk in each case. If strong evidence of truncation is defined as (1)
a non-detection of a broad iron line, {\it and} (2) an inner disk temperature
much cooler than expected from the ${\rm L} \propto {\rm T}^{4}$ relation, none
of the spectra in this sample offer strong evidence of disk truncation. This

two variables which is based on the idea that an effect never occurs before its
cause. Later, Geweke has generalized this concept to a multivariate Granger
causality, i.e., n variables Granger-cause another variable. Although Granger
causality is not ""effective causality"", this concept is useful to infer
directionality and information flow in observational data. Granger causality is
usually identified by using VAR models due to their simplicity. In the last few
years, several VAR-based models were presented in order to model gene
regulatory networks. Here, we generalize the multivariate Granger causality
concept in order to identify Granger causalities between sets of gene
expressions, i.e., whether a set of n genes Granger-causes another set of m
genes, aiming at identifying and quantifying the flow of information between
gene networks (or pathways). The concept of Granger causality for sets of
variables is presented. Moreover, a method for its identification with a
bootstrap test is proposed. This method is applied in simulated and also in
actual biological gene expression data in order to model regulatory networks.
This concept may be useful to understand the complete information flow from one
network or pathway to the other, mainly in regulatory networks. Linking this
concept to graph theory, sink and source can be generalized to node sets.
Moreover, hub and centrality for sets of genes can be defined based on total
information flow. Another application is in annotation, when the functionality
of a set of genes is unknown, but this set is Granger caused by another set of
genes which is well studied. Therefore, this information may be useful to infer
or construct some hypothesis about the unknown set of genes.

the mass circulations around the sunspot are clearly resolved. Below the
sunspot, some organized divergent flow cells are observed, and these structures
may indicate the existence of mesoscale convective motions. Near the light
bridge inside the sunspot, hotter plasma is found beneath, and flows divergent
from this area are observed. The Hinode data also allow us to investigate
potential uncertainties caused by the use of phase-speed filter for short
travel distances. Comparing the measurements with and without the phase-speed
filtering, we find out that inside the sunspot, mean acoustic travel times are
in basic agreement, but the values are underestimated by a factor of 20-40%

curvatures: the Riemann curvature, the commutator curvature and the potential.
In the case of effective action, this is equivalent to a calculation (in the
covariant form) of the one-loop vertices in all models of gravitating fields.
The basis of nonlocal invariants of third order in the curvature is built, and
constraints arising between these invariants in low-dimensional manifolds are
obtained. All third-order form factors in the heat kernel and effective action
are calculated, and several integral representations for them are obtained. In
the case of effective action, this includes a specially generalized spectral
representation used in applications to the expectation-value equations. The
results for the heat kernel are checked by deriving all the known coefficients
of the Schwinger-DeWitt expansion including $a_3$ and the cubic terms of $a_4$.
The results for the effective action are checked by deriving the trace anomaly
in two and four dimensions. In four dimensions, this derivation is carried out
by several different techniques elucidating the mechanism by which the local
anomaly emerges from the nonlocal action. In two dimensions, it is shown by a
direct calculation that the series for the effective action terminates at
second order in the curvature. The asymptotic behaviours of the form factors
are calculated including the late-time behaviour in the heat kernel and the
small-$\Box$ behaviour in the effective action. In quantum gravity, the latter
behaviour contains the effects of vacuum radiation including the Hawking

that the low-lying long-wavelength fluctuations around the backgrounds are in

that Fe II/Hbeta increases as L/L_Edd increases. We show that the ""force

central object if the radiation force is able to act on the entire cloud. As
had previously been deduced, infall requires that the clouds have large column
densities so that a substantial amount of shielded gas is present. The critical
column density required for infall to occur depends on L/L_Edd, establishing a
link between Eigenvector 1 and the Fe II/Hbeta ratio. We see predominantly the
shielded face of the infalling clouds rather than the symmetric distribution of
emitters that has been assumed. The Fe II spectrum emitted by the shielded face
is in good agreement with observations thus solving several long-standing
mysteries in quasar emission lines.

multi-armed bandit problem by assuming one is given side information consisting
of a priori upper bounds on the difference in expected payoff between certain
pairs of strategies. Classical results of (Lai and Robbins 1985) and (Auer et
al. 2002) imply a logarithmic regret bound for the Lipschitz MAB problem on
finite metric spaces. Recent results on continuum-armed bandit problems and
their generalizations imply lower bounds of $\sqrt{t}$, or stronger, for many
infinite metric spaces such as the unit interval. Is this dichotomy universal?
We prove that the answer is yes: for every metric space, the optimal regret of
a Lipschitz MAB algorithm is either bounded above by any $f\in \omega(\log t)$,
or bounded below by any $g\in o(\sqrt{t})$. Perhaps surprisingly, this
dichotomy does not coincide with the distinction between finite and infinite
metric spaces; instead it depends on whether the completion of the metric space
is compact and countable. Our proof connects upper and lower bound techniques
in online learning with classical topological notions such as perfect sets and
the Cantor-Bendixson theorem. Among many other results, we show a similar
dichotomy for the ""full-feedback"" (a.k.a., ""best-expert"") version.

the cosmological constant, the spacetime is uniquely given by the Kottler
(Schwarzschild-(anti) de Sitter) solution for the entirely vacuum spacetime.

hyperbolic universes are uniquely admissible for the locally empty region, for
the positive and negative cosmological constants, respectively, if its
nonvanishing contribution to the global Hamiltonian constraint can be
compensated by that from the nonempty or nonstatic region. This implies that
static spherically symmetric entirely vacuum solutions would not admit the
freedom to reproduce the observed flat rotation curves of galaxies. On the
other hand, the result for locally empty regions implies that the IR limit of
nonrelativistic quantum gravity theories does not simply recover general
relativity but includes it.

quasi-steady state that persists for a number of free-fall times and in which
most of the mass within 100 au is located inside 10-20 au. This pile-up of mass
in the inner disc could result in temperatures that are high enough for the
growth of MHD turbulence which could rapidly drain the inner disc and lead to
FU Orionis-like outbursts. In all our simulations, the inner regions of the
discs (r < 40 au) were stable against fragmentation, while fragmentation was
possible in the outer regions (r > 40 au) of discs that formed from cores that
had enough initial angular momentum to deposit sufficient mass in these outer
regions. The large amounts of mass in these outer regions, however, suggests
that fragmentation will lead to the formation of sub-stellar and stellar mass
companions, rather than planetary mass objects. Although mass accretion rates
were largely consistent with observations, the large disc masses suggest that
an additional transport mechanism (such as MRI occuring in the upper layers of
the disc) must operate in order to drain the remaining disc material within

matter field F-term as a source of supersymmetry breaking and uplifting. Two
models of F-term supersymmetry breaking are considered: the Polonyi model and
the quantum corrected O'Raifeartaigh model. In the former case, both classes of
racetrack inflation models differ significantly from the corresponding models

dominance of the inflaton by the matter field. In addition, fine-tuning of the

of the racetrack inflation models coupled to the O'Raifeartaigh model, the

of the above models the gravitino mass is larger than the Hubble scale during

nonlinearity and periodic time dependence, that is, the periodically driven
overdamped pendulum. The problem is studied in the case that the explicit
time-dependence has symmetries common to pure ac-driven systems. The only
bifurcation that exists in the system is a degenerate pitchfork bifurcation,
which describes an exchange of stability between two symmetric nonlinear modes.
Using a type of Prufer transform to a pair of linear differential equations, we
derive an approximate condition of the bifurcation. This approximation is in
very good agreement with our numerical data. In particular, it works well in
the limit of large drive amplitudes and low external frequencies. We
demonstrate the usefulness of the theory applying it to the models of pure
ac-driven semiconductor superlattices and Josephson junctions. We show how the
knowledge of bifurcations in the overdamped pendulum model can be utilized to
describe effects of rectification and amplification of electric fields in these

two gapped paramagnetic phases (a rung-singlet and a Haldane-like

to collective flavor oscillations resulting in swap between flavors. These
oscillations depend on the initial energy spectra, and relative fluxes or
relative luminosities of the neutrinos. It has been observed that departure
from energy equipartition among different flavors can give rise to one or more
sharp spectral swap over energy, termed as splits. We study the occurrence of
splits in the neutrino and antineutrino spectra, varying the initial relative
fluxes for different models of initial energy spectrum, in both normal and
inverted hierarchy. These initial relative flux variations give rise to several
possible split patterns whereas variation over different models of energy
spectra give similar results. We explore the effect of these spectral splits on
the electron fraction, $Y_e$, that governs r-process nucleosynthesis inside
supernovae. Since spectral splits modify the electron neutrino and antineutrino
spectra in the region where r-process is postulated to happen, and since the
pattern of spectral splits depends on the initial conditions of the spectra and
the neutrino mass hierarchy, we show that the condition $Y_e < 0.5$ required
for successful r-process nucleosynthesis will lead to constraints on the
initial spectral conditions, for a given neutrino mass hierarchy.

molecular clouds can lead to a situation where deuterated forms of H_3^+ are
the most useful spectroscopic probes of the physical conditions.
  Aims: The aim is to predict the observability of the rotational lines of
H_2D^+ and D_2H^+ from prestellar cores.
  Methods: Recently derived rate coefficients for the H_3^+ + H_2 isotopic
system were applied to the ""complete depletion"" reaction scheme to calculate
abundance profiles in hydrostatic core models. The ground-state lines of
H_2D^+(o) (372 GHz) and D_2H^+(p) (692 GHz) arising from these cores were
simulated. The excitation of the rotational levels of these molecules was
approximated by using the state-to-state coefficients for collisions with H_2.
We also predicted line profiles from cores with a power-law density
distribution advocated in some previous studies.
  Results: The new rate coefficients introduce some changes to the complete
depletion model, but do not alter the general tendencies. One of the
modifications with respect to the previous results is the increase of the D_3^+
abundance at the cost of other isotopologues. Furthermore, the present model
predicts a lower H_2D^+ (o/p) ratio, and a slightly higher D_2H^+ (p/o) ratio
in very cold, dense cores, as compared with previous modelling results. These
nuclear spin ratios affect the detectability of the submm lines of H_2D^+(o)
and D_2H^+(p). The previously detected H_2D^+ and D_2H^+ lines towards the core
I16293E, and the H_2D^+ line observed towards Oph D can be reproduced using the
present excitation model and the physical models suggested in the original
papers.

  The findings of the current study indeed validate the 2004 study's main

complexity is (still) positively correlated with the number of detected risk

functions at some generalized degrees of freedom, such as average values on
edges or faces of subdomains. We revisit existing algorithms for selection of

minimal set of assumptions (namely to specify a metric) and does not rely on
the dynamical equations for gravity. On the data side, we consider the most
recent compilations of Supernovae and Gamma Ray Bursts catalogues. This allows
to further extend the cosmographic fit up to $z = 6.6$, i.e. up to redshift for
which one could start to resolve the low z degeneracy among competing
cosmological models. In order to reliably control the cosmographic approach at
high redshifts, we adopt the expansion in the improved parameter $y = z/(1+z)$.
This series has the great advantage to hold also for $z > 1$ and hence it is
the appropriate tool for handling data including non-nearby distance
indicators. We find that Gamma Ray Bursts, probing higher redshifts than
Supernovae, have constraining power and do require (and statistically allow) a
cosmographic expansion at higher order than Supernovae alone. Exploiting the
set of data from Union and GRBs catalogues, we show (for the first time in a
purely cosmographic approach parametrized by deceleration $q_0$, jerk $j_0$,

Subaru low resolution optical spectrograph, FOCAS. These SNe were found in SN
surveys with Suprime-Cam on Subaru, the CFH12k camera on the
Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), and the Advanced Camera for Surveys
(ACS) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). These SN surveys specifically
targeted z>1 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). From the spectra of 39 candidates, we
obtain redshifts for 32 candidates and spectroscopically identify 7 active
candidates as probable SNe Ia, including one at z=1.35, which is the most
distant SN Ia to be spectroscopically confirmed with a ground-based telescope.
An additional 4 candidates are identified as likely SNe Ia from the
spectrophotometric properties of their host galaxies. Seven candidates are not
SNe Ia, either being SNe of another type or active galactic nuclei. When SNe Ia
are observed within a week of maximum light, we find that we can
spectroscopically identify most of them up to z=1.1. Beyond this redshift, very
few candidates were spectroscopically identified as SNe Ia. The current
generation of super red-sensitive, fringe-free CCDs will push this redshift
limit higher.

importantly, I investigate the physical reason behind the good agreement

the fact that my formula takes into account the post-Newtonian precession of

single/compact to clumpy/extended) that is different from typical local
star-forming galaxies. Recently, we have introduced a sample of rare, nearby
(z<0.3) starbursts that appear to be good analogs of LBGs. These ""Lyman Break
Analogs"" (LBAs) provide an excellent training set for understanding starbursts
at different redshifts. We present an application of this by comparing the
rest-frame UV/optical morphologies of 30 LBAs with those of sBzK galaxies at
z~2, and LBGs at z~3-4 in the HUDF. The UV/optical colors and sizes of LBAs and
LBGs are very similar, while the BzK galaxies are somewhat redder and larger.
There is significant overlap between the morphologies (G, C, A and M_20) of the
local and high-z samples, although the latter are somewhat less concentrated
and clumpier. We find that in the majority of LBAs the starbursts appear to be
triggered by interactions/mergers. When the images of the LBAs are degraded to
the same sensitivity and resolution as the images of LBGs and BzK galaxies,
these relatively faint asymmetric features are no longer detectable. This
effect is particularly severe in the rest-frame UV. It has been suggested that
high-z galaxies experience intense bursts unlike anything seen locally,
possibly due to cold flows and instabilities. In part, this is based on the
fact that the majority (~70%) of LBGs do not show morphological signatures of
mergers. Our results suggest that this evidence is insufficient, since a large
fraction of such signatures would likely have been missed in current
observations of z>2 galaxies. This leaves open the possibility that clumpy
accretion and mergers remain important in driving the evolution of these
starbursts, together with rapid gas accretion through other means.

large set (> 10^5) of non-analytical, theoretical spectra, each of these
defined by multiple parameters. We describe the construction of an
N-dimensional grid which is suitable for generating such spectra. The
theoretical spectra are designed to correspond to a targeted parameter grid but
otherwise to random positions in the parameter space, and they are interpolated
on-the-fly through a pre-calculated grid of spectra. The initial grid is
designed to be relatively low in parameter resolution and small in occupied
hard disk space and therefore can be updated efficiently when a new model is
desired. In a pilot study of stellar population synthesis of galaxies, the mean
square errors on the estimated parameters are found to decrease with the
targeted grid resolution. This scheme of generating a large model grid is
general for other areas of studies, particularly if they are based on
multi-dimensional parameter space and are focused on contrasting model
differences.

Accurate reactive probabilities and rate coefficients are obtained by solving
the Schrodinger equation for the motion of the three nuclei on a single
Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface (PES) and using a coupled-channel
hyperspherical coordinate method. Our new rates indeed confirm earlier,
qualitative predictions and some previous theoretical calculations, as
discussed in the main text. In the astrophysical domain we find that the
depletion process largely dominates for redshift (z) between 400 and 100, a
range significant for early Universe models. This new result from
first-principle calculations leads us to definitively surmise that LiH should
be already destroyed when the survival processes become important. Because of
this very rapid depletion reaction, the fractional abundance of LiH is found to
be drastically reduced, so that it should be very difficult to manage to
observe it as an imprinted species in the cosmic background radiation (CBR).
The present findings appear to settle the question of LiH observability in the
early Universe. We further report several state-to-state computed reaction
rates in the same range of temperatures of interest for the present problem.
