examined in both high and low temperature regimes. At low temperatures,
compelling evidence is found for two distinct equilibrium states related by a
spontaneously broken discrete R-symmetry. These equilibrium states exist
because the quantum moduli space of the theory has two singular points where
extra massless states appear. At high temperature, a unique
R-symmetry-preserving equilibrium state is found. Discrepancies with previous
results in the literature are explained.

the number of helical edge states in ultrathin film semiconductors without a

undergoes a transition from a topological trivial insulating state into a
non-trivial one with helical edge states emerging in the band gap. Further
study demonstrates that the number of helical edge state can be modulated by
the amplitude and the geometry of the electric potential in a step-wise
fashion, which is analogous to tuning the integer quantum Hall conductance by a
megntic field. We address the feasibility of experimental measurement of this

defined in terms of a twisted derivation $D$ satisfying $D(AB)=D(A)+\sigma(A)B$
where $\sigma$ is a homomorphism. Such twisted derivations include regular
derivations, difference and $q$-difference operators and superderivatives as
special cases. Remarkably, the formulae for the iteration of Darboux
transformations are identical with those in the standard case of a regular
derivation and are expressed in terms of quasideterminants. As an example, we
revisit the Darboux transformations for the Manin-Radul super KdV equation,
studied in Q.P. Liu and M. Ma\~nas, Physics Letters B \textbf{396} 133--140,
(1997). The new approach we take enables us to derive a unified expression for
solution formulae in terms of quasideterminants, covering all cases at once,
rather than using several subcases. Then, by using a known relationship between
quasideterminants and superdeterminants, we obtain expressions for these
solutions as ratios of superdeterminants. This coincides with the results of
Liu and Ma\~nas in all the cases they considered but also deals with the one
subcase in which they did not obtain such an expression. Finally, we obtain
another type of quasideterminant solutions to the Main-Radul super KdV equation
constructed from its binary Darboux transformations. These can also be
expressed as ratios of superdeterminants and are a substantial generalization
of the solutions constructed using binary Darboux transformations in earlier
work on this topic.

The problem is known to be of likely exponential complexity. Stated as the
partition function $Z$ of a graphical model, the problem allows exact Loop
Calculus representation [Chertkov, Chernyak '06] in terms of an interior

correspondent to a fixed point of the iterative message-passing algorithm of
the Belief Propagation (BP) type. Our main result is an explicit expression of

marginals, $\beta$, as $Z=\mbox{Perm}(P)=Z_{BP}
\mbox{Perm}(\beta_i^j(1-\beta_i^j))/\prod_{i,j}(1-\beta_i^j)$, where $Z_{BP}$

the Loop Calculus approaches. Assuming that the matrix $\beta$ of the Belief

upper-bound to estimate the multiplicative term. Two complementary lower bounds

of the characteristic function of the output state. This indicates that
teleportation is a noisy process that alters, to some extent, the input state.
Teleportation with a two-mode Gaussian EPR state can be described in terms of
the superposition of a distorting field with the input one. Here we analyze the
one-mode Gaussian distorting-field state. Some of its most important properties
are determined by the statistics of a positive EPR operator in the two-mode
Gaussian resource state. We finally examine the fidelity of teleportation of a

In a self-organizing system, interactions between dimensions or subsystems will
unintentionally give rise to anticipations that are properly aligned. The
potential reduction of uncertainty can be measured as negative entropy in the
mutual information among three (or more) dimensions. For a knowledge-based
economy, three dimensions can be considered as key: the distribution of firm
sizes, the geographical locations, and the technological classifications of
firms. Based on statistics of these three dimensions and drawing on a unique
dataset of all Dutch firms registered with the Chambers of Commerce, we are
able to refine well-known empirical findings for the geographical dimension.
Counter-intuitive, however, are our empirical findings for the dimension of
technology. Knowledge diffusion through medium-tech industry is much more
important for a localized economy than knowledge creation in high-tech
industry. Knowledge-intensive services tend to uncouple economic activities
from the regional dimension.

Preheating is driven by a complex process in which perturbative and
non-perturbative effects occur simultaneously. The Higgs field, initially an
oscillating coherent condensate, produces non-perturbatively W and Z gauge
fields. These decay very rapidly into fermions, thus preventing gauge bosons to
accumulate and, consequently, blocking the usual parametric resonance. The
energy transferred into the fermionic species is, nevertheless, not enough to
reheat the Universe, and resonant effects are eventually developed. Soon after
resonance becomes effective, also backreaction from the gauge bosons into the
Higgs condensate becomes relevant. We have determined the time evolution of the
energy distribution among the remnant Higgs condensate and the non-thermal
distribution of the SM fermions and gauge fields, until the moment in which
backreaction becomes important. Beyond backreaction our approximations break
down and numerical simulations and theoretical considerations beyond this work
are required, in order to study the evolution of the system until
thermalization.

modelling based on physical properties of particles such as size, density and
electrostatic forces between particles. The second approach uses image analysis

suggestion is made to use line-intercept sampling combined with Markov Chain

\partial_t\bdB - {curl} (\bU\times\bdB) = - \bnabla\big[qQ'(q) {div}

investigate the effects of a mixed population with distinctive relinking
preferences on both the convergence time and the network structures. It has
been found that a heterogeneous network structure is easier to be reached with
more high-degree-preferential(HDP) nodes. There exists high correlation between
the convergence time and the network heterogeneity. The heterogeneous degree
distribution caused by preferential attachment accelerates the convergence to a
consensus state and the shortened convergence time inhibits the occurrence of
the following disquieting situation that occurs in a continuously evolving
network: with preferential attachment and long-time evolvement, most of the
nodes would become separated and only a few leaders would have immediate
neighbors. Analytical calculations based on mean field theory reveal that both
the transition point ptr and the consensus time tc depend upon the standard
deviation of the degree distribution.ptr increases while tc decreases with the
rise of it.Functions of ptr and tc are found.Theoretical analyses are in

Submitted to ApJ",,,,"astro-ph.SR astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the dynamical evolution of the young star cluster Arches and its
dependence on the assumed initial stellar mass function (IMF). We perform many
direct $N$-body simulations with various initial conditions and two different
choices of IMFs. One is a standard Kroupa IMF without any mass segregation. The
other is a radially dependent IMF, as presently observed in the Arches. We find
that it is unlikely for the Arches to have attained the observed degree of mass
segregation at its current age starting from a standard non-segregated Kroupa
IMF. We also study the possibility of a collisional runaway developing in the
first $\sim 2-3 \rm{Myr}$ of dynamical evolution. We find that the evolution of
this cluster is dramatically different depending on the choice of IMF: if a
primordially mass segregated IMF is chosen, a collisional runaway should always
occur between $2-3 \rm{Myr}$ for a broad range of initial concentrations. In
contrast, for a standard Kroupa IMF no collisional runaway is predicted. We
argue that if Arches was created with a mass segregated IMF similar to what is
observed today then at the current cluster age a very unusual, high-mass star
should be created. However, whether a collisional runaway leads to the
formation of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) depends strongly on the
mass loss rate via winds from massive stars. Growth of stellar mass through
collisions can be quenched by strong wind mass loss. In that case, the
inter-cluster as well as intra-cluster medium are expected to have a
significant Helium enrichment which may be observed via Helium recombination
lines. The excess amount of gas lost in winds may also be observed via X-ray
observations as diffused X-ray sources.

temperature of $\sim$ 0.6 keV was found to be constant at all phases of both

radiation-driven outflows. The hot components in these binaries were found to
be phase dependent. They varied from 1.85 to 9.61 keV for V444 Cyg and from
1.63 to 4.27 keV for CD Cru. The absorption of the hard component varied with

capacity of download/upload streams, and quality of content served. Users are
consumers and servers at the same time in such networks, and often exhibit
behavior that is unfavorable towards maximization of social benefits.
Traditionally, network designers have overcome this difficulty by building-in
traffic latencies. However, using simulations, we show that appropriate pricing
schemes and usage terms can enable designers to limit required traffic
latencies, and be able to earn nearly 30% extra revenue from providing P2PTV
services. The service provider adjusts the prices of individual programs
incrementally within rounds, while making relatively large-scale adjustments at
the end of each round. Through simulations, we show that it is most beneficial
for the service provider to carry out 5 such rounds of price adjustments for
maximizing his average profit and minimizing the associated standard deviation
at the same time.

2009). The origin of such extended emission (found in about a quarter of Swift
short GRBs) is still unclear and may provide some clues to the identity of the
elusive progenitors of short GRBs. The extended emission from GRB 080503 is
followed by a rapid decay phase (RDP) that is detected over an unusually large
dynamical range (one decade in time and ~3.5 decades in flux). We model the
broad envelope of extended emission and the subsequent RDP using a physical
model (Genet & Granot 2009), in which the prompt emission (and its tail) is the
sum of its individual pulses (and their tails). For GRB 080503, a single pulse
fit is found to be unacceptable. The RDP displays very strong spectral
evolution and shows some evidence for the presence of two spectral components
with different temporal behaviour, likely arising from distinct physical
regions. A two pulse fit provides a much better fit to the data. The shallow
gamma-ray and steep hard X-ray decays are hard to account for simultaneously,
and require the second pulse to deviate from the simplest version of the model
we use. Therefore, while high latitude emission is a viable explanation for the
RDP in GRB080503, it is quite plausible that another mechanism is at work here.
Finally, we note that the properties of the RDP following the extended emission
of short GRBs appear to have different properties than that following the
prompt emission of long GRBs. However, a larger sample of short GRBs with
extended emission is required before any strong conclusion can be drawn.

rapid growth of 3G have heralded an era that will require researchers to find
reliable and easily implement-able solutions to the problem of poor TCP
performance in the wireless environment. Since a large part of the Internet is
TCP-based, solving this problem will be instrumental in determining if the move
from wired to wireless will be seamless or not. This paper proposes a scheme
that uses the base station's ability to predict the time at which the link may
be going down and to estimate the period for which the mobile would be
unreachable due to conditions like fading. By using cross-layer and ACK pacing
algorithms, the base station prevents the fixed host from timing out while
waiting for ACKs from the mobile. This in turn prevents TCP on the fixed host
from bringing down the throughput drastically due to temporary network
conditions, caused by mobility or the unreliability of wireless links.
Experimental results indicate a reasonable increase in throughput when the ACK
holding scheme is used.

configurations is introduced as a new method for hybrid-mode spectroscopy.
Polarization conversion in reflection appears when hybrid-modes are excited in
a guiding structure composed of at least one anisotropic media. In contrast to
a dark dip, in this case modes are associated to a peak in the converted
reflectance spectrum, increasing the detection sensitivity and avoiding
confusion with reflection dips associated with other processes as can be
transmission.

Accepted for publication in PASJ",,"10.1093/pasj/61.6.1399",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Variations of frequency separations of low-degree p-modes are studied over
the solar activity cycle. The separations studied are obtained from the
frequencies of low-degree p-modes of the Global Oscillation Network Group
(GONG). 10.7 cm radio flux is used as an index of solar activity. Small
separations of the p-mode frequencies are considered to be mainly dependent on
the conditions in stellar interiors. Thus they could be applied to diagnose the
changes in the stellar interior. Our calculation results show that the
magnitudes of variations of the mean large separations are less than 1 $\sigma$
over the solar activity cycle. Small separations show different behaviors in
the ascending and descending phases of activity. In the ascending phase,
variations of the small separations are less than 1 $\sigma$. However, the
small separations have systematic shifts during 2004 - 2007. The shifts are
roughly 1 $\sigma$ or more. The variations of the ratios of the small to large
separations with time are similar to the changes of the small separations. The
effects of the changes in the large separations on the ratios are negligible.
The variations of the separations may be a consequence of the influence from
the surface activity or systematic errors in measurements or some processes
taking place in the solar interior.

magnetic activity moderated by recombination on dust can account for the mass
accretion rates and the mid-infrared spectra and variability of protostellar
disks. The MHD calculations use the stratified shearing-box approach and
include grain settling and the feedback from the changing dust abundance on the
resistivity of the gas. The two-decade spread in accretion rates among T Tauri
stars is too large to result solely from variety in the grain size and stellar
X-ray luminosity, but can be produced by varying these together with the disk
magnetic flux. The diversity in the silicate bands can come from the coupling
of grain settling to the distribution of the magneto-rotational turbulence,
through three effects: (1) Recombination on grains yields a magnetically
inactive dead zone extending above two scale heights, while turbulence in the
magnetically active disk atmosphere overshoots the dead zone boundary by only
about one scale height. (2) Grains deep in the dead zone oscillate vertically
in waves driven by the turbulent layer above, but on average settle at the
laminar rates, so the interior of the dead zone is a particle sink and the disk
atmosphere becomes dust-depleted. (3) With sufficient depletion, the dead zone
is thinner and mixing dredges grains off the midplane. The MHD results also
show that the magnetic activity intermittently lifts clouds of dust into the
atmosphere. The photosphere height changes by up to one-third over a few
orbits, while the extinction along lines of sight grazing the disk surface
varies by factors of two over times down to 0.1 orbit. We suggest that the
changing shadows cast by the dust clouds on the outer disk are a cause of the
daily to monthly mid-infrared variability in some young stars. (Abridged.)

This leads to an increase of the Mott dissociation temperatures for quarkonia
states which stabilizes in particular the excited states, but has marginal
effect on the ground states. The temperature dependence of binding energies
suggests that the dissciation of the charmonium (bottomonium) ground state by

  Regularization -- Extended Version",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Regularization approaches have demonstrated their effectiveness for solving
ill-posed problems. However, in the context of variational restoration methods,
a challenging question remains, which is how to find a good regularizer. While
total variation introduces staircase effects, wavelet domain regularization
brings other artefacts, e.g. ringing. However, a compromise can be found by
introducing a hybrid regularization including several terms non necessarily
acting in the same domain (e.g. spatial and wavelet transform domains). We
adopt a convex optimization framework where the criterion to be minimized is
split in the sum of more than two terms. For spatial domain regularization,
isotropic or anisotropic total variation definitions using various gradient
filters are considered. An accelerated version of the Parallel ProXimal
Algorithm is proposed to perform the minimization. Some difficulties in the
computation of the proximity operators involved in this algorithm are also
addressed in this paper. Numerical experiments performed in the context of
Poisson data recovery, show the good behavior of the algorithm as well as
promising results concerning the use of hybrid regularization techniques.
