6D supergravity theories in F-theory. We focus on 6D (1, 0) models with one
tensor multiplet whose gauge group is a product of simple factors (modulo a
finite abelian group) with matter in arbitrary representations. Such theories
can be decomposed into blocks associated with the simple factors in the gauge
group; each block depends only on the group factor and the matter charged under
it. All 6D chiral supergravity models can be constructed by gluing such blocks
together in accordance with constraints from anomalies. Associating a geometric
structure to each block gives a dictionary for translating a supergravity model
into a set of topological data for an F-theory construction. We construct the
dictionary of F-theory divisors explicitly for some simple gauge group factors
and associated matter representations. Using these building blocks we analyze a
variety of models. We identify some 6D supergravity models which do not map to
integral F-theory divisors, possibly indicating quantum inconsistency of these
6D theories.

exclusion of point sources with L_X > 2 x 10^{35} erg/s (0.3-6 keV), we
investigate the morphology and spectrum of the residual X-ray emission. This
residual emission has a soft X-ray spectrum which can be fitted with a
two-temperature thermal model, with kT = 0.2 keV and 0.6 keV. The soft X-ray
surface brightness distribution shows a strong correlation with FUV emission,
indicative of a close connection between recent star-formation activity and the
production of soft X-rays. Within 3.5 kpc of the nucleus of M33, the soft X-ray
and FUV surface brightness distributions exhibit similar radial profiles. This
implies that the ratio of the soft X-ray luminosity (0.3-2.0 keV) to the star
formation rate (SFR) per unit disk area remains fairly constant within this
inner disk region. We derive a value for this ratio of 1-1.5 x 10^{39}
(erg/s)/(M_sun/yr), consistent with previous studies. In the same region, the
ratio of soft X-ray luminosity to stellar mass (derived from K-band photometry)
is 4 x 10^{28} erg/s/M_sun, a factor of 5-10 higher than is typical of dwarf
elliptical galaxies, suggesting that 10-20% of the unresolved emission seen in
M33 may originate in its old stellar population. The remainder of the soft
X-ray emission is equally split between two spatial components, one which
closely traces the spiral arms of the galaxy and the other more smoothly
distributed across the inner disk of M33. The former must represent a highly
clumped low-filling factor component linked to sites of recent or ongoing star
formation, whereas the distribution of the latter gives few clues as to its

$f(\phi) = e^{\alpha\phi}$, are Lifshitz-like, with a dynamical exponent $z$

in these backgrounds. We find that somewhat surprisingly, the AC conductivity
vanishes like $\omega^2$ at T=0 independent of $\alpha$. We also explore the
charged black brane physics of several other classes of gauge-coupling
functions $f(\phi)$. In addition to possible applications in AdS/CMT, the
extremal black branes are of interest from the point of view of the attractor
mechanism. The near horizon geometries for these branes are universal,

using V, I, R and narrowband H-alpha photometry, we find 475 objects with
measured rotation periods, which are very likely pre-main-sequence members of
the Cep OB3b star forming region.
  We revise the distance and age to Cep OB3b, putting it on the self-consistent
age and distance ladder of Mayne & Naylor (2008). This yields a distance
modulus of 8.8 +/- 0.2 mags, corresponding to a distance of 580 +/- 60 pc, and
an age of 4-5Myrs.
  The rotation period distribution confirms the general picture of rotational
evolution in young stars, exhibiting both the correlation between accretion
(determined in this case through narrowband H-alpha photometry) and rotation
expected from disc locking, and the dependence of rotation upon mass that is
seen in other star forming regions. However, this mass dependence is much
weaker in our data than found in other studies. Comparison to the similarly
aged NGC 2362 shows that the low-mass stars in Cep OB3b are rotating much more
slowly. This points to a possible link between star forming environment and
rotation properties. Such a link would call into question models of stellar
angular momentum evolution, which assume that the rotational period
distributions of young clusters and associations can be assembled into an
evolutionary sequence, thus ignoring environmental effects.

between a rapidly-rotating, supersonic, dense accretion disc and a
slowly-rotating low-density magnetosphere of a magnetized star. The
magnetopause is a strong shear layer with rapid changes in the azimuthal
velocity, the density, and the magnetic field over a short radial distance and
thus the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability may be important. The plasma
dynamics is treated using non-relativistic, compressible (isentropic)
magnetohydrodynamics. It is necessary to include the displacement current in
order that plasma wave velocities remain less than the speed of light. We focus
mainly on the case of a star with an aligned dipole magnetic field so that the
magnetic field is axial in the disc midplane and perpendicular to the disc flow
velocity. However, we also give results for cases where the magnetic field is
at an arbitrary angle to the flow velocity. For the aligned dipole case the
magnetopause is most unstable for KH waves propagating in the azimuthal
direction perpendicular to the magnetic field which tends to stabilize waves
propagating parallel to it. The wave phase velocity is that of the disc matter.
A quasi-linear theory of the saturation of the instability leads to a
wavenumber ($k$) power spectrum $\propto k^{-1}$ of the density and temperature
fluctuations of the magnetopause, and it gives the mass accretion and angular
momentum inflow rates across the magnetopause. For self-consistent conditions
this mass accretion rate will be equal to the disc accretion rate at large
distances from the magnetopause.

generate corrections to the mixing angles as large as ${\cal O}(\lambda_C^2)$.

index. For those objects where 450 um fluxes are available we also attempt a
two component dust SED fit, with warm and cool dust and a dust emissivity index
of beta=2. Such a model has been found to be a good fit to lower luminosity
systems. We find that it also works well for ULIRGs, but that ULIRGs have a
smaller cold dust component. Comparison of the dust mass derived for ULIRGs and
more normal spiral galaxies suggests that the dust content of a ULIRG is simply
the combined dust content of the two galaxies whose merger has triggered the
ULIRG activity. We examine the high end of the 850 um luminosity function and
find results consistent with those of the earlier SLUGS survey. We also find
that ULIRGs make up only about 50% of the high end of the 850 um luminosity
function, with LIRGs containing a large mass of cool dust likely to be
responsible for the rest.

clusters of galaxies. These diffuse radio sources are rare, having so far been
found only in about 30 clusters of galaxies, suggesting that particular
conditions are needed to form and maintain them. It is interesting to
investigate the presence of radio halos in close pairs of interacting clusters
in order to possibly clarify their origin in relation to the evolutionary state
of the merger. In this work, we study the case of the close pair of galaxy
clusters A399 and A401. A401 is already known to contain a faint radio halo,
while a hint of diffuse emission in A399 has been suggested based on the NVSS.
To confirm this possibility, we analyzed deeper Very Large Array observations
at 1.4 GHz of this cluster. We find that the central region of A399 is
permeated by a diffuse low-surface brightness radio emission that we classify
as a radio halo with a linear size of about 570 kpc and a central brightness of
0.3 micro-Jy/arcsec^2. Indeed, given their comparatively small projected
distance of about 3 Mpc, the pair of galaxy clusters A401 and A399 can be
considered as the first example of double radio halo system. The discovery of
this double halo is extraordinary given the rarity of these radio sources in
general and given that current X-ray data seem to suggest that the two clusters
are still in a pre-merger state. Therefore, the origin of the double radio halo
is likely to be attributed to the individual merging histories of each cluster
separately, rather than to the result of a close encounter between the two
systems.

Compositions of two random fixed-point-free involutions, on the other hand,

all cycle lengths even. The number of factorizations of a random permutation
into two involutions appears to be asymptotically lognormally distributed,
which we prove for a closely related probabilistic model. This study is
motivated by the observation that the number of involutions in [n] is
(n!)^(1/2) times a subexponential factor; more generally the number of
permutations with all cycle lengths in a finite set S is n!^(1-1/m) times a

as a multi-purpose apparatus, this experiment will record all the particles
produced in the collisions between the antiproton beam and the target, with a
rather wide acceptance. So detecting Drell-Yan dileptons with or without
analyzing the other fragments is just a matter of applying cutoffs in the data
analysis stage. The distribution of the products of 50,000 typical Drell-Yan

resulting distributions are inserted within the PANDA acceptance region, to
analyze the chances of missing some searched fragment combinations, or of
confusing different sets of particles. The most interesting result is that, due

a local density approach and the calculations are performed following two
different procedures: one is based on a many-body method using the Lindhard
function and the other one is based on a Monte Carlo simulation. While both
procedures coincide when it comes to consider the contribution of kaon
quasi-elastic scattering, the simulation method offers more flexibility since
it allows us to account for other processes which also contribute to the proton
spectra, such as K- absorption by one and two nucleons producing hyperons. The
simulation also considers final state interactions in terms of multiple
scattering of the K-, p and all other primary and secondary particles on their
way out of the nucleus, as well as the weak decay of the produced hyperons into
(pi N). We find that this kaon in-flight reaction is not well suited to
determine the kaon optical potential due, essentially, to the limited
sensitivity of the cross section to its strength, but also to unavoidable

to our understanding of the behavior of many-body systems far from equilibrium.
In this paper we aim at characterizing the properties of diffusion limited
reactions both in their steady states and out of stationarity. Many
reaction-diffusion systems have the peculiarity that microscopic reversibility
is broken such that their transient behavior can not be investigated through
the study of most of the observables discussed in the literature. For this
reason we analyze the transient properties of reaction-diffusion systems
through a specific work observable that remains well defined even in the
absence of microscopic reversibility and that obeys an exact detailed
fluctuation relation in cases where detailed balance is fulfilled. We thereby
drive the systems out of their nonequilibrium steady states through
time-dependent reaction rates. Using a numerical exact method and computer
simulations, we analyze fluctuation ratios of the probability distributions
obtained during the forward and reversed processes. We show that the underlying
microscopic dynamics gives rise to peculiarities in the configuration space
trajectories, thereby yielding prominent features in the fluctuation ratios.

was defined in Luhmann's (1984) social systems theory as the designation of a

only a category for the observation. The distinction between observation and
expectation enables the sociologist to appreciate the processing of meaning in
social systems. Design: The specification of ""the observer"" in the tradition of
systems theory is analyzed in historical detail. Inconsistencies and
differences in perspectives are explicated, and the specificity of human
language is further specified. The processing of meaning in social systems adds
another layer to the communication. Findings: Reflexivity about the different
perspectives of participant observers and an external observer is fundamental
to the sociological discourse. The ranges of possible observations from
different perspectives can be considered as second-order observations or
equivalently as the specification of an uncertainty in the observations. This
specification of an uncertainty provides us with an expectation. The
expectation can be provided with (one or more) values by observations. The
significance of observations can be tested when the expectations are properly
specified.

solids with molecular lengths from 20 to 1400 carbon atoms. Two cases are
considered: (a) polymer sliding against a hard substrate, and (b) polymer
sliding on polymer. We discuss the velocity dependence of the frictional shear
stress for both cases. In our simulations, the polymer films are very thin
(approx. 3 nm), and the solid walls are connected to a thermostat at a short
distance from the polymer slab. Under these circumstances we find that
frictional heating effects are not important, and the effective temperature in
the polymer film is always close to the thermostat temperature. In the first
setup (a), for hydrocarbons with molecular lengths from 60 to 1400 carbon
atoms, the shear stresses are nearly independent of molecular length, but for
the shortest hydrocarbon C20H42 the frictional shear stress is lower. In all
cases the frictional shear stress increases monotonically with the sliding
velocity. For polymer sliding on polymer [case (b)] the friction is much
larger, and the velocity dependence is more complex. For hydrocarbons with
molecular lengths from 60 to 140 C-atoms, the number of monolayers of lubricant
increases (abruptly) with increasing sliding velocity (from 6 to 7 layers),
leading to a decrease of the friction. Before and after the layering
transition, the frictional shear stresses are nearly proportional to the
logarithm of sliding velocity. For the longest hydrocarbon (1400 C-atoms) the
friction shows no dependence on the sliding velocity, and for the shortest
hydrocarbon (20 C-atoms) the frictional shear stress increases nearly linearly

the American handling of the Cuban missile crisis are explained by using the
model of the potential autopoiesis of subsystems. Under wartime conditions, the
codes of political and military communications can increasingly be
differentiated. Design/methodology/approach: The model of a further
differentiation between political and military power is developed on the basis
of a detailed description of the Cuban missile crisis. We introduce the concept
of a ""semi-dormant autopoiesis"" for the difference in the dynamics between
peacetime and wartime conditions. Findings: Several dangerous incidents during
the crisis can be explained by a sociocybernetic model focusing on
communication and control, but not by using an organization-theoretical
approach. The further differentiation of the military as a subsystem became
possible in the course of the twentieth century because of ongoing learning
processes about previous wars.

Supersymmetric Particle (LSP) is the gravitino, it possesses a lifetime larger
than the age of the universe since its RPV induced decay channels are
suppressed by the weak gravitational strength. This conclusion holds if one
considers gravitino masses ~ 10^2 GeV like in supergravity scenarios, and is
robust if the lightest pseudoscalar Higgs field is as light as ~ 10 GeV [as may
occur in the NMSSM]. For these models predicting in particular an RPV
neutrino-photino mixing, the gravitino lifetime exceeds the age of the universe
by two orders of magnitude. However, we find that the gravitino cannot
constitute a viable dark matter candidate since its too large RPV decay widths
would then conflict with the flux data of last indirect detection experiments.
The cases of a sneutrino LSP or a neutralino LSP as well as the more promising
gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking scenario are also discussed. Both the

the rate limiting process is grain boundary sliding, and grains readily
accommodate their shapes by slip to preserve spatial continuity. It is shown
that thinking of a polycrystal with randomly oriented grains as an homogeneous
and isotropic continuum when dealing with it as a dynamical medium, even in a
scale much larger than the grain size, leads to gross errors. The polyhedral
nature of grains influences the plastic flow in a radical manner, as the
relative velocity of adjacent grains is constrained to the common boundary
plane, and only the in--plane shear stress contributes to their relative
motion. This constriction determines that the divergency of the velocity field
of the material medium does not vanish, and plastic deformation necessarily
involves grain volume variations, which can only be elastic. As this has a
limit, fracture follows as a necessary step of plastic flow. A theoretical
approach to plastic flow is developed, and emphasis is done in superplastic
deformation, from zero to fracture strain. The theory allows to quantitatively
explain the observed features of superplastic materials and responds to many
open questions in the field.

observational errors of systemic velocities ($\gamma$) are high, propagated
errors are usually less than computed dispersions. According to the analysis of
propagated uncertainties on the computed space velocities, available sample is
refined by removing the systems with the largest propagated uncertainties so
that the reliability of the space velocity dispersions was improved. Having a
dispersion of $51\pm7$ km s$^{-1}$ for the space velocities, CVs in the current
refined sample (159 systems) are found to have $5\pm1$ Gyr mean kinematical
age. After removing magnetic systems from the sample, it is found that
non-magnetic CVs (134 systems) have a mean kinematical age of $4\pm1$ Gyr.
According to $5\pm1$ and $4\pm1$ Gyr kinematical ages implied by $52\pm8$ and
$45\pm7$ km s$^{-1}$ dispersions for non-magnetic systems below and above the
period gap, CVs below the period gap are older than systems above the gap,

difference between the systems below and above the gap is smaller than that
expected from the standard theory, indicating a similarity of the angular

the SMC `bar' have M_s=4 and may be tracing shearing or turbulent flows. Using
numerical simulations we also investigate how the slope of the spatial power
spectrum depends on both sonic and Alfven Mach numbers. This allows us to gauge
the Alfven Mach number of the SMC and conclude that its gas pressure dominates
over the magnetic pressure. The super-Alfvenic nature of the HI gas in the SMC
is also highlighted by the bispectrum, a three-point correlation function which
characterizes the level of non-Gaussianity in wave modes. We find that the
bispectrum of the SMC HI column density displays similar large-scale

signatures of an extended (25 mas) and a compact component (5.8 mas), with the
compact component contributing about 2/3 of the total flux. The brightness
distribution is highly asymmetric, as indicated by the strong closure phases
(up to 40 deg) and the detected position angle dependence of the visibilities
and closure phases. To interpret these asymmetries, we employ geometric as well
as physical models, including a binary model, a skewed ring model, and a
puffed-up inner rim model with a vertical or curved rim shape. Our curved
puffed-up rim model can reasonably well reproduce the interferometric
observables and the SED simultaneously and suggests a luminosity of 29 L_sun

very little to around 10^9 G. Here we examine the proposal that the strongest
fields are generated by dynamo action during the common envelope phase of
strongly interacting stars that leads to binary systems containing at least one
white dwarf. The resulting magnetic field depends strongly on the electrical
conductivity of the white dwarf, the lifetime of the convective envelope and
the variability of the magnetic dynamo. We assess the various energy sources
available and estimate necessary lifetimes of the common envelope. In the case
of a dynamo that leads a randomly oriented magnetic field we find that the
induced field is confined to a thin boundary layer at the surface of the white
dwarf. This then decays away rapidly upon dispersal of the common envelope. The
residual field is typically less than 10^-8 times the strength of the external
field. Only in the case where there is some preferential direction to the
dynamo-generated field can an induced field, that avoids rapid decay, be
produced. We show that a surface field of magnitude a few per cent of the

strength of the perturbation field within the shell is screened by the
spherically symmetric component of the mass, and is reduced as the spherically
symmetric component is increased. For a two-shell system, we again show that
the perturbed field is screened by the shells, no matter which shell's mass
distribution is perturbed. The field within the inner shell is most suppressed
when the inner and outer shells coincide. However, for a very light inner

the multi-GeV Fermi energy range and the TeV energy range observed by
atmospheric Cerenkov telescopes. The change in spectral index is produced by
two effects: (1) an intrinsic steepening, independent of redshift, owing to the
properties of emission and absorption in the source, and (2) a
redshift-dependent steepening produced by intergalactic pair production
interactions of blazar gamma-rays with low energy photons of the intergalactic
background light (IBL). Given this relation, with good enough data on the mean
gamma-ray SED of TeV selected BL Lacs, the redshift evolution of the IBL can,
in principle, be determined independently of stellar evolution models. We apply
our relation to the results of new Fermi observations of TeV selected blazars.

before decoupling (``Silk damping''). In a simple WKB analysis, neglecting
moments of the temperature distribution beyond the quadrupole, damping appears
in the acoustic mode as a term of order ik^2/(taudot) where taudot is the
scattering rate per unit conformal time. Although the Jeans instability is
stabilized on scales smaller than the adiabatic Jeans length, I show that the
medium is linearly unstable to first order in (1/taudot) to a slow diffusive
mode. At large comoving wavenumber, the characteristic growth rate becomes
independent of spatial scale and constant: (t_{KH}a)^-1 ~ (128 pi G/9 kappa_T
c)(rho_m/rho_b), where ""a"" is the scale factor, rho_m and rho_b are the matter
and baryon energy density, respectively, and kappa_T is the Thomson opacity.
This is the characteristic timescale for a fluid parcel to radiate away its
thermal energy content at the Eddington limit, analogous to the Kelvin-Helmholz
(KH) time for a massive star or the Salpeter time for black hole growth.
Although this mode grows at all times prior to decoupling and on scales smaller
than the horizon, the growth time is long, about 100 times the age of the
universe at decoupling. Thus, it modifies the density and temperature
perturbations on small scales only at the percent level. The physics of this
mode is already accounted for in the popular codes CMBFAST and CAMB, but is
typically neglected in analytic studies of the growth of primordial
perturbations. This work clarifies the physics of this instability in the epoch
before decoupling, and emphasizes that the universe is formally unstable on
scales below the horizon, even in the limit of large taudot. Analogous
instabilities at yet earlier epochs are also mentioned. (Abridged)

regulate the growth of distant galaxies and their central black holes. However,
current observational support for this hypothesis at high redshift is mostly
limited to rare z>2 radio galaxies. Here we present Gemini-North NIFS Intregral
Field Unit (IFU) observations of the [O III]5007 emission from a z~2
ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG; L_IR>10^12 L_sol) with an optically
identified Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). The spatial extent (~4-8 kpc) of the
high velocity and broad [O III] emission are consistent with that found in z>2
radio galaxies, indicating the presence of a large-scale energetic outflow in a
galaxy population potentially orders of magnitude more common than distant
radio galaxies. The low radio luminosity of this system indicates that
radio-bright jets are unlikely to be responsible for driving the outflow.
However, the estimated energy input required to produce the large-scale outflow
signatures (of order ~10^59 ergs over ~30 Myrs) could be delivered by a wind
radiatively driven by the AGN and/or supernovae winds from intense star
formation. The energy injection required to drive the outflow is comparable to
the estimated binding energy of the galaxy spheroid, suggesting that it can
have a significant impact on the evolution of the galaxy. We argue that the
outflow observed in this system is likely to be comparatively typical of the
high-redshift ULIRG population and discuss the implications of these
observations for galaxy formation models.

submillimeter galaxy. The fourth and fifth components do not appear to be
associated with any galaxy despite the deep imaging that is available in this

structure in the underlying gas, many of these emission systems show evidence
of velocity shear. It remains difficult to distinguish between an underlying
rotation of the gas and an outflow driven by the central object. We have
examined all of the line profiles for evidence of strong absorption features.
While several systems are better fitted by the inclusion of a weak absorption

demonstrated for the two structures when the details of the structure are

uncertainty in device dimensions due to uncontrolled variation in processing,
like layer thickness and gate size, are calculated to be sufficient to explain
the disagreement. The sensitivity of the capacitances to small variations in
the structure also highlights the limits of accuracy of capacitance models for
QD analysis. We furthermore observe that a critical density, the metal

Polarization structure of the Dirac field is shown to be rich enough to
determine the spacetime metric locally and to explain the emergence of observed

as the result of the local time slowdown and the Lorentz contraction as a
dynamic re-shaping of the waveforms in the course of their acceleration. A
definition of mass as a limiting curvature of the spinor-induced metric is
proposed. A view of the vacuum as a uniformly distributed unit invariant
density of the Dirac field with an explicitly preserved invariance of the light
cone is brought forward. Qualitative explanation of the observed charge
asymmetry as the consequence of the dynamics of localization is given. The
classical pion field is obtained as a manifestation of stresses, mass and
charge flux in localized waveforms of the Dirac field. Some implications of the
finite size of colliding objects for high-energy processes are discussed. A
hypothesis that known internal degrees of freedom are the local spacetime

suffered from the lack of self-consistent approximation schemes satisfying
Goldstone's theorem and dynamical conservation laws simultaneously. We present
a procedure to construct such approximations systematically by using either an
exact relation for the interaction energy or the Hugenholtz-Pines relation to
express the thermodynamic potential in a Luttinger-Ward form. Inspection of the
self-consistent perturbation expansion up to the third order with respect to
the interaction shows that the two relations yield a unique identical result at
each order, reproducing the conserving-gapless mean-field theory [T. Kita, J.
Phys. Soc. Jpn. 74, 1891 (2005)] as the lowest-order approximation. The
uniqueness implies that the series becomes exact when infinite terms are
retained. We also derive useful expressions for the entropy and superfluid
density in terms of Green's function and a set of real-time dynamical equations
to describe thermalization of the condensate.

the variance--are unknown. We address the problem with a method based on
Fourier transformation. The Fourier approach was first studied by Jin and Cai

review the main ideas in Jin and Cai (2007), and propose a generalized Fourier
approach to tackle the problem under another scenario: any non-null effect has
a larger mean than that of the null effects, but no constraint is imposed on
the variance. This approach and that in \cite{JC} complement with each other:
each approach is successful in a wide class of situations where the other
fails. Also, we extend the Fourier approach to estimate the proportion of
non-null effects. The proposed procedures perform well both in theory and in

one photon. The Fock-state wave functions are computed from the fundamental

an infrared divergence that requires a nonzero photon mass; due to
complications associated with this divergence, the standard parameterization is
to be preferred. We also show that the self-energy effects obtained from a

of planetary nebulae (PNe) central stars are compared and evaluated using 586
newly discovered and previously known PNe in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).
In order to achieve this we ran a series of evaluation tests using line ratios
derived from de-reddened, flux calibrated spectra. Pronounced differences
between the methods are exposed. Diagrams were created by comparing excitation
classes with H-beta line fluxes. The best methods are then compared to
published temperatures using the Zanstra method and assessed for their ability
to reflect central star effective temperatures and evolution. As a result we
call for a clarification of the term `excitation class' according to the
different input parameters used. The first method, which we refer to as Exneb
relies purely on the ratios of certain key emission lines. The second method,
which we refer to as Ex* includes modeling to create a continuous variable and,
for optically thick PNe in the Magellanic Clouds, is designed to relate more
closely to intrinsic stellar parameters. The third method, we refer to as Ex
[OIII]/H-beta since the [OIII]/H-beta ratio is used in isolation to other
temperature diagnostics. Each of these methods is shown to have serious
drawbacks when used as an indicator for central star temperature. Finally, we
suggest a new method (Exrho) for estimating excitation class incorporating both
the [OIII]/H-beta and the HeII4686 /H-beta ratios. Although any attempt to
provide accurate central star temperatures using the excitation class derived
from nebula lines will always be limited, we show that this new method provides
a substantial improvement over previous methods with better agreement to
temperatures derived through the Zanstra method.

Sr0.6K0.4Fe2As2 wires and tapes with a Tc = 34 K, which were fabricated through
an in-situ powder-in-tube process. Silver was used as a chemical addition as
well as a sheath material. Transport measurements were performed by a standard
four-probe resistive method. All the wire and tape samples have shown transport
properties. Critical current density Jc was enhanced upon silver addition, and
at 4.2 K, a best Jc of ~1200 A/cm^2 (Ic = 9 A) was achieved for 20 % silver
added tapes, which is the highest in iron-based wires and tapes so far. The Jc
is almost field independent between 1 T and 10 T, exhibiting a strong vortex
pinning. Such a high transport critical current density is attributed to the
absence of reaction layer between the silver sheath and superconducting core,
as well as an improved connectivity between grains. We also identify a
weak-link behavior from the creep drop of Jc at low fields and a hysteretic
phenomenon. Finally, we found that compared to Fe, Ta and Nb tubes, Ag was the
best sheath material for the fabrication of high-performance 122 type pnictide
wires and tapes.

~10^{62} ergs, the most energetic AGN outburst currently known. We investigate
the evolution of this outburst with two-dimensional axisymmetric gasdynamical
calculations in which the cavities are inflated by relativistic cosmic rays.
Many key observational features of the cavities and associated shocks are
successfully reproduced. The radial elongation of the cavities indicates that
cosmic rays were injected into the cluster gas by a (jet) source moving out
from the central AGN. AGN jets of this magnitude must be almost perfectly
identically bipolar. The relativistic momentum of a single jet would cause a
central AGN black hole of mass 10^9 M_{sun} to recoil at ~6000 km s^{-1},
exceeding kick velocities during black hole mergers, and be ejected from the
cluster-center galaxy. When the cavity inflation is complete, 4PV
underestimates the total energy received by the cluster gas. Deviations of the
cluster gas from hydrostatic equilibrium are most pronounced during the early
cavity evolution when the integrated cluster mass found from the observed gas
pressure gradient can have systematic errors near the cavities of ~10-30%. The
creation of the cavity with cosmic rays generates a long-lasting global cluster
expansion that reduces the total gas thermal energy below that received from
the cavity shock. One Gyr after this single outburst, a gas mass of ~ 6 \times
10^{11} M_{sun} is transported out beyond a cluster radius of 500 kpc. Such
post-cavity outflows can naturally produce the discrepancy observed between the
cluster gas mass fraction and the universal baryon fraction inferred from WMAP
observations. (Abridged)

general values of parameters the muon decays set stringent constraints on the
couplings, and all rare tau decays are far below the current experimental

could be significantly suppressed by destructive interference between colored

improving the accuracy of resolver-based 16-bit encoders by compensating for

for a particular encoder, involves obtaining its error profile by calibrating
it on a precision rotary table, training the neural network by using a part of
this data and then determining the corrected encoder angle by subtracting the
ANN-predicted error from the measured value of the encoder angle. Since it is
not guaranteed that all the resolvers will have exactly similar error profiles
because of the inherent differences in their construction on a micro scale, the
ANN has been trained on one error profile at a time and the corresponding
weight file is then used only for compensating the systematic error of this
particular encoder. The systematic nature of the error profile for each of the
encoders has also been validated by repeated calibration of the encoders over a
period of time and it was found that the error profiles of a particular encoder
recorded at different epochs show near reproducible behavior. The ANN-based
error compensation procedure has been implemented for 4 encoders by training
the ANN with their respective error profiles and the results indicate that the
accuracy of encoders can be improved by nearly an order of magnitude from
quoted values of ~6 arc-min to ~0.65 arc-min when their corresponding

graphs. These random graphs arise in the modeling packet transmissions in
wireless networks. In contrast to previous studies on the SINR graphs, we
consider both a space and a time dimension. The spatial aspect originates from
the random locations of the network nodes in the Euclidean plane. The time
aspect stems from the random transmission policy followed by each network node
and from the time variations of the wireless channel characteristics. The
combination of these random space and time aspects leads to fluctuations of the
SINR experienced by the wireless channels, which in turn determine the
progression of packets in space and time in such a network. This paper studies
optimal paths in such wireless networks in terms of first passage percolation
on this random graph. We establish both ""positive"" and ""negative"" results on
the associated time constant. The latter determines the asymptotics of the
minimum delay required by a packet to progress from a source node to a
destination node when the Euclidean distance between the two tends to infinity.
The main negative result states that this time constant is infinite on the
random graph associated with a Poisson point process under natural assumptions
on the wireless channels. The main positive result states that when adding a
periodic node infrastructure of arbitrarily small intensity to the Poisson
point process, the time constant is positive and finite.

electron-to-proton mass ratio, mu = m_e/m_p, is applied to nearby dark clouds
in the Milky Way. This ratio, which is measured in different physical
environments of high (terrestrial) and low (interstellar) densities of baryonic
matter is supposed to vary in chameleon-like scalar field models, which predict
strong dependence of both masses and coupling constant on the local matter
density. High resolution spectral observations of molecular cores in lines of
NH3 (J,K) = (1,1), HC3N J = 2-1, and N2H+ J = 1-0 were performed at three radio
telescopes to measure the radial velocity offsets, DeltaV = V_rot - V_inv,
between the inversion transition of NH3 (1,1) and the rotational transitions of
other molecules with different sensitivities to the parameter dmm = (mu_obs -
mu_lab)/mu_lab. The measured values of DeltaV exhibit a statistically
significant velocity offset of 23 +/- 4_stat +/- 3_sys m/s. When interpreted in
terms of the electron-to-proton mass ratio variation, this infers that dmm =
(2.2 +/- 0.4_stat +/- 0.3_sys)x10^{-8}. If only a conservative upper bound is
considered, then the maximum offset between ammonia and the other molecules is
|DeltaV| <= 30 m/s. This gives the most accurate reference point at z = 0 for
dmm: |dmm| <= 3x10^{-8}.

four types in the redshift range z=0.006-0.156. The sample consists of 8

optical emission, 7 FR-IIs displaying high-excitation optical emission, and 6
FR-II broad emission line radio galaxies. Out of the sample of 27 objects, 10
nuclei are detected and several have constraining non-detections at
sensitivities of 7 mJy, the limiting flux a point source has when detected with
a signal-to-noise ratio of 10 in one hour of source integration. On the basis
of the core spectral energy distributions of this sample we find clear
indications that many FR-I and several low-excitation FR-II radio galaxies do
not contain warm dust tori. At least 57+-19 percent of the high-excitation
FR-IIs and almost all broad line radio galaxies display excess infrared
emission, which must be attributed to warm dust reradiating accretion activity.
The FR-I and low-excitation FR-II galaxies all possess low efficiencies,
calculated as the ratio of bolometric and Eddington luminosity log
(L_bol/L_Edd) < -3. This suggests that thick tori are absent at low accretion
rates and/or low efficiencies. We argue that the unification viewing angle
range 0-45 degrees of quasars should be increased to ~60 degrees, at least at
lower luminosities.

identified in the purely flux limited (17.5<=I<=24.0) VIMOS-VLT Deep Survey

correct for potential systematics that might affect the overall distribution as
well as the individual properties of the identified systems. Simulated samples
allow us to forecast the number and properties of groups that can be
potentially found in a survey with VVDS-like selection functions. We use them
to correct for the expected incompleteness and also to asses how well galaxy
redshifts trace the line-of-sight velocity dispersion of the underlying mass
overdensity. In particular, we train on these mock catalogues the adopted
group-finding technique (the Voronoi-Delaunay Method, VDM). The goal is to
fine-tune its free parameters, recover in a robust and unbiased way the
redshift and velocity dispersion distributions of groups and maximize the level
of completeness (C) and purity (P) of the group catalogue. We identify 318 VVDS
groups with at least 2 members within 0.2<=z<=1.0, among which 144 (/30) with
at least 3 (/5) members. The sample has globally C=60% and P=50%. Nearly 45% of
the groups with at least 3 members are still recovered if we run the algorithm
with a parameter set which maximizes P (75%). We exploit the group sample to
study the redshift evolution of the fraction f_b of blue galaxies (U-B<=1)
within 0.2<=z<=1. We find that f_b is significantly lower in groups than in the
whole ensemble of galaxies irrespectively of their environment. These
quantities increase with redshift, with f_b in groups showing a marginally
significant steeper increase. We also confirm that, at any explored redshift,
f_b decreases for increasing group richness, and we extend towards fainter
luminosities the magnitude range over which this result holds.

observations with the soft X-ray data of the RossiXTE/ASM. Our analysis shows a
clear orbital modulation of the spectral hardness, with peaks in correspondence
with the pre-periastron flare and near phase 0.25. The hardness peaks we found
could be related with the wind-plus-stream accretion model proposed in order to
explain the orbital light curve modulation of GX 301-2. Timing analysis of the
pulsar spin period shows that the secular trend of the about 680 s pulse period
is consistent with the previous observations, although there is evidence of a
slight decrease in the spin-down rate. The analysis of the hard X-ray pulsed
emission also showed a variable pulse shape profile as a function of the
orbital phase, with substructures detected near the passage at the periastron,
and a clear modulation of the pulsed fraction, which appears in turn strongly
anti-correlated with the source intensity.

analyzing the scaling properties of the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation.

authority of an empirical ordering of attributes, for example of a ranking of
the performance of institutions or of the influence of genes on a response
variable. In the first of these examples, the number, $p$, of quantities being
ordered is sometimes only moderate in size; in the second it can be very large,
often much greater than sample size. However, we show that in both types of
problem the conventional bootstrap can produce inconsistency. Moreover, the
standard $n$-out-of-$n$ bootstrap estimator of the distribution of an empirical
rank may not converge in the usual sense; the estimator may converge in
distribution, but not in probability. Nevertheless, in many cases the bootstrap
correctly identifies the support of the asymptotic distribution of ranks. In
some contemporary problems, bootstrap prediction intervals for ranks are
particularly long, and in this context, we also quantify the accuracy of
bootstrap methods, showing that the standard bootstrap gets the order of
magnitude of the interval right, but not the constant multiplier of interval
length. The $m$-out-of-$n$ bootstrap can improve performance and produce
statistical consistency, but it requires empirical choice of $m$; we suggest a
tuning solution to this problem. We show that in genomic examples, where it
might be expected that the standard, ``synchronous'' bootstrap will
successfully accommodate nonindependence of vector components, that approach
can produce misleading results. An ``independent component'' bootstrap can
overcome these difficulties, even in cases where components are not strictly
independent.

with a Bayesian technique and based on high quality CoRoT photometry with those

  The rotational period of the star was determined from a nearly 60 day long
continuous light curve obtained during the initial run of CoRoT. Using a
Bayesian approach to star-spot modelling, which in this work is applied for the
first time for the photometric mapping of a CP star, we derived longitudes,
latitudes and radii of four different spot areas. Additional parameters like
stellar inclination and the spot's intensities were also determined. The CoRoT
observations triggered an extensive ground-based spectroscopic and
spectropolarimetric observing campaign and enabled us to obtain 19 different
high resolution spectra in Stokes parameters I and V with NARVAL, ESPaDOnS, and
SemelPol spectropolarimeters.
  Doppler and Magnetic Doppler imaging techniques allowed us to derive the
magnetic field geometry of the star and the surface abundance distributions of
Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, Y, and Cu. We find a dominant dipolar structure of
the surface magnetic field. The CoRoT light curve variations and abundances of
most elements mapped are correlated with the aforementioned geometry: Cr, Fe,

regions on the surface of HD 50773 as predicted by our light curve synthesis

enlarging the gauge group of gravity formulated as gauge theory. Our starting
point is an action that describes a generally covariant gauge theory for a
group G. The Minkowski background breaks the gauge group by selecting in it a
preferred gravitational SU(2) subgroup. We expand the action around this
background and find the spectrum of linearized theory to consist of the usual
gravitons plus Yang-Mills fields charged under the centralizer of the SU(2) in
G. In addition, there is a set of Higgs fields that are charged both under the
gravitational and Yang-Mills subgroups. These fields are generically massive
and interact with both gravity and Yang-Mills sector in the standard way. The
arising interaction of the Yang-Mills sector with gravity is also standard.
Parameters such as the Yang-Mills coupling constant and Higgs mass arise from
the potential function defining the theory. Both are realistic in the sense
explained in the paper.

the caustic enhancement of the trailing side (TS) by aberration and retardation
(AR), which squeezes the emission into a narrower phase interval; 2) the
weakening of the TS caused by the asymmetry of curvature radiation about the
dipole axis. Analysis of the radii of curvature of electron trajectories in the
inertial observer's frame (IOF) enables these two effects to be considered
together. We demonstrate that for dipolar magnetic field lines on the TS there
exists a `caustic phase' beyond which no emission can be observed. This phase
corresponds to the zero (or minimum) curvature of the IOF trajectories and
maximum bunching of the emission. The maximum gradient of polarisation angle
(PA) in the S-shaped PA curve is also associated with the curvature minimum and
occurs at exactly the same phase. The asymmetry of trajectory curvature with
respect to the dipole axis affects the curvature emissivity and the efficiency
of pair production, suggesting a minimum at the caustic phase. Emission over a
fixed range of altitudes, as expected in millisecond pulsars, leads to broad
leading profiles and sharp peaks with a cutoff phase on the TS. We apply our
results to the main pulse of the 5 ms pulsar J1012+5307.

D-branes. We show, through world-sheet methods, how the insertion of closed
string background fluxes may modify the effective interactions on Dirichlet and
Euclidean branes. In particular, we compute flux-induced fermionic masses. The
generality of our results is exploited to determine the soft terms of the

new non-perturbative superpotential terms in presence of gauge and stringy
instantons in SQCD-like models. The second part is devoted to the description
of statistical systems through effective string models. In particular, we focus
our attention on (d-1)-dimensional interfaces, present in particular
statistical systems defined on compact d-dimensional spaces. We compute their
exact partition function by resorting to standard covariant quantization of the

$c$-optimal designs can be described as representations of boundary points of a

the Elfving set corresponding to a heteroscedastic regression model is the
convex hull of a set of ellipsoids induced by the underlying model and indexed

representations of the points where the line in direction of the vector $c$

with $n$ vertices, which initially contains no edges. In each step, a new edge
is drawn uniformly at random from all non-edges and is presented to the player,
henceforth called Painter. Painter must assign one of $r$ available colors to
each edge immediately, where $r \geq 2$ is a fixed integer. The game is over as
soon as a monochromatic copy of some fixed graph $F$ has been created, and
Painter's goal is to 'survive' for as many steps as possible before this
happens.
  We present a new technique for deriving upper bounds on the threshold of this
game, i.e., on the typical number of steps Painter will survive with an optimal
strategy. More specifically, we consider a deterministic two-player variant of
the game where the edges are not chosen randomly, but by a second player
Builder. However, Builder has to adhere to the restriction that, for some real
number $d$, the ratio of edges to vertices in all subgraphs of the evolving
board never exceeds $d$. We show that the existence of a winning strategy for
Builder in this deterministic game implies an upper bound of $n^{2-1/d}$ for
the threshold of the original probabilistic game. Moreover, we show that the
best bound that can be derived in this way is indeed the threshold of the game
if $F$ is a forest. We illustrate our technique with several examples, and
derive new explicit bounds for the case when $F$ is a path.

energy, i.e., in affinely-invariant metric tensors on the configuration space.
In a sense this resembles the idea of Maupertuis variational principle. We
discuss also the dynamics of the field of linear frames, invariant under the
action of linear group of internal symmetries. It turns out that such models
have automatically the generalized Born-Infeld structure. This is some new

nonlinear elasticity and in mechanics of relativistic continua with

waves into a regime where detection is highly plausible. The development of
techniques that allow us to discriminate a signal of astrophysical origin from
instrumental artefacts in the interferometer data and to extract the full range
of information are some of the primary goals of the current work. Here we
report the details of a Bayesian approach to the problem of inference for
gravitational wave observations using a network of instruments, for the
computation of the Bayes factor between two hypotheses and the evaluation of
the marginalised posterior density functions of the unknown model parameters.
The numerical algorithm to tackle the notoriously difficult problem of the
evaluation of large multi-dimensional integrals is based on a technique known
as Nested Sampling, which provides an attractive alternative to more
traditional Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We discuss the details of
the implementation of this algorithm and its performance against a Gaussian
model of the background noise, considering the specific case of the signal
produced by the in-spiral of binary systems of black holes and/or neutron
stars, although the method is completely general and can be applied to other
classes of sources. We also demonstrate the utility of this approach by
introducing a new coherence test to distinguish between the presence of a
coherent signal of astrophysical origin in the data of multiple instruments and
the presence of incoherent accidental artefacts, and the effects on the
estimation of the source parameters as a function of the number of instruments
in the network.

infinite) directed trees is introduced and investigated. Operators in question
are to be considered as a generalization of classical weighted shifts, on the
one hand, and of weighted adjacency operators, on the other; they are called
weighted shifts on directed trees. The basic properties of such operators,
including closedness, adjoints, polar decomposition and moduli are studied.
Circularity and the Fredholmness of weighted shifts on directed trees are
discussed. The relationships between domains of a weighted shift on a directed
tree and its adjoint are described. Hyponormality, cohyponormality,
subnormality and complete hyperexpansivity of such operators are entirely
characterized in terms of their weights. Related questions that arose during
the study of the topic are solved as well. Particular trees with one branching
vertex are intensively studied mostly in the context of subnormality and
complete hyperexpansivity of weighted shifts on them. A strict connection of
the latter with $k$-step backward extendibility of subnormal as well as
completely hyperexpansive unilateral classical weighted shifts is established.
Models of subnormal and completely hyperexpansive weighted shifts on these
particular trees are constructed. Various illustrative examples of weighted
shifts on directed trees with the prescribed properties are furnished. Many of
them are simpler than those previously found on occasion of investigating
analogical properties of other classes of operators.
