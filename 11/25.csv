the number of ""yes or no"" questions (queries) posed about that object. We
consider three extensions of this fundamental problem that are motivated by
practical considerations in real-world, time-critical identification tasks such
as emergency response. First, we consider the problem where the objects are
partitioned into groups, and the goal is to identify only the group to which
the object belongs. Second, we address the situation where the queries are
partitioned into groups, and an algorithm may suggest a group of queries to a
human user, who then selects the actual query. Third, we consider the problem
of query learning in the presence of persistent query noise, and relate it to
group identification. To address these problems we show that a standard
algorithm for query learning, known as the splitting algorithm or generalized
binary search, may be viewed as a generalization of Shannon-Fano coding. We
then extend this result to the group-based settings, leading to new algorithms.
The performance of our algorithms is demonstrated on simulated data and on a
database used by first responders for toxic chemical identification.

Survey (COSMOS). Using the Spitzer IRAC and MIPS photometry, we estimate the
total infrared luminosity, L_IR (8--1000 microns), by finding the best fit
template from several different template libraries. The long wavelength 70 and
160 micron data allow us to obtain a reliable estimate of L_IR, accurate to
within 0.2 and 0.05 dex, respectively. The 70 micron data point enables a
significant improvement over the luminosity estimates possible with only a 24
micron detection. The full sample spans a wide range in L_IR, L_IR ~ 10^8-10^14
L_sun, with a median luminosity of 10^11.4 L_sun. We identify a total of 687
luminous, 303 ultraluminous, and 31 hyperluminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs,
ULIRGs, and HyLIRGs) over the redshift range 0.01<z<3.5 with a median redshift
of 0.5. Presented here are the full spectral energy distributions for each of
the sources compiled from the extensive multiwavelength data set from the
ultraviolet (UV) to the far-infrared (FIR). Using SED fits we find possible
evidence for a subset of cooler ultraluminous objects than observed locally.
However, until direct observations at longer wavelengths are obtained, the peak
of emission and the dust temperature cannot be well constrained. We use these
SEDs, along with the deep radio and X-ray coverage of the field, to identify a
large sample of candidate active galactic nuclei (AGN). We find that the
fraction of AGN increases strongly with L_IR, as it does in the local universe,
and that nearly 70% of ULIRGs and all HyLIRGs likely host a powerful AGN.

correspond to the head on collision of the strings, due to the breakdown of
Lorentz invariance in the underlying noncommutative field theory.

calculating the spectral line intensity and polarization that emerges from a
(generally magnetized) astrophysical plasma composed of atoms and molecules
whose excitation state is significantly influenced by radiative transitions
produced by an anisotropic radiation field. The numerical solution of this
non-LTE problem of the 2nd kind is facilitating the physical understanding of
the second solar spectrum and the exploration of the complex magnetism of the
extended solar atmosphere, but much more could be learned if high-sensitivity
polarimeters were developed also for the present generation of night-time

of some resonance line transitions can be efficiently modulated by the
inclination of a weak magnetic field when the anisotropy of the incident
radiation is significant, something that could provide a new diagnostic tool in

solids. Bulk growth is modeled by a material manifold with an evolving metric.
Time dependence of metric represents the evolution of the stress-free (natural)
configuration of the body in response to changes in mass density and ""shape"".
We show that time dependency of material metric will affect the energy balance
and the entropy production inequality; both the energy balance and the entropy
production inequality have to be modified. We then obtain the governing
equations covariantly by postulating invariance of energy balance under
time-dependent spatial diffeomorphisms. We use the principle of maximum entropy
production in deriving an evolution equation for the material metric. In the
case of isotropic growth, we find those growth distributions that do not result
in residual stresses. We then look at Lagrangian field theory of growing
elastic solids. We will use the Lagrange-d'Alembert's principle with Rayleigh's
dissipation functions to derive all the governing equations. We make an
explicit connection between our geometric theory and the conventional
multiplicative decomposition of deformation gradient
$\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{F}_e\mathbf{F}_g$ into growth and elastic parts. We
linearize the nonlinear theory and derive a linearized theory of growth
mechanics. Finally, we obtain the stress-free growth distributions in the
linearized theory.

have a piecewise linear concave dynamics not necessarily monotonic. We
introduce a deterministic Petri net extension where edges may have negative

by a generalized matrix with a submatrix in the standard algebra with possibly
negative entries, and another submatrix in the minplus algebra. When the
dynamics is additively homogeneous, a generalized additive eigenvalue may be
introduced, and the ergodic theory may be used to define a growth rate under
additional technical assumptions. In the traffic example of two roads with one
junction, we compute explicitly the eigenvalue and we show, by numerical
simulations, that these two quantities (the additive eigenvalue and the growth
rate) are not equal, but are close to each other. With this result, we are able
to extend the well-studied notion of fundamental traffic diagram (the average
flow as a function of the car density on a road) to the case of two roads with
one junction and give a very simple analytic approximation of this diagram
where four phases appear with clear traffic interpretations. Simulations show
that the fundamental diagram shape obtained is also valid for systems with many
junctions. To simulate these systems, we have to compute their dynamics, which
are not quite simple. For building them in a modular way, we introduce
generalized parallel, series and feedback compositions of piecewise linear
concave dynamics.

Hamiltonian used can be derived from the ""giant Kerr effect"" for a four-level

penalization arises from the Bayesian analysis itself when the experimental
value of $M_Z$ is considered. This allows to scan the whole parameter space,
allowing arbitrarily large soft terms. Still the low-energy region is
statistically favoured (even before including dark matter or g-2 constraints).
Contrary to other studies, the results are almost unaffected by changing the
upper limits taken for the soft terms. The results are also remarkable stable
when using flat or logarithmic priors, a fact that arises from the larger
statistical weight of the low-energy region in both cases. Then we incorporate
all the important experimental constrains to the analysis, obtaining a map of

separate analyses depending on the group of observables used. When only the
most robust ones are used, the favoured region of the parameter space contains
a significant portion outside the LHC reach. This effect gets reinforced if the

assuming that the channel state is available at the source, the relay, and the

perturbations from other stars, which may induce orbital precession of the same

while measurement of the quadrupole moment is likely to require observation of
stars inside ~0.2 mpc. A high fraction of stellar remnants, e.g. 10-Solar-mass

supernova (SN) 2008iy. SN 2008iy showed an unprecedentedly long rise time of
~400 days, making it the first SN to take significantly longer than 100 days to
reach peak optical luminosity. The peak absolute magnitude of SN 2008iy was M_r
~ -19.1 mag, and the total radiated energy over the first ~700 days was ~2 x
10^50 erg. Spectroscopically, SN 2008iy is very similar to the Type IIn SN
1988Z at late times, and, like SN 1988Z, it is a luminous X-ray source (both
supernovae had an X-ray luminosity L_ X > 10^41 erg/s). The Halpha emission
profile of SN 2008iy shows a narrow P Cygni absorption component, implying a
pre-SN wind speed of ~100 km/s. We argue that the luminosity of SN 2008iy is
powered via the interaction of the SN ejecta with a dense, clumpy circumstellar
medium. The ~400 day rise time can be understood if the number density of
clumps increases with distance over a radius ~1.7 x 10^16 cm from the
progenitor. This scenario is possible if the progenitor experienced an episodic
phase of enhanced mass-loss < 1 century prior to explosion or the progenitor
wind speed increased during the decades before core collapse. We favour the
former scenario, which is reminiscent of the eruptive mass-loss episodes
observed for luminous blue variable (LBV) stars. The progenitor wind speed and
increased mass-loss rates serve as further evidence that at least some, and
perhaps all, Type IIn supernovae experience LBV-like eruptions shortly before
core collapse. We also discuss the host galaxy of SN 2008iy, a subluminous
dwarf galaxy, and offer a few reasons why the recent suggestion that unusual,
luminous supernovae preferentially occur in dwarf galaxies may be the result of
observational biases.

moderately high mass (10 - 25 solar mass) stars. The physical properties of
these stars mark them as an important and extreme stage of massive stellar
evolution, but determining these properties has been a struggle for many years.
The cool extended atmospheres of RSGs place them in an extreme position on the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and present a significant challenge to the
conventional assumptions of stellar atmosphere models. The dusty circumstellar
environments of these stars can potentially complicate the determination of
their physical properties, and unusual RSGs in the Milky Way and neighboring
galaxies present a suite of enigmatic properties and behaviors that strain, and
sometimes even defy, the predictions of stellar evolutionary theory. However,
in recent years our understanding of RSGs, including the models and methods
applied to our observations and interpretations of these stars, has changed and
grown dramatically. This review looks back at some of the latest work that has
progressed our understanding of RSGs, and considers the many new questions
posed by our ever-evolving picture of these cool massive stars.

algorithms exploit the Fourier transform in some way. In Shor's algorithm,
sampling from the quantum Fourier spectrum is used to discover periodicity of
the modular exponentiation function. In a generalization of this idea, quantum
Fourier sampling can be used to discover hidden subgroup structures of some
functions much more efficiently than it is possible classically. Another
problem for which the Fourier transform has been recruited successfully on a
quantum computer is the hidden shift problem. Quantum algorithms for hidden
shift problems usually have a slightly different flavor from hidden subgroup
algorithms, as they use the Fourier transform to perform a correlation with a
given reference function, instead of sampling from the Fourier spectrum
directly. In this paper we show that hidden shifts can be extracted efficiently
from Boolean functions that are quadratic forms. We also show how to identify
an unknown quadratic form on n variables using a linear number of queries, in
contrast to the classical case were this takes Theta(n^2) many queries to a
black box. What is more, we show that our quantum algorithm is robust in the
sense that it can also infer the shift if the function is close to a quadratic,
where we consider a Boolean function to be close to a quadratic if it has a
large Gowers U_3 norm.

has been also conjectured that spectrum of this theory is equivalent to the
hypermultiplet spectrum of a certain D=4 Seiberg-Witten theory. We find that
the correspondence actually extends beyond hypermultiplets in D=4, and that
many of the relevant indices match. However, a D=2 BPS state is typically
mapped to several different kind of dyons whose individual supermultiplets are
rather complicated; the match of index comes about only after summing over

absorbed. This effect leads to an enhancement in the azimuthal correlations of
the two-to-three with respect to the two-to-two parton-processes when comparing
to the same processes in proton-proton collisions since in average the particle

Higgs splitting (HS) and the D-term splitting (DR3) models. Each generically
predicts light gluinos and heavy squarks, with an inverted scalar mass

decays to final states with large b-jet multiplicity. For 0.2 fb^-1 of
integrated luminosity, we find a 5 sigma discovery reach of m(gluino) ~ 400 GeV
even if missing transverse energy, E_T^miss, is not a viable cut variable, by
examining the multi-b-jet final state. A corroborating signal should stand out
in the opposite-sign (OS) dimuon channel in the case of the HS model; the DR3
model will require higher integrated luminosity to yield a signal in the OS
dimuon channel. This region may also be probed by the Tevatron with 5-10 fb^-1
of data, if a corresponding search in the multi-b+ E_T^miss channel is
performed. With higher integrated luminosities of ~1 fb^-1, using E_T^miss plus
a large multiplicity of b-jets, LHC should be able to discover Yukawa-unified
SUSY with m(gluino) up to about 630 GeV. Thus, the year 1 LHC reach for
Yukawa-unified SUSY should be enough to either claim a discovery of the gluino,

transmit nodes transmit uncorrelated waveforms. Each receive node applies
compressive sampling to the received signal to obtain a small number of
samples, which the node subsequently forwards to a fusion center. Assuming that
the targets are sparsely located in the angle- Doppler space, based on the
samples forwarded by the receive nodes the fusion center formulates an
l1-optimization problem, the solution of which yields target angle and Doppler
information. The proposed approach achieves the superior resolution of MIMO
radar with far fewer samples than required by other approaches. This implies
power savings during the communication phase between the receive nodes and the
fusion center. Performance in the presence of a jammer is analyzed for the case
of slowly moving targets. Issues related to forming the basis matrix that spans

find shorter delays between corresponding shocks in more closely related

suggests an endogeneous sectorial dynamics during the mid-2003 economic

involving cold atoms loaded in a hollow-core optical fiber, where the atomic
system provides a tunable nonlinearity that can be large even at a
single-photon level. In particular, we show that when the interaction between
photons is effectively repulsive, the transmission of multi-photon components
of the field is suppressed. This leads to anti-bunching of the transmitted
light and indicates that the system acts as a single-photon switch. On the
other hand, in the case of attractive interaction, the system can exhibit
either anti-bunching or bunching, which is in stark contrast to semiclassical
calculations. We show that the bunching behavior is related to the resonant
excitation of bound states of photons inside the system.

scales as $f_nl^2$. The resultant scaling on the triangular shape is consistent
with that predicted by Jeong & Komatsu based on perturbation theory. We
systematically investigate this dependence with varying redshifts and halo mass
thresholds. It is shown that the $f_nl$ dependence of the halo bispectrum is
stronger for more massive haloes at higher redshifts. This feature can be a
useful discriminator of inflation scenarios in future deep and wide galaxy

phase transition, and they could very likely be the candidate of cold quark
matter if survived the cooling of the later Universe, although the formation
and evolution of these SQNs depend on the physical state of the hot QGP
(quark-gluon plasma) phase and the state of cold quark matter. We reconsider
the possibility of SQNs as cold dark matter, and find that the formation of
black holes in primordial halos could be significantly different from the
standard scenario. In a primordial halo, the collision between gas and SQNs
could be frequent enough, and thus the viscosity acting on each SQN would
decrease its angular momentum and make it to sink into the center of the halo,
as well as heat the gas. The SQNs with baryon numbers less than $10^{35}$ could
assemble in the center of the halo before the formation of primordial stars. A
black hole could form by merger of these SQNs, and then its mass could quickly
become about $10^3\ M_\odot$ or higher, by accreting the surrounding SQNs or

response to a number of stresses like attacks by pests or pathogens and
wounding by animals. Some recent experiments provide significant new knowledge
on the molecular detail and connectivity of the pathway. The pathway has two
major components in the form of feedback loops, one negative and the other
positive. We construct a minimal mathematical model, incorporating the feedback
loops, to study the dynamics of the JA signaling pathway. The model exhibits
transient gene expression activity in the form of JA pulses in agreement with
experimental observations. The dependence of the pulse amplitude, duration and
peak time on the key parameters of the model is determined computationally. The
deterministic and stochastic aspects of the pathway dynamics are investigated
using both the full mathematical model as well as a reduced version of it. We
also compare the mechanism of pulse formation with the known mechanisms of
pulse generation in some bacterial and viral systems.

revealed interesting excesses. Many authors suggested particle Dark Matter (DM)
annihilations could be at the origin of these effects. In this paper, we
critically assess this interpretation by reviewing some results questioning the
naturalness and robustness of such an interpretation. Natural values for the DM
particle parameters lead to a poor leptons production so that models often
require signal enhancement effects that we constrain here. Considering DM
annihilations are likely to produce antiprotons as well, we use the PAMELA
antiproton to proton ratio measurements to constrain a possible exotic
contribution. We also consider the possibility of an enhancement due to a
nearby clump of DM. This scenario appears unlikely when compared to the
state-of-the-art cosmological N-body simulations. We conclude that the bulk of
the observed signals most likely has no link with DM and is rather a new, yet
unconsidered source of background for searches in these channels.

  Part 1: Basic Concepts and Assertions","15 pages, 1 figure",,,,"physics.atom-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we analyze again a transition from the classical to quantum
description of bound charged particles, which involves a substantial
modification of the structure of their electromagnetic (EM) fields related to
the well-known fact that bound micro-particles do not radiate in sta-tionary
energy states. We show that a simple exclusion of the radiative component of EM
field produced by bound particles leads to a violation of the energy-momentum
conservation law, if the non-radiative EM field is left unmodified. In order to
restore the energy-momentum conservation, we make a closer look at the
interaction of two hypothetical classical charges with the prohibited radiation
component of their EM field and bring the appropriate modifications in the
structure of their bound EM field and, accordingly, in the Hamilton function of
this system. In comparison with the common Hamilton function for the one-body
problem, the electric interaction energy is multiplied by the Lorentz factor of
orbiting charged particle, and its rest mass m is replaced by an effective rest
mass parameter, which includes the interaction EM energy. We introduce, as a
novel postulate, these replacements into the Dirac equation for the bound
electron and show that the solution of the modified Dirac Coulomb equation
gives the same gross and fine structure of energy levels, as the one furnished
by the conventional approach, for hydrogen-like atoms. The correction to
spin-spin splitting of 1S state of hydrogen and heavier atoms is much smaller
than nuclear structure contribution and can be ignored. However, as discussed
in the part 2 of this paper, our approach does induce corrections to the energy
levels at the scale of hyperfine interactions, which at once remove a number of
long-standing discrepancies between theory and experiment in the atomic
physics.

based on a novel approach, involving the requirement of energy-momentum
conservation for the bound electromagnetic (EM) field, when the EM radiation is
forbidden. It has been shown that the modified expression for the energy levels
of hydrogenic atoms within such a pure bound field theory (PBFT) provides the
same gross and fine structure of energy levels, like in the standard theory. At
the scale of hyperfine interactions our approach, in general, evokes important
corrections to the energy levels. Part of such corrections, like the spin-spin
splitting in hydrogen, is less than the present theoretical uncertainty in the
evaluation of hyperfine contributions into the atomic levels. But the most
interesting result is the appearance of a number of significant corrections,
which improve the convergence between theory and experiment. In particular, the
corrected 1S-2S interval and 1S spin-spin splitting in positronium reduce the
existing up to date discrepancy between theoretical and experimental data. The
re-estimated classic 2S-2P Lamb shift in the hydrogen atom lead to the proton
charge radius rp=0.841(6) fm, which perfectly agrees with the latest estimation
of proton size via the measurement of 2S-2P Lamb shift in muonic hydrogen, i.e.

description of diffusive heterostructures comprising superconducting elements,
namely, the Usadel equations for isotropic Green's functions. Since the
quasiclassical and isotropic approximations break down close to interfaces, the
Usadel equations have to be supplemented with boundary conditions for isotropic
Green's functions (BCIGF), which are not derivable within the quasiclassical
description. For a long time, the BCIGF were available only for spin-degenerate
tunnel contacts, which posed a serious limitation on the applicability of the
Usadel description to modern structures containing ferromagnetic elements. In
this article, we close this gap and derive spin-dependent BCIGF for a contact
encompassing superconducting and ferromagnetic correlations. This finally
justifies several simplified versions of the spin-dependent BCIGF, which have
been used in the literature so far. In the general case, our BCIGF are valid as
soon as the quasiclassical isotropic approximation can be performed. However,
their use require the knowledge of the full scattering matrix of the contact,
an information usually not available for realistic interfaces. In the case of a
weakly polarized tunnel interface, the BCIGF can be expressed in terms of a few
parameters, i.e. the tunnel conductance of the interface and five
conductance-like parameters accounting for the spin-dependence of the interface
scattering amplitudes. In the case of a contact with a ferromagnetic insulator,
it is possible to find explicit BCIGF also for stronger polarizations. The
BCIGF derived in this article are sufficienly general to describe a variety of
physical situations and may serve as a basis for modelling realistic
nanostructures.

thought to be the remaining core of a disrupted dwarf galaxy, as expected
within the model of hierarchical merging. It contains several stellar
populations having different heavy elemental abundances supplied by supernovae
-- a process known as metal enrichment. Although M22 appears to be similar to
omega Cen, other peculiar globular clusters do not. Therefore omega Cen and M22
are viewed as exceptional, and the presence of chemical inhomogeneities in
other clusters is seen as `pollution' from the intermediate-mass
asymptotic-giant-branch stars expected in normal globular clusters. Here we
report Ca abundances for seven globular clusters and compare them to omega Cen.
Calcium and other heavy elements can only be supplied through numerous
supernovae explosions of massive stars in these stellar systems, but the
gravitational potentials of the present-day clusters cannot preserve most of
the ejecta from such explosions. We conclude that these globular clusters, like
omega Cen, are most probably the relics of more massive primeval dwarf galaxies

two atomic states but may induce considerable phase shifts. The acquired phases
are usually calculated by using the adiabatic-elimination approximation. We
analyze the accuracy of this approximation and derive the conditions for its
applicability to the calculation of the phases. We account for various sources
of imperfections, ranging from higher terms in the adiabatic-elimination
expansion and irreversible population loss to couplings to additional states.
We find that, as far as the phase shifts are concerned, the adiabatic
elimination is accurate only for a very large detuning. We show that the
adiabatic approximation is a far more accurate method for evaluating the phase
shifts, with a vast domain of validity; the accuracy is further enhanced by
superadiabatic corrections, which reduce the error well below $10^{-4}$.
Moreover, owing to the effect of adiabatic population return, the adiabatic and
superadiabatic approximations allow one to calculate the phase shifts even for
a moderately large detuning, and even when the peak Rabi frequency is larger
than the detuning; in these regimes the adiabatic elimination is completely
inapplicable. We also derive several exact expressions for the phases using
exactly soluble two-state and three-state analytical models.

type of particle clustering (tangling clustering of inertial particles) in a
stably stratified turbulence with imposed mean vertical temperature gradient.
In this stratified turbulence a spatial distribution of the mean particle
number density is nonuniform due to the phenomenon of turbulent thermal
diffusion, that results in formation of a gradient of the mean particle number
density, \nabla N, and generation of fluctuations of the particle number
density by tangling of the gradient, \nabla N, by velocity fluctuations. The
mean temperature gradient, \nabla T, produces the temperature fluctuations by
tangling of the gradient, \nabla T, by velocity fluctuations. These
fluctuations increase the rate of formation of the particle clusters in small
scales. In the laboratory stratified turbulence this tangling clustering is
much more effective than a pure inertial clustering that has been observed in
isothermal turbulence. In particular, in our experiments in oscillating grid
isothermal turbulence in air without imposed mean temperature gradient, the
inertial clustering is very weak for solid particles with the diameter 10
microns and Reynolds numbers Re =250. Our theoretical predictions are in a good
agreement with the obtained experimental results.

\tau_{AC} = -20 +/- 4, and \Delta \tau_{AD} = 23 +/- 4 days (\Delta \tau_{ij} =

delays for lens systems are often used to obtain the Hubble constant (H_0), the
unavailability of the spectroscopic lens redshift (z_l) in the system H1413+117
prevents a determination of H_0 from the measured delays. In this paper, the
new time delay constraints and a concordance expansion rate (H_0 = 70 km s^{-1}

an annular junction with two 0-$\pi$ boundaries. Within each 0 or $\pi$ segment

more classical framework, we show that time-abstract bisimulation is not

suffix equivalence based on the encoding of trajectories through words. We show
that this suffix equivalence is in general a correct abstraction for games. We
apply this result to o-minimal hybrid systems, and get decidability and
computability results in this framework. For the second framework which assumes
a partial observation of the dynamics of the system, we propose another

temperature of 620 K, column densities of NH~10E19 cm^-2, and most of them are

the question what formalism should be chosen. Another problem is that we need a
well-grounded procedure of constructing a generator of transformations in phase
space for all gravitational variables including gauge ones. It suggests the
notion of extended phase space. After analyzing the situation, we show that
Hamiltonian formulation in extended phase space is a real alternative to Dirac

space is straightforward and leads to a new description of quantum Universe in

least two dust shells are clearly present, one at \sim 1000 K and the other at
\sim 400 K; they dominate the emission in the IR; 2) the radio data are
explained by thermal self-absorbed emission from the reverse shock between the
stars; while 3) the data in the long wavelength tail come from the expanding
shock outwards the system; 4) in some symbiotic stars, the contribution from
the WD in the UV is directly seen. Finally, 5) for some objects soft X-ray
emitted by bremsstrahlung downstream of the reverse-shock between the stars are
predicted. The results thus confirm the validity of the colliding wind model
and the important role of the shocks. The comparison of the fluxes calculated
at the nebula with those observed at Earth reveals the distribution throughout
the system of the different components, in particular the nebulae and the dust

larger radii are found at larger periods. Moreover, the temperatures of the

flatness which decorrelates curvature determination from dark energy. We

presence follows Poisson flow on the primary structure; implying that, their
occurrence profile is rare, random and accidental. Structural class-specific
statistical analyses of sequence intervals between consecutive occurrences of
3(10) and Pi-helices revealed that these could be best described by gamma and
exponential distributions, across structural classes. Comparative study of
normalized percentage of non-glycine and non-proline residues in 3(10), Pi and
alpha-helices revealed a considerably higher proportion of 3(10) and Pi-helix
residues in disallowed, generous and allowed regions of Ramachandran map. Probe
into these findings in the light of evolution suggested clearly that 3(10) and
Pi-helices should appropriately be viewed as evolutionary intermediates on long
time scale, for not only the {\alpha}-helical conformation but also for the
'turns', equiprobably. Hence, accidental and random nature of occurrences of
3(10) and Pi-helices, and their evolutionary non-conservation, could be
described and explained from an invariant quantitative framework. Extent of
correctness of two previously proposed hypotheses on 3(10) and Pi-helices, have
been investigated too. Alongside these, a new algorithm to differentiate

small number of linear measurements. One of the main challenges in compressed
sensing is to find the support of a sparse signal. In the literature, several
bounds on the scaling law of the number of measurements for successful support
recovery have been derived where the main focus is on random Gaussian
measurement matrices. In this paper, we investigate the noisy support recovery
problem from an estimation theoretic point of view, where no specific
assumption is made on the underlying measurement matrix. The linear
measurements are perturbed by additive white Gaussian noise. We define the
output of a support estimator to be a set of position values in increasing
order. We set the error between the true and estimated supports as the
$\ell_2$-norm of their difference. On the one hand, this choice allows us to
use the machinery behind the $\ell_2$-norm error metric and on the other hand,
converts the support recovery into a more intuitive and geometrical problem.
First, by using the Hammersley-Chapman-Robbins (HCR) bound, we derive a
fundamental lower bound on the performance of any \emph{unbiased} estimator of
the support set. This lower bound provides us with necessary conditions on the
number of measurements for reliable $\ell_2$-norm support recovery, which we
specifically evaluate for uniform Gaussian measurement matrices. Then, we
analyze the maximum likelihood estimator and derive conditions under which the
HCR bound is achievable. This leads us to the number of measurements for the
optimum decoder which is sufficient for reliable $\ell_2$-norm support
recovery. Using this framework, we specifically evaluate sufficient conditions
for uniform Gaussian measurement matrices.

degree $\mathsf c (H)$ of $H$ is the smallest integer $N$ with the following

exist factorizations $z = z_0, ..., z_k = z'$ of $a$ such that, for each $i \in

one operator, the unintegrated chiral superpotential. In the quantum theory
this term receives an admixture by a second operator, the Yang-Mills part of
the Lagrangian. It has long been debated whether this ""anomalous"" contribution
is affected by higher loop corrections. We present a first principles
calculation at the second non-trivial order in perturbation theory using
supersymmetric dimensional reduction as a regulator and renormalisation by
Z-factors. Singular higher loop corrections to the renormalisation factor of
the Yang-Mills term are required if the conformal properties of two-point
functions are to be met. These singularities take the form determined in
preceding work on rather general grounds. Moreover, we also find non-vanishing
finite terms.

correlator which is accomplished by the Laporta algorithm. Apart from several

gravitational wake it excites in the ambient medium. We study the effects of
the presence of a boundary on dynamical friction by studying analytically the
interaction of perturber with uniform rectilinear motion in a uniform
homogeneous medium with a reflecting planar boundary. Wake reflection at a
medium's boundary may occur at the edges of truncated disks perturbed by
planetary or stellar companions as well as in numerical simulations of
planet-disk interaction with no-outflow boundary conditions. In this paper, we
show that the presence of the boundary modifies the behaviour of dynamical
friction significantly. We find that perturbers are invariably pushed away from
the boundary and reach a terminal subsonic velocity near Mach 0.37 regardless
of initial velocity. Dynamical friction may even be reversed for Mach numbers
less than 0.37 thereby accelerating instead of decelerating the perturber.
Perturbers moving parallel to the boundary feel additional friction orthogonal
to the direction of motion that is much stronger than the standard friction
along the direction of motion. These results indicate that the common use of
the standard Chandrasekhar formula as a short hand estimate of dynamical
friction may be inadequate as observed in various numerical simulations.

determine non-perturbative Wilson coefficients on the lattice, as a step
towards a completely non-perturbative determination of the nucleon structure.
In this talk we discuss how these Wilson coefficients can be used to extract
Nachtmann moments of structure functions, using the case of off-shell
Landau-gauge quarks as a first simple example. This work is done using overlap
fermions, because their improved chiral properties reduce the difficulties due
to operator mixing.

CMS experiment has been studied using muons from cosmic ray events collected
during the commissioning of the detector in 2008. The properties of the system
are extensively tested and compared with the simulation. The effect of the
random arrival time of the cosmic rays on the trigger performance is reported,
and the results are compared with the design expectations for proton-proton
collisions and with previous measurements obtained with muon beams.

bipartite continuous variable quantum system is studied. The problem is treated
within a system-plus-reservoir approach. The considered model reproduces the
conventional Brownian motion when the two particles are far apart and induces
an effective interaction between them, depending on the choice of the spectral
function of the bath. The coupling between the system and the environment
guarantees the translational invariance of the system in the absence of an
external potential. The entanglement between the particles is measured by the
logarithmic negativity, which is shown to monotonically decrease with the
increase of the temperature. A range of finite temperatures is found in which
entanglement is still induced by the reservoir.

barrel muon system and reports the main results obtained with data collected
during a high statistics cosmic ray data-taking period. The main goal of the
calibration is to determine, for each drift cell, the minimum time delay for
signals relative to the trigger, accounting for the drift velocity within the
cell. The accuracy of the calibration procedure is influenced by the random
arrival time of the cosmic muons relative to the LHC clock cycle. A more
refined analysis of the drift velocity was performed during the offline
reconstruction phase, which takes into account this feature of cosmic ray
events.
