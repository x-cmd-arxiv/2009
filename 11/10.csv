strongly coupled field theories using holography. For this purpose, we
introduce a general class of gravity duals to superconducting theories that
exhibit various types of phase transitions (first or second order with both
mean and non-mean field behavior) as parameters in their Lagrangian are
changed. Moreover the size and strength of the conductivity coherence peak can
also be controlled. Our results suggest that certain parameters in the
gravitational dual control the interactions responsible for binding the
condensate and the magnitude of its fluctuations close to the transition.

z~8 Y-dropout galaxies derived from deep/wide-area WFC3/IR data of the Early
Release Science, the ultradeep HUDF09, and wide-area NICMOS data. We fit
stellar population synthesis models to the SEDs to derive mean redshifts,
stellar masses, and ages. The z~7 galaxies are best characterized by
substantial ages (>100 Myr) and M/L_V~0.2. The main trend with decreasing
luminosity is that of bluing of the far-UV slope from beta~-2.0 to beta~-3.0.
This can be explained by decreasing metallicity, except for the lowest
luminosity galaxies (0.1 L*{z=3}), where low metallicity and smooth SFHs fail
to match the blue far-UV and moderately red H-[3.6] color. Such colors may
require episodic SFHs with short periods of activity and quiescence (""on-off""
cycles) and/or a contribution from emission lines. The stellar mass of our
sample of z~7 star forming galaxies correlates with SFR according to log M* =
8.70 (+-0.09) + 1.06(+-0.10) log SFR, implying star formation may have
commenced at z>10. No galaxies are found with SFRs much higher or lower than
the past averaged SFR suggesting that the typical star formation timescales are
probably a substantial fraction of the Hubble time. We report the first IRAC
detection of Y-dropout galaxies at z~8. The average rest-frame U-V=0.3 (AB) of
the 3 galaxies are similar to faint z~7 galaxies, implying similar M/L. The

destination D connected through two non-interfering half-duplex relays, R1 and
R2, is considered. In the literature of Information Theory, this configuration
is known as the diamond channel. In this setup, four transmission modes are
present, namely: 1) S transmits, and R1 and R2 listen (broadcast mode), 2) S
transmits, R1 listens, and simultaneously, R2 transmits and D listens. 3) S
transmits, R2 listens, and simultaneously, R1 transmits and D listens. 4) R1,
R2 transmit, and D listens (multiple-access mode). Assuming a constant power
constraint for all transmitters, a parameter $\Delta$ is defined, which
captures some important features of the channel. It is proven that for
$\Delta$=0 the capacity of the channel can be attained by successive relaying,
i.e, using modes 2 and 3 defined above in a successive manner. This strategy
may have an infinite gap from the capacity of the channel when $\Delta\neq$0.
To achieve rates as close as 0.71 bits to the capacity, it is shown that the
cases of $\Delta$>0 and $\Delta$<0 should be treated differently. Using new
upper bounds based on the dual problem of the linear program associated with
the cut-set bounds, it is proven that the successive relaying strategy needs to
be enhanced by an additional broadcast mode (mode 1), or multiple access mode
(mode 4), for the cases of $\Delta$<0 and $\Delta$>0, respectively.
Furthermore, it is established that under average power constraints the
aforementioned strategies achieve rates as close as 3.6 bits to the capacity of
the channel.

sufficient condition for stabilizer states that violate the LU-LC conjecture is
missing. In this paper, we investigate further the properties of stabilizer
states with respect to local equivalence. Our first result shows that there
exist infinitely many stabilizer states which violate the LU-LC conjecture. In
particular, we show that for all numbers of qubits $n\geq 28$, there exist
distance two stabilizer states which are counterexamples to the LU-LC
conjecture. We prove that for all odd $n\geq 195$, there exist stabilizer
states with distance greater than two which are LU equivalent but not LC
equivalent. Two important classes of stabilizer states that are of great
interest in quantum computation are the cluster states and stabilizer states of
the surface codes. To date, the status of these states with respect to the

restrictions, both these classes of states preclude any counterexamples. In
this context, we also show that the associated surface codes do not have any
encoded non-Clifford transversal gates. We characterize the CSS surface code

making connection with an important open problem in binary matroid theory, this

has been demonstrated for Euler flows when the divergence in the fluid
velocities is suitably restricted so as to prevent the formation of cavitation
in the flow.
  We also focus on the construction of multidimensionally upwinded electric
fields for divergence-free magnetohydrodynamical flows. A robust and efficient
second order accurate numerical scheme for two and three dimensional Euler and
magnetohydrodynamic flows is presented. The scheme is built on the current
multidimensional Riemann solver. The number of zones updated per second by this
scheme on a modern processor is shown to be cost competitive with schemes that
are based on a one-dimensional Riemann solver. However, the present scheme
permits larger timesteps.

Furthermore, the analysis of the Cucchieri-Mendes bounds is performed

If the first do not give a clear answer about the value of D(0), the second

NGC 5286, which has recently been suggested to be associated with the Canis
Major dwarf spheroidal galaxy. 57 variable stars were detected, only 19 of
which had previously been known. Among our detections one finds 52 RR Lyrae (22
RRc and 30 RRab), 4 LPV's, and 1 type II Cepheid of the BL Herculis type.
Periods are derived for all of the RR Lyrae as well as the Cepheid, and BV
light curves are provided for all the variables.
  The mean period of the RRab variables is <Pab> = 0.656 days, and the number
fraction of RRc stars is N(c)/N(RR) = 0.42, both consistent with an Oosterhoff
II (OoII) type -- thus making NGC 5286 one of the most metal-rich ([Fe/H] =
-1.67; Harris 1996) OoII globulars known to date. The minimum period of the
\RRab's, namely Pab,min = 0.513 d, while still consistent with an OoII
classification, falls towards the short end of the observed Pab,min
distribution for OoII globular clusters. As was recently found in the case of
the prototypical OoII globular cluster M15 (NGC 7078), the distribution of
stars in the Bailey diagram does not strictly conform to the previously
reported locus for OoII stars.
  We provide Fourier decomposition parameters for all of the RR Lyrae stars
detected in our survey, and discuss the physical parameters derived therefrom.
The values derived for the RRc's are not consistent with those typically found
for OoII clusters, which may be due to the cluster's relatively high
metallicity -- the latter being confirmed by our Fourier analysis of the
ab-type RR Lyrae light curves. We derive for the cluster a revised distance
modulus of (m-M)V = 16.04 mag. (ABRIDGED)

and their derived star formation rates from the H-alpha and 24um flux, one
object belongs to the class of dust-obscured star-forming red galaxies, while
the other is evolved with little ongoing star formation. This result represents
the first red and mainly passively evolving galaxy to be confirmed as companion
galaxies in a z>2 proto-cluster. Both red galaxies in PKS1138-262 are massive,
of the order of 4-6x10^11 M_Sol. They lie along a Colour-Magnitude relation
which implies that they formed the bulk of their stellar population around z=4.

non-interacting Kohn-Sham (KS) system under the influence of different Peierls
phases {\em and} of a pairing field. An extended Keldysh formalism for the

the short- and long-time response of the KS system. The equivalence between the

numerically solve the static BdG equations with a generalized wave-guide
approach and their time-dependent version with an embedded Crank-Nicholson
scheme. To demonstrate the feasibility of the propagation scheme we study two
paradigmatic models, the single-level quantum dot and a tight-binding chain,
under dc, ac and pulse biases. We provide a time-dependent picture of single

exploited to generate a zero-bias ac current of tunable frequency, and find a
long-living resonant effect induced by microwave irradiation of appropriate
frequency.

arise from temporal fluctuations or from spatial correlations, both neglected

of the whole source. The pc-scale resolution provided by the VLBA data allows
us to resolve the source structure in several sub-components. The analysis of
their synchrotron spectra showed that the source components have steep spectral
indices, suggesting that no supply/re-acceleration of fresh particles is
currently taking place in any region of the source. By assuming the
equipartition magnetic field of 4 mG, we found that only electrons with
$\gamma$ < 600, are still contributing to the radio spectrum, while electrons

lifetime we derived is 2700+/-600 years. Considering the best fit to the

is modelled with a particle-in-cell simulation in one spatial dimension and
with a high statistical plasma representation. The simulation direction is
orthogonal to the beam velocity vector. Both electron beams have initially
equal densities, temperatures and moduli of their nonrelativistic mean
velocities. The FI is electromagnetic in this case. A previous study of a small
filament demonstrated, that the magnetic pressure gradient force (MPGF) results
in a nonlinearly driven electrostatic field. The probably small contribution of
the thermal pressure gradient to the force balance implied, that the
electrostatic field performed undamped oscillations around a background
electric field. Here we consider larger filaments, which reach a stronger
electrostatic potential when they saturate. The electron heating is enhanced
and electrostatic electron phase space holes form. The competition of several
smaller filaments, which grow simultaneously with the large filament, also
perturbs the balance between the electrostatic and magnetic fields. The
oscillations are damped but the final electric field amplitude is still
determined by the MPGF.

framework of finite temperature quantum field theory. We demonstrate that the
mass equation we find has non-trivial solutions only for special classes of
potentials, and only within certain temperature intervals. We give most of our
results for the Ratra-Peebles Dark Energy (DE) potential. The thermal
(temporal) evolution of the model is analyzed. Following the time arrow, the
stable, metastable and unstable phases are predicted. The model predicts that
the present Universe is below its critical temperature and accelerates. At the
critical point the Universe undergoes a first-order phase transition from the
(meta)stable oscillatory regime to the unstable rolling regime of the DE field.
This conclusion agrees with the original idea of quintessence as a force making
the Universe roll towards its true vacuum with zero \Lambda-term. The present
MaVaN scenario is free from the coincidence problem, since both the DE density
and the neutrino mass are determined by the scale M of the potential. Choosing
M ~ 10^{-3} eV to match the present DE density, we can obtain the present
neutrino mass in the range m ~ 10^{-2}-1 eV and consistent estimates for other
parameters of the Universe.

electrostatic effects induced by these interfaces are taken into account:
surface charge induced electrostatic field, solvation energies due to the ionic
cloud, and image charge repulsion. Our variational equations thus go beyond the
mean-field theory. The influence of salt concentration, ion valency, dielectric
jumps, and surface charge is studied in two geometries. i) A single neutral
air-water interface with an asymmetric electrolyte. A charge separation and
thus an electrostatic field gets established due to the different image charge
repulsions for coions and counterions. Both charge distributions and surface
tension are computed and compared to previous approximate calculations. For
symmetric electrolyte solutions close to a charged surface, two zones are
characterized. In the first one, with size proportional to the logarithm of the
coupling parameter, strong image forces impose a total ion exclusion, while in
the second zone the mean-field approach applies. ii) A symmetric electrolyte
confined between two dielectric interfaces as a simple model of ion rejection
from nanopores. The competition between image charge repulsion and attraction
of counterions by the membrane charge is studied. For small surface charge, the
counterion partition coefficient decreases with increasing pore size up to a
critical pore size, contrary to neutral membranes. For larger pore sizes, the
whole system behaves like a neutral pore. The prediction of the variational

simpler for analysis and numerical simulations of KWs than the Biot-Savart

the nonlinear dynamics of KWs. Secondly, we show that the previously suggested

irrelevant, because it is based upon an erroneous assumption of the locality of

interatomic (intermolecular) process the excess energy is transferred to
neighboring species. The asymptotic expression for the cross section of this
process is derived. We demonstrate by explicit examples that under realizable
conditions the cross section of this interatomic process can clearly dominate
that of photorecombination.

storage by super-capacitors, water desalination and purification by capacitive
deionization (or desalination), and capacitive extraction of renewable energy
from a salinity difference. Here, we present a unified mean-field theory for
capacitive charging and desalination by ideally polarizable porous electrodes
(without Faradaic reactions or specific adsorption of ions) in the limit of
thin double layers (compared to typical pore dimensions). We illustrate the
theory in the case of a dilute, symmetric, binary electrolyte using the
Gouy-Chapman-Stern (GCS) model of the double layer, for which simple formulae
are available for salt adsorption and capacitive charging of the diffuse part
of the double layer. We solve the full GCS mean-field theory numerically for
realistic parameters in capacitive deionization, and we derive reduced models
for two limiting regimes with different time scales: (i) In the
""super-capacitor regime"" of small voltages and/or early times where the porous
electrode acts like a transmission line, governed by a linear diffusion
equation for the electrostatic potential, scaled to the RC time of a single
pore. (ii) In the ""desalination regime"" of large voltages and long times, the
porous electrode slowly adsorbs neutral salt, governed by coupled, nonlinear
diffusion equations for the pore-averaged potential and salt concentration.

inter- and circumstellar molecules. Observational studies show that polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are abundantly present in the ISM in the gas
phase. It is likely that these non-volatile species freeze out onto dust grains
as well and participate in the astrochemical solid-state network, but
experimental PAH ice studies are largely lacking. Methods. Near UV/VIS
spectroscopy is used to track the in situ VUV driven photochemistry of pyrene
containing ices at temperatures ranging from 10 to 125 K. Results. The main
photoproducts of VUV photolyzed pyrene ices are spectroscopically identified
and their band positions are listed for two host ices, \water and CO. Pyrene
ionisation is found to be most efficient in \water ices at low temperatures.
The reaction products, triplet pyrene and the 1-hydro-1-pyrenyl radical are
most efficiently formed in higher temperature water ices and in low temperature
CO ice. Formation routes and band strength information of the identified
species are discussed. Additionally, the oscillator strengths of Py, Py^+ and
PyH are derived and a quantitative kinetic analysis is performed by fitting a
chemical reaction network to the experimental data. Conclusions. Pyrene is
efficiently ionised in water ice at temperatures below 50 K. Hydrogenation
reactions dominate the chemistry in low temperature CO ice with trace amounts
of water. The results are put in an astrophysical context by determining the
importance of PAH ionisation in a molecular cloud. The photoprocessing of a
sample PAH in ice described in this manuscript indicates that PAH
photoprocessing in the solid state should also be taken into account in
astrochemical models.

construct a model with the assumption that the probability of citation is a

distributions indicate that both the adjusted indegree and outdegree

which are generally accepted to be black holes. Precise observations of orbital
motion near candidate black holes have the potential to determine if they have
the spacetime structure that general relativity demands. As a means of
formulating measurements to test the black hole nature of these objects,
Collins and Hughes introduced ""bumpy black holes"": objects that are almost, but
not quite, general relativity's black holes. The spacetimes of these objects
have multipoles that deviate slightly from the black hole solution, reducing to
black holes when the deviation is zero. In this paper, we extend this work in
two ways. First, we show how to introduce bumps which are smoother and lead to
better behaved orbits than those in the original presentation. Second, we show
how to make bumpy Kerr black holes -- objects which reduce to the Kerr solution
when the deviation goes to zero. This greatly extends the astrophysical
applicability of bumpy black holes. Using Hamilton-Jacobi techniques, we show
how a spacetime's bumps are imprinted on orbital frequencies, and thus can be
determined by measurements which coherently track a small orbiting body's
orbital phase. We find that weak-field orbits of bumpy black holes are modified
exactly as expected from a Newtonian analysis of a body with a prescribed
multipolar structure, reproducing well-known results from the celestial
mechanics literature. The impact of bumps on strong-field orbits is especially
strong, suggesting that this framework will allow observations to set robust
limits on the extent to which a spacetime's multipoles deviate from the black
hole expectation.

proved a sharp algorithmic characterization of such outcomes, but left open the
problem of how the actual bargaining process converges to them. A partial
answer was provided by Azar et al. who proposed a distributed algorithm for
constructing Nash bargaining solutions, but without polynomial bounds on its

this process, and study its convergence rate to Nash bargaining solutions. At
each time step, each player proposes a deal to each of her neighbors. The
proposal consists of a share of the potential profit in case of agreement. The
share is chosen to be balanced in Nash's sense as far as this is feasible (with
respect to the current best alternatives for both players). We prove that,
whenever the Nash bargaining solution is unique (and satisfies a positive gap
condition) this dynamics converges to it in polynomial time. Our analysis is
based on an approximate decoupling phenomenon between the dynamics on different

outperformed their peer groups over time. We conclude that systematic
outperformance, while it seems to exist, is quite rare worldwide.

explore the reliability of minimum light (V-R) colors as a tool for measuring
interstellar reddening. For each star, R-band intensity mean magnitudes and
light amplitudes are presented. Corresponding V-band light curves from the
literature are supplemented with the new photometry, and (V-R) colors at
minimum light are determined for a subset of these stars as well as for other
stars in the literature. Two different definitions of minimum light color are
examined, one which uses a Fourier decomposition to the V and R light curves to
find (V-R) at minimum V-band light, (V-R)_{min}^F, and the other which uses the
average color between the phase interval 0.5-0.8, (V-R)_{min}^{\phi(0.5-0.8)}.
  From 31 stars with a wide range of metallicities and pulsation periods, the
mean dereddened RR Lyrae color at minimum light is (V-R)_{min,0}^F = 0.28 pm
0.02 mag and (V-R)_{min,0}^{\phi(0.5-0.8)} = 0.27 pm 0.02 mag. As was found by
Guldenschuh et al. (2005) using (V-I) colors, any dependence of the star's
minimum light color on metallicity or pulsation amplitude is too weak to be
formally detected. We find that the intrinsic (V-R) of Galactic bulge RR Lyrae
stars are similar to those found by their local counterparts and hence that
Bulge RR0 Lyrae stars do not have anomalous colors as compared to the local RR
Lyrae stars.

sources of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). The recent results of Pierre
Auger observatory (PAO) have indicated a possible composition change of UHECRs
above ~10^{18.5} eV towards heavy nuclei. We show here that if indeed UHECRs
are largely heavy nuclei, then nearby radio quiet AGNs can also be viable
sources of UHECRs. We derive constraints on the acceleration sites which enable
acceleration of UHECRs to 10^{20} eV without suffering losses. We show that the
acceleration of UHECRs and the survival of energetic heavy nuclei are possible
in the parsec scale weak jets that are typically observed in these objects, the
main energy loss channel being photodisintegration. On this scale, energy
dissipation by shock waves resulting from interactions inside a jet or of the
jet with surrounding material are expected, which may accelerate the particles
up to very high energies. We discuss the possible contribution of radio-quiet
AGNs to the observed UHECR flux, and show that the required energy production
rate in UHECRs by a single object could be as low as ~ 3*10^{39} erg/s, which
is less than a percent of the bolometric luminosity, and thus energetically
consistent. We discuss consequences of this model, the main one being the
difficulty in detecting energetic secondaries (\gamma-rays and neutrinos) from

distribution is central to Bayesian model selection but is computationally
difficult. I argue that the marginal likelihood can be reliably computed from a
posterior sample by careful attention to the numerics of the probability
integral. Posing the expression for the marginal likelihood as a Lebesgue
integral, we may convert the harmonic mean approximation from a sample
statistic to a quadrature rule. As a quadrature, the harmonic mean
approximation suffers from enormous truncation error as consequence . In
addition, I demonstrate that the integral expression for the harmonic-mean
approximation converges slowly at best for high-dimensional problems with
uninformative prior distributions. These observations lead to two
computationally-modest families of quadrature algorithms that use the full
generality sample posterior but without the instability. The first algorithm
automatically eliminates the part of the sample that contributes large
truncation error. The second algorithm uses the posterior sample to assign
probability to a partition of the sample space and performs the marginal
likelihood integral directly. This eliminates convergence issues. The first
algorithm is analogous to standard quadrature but can only be applied for
convergent problems. The second is a hybrid of cubature: it uses the posterior
to discover and tessellate the subset of that sample space was explored and
uses quantiles to compute a representive field value. Neither algorithm makes
strong assumptions about the shape of the posterior distribution and neither is
sensitive outliers. [abridged]

of a long GRB 090726. We resolve a complicated profile of the optical light
curve. We also investigate the relation of the optical and X-ray emission of
this event. We make use of the optical photometry of this OA obtained by the
0.5 m telescope of AI AS CR, supplemented by the data obtained by other
observers, and the X-ray Swift/XRT data.
  The optical emission peaked at ~ 17.5 mag (R) at t-T0 ~ 500 s. We find a
complex profile of the light curve during the early phase of this OA: an
approximately power-law rise, a rapid transition to a plateau, a weak flare
superimposed on the center of this plateau, and a slowly steepening early
decline followed by a power-law decay. We discuss several possibilities to
explain the short flare on the flat top of the optical light curve at t-T0 ~
500 s; activity of the central engine is favored although reverse shock cannot
be ruled out. We show that power-law outflow with Theta_obs/Theta_c > 2.5 is
the best case for OA of GRB 090726. The initial Lorentz factor is Gamma_0 ~
230-530 in case of propagation of the blast wave in a homogeneous medium, while
propagation of this wave in a wind environment gives Gamma_0 ~ 80-300. The
value of Gamma_0 in GRB 090726 thus falls into the lower half of the range
observed in GRBs and it may even lie on the lower end. We also show that both
the optical and X-ray emission decayed simultaneously and that the spectral
profile from X-ray to the optical band did not vary. This OA belongs to the
least luminous ones in the phase of its power-law decay corresponding to that
observed for the ensemble of OAs of long GRBs.

modeling. The goal of this study is to assess the extent to which metal-poor
stars in the halo reflect the star formation conditions that occurred in halo
progenitor galaxies at high redshift, before and during the epoch of
reionization. Simple prescriptions that translate dark-matter halo mass into
baryonic gas budgets and star formation histories yield models that resemble
the observed Milky Way halo in its total stellar mass, metallicity
distribution, and the luminosity function and chemical enrichment of dwarf
satellite galaxies. These model halos in turn allow an exploration of how the
populations of interest for probing the epoch of reionization are distributed
in physical and phase space, and of how they are related to lower-redshift
populations of the same metallicity. The fraction of stars dating from before a
particular time or redshift depends strongly on radius within the galaxy,
reflecting the ""inside-out"" growth of cold-dark-matter halos, and on
metallicity, reflecting the general trend toward higher metallicity at later
times. These results suggest that efforts to discover stars from z > 6 - 10
should select for stars with [Fe/H] <~ -3 and favor stars on more tightly bound
orbits in the stellar halo, where the majority are from z > 10 and 15 - 40% are
from z > 15. The oldest, most metal-poor stars - those most likely to reveal
the chemical abundances of the first stars - are most common in the very center

have several implications for the larger project of constraining the properties

precise and robust constraint on the amplitude of the matter power spectrum at
low redshift that is available from our data. In combination with cluster
gas-mass fraction, cosmic microwave background, supernova and baryon acoustic
oscillation data, and incorporating conservative allowances for systematic
uncertainties, we limit the species-summed neutrino mass, M_nu, to <0.33 eV at
95.4 per cent confidence in a spatially flat, cosmological constant (LambdaCDM)
model. In a flat LambdaCDM model where the effective number of neutrino
species, N_eff, is allowed to vary, we find N_eff = 3.4 -0.5 +0.6 (68.3 per
cent confidence, incorporating a direct constraint on the Hubble parameter from
Cepheid and supernova data). We also obtain results with additional degrees of
freedom in the cosmological model, in the form of global spatial curvature
(Omega_k) and a primordial spectrum of tensor perturbations (r and n_t). The
results are not immune to these generalizations; however, in the most general
case we consider, in which M_nu, N_eff, curvature and tensors are all free, we
still obtain M_nu < 0.70 eV and N_eff = 3.7 +- 0.7 (at respectively the same
confidence levels as above). These results agree well with recent work using
independent data, and highlight the importance of measuring cosmic structure
and expansion at low as well as high redshifts. Although our cluster data
extend to redshift z=0.5, the effect of neutrino mass on the growth of
structure at late times is not yet detected at a significant level.

additional 27 slightly less extreme emission-line systems. These galaxies
represent a highly evolving class that may play an important role in the
decline of star formation since z~1, but their exact nature and evolutionary
pathways remain a mystery. Here, we use emission lines to determine
metallicities and ionization parameters, constraining their intrinsic
properties and state of star formation. Some LCBG metallicities are consistent
with a ""bursting dwarf"" scenario, while a substantial fraction of others are
not, further confirming that LCBGs are a highly heterogeneous population but
are broadly consistent with the intermediate redshift field. In agreement with
previous studies, we observe overall evolution in the luminosity-metallicity
relation at intermediate redshift. Our sample, and particularly the LCBGs,
occupy a region in the empirical R23-O32 plane that differs from luminous local
galaxies and is more consistent with dwarf Irregulars at the present epoch,
suggesting that cosmic ""downsizing"" is observable in even the most fundamental
parameters that describe star formation. These properties for our sample are
also generally consistent with lying between local galaxies and those at high
redshift, as expected by this scenario. Surprisingly, our sample exhibits no
detectable correlation between compactness and metallicity, strongly suggesting
that at these epochs of rapid star formation, the morphology of compact
star-forming galaxies is largely transient.

new neutron stars have been discovered, seven of which belong to the recently
identified ""rotating radio transients"" (RRATs) class. Here we describe our
search methodology, and discuss the new detections in terms of how the RRAT
population relates to the general population of pulsars. The new detections
indicate (1) that the galactic z-distribution of RRATs in the surveys closely
resembles the distribution of pulsars, with objects up to 0.86 kpc from the
galactic plane; (2) where measurable, the RRAT pulse widths are similar to that
of individual pulses from pulsars of similar period, implying a similar beaming
fraction; and (3) our new detections span a variety of nulling fractions, and
thus we postulate that the RRATs may simply be nulling pulsars that are only
""on"" for less than a pulse period. Finally, the newly discovered object PSR
J0941-39 may represent a link between pulsars and RRATs. This bizarre object
was discovered as an RRAT, but in follow-up observations often appeared as a
bright (~10 mJy) pulsar with a low nulling fraction. It is obvious therefore
that a neutron star can oscillate between being an RRAT and a pulsar.
Crucially, the sites of the RRAT pulses are coincident with the pulsar's
emission, implying that the two emission mechanisms are linked, and that RRATs
are not just pulsars observed from different orientations.

outlying HII regions from background galaxies whose strong emission lines
([OIII], Hbeta or [OII]) have been redshifted into the SINGG bandpass. We find
that these deep GALEX images can serve as a substitute for spectroscopic
follow-up because outlying HII regions separate cleanly from background
galaxies in color-color space. We identify seven SINGG systems with outlying
massive star formation that span a large range in Halpha luminosities
corresponding to a few O stars in the most nearby cases, and unresolved dwarf
satellite companion galaxies in the most distant cases. Six of these seven
systems feature galaxies with nearby companions or interacting galaxies.
Furthermore, our results indicate that some outlying HII regions are linked to
the extended-UV disks discovered by GALEX, representing emission from the most
massive O stars among a more abundant population of lower mass (or older) star
clusters. The overall frequency of outlying HII regions in this sample of
gas-rich galaxies is 8 - 11% when we correct for background emission-line
galaxy contamination (~75% of ELdots).

spirals can cause stellar migration, here we report that another mechanism is
also effective at mixing disks of barred galaxies. The resonance overlap of the
bar and spiral structure induces a nonlinear response leading to a strong
redistribution of angular momentum in the disk. We find that, depending on the
amplitudes of the perturbers, the changes in angular momentum, dL, could occur
up to an order of magnitude faster than in the case of recurrent spirals. The
signature of this mechanism is a bimodality in dL with maxima near the bar's
corotation and its outer Lindblad resonance; this is independent of the
properties of the spiral structure. For parameters consistent with the Milky
Way the disk mixes in about 3 Gyr and the stellar velocity dispersion increases
with time in a manner roughly consistent with observations. This new mechanism
could account for both the observed age-velocity relation and the absence of
age-metallicity relation in the solar neighborhood. Spiral-bar interaction
could also explain observations showing that strongly barred galaxies have
weaker metallicity gradients than weakly barred or non-barred galaxies.

main parameters of simulations of molecular cloud formation by the collision of
warm diffuse medium (WNM) cylindrical streams, neglecting stellar feedback and
magnetic fields. The parameters we vary are the Mach number of the inflow
velocity of the streams, Msinf, the rms Mach number of the initial background
turbulence in the WNM, and the total mass contained in the colliding gas
streams, Minf. Because the SFE is a function of time, we define two estimators
for it, the ""absolute"" SFE, measured at t = 25 Myr into the simulation's
evolution (sfeabs), and the ""relative"" SFE, measured 5 Myr after the onset of
star formation in each simulation (sferel). The latter is close to the ""star
formation rate per free-fall time"" for gas at n = 100 cm^-3. We find that both
estimators decrease with increasing Minf, although by no more than a factor of
2 as Msinf increases from 1.25 to 3.5. Increasing levels of background
turbulence similarly reduce the SFE, because the turbulence disrupts the
coherence of the colliding streams, fragmenting the cloud, and producing
small-scale clumps scattered through the numerical box, which have low SFEs.
Finally, the SFE is very sensitive to the mass of the inflows, with sferel
decreasing from ~0.4 to ~0.04 as the the virial parameter in the colliding
streams increases from ~0.15 to ~1.5. This trend is in partial agreement with
the prediction by Krumholz & McKee (2005), since the latter lies within the
same range as the observed efficiencies, but with a significantly shallower
slope. We conclude that the observed variability of the SFE is a highly
sensitive function of the parameters of the cloud formation process, and may be
the cause of significant scatter in observational determinations.

cascade of biochemical reactions (initiation, ribosome assembly, elongation,
etc.), the rate of which can be regulated by small non-coding microRNAs through
multiple mechanisms. It remains unclear what mechanisms of microRNA action are
most dominant: moreover, many experimental reports deliver controversal
messages on what is the concrete mechanism actually observed in the experiment.
Parker and Nissan (Parker and Nissan, RNA, 2008) demonstrated that it is
impossible to distinguish alternative biological hypotheses using the steady
state data on the rate of protein synthesis. For their analysis they used two
simple kinetic models of protein translation. In contrary, we show that
dynamical data allow to discriminate some of the mechanisms of microRNA action.
We demonstrate this using the same models as in (Parker and Nissan, RNA, 2008)
for the sake of comparison but the methods developed (asymptotology of
biochemical networks) can be used for other models. As one of the results of
our analysis, we formulate a hypothesis that the effect of microRNA action is
measurable and observable only if it affects the dominant system
(generalization of the limiting step notion for complex networks) of the
protein translation machinery. The dominant system can vary in different
experimental conditions that can partially explain the existing controversy of
some of the experimental data.

state. We focus on the physics of level degeneracy with electron number on the
dot. The physics of such a resonant level is governed by a $k$-channel Kondo
model when the quantum Hall state is a Read-Rezayi state at filling fraction
$\nu=2+k/(k+2)$ or its particle-hole conjugate at $\nu=2+2/(k+2)$. The
$k$-channel Kondo model is channel symmetric even without fine tuning any

asymmetric. The two limits exhibit non-Fermi liquid and Fermi liquid

parameters and analyze the kinematic, structural, and chemical properties of

remnant with a disc morphology as a result of the large gas-fraction of the
remnants. We show that stars formed during the merger (a sudden starburst occur
in our simulation and last for 0.2-0.3 Gyr) and those formed after the merger
have different kinematical and chemical properties. The first ones are located
in thick disc or the halo. They are partially supported by velocity dispersion
and have high [alpha/Fe] ratios even at metallicities as high as [Fe/H]=-0.5.
The former ones -- the young component -- are located in a thin disc
rotationally supported and have lower [alpha/Fe] ratios. The difference in the
rotational support of both components results in the rotation of the thick disc
lagging that of the thin disc by as much as a factor of two, as recently
observed.We find that, while the kinematic and structural properties of the

there is a remarkable uniformity in the chemical properties of the mergers.

the eruptive events of the 1840s (the great) and the 1890s (the minor)
eruptions suffered by the massive star $\eta$ Car. The two bipolar nebulae
commonly known as the Homunculus and the little Homunculus were formed from the
interaction of these eruptive events with the underlying stellar wind. As in
previous work (Gonzalez et al. 2004a, 2004b), we assume here an interacting,
nonspherical multiple-phase wind scenario to explain the shape and the
kinematics of both Homunculi, but adopt a more realistic parametrization of the
phases of the wind. During the 1890s eruptive event, the outflow speed {\it
decreased} for a short period of time. This fact suggests that the little
Homunculus is formed when the eruption ends, from the impact of the
post-outburst $\eta$ Car wind (that follows the 1890s event) with the eruptive
flow (rather than by the collision of the eruptive flow with the pre-outburst
wind, as claimed in previous models; Gonzalez et al. 2004a, 2004b). Our
simulations reproduce quite well the shape and the observed expansion speed of
the large Homunculus. The little Homunculus (which is embedded within the large
Homunculus) becomes Rayleigh-Taylor unstable and develop filamentary structures
that resembles the spatial features observed in the polar caps. In addition, we
find that the interior cavity between the two Homunculi is partially filled by
material that is expelled during the decades following the great eruption. This
result may be connected with the observed double-shell structure in the polar
lobes of the $\eta$ Car nebula. Finally, as in previous work, we find the
formation of tenuous, equatorial, high-speed features that seem to be related
to the observed equatorial skirt of $\eta$ Car.

not only the spacetime geometry but also the foliation. As a result, the
regularity condition at the center of a star is more restrictive than in
general relativity. Assuming that the energy density is a piecewise-continuous,
non-negative function of the pressure and that the pressure at the center is
positive, we prove that the momentum conservation law is incompatible with the
regularity at the center for any spherically-symmetric, static configurations.
The proof is totally insensitive to the structure of higher spatial curvature
terms and, thus, holds for any values of the dynamical critical exponent $z$.
Therefore, we conclude that a spherically-symmetric star should include a
time-dependent region near the center. We also comment on the condition under
which linear instability of the scalar graviton does not show up.

breaks steeper than 0.5, a situation also encountered in the jet of M87. This
likely indicates velocity and/or magnetic field gradients and more efficient
particle acceleration localized in the faster/higher magnetic field parts of
the flow. The magnetic field structure of the 3C 264 jet is remarkably smooth;

changes in the optical spectrum. We find that the X-ray emission is due to the

arises from each thin/dual-thin irreducible module of a Terwilliger algebra of
some $P$- and $Q$-polynomial association scheme, yet not previously studied. It
is particularly interesting that the Leonard pair associated to some code $C$
may belong to one family in the Askey scheme while the distance-regular graph
in which the code is found may belong to another.

massive halos and fewer large voids, although the scalings are not completely
degenerate with $\sigma_8$. Our results suggest that, in addition to their
abundances, halo and void density profiles may also provide interesting

problem with this method is that several of its steps involve ignoring error
terms of size comparable to the main term; amazingly, the errors seem to cancel
and the resulting prediction is expected to be accurate up to square-root
cancellation. We prove the accuracy of the Ratios Conjecture's prediction for
the 1-level density of families of cuspidal newforms of constant sign (up to
square-root agreement for support in (-1,1), and up to a power savings in
(-2,2)), and discuss the arithmetic significance of the lower order terms. This
is the most involved test of the Ratios Conjecture's predictions to date, as it
is known that the error terms dropped in some of the steps do not cancel, but
rather contribute a main term! Specifically, these are the non-diagonal terms
in the Petersson formula, which lead to a Bessel-Kloosterman sum which
contributes only when the support of the Fourier transform of the test function

volatility (playing the role of dispersion frequency coefficient), which can be
either fixed or stochastic, and adaptive market potential that depends on the
interest rate. The wave function represents quantum probability amplitude,
whose absolute square is probability density function. Four types of analytical
solutions of the NLS equation are provided in terms of Jacobi elliptic
functions, all starting from de Broglie's plane-wave packet associated with the
free quantum-mechanical particle. The best agreement with the Black-Scholes

combined with adaptive solitary-wave NLS-solution. Adjustable 'weights' of the

come to the so-called Manakov system of two coupled NLS equations (that admits

constant of recovery). Modifications of these parameters by auxiliary beta

the result of an experimental bias linked to the variable extent of G protein

produce alterations in channel kinetics, the two most important parameters are
the extents of initial block and recovery. These data emphasize the

LP subsystem (the randomness of the LP site energies). This is in contrast with
the conventional s-wave BCS superconductors, which according to the Anderson's
theorem are rather insensitive to the diagonal disorder (i.e. to nonmagnetic
impurities). It has been found that the disorder effects depend in a crucial
way on the total particle concentration n and the LP level position DELTA_o and
depending on the parameters the system can exhibit various types of
superconducting behaviour, including the LP-like, intermediate (MIXED)and the
'BCS'-like. In the extended range of {n,DELTA_o} the superconducting ordering
is suppressed by the randomness of the LP site energies and the increasing
disorder induces a changeover from the MIXEDlike behaviour to the BCS-like one,
connected with abrupt reduction of T_c and energy gap to zero. However, there
also exist a definite range of {n,DELTA_o} in which the increasing disorder has
a quite different effect: namely it can substantially enhance T_c or even lead
to the phenomenon which can be called disorder induced superconductivity.
Another interesting effect is a possibility of a disorder induced bound pair
formation of itinerant electrons, connected with the change-over to the LP-like
regime.

account of effects of dissipations. There are, however, problems in the
relativistic Navier-Stokes equations, i.e. the equations violate causality.
Israel-Stewart equations, which evade the problems of Navier-Stokes equations
by introducing new parameters, such as the relaxation times, have recently been
used in describing the space-time evolution of the quark-gluon plasma produced
in high energy heavy ion collisions. The viscosities and the relaxation times
are related to each other by imposing entropy constraints on the system.
According to Boltzmann-Einstein principle, the probability distribution of the
fluctuation in the energy-momentum tensor is related to the entropy of the
system. Applying this principle to the entropy in Israel-Stewart theory, one
can obtain the ratios of the viscosities to the relaxation times. We evaluate

function and the correlation functions at different stellar mass intervals of
the VVDS observation, where M_infall is the mass of the hosting halo at the
time when the galaxy was last the central galaxy. We find that for low mass
haloes, their residing central galaxies are less massive at high redshift than
those at low redshift. For high mass haloes, central galaxies in these haloes
at high redshift are a bit more massive than the galaxies at low redshift.
Satellite galaxies are less massive at earlier times, for any given mass of
hosting haloes. Fitting both the SDSS and VVDS observations simultaneously, we
also propose a unified model of the M_stars-M_infall relation, which describes
the evolution of central galaxy mass as a function of time. The stellar mass of
a satellite galaxy is determined by the same M_stars-M_infall relation of
central galaxies at the time when the galaxy is accreted. With these models, we
study the amount of galaxy stellar mass increased from z~0.8 to the present day
through galaxy mergers and star formation. Low mass galaxies gain their stellar
masses from z~0.8 to z=0 mainly through star formation. For galaxies of higher
mass, the increase of stellar mass solely through mergers from z=0.8 can make
the massive galaxies a factor ~2 larger than observed at z=0. We can also
predict stellar mass functions of redshifts up to z~3, and the results are

distribution appear in fractal distributions with box-counting dimension
smaller than three (its maximum value), whereas the lognormal void distribution

Moreover, voids of the former type persist in the continuum limit, namely, as
the number density of observable objects grows, giving rise to lacunar
fractals, whereas voids of the latter type disappear in the continuum limit,

describes two simple models of the slug flow regime by means of an equivalent
monophase flow with a non-constant density. The slug regime is modelled as a
monophase density-varying flow with a sinusoidal density, travelling along the
pipe itself towards the top end node of the riser. Starting from the bottom
end, it is characterized by adiabatic processes and energy loss along the

to be independent of the riser inclination, while in the second one a simple

an ion to state-dependent displacement operations interleaved with quantum coin
tossing operations. To analyze the ion's motional state after each step we
apply a technique that directly maps the probability density distribution onto
the ion's internal state. The measured probability distributions and the
position's second moment clearly show the non-classical character of the
quantum walk. To further highlight the difference between the classical
(random) and the quantum walk, we demonstrate the reversibility of the latter.
Finally, we extend the quantum walk by using two ions, giving the walker the
additional possibility to stay instead of taking a step.

Interestingly, the majority of our stars show a significant correlation between

so-called Ernst equation, is an integrable nonlinear PDE in two dimensions.
There now exists a general method for analyzing boundary value problems for
integrable PDEs, and this method consists of two steps: (a) Construct an
integral representation of the solution characterized via a matrix
Riemann-Hilbert (RH) problem formulated in the complex $k$-plane, where $k$
denotes the spectral parameter of the associated Lax pair. This representation
involves, in general, some unknown boundary values, thus the solution formula
is {\it not} yet effective. (b) Characterize the unknown boundary values by
analyzing a certain equation called the {\it global relation}. This analysis
involves, in general, the solution of a nonlinear problem; however, for certain
boundary value problems called linearizable, it is possible to determine the
unknown boundary values using only linear operations. Here, we employ the above
methodology for the investigation of certain boundary value problems for the
elliptic version of the Ernst equation. For this problem, the main novelty is
the occurence of the spectral parameter in the form of a square root and this
necessitates the introduction of a two-sheeted Riemann surface for the
formulation of the relevant RH problem. As a concrete application of the
general formalism, it is shown that the particular boundary value problem
corresponding to the physically significant case of a rotating disk is a
linearizable boundary value problem. In this way the remarkable results of
Neugebauer and Meinel are recovered.

randomly redistributed after any other fibre breaks under excessive load. The
model provides an exponential distribution of the internal stress and a
log-normal shaped distribution of failure stress, in agreement with

approaches mean field as the number of random neighbours $k$ becomes large and
also displays a failure strength which remains finite in the limit of infinite

of uncorrelation. All these macroscopic properties appear statistically stable
with respect to the choice of the chains' initial strength distribution. The
investigated model is relevant for all systems in which some generic external

turbulence regime and the theoretically predicted spectra for the direct energy
cascade and the inverse wave action cascade. The second type of model we study,
the Differential Approximation Model (DAM), takes a further drastic
simplification by assuming locality of interactions in $k$-space via a
differential closure that preserves the main scalings of the Kelvin wave
dynamics. DAMs are even more amenable to study and they form a useful tool by
providing simple analytical solutions in the cases when extra physical effects
are present, e.g. forcing by reconnections, friction dissipation and phonon
radiation. We study these models numerically and test their theoretical
predictions, in particular the formation of the stationary spectra, and the
closeness of the numerics for the higher-order DAM to the analytical

The phase accumulated between transitions (commonly known as the Stuckelberg

physical observables of the system exhibit periodic dependence on the various
system parameters. This phenomenon is often referred to as
Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg (LZS) interferometry. Phenomena related to LZS

with heterogeneous arbitrageurs and positive feedbacks leading to
self-reinforcing transient stochastic faster-than-exponential price dynamics.
As a result of the nonlinear feedbacks, the termination of a bubble is found to
be characterized by a finite-time singularity in the bubble price formation
process ending at some potential critical time $\tilde{t}_c$, which follows a
mean-reversing stationary dynamics. Because of the heterogeneity of the
rational agents' expectations, there is a synchronization problem for the
optimal exit times determined by these arbitrageurs, which leads to the
survival of the bubble almost all the way to its theoretical end time. The
explicit exact analytical solutions of the two models provide nonlinear
transformations which allow us to develop novel tests for the presence of
bubbles in financial time series. Avoiding the difficult problem of parameter
estimation of the stochastic differential equation describing the price
dynamics, the derived operational procedures allow us to diagnose bubbles that
are in the making and to forecast their termination time. The tests performed

rods allows one to deal with large numbers of particles, revealing a
phenomenology previously unseen in more complicated models, and moreover
distinctively different from both that of the purely polar case (e.g. the
Vicsek model) and of active nematics.

objects in young nearby star-forming regions and associations is continuously
increasing, offering the possibility to study the low-mass end of the IMF in
greater detail. In this paper, we present six new candidates for (very)
low-mass objects in the Taurus star-forming region one of which was recently
discovered in parallel by Luhman et al. (2009). The underlying data we use is
part of a new database from a deep near-infrared survey at the Calar Alto
observatory. The survey is more than four magnitudes deeper than the 2MASS
survey and covers currently ~1.5 square degree. Complementary optical
photometry from SDSS were available for roughly 1.0 square degree. After
selection of the candidates using different color indices, additional
photometry from Spitzer/IRAC was included in the analysis. In greater detail we
focus on two very faint objects for which we obtained J-band spectra. Based on
comparison with reference spectra we derive a spectral type of L2+/-0.5 for one
object, making it the object with the latest spectral type in Taurus known
today. From models we find the effective temperature to be 2080+/-140 K and the
mass 5-15 Jupiter masses. For the second source the J-band spectrum does not
provide a definite proof of the young, low-mass nature of the object as the
expected steep water vapor absorption at 1.33 micron is not present in the
data. We discuss the probability that this object might be a background giant
or carbon star. If it were a young Taurus member, however, a comparison to
theoretical models suggests that it lies close to or even below the deuterium
burning limit (<13 Jupiter masses) as well. A first proper motion analysis for
both objects shows that they are good candidates for being Taurus members.

stratified atmosphere with a small wind speed we show that the corresponding

way we give a simple `straightedge and compass' method to estimate the
intensity of sound upwind and downwind. We construct Mach envelopes for moving

squashed anti-de Sitter spacetime and discuss the $SO(3,1)\times \mathbb{R}$

lattices open a new perspective on quantum many-body physics. In these
experimental setups it is possible to study coherent time evolution of isolated
quantum systems. These dynamics reveal new physics beyond the low-energy
properties usually relevant in solid-state many-body systems. In this paper we
study the time evolution of antiferromagnetic order in the Heisenberg chain
after a sudden change of the anisotropy parameter, using various numerical and
analytical methods. As a generic result we find that the order parameter, which
can show oscillatory or non-oscillatory dynamics, decays exponentially except
for the effectively non-interacting case of the XX limit. For weakly ordered
initial states we also find evidence for an algebraic correction to the
exponential law. The study is based on numerical simulations using a numerical
matrix product method for infinite system sizes (iMPS), for which we provide a
detailed description and an error analysis. Additionally, we investigate in
detail the exactly solvable XX limit. These results are compared to
approximative analytical approaches including an effective description by the
XZ-model as well as by mean-field, Luttinger-liquid and sine-Gordon theories.
This reveals which aspects of non-equilibrium dynamics can as in equilibrium be
described by low-energy theories and which are the novel phenomena specific to
quantum quench dynamics. The relevance of the energetically high part of the
spectrum is illustrated by means of a full numerical diagonalization of the
Hamiltonian.

the case of observations taken at the vertices of a graph. This model includes
many familiar regression problems. This article discusses the use of the edges
of a graph to measure roughness in penalized regression. Distance between
estimate and observation is measured at every vertex in the $L_2$ norm, and
roughness is penalized on every edge in the $L_1$ norm. Thus the ideas of
total-variation penalization can be extended to a graph. The resulting
minimization problem presents special computational challenges, so we describe
a new, fast algorithm and demonstrate its use with examples.
  Further examples include a graphical approach that gives an improved estimate
of the baseline in spectroscopic analysis, and a simulation applicable to
discrete spatial variation. In our example, penalized regression outperforms
kernel smoothing in terms of identifying local extreme values. In all examples
we use fully automatic procedures for setting the smoothing parameters.
