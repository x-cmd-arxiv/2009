extragalactic distance and Galactic evolution for over a century. The Spitzer
Space Telescope has opened the possibility of extending the study of Cepheids
into the mid- and far-infrared, where interstellar extinction is reduced. We
have obtained photometry from images of a sample of Galactic Cepheids with the
IRAC and MIPS instruments on Spitzer. Here we present the first mid-infrared
period-luminosity relations for Classical Cepheids in the Galaxy, and the first
ever Cepheid period-luminosity relations at 24 and 70 um. We compare these
relations with theoretical predictions, and with period-luminosity relations
obtained in recent studies of the Large Magellanic Cloud. We find a significant
period-color relation for the [3.6]-[8.0] IRAC color. Other mid-infrared colors
for both Cepheids and non-variable supergiants are strongly affected by
variable molecular spectral features, in particular deep CO absorption bands.
We do not find strong evidence for mid-infrared excess caused by warm (~500 K)
circumstellar dust. We discuss the possibility that recent detections with
near-infrared interferometers of circumstellar shells around delta Cep, l Car,
Polaris, Y Oph and RS Pup may be a signature of shocked gas emission in a
dust-poor wind associated to pulsation-driven mass loss.

particles with spin 0 (so-called scalar particles) and 1/2 (electron/positron)
respectively. For a free particle, the Dirac equation is derived from the
Klein-Gordon equation by taking its square root in a bi-quaternionic formalism
fully justified by the first principles of the scale relativity theory. This is
no more true when an external electro-magnetic field comes into play. If one
tries to derive the electro-magnetic Dirac equation in a manner analogous to
the one used when this field is absent, one obtains an additional term which is
the relativistic analogue of the spin-magnetic field coupling term encountered
in the Pauli equation, valid for a non-relativistic particle with spin 1/2.
There is however a method to recover the standard form of the electro-magnetic
Dirac equation, with no additional term, which amounts modifying the way both
covariances involved here, quantum and scale, are implemented. Without going
into technical details, it will be shown how these results suggest this last
method is based on more profound roots of the scale relativity theory since it
encompasses naturally the spin-charge coupling.

valid over a large range of angular scales relevant for WMAP and Planck, as

vary from zero to one in one dimension and from zero to three in three

monodispersive sets, which are randomly oriented and placed. The scattering

shown that for a finite generation of the fractal, the exponent changes at

of star formation rate (SFR) for a sample of z = 0.84 galaxies from the High-z
Emission Line Survey (HiZELS). Using multi-wavelength diagnostics, we estimate
that 5 - 11 per cent of H-alpha emitters at this redshift are active galactic
nuclei. We detect 35 per cent of the H-alpha emitters individually at 24
microns, and stack the star-forming emitters on deep 24-micron images in order
to calculate the typical SFRs of our galaxies. These are compared to the
observed H-alpha line fluxes in order to estimate the extinction at z = 0.84,
and we find a significant increase in dust extinction for galaxies with higher
SFRs. We demonstrate that the local relationship between SFR and extinction is
suitable for our sample, and attribute the overall increase in dust extinction
for z = 0.84 galaxies to an increase in the average SFR, rather than to a
change in dust properties. We calculate the UV extinction, and find a similar
dependence on SFR, but no evidence for a 2175 angstrom UV bump in the dust
attenuation law. We calculate the conversion between the dust attenuation of
nebular and stellar radiation, gamma, and show that gamma = 0.50 +/- 0.14. The
extinction / SFR relationship is shown to be applicable to galaxies with a
range of morphologies and bulge-to-disk ratios, to both merging and non-merging
galaxies, and to galaxies within high- and low-density environments, implying
that it is a fundamental property of star-forming regions. In order to allow
future studies to correct for a SFR-dependent amount of dust extinction, we
present an equation to predict the extinction of a galaxy, based solely upon
its observed H-alpha luminosity, and use this to recalculate the H-alpha
luminosity function and star formation rate density at z = 0.84.

groups. At present, groups contain most of the galaxies and a significant
fraction of the overall baryon content of the universe. To explore the effects
of BH feedback on groups, we analyse two high resolution cosmological hydro
simulations from the OverWhelmingly Large Simulations project. While both
include galactic winds driven by supernovae, only one includes feedback from
BHs. We compare the properties of the simulated groups to a wide range of
observational data, including hot gas radial profiles and gas mass fractions
(fgas), luminosity-mass-temperature (L-M-T) scaling relations, K-band
luminosity of the group and its central brightest galaxy (CBG), SFRs and ages
of the CBG, and gas/stellar metallicities. Both runs yield entropy profiles
similar to the data, while the run without AGN feedback yields highly peaked
temperature profiles, in discord with the observations. Energy input from BHs
significantly reduces fgas for groups with masses less than ~10^14 Msun,
yielding fgas-T and L-T relations that are in agreement with the data. The run
without AGN feedback suffers from the well known overcooling problem; the
resulting K-band luminosities are much larger than observed. By contrast, the
run that includes BH feedback yields K-band luminosities and CBG SFRs and ages
in agreement with current estimates. Both runs yield very similar gas-phase
metallicities that match X-ray data, but they predict very different stellar
metallicities. Based on the above, galaxy groups provide a compelling case that
BH feedback is a crucial ingredient in the formation of massive galaxies.

observed in natural, social and technological sciences. Its study sheds light
on the relation between the structure and function of complex systems.
Generally speaking, modules are islands of highly connected nodes separated by
a relatively small number of links. Every module can have contributions of
links from any node in the network. The challenge is to disentangle these
contributions to understand how the modular structure is built. The main
problem is that the analysis of a certain partition into modules involves, in
principle, as many data as number of modules times number of nodes. To confront
this challenge, here we first define the contribution matrix, the mathematical
object containing all the information about the partition of interest, and
after, we use a Truncated Singular Value Decomposition to extract the best
representation of this matrix in a plane. The analysis of this projection allow
us to scrutinize the skeleton of the modular structure, revealing the structure
of individual modules and their interrelations.

rate coefficients for the collisional excitation of molecules. The performance
of such a tool can be evaluated by testing it on a dataset of
collisionally-induced transitions for which rate coefficients are already
known: the network is trained on a subset of that dataset and tested on the
remainder. Results obtained by this method are typically accurate to within a
factor ~ 2.1 (median value) for transitions with low excitation rates and ~ 1.7
for those with medium or high excitation rates, although 4% of the ANN outputs
are discrepant by a factor of 10 more. The results suggest that ANNs will be
valuable in extrapolating a dataset of collisional rate coefficients to include
high-lying transitions that have not yet been calculated. For the asymmetric
top molecules considered in this paper, the favored architecture is a
cascade-correlation network that creates 16 hidden neurons during the course of
training, with 3 input neurons to characterize the nature of the transition and
one output neuron to provide the logarithm of the rate coefficient.

differs from the case of DNA ($c_\mathrm{DNA}^{-0.25}$). The observed behavior
suggests that the relaxation in the kHz range reveals the de Gennes-Dobrynin
renormalized Debye screening length, and not the average size of the chain, as
the pertinent length scale. Similarly, with increasing added salt the
electrostatic contribution to the HA persistence length is observed to scale as
the Debye length, contrary to scaling pertinent to the Odijk-Skolnick-Fixman

negligible. UDM models of the dark sector are appealing because they evade the

and confirm the detection of the also PDR tracer HCO towards the starburst
galaxy NGC 253, claimed to be mainly dominated by shock heating and in an
earlier stage of evolution than M 82, the prototypical extragalactic PDR. Our
CO+ detection suffers from significant blending to a group of transitions of
13CH3OH, tentatively detected for the first time in the extragalactic
interstellar medium. These species are efficiently formed in the highly UV
irradiated outer layers of molecular clouds, as observed in the late stage
nuclear starburst in M 82. The molecular abundance ratios we derive for these
molecules are very similar to those found in M 82. This strongly supports the
idea that these molecules are tracing the PDR component associated with the
starburst in the nuclear region of NGC 253. A comparison with the predictions
of chemical models for PDRs shows that the observed molecular ratios are
tracing the outer layers of UV illuminated clouds up to two magnitudes of
visual extinction. Chemical models, which include grain formation and
photodissociation of HNCO, support the scenario of a photo-dominated chemistry
as an explanation to the abundances of the observed species. From this
comparison we conclude that the molecular clouds in NGC 253 are more massive
and with larger column densities than those in M 82, as expected from the
evolutionary stage of the starbursts in both galaxies.

attached to many results in various fields of mathematics and his complete
works in seven volumes have been available since the end of the XIXth century

his results may have fallen into oblivion, at least in part. We will try to
describe some of Jacobi's results on ordinary differential equations and the
available, published or unpublished material he left. We will then expose the
selective interests of his followers and their own contributions.
  There are in fact many interrelated results: a bound on the order of a
differential system, a necessary and sufficient condition, given by a
determinant, for the bound to be reached, an algorithm to compute the bound in
polynomial time, and processes for computing normal forms using as few
derivatives as possible.

rediscovered, sometimes independently of Jacobi's findings. In conclusion, we
give the state of the art and suggest some possible applications of Jacobi's

of states. This change can be made sufficient for the Fermi-level density of
states to satisfy the Stoner criterion, driving a transition locally at the
surface from a paramagnetic state to an itinerant ferromagnetic state above a
critical applied electric field, Ec. Furthermore, due to the second-order
nature of this transition, the surface magnetization of the ferromagnetic state
just above the transition exhibits a substantial dependence on electric field,
as the result of an enhanced magnetoelectric susceptibility. Using a linearized
Stoner model we explain the occurrence of the itinerant ferromagnetism and
demonstrate that the magnetic moment on the Pd surface follows a square-root
variation with electric field consistent with our first-principles

interest for infrared devices and high-temperature thermoelectric applications.
A deeper understanding of the atomic and electronic structure of these
materials is crucial for explaining, predicting, and optimizing their
properties, and to suggest new materials for better performance. In this work,
we present our first-principles studies of the energy bands associated with
various monovalent (Na, K, and Ag) and trivalent (Sb and Bi) impurities and
impurity clusters in PbTe, SnTe, and GeTe using supercell models. We find that
monovalent and trivalent impurity atoms tend to come close to one another and
form impurity-rich clusters, and the electronic structure of the host materials
is strongly perturbed by the impurities. There are impurity-induced bands
associated with the trivalent impurities that split off from the
conduction-band bottom with large shifts towards the valence-band top. This is
due to the interaction between the $p$ states of the trivalent impurity cation
and the divalent anion which tends to drive the systems towards metallicity.
The introduction of monovalent impurities (in the presence of trivalent
impurities) significantly reduces (in PbTe and GeTe) or slightly enhances (in
SnTe) the effect of the trivalent impurities. One, therefore, can tailor the
band gap and band structure near the band gap (hence transport properties) by
choosing the type of impurity and its concentration or tuning the
monovalent/trivalent ratio. Based on the calculated band structures, we are
able to explain qualitatively the measured transport properties of the whole
class of PbTe-, SnTe-, and GeTe-based bulk thermoelectrics.

the expectation values of Wilson loop operators which wrap the circle fibers of
M. Under localization, such a Wilson loop operator reduces naturally to the
Chern character of an associated universal bundle over the moduli space. Along

statistically independent extracted samples in the 1D spectrum, and preserves

account the effect of drop pressure on the apparent contact angle theta_{app}.
Also we determine the limiting pressure p_{W} which causes the impalement
transition to the Wenzel state and the pull-off pressure p_{out} at which the
drop detaches from the substrate. The calculations have been carried out for
axial-symmetric pillars of three different shapes: conical, hemispherical
topped and flat topped cylindrical pillars. Calculations show that, assuming
the same pillar spacing, conical pillars may be more incline to undergo an
impalement transition to the Wenzel state, but, on the other hand, they are
characterized by a vanishing pull-off pressure which causes the drop not to
adhere to the substrate and therefore to detach very easily. We infer that this
property should strongly reduce the contact angle hysteresis as experimentally
osberved in Ref. \cite{Martines-Conical-Shape}. It is possible to combine large
resistance to impalement transition (i.e. large value of p_{W}) and small (or
even vanishing) detaching pressure p_{out} by employing cylindrical pillars
with conical tips. We also show that depending on the particular pillar
geometry, the effect of drop pressure on the apparent contact angle theta_{app}
may be more or less significant. In particular we show that in case of conical
pillars increasing the drop pressure causes a significant decrease of
theta_{app} in agreement with some experimental investigations
\cite{LafunaTransitio}, whereas theta_{app} slightly increases for
hemispherical or flat topped cylindrical pillars.

formulation reveals explicitly and analytically the role of the delay between
the IR pulse and APT as a coherent control parameter. Our formulation also
shows the nearly equivalent roles of the delay and the carrier-envelope phase
in controlling the interference between different multiphoton pathways. We
illustrate these points by investigating the single ionization of He and
introduce dressed adiabatic hyperspherical potentials to aid the discussion. We
confirm the predictions with a full-dimensional, two-electron solution of the
time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation.

  Hilbert scale inequalities","16 pages",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spectral enhancement -- which aims to undo spectral broadening -- leads to
integral equations which are ill-posed and require special regularisation
techniques for their solution. Even when an optimal regularisation technique is
used, however, the errors in the solution -- which originate in data
approximation errors -- can be substantial and it is important to have good
bounds for these errors in order to select appropriate enhancement methods. A
discussion of the causes and nature of broadening provides regularity or source
conditions which are required to obtain bounds for the regularised solution of
the spectral enhancement problem. The source conditions do only in special
cases satisfy the requirements of the standard convergence theory for ill-posed
problems. Instead we have to use variable Hilbert scales and their
interpolation inequalities to get error bounds. The error bounds in this case
turn out to be of the form $O(\epsilon^{1-\eta(\epsilon)})$ where $\epsilon$ is
the data error and $\eta(\epsilon)$ is a function which tends to zero when
$\epsilon$ tends to zero. The approach is demonstrated with the Eddington
correction formula and applied to a new spectral reconstruction technique for
Voigt spectra. In this case $\eta(\epsilon)=O(1/\sqrt{|\log\epsilon|})$ is
found.

sufficiently small circumference $L$ of $S^{1}$. At small $L$, perturbation
theory may be used reliably to compute the effective potential for the Polyakov
loop $P$ in the compact direction. Periodic adjoint fermions act in opposition
to the gauge fields, which by themselves would lead to a deconfined phase at
small $L$. In order for the fermionic effects to dominate gauge field effects
in the effective potential, the fermion mass must be sufficiently small. This
indicates that chiral symmetry breaking effects are potentially important. We
develop a Polyakov-Nambu-Jona Lasinio (PNJL) model which combines the known
perturbative behavior of adjoint QCD models at small $L$ with chiral symmetry
breaking effects to produce an effective potential for the Polyakov loop $P$
and the chiral order parameter $\bar{\psi}\psi$. A rich phase structure emerges
from the effective potential. Our results are consistent with the recent
lattice simulations of Cossu and D'Elia, which found no evidence for a direct
connection between the small-$L$ and large-$L$ confining regions. Nevertheless,
the two confined regions are connected indirectly if an extended field theory

radio-spectrum sources associated to early-type galaxies up to redshift 2. Such
sources are most plausibly triggered by an AGN, but their observational
properties are not entirely consistent with those of standard radio galaxy
populations. In the present work we aim at a better understanding of the radio
spectra of such sources and ultimately of the nature of AGNs at sub-mJy flux
levels. We used the ATCA to get multi-frequency (4.8, 8.6 and 19 GHz)
quasi-simultaneous observations for a representative sub-sample of ATESP radio
sources associated with early-type galaxies (26 objects with S>0.6 mJy). This
can give us insight into the accretion/radiative mechanism that is at work,
since different regimes display different spectral signatures in the radio
domain. From the analysis of the radio spectra, we find that our sources are
most probably jet-dominated systems. ADAF models are ruled out by the high
frequency data, while ADAF+jet scenarios are still consistent with
flat/moderately inverted-spectrum sources, but are not required to explain the
data. We compared our sample with high (>20 GHz) frequency selected surveys,
finding spectral properties very similar to the ones of much brighter (S>500
mJy) radio galaxies extracted from the Massardi et al. (2008) sample. Linear
sizes of ATESP 5 GHz sources associated with early type galaxies are also often
consistent with the ones of brighter B2 and 3C radio galaxies, with possibly a
very compact component that could be associated at least in part to (obscured)
radio-quiet quasar-like objects and/or low power BL Lacs.

Observations of young stellar clusters with the Spitzer Space Telescope have
amassed mid-infrared spectral energy distributions for thousands of star-disk
systems from which transition disks can be identified. From a sample of 8
relatively nearby young regions (d <= 400 pc), we have identified about 20 such
objects, which we term ""classical"" transition disks, spanning a wide range of
stellar age and mass. We also identified two additional categories representing
more ambiguous cases: ""warm excess"" objects with transition-like spectral
energy distributions but moderate excess at 5.8 microns, and ""weak excess""
objects with smaller 24 micron excess that may be optically thin or exhibit
advanced dust grain growth and settling. From existing Halpha emission
measurements, we find evidence for different accretion activity among the three
categories, with a majority of the classical and warm excess transition objects
still accreting gas through their inner holes and onto the central stars, while
a smaller fraction of the weak transition objects are accreting at detectable
rates. We find a possible age dependence to the frequency of classical
transition objects, with fractions relative to the total population of disks in
a given region of a few percent at 1-2 Myr rising to 10-20% at 3-10 Myr. The
trend is even stronger if the weak and warm excess objects are included.
Classical transition disks appear to be less common, and weak transition disks
more common, around lower-mass stars (M <= 0.3 Msun).

M0-M9, with a total of about 206,000 spectra and a typical number of 3
exposures per object (ranging up to a maximum of 30 exposures). Using this
extensive data set we find that about 16% of the sources exhibit H-alpha
emission in at least one exposure, and of those about 45% exhibit H-alpha
emission in all of the available exposures. Within the sample of objects with
H-alpha emission, only 26% are consistent with non-variable emission,
independent of spectral type. The H-alpha variability, quantified in terms of
the ratio of maximum to minimum H-alpha equivalent width (R_EW), and the ratio
of the standard deviation to the mean (sigma_EW/<EW>), exhibits a rapid rise
from M0 to M5, followed by a plateau and a possible decline in M9 objects. In
particular, R_EW increases from a median value of about 1.8 for M0-M3 to about
2.5 for M7-M9, and variability with R_EW>10 is only observed in objects later
than M5. For the combined sample we find that the R_EW values follow an
exponential distribution with N(R_EW) exp[-(R_EW-1)/2]; for M5-M9 objects the
characteristic scale is R_EW-1\approx 2.7, indicative of stronger variability.
In addition, we find that objects with persistent H-alpha emission exhibit
smaller values of R_EW than those with intermittent H-alpha emission. Based on
these results we conclude that H-alpha variability in M dwarfs on timescales of
15 min to 1 hr increases with later spectral type, and that the variability is
larger for intermittent sources.

Comparison of the projection of the current choice of $\rho$ and the observed

regularisation), the maximal region of which is sought by the optimiser

all radiative and rescattering contributions, to leading accuracy in

one of the measured gluons and a projectile, or between the measured gluons

of the nuclear wavefunctions to obtain a compact result for inclusive two gluon
correlations in terms of the unintegrated gluon distributions in the nuclear
projectiles. The unintegrated gluon distributions satisfy the
Balitsky-Kovchegov equation, which we solve with running coupling and with
initial conditions constrained by existing data on electron-nucleus collisions.
Our results are valid for arbitrary rapidity separations between measured
gluons having transverse momenta $p_\perp,q_\perp\gtrsim \qs$, where $\qs$ is
the saturation scale in the nuclear wavefunctions. We compare our results to

functionally motivated. We define network community structure-based on the
function the network system is intended to perform. In particular, as a
specific example of this approach, we consider communities whose function is
enhanced by the ability to synchronize and/or by resilience to node failures.
Previous work has shown that, in many cases, the largest eigenvalue of the
network's adjacency matrix controls the onset of both synchronization and
percolation processes. Thus, for networks whose functional performance is
dependent on these processes, we propose a method that divides a given network
into communities based on maximizing a function of the largest eigenvalues of
the adjacency matrices of the resulting communities. We also explore the
differences between the partitions obtained by our method and the modularity
approach (which is based solely on consideration of network structure). We do
this for several different classes of networks. We find that, in many cases,
modularity-based partitions do almost as well as our function-based method in
finding functional communities, even though modularity does not specifically

ignoring absorption, calculating energy changes due to displacements of the

be complex. As a first step towards a better understanding of this situation we
consider in this paper the model of a dielectric as a collection of
oscillators, each of which is coupled to a reservoir giving rise to damping and
Langevin forces on the oscillators and a noise polarization acting as a source
of a fluctuating electromagnetic (EM) field in the dielectric. The model leads
naturally to expressions for the quantized EM fields that are consistent with
those obtained by different approaches, and also results in a
fluctuation-dissipation relation between the noise polarization and the
imaginary part of the permittivity; comparison with the Rytov
fluctuation-dissipation relation employed in the well-known Lifshitz theory for
the van der Waals (or Casimir) force shows that the Lifshitz theory is actually
a classical stochastic electrodynamical theory. The approximate classical
expression for the energy density in a band of frequencies at which absorption
in a dielectric is negligible is shown to be exact as a spectral thermal
equilibrium expectation value in the quantum-electrodynamical theory. Our main
result is the derivation of an expression for the QED energy density of a
uniform dispersive, absorbing media in thermal equilibrium. The spectral
density of the energy is found to have the same form with or without
absorption. We also show how the fluctuation-dissipation theorem ensures a
detailed balance of energy exchange between the (absorbing) medium, the

derive the stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF) down to ~1 Msun in order to test
whether the IMF in a massive metal-poor cluster is similar to that observed in
nearby young clusters and the field in our Galaxy. We estimate the mean age of
the cluster to be 3 Myr by combining our F160W photometry with previously
obtained HST WFPC2 optical F555W and F814W band photometry and comparing the
stellar locus in the color-magnitude diagram with main sequence and pre-main
sequence isochrones. The color-magnitude diagrams show the presence of
differential extinction and possibly an age spread of a few megayears. We
convert the magnitudes into masses adopting both a single mean age of 3 Myr
isochrone and a constant star formation history from 2 to 4 Myr. We derive the
IMF after correcting for incompleteness due to crowding. The faintest stars
detected have a mass of 0.5 Msun and the data are more than 50% complete
outside a radius of 5 pc down to a mass limit of 1.1 Msun for 3 Myr old
objects. We find an IMF of dN/dlog(M) M^(-1.20+-0.2) over the mass range
1.1--20 Msun only slightly shallower than a Salpeter IMF. In particular, we
find no strong evidence for a flattening of the IMF down to 1.1 Msun at a
distance of 5 pc from the center, in contrast to a flattening at 2 Msun at a
radius of 2 pc, reported in a previous optical HST study. We examine several
possible reasons for the different results. If the IMF determined here applies
to the whole cluster, the cluster would be massive enough to remain bound and
evolve into a relatively low-mass globular cluster.

sequences of relativistic polytropes, where the differential rotation is
described by the relativistic $j$-constant law. We show that a small degree of
differential rotation raises the critical rotation value for which the
quadrupolar f-mode becomes prone to the CFS instability, while the critical
value of $T/|W|$ at the mass-shedding limit is raised even more. For softer
equations of state these effects are even more pronounced. When increasing
differential rotation further to a high degree, the neutral point of the CFS
instability first reaches a local maximum and is lowered afterwards. For stars
with a rather high compactness we find that for a high degree of differential
rotation the absolute value of the critical $T/|W|$ is below the corresponding
value for rigid rotation. We conclude that the parameter space where the CFS
instability is able to drive the neutron star unstable is increased for a small
degree of differential rotation and for a large degree at least in stars with a
higher compactness.

correlated random potentials provide a simple yet nontrivial example of
disorder-induced multifractal measures. We introduce and discuss two
analytically tractable models for such potentials. The first model uses
multiplicative cascades and is equivalent to statistical mechanics of directed
polymers on disordered trees studied long ago by B. Derrida and H. Spohn.
Second model is the infinite-dimensional version of the problem in Euclidean
space which can be solved by employing the replica trick. In particular, the
latter version allows one to identify the freezing of multifractality exponents
with a mechanism of the replica symmetry breaking (RSB) and to elucidate its
physical meaning. The corresponding 1-step RSB solution turns out to be {\it
marginally stable} everywhere in the low-temperature phase. In the end we put
the model in a more general context by relating to the Gaussian Free Field and
briefly discussing recent developments and extensions. The appendices provide a
detailed exposition of the replica analysis of the model discussed in the
lectures.

the origin with irrational rationally independent rotation numbers
alpha_1,...,alpha_N. We adapt Yoccoz' renormalization of germs to this setting
to show that a Brjuno-type condition on simultaneous Diophantine
approximability of the rotation numbers is sufficient for simultaneous
linearizability of f_1,...,f_N. This generalizes a result of Moser's. In the
absence of periodic orbits we show that a weaker arithmetic condition analogous
to that of Perez-Marco's for the case of a single germ is sufficent for
linearizability. We also obtain lower bounds for the conformal radii of the
Siegel disks in both cases in terms of the arithmetic functions defining the
arithmetic conditions.

  Vectors","7 pages",,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Extreme-scale alignment of quasar optical polarization vectors at
cosmological scales ($z\le 2$) is also characterized by the rotation of mean
position angle $\chi$ with $\Delta \chi \approx 30^{\circ}$ per 1 Gpc. For
observing interval of $z$ the total rotation angle acquires the value $\sim
90^{\circ}$. We suggest the possible explanation of the half of this rotation
as a consequence of physical transformation of initially vertical magnetic
field ${\bf B}_{\|}$, directed along the normal ${\bf N}$ to the surface of
accretion disk, into the horizontal (perpendicular to ${\bf N}$) one. We found
asymptotical analytical expressions for axially averaged polarization degree
$p$ and mean position angle $\chi$ for various types of magnetized accretion
disks. We found also that during the evolution can be realized the case
$B_{\bot}\approx B_{\|}$ where position angle $\chi$ rotates from $45^{\circ}$
to zero. This rotation may occur during fairly great cosmological time
(corresponding to $\Delta z\sim 1-2$). The part of rotation $\sim \Delta \chi
\approx 45^{\circ}$ can be explained by a mechanism of alignment of
polarization vectors, say distribution of the part of quasars as a spiral in
the cosmic space with slow variation of rotation axis of corresponding
accretion disks. Both mechanisms are mutually related one with another.

line joining the two brightest galaxies and the direction toward the centre of
the LSC, i.e. Virgo cluster. These correlations suggest that two brightest
galaxies were formed in filaments of matter directed towards the

aggregation of galaxies around these two galaxies. The groups are formed on the

  We examine this problem under various assumptions on the set $X$ and on the

by closed sets, interval covers of linearly ordered sets and covers of
$\real^{n}$ by polyhedra and by arbitrary convex sets. We focus on these

reservoirs in normal, near-infrared selected (BzK) galaxies at z~1.5, based on
multi-configuration CO[2-1] observations obtained at the IRAM PdBI. Six of the
six galaxies observed were securely detected. High resolution observations
resolve the CO emission in four of them, implying sizes of order of 6-11 kpc
and suggesting the presence of rotation. The UV morphologies are consistent
with clumpy, unstable disks, and the UV sizes are consistent with the CO sizes.
The star formation efficiencies are homogeneously low and similar to local
spirals - the resulting gas depletion times are ~0.5 Gyr, much higher than what
is seen in high-z submm galaxies and quasars. The CO luminosities can be
predicted to within 0.15 dex from the star formation rates and stellar masses,
implying a tight correlation of the gas mass with these quantities. We use
dynamical models of clumpy disk galaxies to derive dynamical masses. These
models are able to reproduce the peculiar spectral line shapes of the CO
emission. After accounting for the stellar and dark matter masses we derive gas
masses of 0.4-1.2x10^11 Msun. The conversion factor is very high:
alpha_CO=3.6+-0.8, consistent with the Galaxy but four times higher than that
of local ultra-luminous IR galaxies. The gas accounts for an impressive 50-65%
of the baryons within the galaxies' half light radii. We are witnessing truly
gas-dominated galaxies at z~1.5, a finding that explains the high specific SFRs
observed for z>1 galaxies. The BzK galaxies can be viewed as scaled-up versions
of local disk galaxies, with low efficiency star formation taking place inside
extended, low excitation gas disks. They are markedly different than local
ULIRGs and high-z submm galaxies, which have more excited and compact gas.

As $R$ is changed from La, through Sm and Gd, to Tb, both the c-axis and a-axis

transition temperature ($T_S$) and $T_{N1}$ decrease monotonously. It is also
found that the temperature gap between $T_S$ and $T_{N1}$ becomes smaller when
