state and mass eigenstate vertex operators in bosonic string theory. By
minimally extending the standard definition of coherent states so as to include
the string theory requirements, we show that the naive construction of the the
closed string coherent states requires the existence of a lightlike
compactification of spacetime. When the null winding states in the underlying
Hilbert space are projected out the resulting vertex operators satisfy the
definition of a coherent state and have a classical interpretation. We present
explicitly both the covariant and lightcone gauge realization of the resulting
states using the DDF map that relates the two. We also identify the
corresponding general lightcone gauge classical solutions around which the
quantum states are fluctuating. We go on to show that both the covariant gauge
coherent vertex operators, the corresponding lightcone gauge coherent states
and the classical solutions all share the same mass and angular momenta and
conjecture that the covariant and lightcone gauge states are different
manifestations of the same state and share identical interactions. This
construction can be used to study the evolution of fundamental cosmic strings
as predicted by string theory and may also be useful for other applications
where massive string vertex operators are of interest.

stellar mass becomes bound and falls into the black hole, while the other half
is ejected at high velocity. Several previous studies have considered the
emission resulting from the accretion of bound material; we consider the
possibility that the unbound debris may also radiate once it has expanded and
become transparent. We show that the gradual energy input from hydrogen
recombination compensates for adiabatic loses over significant expansion
factors. The opacity also drops dramatically with recombination, and the
internal energy can be radiated by means of a cooling-transparency wave
propagating from the surface layers inward. The result is a brief optical
transient occurring ~1 week after disruption and lasting 3-5 days with peak
luminosities of 10^40-10^42 ergs/s, depending on the mass of the disrupted
star. These recombination powered transients should accompany the
x-ray/ultraviolet flare from the accretion of bound material, and so may be a
useful signature for discriminating tidal disruption events, especially for
lower and intermediate mass black holes.

phenomenology of theories with departures from Poincare' symmetry. We here
specialize these threshold studies to the case of a class of violations of
Poincare' symmetry which has been much discussed in the literature on
Horava-Lifshitz scenarios. These involve modifications of the energy-momentum
(""dispersion"") relation that may be different for different types of particles,
but always involve even powers of energy-momentum in the correction terms. We
establish the requirements for compatibility with the observed cosmic-ray

that the implications for the electron-positron pair-production threshold are
rather intriguing, in light of some recent studies of TeV emissions by Blazars.
Our findings should also provide motivation for examining the fate of the law
of energy-momentum conservation in Horava-Lifshitz-type theories.

a combination of dc and rf magnetron sputtering techniques. Cross-sectional
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed unmixed fifteen parallel and
alternate layers of Ti and Al with sharp interfaces, each measuring 27 nm and
15 nm in thickness, respectively. The Ti layer was composed of hcp and fcc
phases while the Al layer was fcc. Both x-ray diffraction (XRD) and selected
area electron diffraction (SAED) analysis confirmed the identity of these

fcc-Ti phase appeared when dual rf guns were used for Ti deposition and the
diffraction peak intensity corresponding to fcc phase increased when the gun
power was raised. A modified equation of state based thermodynamic analysis
confirmed that the formation of hcp phase as opposed to the thermodynamically
stable fcc phase of pure Ti is due to crystallite size reduction and not
impurity driven.

couldn't have imagined that the ""Ising model"" was to become a jewel in field of
equilibrium statistical mechanics. Its role spans the spectrum, from a good
pedagogical example to a universality class in critical phenomena. A quarter
century ago, Katz, Lebowitz and Spohn found a similar treasure. By introducing
a seemingly trivial modification to the Ising lattice gas, they took it into
the vast realms of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. An abundant variety
of unexpected behavior emerged and caught many of us by surprise. We present a
brief review of some of the new insights garnered and some of the outstanding
puzzles, as well as speculate on the model's role in the future of
non-equilibrium statistical physics.

alternative scenario involving a quark-nova (QN), an explosive transition of
the newly born neutron star to a quark star in which a second explosion
(delayed) occurs inside the already expanding ejecta of a normal SN. The
reheated SN ejecta can radiate at higher levels for longer periods of time
primarily due to reduced adiabatic expansion losses, unlike the standard SN
case. Our model is successfully applied to SN2006gy, SN2005gj, SN2005ap,
SN2008fz, SN2003ma with encouraging fits to the lightcurves. There are four
predictions in our model: (i) superluminous SNe optical lightcurves should show
a double-hump with the SN hump at weaker magnitudes occurring days to weeks
before the QN; (ii) Two shock breakouts should be observed vis-a-vis one for a
normal SN. Depending on the time delay, this would manifest as two distinct
spikes in the X-ray region or a broadening of the first spike for extremely
short delays; (iii) The QN deposits heavy elements of mass number A> 130 at the
base of the preceeding SN ejecta. These QN r-processed elements should be
visible in the late spectrum (few days-weeks in case of strong ejecta mixing)
of the superluminous SN; (iv) The QN yield will also contain lighter elements
(Hydrogen and Helium). We expect the late spectra to include H_alpha emission
lines that should be distinct in their velocity signature from standard H_alpha
emission.

only by a local counterterm as one shifts a U(1) factor between the
supergravity and gauge sectors.
  An immediate application of our formalism is the calculation of the one-loop

the overall efficiency of transport is optimized at a finite temporal
correlation that produces maximum overlap between the environmental power
spectrum and the excitonic energy differences, which in turn results in
enhanced driving of transitions between excitonic states.

Hadron Collider (LHC), two counter-rotating proton bunches were circulated for
the first time concurrently in the machine, at the LHC injection energy of 450
GeV per beam. Although the proton intensity was very low, with only one pilot
bunch per beam, and no systematic attempt was made to optimize the collision
optics, all LHC experiments reported a number of collision candidates. In the
ALICE experiment, the collision region was centred very well in both the
longitudinal and transverse directions and 284 events were recorded in
coincidence with the two passing proton bunches. The events were immediately
reconstructed and analyzed both online and offline. We have used these events
to measure the pseudorapidity density of charged primary particles in the
central region. In the range |$\eta$| < 0.5, we obtain dNch/deta = 3.10 $\pm$
0.13 (stat.) $\pm$ 0.22 (syst.) for all inelastic interactions, and dNch/deta =
3.51 $\pm$ 0.15 (stat.) $\pm$ 0.25 (syst.) for non-single diffractive
interactions. These results are consistent with previous measurements in
proton-antiproton interactions at the same centre-of-mass energy at the CERN

progress of the LHC accelerator, and of both the hardware and software of the

relationships among random variables in graphical models. Applications of these
models arise in the study of physical, as well as biological systems, where
directed edges between nodes represent the influence of components of the
system on each other. The general problem of estimating DAGs from observed data
is computationally NP-hard, Moreover two directed graphs may be observationally
equivalent. When the nodes exhibit a natural ordering, the problem of
estimating directed graphs reduces to the problem of estimating the structure
of the network. In this paper, we propose a penalized likelihood approach that
directly estimates the adjacency matrix of DAGs. Both lasso and adaptive lasso
penalties are considered and an efficient algorithm is proposed for estimation
of high dimensional DAGs. We study variable selection consistency of the two
penalties when the number of variables grows to infinity with the sample size.
We show that although lasso can only consistently estimate the true network
under stringent assumptions, adaptive lasso achieves this task under mild
regularity conditions. The performance of the proposed methods is compared to
alternative methods in simulated, as well as real, data examples.

Sitter-like (AdS-like) at infinity. Such manifolds are Lorentzian analogues of
the so-called Riemannian conformally compact (or asymptotically hyperbolic)
spaces, in the sense that the metric is conformal to a smooth Lorentzian metric
g^ on X, where C has a non-trivial boundary, in the sense that g=x^{-2}g^, with
x a boundary defining function. The boundary is conformally time-like for these
spaces, unlike asymptotically de Sitter spaces, which are similar but with the
boundary being conformally space-like.
  Here we show local well-posedness for the Klein-Gordon equation, and also
global well-posedness under global assumptions on the (null)bicharacteristic
flow, for lambda below the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound, (n-1)^2/4. These have
been known under additional assumptions, see the work of Breitenlohner-Freedman

  Further, we describe the propagation of singularities of solutions and obtain
the asymptotic behavior (at the boundary of X) of regular solutions. We also
define the scattering operator, which in this case is an analogue of the
hyperbolic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. Thus, it is shown that below the
Breitenlohner-Freedman bound, the Klein-Gordon equation behaves much like it
would for the conformally related metric, g^, with Dirichlet boundary
conditions, for which propagation of singularities was shown by Melrose,
Sj\""ostrand and Taylor, though the precise form of the asymptotics is
different.

provide a semantics for these choreographies, in which some roles may be played

containing local behaviors (strands) executed by regular (non-compromised)
principals. A skeleton is realized if it contains enough regular strands so
that it could actually occur, in combination with any possible activity of
compromised principals. It is delivery guaranteed (DG) realized if, in
addition, every message transmitted to a regular participant is also delivered.
We define a novel transition system on skeletons, in which the steps add
regular strands. These steps solve tests, i.e. parts of the skeleton that could
not occur without additional regular behavior. We prove three main results
about the transition system. First, each minimal DG realized skeleton is
reachable, using the transition system, from any skeleton it embeds. Second, if
no step is possible from a skeleton A, then A is DG realized. Finally, if a DG
realized B is accessible from A, then B is minimal. Thus, the transition system
provides a systematic way to construct the possible behaviors of the
choreography, in the presence of compromised principals.

coordination variables. Underlying our approach is an engine performing
(partial) constraint satisfaction of the sets of constraints. Our model extends
previous work on three counts: firstly, a more advanced notion of external
interaction is offered; secondly, our approach enables local satisfaction of
constraints with appropriate partial solutions, avoiding global synchronisation
over the entire constraints set; and, as a consequence, constraint satisfaction
can finally occur concurrently, and multiple parts of a set of constraints can
be solved and interact with the outside world in an asynchronous manner, unless
synchronisation is required by the constraints. This paper describes the
underlying logic, which enables a notion of local solution, and relates this
logic to the more global approach of our previous work based on classical
logic.

layers of modeling: Behavior, Interaction, and Priority. Behavior is
represented by labeled transition systems communicating through ports.
Interactions are sets of ports. A synchronization between components is
possible through the interactions specified by a set of connectors. When
several interactions are possible, priorities allow to restrict the
non-determinism by choosing an interaction, which is maximal according to some
given strict partial order.
  The BIP component framework has been implemented in a language and a
tool-set. The execution of a BIP program is driven by a dedicated engine, which
has access to the set of connectors and priority model of the program. A key
performance issue is the computation of the set of possible interactions of the
BIP program from a given state.
  Currently, the choice of the interaction to be executed involves a costly
exploration of enumerative representations for connectors. This leads to a
considerable overhead in execution times. In this paper, we propose a symbolic
implementation of the execution model of BIP, which drastically reduces this
overhead. The symbolic implementation is based on computing boolean
representation for components, connectors, and priorities with an existing BDD
package.

of the new Taurus members are likely to be brown dwarfs based on their late

it the first known L-type member of Taurus and the least massive known member
of the region (M=4-7 M_Jup). Another brown dwarf exhibits a flat infrared
spectral energy distribution, which indicates that it could be in the

a large edge-on disk (r=2.5=350 AU). The scattered light from this disk has
undergone significant variability on a time scale of days in optical images

at the disc-magnetosphere boundary, then matter flows into the ring-like
octupolar poles, forming ring-shape spots at the surface of the star above and
below equator. The light-curves are complex and may have two peaks per period.
In case where the dipole field dominates, matter accretes in two ordered funnel
streams towards poles, however the polar spots are meridionally-elongated due
to the action of the octupolar component. In the case when the fields are of
similar strengths, both, polar and belt-like spots are present. In many cases
the light-curves show the evidence of complex fields, excluding the cases of
small inclinations angles, where sinusoidal light-curve %is observed and
`hides' the information about the field complexity. We also propose new
mechanisms of phase shift in stars with complex magnetic fields. We suggest
that the phase shifts can be connected with: (1) temporal variation of the
star's intrinsic magnetic field and subsequent redistribution of main magnetic
poles; (2) variation of the accretion rate, which causes the disc to interact
with the magnetic fields associated with different magnetic moments. We use our
model to demonstrate these phase shift mechanisms, and we discuss possible
applications of these mechanisms to accreting millisecond pulsars and young
stars.

3.6-24um that were obtained during the cryogenic mission of the Spitzer Space
Telescope (46 deg^2) and have measured photometry for all known members of the
region that are within these data, corresponding to 348 sources. We have
classified the members of Taurus according to whether they show evidence of
disks and envelopes (classes I, II, and III). The disk fraction in Taurus is
75% for solar-mass stars and declines to 45% for low-mass stars and brown
dwarfs (0.01-0.3 M_sun). This dependence on stellar mass is similar to that
measured for Cha I, although the disk fraction in Taurus is slightly higher
overall, probably because of its younger age (1 vs. 2-3 Myr). In comparison,
the disk fraction for solar-mass stars is much lower (20%) in IC 348 and Sigma
Ori, which are denser than Taurus and Cha I and are roughly coeval with the
latter. These data indicate that disk lifetimes for solar-mass stars are longer
in regions that have lower stellar densities. Through an analysis of multiple
epochs of photometry that are available for ~200 Taurus members, we find that
stars with disks exhibit significantly greater mid-IR variability than diskless
stars. Finally, we have used our data in Taurus to refine the criteria for
primordial, evolved, and transitional disks. The number ratio of evolved and
transitional disks to primordial disks in Taurus is 15/98 for K5-M5, indicating
a timescale of 0.15 x tau(primordial)=0.45 Myr for the clearing of the inner
regions of optically thick disks. After applying the same criteria to older
clusters (2-10 Myr), we find that the proportions of evolved and transitional
disks in those populations are consistent with the measurements in Taurus when
their star formation histories are properly taken into account. ERRATUM: In
Table 7, we inadvertently omitted the spectral type bins in which class II
sources were placed in Table 8 based on their bolometric luminosities (applies
only to stars that lack spectroscopic classifications). The bins were K6-M3.5

mean masses within R_h,sc of the SC systems (SCSs) in low-mass disk galaxies
with M_d < 10^9 M_sun are found to evolve significantly with time owing to
dynamical friction of SCs. More massive SCs that can spiral-in to the central
regions of disks can form multiple SC systems with smaller velocity dispersions
so that they can merge with one another to form single stellar nuclei with
their masses comparable to ~0.4% of their host disk masses. Based on these

propounded. In effect, the theory dictates that the MOND potential phi produced
by a mass distribution rho is a solution of the Poisson equation for the
modified source density rho*=-(1/4 pi G)divergence(g), where g=nu(|gN|/a0)gN,
and gN is the Newtonian acceleration field of rho. This makes phi simply the
scalar potential of the algebraic acceleration field g. The theory thus
involves solving only linear differential equations, with one nonlinear,
algebraic step. It is derivable from an action, satisfies all the usual
conservation laws, and gives the correct center-of-mass acceleration to
composite bodies. The theory is akin in some respects to the nonlinear Poisson
formulation of Bekenstein and Milgrom, but it is different from it, and is
obviously easier to apply. The two theories are shown to emerge as natural
modifications of a Palatini-type formulation of Newtonian gravity, and are
members in a larger class of bi-potential theories.

demonstrate this by implementing the inversion-on-equality gate efficiently

propose new pulse sequences to implement the Parity gate and Fanout gate, which
are about 50% more efficient than the previous best efforts. Moreover, these
sequences are shown to require significantly less RF power for their
implementation. The proposed algorithm introduces several new features in the
conventional genetic algorithm framework. We use matrices instead of linear
chains, and the columns of these matrices have a well defined hierarchy. The
algorithm is a genetic algorithm coupled to a fast local optimizer, and is

  A photometric monitoring campaign on this star has previously revealed V-band
variability of up to 0.6 magnitudes but in 2009 the lightcurve is much flatter.
The Doppler image presented here is consistent with this low variability.
Calculating the flux predicted by the mapped spot distribution gives an
peak-to-peak variability of 0.04 magnitudes. The reduction in the amplitude of
the lightcurve, compared with previous observations, appears to be related to a
change in the distribution of the spots, rather than the number or area.

kinematical model is constructed for SN Ia 2003hv, which can account for the
main features in its optical, Near-Infrared (NIR), and Mid-Infrared (Mid-IR)
late-time spectra. It is found that an asymmetric off-center model can explain
the observed characteristics of SN 2003hv. This model includes a relatively
high density, Fe-rich region which displays a large velocity off-set, and a
relatively low density, extended 56Ni-rich region which is more spherically
distributed. The high density region consists of the inner stable Fe-Ni region
and outer 56Ni-rich region. Such a distribution may be the result of a
delayed-detonation explosion, in which the first deflagration produces the
global asymmetry in the innermost ejecta, while the subsequent detonation can
lead to the bulk spherical symmetry. This configuration, if viewed from the
direction of the off-set, can consistently explain the blueshift in some of the
emission lines and virtually no observed shift in other lines in SN 2003hv. For
this model, we then explore the effects of different viewing angles and the
implications for SNe Ia in general. The model predicts that a variation of the
central wavelength, depending on the viewing angle, should be seen in some
lines (e.g., [Ni II]7378), while the strongest lines (e.g., [Fe III] blend at
4700A) will not show this effect. By examining optical nebular spectra of 12
SNe Ia, we have found that such a variation indeed exists. We suggest that the
global asymmetry in the innermost ejecta, as likely imprint of the deflagration
flame propagation, is a generic feature of SNe Ia (abridged).

vapour is depleted by the emerging liquid phase. This imposes a limitation on
direct molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of nucleation by affecting the
properties of the vapour to a significant extent so that the nucleation rate
varies over simulation time. Grand canonical MD with McDonald's daemon is
discussed in the present contribution and applied for sampling both nucleation
kinetics and steady-state properties of a supersaturated vapour.
  The idea behind that approach is to simulate the production of clusters up to
a given size for a specified supersaturation. In that way, nucleation is
studied by a steady-state simulation. A series of simulations is conducted for
the truncated and shifted Lennard-Jones fluid which accurately describes the
fluid phase coexistence of noble gases and methane. The classical nucleation

deviate by two orders of magnitude from the nucleation rate below the triple

exhibits strong correlation decay under the condition that the absolute value
of ""inverse temperature"" is small. Due to strong correlation decay property, an
FPTAS for the partition function is presented under the same condition. This
condition is sharp for Ising model.

separated by a crossover, whose origin is attributed to the concurrent thermal
activation of spin and charge degrees of freedom: a thermally activated and a
re-entrant quenched-hole antiferromagnetic regime. The peculiar temperature and
hole density dependence of the magnetic moment m(h,T) fit a model with a (spin)
activation energy for the crossover between the two regimes throughout the
entire investigated range. The magnetic moment is suppressed by a simple
dilution mechanism both in the reentrant regime (0<h<0.056) and in the
so-called Cluster Spin Glass state coexisting with superconductivity
(0.056<h<0.08). We argue a common magnetic ground state for these two doping
regions and dub it quenched-hole antiferromagnet. Conversely frustration
prevails in the thermally activated regime, that vanishes at the same
concentration where superconductivity emerges, suggesting the presence of a
quantum critical point at h_c=0.056(2).

and reddening, N88 was observed using spectroscopy and imagery in the JHKs- and
L'-band at a spatial resolution of ~ 0.1-0.3"", using the VLT UT4 equipped with
the NAOS adaptive optics system. In order to attempt to establish if the origin
of the infra-red (IR) excess is due to bright nebulosity, circumstellar
material and/or local dust, we used Ks vs J-K colour-magnitude (CM) and JHK
colour-colour (CC) diagrams, as well as L' imagery.Our IR-data reveal in the
N88 area an IR-excess fraction of geq 30 per cent of the detected stars,as well
as an unprecedently detailed morphology of N88A. It consists of an embedded
cluster of ~3.5"" (~ 1 pc) in diameter, of at least thirteen resolved stars
superposed with an unusual bright continuum centered on a very bright star. The
four brightest stars in this cluster lie red-ward of H-K geq 0.45 mag, and
could be classified as young stellar object (YSO) candidates. Four other
probable YSO candidates are also detected in N88 along a south-north bow-shaped
thin H2 filament at ~ 7"" east of the young central bright star. At 0.2"" east of
this star, a heavily embedded core is detected that could be a massive class I
protostar candidate. The 2.12 mu H2 image of N88A resembles a shell of diameter
~ 3"" ~ 0.9 pc) centered on the bright star. The line ratios of H2 2-1 S(1) and
1-0 S(0) relative to 1-0 S(1), as well as the presence of high v lines, are
indicative of photodissociation regions, rather than shocks.

depending on the polar angle of the lepton tracks in the laboratory frame.
Typically leptons are detected in a defined angular range, with a dead zone in
the forward region. If the cutoffs imposed by the angular acceptance are
independent of the azimuth, at first sight they do not appear dangerous for a
measurement of the cos(2\phi)-asymmetry, relevant because of its association
with the violation of the Lam-Tung rule and with the Boer-Mulders function. On
the contrary, direct simulations show that up to 10 percent asymmetries are
produced by these cutoffs. These artificial asymmetries present qualitative
features that allow them to mimic the physical ones. They introduce some
model-dependence in the measurements of the cos(2\phi)-asymmetry, since a
precise reconstruction of the acceptance in the Collins-Soper frame requires a
Monte Carlo simulation, that in turn requires some detailed physical input to
generate event distributions. Although experiments in the eighties seem to have
been aware of this problem, the possibility of using the Boer-Mulders function
as an input parameter in the extraction of Transversity has much increased the
requirements of precision on this measurement. Our simulations show that the
safest approach to these measurements is a strong cutoff on the Collins-Soper
polar angle. This reduces statistics, but does not necessarily decrease the
precision in a measurement of the Boer-Mulders function.
