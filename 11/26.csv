hadron properties. Such expansions should exhibit marked improvement over the
conventional three-flavor chiral expansion. Although one can theoretically
formulate two-flavor theories for the various hyperon multiplets, the nearness
of kaon thresholds can seriously undermine the effectiveness of the
perturbative expansion in practice. We investigate the importance of virtual
kaon thresholds on hyperon properties, specifically their masses and isovector
axial charges. Using a three-flavor expansion that includes SU(3) breaking
effects, we uncover the underlying expansion parameter governing the
description of virtual kaon thresholds. For spin-half hyperons, this expansion
parameter is quite small. Consequently virtual kaon contributions are well
described in the two-flavor theory by terms analytic in the pion mass-squared.
For spin three-half hyperons, however, one is closer to the kaon production
threshold, and the expansion parameter is not as small. Breakdown of SU(2)
chiral perturbation theory is shown to arise from a pole in the expansion
parameter associated with the kaon threshold. Estimating higher-order
corrections to the expansion parameter is necessary to ascertain whether the
two-flavor theory of spin three-half hyperons remains perturbative. We find
that, despite higher-order corrections, there is a useful perturbative
expansion for the masses and isovector axial charges of both spin-half and spin
three-half hyperons.

in the J band to reach a Lyman-alpha luminosity limit of ~10^43.8 erg/s over a

  We used a set of archival K$_{\rm s}$-band infrared spectra of the
counterpart to EXO1722-363 obtained using ISAAC on the VLT, and
cross-correlated them in order to measure the radial velocity of the star.
  The resulting radial velocity curve has a semi-amplitude of $24.5 \pm 5.0$ km
s$^{-1}$. When combined with other measured parameters of the system, this
yields masses in the range 1.5 $\pm$ 0.4 - 1.6 $\pm$ 0.4 M$_{\odot}$ for the
neutron star and 13.6 $\pm$ 1.6 - 15.2 $\pm$ 1.9 M$_{\odot}$ for the B0--1 Ia
supergiant companion. These lower and upper limits were obtained under the
assumption that the system is viewed edge-on (i = 90$^\circ$) for the lower
limit and the supergiant fills its Roche lobe ($\beta = 1$) for the upper limit
respectively. The system inclination is constrained to $i>75^{\circ}$ and the
Roche lobe-filling factor of the supergiant is $\beta>0.9$. Additionally we
were able to further constrain our distance determination to be 7.1 $\le$ d
$\le$ 7.9 kpc for EXO1722-363. The X-ray luminosity for this distance range is
4.7 $\times$ 10$^{35}$ $\le$ L$_{\rm X}$ $\le$ 9.2 $\times$ 10$^{36}$ erg

  EXO1722-363 therefore becomes the seventh of the ten known eclipsing X-ray
binary pulsars for which a dynamical neutron star mass solution has been
determined. Additionally EXO1722-363 is the first such system to have a neutron
star mass measurement made utilising near-infrared spectroscopy.

shows that the theory underlying the effective field theory of gravity may have
no more degrees of freedom than is already contained in general relativity. We
show that the reason why an effective metric theory may describe just two

it changes from $h/2e^2$ to $h/e^2$ when the frequency (times $\hbar$) exceeds
the level spacing of the cavity; $h$ is the Planck constant and $e$ the

models of such shocks assume that they are steady and propagating perpendicular
to the magnetic field. Real shocks often violate both of these assumptions and
the media through which they propagate are inhomogeneous. We use the code
employed previously to produce the first time-dependent simulations of
fast-mode, oblique C-type shocks interacting with density perturbations. We
include a self-consistent calculation of the thermal and ionisation balances
and a fluid treatment of grains. We identify features that develop when a
multifluid shock encounters a density inhomogeneity to investigate whether any
part of the precursor region ever behaves in a quasi-steady fashion. If it does
the shock may be modelled approximately without solving the time-dependent
hydromagnetic equations. Simulations were made for initially steady oblique
C-type shocks encountering density inhomogeneities. For a semi-finite
inhomogeneity with a density larger than the surrounding medium, a transmitted
shock evolves from being J-type to a steady C-type shock on a timescale
comparable to the ion-flow time through it. A sufficiently upstream part of the
precursor of an evolving J-type shock is quasi-steady. The ion-flow timescale
is also relevant for the evolution of a shock moving into a region of
decreasing density. The models for shocks propagating into regions in which the
density increases and then decreases to its initial value cannot be entirely
described in terms of the results obtained for monotonically increasing and
decreasing densities. For the latter model, the long-term evolution to a C-type
shock cannot be approximated by quasi-steady models.

generalizes, on theoretical grounds, the recent results obtained with single

investigate the nature of mass loss. We used the AKARI Infrared Astronomy
Satellite and the Spitzer Space Telescope to obtain the surface brightness maps
of an evolved star R Cas at far-infrared wavelengths, since the temperature of
dust decreases as the distance from the star increases and one needs to probe
dust at lower temperatures, i.e., at longer wavelengths. The observed shell
structure and the star's known proper motion suggest that the structure
represents the interface regions between the dusty wind and the interstellar
medium. The deconvolved structures are fitted with the analytic bow shock
structure to determine the inclination angle of the bow shock cone. Our data
show that (1) the bow shock cone of 1 - 5 x 10^-5 solar masses (dust mass) is
inclined at 68 degrees with respect to the plane of the sky, and (2) the dust
temperature in the bow shock cone is raised to more than 20 K by collisional
shock interaction in addition to the ambient interstellar radiation field. By
comparison between the apex vector of the bow shock and space motion vector of
the star we infer that there is a flow of interstellar medium local to R Cas
whose flow velocity is at least 55.6 km/s, consistent with an environment
conducive to dust heating by shock interactions.

LAT-detected blazars have on average higher Doppler factors than
non-LAT-detected blazars, as has been implied indirectly in several earlier

distributions between gamma-ray bright and weak sources. Most interestingly,
gamma-ray bright blazars have a distribution of comoving frame viewing angles
that is significantly narrower than that of gamma-ray weak blazars and centred
roughly perpendicular to the jet axis. The lack of gamma-ray bright blazars at
large comoving frame viewing angles can be explained by relativistic beaming of
gamma-rays, while the apparent lack of gamma-ray bright blazars at small

intrinsic anisotropy or Lorentz factor dependence of the gamma-ray emission.

done for various choices of the prepotential, amongst others for the STU model.
These solutions permit to study the BPS attractor flow in AdS. We also
determine the most general supersymmetric static near-horizon geometry and
obtain the attractor equations in gauged supergravity. As a general feature we
find the presence of flat directions in the black hole potential, i.e.,
generically the values of the moduli on the horizon are not completely
specified by the charges. For one of the considered prepotentials, the
resulting moduli space is determined explicitely. Still, in all cases, we find
that the black hole entropy depends only on the charges, in agreement with the

that in our simulations the flow rapidly evolves from an arbitrary initial

magnitude below those observed in Galactic star-forming regions. The nitrogen
abundance in the LMC (~10% solar) and the high UV flux, which can
photo-dissociate the particularly fragile NH3 molecule, must both contribute to
the low fractional NH3 abundance, and we likely only see the molecule in an

constrain the masses of galaxy clusters, and is the most promising
observational technique for providing the mass calibration necessary for
precision cosmology with clusters. There are several challenges in estimating
cluster masses, particularly (a) the sensitivity to astrophysical effects and
observational systematics that modify the signal relative to the theoretical
expectations, and (b) biases that can arise due to assumptions in the mass
estimation method, such as the assumed radial profile of the cluster. All of
these challenges are more problematic in the inner regions of the cluster,
suggesting that their influence would ideally be suppressed for the purpose of
mass estimation. However, at any given radius the differential surface density
measured by lensing is sensitive to all mass within that radius, and the
corrupted signal from the inner parts is spread out to all scales. We develop a
new statistic that is ideal for estimation of cluster masses because it
completely eliminates mass contributions below a chosen scale (which we suggest
should be about 20 per cent of the virial radius), and thus reduces sensitivity
to systematic and astrophysical effects. We use simulated and analytical
profiles to quantify systematic biases on the estimated masses for several
standard methods of mass estimation, finding that these can lead to significant
mass biases that range from ten to over fifty per cent. The mass uncertainties
when using our new statistic are reduced by up to a factor of ten relative to
the standard methods, while only moderately increasing the statistical errors.

studying the physical origin and composition of our Universe. To date, most of
the direct studies have focused on shear-shear weak lensing correlations, but
it is also possible to extract the dark matter clustering by combining
galaxy-clustering and galaxy-galaxy-lensing measurements. In this study we
develop a method that can constrain the dark matter correlation function from
galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy-lensing measurements, by focusing on the
correlation coefficient between the galaxy and matter overdensity fields. To
generate a mock galaxy catalogue for testing purposes, we use the Halo
Occupation Distribution approach applied to a large ensemble of N-body
simulations to model pre-existing SDSS Luminous Red Galaxy sample observations.
Using this mock catalogue, we show that a direct comparison between the excess
surface mass density measured by lensing and its corresponding galaxy
clustering quantity is not optimal. We develop a new statistic that suppresses
the small-scale contributions to these observations and show that this new
statistic leads to a cross-correlation coefficient that is within a few percent
of unity down to 5 Mpc/h. Furthermore, the residual incoherence between the
galaxy and matter fields can be explained using a theoretical model for
scale-dependent bias, giving us a final estimator that is unbiased to within
1%. We also perform a comprehensive study of other physical effects that can
affect the analysis, such as redshift space distortions and differences in
radial windows between galaxy clustering and weak lensing observations. We
apply the method to a range of cosmological models and show the viability of
our new statistic to distinguish between cosmological models.

in terms of its dimension $d$ and the number of its facets $n$ is one of the
basic open questions in polytope theory \cite{BG}. Although some bounds are
known, the behaviour of the function $\Delta(d,n)$ is largely unknown. The
Hirsch conjecture, formulated in 1957 and reported in \cite{GD}, states that
$\Delta(d,n)$ is linear in $n$ and $d$: $\Delta(d,n) \leq n-d$. The conjecture
is known to hold in small dimensions, i.e., for $d \leq 3$ \cite{VK}, along
with other specific pairs of $d$ and $n$ (Table \ref{before}). However, the
asymptotic behaviour of $\Delta(d,n)$ is not well understood: the best upper
bound -- due to Kalai and Kleitman -- is quasi-polynomial \cite{GKDK}.

evidence for $\Delta(5,12)=\Delta(6,13)=7$. The first of these new values is of

future colliders is explored in a model-independent manner using the effective
Lagrangian approach through the $t \to u_i\tau \mu$ ($u_i=u,c$) decays. A
Yukawa sector that contemplates $SU_L(2)\times U_Y(1)$ invariants of up to
dimension six is proposed and used to derive the most general flavor violating
and CP violating $q_iq_jH$ and $l_il_jH$ vertices of renormalizable type.
Low-energy data, on high precision measurements, and experimental limits are
used to constraint the $tu_iH$ and $H\tau \mu$ vertices and then used to
predict the branching ratios for the $t \to u_i\tau \mu$ decays. It is found
that this branching ratios may be of the order of $ 10^{-4}-10^{-5}$, for a
relative light Higgs boson with mass lower than $2m_W$, which could be more
important than those typical values found in theories beyond the standard model
for the rare top quark decays $t\to u_iV_iV_j$ ($V_i=W,Z,\gamma, g$) or $t\to
u_il^+l^-$. %% LHC experiments, by using a total integrated luminosity of $\rm
3000 fb^{-1}$ of data, will be able to rule out, at 95% C.L., DFV top quark
decays up to a Higgs mass of 155 GeV/$c^2$ or discover such a process up to a
Higgs mass of 147 GeV/$c^2$.

cold, and contracting quasi-statically. The duration of the pre-collapse stage
is inversely proportional roughly to the square of the planetary mass, so
massive protoplanets have shorter pre-collapse timescales and therefore limited
opportunity for planetesimal capture. The available accretion time for
protoplanets with masses of 3, 5, 7, and 10 Jupiter masses is found to be
7.82E4, 2.62E4, 1.17E4 and 5.67E3 years, respectively. The total mass that can

dielectric measurements on the ferroelectric lead zirconate titanate (PZT)

that unipolar fatigue is evident though still less severe than bipolar fatigue
conducted at the same voltage. That has been attributed to polarization
retention (backswitching) induced by the residual depolarization field between
the monopolar pulses where the applied field is lower than the depolarization
field, and explained using the LPD-SICI model (LPD-SICI stands for local phase
decomposition caused by switching-induced charge injection). The conventional
view that switching does not occur during unipolar electrical cycling may need
to be corrected. PUND results recorded using the pulses of the same voltage as
those for repetitive fatigue cycling are not reliable if the voltage is lower
than 2Vc (Vc is the saturated coercive voltage). Dielectric measurements or
hysteresis-loop measurements at higher voltages (e.g. 4Vc) are more reliable
ways to evaluate the degree of fatigue and could provide more valuable
information in such situations. Finally, dielectric results have been used to
estimate the effective thickness di of the fatigue-induced degraded
(pyrochlorelike) interfacial layer after bipolar/unipolar fatigue, which has
not been done so far to our best knowledge. The fact that di is still much less

suggests that polarization fatigue in ferroelectrics is an interface effect,

simultaneously satisfy two contradictory extremum principles in the entropy
production, depending on the flow conditions. For a constant total flow rate,
the flow can satisfy (i) a pipe network minimum entropy production (MinEP)
principle with respect to the flow rates, and (ii) the maximum entropy
production (MaxEP) principle of Ziegler and Paltridge with respect to the
choice of flow regime. The first principle - different to but allied to that of
Prigogine - arises from the stability of the steady state compared to
non-steady-state flows; it is proven for isothermal laminar and turbulent flows
in parallel pipes with a constant power law exponent, but is otherwise invalid.
The second principle appears to be more fundamental, driving the formation of
turbulent flow in single and parallel pipes at higher Reynolds numbers. For
constant head conditions, the flow can satisfy (i) a modified maximum entropy
production (MaxEPMod) principle of \v{Z}upanovi\'c and co-workers with respect

matter to hadronic matter, and their corresponding correlation signatures are
discussed. Four criteria are highlighted for a definitive experimental search
for a QCD critical point. An old-new experimental measure, the optical opacity
(or its inverse the nuclear attenuation length) is determined, in terms of a
combination of nuclear suppression factors and a measurement of the relevant
fireball length scales. Length scale estimates using either the Hanbury Brown
-- Twiss radii or that of the initial nuclear geometry for measurements of
optical opacity with respect to the reaction plane yield, somewhat
surprizingly, nearly the same nuclear attenuation lenght in 0-5 % most central
200 GeV Au+Au collisions, corresponding to 2.9 $\pm$ 0.3 fm. The necessity and
the possibility of measuring critical exponents is also discussed in the
context of determination of the universality class of the QCD critical point.
Critical opalescence is proposed to locate such a critical point on the QCD
phase diagram, corresponding to a maximum of optical opacity in heavy ion
experiments.

sublinear time query is possible using O(n^{3+epsilon}) space. Our approach
also extends to the case where query points should lie on a given set of line

possible distant (709"") companion of the stellar quadruple Mizar ($\zeta$ UMa).
Comparing the revised Hipparcos proper motion for Alcor with the mean motion

km/s, which is comparable to the predicted velocity amplitude induced by the
newly-discovered companion ($\sim$1 km/s). Using a precise dynamical parallax

18 kAU), and their velocity vectors are marginally consistent ($\chi^2$

that the Mizar quadruple and the Alcor binary be together considered the 2nd
closest stellar sextuplet. The addition of Mizar-Alcor to the census of stellar
multiples with six or more components effectively doubles the local density of

meaning that any simplexwise linear embedding of the triangulation into

generalization of the concept of convexity. In even dimensions,
super-neighborliness is known to be a purely combinatorial condition which
implies the tightness of a triangulation.
  Here we present other sufficient and purely combinatorial conditions which
can be applied to the odd-dimensional case as well. One of the conditions is
that all vertex links are stacked spheres, which implies that the triangulation
is in Walkup's class $\mathcal{K}(d)$. We show that in any dimension $d\geq 4$
\emph{tight-neighborly} triangulations as defined by Lutz, Sulanke and Swartz

pronounced in antero-posterior (AP) and lateral direction, forming a torque of

a parameter space for peaks in the likelihood function which indicate the
presence of a signal. Random searches have proven to be very efficient as well
as easy to implement, compared e.g. to searches along regular grids in
parameter space. Knowledge of the parameterised shape of the signal searched
for adds structure to the parameter space, i.e., there are usually regions
requiring to be densely searched while in other regions a coarser search is
sufficient. On the other hand, prior information identifies the regions in
which a search will actually be promising or may likely be in vain. Defining
specific figures of merit allows one to combine both template metric and prior
distribution and devise optimal sampling schemes over the parameter space. We
show an example related to the gravitational wave signal from a binary inspiral
event. Here the template metric and prior information are particularly
contradictory, since signals from low-mass systems tolerate the least mismatch
in parameter space while high-mass systems are far more likely, as they imply a
greater signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and hence are detectable to greater
distances. The derived sampling strategy is implemented in a Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) algorithm where it improves convergence.

real-time and noninvasive measurements on biological matter. Unfortunately,
strong absorption in aqueous solutions and low spatial resolution return
difficult free-space investigations. A new approach based on integrated THz
circuits was used. The authors designed and fabricated a BioMEMS (Biological
MicroElectro-Mechanical System) compatible with microfluidic circulation and
electromagnetic propagation. It is dedicated to the ex vivo detection of nitric
oxide synthase (NOS) activity, which is involved in neurodegenerative
phenomena.
  Material/Methods: The biological model was a leech's central nervous system.
After its injury, the production of NO was observed and measured in the far-THz
spectral domain. The nerve cord was put inside a BioMEMS realized in
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) sealed on a glass wafer. Glass is a good material
for supporting high-frequency integrated waveguides such as coplanar waveguides
(CPWs). Measurements were performed with vectorial network analyser (VNA).
  Results: The transmission parameter in the frequency range of 0.14-0.22 THz
was measured through CPWs located just below the microchannel containing the
injured leech nerve cord. The lesion caused a decreased transmission
coefficient due to the NOS activity. L-NAME was injected inside the
microchannel and it was verified that it inhibits this activity.
  Conclusions: It was demonstrated that THz spectroscopy can detect a
biochemical event, such as NOS activity around an injured leech's nerve cord,
in real time. Future studies will be dedicated to quantitative measurements of
the reaction products using the sophisticated management of several drugs
allowed with microfluidic microsystems.

Most of what we know about the formation and evolution of the Bulge comes from
bright giant stars. The underlying assumption that giants represent all the
stars, and accurately trace the chemical evolution of a stellar population, is
under debate. In particular, recent observations of a few microlensed dwarf
stars give a very different picture of the evolution of the Bulge from that
given by the giant stars. [ABRIDGED] We perform a detailed elemental abundance
analysis of dwarf stars in the Galactic bulge, based on high-resolution spectra
that were obtained while the stars were optically magnified during
gravitational microlensing events. [ABRIDGED] We present detailed elemental
abundances and stellar ages for six new dwarf stars in the Galactic bulge.
Combining these with previous events, here re-analysed with the same methods,
we study a homogeneous sample of 15 stars, which constitute the largest sample
to date of microlensed dwarf stars in the Galactic bulge. We find that the
stars span the full range of metallicities from [Fe/H]=-0.72 to +0.54, and an
average metallicity of <[Fe/H]>=-0.08+/-0.47, close to the average metallicity
based on giant stars in the Bulge. Furthermore, the stars follow well-defined
abundance trends, that for [Fe/H]<0 are very similar to those of the local
Galactic thick disc. This suggests that the Bulge and the thick disc have had,
at least partially, comparable chemical histories. At sub-solar metallicities
we find the Bulge dwarf stars to have consistently old ages, while at
super-solar metallicities we find a wide range of ages. Using the new age and
abundance results from the microlensed dwarf stars we investigate possible
formation scenarios for the Bulge.

correlators with finite momentum (k) in a $AdS^4$ black hole background. At low
temperature, a substantial non-zero conductivity is only possible for a
frequency range $\omega>\omega_g=k$. This tallies with the simple fact that at
least an amount of energy $\omega_g$ is needed to create an excitation of
momentum $k$. Due to the existence of this ``gap'',one may expect that at zero
frequency limit the real part of momentum dependent conductivity falls
exponentially with $\frac{1}{T}$. Using analytic methods, we found a
$\exp(-\frac{\omega_c}{T})$ falloff of the real part of conductivity with
inverse temperature. Interestingly, $\omega_g \neq \omega_c$. From the above
results we speculate that the ``degrees of freedoms'', say carriers, different
than quasi particle excitation determines conductivity at low temperature and
low frequency limit. Here $\omega_c < \omega_g$ and we may calculate their
ratios analytically. We also discuss similar issues at a finite chemical
potential. Situation is rather different for an extremal blackhole. A zero
temperature extremal blackhole does not show a sharp gap for the finite
momentum excitations and the real part of conductivity is always non-zero for
any non-zero frequency $\omega$. However the real part of conductivity goes to
zero at $\omega\to0$ limit. Not surprisingly, we find a powerlaw decay with
temperature for the same quantity, as the extremal limit is approached.

measurements, these planet/star flux ratios indicate a poor heat distribution
to the night side of the planet and are in better agreement with an atmosphere
free of temperature inversion layer. Still, the presence of such an inversion
is not definitely ruled out by the observations and a larger wavelength
coverage is required to remove the current ambiguity. Our global analysis of
CoRoT, Spitzer and ground-based data confirms the large mass and size of the
planet with slightly revised values (Mp = 3.47 +- 0.22 Mjup, Rp = 1.466 +-
0.044 Rjup). We find a small but significant offset in the timing of the
occultation when compared to a purely circular orbital solution, leading to e
cos(omega) = -0.00291 +- 0.00063 where e is the orbital eccentricity and omega
is the argument of periastron. Constraining the age of the system to be at most
of a few hundreds of Myr and assuming that the non-zero orbital eccentricity is
not due to a third undetected body, we model the coupled orbital-tidal
evolution of the system with various tidal Q values, core sizes and initial
orbital parameters. For log(Q_s') = 5 - 6, our modelling is able to explain the
large radius of CoRoT-2b if log(Q_p') <= 5.5 through a transient tidal
circularization and corresponding planet tidal heating event. Under this model,
the planet will reach its Roche limit within 20 Myr at most.

Gorenstein if the canonical line bundle is holomorphically trivial in some
punctured neighborhood of the singular point and is called numerically
Gorenstein if this line bundle is topologically trivial. The second notion
depends only on the topological type of the singularity. Laufer proved in 1977
that, given a numerically Gorenstein topological type of singularity, every
analytical realization of it is Gorenstein if and only if one has either a
Kleinian or a minimally elliptic topological type. The question to know if any
numerically Gorenstein topology was realizable by some Gorenstein singularity
was left open. We prove that this is indeed the case. Our method is to plumb
holomorphically meromorphic 2-forms obtained by adequate pull-backs of the
natural holomorphic symplectic forms on the total spaces of the canonical line
bundles of complex curves. More generally, we show that any normal surface
singularity is homeomorphic to a Q-Gorenstein singularity whose index is equal
to the smallest common denominator of the coefficients of the canonical cycle
of the starting singularity.

formation of cool plasma prominence embedded in the hot corona. Recent
observations from the high resolution Hinode/SOT telescope allow us to compute
velocities perpendicularly to the line-of-sight or transverse velocities.
Combining simultaneous observations obtained in H-alpha with Hinode/SOT and the
MSDP spectrograph operating in the Meudon solar tower we derive the velocity
vectors of a quiescent prominence. The velocities perpendicular to the
line-of-sight are measured by time slice technique, the Dopplershifts by the
bisector method. The Dopplershifts of bright threads derived from the MSDP
reach 15 km/s at the edges of the prominence and are between +/- 5 km/s in the
center of the prominence. Even though they are minimum values due to seeing
effect, they are of the same order as the transverse velocities. These
measurements are very important because they suggest that the
verticalstructures shown in SOT may not be real vertical magnetic structures in
the sky plane. The vertical structures could be a pile up of dips in more or
less horizontal magnetic field lines in a 3D perspective, as it was proposed by
many MHD modelers. In our analysis we also calibrate the Hinode H-alpha data
using MSDP observations obtained simultaneously.

  controlled fusion",,,,"physics.plasm-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The localized deposition of the energy of a laser pulse, as it ablates a
solid target, introduces high thermal pressure gradients in the plasma. The
thermal expansion of this laser-heated plasma into the ambient medium (ionized
residual gas) triggers the formation of non-linear structures in the
collision-less plasma. Here an electron-proton plasma is modelled with a
particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation to reproduce aspects of this plasma
expansion. A jump is introduced in the thermal pressure of the plasma, across
which the otherwise spatially uniform temperature and density change by the
factor 100. The electrons from the hot plasma expand into the cool one and the
charge imbalance drags a beam of cool electrons into the hot plasma. This
double layer reduces the electron temperature gradient. The presence of the
low-pressure plasma modifies the proton dynamics compared to the plasma
expansion into a vacuum. The jump in the thermal pressure develops into a
primary shock. The fast protons, which move from the hot into the cold plasma
in form of a beam, give rise to the formation of phase space holes in the
electron and proton distributions. The proton phase space holes develop into a
secondary shock that thermalizes the beam.

used to characterize in detail the energy distribution of neutron reference
fields at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) and their
contamination with charged particles. The monoenergetic reference fields at PTB
in the neutron energy range from 1.5 MeV up to 19 MeV are generated by proton
and deuteron beams impinging on solid and gas targets of tritium and deuterium.
The energy of the incoming particles and the variation of the angle under which
the measurement is performed produce monoenergetic reference fields with
different mean energies and line shapes.
  In this paper we present high resolution neutron spectrometry measurements of
different monoenergetic reference fields. The results are compared with
calculated spectra taking into account the actual target parameters. Line
structures in the order of 80 keV for a neutron energy of 9 MeV were resolved.
The shift of the mean energy and the increasing of the width of the neutron
peak with increasing pressure in the gas target in the order of 30 keV were
measured.
  Another result is the determination of the contamination of the neutron field
at 14 MeV with high energy charged particles (protons) from side reactions
inside the T-target.
  The experiments have shown that this detector is an easy to operate compact
neutron spectrometer with extremely good energy resolution and that detailed
structures in the line shapes of monoenergetic neutron fields can be resolved
without using time of flight techniques.

make it likely, showing that they are not fulfilled. Likewise, we argue that,
as now well accepted, DM would need somewhat contrived properties to contribute
significantly to the observed positron signal, even when including e.g.
clumpiness effects. This means that most of natural DM candidates arising in
particle physics beyond the standard model are not expected to be observed in
the cosmic antimatter spectrum, unfortunately. However, this does not prevent
them from remaining excellent DM candidates, this only points towards the
crucial need of developing much more complex detection strategies
(multimessenger, multiwavelength, multiscale searches).

research. Here we formalize adaptive agents as mixture distributions over
sequences of inputs and outputs (I/O). Each distribution of the mixture
constitutes a `possible world', but the agent does not know which of the
possible worlds it is actually facing. The problem is to adapt the I/O stream
in a way that is compatible with the true world. A natural measure of
adaptation can be obtained by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the
I/O distribution of the true world and the I/O distribution expected by the
agent that is uncertain about possible worlds. In the case of pure input
streams, the Bayesian mixture provides a well-known solution for this problem.
We show, however, that in the case of I/O streams this solution breaks down,
because outputs are issued by the agent itself and require a different
probabilistic syntax as provided by intervention calculus. Based on this
calculus, we obtain a Bayesian control rule that allows modeling adaptive
behavior with mixture distributions over I/O streams. This rule might allow for
a novel approach to adaptive control based on a minimum KL-principle.

results to analyze agent-environment interactions. We show that the expected
utility that will actually be achieved by the agent is given by the negative
cross-entropy from the input-output (I/O) distribution of the coupled
