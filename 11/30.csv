mysterious spectral component increasing with frequency and hence distinct from
the microwave component commonly accepted to be produced by gyrosynchrotron
(GS) emission from accelerated electrons. Evidently, having a distinct sub-THz
component requires either a distinct emission mechanism (compared to the GS
one), or different properties of electrons and location, or both. We find,
however, that the list of possible emission mechanisms is incomplete. This
Letter proposes a more complete list of emission mechanisms, capable of
producing a sub-THz component, both well-known and new in this context and
calculates a representative set of their spectra produced by a) free-free
emission, b) gyrosynchrotron emission, c) synchrotron emission from
relativistic positrons/electrons, d) diffusive radiation, and e) Cherenkov
emission. We discuss the possible role of the mechanisms in forming the sub-THz
emission and emphasize their diagnostics potential for flares.

the variables which maximizes the total weight of satisfied equations. This
problem generalizes Max Cut. The expected weight of satisfied equations is
$W/2$, where $W=w_1+... +w_m$; $W/2$ is a tight lower bound on the optimal
solution of Max Lin-2.
  Mahajan et al. (J. Comput. Syst. Sci. 75, 2009) stated the following
parameterized version of Max Lin-2: decide whether there is an assignment of
values to the variables that satisfies equations of total weight at least
$W/2+k$, where $k$ is the parameter. They asked whether this parameterized
problem is fixed-parameter tractable, i.e., can be solved in time
$f(k)(nm)^{O(1)}$, where $f(k)$ is an arbitrary computable function in $k$
only. Their question remains open, but using some probabilistic inequalities
and, in one case, a Fourier analysis inequality, Gutin et al. (IWPEC 2009)
proved that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable in three special cases.
  In this paper we significantly extend two of the three special cases using
only tools from combinatorics. We show that one of our results can be used to
obtain a combinatorial proof that another problem from Mahajan et al. (J.

tractable for each $r\ge 2.$ Note that Max $r$-SAT above the Average has been

Mechanics as a ""fair operational framework"", namely regarding the theory as a

of suitable tests, having local control and low experimental complexity. In
addition to causality, the following postulates have been considered: PFAITH
(existence of a pure preparationally faithful state), and FAITHE (existence of
a faithful effect). These postulates have exhibited an unexpected theoretical
power, excluding all known nonquantum probabilistic theories. Later in Ref. [2]
in addition to causality and PFAITH, postulate LDISCR (local discriminability)
and PURIFY (purifiability of all states) have been considered, narrowing the
probabilistic theory to something very close to Quantum Mechanics. In the
present paper we test the above postulates on some nonquantum probabilistic
models. The first model, ""the two-box world"" is an extension of the
Popescu-Rohrlich model, which achieves the greatest violation of the CHSH
inequality compatible with the no-signaling principle. The second model ""the
two-clock world"" is actually a full class of models, all having a disk as
convex set of states for the local system. One of them corresponds to the ""the
two-rebit world"", namely qubits with real Hilbert space. The third model--""the
spin-factor""--is a sort of n-dimensional generalization of the clock. Finally
the last model is ""the classical probabilistic theory"". We see how each model
violates some of the proposed postulates, when and how teleportation can be
achieved, and we analyze other interesting connections between these postulate
violations, along with deep relations between the local and the non-local

excellent agreement with NRG results for the linear conductance at finite gate

multiplexing gain of $K$-user interference channels, the analyses performed so
far have predominantly focused on the case when global channel knowledge is
available at each node of the network. This paper considers the problem where
each receiver knows its channels from all the transmitters and feeds back this
information using a limited number of bits to all other terminals. In
particular, channel quantization over the composite Grassmann manifold is
proposed and analyzed. It is shown, for $K$-user multiple-input,
multiple-output (MIMO) interference channels, that when the transmitters use an
interference alignment strategy as if the quantized channel estimates obtained
via this limited feedback are perfect, the full sum degrees of freedom of the
interference channel can be achieved as long as the feedback bit rate scales
sufficiently fast with the signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, this is only one
extreme point of a continuous tradeoff between achievable degrees of freedom
region and user feedback rate scalings which are allowed to be non-identical.
It is seen that a slower scaling of feedback rate for any one user leads to
commensurately fewer degrees of freedom for that user alone.

peculiar velocity field are sensitive probes of the matter density fluctuations
on very large scales. In practice, however, peculiar velocity surveys are
usually sparse and noisy, which can lead to the aliasing of small scale power
into what is meant to be a probe of the largest scales. Previously, we
developed an optimal ``minimum variance'' (MV) weighting scheme, designed to
overcome this problem by minimizing the difference between the measured bulk
flow (BF) and that which would be measured by an ideal survey. Here we extend
this MV analysis to include the shear and octupole moments, which are designed
to have almost no correlations between them so that they are virtually
orthogonal. We apply this MV analysis to a compilation of all major peculiar
velocity surveys, consisting of 4536 measurements. Our estimate of the BF on
scales of ~ 100 Mpc/h has a magnitude of |v|= 416 +/- 78 km/s towards Galactic
l = 282 degree +/- 11 degree and b = 6 degree +/- 6 degree. This result is in
disagreement with LCDM with WMAP5 cosmological parameters at a high confidence
level, but is in good agreement with our previous MV result without an
orthogonality constraint, showing that the shear and octupole moments did not
contaminate the previous BF measurement. The shear and octupole moments are
consistent with WMAP5 power spectrum, although the measurement noise is larger
for these moments than for the BF. The relatively low shear moments suggest
that the sources responsible for the BF are at large distances.

whole-cell behavior of a large metabolic network be controlled by constraining
the flux of one or more reactions in the network? This touches upon the issue
of the number of degrees of freedom contained by one such network. Using the
metabolic network of Escherichia coli as a model system, here we address this
question theoretically by exploring not only reaction deletions, but also a
continuum of all possible reaction expression levels. We show that the behavior
of the metabolic network can be largely manipulated by the pinned expression of
a single reaction. In particular, a relevant fraction of the metabolic
reactions exhibits canalizing interactions, in that the specification of one
reaction flux determines cellular growth as well as the fluxes of most other
reactions in optimal steady states. The activity of individual reactions can
thus be used as surrogates to monitor and possibly control cellular growth and
other whole-cell behaviors. In addition to its implications for the study of
control processes, our methodology provides a new approach to study how the
integrated dynamics of the entire metabolic network emerges from the

main ingredients of stochastic stability of the synchronous regime. In
particular, it quantifies the contribution of the network topology. The
estimate of coherence for the randomly perturbed network can be used as means
for analytic inference of degree of stability of the synchronous solution of
the unperturbed deterministic network. Furthermore, we show that in large
networks, the effects of noise on the dynamics of each oscillator can be
effectively controlled by varying the strength of coupling, which provides a
powerful mechanism of denoising. This suggests that the organization of
oscillators in a coupled network may play an important role in maintaining
robust oscillations in random environment. The analysis is complemented with

Additionally, recomputation of phase function parameters using data in which

degree of linear polarization. Consistent with previous findings claiming
larger Doppler factors for brighter gamma-ray blazars, quasars listed in our

sequences of sparse signals (with unknown and time-varying sparsity patterns)
from a limited number of noisy linear measurements. The sparsity pattern is
assumed to change slowly with time. The idea of our proposed solution,
LS-CS-residual (LS-CS), is to replace compressed sensing (CS) on the
observation by CS on the least squares (LS) residual computed using the
previous estimate of the support. We bound CS-residual error and show that when
the number of available measurements is small, the bound is much smaller than
that on CS error if the sparsity pattern changes slowly enough. We also obtain
conditions for ""stability"" of LS-CS over time for a signal model that allows
support additions and removals, and that allows coefficients to gradually
increase (decrease) until they reach a constant value (become zero). By
""stability"", we mean that the number of misses and extras in the support
estimate remain bounded by time-invariant values (in turn implying a
time-invariant bound on LS-CS error). The concept is meaningful only if the
bounds are small compared to the support size. Numerical experiments backing
our claims are shown.

  version of the paper.",,,,"cs.CC cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We initiate a study of when the value of mathematical relaxations such as
linear and semidefinite programs for constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) is
approximately preserved when restricting the instance to a sub-instance induced
by a small random subsample of the variables. Let $C$ be a family of CSPs such
as 3SAT, Max-Cut, etc., and let $\Pi$ be a relaxation for $C$, in the sense
that for every instance $P\in C$, $\Pi(P)$ is an upper bound the maximum
fraction of satisfiable constraints of $P$. Loosely speaking, we say that
subsampling holds for $C$ and $\Pi$ if for every sufficiently dense instance $P
\in C$ and every $\epsilon>0$, if we let $P'$ be the instance obtained by
restricting $P$ to a sufficiently large constant number of variables, then
$\Pi(P') \in (1\pm \epsilon)\Pi(P)$. We say that weak subsampling holds if the
above guarantee is replaced with $\Pi(P')=1-\Theta(\gamma)$ whenever
$\Pi(P)=1-\gamma$. We show: 1. Subsampling holds for the BasicLP and BasicSDP
programs. BasicSDP is a variant of the relaxation considered by Raghavendra
(2008), who showed it gives an optimal approximation factor for every CSP under
the unique games conjecture. BasicLP is the linear programming analog of
BasicSDP. 2. For tighter versions of BasicSDP obtained by adding additional
constraints from the Lasserre hierarchy, weak subsampling holds for CSPs of
unique games type. 3. There are non-unique CSPs for which even weak subsampling
fails for the above tighter semidefinite programs. Also there are unique CSPs
for which subsampling fails for the Sherali-Adams linear programming hierarchy.
As a corollary of our weak subsampling for strong semidefinite programs, we
obtain a polynomial-time algorithm to certify that random geometric graphs (of
the type considered by Feige and Schechtman, 2002) of max-cut value $1-\gamma$
have a cut value at most $1-\gamma/10$.

with a fixed number $u$ of frequency sub-bands to be shared among $N$
transmitter-receiver pairs. It is assumed that the number of active users is a
random variable with a given probability mass function. Moreover, users are
unaware of each other's codebooks and hence, no multiuser detection is
possible. We propose a randomized Frequency Hopping (FH) scheme in which each
transmitter randomly hops over a subset of $u$ sub-bands from transmission to
transmission. We derive lower and upper bounds on the mutual information of
each user and demonstrate that, for large Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) values,
the two bounds coincide. This observation enables us to compute the sum
multiplexing gain of the system and obtain the optimum hopping strategy for
maximizing this quantity. We compare the performance of the FH system with that
of the Frequency Division (FD) system in terms of several performance measures
and show that (depending on the probability mass function of the number of
active users) the FH system can offer a significant improvement implying a more
efficient usage of the spectrum.

neutrino emission can be a candidate of gamma-ray burst (GRB) central engines.
The strong field $\geq10^{15}-10^{16}$ G of the magnetar can play a significant
role in affecting the disk properties and even lead to the funnel accretion
process. We investigate the effects of strong fields on the disks around
magnetars, and discuss implications of such accreting magnetar systems for GRB
and GRB-like events. We discuss quantum effects of the strong fields on the
disk, and use the MHD conservation equations to describe the behavior of the
disk flow coupled with a large scale field, which is generated by the star-disk
interaction. In general, stronger fields give higher disk densities, pressures,
temperatures and neutrino luminosity, and change the electron fraction and
degeneracy state significantly. A magnetized disk is always viscously stable
outside the Alfv\'{e}n radius, but will be thermally unstable near the
Alfv\'{e}n radius where the magnetic field plays a more important role in
transferring the angular momentum and heating the disk than the viscous stress.
The funnel accretion process will be only important for an extremely strong
field, which creates a magnetosphere inside the Alfv\'{e}n radius and truncates
the plane disk. Because of higher temperature and more concentrated neutrino
emission of the magnetar surface ring-like belt region covered by funnel
accretion, the neutrino annihilation rate from the accreting magnetars can be
much higher than that from accreting neutron stars without fields. Furthermore,
the neutrino annihilation mechanism and the magnetically-driven pulsar wind
from the magnetar surface can work together to generate and feed an
ultra-relativistic jet along the stellar magnetic poles.

Space Telescope triggered on two short, and relatively dim bursts with spectral
properties similar to Soft Gamma Repeater (SGR) bursts. Independent
localizations of the bursts by triangulation with the Konus-RF and with the
Swift satellite, confirmed their origin from the same, previously unknown,
source. The subsequent discovery of X-ray pulsations with the Rossi X-ray
Timing Explorer (RXTE), confirmed the magnetar nature of the new source, SGR
J0418+5729. We describe here the Fermi/GBM observations, the discovery and the
localization of this new SGR, and our infrared and Chandra X-ray observations.
We also present a detailed temporal and spectral study of the two GBM bursts.
SGR J0418+5729 is the second source discovered in the same region of the sky in
the last year, the other one being SGR J0501+4516. Both sources lie in the
direction of the galactic anti-center and presumably at the nearby distance of
~2 kpc (assuming they reside in the Perseus arm of our galaxy). The
near-threshold GBM detection of bursts from SGR J0418+5729 suggests that there
may be more such dim SGRs throughout our galaxy, possibly exceeding the
population of bright SGRs. Finally, using sample statistics, we conclude that
the implications of the new SGR discovery on the number of observable active

over surfaces. The aim of this paper is to present a noncommutative
generalisation of rational singularities, which we call numerical rationality,

choice of resolution. Our main result is that the log terminal orders arising
from the noncommutative minimal model program, in particular, canonical orders

consider a randomized Frequency Hopping (FH) scheme in which each transmitter
randomly hops over a subset of the $u$ sub-bands from transmission to

algorithms from the computation of anticipatory systems. The self-organizing

encounter which provides the variation. Organization and self-organization of
communication are reflexive upon and therefore reconstructive of each other.

the characteristics of La emission from the cold gas streams that fed galaxies
in massive haloes at high redshift. The La luminosity in our simulations is
powered by the release of gravitational energy as gas flows from the
intergalactic medium into the halo potential wells. The UV background
contributes only <20% to the gas heating. The La emissivity is due primarily to
electron-impact excitation cooling radiation in gas ~2x10^4K. We calculate the
La emissivities assuming collisional ionisation equilibrium (CIE) at all gas
temperatures. The simulated streams are self-shielded against the UV
background, so photoionisation and recombination contribute negligibly to the
La line formation. We produce theoretical maps of the La surface brightnesses,
assuming that ~85% of the La photons are directly observable. We find that
typical haloes of mass Mv~10^12-13 Msun at z~3 emit as La blobs (LABs) with
luminosities 10^43-44 erg/s. Most of the La comes from the extended narrow,
partly clumpy, inflowing, cold streams that feed the growing galaxies. The
predicted LAB morphology is therefore irregular, with dense clumps and
elongated extensions. The linewidth is expected to range from 10^2 to more than
10^3 km/s with a large variance. The typical La surface brightness profile is
proportional to r^-1.2 where r is the distance from the halo centre. Our
simulated LABs are similar in luminosity, morphology and extent to the observed
LABs, with distinct kinematic features. The predicted La luminosity function is
consistent with observations, and the predicted areas and linewidths roughly
recover the observed scaling relations. This mechanism for producing LABs
appears inevitable in many high-z galaxies. Some of the LABs may thus be
regarded as direct detections of the cold streams that drove galaxy evolution
at high z.

differently, a combination of optical, infrared, submm, and radio techniques is
needed to derive a complete picture of planetary nebulae. The effects of
projection can also make the derivation of the true 3-D structure difficult.
Using a number of examples, we show that bipolar and multipolar nebulae are
much more common than usually inferred from morphological classifications of
apparent structures of planetary nebulae.
  We put forward a new hypothesis that the bipolar and multipolar lobes of PN
are not regions of high-density ejected matter, but the result of ionization
and illumination. The visible bright regions are in fact volume of low
densities (cleared by high-velocity outflows) where the UV photons are being
channelled through. We suggest that multipolar nebulae with similar lobe sizes
are not caused by simultaneous ejection of matter in several directions, but by
leakage of UV photons into those directions.

higher than A=100, 50, and 10, respectively, where s represents the projected

detected through the high-magnification channel in lensing surveys that focus
on high-magnification events for efficient detections of microlensing planets.

are products of the single pi^0 decay. This is a possible reason for the
deterioration of the experiment's sensitivity below 100 GeV. In this paper a
system of two MAGIC telescopes working in stereoscopic mode is studied using
Monte Carlo simulations. The detected images have similar shapes to that of
primary gamma-rays and they have small sizes (mainly below 400 photoelectrons
(p.e.)) which correspond to an energy of primary gamma-rays below 100 GeV. The
background from single or two electromagnetic subcascdes is concentrated at
energies below 200 GeV. Finally the number of background events is compared to
the number of VHE gamma-ray excess events from the Crab Nebula. The
investigated background survives simple cuts for sizes below 250 p.e. and thus
the experiment's sensitivity deteriorates at lower energies.

experiments are focused on high-magnification events searching for planetary
signals near the peak of lensing light curves. However, it is known that
central perturbations can also be produced by binary companions and thus it is
important to distinguish planetary signals from those induced by binary
companions. In this paper, we analyze the light curves of microlensing events

perturbations near the peaks of the light curves. From detailed modeling of the
light curves, we find that the perturbations of the events are caused by binary
companions rather than planets. From close examination of the light curves
combined with the underlying physical geometry of the lens system obtained from
modeling, we find that the short time-scale caustic-crossing feature occurring
at a low or a moderate base magnification with an additional secondary
perturbation is a typical feature of binary-lens events and thus can be used
for the discrimination between the binary and planetary interpretations.

find up to one order in magnitude difference in the decoherence rate for
realistically slow solvent environments even in the weak coupling regime, while
both results coincide for fast environmental noise. This shows explicitely the
nonperturbative influence of the bioenvironmental fluctuations and might render
current perturbative approaches to biomolecular exciton transport questionable.

galaxies with dark matter halos. The aim of these simulations is to study the
intergalactic stellar populations produced in both parabolic and hyperbolic
encounters. We model progenitor galaxies with total-to-luminous mass ratios
M_T/M_L 3 and 11. The initial mass of the colliding galaxies are chosen so that
M_1/M_2 and 10. The model galaxies are populated by particles representing
stars, as in Stanghellini et al. (2006), and dark matter. Merger remnants
resulting from these encounters display a population of unbounded particles,
both dark and luminous. The number of particles becoming unbounded depends on
orbital configuration, with hyperbolic encounters producing a larger luminous
intracluster population than parabolic encounters. Furthermore, in simulations
with identical orbital parameters, a lower M_T/M_L of the colliding galaxies
produces a larger fraction of unbounded luminous particles. For each modeled
collision, the fraction of unbounded to initial stellar mass is the same in all
mass-bins considered, similarly to what we found previously by modeling
encounters of galaxies without dark halos. The fraction of intergalactic to
total luminosity resulting from our simulations is ~ 4% and ~ 6% for
dark-to-bright mass rations of 10 and 2 respectively. These unbounded-to-total
luminous fractions are down from 17 % that we had previously found in the case
of no dark halos. Our results are in broad agreement with intergalactic light
observed in groups of galaxies, while the results of our previous models
without dark halos better encompass observed intracluster populations. We
suggest a possible formation scenario of intergalactic stars.

properties of the resulting sample: statistic of the identified objects, number
counts, redshift distribution and morphological types. We also made a crude
analysis of the clustering properties of the sources and constructed spectral
energy distributions (SEDs) of 47 selected objects with the best photometry.
Among 1000 investigated ADF-S sources, 545 were identified at other
wavelengths. From them, 518 are known galaxies, and 343 of them were not known
previously as infra-red sources. We found redshifts of 48 extragalactic objects
and morphological types of 77 galaxies. We conclude that the bright FIR point
sources observed in the ADF-S are mostly nearby galaxies.Their properties are
very similar to properties of the local population of optically bright
galaxies, except an unusually high ratio of peculiar or interacting objects and
a smaller percentage of elliptical galaxies. The percentage of lenticular
galaxies is the same as in the optically bright population which suggests they
may frequently contain a significant amount of cool dust. It is possible that
source confusion plays a significant role in more than 34% of measurements. The
SEDs display a variety of galaxy types, from very actively star forming to very
quiescent. Thanks to the AKARI long wavelength bands it was revealed for the
first time that these galaxies form a population of objects with very cool
dust.

disks with finite diffusion. For small magnetic Prandtl number the microscopic
viscosity completely drops out from the analysis so that the stability maps and
the growth rates expressed in terms of the magnetic Reynolds number Rm and the
Lundquist number S do not depend on the magnetic Prandtl number Pm. The minimum
magnetic field for onset of nonaxisymmetric MRI grows with Rm. For given S all
nonaxisymmetric modes disappear for sufficiently high Rm. This behavior is a
consequence of the radial fine-structure of the nonaxisymmetric modes resulting
from the winding effect of differential rotation. It is this fine-structure
which presents severe resolution problems for the numerical simulation of MRI
at large Rm. For weak supercritical magnetic fields only axisymmetric modes are
unstable. Nonaxisymmetric modes need stronger fields and not too fast rotation.
If Pm is small its real value does not play any role in MRI.

structure similar to that of CuWO4 and FeMoO4-II. The onset of each transition
is detected at 17.1 and 31 GPa. In ZnWO4 the onset of the monoclinic-triclinic
transition has been also found at 15.1 GPa. These findings are supported by
density-functional theory calculations, which predict the occurrence of
additional transitions upon further compression. Calculations have been also
performed for wolframite-type MnWO4, which is found to have an
antiferromagnetic configuration. In addition, x-ray absorption and diffraction
experiments as well as calculations reveal details of the local-atomic
compression in the studied compounds. In particular, below the transition
pressure the ZnO6 and equivalent polyhedra tend to become more regular, whereas
the WO6 octahedra remain almost unchanged. Fitting the pressure-volume data we
obtained the equation of state for the low-pressure phase of MgWO4 and ZnWO4.
These and previous results on MnWO4 and CdWO4 are compared with the
calculations, being the compressibility of wolframite-type tungstates

expectation value, and also of conventional photons assumed to participate both
in the hidden and Standard-Model sectors (after the electroweak symmetry is
spontaneously broken by the Standard-Model Higgs mechanism). This provides a
""photonic portal"" to the hidden sector as an alternative to the popular ""Higgs
portal"". Moreover, we have proposed to stop the proliferation of new kinds of
gauge bosons as sterile mediators of nongravitational interactions in the
hidden sector, introducing instead nongauge mediating bosons described by an
antisymmetric-tensor field (of dimension one), whose sources are given not only
by sterino-antisterino pairs, but also by steron-photon pairs. Then,
conventional photons display, beside the familiar gauge coupling to the
Standard-Model electric current, a new nongauge weak coupling of sterile
antisymmetric-tensor bosons to steron-photon pairs, where photons are described
by the gauge-invariant electromagnetic field F_{\mu \nu}. The new mediators are
unstable, decaying, for instance, into electron-positron pairs. When
interacting in pairs, they can annihilate simply into two photons. The
corresponding cross-section is calculated.

not linked to any specific structure for the Dirac neutrino Yukawa coupling

minimal flavour violation principle to the leptonic sector. Generalizing this
principle, we assume that the structure of the right handed neutrino mass
matrix is determined by $y_D$ and the charged lepton Yukawa coupling matrix
$y_l$ in an effective theory invariant under specific groups ${\cal G}_F$
contained in the full symmetry group of the kinetic energy terms. ${\cal G}_F$
invariance also leads to specific structure for the departure from degeneracy.
The neutrino mass matrix (with degenerate mass $m_0$) resulting after seesaw
mechanism has a simple form ${\cal M}_\nu\approx m_0(I-p y_ly_l^T)$ in one
particular scenario based on supersymmetry. This form is shown to lead to
correct description of neutrino masses and mixing angles. The thermal
leptogenesis after inclusion of flavour effects can account for the observed
baryon asymmetry of the universe within the present scenario. Rates for lepton
flavour violating processes can occur at observable levels in the
supersymmetric version of the scenario.

models consists of a disk and bipolar lobes that are surrounded by an AGB
shell, each component having different dust characteristics. The upper limit of
the grain size $a_\mathrm{max}$ in the lobes is estimated to be $0.5 \mu$m from
the polarization value in the bipolar lobe. The $a_\mathrm{max}$ value of the
disk is constrained with the disk mass (0.2 $M_{\sun}$), which was estimated
from a previous CO emission line observation. We find a good model with
$a_\mathrm{max}=1000.0 \mu$m, which provides an approximated disk mass of 0.15
$M_{\sun}$. Even taking into account uncertainties such as the gas-to-dust mass
ratio, a significantly larger dust of $a_\mathrm{max}>100.0 \mu$m, comparing to
the dust in the lobe, is expected.
  We also estimated the disk inner radius, the disk outer radius, and the
envelope mass to be 30 $R_\star$(=9 AU), 4500 AU, and 4 $M_{\sun}$,
respectively, where $v_\mathrm{exp}$ is the expansion velocity. If the dust
existing in the lobes in large separations from the central star undergoes
little dust processing, the dust sizes preserves the ones in the dust
formation. Submicron-sized grains are found in many objects besides M 1--92,
suggesting that the size does not depend much on the object properties, such as
initial mass of the central star and chemical composition of the stellar
system. On the other hand, the grain sizes in the disk do. Evidence of large
grains has been reported in many bipolar PPNs, including M 1--92. This result
suggests that disks play an important role in grain growth.

remaining ones therefore have a larger transverse emittance. This effect,
called core depletion, may cause a decrease in luminosity. An approximate
analytic model is developed to study the effect and benchmarked against a
multiparticle tracking simulation. Finally, the time evolution of the intensity

calculated, taking into account also other processes than collisions. The

Measurement error effects on parameter estimates were evaluated by using

proved a law of large numbers for dynamic random environments satisfying a

properties of the associated rate functions. Under an exponential space-time
mixing condition for the spin-flip system, which is stronger than cone-mixing,
the two rate functions have a unique zero, i.e., the slow-down phenomenon known
to be possible in a static random environment does not survive in a fast mixing
dynamic random environment. In contrast, we show that for the simple symmetric
exclusion dynamics, which is not cone-mixing (and which is not a spin-flip
system either), slow-down does occur.

hole entropy; on the contrary, a statistical interpretation follows from it.
This interpretation is based on the two concepts: nonadditivity of black hole
entropy and Landau quantization. Using nonadditivity a microcanonical
distribution for a black hole is found and it is shown that the statistical
weight of black hole should be proportional to its area. By analogy with
conventional Landau quantization, it is shown that quantization of black hole
is nothing but the Landau quantization. The Landau levels of black hole and
their degeneracy are found. The degree of degeneracy is equal to the number of
ways to distribute a patch of area $8\pi l_P^{2}$ over the horizon. Taking into
account these results, it is argued that the black hole entropy should be of
the form $S_{bh} =2\pi\cdot\Delta\Gamma $, where the number of microstates is
$\Delta\Gamma = A/8\pi l_P^{2}$. The nature of the degrees of freedom
responsible for black hole entropy is elucidated. The applications of the new
interpretation are presented. The effect of noncommuting coordinates is

static and plane-parallel stratification to a complex compound of intermittent
domains, which are dynamically coupled to the layers below and above. In this
picture, the chromosphere in a stricter sense is associated with the typical
fibrillar structure shaped by magnetic fields like it is known from images
taken in the H alpha line core. In internetwork regions below this layer, there
exists a domain with propagating shock waves and weak magnetic fields, which
both probably interact with the overlying large scale field. The existence of
such a sub-canopy domain certainly depends on the properties of the overlying
field. Details of the structure of the lower atmosphere can therefore be
expected to vary significantly from location to location. Here, high-resolution
observations, which were obtained with the CRISP filter at the Swedish Solar
Telescope, are used to derive qualitative constraints for the atmospheric
structure of quiet Sun regions.

non-trivial constraints on the partition vector. As an application, we derive a
shifted quantization law for the spatial momentum of (2, 0) theory on a

direct use of GRBs to probe cosmology [N. Liang, W. K. Xiao, Y. Liu, and S. N.
Zhang, Astrophys. J. 685, 354 (2008).]. In this paper, a simple method is
provided to combine GRB data into the joint observational data analysis to
constrain cosmological models; in this method those SNe Ia data points used for
calibrating the GRB data are not used to avoid any correlation between them. We
find that the $\Lambda$CDM model is consistent with the joint data in the
1-$\sigma$ confidence region, using the GRB data at high redshift calibrated
with the interpolating method, the Constitution set of SNe Ia, the cosmic
microwave background radiation from Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe five
year observation, the baryonic acoustic oscillation from the spectroscopic
Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 galaxy sample, the x-ray baryon mass
fraction in clusters of galaxies, and the observational Hubble parameter versus
redshift data. Comparing to the joint constraints with GRBs and without GRBs,
we find that the contribution of GRBs to the joint cosmological constraints is
a slight shift in the confidence regions of cosmological parameters to better
enclose the $\Lambda$CDM model. Finally, we reconstruct the acceleration
history of the Universe up to $z>6$ with the distance moduli of SNe Ia and GRBs
and find some features that deviate from the $\Lambda$CDM model and seem to
favor oscillatory cosmology models; however further investigations are needed
to better understand the situation.

density PDFs in the clouds. Results: The column density PDFs of most molecular
clouds are well-fitted by log-normal functions at low column densities (0.5 mag
< A_v < 3-5 mag). However, at higher column densities prominent, power-law-like
wings are common. In particular, we identify a trend among the PDFs: active
star-forming clouds always have prominent non-log-normal wings. In contrast,
clouds without active star formation resemble log-normals over the whole
observed column density range, or show only low excess of higher column
densities. This trend is also reflected in the cumulative PDFs, showing that
the fraction of high column density material is significantly larger in
star-forming clouds. These observations are in agreement with an evolutionary
trend where turbulent motions are the main cloud-shaping mechanism for
quiescent clouds, but the density enhancements induced by them quickly become
dominated by gravity (and other mechanisms) which is strongly reflected by the
shape of the column density PDFs. The dominant role of the turbulence is
restricted to the very early stages of molecular cloud evolution, comparable to
the onset of active star formation in the clouds.

a master equation involving transition rates between configurations (detailed
balance is not assumed). To compute the important dynamical time scales in
finite-size systems without simulating the actual time evolution which can be
extremely slow, we propose to focus on first-passage times that satisfy
'backward master equations'. Upon the iterative elimination of configurations,
we obtain the exact renormalization rules that can be followed numerically. To
test this approach, we study the statistics of some first-passage times for two
disordered models : (i) for the random walk in a two-dimensional self-affine
random potential of Hurst exponent $H$, we focus on the first exit time from a
square of size $L \times L$ if one starts at the square center. (ii) for the
dynamics of the ferromagnetic Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model of $N$ spins, we
consider the first passage time $t_f$ to zero-magnetization when starting from
a fully magnetized configuration. Besides the expected linear growth of the
averaged barrier $\bar{\ln t_{f}} \sim N$, we find that the rescaled
distribution of the barrier $(\ln t_{f})$ decays as $e^{- u^{\eta}}$ for large
$u$ with a tail exponent of order $\eta \simeq 1.72$. This value can be simply
interpreted in terms of rare events if the sample-to-sample fluctuation
exponent for the barrier is $\psi_{width}=1/3$.

is partly due to uncertainties about their existence. Are there galaxies
isolated enough to be interesting? Do they exist in sufficient numbers to be
statistically useful? Most attempts to compile isolated galaxy lists were
marginally successful--too small number and not very isolated galaxies. If
really isolated galaxies do exist then their value becomes obvious in a
Universe where effects of interactions and environment (i.e. nurture) are
important. They provide a means for better quantifying effects of nurture. The
Catalog of Isolated Galaxies (CIG) compiled by Valentina Karachentseva appeared
near the beginning of the review period. It becomes the focus of this review
because of its obvious strengths and because the AMIGA project has increased
its utility through a refinement (a vetted CIG). It contains almost 1000
galaxies with nearest neighbor crossing times of 1-3Gyr. It is large enough to
serve as a zero-point or control sample. The galaxies in the CIG (and the
distribution of galaxy types) may be significantly different than those in even
slightly richer environments. The AMIGA-CIG, and future iterations, may be able
to tell us something about galaxy formation. It may also allow us to better
define intrinsic (natural) correlations like e.g. Fisher-Tully and FIR-OPTICAL.
Correlations can be better defined when the dispersion added by external
stimuli (nurture) is minimized or removed.

determined by inelastic neutron scattering and interpreted within the local
moment J_1a,b-J_2 Heisenberg model with orthorhombic symmetry. This has led to
alternative exchange models that strongly differ in the size of anisotropy.
Although the compounds are itinerant the localised spin model can explain basic
features of the excitations. The inherent frustration of this model leads to
quantum fluctuations and possible moment reduction. We investigate this
question in detail using spin wave approximation and partly exact
diagonalisation Lanczos calculations for finite clusters. We find that the
orthorhombic anisotropy stabilizes the columnar AF phase and its moment. For
the exchange models proposed from inelastic neutron scattering we can exclude a
strong influcence of frustration on the moment size. We also investigate
dependence of magnetisation and susceptibility on field and temperature.

originating from a ""spinodal-like"" microstructure with a small degree of
chemical short-range order in the atoms distribution. In the present study we
artificially engineer short-range order by depositing Pd-capped Mg/Ti
multilayers with different periodicities and characterize them both
structurally and optically. Notwithstanding the large lattice parameter
mismatch between Mg and Ti, the as-deposited metallic multilayers show good
structural coherence. Upon exposure to H2 gas a two-step hydrogenation process
occurs, with the Ti layers forming the hydride before Mg. From in-situ
measurements of the bilayer thickness L at different hydrogen pressures, we
observe large out-of-plane expansions of the Mg and Ti layers upon
hydrogenation, indicating strong plastic deformations in the films and a
consequent shortening of the coherence length. Upon unloading at room
temperature in air, hydrogen atoms remain trapped in the Ti layers due to
kinetic constraints. Such loading/unloading sequence can be explained in terms
of the different thermodynamic properties of hydrogen in Mg and Ti, as shown by
diffusion calculations on a model multilayered systems. Absorption isotherms
measured by hydrogenography can be interpreted as a result of the elastic
clamping arising from strongly bonded Mg/Pd and broken Mg/Ti interfaces.

losses exist. This results in reduced throughput and increased transmission
round-trip time when the state of the wireless channel is bad. We propose a new

the probability that two vertices $x, y$ are connected behaves asymptotically

simple random walk on the infinite component converges to an $\alpha$-stable
L\'evy process with $\alpha = s-d$ establishing a conjecture of Berger and
Biskup. The convergence holds in both the quenched and annealed senses. In the
case where $d=1$ and $s>2$ we show that the simple random walk converges to a
Brownian motion. The proof combines heat kernel bounds from our companion
paper, ergodic theory estimates and an involved coupling constructed through
the exploration of a large number of walks on the cluster.

were performed in a diamond-anvil cell up to 27 GPa using neon as
pressure-transmitting medium. In the zircon-structured oxides we found evidence
of a reversible pressure-induced structural phase transformation from zircon to
a monazite-type structure. The onset of the transition is near 17-20 GPa. In
LaPO4 a non-reversible transition is found around 26 GPa, being a barite-type
structure proposed for the high-pressure phase. In the other three monazites,
this structure is found to be stable up to highest pressure reached in the
experiments. No additional phase transitions or evidences of chemical
decomposition are found in the experiments. The equations of state and axial
compressibility for the different phases are also determined. In particular, we
found that in a given compound the monazite structure is less compressible than
zircon structure, being this fact related to the larger packing efficiency of
monazite compared with zircon. The differential bond compressibility of
different polyhedra is also reported and related the anisotropic
compressibility of both structures. Finally, the sequence of structural
transitions and compressibilities are discussed in comparison with other
orhtophosphates.

block for linear quantum computation \cite{linear}, quantum cryptography
\cite{crypto}, quantum teleportation \cite{teleport}, and quantum networks

single-photon pulses on a symmetric beam splitter has been exploited
\cite{review}, which imposes stringent requirement for the implemented single
photons to be indistinguishable in all degrees of freedom, including their
frequencies, spectral widths, pulse shapes, and polarizations. To generate
single photons one requires a pumping mechanism to excite a ""two-level emitter""
and an efficient channeling of the subsequently emitted photons. The efficiency
of the source can be enhanced by coupling the emitter to the waveguide
\cite{manga} or a microcavity mode \cite{cklaw}. However, hitherto the
solid-state single photon sources realized by using a quantum dot coupled with
a microcavity rely on incoherent pumping of excitons, which leads to problems
with timing jitter \cite{kiraz}, leading to a trade off between efficiency and
indistinguishability. Here we introduce a means to realize a highly efficient
solid state source of indistinguishable single photons using cavity-assisted
adiabatic Raman passage in a single quantum dot - cavity system. We demonstrate
pulse-triggered single photons with 100% efficiency and $>90$%
indistinguishability using currently available experimental parameters.
