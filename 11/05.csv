supersymmetric theories with non-zero Fayet-Iliopoulos terms may be
consistently coupled to supergravity. In particular, we examine claims that a
fundamental inconsistency arises due to the conflicting requirements which are
imposed on the $R$-symmetry properties of the theory by the supergravity
framework. We also prove that certain kinds of Fayet-Iliopoulos contributions
to the supercurrent supermultiplets of theories with non-zero Fayet-Iliopoulos
terms fail to exist. A key feature of our discussion is an explicit comparison
between results from the chiral (or ``old minimal'') and linear (or ``new
minimal'') formulations of supergravity, and the effects within each of these
formalisms that are induced by the presence of non-zero Fayet-Iliopoulos terms.

Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET). This is the first application of SCET
to a physical, observable cross section involving energetic partons in more
than two directions. A factorization formula is derived which involves a
non-trivial interplay of the angular dependence in the hard and soft functions,
both quark and gluon jet functions, and multiple partonic channels. The
relevant hard, jet and soft functions are computed to one loop and their
anomalous dimensions are determined to three loops. The final resummed
inclusive direct photon distribution is valid to next-to-next-to-leading
logarithmic order (NNLL), one order beyond previous work. The result is
improved by including non-logarithmic terms and photon isolation cuts through
matching, and compared to Tevatron data and to fixed order results at the
Tevatron and the LHC. The resummed cross section has a significantly smaller
theoretical uncertainty than the next-to-leading fixed-order result,
particularly at high transverse momentum.

$Q_3$), which couple to the Mn $(e_g)$ electrons. Our results show the ground
state to be a type A antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulating state for the
unstrained case, consistent with experiments. With tensile strain (stretching
along the c axis), the ground state changes into a ferromagnetic and eventually
into a type G$^\prime$ AFM structure, while with compressive strain, we find
the type A switching into a type G structure. The orbital ordering, which
displays the well known checkerboard $x^2-1 / y^2-1$ structure for the
unstrained case, retains more or less the same character for compressive
strain, while changing into the $z^2-1$ character for tensile strains. While
$Q_1$ and $Q_3$ are fixed by the strain components $\varepsilon_{xx}$ and
$\varepsilon_{zz}$ in our model, the magnitude of the in-plane distortion mode

bursts with nearly half of them having X-ray flares superimposed on the regular
afterglow decay. Evidence suggests that gamma-ray prompt emission and X-ray
flares share a common origin and that at least some flares can only be
explained by long-lasting central engine activity. We have developed a shell
model code to address the question of how X-ray flares are produced within the
framework of the internal shock model. The shell model creates randomized GRB
explosions from a central engine with multiple shells and follows those shells
as they collide, merge and spread, producing prompt emission and X-ray flares.
We pay special attention to the time history of central engine activity,
internal shocks, and observed flares, but do not calculate the shock dynamics
and radiation processes in detail. Using the empirical E_p - E_iso (Amati)
relation with an assumed Band function spectrum for each collision and an
empirical flare temporal profile, we calculate the gamma-ray (Swift/BAT band)
and X-ray (Swift/XRT band) lightcurves for arbitrary central engine activity
and compare the model results with the observational data. We show that the
observed X-ray flare phenomenology can be explained within the internal shock
model. The number, width and occurring time of flares are then used to diagnose
the central engine activity, putting constraints on the energy, ejection time,
width and number of ejected shells. We find that the observed X-ray flare time
history generally reflects the time history of the central engine, which
reactivates multiple times after the prompt emission phase with progressively
reduced energy...

attempt to constrain the physical origin of the broadband emission and the

the first time allows one to compare the model predictions with flare data from
Sgr A*. Taking into account relevant cooling mechanisms, we calculate the
frequency-dependent time lags and photosphere size expected in the jet model.
The predicted lags and sizes are then compared with recent observations. Both
the observed time lags and size-frequency relationships are reproduced well by
the model. The combined timing and structural information strongly constrain
the speed of the outflow to be mildly relativistic, and the radio flares are
likely to be caused by a transient increase in the matter channelled into the
jets. The model also predicts light curves and structural information at other
wavelengths which could be tested by observations in the near future. We show
that a time-dependent relativistic jet model can successfully reproduce: (1)
the quiescent broadband spectral energy distribution of Sgr A*, (2) the
observed 22 and 43 GHz light curve morphologies and time lags, and (3) the
frequency-size relationship. The results suggest that the observed emission at
radio frequencies from Sgr A* is most easily explained by a stratified,
optically thick, mildly relativistic jet outflow. Frequency-dependent

observed in microquasars during radio flare events could be produced by violent
magnetic reconnection (MR) episodes. Here, we extend this model to other
accretion disk systems, namely: active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and young stellar
objects (YSOs), and also discuss its role on jet heating and particle
acceleration.

window of averaging equal to 365 days. These minima occurred on June 2, 1996

the Special Relativistic effects of aberration and time-of-flight delays and
also rotational sweepback of B-field lines, in the geometric context of polar
cap (PC), outer gap (OG), and two-pole caustic (TPC) pulsar models. In contrast
to the general belief that these very old, rapidly-rotating neutron stars (NSs)
should have largely pair-starved magnetospheres due to the absence of
significant pair production, we find that most of the light curves are best fit
by TPC and OG models, which indicates the presence of narrow accelerating gaps
limited by robust pair production -- even in these pulsars with very low
spin-down luminosities. The gamma-ray pulse shapes and relative phase lags with
respect to the radio pulses point to high-altitude emission being dominant for
all geometries. We also find exclusive differentiation of the current gamma-ray
MSP population into two MSP sub-classes: light curve shapes and lags across
wavebands impose either pair-starved PC (PSPC) or TPC / OG-type geometries. In
the first case, the radio pulse has a small lag with respect to the single
gamma-ray pulse, while the (first) gamma-ray peak usually trails the radio by a
large phase offset in the latter case. Finally, we find that the flux
correction factor as a function of magnetic inclination and observer angles is
typically of order unity for all models. Our calculation of light curves and
flux correction factor for the case of MSPs is therefore complementary to the
""ATLAS paper"" of Watters et al. for younger pulsars.

dominantly accelerated by the winds and supernovae of massive stars, definitive
evidence of this origin remains elusive nearly a century after their discovery
[1]. The active regions of starburst galaxies have exceptionally high rates of
star formation, and their large size, more than 50 times the diameter of
similar Galactic regions, uniquely enables reliable calorimetric measurements
of their potentially high cosmic-ray density [2]. The cosmic rays produced in
the formation, life, and death of their massive stars are expected to
eventually produce diffuse gamma-ray emission via their interactions with
interstellar gas and radiation. M 82, the prototype small starburst galaxy, is
predicted to be the brightest starburst galaxy in gamma rays [3, 4]. Here we
report the detection of >700 GeV gamma rays from M 82. From these data we
determine a cosmic-ray density of 250 eV cm-3 in the starburst core of M 82, or
about 500 times the average Galactic density. This result strongly supports
that cosmic-ray acceleration is tied to star formation activity, and that
supernovae and massive-star winds are the dominant accelerators.

lattices has motivated research on their nonequilibrium behavior. Predictions
on the dynamics of superconductors following a sudden quench of the pairing
interaction have been made based on the effective BCS Hamiltonian; however,
their experimental verification requires the preparation of a suitable excited
state of the Hubbard model along a twofold constraint: (i) a sufficiently
nonadiabatic ramping scheme is essential to excite the nonequilibrium dynamics,
and (ii) overheating beyond the critical temperature of superconductivity must
be avoided. For commonly discussed interaction ramps there is no clear
separation of the corresponding energy scales. Here we show that the matching
of both conditions is simplified by the intrinsic relaxation behavior of
ultracold fermionic systems: For the particular example of a linear ramp we
examine the transient regime of prethermalization [M. Moeckel and S. Kehrein,
Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 175702 (2008)] under the crossover from sudden to
adiabatic switching using Keldysh perturbation theory. A real-time analysis of
the momentum distribution exhibits a temporal separation of an early energy
relaxation and its later thermalization by scattering events. For long but
finite ramping times this separation can be large. In the prethermalization
regime the momentum distribution resembles a zero temperature Fermi liquid as
the energy inserted by the ramp remains located in high energy modes. Thus
ultracold fermions prove robust to heating which simplifies the observation of
nonequilibrium BCS dynamics in optical lattices.

arise only for non-isentropic equations of state given by a generalized form of
the well-known polytropic equation of state with dimension-dependent exponent

function of the entropy (per unit mass). Second, we show that the only
vorticity conserved integrals consist of a circulatory entropy (which vanishes
precisely when the fluid flow is irrotational) in all even dimensions. In
particular, the vorticity integrals for helicity in odd dimensions and
enstrophy in even dimensions are found to be no longer conserved for any

only a modest fraction in a central spheroidal bulge. This poses a major
challenge for cosmological models of galaxy formation. Galaxies form at the
centre of dark matter halos through a combination of hierarchical merging and
gas accretion along cold streams, and should rapidly grow their bulge through
mergers and instabilities. Cosmological simulations predict galaxies to have
most of their mass in the central bulge, and therefore an angular momentum much
below the observed level, except in dwarf galaxies. We propose that the
continuous return of fresh gas by stellar populations over cosmic times could
solve this issue. A population of stars formed at a given instant typically
returns half of its initial mass in the form of gas over 10 billion years, and
the process is not dominated by rapid supernovae explosions but by the
long-term mass-loss from low- and intermediate-mass stars. Using simulations of
galaxy formation, we show that this recycling of gas can strongly affect the
structural evolution of massive galaxies, potentially solving the bulge
fraction issue: we find that the bulge-to-disk ratio of a massive galaxy can be
divided by a factor of 3. The continuous recycling of baryons through star
formation and stellar mass loss helps the growth of disks and their survival to
interactions and mergers. Instead of forming only early-type,
spheroid-dominated galaxies (S0 and ellipticals), the standard cosmological
model can then successfully account for massive late-type, disk-dominated
spiral galaxies (Sb-Sc).

a much richer emission line spectrum in comparison with previous examples of

very prominent in the SWCX spectrum. The observed flux from oxygen ions of 18.9
keV cm-2 s-1 sr-1 is consistent with SWCX resulting from a passing CME. Highly
ionised silicon is also observed in the spectrum, and the presence of highly
charged iron is an additional spectral indicator that we are observing emission

receivers (users) with either a single or multiple-antenna each can be
significantly enhanced by providing the channel state information at the
transmitter (CSIT) of the users, as this allows for scheduling, beamforming and
multiuser multiplexing gains. The traditional view on how to enable CSIT has
been as follows so far: In time-division duplexed (TDD) systems, uplink (UL)
and downlink (DL) channel reciprocity allows the use of a training sequence in
the UL direction, which is exploited to obtain an UL channel estimate. This
estimate is in turn recycled in the next downlink slot. In frequency-division
duplexed (FDD) systems, which lack the UL and DL reciprocity, the CSIT is
provided via the use of a dedicated feedback link of limited capacity between
the receivers and the transmitter. In this paper, we focus on TDD systems and
put this classical approach in question. In particular, we show that the
traditional TDD setup above fails to fully exploit the channel reciprocity in
its true sense. In fact, we show that the system can benefit from a combined
CSIT acquisition strategy mixing the use of limited feedback and that of a
training sequence. This combining gives rise to a very interesting joint
estimation and detection problem for which we propose two iterative algorithms.
An outage rate based framework is also developed which gives the optimal
resource split between training and feedback. We demonstrate the potential of
this hybrid combining in terms of the improved CSIT quality under a global
training and feedback resource constraint.

of knots and links are realized in terms of parametrized unitary matrices for
all dimensions. Two distinct classes are considered. Their (non-local) unitary
actions on separable pure product states of three identical subsystems (say,
the spin projections of three particles) are explicitly evaluated for all

of four terms in the base space. The 3-body and 2-body entanglements (in three
2-body subsystems), the 3-tangles and 2-tangles are explicitly evaluated for
each class. For our matrices, these are parametrized. Varying parameters they
can be made to sweep over the domain (0,1).Thus braiding operators
corresponding to over- and under-crossings of three braids and, on closing
ends, to topologically entangled Borromean rings are shown, in another context,
to generate quantum entanglements. For higher dimensions, starting with
different initial triplets one can entangle by turns, each state with all the
rest. A specific coupling of three angular momenta is briefly discussed to
throw more light on three body entanglements.

necessary to segment the character from the text to sentences, words etc.
Segmentation of words into individual letters has been one of the major
problems in handwriting recognition. Despite several successful works all over
the work, development of such tools in specific languages is still an ongoing
process especially in the Indian context. This work explores the application of
ANN as an aid to segmentation of handwritten characters in Assamese- an
important language in the North Eastern part of India. The work explores the
performance difference obtained in applying an ANN-based dynamic segmentation
algorithm compared to projection- based static segmentation. The algorithm
involves, first training of an ANN with individual handwritten characters
recorded from different individuals. Handwritten sentences are separated out
from text using a static segmentation method. From the segmented line,
individual characters are separated out by first over segmenting the entire
line. Each of the segments thus obtained, next, is fed to the trained ANN. The
point of segmentation at which the ANN recognizes a segment or a combination of
several segments to be similar to a handwritten character, a segmentation
boundary for the character is assumed to exist and segmentation performed. The
segmented character is next compared to the best available match and the
segmentation boundary confirmed.

a target can distinguish the dominant electronrecoil background from the
nuclear recoil signal, based on some discrimination parameter. An acceptance
region is defined inthe parameter space spanned by the recoil energy and this
discrimination parameter. In the absence of a clear signal in thisregion, a
limit is calculated on the dark matter scattering cross section. Here, an
algorithm is presented that allows to define the acceptance region a priori
such that the experiment has the best sensitivity. This is achieved through
optimized acceptance regions for each WIMP model and WIMP mass that is to be
probed. Using recent data from the CRESST-II experiment as anexample, it is
shown that resulting limits can be substantially stronger than those from a
conventional acceptance region. In an experiment with a segmented target, the
algorithm developed here can yield different acceptance regions for the
individual subdetectors. Hence, it is shown how to combine the data
consistently within the usual Maximum Gap or Optimum Interval framework.

by an axoplasmic pressure pulse propagating in the axoplasm along the axon
length. The pressure pulse stretch-modulates voltage-gated Na (Nav) channels
embedded in the axon membrane, causing their accelerated activation and
inactivation and increasing peak channel conductance. As a result, the action
potential propagates due to mechano-electrical activation of Nav channels by
straggling ionic currents and the axoplasmic pressure pulse. The velocity of
such propagation is higher than in the classical purely electrical Nav
activation mechanism, and it may be close to the velocity of propagation of
pressure pulses in the axoplasm. Extracellular Ca ions influxing during the
voltage spike, or Ca ions released from intracellular stores, may trigger a
mechanism that generates and augments the pressure pulse, thus opposing its
viscous decay. The model can potentially explain a number of phenomena that are
not contained within the purely electrical Hodgkin-Huxley-type framework: the
Meyer-Overton rule for the effectiveness of anesthetics, as well as various
mechanical, optical and thermodynamic phenomena accompanying the action
potential. It is shown that the velocity of propagation of axoplasmic pressure
pulses is close to the measured velocity of the nerve impulse, both in absolute
magnitude and in dependence on axon diameter, degree of myelination and
temperature.

on spatial scales of $>3$ degrees is revealed as an excess in the local density
of sub-giant stars. With an appropriate assumption of a model stellar isochrone
it is possible for us to then derive distances to the sub-giant population. We
describe three new candidate halo substructures; the 160- and 180-degree
over-densities (at distances of 17 and 19 kpc respectively and radii of 1.3 and
1.5 kpc respectively) and an extended feature at 28 kpc that covers at least
162 square degrees, the Virgo Equatorial Stream. In addition, we recover the
Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr) leading arm material and the Virgo Over-density.
  The derived distances, together with the number of sub-giant stars associated
with each substructure, enables us to derive the integrated luminosity for the
features. The tenuous, low surface brightness of the features strongly suggests
an origin from the tidal disruption of an accreted galaxy or galaxies. Given
the dominance of the tidal debris of Sgr in this region of the sky we
investigate if our observations can be accommodated by tidal disruption models

transform driven by its large number of applications. The literature in this
field follows two main routes. On the one hand, the areas where the ordinary
Fourier transform has been applied are being revisited to use this intermediate
time-frequency representation of signals, and on the other hand, fast
algorithms for numerical computation of the fractional Fourier transform are
devised. In this paper we derive a Gaussian-like quadrature of the continuous
fractional Fourier transform. This quadrature is given in terms of the Hermite
polynomials and their zeros. By using some asymptotic formulas, we rewrite the
quadrature as a chirp-fft-chirp transformation, yielding a fast discretization
of the fractional Fourier transform and its inverse in closed form. We extend
the range of the fractional Fourier transform by considering arbitrary complex
values inside the unitary circle and not only at the boundary. We find that,
the chirp-fft-chirp transformation evaluated at z=i, becomes a more accurate
version of the fft which can be used for non-periodic functions.

However, when we look at the metallicity of the GCs as a function of age, we
find 92% of metal-poor GCs and 56% of metal-rich GCs in NGC 5128 have ages > 8
Gyr, indicating that the majority of both metallicity subpopulations of GCs
formed early, with a significant population of young and metal-rich GCs forming
later. Our metallicity distribution function generated directly from
spectroscopic Lick indices is clearly bimodal, as is the color distribution of
the same set of GCs. Thus the metallicity bimodality is real and not an
artifact of the color to metallicity conversion. The [alpha/Fe] values are
supersolar with a mean value of 0.14pm0.04, indicating a fast formation
timescale. However, the GCs in NGC 5128 are not as [alpha/Fe] enhanced as the
Milky Way GCs also examined in this study. Our results support a rapid, early

order to examine the physical conditions for the existence of such winds for a
wide variety of initial conditions. We built a simple and fast non-hydrodynamic
model, QWIND, where we assume that a wind is launched from the accretion disc
at supersonic velocities of the order of a few 10^2 km/s and we concentrate on
the subsequent supersonic phase. We show that this model can produce a wind
with terminal velocities of the order of 10^4 km/s. There are three zones in
the wind, only the middle one of which can launch a wind: in the inner zone the
wind is too ionized and so experiences only the Compton radiation force which
is not effective in accelerating gas. This inner failed wind however plays an
important role in shielding the next zone, lowering the ionization parameter
there. In the middle zone the lower ionization of the gas leads to a much
larger radiation force and the gas achieves escape velocity This middle zone is
quite thin (about 100 gravitational radii). The outer, third, zone is shielded
from the UV radiation by the central wind zone and so does not achieve a high
enough acceleration to reach escape velocity. We also describe a simple
analytic approximation of our model, based on neglecting the effects of gravity
during the acceleration phase. This analytic approach is in agreement with the
results of the numerical code, and is a powerful way to check whether a
radiation driven wind can be accelerated with a given set of initial
parameters. Our analytical analysis and the fast QWIND model are in agreement
with more complex hydrodynamical models, and allow an exploration of the
dependence of the wind properties for a wide set of initial parameters: black
hole mass, Eddington ratio, initial density profile, X-ray to UV ratio.

ultraviolet. The requirement of a finite variance in position space forces one
to regularize $\Delta^2(k, t)$. This can (and should) be achieved by proper
renormalization in an expanding universe in a unique way. This affects the
predicted scalar and tensorial power spectra (evaluated when the modes acquire
classical properties) for wavelengths that today are at observable scales. As a
consequence, the imprint of slow-roll inflation on the CMB anisotropies is
significantly altered. We find a non-trivial change in the consistency
condition that relates the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ to the spectral indices.
For instance, an exact scale-invariant tensorial power spectrum, $n_t=0$, is
now compatible with a non-zero ratio $r\approx 0.12\pm0.06$, which is forbidden
by the standard prediction ($r=-8n_t$). The influence of relic gravitational

is it possible to capture certain quantum idiosyncrasies within the symplectic

a classical system involved associating the phase space variables with
Hermitian operators which act on some Hilbert space, as well as associating the
Poisson bracket on the phase space with the commutator for the operators.
Mathematically the phase space is associated with some symplectic manifold $M$
and the non-degenerate 2-form $\omega$, which comes with $M$. Geometric
prequantization is a process by which one does this in a mathematically
""rigorous"" manner and we shall attempt to just introduce the methods here. We
do this by exploring this contruction for ($\mathbb{R}^{2n}, \sum_{i=1}^n dp_i

One should note however that the Hilbert space one obtains is in fact too
""big"", in the sense that it has too many functions in order to correspond with
actual physically significant Hilbert spaces. Geometric quantization remedies
this situation but it should be noted that not all manifolds are
prequantizable. We shall not discuss either of these issues however.

BSSN system using pseudospectral methods. For our simulations we use the SGRID
code where the BSSN system is implemented in its standard second order in space
form. Previously we found that such simulations are quite unstable. The main
goal of this paper is to present two improvements which now allow us to evolve
for longer times. The first improvement is related to the boundary conditions
at the excised black hole interior. We now use a gauge condition that ensures
that all modes are going into the black hole, so that no boundary conditions
are needed at the excision surface. The second more significant improvement has
to do with our particular numerical method and involves filters based on
projecting the double Fourier expansions used for the angular dependence onto
Spherical Harmonics. With these two improvements it is now easily possible to
evolve for several thousand $M$. The only remaining limitation seems to be the
radiative outer boundary conditions used here. Yet this problem can be
ameliorated by pushing out the location of the outer boundary, which leads to
even longer run-times.

observable ways, and a strong constraint on the mass can be achieved using
combinations of cosmological data sets. We focus on the power spectrum of
cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, the Hubble constant H_0, and
the length scale for baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) to investigate the
constraint on the neutrino mass, m_nu. We analyze data from multiple existing
CMB studies (WMAP5, ACBAR, CBI, BOOMERANG, and QUAD), recent measurement of H_0
(SHOES), with about two times lower uncertainty (5%) than previous estimates,
and recent treatments of BAO from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We
obtained an upper limit of m_nu < 0.2eV (95% C.L.), for a flat LambdaCDM model.
This is a 40% reduction in the limit derived from previous H_0 estimates and
one-third lower than can be achieved with extant CMB and BAO data. We also
analyze the impact of smaller uncertainty on measurements of H_0 as may be
anticipated in the near term, in combination with CMB data from the Planck
mission, and BAO data from the SDSS/BOSS program. We demonstrate the
possibility of a 5 sigma detection for a fiducial neutrino mass of 0.1eV or a
95% upper limit of 0.04eV for a fiducial of m_nu = 0eV. These constraints are
about 50% better than those achieved without external constraint. We further
investigate the impact on modeling where the dark-energy equation of state is
constant but not necessarily -1, or where a non-flat universe is allowed. In
these cases, the next-generation accuracies of Planck, BOSS, and 1% measurement
of H_0 would all be required to obtain the limit m_nu < 0.05 - 0.06eV (95%
C.L.) for the fiducial of m_nu = 0eV. The independence of systematics argues
for pursuit of both BAO and H_0 measurements.

Instead of representations on finite dimensional vector spaces we look at

allowed to drift and rotate slowly, but by using advanced metrology and
statistical modelling methods, their relative positions, velocities, and
orientations are determined with very high accuracy. The metrology data is used
directly by the payloads to compensate for spacecraft motions in software. The
normally very stringent spacecraft control requirements are thereby relaxed,
which significantly reduces mission complexity and cost. Space-borne
low-frequency radio astronomy has been identified as a key science application
for a conceptual pathfinder mission using this novel approach. The mission,

the energy gap analysis. For the infinite-ranged spin-glass models with a
transverse field, we find that a strong sample-to-sample fluctuation effect
leads to broad distributions of the energy gap. As a result, the linear,
spin-glass, and nonlinear susceptibilities behave differently from each other.
The power-law tail of the distribution implies a quantum Griffiths-like effect
that could be observed in various random quantum systems. We also discuss the
mechanisms of the phase transition in terms of the energy gap by comparing the
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model and random energy model, which demonstrate the
difference between the continuous and discontinuous phase transitions.

two advances toward such a theorem, in the black-box model where most quantum

  First, we show that for any problem that is invariant under permuting inputs
and outputs (like the collision or the element distinctness problems), the
quantum query complexity is at least the 7th root of the classical randomized
query complexity. (An earlier version of this paper gave the 9th root.) This
resolves a conjecture of Watrous from 2002.
  Second, inspired by recent work of O'Donnell et al. (2005) and Dinur et al.
(2006), we conjecture that every bounded low-degree polynomial has a ""highly
influential"" variable. Assuming this conjecture, we show that every T-query
quantum algorithm can be simulated on most inputs by a poly(T)-query classical
algorithm, and that one essentially cannot hope to prove P!=BQP relative to a

1.7-13.3% range, the amplitude being higher at higher energies. We have fitted
the PDS of the observations with Lorentzian and power law models. Energy
spectra are derived for those observations in which the QPOs are detected to
investigate any dependence of the QPO characteristic on the spectral
parameters. These spectra are well fitted with a two component model that

possible to design well-founded multi-scale modeling tools that can link
microscopic models with macroscopic constitutive equations. Such multi-scale
modeling tools benefit from recently proposed approaches for static coarse
graining which are mainly built on potentials of mean force. For dynamical
properties, however, coarse-grained models need to account for dissipative
effects that arise due to fast degrees of freedom that are eliminated in favor
of the remaining slowly varying ones. The proper definition of the set of the
state variables, effectively representing the nonequilibrium states is the
first key to the success of such an approach. Linking the microscopic model
with a macroscopic model built on these slowly relaxing variables is the second
key. We illustrate the new approach for a flowing, low-molecular polymer melt.

further improve the previous study to include the hadronic branching ratio of

the hadronic branching ratio. We find that the 95% ($2\sigma$) upper limits of

is some smaller than previous works since the constraint from $\gamma$-rays is
involved. However, it is still capable to be detected by the forth-coming

observations of one of the most extreme Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxies,
IRAS13224-3809. The X-ray spectrum is characterized by two main peculiar
features, i) a strong soft excess with a steep rise below about 1.3 keV and ii)
a deep drop in flux above 8.2 keV. We focus here on a reflection-based
interpretation which interprets both features, as well as the large soft
excess, in terms of partially ionized reflection off the inner accretion disc.
We show that the two peculiar spectral features mentioned above can be
reproduced by two relativistic emission lines due to Fe K and Fe L. The lines
are produced in the inner accretion disc and independently yield consistent
disc parameters. We argue that the high L/K intensity ratio is broadly
consistent with expectations from an ionized accretion disc reflection,
indicating that they belong to a single ionized reflection component. The
spectral shape, X-ray flux, and variability properties are very similar in the
XMM-Newton and Suzaku observations, performed about 5 years apart. The overall
X-ray spectrum and variability can be described by a simple two-component model
comprising a steep power law continuum plus its ionised reflection off the
inner accretion disc. In this model, a rapidly rotating Kerr black hole and a
steep emissivity profile are required to describe the data. The simultaneous
detection of broad relativistic Fe L and K lines in IRAS 13224-3809 follows
that in another extreme NLS1 galaxy, 1H0707-495. Although the data quality for
IRAS13224-3809 does not allow us to rule out competing models as in 1H0707-495,
we show here that our reflection-based interpretation describes in a
self-consistent manner the available data and points towards IRAS13224-3809
being a very close relative of 1H0707-495 in terms of both spectral and
variability properties.

obtained at the 0.8-m Tsinghua University-National Astronomical Observatory of
China telescope (TNT) at Xinglong Observatory. Our follow-up observations were
performed from 512 sec after the burst trigger. With the upper limit of
redshift $\sim$0.7, GRB 070518 is found to be an optically dim burst. The
spectra indices $\beta_{ox}$ of optical to X-ray are slightly larger than 0.5,
which implies the burst might be a dark burst. The extinction $A_{V}$ of the
host galaxy is 3.2 mag inferred from the X-ray hydrogen column density with
Galactic extinction law, and 0.3 mag with SMC extinction law. Also, it is
similar to three other low-redshift optically dim bursts, which belong to XRR
or XRF, and mid-term duration($T_{90}<10$, except for GRB 070419A,
$T_{90}$=116s). Moreover, its $R$ band afterglow flux is well fitted by a
single power-law with an index of 0.87. The optical afterglow and the X-ray
afterglow in the normal segment might have the same mechanism, as they are
consistent with the prediction of the classical external shock model. Besides,
GRB 070518 agrees with Amati relation under reasonable assumptions. The
Ghirlanda relation is also tested with the burst.

accelerating through the inertial vacuum with a constant acceleration $g$, will
behave as though it is immersed in a radiation field with temperature
$T=(g/2\pi)$. We study a generalization of this result for detectors moving
with a time-dependent acceleration $g(\tau)$ along a given direction. After
defining the rate of excitation of the detector appropriately, we evaluate this
rate for time-dependent acceleration, $g(\tau)$, to linear order in the
parameter $\eta = \dot g / g^2$. In this case, we have three length scales in
the problem: $g^{-1}, (\dot g/g)^{-1}$ and $\omega^{-1}$ where $\omega$ is the
energy difference between the two levels of the detector at which the spectrum
is probed. We show that: (a) When $\omega^{-1} \ll g^{-1} \ll (\dot g/g)^{-1}$,
the rate of transition of the detector corresponds to a slowly varying
temperature $T(\tau) = g(\tau)/2 \pi $, as one would have expected. (b)
However, when $ g^{-1}\ll \omega^{-1} \ll (\dot g/g)^{-1}$, we find that the
spectrum is modified \textit{even at the order $\mathcal{O}(\eta)$}. This is
counter-intuitive because, in this case, the relevant frequency does not probe
the rate of change of the acceleration since $(\dot g/g) \ll \omega$ and we
certainly do not have deviation from the thermal spectrum when $\dot g =0$.
This result shows that there is a subtle discontinuity in the behaviour of
detectors with $\dot g = 0$ and $\dot g/g^2$ being arbitrarily small. We
corroborate this result by evaluating the detector response for a particular
trajectory which admits an analytic expression for the poles of the Wightman
function.

relation, and is therefore complementary to an analogous ongoing effort of
investigation of the dispersion relation in the ultrarelativistic regime using
observations in astrophysics. For the leading correction in the nonrelativistic
limit the exceptional sensitivity of cold-atom-recoil experiments remarkably
allows us to set a limit within a single order of magnitude of the desired
Planck-scale level, thereby providing the first example of Planck-scale
sensitivity in the study of the dispersion relation in controlled laboratory
experiments. For the next-to-leading term we obtain a limit which is a few
orders of magnitude away from the Planck scale, but still amounts to the best
limit on a class of Lorentz-symmetry test theories that has been extensively

motion of two biological entities interacting via chemotaxis when time delay
and degradation of the chemical are ignored. This problem also bears some
similarities with the stochastic motion of two point vortices in viscous
hydrodynamics [Agullo & Verga, Phys. Rev. E, 63, 056304 (2001)]. We
analytically obtain the density probability of finding the particles at a
distance r from each other at time t. We also determine the probability that
the particles have coalesced and formed a Dirac peak at time t (i.e. the
probability that the reduced particle has reached r=0 at time t). Finally, we
investigate the variance of the distribution <r^2> and discuss the proper form
of the virial theorem for this system. The reduced particle has a normal
diffusion behaviour for small times with a gravity-modified diffusion
coefficient <r^2>=r_0^2+(4k_B/\xi\mu)(T-T_*)t, where k_BT_{*}=Gm_1m_2/2 is a
critical temperature, and an anomalous diffusion for large times
<r^2>~t^(1-T_*/T). As a by-product, our solution also describes the growth of
the Dirac peak (condensate) that forms in the post-collapse regime of the
Smoluchowski-Poisson system (or Keller-Segel model) for T<T_c=GMm/(4k_B). We
find that the saturation of the mass of the condensate to the total mass is
algebraic in an infinite domain and exponential in a bounded domain.

membrane, originally developed for electrochemical systems. Within such a
framework, corrections to the elastic moduli of the membrane are obtained,
which arise from charge accumulation in the Debye layers due to capacitive
effects and electric currents through the membrane and can lead to an
undulation instability of the membrane. The fluid flow surrounding the membrane
is also calculated, which clarifies issues regarding these flows sharing many
similarities with flows produced by induced charge electro-osmosis (ICEO).
Non-equilibrium steady states of the membrane and of the fluid can be
effectively described by this method. It is both simpler, due to the zero

an order of reproduced expectations. When the expectations operate upon one
another, they generate a non-linear dynamics that processes meaning. Specific
meaning can be stabilized, for example, in social institutions, but all meaning
arises from a horizon of possible meanings. Using Luhmann's (1984) social
systems theory and Rosen's (1985) theory of anticipatory systems, I submit
equations for modeling the processing of meaning in inter-human communication.
First, a self-referential system can use a model of itself for the
anticipation. Under the condition of functional differentiation, the social
system can be expected to entertain a set of models; each model can also
contain a model of the other models. Two anticipatory mechanisms are then
possible: one transversal between the models, and a longitudinal one providing
the modeled systems with meaning from the perspective of hindsight. A system
containing two anticipatory mechanisms can become hyper-incursive. Without
making decisions, however, a hyper-incursive system would be overloaded with
uncertainty. Under this pressure, informed decisions tend to replace the
""natural preferences"" of agents and an order of cultural expectations can
increasingly be shaped.

and is sufficient to make identification by an optical microscope possible. The
graphene layers cover the crystalline substrate in a carpet-like mode and the
height of single layer graphene on any of the crystalline substrates as
determined by atomic force microscopy is $d_{SLG}=0.34$ nm and thus much
smaller than on SiO$_2$.

with alternative suggestions including: a fossil remnant of a group merger,
non-thermal emission from a radio galaxy, and projected emission from of a
filamentary string of galaxies. We report on our analysis of the Chandra
observation and evaluate these hypotheses based on our results. Abell 3120
shows X-ray emission extending 158 kpc, well beyond the central galaxy. The
spatial distribution of X-rays in the core more closely follows the radio
emission showing a jet-like structure extending to the north that is misaligned
with the stellar light distribution of the central galaxy. At larger radii the
X-ray emission is aligned with the SE-NW running axis of the galaxy
distribution in the cluster core. Modeling the X-ray spectrum excludes purely
non-thermal emission. The emission weighted temperature is 1.93 - 2.19 keV and
the 0.3 - 10 keV luminosity is 1.23$\times10^{43}$ ergs s$^{-1}$. Abell 3120
appears to be a poor cluster with Virgo and MKW 4 as peers. The best fitting
model consists of a thermal component and a second component that may be either
thermal or non-thermal, with luminosity 25% of the total X-ray luminosity.
While, a more detailed spatial-spectral search failed to detect a central AGN,
there is some evidence for an extended hard X-ray component. Cooler gas, 1.28 -
1.80 was detected in the central 20 kpc. The second thermal component
marginally requires a higher redshift, >0.12, which may be due to a second
cluster in the rich surrounding environment consisting of nearly a thousand
catalogued galaxies.

scalar, in the limit where the scalar field goes to infinity, accompanied by a
suitable scaling of the metric. We propose that no scalar potential is present
for the dilatation symmetric quantum effective action at the fixed point.
Dimensional reduction of such a higher dimensional effective action leads to
solutions with a vanishing effective four-dimensional constant. Under rather
general circumstances these are the only quasistatic stable solutions with
finite four-dimensional gravitational constant. If cosmological runaway
solutions approach the fixed point as time goes to infinity, the cosmological
constant vanishes asymptotically. For our old Universe the fixed point is not
yet reached completely, resulting in a tiny amount of dark energy, comparable
to dark matter. We discuss explicitly higher dimensional geometries which
realize such asymptotic solutions for $t\to\infty$. They include Ricci-flat
spaces as well as warped spaces, potentially with singularities.
