instability is investigated, as a first step toward a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
theory of the stationary accretion shock instability taking place during
stellar core collapse. We study a toy model where the flow behind a planar
stationary accretion shock is adiabatically decelerated by an external
potential. Two magnetic field geometries are considered: parallel or
perpendicular to the shock. The entropy-vorticity wave, which is simply
advected in the unmagnetized limit, separates into five different waves: the
entropy perturbations are advected, while the vorticity can propagate along the
field lines through two Alfven waves and two slow magnetosonic waves. The two
cycles existing in the unmagnetized limit, advective-acoustic and purely
acoustic, are replaced by up to six distinct MHD cycles. The phase differences
among the cycles play an important role in determining the total cycle
efficiency and hence the growth rate. Oscillations in the growth rate as a
function of the magnetic field strength are due to this varying phase shift. A
vertical magnetic field hardly affects the cycle efficiency in the regime of
super-Alfvenic accretion that is considered. In contrast, we find that a
horizontal magnetic field strongly increases the efficiencies of the vorticity
cycles that bend the field lines, resulting in a significant increase of the
growth rate if the different cycles are in phase. These magnetic effects are
significant for large-scale modes if the Alfven velocity is a sizable fraction
of the flow velocity.

potential. Unlike the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), the stop
masses can be very heavy. We then discuss possible CP violation in the Higgs
sector, which can be both spontaneous and explicit, even at tree level. The
spontaneous violation provides a direct source for baryogenesis, while its
magnitude is mediated by an explicit phase from the secluded sector. These new
CP sources do not introduce significant new contributions to electric dipole
moments. EWBG in the thin wall ($\tau$ leptons) and thick wall regimes (top
squarks, charginos and top quarks) are systematically discussed. We find that
the CP-violating stop and chargino currents are very different from those
obtained in the MSSM. Due to the space-dependence of the relevant CP phases,
they do not require a variation of $\tan \beta$ in the bubble wall to have a
non-trivial structure at the lowest order of Higgs insertion. In addition to
$\tau$ leptons, top squarks and charginos, we find that top quarks can also
play a significant role. Numerical results show that the baryon asymmetry is
large enough to explain the cosmological observation today. We illustrate that
EWBG and neutralino cold dark matter can be accommodated in the same framework,
i.e., there exists parameter space where a strong enough first order EWPT,
large CP phase variations across the bubble wall, a reasonable baryon asymmetry
as well as an acceptable neutralino dark matter relic density can be achieved

$\to$ 6$_{-2,5}$) line and 890 $\mu$m continuum observations made with the
Submillimeter Array (SMA) towards the hot molecular circumbinary ring
associated with the young multiple star Ori 139-409 are presented. The
CH$_3$OH(7$_{-2,6}$ - 6$_{-2,5}$) emission from the ring is well resolved at
this angular resolution revealing an inner cavity with a size of about 140 AU.
A LTE model of a Keplerian disk with an inner cavity of the same size confirms
the presence of this cavity. Additionally, this model suggests that the
circumbinary ring is contracting with a velocity of V$_{inf}$ $\sim$ 1.5 km
s$^{-1}$ toward the binary central compact circumstellar disks reported at a
wavelength of 7 mm. {\bf The inner central cavity seems to be formed by the
tidal effects of the young stars in the middle of the ring.} The ring appears
to be not a stationary object. Furthermore, the infall velocity we determine is
about a factor of 3 slower than the free-fall velocity corresponding to the
dynamical mass. This would correspond to a mass accretion rate of about
10$^{-5}$ M$_\odot$/yr. We found that the dust emission associated with Ori
139-409 appears to be arising from the circumstellar disks with no strong
contribution from the molecular gas ring. A simple comparison with other
classical molecular dusty rings (e.g. GG Tau, UZ Tau, and UY Aur) suggests that
Ori 139-409 could be one of the youngest circumbinary rings reported up to
date. Finally, our results confirm that the circumbinary rings are actively
funneling fresh gas material to the central compact binary circumstellar disks,
i.e. to the protostars in the very early phases of their evolution.

arises from relatively low down in the magnetosphere. High-quality radio

expansion law expected for a short impulse of X-rays scattered by three dust
clouds. Assuming different models for the dust composition and grain size
distribution, we fit the intensity decay of each ring as a function of time at
different energies, obtaining tight constrains on the distance of the X-ray
source. Although the distance strongly depends on the adopted dust model, we
find that some models are incompatible with our X-ray data, restricting to 4-8
kpc the range of possible distances for 1E 1547.0-5408. The best-fitting dust
model provides a source distance of 3.91 +/- 0.07 kpc, which is compatible with
the proposed association with the supernova remnant G 327.24-0.13, and implies
distances of 2.2 kpc, 2.6 kpc and 3.4 kpc for the dust clouds, in good
agreement with the dust distribution inferred by CO line observations towards

obtained for a set of similarly well-fitting models that imply a source
distance of about 5 kpc. A distance of about 4-5 kpc is also favored by the
fact that these dust models are already known to provide good fits to the
dust-scattering halos of bright X-ray binaries.

only contains two physical degrees of freedom. However, in an expanding
universe, consistently eliminating one of the ""unphysical"" states in the
covariant (Gupta-Bleuler) formalism turns out to be difficult to realize. In
this work we explore the possibility of quantization without subsidiary
conditions. This implies that the theory would contain a third physical state.
The presence of such a new (temporal) electromagnetic mode on cosmological
scales is shown to generate an effective cosmological constant which can
account for the accelerated expansion of the universe. This new polarization
state is completely decoupled from charged matter, but can be excited
gravitationally. In fact, primordial electromagnetic quantum fluctuations
produced during electroweak scale inflation could naturally explain the
presence of this mode and also the measured value of the cosmological constant.
The theory is compatible with all the local gravity tests, it is free from
classical or quantum instabilities and reduces to standard QED in the flat
space-time limit. Thus we see that, not only the true nature of dark energy can
be established without resorting to new physics, but also the value of the
cosmological constant finds a natural explanation in the context of standard
inflationary cosmology. Possible signals, discriminating this model from LCDM,
are also discussed.

interference terms with eta(eta') and f1 exchanges dominate in the transverse

the longitudinal cross section sigmaL is generated by a series of scalar meson
exchanges. To extract the dominant term more detailed information on the inner

accuracy if one proposes the quarkonium structure for the heavy scalar mesons

correlations, evincing an emergent ferromagnetic tendency in this material
despite the large negative Curie-Weiss constant. Here, we argue instead that
the ordered state is dominated by $Q \neq 0$ correlations that emerge either
from strong antiferromagnetism or magnetoelastic distortion of the crystal. In
contrast to previous reports, we observe no evidence for re-entrant behaviour
in the high field limit. Extreme sensitivity of the ordered state to the

from a one-particle model. Superconductivity appears when the electronic energy
gains of the band structure surpass the energy needed for atomic vibrations or
magnetic moment oscillations. The vibration/oscillation amplitudes determine
the superconducting gap, and the Fermi surface is important for the
q-dependence. This permits for complementary interpretations of the parameters
for superconductivity and modeling of density-of-state effects. It also makes
the superconducting mechanism less exotic.

charm-anticharm pairs whose constituent quarks originate from two different
hard processes. Like the surviving J/psi states, the recombinant J/psi also
undergo both a stochastic interaction, determined by a hydrodynamical
simulation of the heavy-ion collision, and an interaction determined by the
heavy quark-antiquark potentials measured on the lattice for appropriate
temperatures. From the results of these simulations, we determine both the
direct and the recombinant contribution to the J/psi yields for RHIC
conditions, and find that for central collisions, between 30% and 50% of the
J/psi yield is due to recombinant production. We compare our results with other
models and look for how the recombinant contribution differs from the surviving
contribution in the differential p_t yields. Including the recombinant
contribution improves the agreement with the latest analysis of charmonium at
RHIC, which shows an absence of anomalous suppression except in the most

Voyagers 1 and 2 crossed the heliospheric termination shock have called into
question the conventional shock source of these energetic particles. We suggest
that the sectored heliospheric magnetic field, which results from the flapping
of the heliospheric current sheet, piles up as it approaches the heliopause,
narrowing the current sheets that separate the sectors and triggering the onset
of collisionless magnetic reconnection. Particle-in-cell simulations reveal
that most of the magnetic energy is released and most of this energy goes into
energetic ions with significant but smaller amounts of energy going into
electrons. The energy gain of the most energetic ions results from their
reflection from the ends of contracting magnetic islands, a first order Fermi
process. The energy gain of the ions in contracting islands increases their
parallel (to the magnetic field ${\bf B}$) pressure $p_\parallel$ until the
marginal firehose condition is reached, causing magnetic reconnection and
associated particle acceleration to shut down. The model calls into question
the strong scattering assumption used to derive the Parker transport equation
and therefore the absence of first order Fermi acceleration in incompressible
flows. A simple 1-D model for particle energy gain and loss is presented in
which the feedback of the energetic particles on the reconnection drive is
included. The ACR differential energy spectrum takes the form of a power law
with a spectral index slightly above 1.5. The model has the potential to
explain several key Voyager observations, including the similarities in the
spectra of different ion species.

years our knowledge and understanding of the Universe has changed not only
quantitatively but also, and most importantly, qualitatively. Cosmologists rely
on data where a host of useful information is enclosed, but is encoded in a
non-trivial way. The challenges in extracting this information must be overcome
to make the most of a large experimental effort. Even after having converged to
a standard cosmological model (the LCDM model) we should keep in mind that this
model is described by 10 or more physical parameters and if we want to study
deviations from it, the number of parameters is even larger. Dealing with such
a high dimensional parameter space and finding parameters constraints is a
challenge on itself. Cosmologists want to be able to compare and combine
different data sets both for testing for possible disagreements (which could
indicate new physics) and for improving parameter determinations. Finally,
cosmologists in many cases want to find out, before actually doing the
experiment, how much one would be able to learn from it. For all these reasons,
sophisiticated statistical techniques are being employed in cosmology, and it
has become crucial to know some statistical background to understand recent
literature in the field. I will introduce some statistical tools that any
cosmologist should know about in order to be able to understand recently
published results from the analysis of cosmological data sets. I will not
present a complete and rigorous introduction to statistics as there are several
good books which are reported in the references. The reader should refer to

logical to be entitled the open one, for the case of a one-component system of
ordinary particles. Its peculiarity is in complementing the consideration of a
system with the inclusion of a certain surrounding area. The calculations
indicate the necessity of taking into account the surface that delimits a given
system even in the case when the latter is a part of a uniform medium and is
not singled out one way or another.
  The surface tension coefficient behaves unlike two-phase systems in
equilibrium and depends on two variables - pressure as well as temperature -
and belongs to the boundary separating a hard solid from a fluid. As for the
mathematical mechanism ensuring the fulfillment of thermodynamic relations, the
emphasis is shifted from operating with series, like in the grand canonical
ensemble, towards employing the recurrence relations of a new class of
functions that incorporate Boltzmann and Ursell factors as their extreme cases
and towards utilizing generating functions.
  The second topic of discussion that the present article deals with is the
consideration of the surface tension and adsorption observed at the boundary of
a solid body and a liquid or gas carried out on the basis of the analysis of
the classical system found in a field of force of general type. The surface
terms are calculated with the aid of field functions and the correlation
functions of an unperturbed volume phase and behave somewhat vaguely;
particularly, as a function of activity, they may start with a linear or
quadratic term.

of galaxies and galaxy clusters has most likely a clumpy structure. If a stream
of gas penetrates through it, a small-scale gravitational field created by the
clumps disturbs the flow resulting in momentum exchange between the stream and
the dark matter. In this article, we perform an analysis of this effect, based
on the hierarchial halo model of the dark matter structure and
Navarro-Frenk-White density profiles. We consider the clumps of various masses,
from the smallest up to the highest ones $M\ge 10^{9} M_\odot$. It has been
found that in any event the effect grows with the mass of the clump: not only
the drag force $\mathfrak F$ acting on the clump, but also its acceleration
$w=\mathfrak F/M$ increases.
  We discuss various astrophysical systems. The mechanism proved to be
ineffective in the case of galaxy or galaxy cluster collisions. On the other
hand, it played an important role during the process of galaxy formation. As a
result, the dark matter should have formed a more compact, oblate, and faster
rotating substructure in the halo of our Galaxy. We have shown that this thick
disk should be more clumpy than the halo. This fact is very important for the
indirect detection experiments since it is the clumps that give the main
contribution to the annihilation signal. Our calculations show that the
mechanism of momentum exchange between the dark and baryon matter is
ineffective on the outskirts of the galactic halo. It means that the clumps
from there were not transported to the thick disk, and this regions should be
more clumpy than the halo on the average.

arise naturally in string networks prior to loop formation. The angular
momentum of the string in the compact space may then be sufficient to ensure
that the windings remain stable after the loop chops off from the network, even
if the internal manifold is simply connected. For concreteness we embed our
model in the Klebanov-Strassler geometry, which provides a natural mechanism
for brane inflation, as well a being one of the best understood
compactification schemes in type IIB string theory. We see that the interaction
of angular momentum with the string tension causes the loop to oscillate
between phases of expansion and contraction. This, in principle, should give
rise to a distinct gravitational wave signature, the future detection of which
could provide indirect evidence for the existence of extra dimensions.

-5.232+/-0.020 for epsilon Indi Ba, Bb, respectively, and using the dynamical
system mass and COND03 evolutionary models predict a system age of 3.7--4.3

galaxies within a hierarchical universe. Similarly to standard semi-analytical
models we trace galaxies inside dark-matter merger-trees. The formalism
includes treatment of feedback, star-formation, cooling, smooth accretion, gas
stripping in satellite galaxies, and merger-induced star bursts. However,
unlike in other models, each process is assumed to have an efficiency which
depends only on the host halo mass and redshift. This allows us to describe the
various components of the model in a simple and transparent way. By allowing
the efficiencies to have any value for a given halo mass and redshift, we can
easily encompass a large range of scenarios. To demonstrate this point, we
examine several different galaxy formation models, which are all consistent
with the observational data. Each model is characterized by a different unique
feature: cold accretion in low mass haloes, zero feedback, stars formed only in
merger-induced bursts, and shutdown of star-formation after mergers. Using
these models we are able to examine the degeneracy inherent in galaxy formation
models, and look for observational data that will help to break this
degeneracy. We show that the full distribution of star-formation rates in a
given stellar mass bin is promising in constraining the models. We compare our
approach in detail to the semi-analytical model of De Lucia & Blaizot. It is
shown that our formalism is able to produce a very similar population of
galaxies once the same median efficiencies per halo mass and redshift are being
used. We provide a public version of the model galaxies on our web-page, along
with a tool for running models with user-defined parameters. Our model is able
to provide results for a 62.5 h^{-1} Mpc box within just a few seconds.

powerful tool to search for planets around cool stars and sub-stellar objects.
However, no technique currently exists that yields near-infrared radial
velocity precision comparable to that routinely obtained in the visible. We
describe a method for measuring high-precision relative radial velocities of
these stars from K-band spectra. The method makes use of a glass cell filled
with ammonia gas to calibrate the spectrograph response similar to the ""iodine
cell"" technique that has been used very successfully in the visible. Stellar
spectra are obtained through the ammonia cell and modeled as the product of a
Doppler-shifted template spectrum of the object and a spectrum of the cell,
convolved with a variable instrumental profile model. A complicating factor is
that a significant number of telluric absorption lines are present in the
spectral regions containing useful stellar and ammonia lines. The telluric
lines are modeled simultaneously as well using spectrum synthesis with a
time-resolved model of the atmosphere over the observatory. The free parameters
in the complete model are the wavelength scale of the spectrum, the
instrumental profile, adjustments to the water and methane abundances in the
atmospheric model, telluric spectrum Doppler shift, and stellar Doppler shift.
Tests of the method based on the analysis of hundreds of spectra obtained for
late M dwarfs over six months demonstrate that precisions of ~5 m/s are
obtainable over long timescales, and precisions of better than 3 m/s can be
obtained over timescales up to a week. The obtained precision is comparable to
the predicted photon-limited errors, but primarily limited over long timescales
by the imperfect modeling of the telluric lines.

reports on the first study of Mrk841 soft X-ray spectrum at high spectral

absorption and emission spectral features in the soft X-ray band.The three
combined exposures obtained in January 2001 and the two obtained in January and
July 2005 were analysed using the SPEX software. We detect a two-phase warm
absorber: a medium ionisation component (logxi~1.5-2.2 ergs s cm^{-1}) is
responsible for a deep absorption feature in the Unresolved Transition Array of
the Fe M-shell and for several absorption lines in the OVI-VIII band; a higher
ionisation phase with logxi~3 ergs s cm^{-1} is required to fit absorption in
the NeIX-X band. The ionisation state and the column density of the gas present
moderate variation from 2001 to 2005 for both phases. The high ionisation
component of the warm absorber has no effect in the Fe K band. No significant
velocity shift of the absorption lines is measured in the RGS data. Remarkably,
the 2005 spectra show emission features consistent with photoionisation in a
high density (n_e>10^{11} cm^{-3}) gas: a prominent OVII line triplet is
clearly observed in January 2005 and narrow Radiative Recombination Continua

show a deficit of hot evolved stars with respect to observations. We
investigate quantitatively the impact of such modelling inaccuracies on the
significance of star formation history reconstructions obtained from optical
integrated spectra. To do so, we analyse the sample of spectra of galactic
globular clusters of Schiavon et al. with STECKMAP (Ocvirk et al.) and the
stellar population models Vazdekis et al. and Bruzual & Charlot, and focus on
the reconstructed stellar age distributions. Firstly, we show that
background/foreground contamination correlates with E(B-V), which allows us to
define a clean subsample of uncontaminated GCs, on the basis of a E(B-V)
filtering.
  We then identify a ""confusion zone"" where fake young bursts of star formation
pop up in the star formation history although the observed population is
genuinely old. These artifacts appear for 70-100% of cases depending on the
population model used, and contribute up to 12% of the light in the optical.
Their correlation with the horizontal branch ratio indicates that the confusion
is driven by HB morphology: red horizontal branch clusters are well fitted by
old stellar population models while those with a blue HB require an additional
hot component. The confusion zone extends over [Fe/H]=[-2,-1.2], although we
lack the data to probe extreme high and low metallicity regimes. As a
consequence, any young starburst superimposed on an old stellar population in
this metallicity range could be regarded as a modeling artifact, if it weighs
less than 12% of the optical light, and if no emission lines typical of an HII
region are present.

transition is of first order. At the transition point, the energy spectrum
reveals certain degeneracy indicative of an emergent SU(2) symmetry. With an

of self-gravity wakes in Saturn's rings, describing their properties by means
of only 6 numbers: 3 optical depths and 3 weighting factors. These numbers are
obtained using a density-estimation procedure that finds the frequencies of
various values of local density within a simulated ring patch.
  Application of our parameterization to a suite of N-body simulations implies
that the distribution of local optical depths is trimodal, rather than bimodal
as previous authors have assumed. Rings dominated by self-gravity wakes appear
to be mostly empty space.
  The implications of this result for the analysis of occultation data are more
conceptual than practical. The only adjustment needed is that the model
parameter $\tau_{gap}$ should be interpreted as representing the area-weighted
average optical depth within the gaps (or inter-wake regions).
  The most significant consequence of our results applies to the question of
why ""propeller"" structures observed in the mid-A ring are seen as
relative-bright features, even though the most prominent features of simulated
propellers are regions of relatively low density. We find preliminary
quantitative support for the hypothesis that propellers would be bright if they
involve a local and temporary disruption of self-gravity wakes, flooding the
region with more ""photometrically active"" material (i.e., material that can
contribute to the rings' local optical depth) even though the overall density
is lower, and thus raising their apparent brightnesses in agreement with
observations. We suggest that this mechanism be tested by future detailed

molecules in the J=1 electro-vibrational ground state, where a free-ground
laser couples atoms directly to the ground state and a free-bound laser couples
the atoms to an electronically-excited state. This problem raises an interest
because heteronuclear photoassociation from atoms to near-ground state
molecules is limited by the small size of the target state. Nevertheless, the
addition of the excited state creates a second pathway for creating ground
state molecules, leading to quantum interference between direct
photoassociation and photoassociation via the excited molecular state, as well
as a dispersive-like shift of the free-ground resonance position. Using LiNa as
an example, these results are shown to depend on the detuning and intensity of
the free-bound laser, as well as the semi-classical size of both molecular
states. Despite strong enhancement, coherent conversion to the LiNa
electro-vibrational ground state is possible only in a limited regime near the
free-bound resonance.

violating background k-essence field. We first look into the effect that
k-essence has on the neutrino dispersion relation and derive a general formula
for the neutrino velocity in the presence on a k-essence background. The
influence of k-essence coupling on neutrino oscillations is then considered. It
is found that a non-diagonal k-essence coupling leads to an oscillation length
that goes like \lambda \sim E^{-1} where E is the energy. This should be
contrasted with the \lambda \sim E dependence seen in the standard mass-induced
mechanism of neutrino oscillations. While such a scenario is not favored
experimentally, it places constraints on the interactions of the neutrino with
a cosmological k-essence scalar background by requiring it to be flavor
diagonal. All non-trivial physical effects discussed here require the speed of
sound to be different from the speed of light and hence are primarily a
consequence of Lorentz violation.

existing and future observations of exoplanets, both gas giant and terrestrial.
Given the paucity of data on exoplanet atmospheres, our approach is to
emphasize fundamental principles and insights gained from Solar-System studies
that are likely to be generalizable to exoplanets. We begin by presenting the
hierarchy of basic equations used in atmospheric dynamics, including the
Navier-Stokes, primitive, shallow-water, and two-dimensional nondivergent
models. We then survey key concepts in atmospheric dynamics, including the
importance of planetary rotation, the concept of balance, and scaling arguments
to show how turbulent interactions generally produce large-scale east-west
banding on rotating planets. We next turn to issues specific to giant planets,
including their expected interior and atmospheric thermal structures, the
implications for their wind patterns, and mechanisms to pump their east-west
jets. Hot Jupiter atmospheric dynamics are given particular attention, as these
close-in planets have been the subject of most of the concrete developments in
the study of exoplanetary atmospheres. We then turn to the basic elements of
circulation on terrestrial planets as inferred from Solar-System studies,
including Hadley cells, jet streams, processes that govern the large-scale
horizontal temperature contrasts, and climate, and we discuss how these
insights may apply to terrestrial exoplanets. Although exoplanets surely
possess a greater diversity of circulation regimes than seen on the planets in
our Solar System, our guiding philosophy is that the multi-decade study of
Solar-System planets reviewed here provides a foundation upon which our
understanding of more exotic exoplanetary meteorology must build.

decay rates $t^{-4}$, and $t^{-6}$, respectively. We proceed by decomposition
into angular momentum $\ell$ and summation of the decay estimates on the
Regge-Wheeler equation for fixed $\ell$. We encounter a dichotomy: the decay
law in time is entirely determined by the asymptotic behavior of the
Regge-Wheeler potential in the far field, whereas the growth of the constants
in $\ell$ is dictated by the behavior of the Regge-Wheeler potential in a small
neighborhood around its maximum. In other words, the tails are controlled by
small energies, whereas the number of angular derivatives needed on the data is
determined by energies close to the top of the Regge-Wheeler potential. This
dichotomy corresponds to the well-known principle that for initial times the
decay reflects the presence of complex resonances generated by the potential
maximum, whereas for later times the tails are determined by the far field.
However, we do not invoke complex resonances at all, but rely instead on
semiclassical Sigal-Soffer type propagation estimates based on a Mourre bound
near the top energy.

plane sliding involving the formation of stacking faults as the most favourable

Dominant slip planes define the lattice preferred orientation and elastic

obeys any rules and what these rules are. To answer this and related questions
we use several tools: (i)Reduced energy surface and its density of states, (ii)
descriptor of structure called fingerprint function, which can be represented
as a one-dimensional function or a vector in abstract multidimensional space,
(iii) definition of a ''distance'' between two structures enabling
quantification of energy landscapes, (iv) definition of a degree of order of a
structure, and (v) definitions of the quasi-entropy quantifying structural
diversity. Our approach can be used for rationalizing large databases of
crystal structures and for tuning computational algorithms for structure
prediction. It enables quantitative and intuitive representations of energy
landscapes and reappraisal of some of the traditional chemical notions and
rules. Our analysis confirms the expectations that low-energy minima are
clustered in compact regions of configuration space (""funnels"") and that
chemical systems tend to have very few funnels, sometimes only one. This
analysis can be applied to the physical properties of solids, opening new ways
of discovering structure-property relations. We quantitatively demonstrate that
crystals tend to adopt one of the few simplest structures consistent with their
chemistry, providing a thermodynamic justification of Pauling's fifth rule.

Intuitively, this response is expected to be accompanied by an increase in the
widths of the valence and conduction bands and hence a more pronounced
free-electron-like behaviour. But at the densities that can now be achieved
experimentally, compression can be so substantial that core electrons overlap.
This effect dramatically alters electronic properties from those typically
associated with simple free-electron metals such as lithium and sodium, leading
in turn to structurally complex phases and superconductivity with a high
critical temperature. But the most intriguing prediction - that the seemingly
simple metals Li and Na will transform under pressure into insulating states,
owing to pairing of alkali atoms - has yet to be experimentally confirmed. Here
we report experimental observations of a pressure-induced transformation of Na
into an optically transparent phase at 200 GPa (corresponding to 5.0-fold
compression). Experimental and computational data identify the new phase as a
wide bandgap dielectric with a six-coordinated, highly distorted
double-hexagonal close-packed structure. We attribute the emergence of this
dense insulating state not to atom pairing, but to p-d hybridizations of
valence electrons and their repulsion by core electrons into the lattice
interstices. We expect that such insulating states may also form in other
elements and compounds when compression is sufficiently strong that atomic
cores start to overlap strongly.

Controversies have
shrouded this element since its discovery was announced in 1808: the new
'element' turned out to be a compound containing less than 60-70 percent of
boron, and it was not until 1909 that 99-percent pure boron was obtained. And
although we now know of at least 16 polymorphs, the stable phase of boron is
not yet experimentally established even at ambient conditions. Boron's
complexities arise from frustration: situated between metals and insulators in
the periodic table, boron has only three valence electrons, which would favour
metallicity, but they are sufficiently localized that insulating states emerge.
However, this subtle balance between metallic and insulating states is easily
shifted by pressure, temperature and impurities. Here we report the results of
high-pressure experiments and ab initio evolutionary crystal structure
predictions that explore the structural stability of boron under pressure and,
strikingly, reveal a partially ionic high-pressure boron phase. This new phase
is stable between 19 and 89 GPa, can be quenched to ambient conditions, and has
a hitherto unknown structure (space group Pnnm, 28 atoms in the unit cell)
consisting of icosahedral B12 clusters and B2 pairs in a NaCl-type arrangement.
We find that the ionicity of the phase affects its electronic bandgap, infrared
adsorption and dielectric constants, and that it arises from the different
electronic properties of the B2 pairs and B12 clusters and the resultant charge
transfer between them.

distributed network. Given bandwidth constraints, the goal is to minimize the
number of rounds required to obtain a random walk sample. We first present a
fast sublinear time distributed algorithm for performing random walks whose
time complexity is sublinear in the length of the walk. Our algorithm performs
a random walk of length $\ell$ in $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\ell D})$ rounds (with high
probability) on an undirected network, where $D$ is the diameter of the
network. This improves over the previous best algorithm that ran in
$\tilde{O}(\ell^{2/3}D^{1/3})$ rounds (Das Sarma et al., PODC 2009). We further
extend our algorithms to efficiently perform $k$ independent random walks in
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{k\ell D} + k)$ rounds. We then show that there is a
fundamental difficulty in improving the dependence on $\ell$ any further by
proving a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{\frac{\ell}{\log \ell}} + D)$ under a
general model of distributed random walk algorithms. Our random walk algorithms
are useful in speeding up distributed algorithms for a variety of applications
that use random walks as a subroutine. We present two main applications. First,
we give a fast distributed algorithm for computing a random spanning tree (RST)

rounds (with high probability; here $m$ is the number of edges). Our second
application is a fast decentralized algorithm for estimating mixing time and
related parameters of the underlying network. Our algorithm is fully

cosmology. The bounce is realized as a consequence of higher order spatial

linear cosmological perturbations in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity coupled to
matter in the case when spatial curvature is present. As in the case without
spatial curvature, we find that there is no extra dynamical degree of freedom
for scalar metric perturbations. We study the evolution of fluctuations through
the bounce and show that the solutions remain non-singular throughout. If we
start with quantum vacuum fluctuations on sub-Hubble scales in the contracting
phase, and if the contracting phase is dominated by pressure-less matter, then
for $\lambda = 1$ and in the infrared limit the perturbations at late times are
scale invariant. Thus, Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity can provide a realization of
the ``matter bounce'' scenario of structure formation.

describing evolution by completely positive trace preserving (CPTP) quantum
operations can fail and non-completely positive (non-CP) maps may be observed.
  A new classification of correlations between a system and environment using
quantum discord is explored. However, we find quantum discord is not a
symmetric quantity between exchange of systems and this leads to ambiguity in
classifications - states which are both quantum and classically correlated
depending on the order of the two systems.
  State preparation in quantum process tomography is investigated with regard
to non-CP maps. In SQPT the preparation procedure can influence the
complete-positivity of the reconstructed quantum operation if our system is
initially correlated with an environment. We examine a recently proposed
preparation procedures using projective measurements, and propose our own
protocol that uses a single measurement followed by unitary rotations. The
former can give rise to non-CP evolution while the later will always give rise
to a CP map. State preparation in AAPT was found always to give rise to CP
evolution.
  We examine the effect of statistical noise in process tomography and find it
can result in the identification of a non-CP when the evolution should be CP.
The variance of the distribution for reconstructed processes is found to be
inversely proportional to the number of copies of a state used to perform
tomography. Finally, we detail an experiment using currently available linear
optics QC devices to demonstrate non-CP maps arising in SQPT.

minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation in Gaussian noise via its relation
to the mutual information (the I-MMSE relation), here we propose a simple and
more direct relationship between optimum estimation and certain information
measures (e.g., the information density and the Fisher information), which can
be viewed as partition functions and hence are amenable to analysis using
statistical--mechanical techniques. The proposed approach has several
advantages, most notably, its applicability to general sources and channels, as
opposed to the I-MMSE relation and its variants which hold only for certain
classes of channels (e.g., additive white Gaussian noise channels). We then
demonstrate the derivation of the conditional mean estimator and the MMSE in a
few examples. Two of these examples turn out to be generalizable to a fairly
wide class of sources and channels. For this class, the proposed approach is
shown to yield an approximate conditional mean estimator and an MMSE formula
that has the flavor of a single-letter expression. We also show how our
approach can easily be generalized to situations of mismatched estimation.

broadening may be explained by the local distortions induced by the K
substitution. Extra phonon modes are observed around the wave vector q =

using a biomimetic sensor which suggest that fingerprints (epidermal ridges)
may play an important role in shaping the subcutaneous stress vibrations in a
way which facilitates their processing by the PC channel. Here we further test
this hypothesis by directly recording the modulations of the

As an example, the dielectric permittivity of the Drude model is considered and
its time-dependent counterpart is derived and analyzed. The respective electric
displacement cannot be represented in terms of the standard Fourier integral.
The regularization procedure allowing to circumvent these difficulties is
suggested. For purpose of comparison it is shown that the frequency-dependent
dielectric permittivity of insulators satisfies all rigorous mathematical
criteria. This permits us to conclude that in the presence of free charge
carriers the concept of dielectric permittivity is not as well defined as for
insulators and we make a link to widely discussed puzzles in the theory of

permittivities.

matters, which decays into visible particles through dimension six operators
suppressed by the grand unification scale. Under certain conditions, S decays
dominantly into a pair of sleptons with universal coupling for all generations.
Subsequently, electrons and positrons are produced from cascade decays of these
sleptons. These cascade decay chains smooth the electron/positron spectrum,
which permit naturally a good fit to the Fermi LAT data. The observed positron
fraction upturn by PAMELA can be reproduced simultaneously. We have also
calculated diffuse gamma-ray spectra due to the electron/positron excesses and
compared them with the preliminary Fermi LAT data from 0.1 GeV to 10 GeV in the

proportional to the surface gravity of the black hole as occurs in usual
Einstein gravity. The entropy is also derived by using the first law of black
hole thermodynamics. Finally, the spectrum of entropy/area is obtained. The

origin. The weak point of this method is that subjective judgment plays a
relevant role.
  Recently we proposed an automated method that avoids the subjectivity, whose

doesn't require a specific linguistic knowledge. Moreover, the method allows a
quick comparison of a large number of languages.
  We applied our method to the Indo-European and Austronesian families,

similar to those of previous studies, but with some important differences in
the position of few languages and subgroups. We believe that these differences

of disc dominated data using RXTE spectra from the three most recent outbursts.
We use the best current models for the disc emission, including full radiative
transfer through the photosphere rather than assuming that the intrinsic
emission from each radius has a (colour temperature corrected) blackbody
spectrum. The results strongly depend on the poorly known binary system
parameters, but we find a strict upper limit of a<0.9 for any distance greater
than 6 kpc, assuming that the orbital inclination is the same as that of the
inner disc. By contrast, the higher spin of 0.935 +/- 0.01 (statistical)
+/-0.01 (systematic) claimed from fitting the iron line profile in this object
requires that the inner disc is misaligned by over 20 degrees from the orbital
inclination. While some of these datasets are distorted by instrumental pileup,
the same spin/inclination constraints are derived from data which are not piled
up, so there is a real conflict between the two techniques to measure spin. We
argue that the disc spectral fits are more likely to be robust hence that there
are still issues to be understood in the iron line profile.

numbers. Most algorithms relative to these systems only use this fact to select
vertices.
  For infinite state systems, however, the situation is different: in
particular, for such systems having a finite description, each state of the
system is a configuration of some machine. Then most algorithmic approaches
rely on the structure of these configurations. Such characterisations are said
internal. In order to apply algorithms detecting a structural property (like
identifying connected components) one may have first to transform the system in
order to fit the description needed for the algorithm. The problem of internal
characterisation is that it hides structural properties, and each solution
becomes ad hoc relatively to the form of the configurations.
  On the contrary, external characterisations avoid explicit naming of the
vertices. Such characterisation are mostly defined via graph transformations.
  In this paper we present two kind of external characterisations:
deterministic graph rewriting, which in turn characterise regular graphs,
deterministic context-free languages, and rational graphs. Inverse substitution
from a generator (like the complete binary tree) provides characterisation for
prefix-recognizable graphs, the Caucal Hierarchy and rational graphs. We
illustrate how these characterisation provide an efficient tool for the
representation of infinite state systems.

Astrolabe from 1826 to1829 and, in his work about the geographical division of
the Pacific, he proposed a method to measure the degree of relation among
languages. The method used by modern glottochronology, developed by Morris
Swadesh in the 1950s (Swadesh 1952), measures distances from the percentage of
shared cognates, which are words with a common historical origin. Recently, we
proposed a new automated method which uses normalized Levenshtein distance
among words with the same meaning and averages on the words contained in a
list. Another classical problem in glottochronology is the study of the
stability of words corresponding to different meanings. Words, in fact, evolve
because of lexical changes, borrowings and replacement at a rate which is not
the same for all of them. The speed of lexical evolution is different for
different meanings and it is probably related to the frequency of use of the
associated words (Pagel et al. 2007). This problem is tackled here by an
automated methodology only based on normalized Levenshtein distance.

particular, not only for being extremely complex information processing models,
but also because of a computational expensive learning phase. The most popular
training method for these models is back-propagation through the structure.
This algorithm has been revealed not to be the most appropriate for structured
processing due to problems of convergence, while more sophisticated training
methods enhance the speed of convergence at the expense of increasing
significantly the computational cost. In this paper, we firstly perform an
analysis of the underlying principles behind these models aimed at
understanding their computational power. Secondly, we propose an approximate
second order stochastic learning algorithm. The proposed algorithm dynamically
adapts the learning rate throughout the training phase of the network without
incurring excessively expensive computational effort. The algorithm operates in
both on-line and batch modes. Furthermore, the resulting learning scheme is
robust against the vanishing gradients problem. The advantages of the proposed

<M_SL/M_X>=1.3 at 3 sigma significance -- clusters with larger substructure
fractions displaying greater mass discrepancies, and thus greater departures
from hydrostatic equilibrium; (iii) cluster substructure fraction is also
correlated with the slope of the gas density profile on small scales, implying
a connection between cluster-cluster mergers and gas cooling. Overall our
results are consistent with the view that cluster-cluster mergers play a
prominent role in shaping the properties of cluster cores, in particular
causing departures from hydrostatic equilibrium, and possibly disturbing cool
cores. Our results do not support recent claims that large Einstein radius
clusters present a challenge to the CDM paradigm.

are investigated in the pyrite system NiS_{2-x}Se_x under pressure using
density functional theory (DFT). We test several approximations, including the
generalized gradient approximation (GGA), the GGA+U approach, and hybrid
functionals. In addition we apply the GW approximation and perform Hartree-Fock
calculations. The important role of the chalcogen dimers in the electronic
structure is discussed within GGA, which sufficiently describes the role of the
lattice in the metal-insulator transition. In addition, the magnetic phase
diagram is determined. However, the electronic properties are inadequately
described -- the insulating ground state of NiS_2 cannot be obtained -- and the
magnetic order is slightly overestimated. If correlations are taken into
account within GGA+U, the insulator is found, but the non-magnetic ground state
of the doped samples is not accessible. Mixing Fock exchange with local
approximations as GGA correctly reproduce the insulating ground state in NiS_2,
and metallic ground states with doping and pressure. The insulator is -- in
contrast to earlier suggestions -- of Mott type, i. e. the gap opens between Ni
3d {eg} states. Due to the Fock term, the magnetic order is strongly
overestimated. The applied GW calculations are not able to correct the metallic
character of NiS_2 and underestimate the gap by one order of magnitude.

surface flows by determining the horizontal scale dependence of the velocity
and intensity fields, as represented by their power spectra, and to offer some
theoretical guidelines to interpret these spectra. We use long time series of
images taken by SOT/Hinode and reconstruct both horizontal (by granule
tracking) and vertical (by Doppler effect) velocity fields in a field of view
75x75Mm^2. At small sub-granulation scales, the kinetic energy spectral density
associated with vertical motions exhibits a k^{-10/3}-like spectrum, while the
intensity fluctuation spectrum follows a k^{-3} or k^{-17/3}-like spectrum at
the two continuum levels investigated (525 and 450 nm respectively). We discuss
the physical origin of these scalings and argue that they provide a direct
observational signature of buoyancy-driven turbulent dynamics in a strongly
thermally diffusive regime. In the mesogranulation range and up to a scale of
25Mm, we find that the vertical velocity field amplitude decreases like
L^{-3/2} with the horizontal scale L. This behaviour corresponds to a k^2
spectral power law. Still in the mesoscale range, [2.5, 10]Mm, we find that
intensity fluctuations in the blue continuum follow a power law in k^2. We show
that granule tracking cannot sample scales below 2.5Mm. We locate the
supergranulation energy peak around 30Mm and show that the emergence of a pore
erases this spectral peak. Thanks to a scale height estimate, we find that
supergranular flows are shallow. (abridged abstract).

compared the fraction of stars showing ongoing accretion (f_acc) to the
fraction of stars with near-to-mid infrared excess (f_IRAC). In most cases we
find f_acc < f_IRAC, i.e., mass accretion appears to cease (or drop below
detectable level) earlier than the dust is dissipated in the inner disk. At 5
Myr, 95% of the stellar population has stopped accreting material at a rate of
> 10^{-11} Msun yr-1, while ~20% of the stars show near-infrared excess

quenched in its miscibility gap is nucleation and growth, its homogeneous phase
reaching a metastable equilibrium state. The successive stages of growth of the
nucleated droplets are a diffusion-driven free growth, an intermediate regime
and a coarsening by reduction of interface (Ostwald ripening or Brownian
collisions induced coalescence). We have made light attenuation experiments to
investigate the sedimentation in such systems. These results have given us
access experimentally to two values predicted theoretically: the growth
exponent of the intermediate regime and the crossover time between this regime
and interface-reduction coarsening. These data, added to the literature
results, have permitted to get a quite complete view of the growth scenario in
very off-critical phase-separating liquids.

from the systemic redshift of z=2.043. Of particular interest is the lowest
velocity system that displays absorption from low-ionization species such as Mg
II, Al II, Si II, Si II*, Fe II and Fe II*. Accurate column densities were
measured for all transitions in this lowest velocity BAL using an inhomogeneous
absorber model. The ratio of column densities of Si II* and Fe II* with respect
to their ground states gave an electron number density of log n_e (cm^-3) =
3.75 +/- 0.22 for the outflow. Photoionization modeling with careful regards to
chemical abundances and the incident spectral energy distribution predicts an
ionization parameter of log U_H = -1.93 +/- 0.21 and a hydrogen column density
of log N_H (cm^-2) = 20.80 +/- 0.28. This places the outflow at 3.3+1.5-1.0 kpc
from the central AGN. Assuming that the fraction of solid angle subtended by
the outflow is 0.2, these values yield a kinetic luminosity of (4.5+3.1-1.8) x
