PPB-BETS all suggest the need for a new primary source of electrons and
positrons at high (>~100 GeV) energies. Many proposals have been put forth to
explain these data, usually relying on a single particle to annihilate or decay
to produce e+e-. In this paper, we consider models with multiple species of
WIMPs with significantly different masses. We show if such dark matter
candidates chi_i annihilate into light bosons, they naturally produce equal
annihilation rates, even as the available numbers of pairs for annihilation
n_chi_i^2 differ by orders of magnitude. We argue that a consequence of these
models can be to add additional signal naturally at lower (~100 GeV) versus
higher (~ TeV) energies, changing the expected spectrum and even adding bumps
at lower energies, which may alleviate some of the tension in the required
annihilation rates between PAMELA and Fermi. These spectral changes may yield
observable consequences in the microwave Haze signal observed at the upcoming
Planck satellite. Such a model can connect to other observable signals such as
DAMA and INTEGRAL by having the lighter (heavier) state be a pseudo-Dirac
fermion with splitting 100 keV (1 MeV). We show that variations in the halo
velocity dispersion can alleviate constraints from final state radiation in the
galactic center and galactic ridge. If the lighter WIMP has a large
self-interaction cross section, the light-WIMP halo might collapse,
dramatically altering expectations for direct and indirect detection
signatures.

spectral energy distributions on wide frequency ranges minimizing the effects
due to source variability. POFF is a combination of IDL routines which combine
the publicly available information about the Planck scanning strategy and focal
plane shape in order to identify if a given (list of) position(s) can be
observable by the satellite at a given frequency and/or by selected receivers
in a given time range. The output can be displayed with the desired time
resolution and selecting among various sorting options. The code is not a

successfully used to plan activities within the Planck collaboration, including

functions of the spin-half square- and triangular-lattice antiferromagnets by
using the LSUB$m$ approximation. We show that the absolute values of the
spin-spin correlation functions $| < \bf{s}(0).\bf{s}(r) > |$ converge with
increasing approximation level for both lattices. We believe that the LSUB$m$
approximation provides reasonable results for the correlation functions for
lattice separations roughly of order $r \approx m$ for the square lattice. We
compare qualitatively our results for the square lattice to those results of
quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and we see that good correspondence is observed.
Indeed as seen by QMC, the spin-spin correlation function initially decays
strongly with $|r|$ before becoming constant for larger values of $|r|$. CCM
results are also compared to results of exact diagonalisations for both
lattices. ED results demonstrate a strong finite-size effects at lattice
separations $r=L/2$ (where $N=L \times L$) for both lattices. The behaviour of
the correlation function for the triangular lattice is qualitatively similar to
that of the square lattice, namely, that it decays strongly at first before
becoming constant. This is in keeping with the behaviour of both models, which
are believed strongly to be N\'eel-ordered from approximate studies.

to develop recently. We show that, given a single use of certain classical
channels, entangled states of a system shared by the sender and receiver can be
used to increase the number of (classical) messages which can be sent with no
chance of error. In particular, we show how to construct such a channel based
on any proof of the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem. This is a new example of the
use of quantum effects to improve the performance of a classical task. We
investigate the connection between this phenomenon and that of
``pseudo-telepathy'' games. The use of generalised non-signalling correlations
to assist in this task is also considered. In this case, a particularly elegant
theory results and, remarkably, it is sometimes possible to transmit
information with zero-error using a channel with no unassisted zero-error
capacity.

computation for cell adaptation and surveillance. In these webs, a set of
causal relations is built up from thousands of interactions between
transcription factors and their target genes. The large size of these webs and
their entangled nature make difficult to achieve a global view of their
internal organisation. Here, this problem has been addressed through a
comparative study for {\em Escherichia coli}, {\em Bacillus subtilis} and {\em
Saccharomyces cerevisiae} gene regulatory networks. We extract the minimal core
of causal relations, uncovering the hierarchical and modular organisation from
a novel dynamical/causal perspective. Our results reveal a marked top-down
hierarchy containing several small dynamical modules for \textit{E. coli} and
\textit{B. subtilis}. Conversely, the yeast network displays a single but large
dynamical module in the middle of a bow-tie structure. We found that these
dynamical modules capture the relevant wiring among both common and
organism-specific biological functions such as transcription initiation,
metabolic control, signal transduction, response to stress, sporulation and
cell cycle. Functional and topological results suggest that two fundamentally
different forms of logic organisation may have evolved in bacteria and yeast.

context of the asteroseismic modelling of these stars. While red giants exhibit
low surface rotational velocities, we find that the rotational history of the
star has a large impact on its properties during the red giant phase. In
particular, for stars massive enough to ignite He burning in non-degenerate
conditions, rotational mixing induces a significant increase of the stellar
luminosity and shifts the location of the core helium burning phase to a higher
luminosity in the HR diagram. This of course results in a change of the seismic
properties of red giants at the same evolutionary state. As a consequence the
inclusion of rotation significantly changes the fundamental parameters of a red
giant star as determined by performing an asteroseismic calibration. In
particular rotation decreases the derived stellar mass and increases the age.
Depending on the rotation law assumed in the convective envelope and on the
initial velocity of the star, non-negligible values of rotational splitting can
be reached, which may complicate the observation and identification of
non-radial oscillation modes for red giants exhibiting moderate surface
rotational velocities. By comparing the effects of rotation and overshooting,
we find that the main-sequence widening and the increase of the H-burning
lifetime induced by rotation (Vini=150 km/s) are well reproduced by
non-rotating models with an overshooting parameter of 0.1, while the increase
of luminosity during the post-main sequence evolution is better reproduced by
non-rotating models with overshooting parameters twice as large. This is due to
the fact that rotation not only increases the size of the convective core but
also changes the chemical composition of the radiative zone.

Recent experiments suggest that some morphogen gradients may be interpreted

systems will be more robust to embryo-to-embryo fluctuations. By analysing two
experimentally motivated models of morphogen gradient formation, we investigate
the positional precision of gene expression boundaries determined by
pre-steady-state morphogen gradients in the presence of embryo-to-embryo
fluctuations, internal biochemical noise and variations in the timing of
morphogen measurement. Morphogens that are direct transcription factors are
found to be particularly sensitive to internal noise when interpreted prior to
steady-state, disadvantaging early measurement, even in the presence of large
embryo-to-embryo fluctuations. Morphogens interpreted by cell-surface receptors
can be measured prior to steady-state without significant decrease in
positional precision provided fluctuations in the timing of measurement are
small. Applying our results to experiment, we predict that Bicoid, a
transcription factor morphogen in Drosophila, is unlikely to be interpreted
prior to reaching steady-state. We also predict that Activin in Xenopus and
Nodal in zebrafish, morphogens interpreted by cell-surface receptors, can be

properties. We obtain a reduced stochastic master equation describing this
measurement and its effect on the qubits. As an example, we present results
showing parity measurements of two qubits. In this situation, measurement of an
initially unentangled state can yield with near unit probability a state of
significant concurrence.

spectra are believed to be produced by intervening galaxies. However, the
connection of quasar absorbers to galaxies is not well-understood, since
attempts to image the absorbing galaxies have often failed. While most DLAs
appear to be metal-poor, a population of metal-rich absorbers, mostly sub-DLAs,
has been discovered in recent studies. Here we report high-resolution K-band
imaging with the Keck Laser Guide Star Adaptive Optics (LGSAO) system of the
field of quasar SDSSJ1323-0021 in search of the galaxy producing the z = 0.72
sub-DLA absorber. With a metallicity of 2-4 times the solar level, this
absorber is of the most metal-rich systems found to date. Our data show a large
bright galaxy with an angular separation of only 1.25"" from the quasar,
well-resolved from the quasar at the high resolution of our data. The galaxy
has a magnitude of K = 17.6-17.9, which corresponds to a luminosity of ~ 3-6
L*. Morphologically, the galaxy is fit with a model with an effective radius,
enclosing half the total light, of R_e = 4 kpc and a bulge-to-total ratio of
0.4-1.0, indicating a substantial bulge stellar population. Based on the
mass-metallicity relation of nearby galaxies, the absorber galaxy appears to
have a stellar mass > 10^{11} M_sun. Given the small impact parameter, this
massive galaxy appears to be responsible for the metal-rich sub-DLA. The
absorber galaxy is consistent with the metallicity-luminosity relation observed
for nearby galaxies, but is near the upper end of metallicity. Our study marks
the first application of LGSAO for study of structure of galaxies producing
distant quasar absorbers. Finally, this study offers the first example of a
massive galaxy with a substantial bulge producing a metal-rich absorber.

theoretical framework which intuitively should be a an extremely effective
description of the quantum nature of matter when propagating on a given
background spacetime. If one wants to take care of backreaction effects, then a
theory of quantum gravity is needed. It is now widely believed that such a
theory should be formulated in a non-perturbative and therefore background
independent fashion. Hence, it is a priori a puzzle how a background dependent
QFT on CS should emerge as a semiclassical limit out of a background
independent quantum gravity theory. In this article we point out that the
Born-Oppenheimer decomposition (BOD) of the Hilbert space is ideally suited in
order to establish such a link, provided that the Hilbert space representation
of the gravitational field algebra satisfies an important condition. If the
condition is satisfied, then the framework of QFT on CS can be, in a certain
sense, embedded into a theory of quantum gravity. The unique representation of
the holonomy-flux algebra underlying Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) violates that
condition. While it is conceivable that the condition on the representation can
be relaxed, for convenience in this article we consider a new classical
gravitational field algebra and a Hilbert space representation of its
restriction to an algebraic graph for which the condition is satisfied. An
important question that remains and for which we have only partial answers is
how to construct eigenstates of the full gravity-matter Hamiltonian whose BOD
is confined to a small neighbourhood of a physically interesting vacuum
spacetime.

the environments of galaxies and their relation to the assembly of their host

indications that the local galaxy density is the most efficient parameter to
separate galaxy populations, but we also find that galaxies at fixed local
density show some remaining variation of their properties as a function of the
distance to the nearest cluster of galaxies (in a range of 0 to 10 cluster
virial radii). These differences seem to become less significant if the galaxy
samples are additionally constrained to be hosted by groups of similar total
luminosity. (ii) In AGN host galaxies, the morphology-density relation is much
less noticeable when compared to the behaviour of the full SDSS sample. In
order to interpret this result we analyse control samples constructed using
galaxies with no detected AGN activity with matching distributions of
redshifts, stellar masses, r-band luminosities, g-r colours, concentrations,
local densities, host group luminosities, and fractions of central and
satellite galaxies. The control samples also show a similar small dependence on
the local density indicating an influence from the AGN selection, but their
colours are slightly bluer compared to the AGN hosts regardless of local
density. Furthermore, even when the local density is held fixed at intermediate

(Extremely Red Objects, EROs), including their apparent division into passive
and obscured active objects with roughly similar number densities, are a known
challenge for models of galaxy formation. We produce mock catalogues generated
by interfacing the predictions of the semi-analytical MORGANA model for the
evolution of galaxies in a Lambda-CDM cosmology with the spectro-photometric +
radiative transfer code GRASIL and Infrared (IR) template library to show that
the model correctly reproduces number counts, redshift distributions and active
fractions of R-K>5 sources. We test the robustness of our results against
different dust attenuations and, most importantly, against the inclusion of
TP-AGB stars in Simple Stellar Populations used to generate galaxy spectra, and
find that the inclusion of TP-AGBs has a relevant effect, in that it allows to
increase by a large factor the number of very red active objects at all color
cuts. We find that though the most passive and the most obscured active
galaxies have a higher probability of being selected as EROs, many EROs have
intermediate properties and the population does not show bimodality in specific
star formation rate (SSFR). We predict that deep observations in the Far-IR,
from 100 to 500 micron, are the most efficient way to constrain the SSFR of
these objects; we give predictions for future Herschel observations. Finally,
we test whether a simple evolutionary sequence for the formation of z=0 massive
galaxies, going through a sub-mm-bright phase and then a ERO phase, are typical
in this galaxy formation model. We find that this sequence holds for ~25 per
cent of z=0 massive galaxies, while the model typically shows a more complex

for which upper limits exist for blue galaxies at z~0.1, provide a window into
galaxy formation and evolution, and are also an important contaminant for
current and future weak lensing surveys. Measurements of these alignments at
intermediate redshifts (z~0.6) that are more relevant for cosmic shear
observations are very important for understanding the origin and redshift
evolution of these alignments, and for minimising their impact on weak lensing
measurements. We present the first such intermediate-redshift measurement for
blue galaxies, using galaxy shape measurements from SDSS and spectroscopic
redshifts from the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey. Our null detection allows us to
place upper limits on the contamination of weak lensing measurements by blue
galaxy intrinsic alignments that, for the first time, do not require
significant model-dependent extrapolation from the z~0.1 SDSS observations.
Also, combining the SDSS and WiggleZ constraints gives us a long redshift
baseline with which to constrain intrinsic alignment models and contamination
of the cosmic shear power spectrum. Assuming that the alignments can be
explained by linear alignment with the smoothed local density field, we find
that a measurement of \sigma_8 in a blue-galaxy dominated, CFHTLS-like survey
would be contaminated by at most +/-0.02 (95% confidence level, SDSS and
WiggleZ) or +/-0.03 (WiggleZ alone) due to intrinsic alignments. [Abridged]

  Comparison of relative abundances, [X/Fe], for some 15 elements with those of
the extremely metal-poor giants of the Galactic halo shows Boo-1137 is ""normal""
with respect to C and N, the odd-Z elements Na and Al, the Fe-peak elements,
and the n-capture elements Sr and Ba, in comparison with the bulk of the halo
with [Fe/H] < -3.0. The alpha- elements Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti are all higher by
Delta[X/Fe] ~ 0.2 than average halo values. Monte-Carlo analysis indicates
Delta[alpha/Fe] values this large are expected with probability ~ 0.02. The
abundance pattern in Boo-1137 suggests inhomogeneous chemical evolution,
consistent with the wide internal spread in Fe abundances we reported earlier.
The similarity of most of the Boo-1137 relative abundances with respect to halo
values, and the fact that the alpha-elements are all offset by a similar small
amount from the halo averages, points to the same underlying galaxy-scale
stellar initial mass function, but that Boo-1137 likely originated in a
star-forming region where the abundances reflect either poor mixing of
supernova (SN) ejecta, or poor sampling of the SN progenitor mass range, or
both.

investigate its structure and star formation history, and to search for signs
of association with the recently discovered Leo~V satellite. Based on
parameterized fits, we find that Leo~IV is round, with $\epsilon < 0.23$ (at
the 68\% confidence limit) and a half-light radius of $r_{h} \simeq 130$ pc.
Additionally, we perform a thorough search for extended structures in the plane
of the sky and along the line of sight. We derive our surface brightness
detection limit by implanting fake structures into our catalog with stellar
populations identical to that of Leo~IV. We show that we are sensitive to
stream-like structures with surface brightness $\mu_{r}\lesssim29.6$ mag
arcsec$^{-2}$, and at this limit, we find no stellar bridge between Leo IV (out
to a radius of $\sim$0.5 kpc) and the recently discovered, nearby satellite Leo
V. Using the color magnitude fitting package StarFISH, we determine that Leo~IV
is consistent with a single age ($\sim$14 Gyr), single metallicity
($[Fe/H]\sim-2.3$) stellar population, although we can not rule out a
significant spread in these value. We derive a luminosity of
$M_{V}=-5.5\pm0.3$. Studying both the spatial distribution and frequency of
Leo~IV's 'blue plume' stars reveals evidence for a young ($\sim$2 Gyr) stellar
population which makes up $\sim$2\% of its stellar mass. This sprinkling of
star formation, only detectable in this deep study, highlights the need for
further imaging of the new Milky Way satellites along with theoretical work on
the expected, detailed properties of these possible 'reionization fossils'.

clearly separated in the abundance of heavy elements as traced by Calcium,
suggesting that the type II supernovae enrichment is also responsible, in
addition to the pollutions of lighter elements by intermediate mass asymptotic
giant branch stars or fast-rotating massive stars. The RGB split, however, is

is a gaussian of the same intrinsic width, whose trajectory across the line

measure of v sin I. We show that even when v sin I is less than the width of
the intrinsic line profile, the travelling Doppler ""shadow"" cast by the planet
creates an identifiable distortion in the line profiles which is amenable to
direct modelling. Direct measurement of the trajectory of the missing starlight
yields self-consistent measures of the projected stellar rotation rate, the
intrinsic width of the mean local photospheric line profile, the projected
spin-orbit misalignment angle, and the system's centre-of-mass velocity.
Combined with the photometric rotation period, the results give a geometrical

manifest as nonlinear relations between the superconductivity phase difference

steps in dc cuurent-voltage (IV) characteristics of a Josephson junction under
microwave shining, which can be used as a voltage standard. Inversely, the
Josephson effects provide a unique way to generate high-frequency
electromagnetic (EM) radiation by dc bias voltage. The discovery of cuprate
high-Tc superconductors accelerated the effort to develop novel source of EM
waves based on a stack of atomically dense-packed intrinsic Josephson junctions
(IJJs), since the large superconductivity gap covers the whole terahertz
frequency band. Very recently, strong and coherent terahertz radiations have
been successfully generated from a mesa structure of
$\rm{Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_{8+\delta}}$ single crystal which works both as the source
of energy gain and as the cavity for resonance. It is then found theoretically
that, due to huge inductive coupling of IJJs produced by the nanometer junction
separation and the large London penetration depth of order of $\rm{\mu m}$ of
the material, a novel dynamic state is stabilized in the coupled sine-Gordon
system, in which $\pm \pi$ kinks in phase differences are developed responding
to the standing wave of Josephson plasma and are stacked alternatively in the
c-axis. This novel solution of the inductively coupled sine-Gordon equations
captures the important features of experimental observations. The theory
predicts an optimal radiation power larger than the one available to date by
orders of magnitude, and thus suggests the technological relevance of the
phenomena.

the Rand index, a well known segmentation performance measure. The Rand index
measures segmentation performance by quantifying the classification of the
connectivity of image pixel pairs after segmentation. By using the simple graph
partitioning algorithm of finding the connected components of the thresholded

thickening does not. We prove similar results for thickenings which commute
only with integer shifts and in the discrete and multi-dimensional settings.
This answers 3 questions of Holroyd, Lyons and Soo.
  We briefly consider also a much more general setup in which we ask for the
existence of a deterministic coupling satisfying a relation between two
probability measures. We present a conjectured sufficient condition for the
existence of such couplings.

optionally allows even for statistics obtained by under-sampling the received

  All performance measures are given as a function of the chip waveform and the
delay distribution of the users in the large system limit. It turns out that
synchronizing users on a chip level impairs performance for all chip waveforms
with bandwidth greater than the Nyquist bandwidth, e.g., positive roll-off
factors. For example, with the pulse shaping demanded in the UMTS standard,
user synchronization reduces spectral efficiency up to 12% at 10 dB normalized
signal-to-noise ratio. The benefits of asynchronism stem from the finding that
the excess bandwidth of chip waveforms actually spans additional dimensions in
signal space, if the users are de-synchronized on the chip-level. The analysis
of linear MMSE detectors shows that the limiting interference effects can be
decoupled both in the user domain and in the frequency domain such that the
concept of the effective interference spectral density arises. This generalizes
and refines Tse and Hanly's concept of effective interference.
  In Part II, the analysis is extended to any linear detector that admits a

further investigate the covering rough sets based on neighborhoods by

Pawlak introduced a quantitative measure of roughness by using the ratio of the
cardinalities of the lower and upper approximations. Although the roughness
measure is effective, it has the drawback of not being strictly monotonic with
respect to the standard ordering on partitions. Recently, some improvements
have been made by taking into account the granularity of partitions. In this
paper, we approach the roughness measure in an axiomatic way. After
axiomatically defining roughness measure and partition measure, we provide a
unified construction of roughness measure, called strong Pawlak roughness
measure, and then explore the properties of this measure. We show that the
improved roughness measures in the literature are special instances of our
strong Pawlak roughness measure and introduce three more strong Pawlak
roughness measures as well. The advantage of our axiomatic approach is that
some properties of a roughness measure follow immediately as soon as the
measure satisfies the relevant axiomatic definition.

process around a protostar. Whipple first noted that planetesimal growth by
particle agglomeration is strongly influenced by gas drag; there is a
""bottleneck"" at the meter scale with such bodies rapidly spiraling into the
central star, whereas much smaller or larger particles do not. Thus, successful
planetary accretion requires rapid planetesimal growth to km scale. A commonly
accepted picture is that for collisional velocities $V_c$ above a certain
threshold collisional velocity, ${V_{th}} \sim$ 0.1-10 cm s$^{-1}$, particle
agglomeration is not possible; elastic rebound overcomes attractive surface and
intermolecular forces. However, if perfect sticking is assumed for all
collisions the bottleneck can be overcome by rapid planetesimal growth. While
previous work has dealt explicitly with the influences of collisional pressures
and the possibility of particle fracture or penetration, the basic role of the
phase behavior of matter--phase diagrams, amorphs and polymorphs--has been
neglected. Here it is demonstrated that novel aspects of surface phase
transitions provide a physical basis for efficient sticking through collisional
melting or amphorph-/polymorphization and fusion to extend the collisional
velocity range of primary accretion to $\Delta V_c \sim$ 1-100 m s$^{-1}$,
which bound both turbulent RMS speeds and the velocity differences between
boulder sized and small grains $\sim$ 1-50 m s$^{-1}$. Thus, as inspiraling
meter sized bodies collide with smaller particles in this high velocity
collisional fusion regime they grow rapidly to km scales and hence settle into
stable Keplerian orbits in $\sim$ 10$^5$ years before photoevaporative wind

angular correlations of the CMB temperature field provides strong evidence
against the standard, statistically isotropic, inflationary LambdaCDM
cosmology. We compare various estimators of the temperature correlation
function showing how they depend on assumptions of statistical isotropy and how
they perform on the WMAP 5 year ILC maps with and without a sky cut. We show
that the low multipole harmonics that determine the large-scale features of the
temperature correlation function can be reconstructed accurately, independent
of any assumptions concerning statistical isotropy, from the data that lie
outside the sky cuts. The temperature correlation functions computed from our
reconstructions are in good agreement with those computed from the whole sky. A
Bayesian analysis of the large-scale correlations is presented which shows that
the data cannot exclude the standard LambdaCDM model. We discuss the
differences between our conclusions and those of Copi et al.

  Kretschmann Objection","54 pages",,,,"physics.hist-ph gr-qc hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Einstein considered general covariance to characterize the novelty of his
General Theory of Relativity (GTR), but Kretschmann thought it merely a formal
feature that any theory could have. The claim that GTR is ""already
parametrized"" suggests analyzing substantive general covariance as formal
general covariance achieved without hiding preferred coordinates as scalar
""clock fields,"" much as Einstein construed general covariance as the lack of
preferred coordinates. Physicists often install gauge symmetries artificially
with additional fields, as in the transition from Proca's to Stueckelberg's
electromagnetism. Some post-positivist philosophers, due to realist sympathies,
are committed to judging Stueckelberg's electromagnetism distinct from and
inferior to Proca's. By contrast, physicists identify them, the differences
being gauge-dependent and hence unreal. It is often useful to install gauge
freedom in theories with broken gauge symmetries (second-class constraints)
using a modified Batalin-Fradkin-Tyutin (BFT) procedure. Massive GTR, for which
parametrization and a Lagrangian BFT-like procedure appear to coincide, mimics
GTR's general covariance apart from telltale clock fields. A generalized
procedure for installing artificial gauge freedom subsumes parametrization and
BFT, while being more Lagrangian-friendly than BFT, leaving any primary
constraints unchanged and using a non-BFT boundary condition. Artificial gauge
freedom licenses a generalized Kretschmann objection. However, features of
paradigm cases of artificial gauge freedom might help to demonstrate a
principled distinction between substantive and merely formal gauge symmetry.

energy (dark fluid), and it has been proved that this model is equivalent to a
single fluid with time-dependent bulk viscosity. In this paper, we investigate
scalar perturbation of this viscosity dark fluid model. For particular
parameter selection, we find that perturbation quantity can be obtained exactly
in the future universe. We numerically solve the perturbation evolution
equations, and compare the results with those of $\Lambda$CDM model.
Gravitational potential and the density perturbation of the model studied here
have the similar behavior with the standard model, though there exists
significant value differences in the late universe.
