Earlier work has suggested that large-scale dynamos can reach and
maintain equipartition field strengths on a dynamical time scale only if
magnetic helicity of the fluctuating field can be shed from the domain through
open boundaries. Aims. Our aim is to test this scenario in convection-driven
dynamos by comparing results for open and closed boundary conditions. Methods.
Three-dimensional numerical simulations of turbulent compressible convection
with shear and rotation are used to study the effects of boundary conditions on
the excitation and saturation of large-scale dynamos. Open (vertical-field) and
closed (perfect-conductor) boundary conditions are used for the magnetic field.
The shear flow is such that the contours of shear are vertical, crossing the
outer surface, and are thus ideally suited for driving a shear-induced magnetic
helicity flux. Results. We find that for given shear and rotation rate, the
growth rate of the magnetic field is larger if open boundary conditions are
used. The growth rate first increases for small magnetic Reynolds number, Rm,
but then levels off at an approximately constant value for intermediate values
of Rm. For large enough Rm, a small-scale dynamo is excited and the growth rate
of the field in this regime increases as Rm^(1/2). Regarding the nonlinear
regime, the saturation level of the energy of the total magnetic field is
independent of Rm when open boundaries are used. In the case of perfect
conductor boundaries, the saturation level first increases as a function of Rm,
but then decreases proportional to Rm^(-1) for Rm > 30, indicative of
catastrophic quenching. These results suggest that the shear-induced magnetic
helicity flux is efficient in alleviating catastrophic quenching when open
boundaries are used. The horizontally averaged mean field is still weakly
decreasing as a function of Rm even for open boundaries.

MHz by space borne radio experiments, correspond to the quasi-continuous,

The mechanisms by which a storm can persist in some cases for more than a solar
rotation whilst exhibiting considerable radio activity are poorly understood.
To address this issue, the statistical properties of a type III storm observed
by the STEREO/WAVES radio experiment are presented, examining both the
brightness distribution and (for the first time) the waiting-time distribution.
Single power law behavior is observed in the number distribution as a function
of brightness; the power law index is approximately 2.1 and is largely
independent of frequency. The waiting-time distribution is found to be
consistent with a piecewise-constant Poisson process. This indicates that
during the storm individual type III bursts occur independently and suggests
that the storm dynamics are consistent with avalanche type behavior in the
underlying active region.

inefficient and cannot tolerate any noise. While their key-distribution scheme
uses quantum entanglement, its security only relies on the impossibility of
superluminal signaling, rather than the correctness and completeness of quantum

introduce a new protocol which is efficient in terms of both classical and

prove that it offers device-independent security under the sole assumption that
certain non-signaling conditions are satisfied. Our main insight is that the
XOR of a number of bits that are partially secret according to the
non-signaling conditions turns out to be highly secret. Note that similar
statements have been well-known in classical contexts. Earlier results had
indicated that amplification of such non-signaling-based privacy is impossible
to achieve if the non-signaling condition only holds between events on Alice's
and Bob's sides. Here, we show that the situation changes completely if such a
separation is given within each of the laboratories.

complex matrix, with U(N) gauge symmetry, contain hidden free particle
structures. These are exhibited using triangular matrix variables via the Schur
decomposition. The Brauer algebra basis for complex matrix models developed
earlier is useful in projecting to a sector which matches the state counting of
N free fermions on a circle. The Brauer algebra projection is characterized by
the vanishing of a scale invariant laplacian constructed from the complex
matrix. The special case of N=2 is studied in detail: the ring of gauge
invariant functions as well as a ring of scale and gauge invariant differential
operators are characterized completely. The orthonormal basis of wavefunctions
in this special case is completely characterized by a set of five commuting
Hamiltonians, which display free particle structures. Applications to the
reduced matrix quantum mechanics coming from radial quantization in N=4 SYM are
described. We propose that the string dual of the complex matrix harmonic
oscillator quantum mechanics has an interpretation in terms of strings and
branes in 2+1 dimensions.

detectable at X-ray and optical wavelengths due to their thermal emission and
can hence probe cooling curves. An identification of their birth sites can
constrain their age. For that reason we try to identify the parent associations
for four of the so-called Magnificent Seven neutron stars for which proper
motion and distance estimates are available. We are tracing back in time each
neutron star and possible birth association centre to find close encounters.
The associated time of the encounter expresses the kinematic age of the neutron
star which can be compared to its characteristic spin-down age. Owing to
observational uncertainties in the input data, we use Monte-Carlo simulations
and evaluate the outcome of our calculations statistically. RX J1856.5-3754
most probably originated from the Upper Scorpius association about 0.3 Myr ago.
RX 0720.4-3125 was either born in the young local association TWA about 0.4 Myr
ago or in Tr 10 0.5 Myr in the past. Also RX J1605.3+3249 and RBS 1223 seem to
come from a nearby young association such as the Sco-Cen complex or the
extended Corona-Australis association. For RBS 1223 also a birth in Sct OB2 is
possible. We also give constraints on the observables as well as on the radial
velocity of the neutron star. Given the birth association, its age and the
flight time of the neutron star, we estimate the mass of the progenitor star.
Some of the potential supernovae were located very nearby (<100pc) and thus
should have contributed to the 10Be and 60Fe material found in the Earth's
crust. In addition we reinvestigate the previously suggested neutron star/
runaway pair PSR B1929+10/ zeta Ophiuchi and conclude that it is very likely
that both objects were ejected during the same supernova event.

related techniques. The parent wurtzite InN (InN-w) phase disappears from the
surface and gradually forms a highly textured cubic layer that completely wraps
up a InN-w nucleus which still remains from original single-crystalline quantum
dots. The good reticular relationships between the different crystals generate
low misfit strains and explain the apparent easiness for phase transformations
at room temperature and pressure conditions, but also disable the classical
methods to identify phases and grains from TEM images. The application of the
geometrical phase algorithm in order to form numerical moire mappings, and RGB
multilayered image reconstructions allows to discern among the different phases
and grains formed inside these nanostructures. Samples aged for shorter times
reveal the presence of metastable InN:O zincblende (zb) volumes, which acts as
the intermediate phase between the initial InN-w and the most stable cubic
In2O3 end phase. These cubic phases are highly twinned with a proportion of
50:50 between both orientations. We suggest that the existence of the
intermediate InN:O-zb phase should be seriously considered to understand the
reason of the widely scattered reported fundamental properties of thought to be
InN-w, as its bandgap or superconductivity.

short GRB 090510. We use the broad-band data to test whether the most popular
theoretical models for gamma-ray burst emission can accommodate the
observations for this burst. We first attempt to explain the soft-to-hard
spectral evolution associated with the delayed onset of a GeV tail with the
hypothesis that the prompt burst and the high energy tail both originate from a
single process, namely synchrotron emission from internal shocks.
Considerations on the compactness of the source imply that the high-energy tail
should be produced in a late-emitted shell, characterized by a Lorentz factor
greater than the one generating the prompt burst. However, in this hypothesis,
the predicted evolution of the synchrotron peak frequency does not agree with
the observed soft-to-hard evolution. Given the difficulties of a
single-mechanism hypothesis, we test two alternative double-component
scenarios. In the first, the prompt burst is explained as synchrotron radiation
from internal shocks, and the high energy emission (up to about 1 s following
the trigger) as internal shock synchrotron-self-Compton. In the second
scenario, in view of its long duration (\sim 100 s), the high energy tail is
decoupled from the prompt burst and has an external shock origin. In this case,
we show that a reasonable choice of parameters does indeed exist to accommodate
the optical-to-GeV data, provided the Lorentz factor of the shocked shell is
sufficiently high. Finally, we attempt to explain the chromatic break observed
around \sim 1e3 s with a structured jet model. We find that this might be a
viable explanation, and that it lowers the high value of the burst energy
derived assuming isotropy, \sim 1e53 erg, below \sim 1e49 erg, more compatible
with the energetics from a binary merger progenitor.

Galaxy. As their progenitors are commonly found clustered in OB associations,
one has to consider the possibility of collective effects in the acceleration
process. In this work we investigate the shape of the spectrum of protons
accelerated inside the superbubbles blown around clusters of massive stars. To
do so we embed semi-analytical models of particle acceleration and transport
inside Monte-Carlo simulations of OB associations timelines. We consider
regular acceleration at the shock front of supernova remnants, as well as
stochastic re-acceleration and escape occurring between the shocks. We observe
that particle spectra, although strongly intermittent, get a distinctive shape
resulting from a competition between acceleration and escape: they are harder
at the lowest energies and softer at the highest energies. The momentum at
which this spectral break occurs depends on a single dimensionless parameter,
which we evaluate for a selection of objects. The behaviour of a superbubble
regarding acceleration depends on the magnetic turbulence: if B is low the
superbubble is simply the host of a collection of individual supernovae shocks,
but if B is high enough it acts as a global accelerator, producing distinctive
spectra ? which has important implications on the high-energy emission from
these objects.

neutrino produces equal lepton asymmetry in both sectors via resonant
leptogenesis which then get converted to baryonic and dark baryonic matter. The
dark baryon asymmetry due to higher dark nucleon masses leads to higher dark
matter density compared to the familiar baryon density that is observed. The

starts from the cumulant expansion of the periodic Anderson model (PAM),
employing the hybridization as perturbation. The atomic Anderson limit is
analytically solved and its sixteen eigenenergies and eigenstates are obtained.
This atomic Anderson solution, which we call the (AAS), has all the fundamental
excitations that generate the Kondo effect, and in the atomic approach is
employed as a seed to generate the approximate solutions for finite U. The
width of the conduction band is reduced to zero in the AAS, and we choose its

potential.

(IV-regime),the Kondo and the magnetic regime. In the Kondo regime we obtain a
density of states that characterizes well the structure of the Kondo peak. To
shown the usefulness of the method we have calculated the conductance of a

dispersing, or gapped. Including spatial structure, interactions between the

next-to-eikonal logarithmic contributions to the physical kernels at any loop
order can be expressed in term of the one-loop cusp anomalous dimension, a
result which can presumably be extended to all orders in (1-x), and has eluded
so far threshold resummation. Similar results are shown to hold for
fragmentation functions in semi-inclusive e+ e- annihilation. Gribov-Lipatov

categories of coherent sheaves on weighted projective lines. Two different

a description in terms of expansions of abelian categories.
  A weighted projective line is obtained from a projective line by inserting
finitely many weights. So we describe the category of coherent sheaves on a
projective line in some detail, and the insertion of weights amounts to adding
simple objects. We call this process `expansion' and treat it axiomatically.
Thus most of these notes are devoted to studying abelian categories, including

oscillates through the galaxy centre perpendicular or parallel to the plane of
the galaxy for a model galaxy consisting of an exponential disk, a Plummer
model bulge, and an isothermal dark matter halo. For the perpendicular motion
we find that there is a strong resonant forcing of the disk radial motion near

frequency is equal one-half, one-fourth, (1/6, etc.) of the radial epicyclic
frequency in the plane of the disk. Near the resonant radii there can be a
strong enhancement of the radial flow and disk density which can lead to shock
formation. In turn the shock may trigger the formation of a ring of stars near
$r_R$. As an example, for a BH mass of $10^8 M_\odot$ and a kick velocity of
150 km s$^{-1}$, we find that the resonant radii lie between 0.2 and 1 kpc. For
BH motion parallel to the plane of the galaxy we find that the BH leaves behind

there is less than a 10% chance that a Milky Way halo with M_vir =10^12 M_sun

rises to ~25% for a halo with M_vir=2.5 x 10^12 M_sun. The statistics relevant

140 (2008)], represents a mathematical and physical generalisation of the
Mie-Gr\""{u}neisen EOS for isotropic material and reduces to this equation in
the limit of isotropy. Although a linear relation between the generalised
anisotropic bulk shock velocity $U^{A}_{s}$ and particle velocity $u_{p}$ was
adequate in the through-thickness orientation, damage softening process
produces discontinuities both in value and slope in the $U^{A}_{s}$-$u_{p}$
relation. Therefore, the two-wave structure (non-linear anisotropic and
isotropic elastic waves) that accompanies damage softening process was proposed
for describing CFC behaviour under shock loading. The linear relationship
$U^{A}_{s}$-$u_{p}$ over the range of measurements corresponding to non-linear
anisotropic elastic wave shows a value of $c^{A}_{0}$ (the intercept of the
$U^{A}_{s}$-$u_{p}$ curve) that is in the range between first and second
generalised anisotropic bulk speed of sound [Eur. Phys. J. B \textbf{64}, 159

different directions for a CFC composite subject to the two-wave structure

Prospects for indirect detection from solar capture are good due to a large
sneutrino-nucleon cross-section afforded by the inelastic splitting (solar
capture limits exclude an explanation of DAMA/LIBRA). We find parameter regions
where all heavier states will have decayed, leaving only one flavour mixture of
sneutrino as the candidate DM. Such regions have a unique `smoking gun'
signature--sneutrino annihilation in the Sun produces a pair of neutrino mass
eigenstates free from vacuum oscillations, with the potential for detection at
neutrino telescopes through the observation of a hard spectrum of nu_mu and
nu_tau (for a normal neutrino hierarchy). Next generation direct detection
experiments can explore much of the parameter space through both elastic and

renormalization of impurity parameters due to the bath propagator. At any step
of the NRG calculation, this renormalization is only partially taken into
account, leading to systematic variation of the impurity parameters along the
flow. This effect can cause qualitatively incorrect results when studying
quantum critical phenomena, as it leads to an implicit variation of the phase
transition's control parameter as function of the temperature and thus to an
unphysical temperature dependence of the order-parameter mass. We demonstrate
the mass-flow effect for bosonic impurity models with a power law bath
spectrum, J(w) ~ w^s, namely the dissipative harmonic oscillator and the
spin-boson model. We propose an extension of the NRG to correct the mass-flow
error. Using this, we find unambiguous signatures of a Gaussian critical fixed
point in the spin-boson model for s<1/2, consistent with mean-field behavior as
expected from quantum-to-classical mapping.

In particular, we show that the variation of position of the hot spot created
by the infalling matter, as observed in 3D simulations, can produce high
frequency Quasi Periodic Oscillations with frequencies associated with the
inner zone of the disk. Previously reported simulations showed that the usual
assumption of a fixed hot spot near the polar region is valid only for
misalignment angles relatively large. Otherwise, two phenomena challenge the
assumption: one is the presence of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities at the
disk-magnetospheric boundary, which produce tongues of accreting matter that
can reach the star almost anywhere between the equator and the polar region;
the other one is the motion of the hot spot around the magnetic pole during
stable accretion. In this paper we start by showing that both phenomena are
capable of producing short-term oscillations in the lightcurves. We then use
Monte Carlo techniques to produce model lightcurves based on the features of
the movements observed, and we show that the main features of kHz QPOs can be
reproduced. Finally, we show the behavior of the frequencies of the moving
spots as the mass accretion rate changes, and propose a mechanism for the
production of double QPO peaks.

percolation processes and then are solved using generating function
formulations. This approach assumes that the network is infinite and weakly
connected, yet furthermore approximates a dynamic cascading process as a static
percolation event. In this paper we propose a dynamic Markov model formulation
that assumes a finite network with arbitrary average nodal degree. We apply it
to the case where cascades follow a threshold rule, that is, that a node will
change state (""flip"") only if a fraction, exceeding a given threshold, of its
neighbors has changed state previously. The corresponding state transition
matrix, recalculated after each step, records the probability that a node of
degree k has i flipped neighbors after j steps in the cascade's evolution. This
theoretical model reproduces a number of behaviors observed in simulations but
not yet reported in the literature. These include the ability to predict
cascades in a domain previously predicted to forbid cascades without assuming
that the network is locally tree-like, and, due to the dynamic nature of the
model, a ""near death"" behavior in which cascades initially appear about to die
but later explode. Cascades in the ""no cascades"" region require a sufficiently
large seed of initially flipped nodes whose size scales with the size of the
network or else the cascade will die out. Our theory also predicts the well
known properties of cascades, for instance that a single node seed can start a
global cascade in the appropriate regime regardless of the (finite) size of the
network. The theory and simulations developed here are compared with a
foundational paper by Watts which used generating function theory.

(LMXB) 4U 1957+11 is presented. The source was observed in V, R and i-bands
using the Faulkes Telescopes North and South. The light curve is dominated by
long-term variations which are correlated (at the > 3 sigma level) with the
RXTE ASM soft X-ray flux. The variations span one magnitude in all three
filters. We find no evidence for periodicities in our light curves, contrary to
a previous short-timescale optical study in which the flux varied on a 9.3-hour
sinusoidal period by a smaller amplitude. The optical spectral energy
distribution is blue and typical of LMXBs in outburst, as is the power law
index of the correlation beta = 0.5, where F_{nu,OPT} propto F_X^beta. The
discrete cross-correlation function reveals a peak at an X-ray lag of 2 - 14
days, which could be the viscous timescale. However, adopting the least squares
method the strongest correlation is at a lag of 0 +/- 4 days, consistent with
X-ray reprocessing on the surface of the disc. We therefore constrain the
optical lag behind X-ray to be between -14 and +4 days. In addition, we use the
optical - X-ray luminosity diagram for LMXBs as a diagnostic tool to constrain
the nature of the compact object in 4U 1957+11, since black hole (BH) and
neutron star (NS) sources reside in different regions of this diagram. If the
system contains a BH (as is the currently favoured hypothesis), its distance
must exceed ~ 20 kpc for the optical and X-ray luminosities to be consistent
with other soft state BH systems. For distances < 20 kpc, the data lie in a
region of the diagram populated only by NS sources. 4U 1957+11 is unique: it is
either the only BH LMXB to exist in an apparent persistent soft state, or it is
a NS LMXB which behaves like a black hole.

detection of broad and complex HI Ly$\beta$ absorption in archival FUSE spectra
of PKS~0558-504, at redshifts $z=0.1183 \pm 0.0001$ consistent with the
best-fitting redshift of the X-ray absorber. The single line statistical
significance of this line is 4.1$\sigma$ (3.7$\sigma$ if systematics are
considered), and thus the combined (HI+OVIII) statistical significance of the
detection is of 5.0$\sigma$.
  The detection of both metal and H lines at a consistent redshift, in this hot
absorbing system, allows us to speculate on its metallicity. By associating the
bulk of the X-ray absorber with the BLB line detected in the FUSE spectrum at
$z_{BLB}=0.1183 \pm 0.0001$, we obtain a metallicity of 1-4\% Solar.

-- based only on beamforming -- for K-user MIMO interference channels. Our main
contribution is to relate the feasibility issue to the problem of determining
the solvability of a multivariate polynomial system, considered extensively in
algebraic geometry. It is well known, e.g. from Bezout's theorem, that generic
polynomial systems are solvable if and only if the number of equations does not
exceed the number of variables. Following this intuition, we classify signal
space interference alignment problems as either proper or improper based on the
number of equations and variables. Rigorous connections between feasible and
proper systems are made through Bernshtein's theorem for the case where each
transmitter uses only one beamforming vector. The multi-beam case introduces
dependencies among the coefficients of a polynomial system so that the system
is no longer generic in the sense required by both theorems. In this case, we
show that the connection between feasible and proper systems can be further
strengthened (since the equivalency between feasible and proper systems does
not always hold) by including standard information theoretic outer bounds in
the feasibility analysis.

a smaller fine-structure constant, alpha, compared to the current laboratory
value, in a sample of 143 quasar absorption systems:
da/a=(-0.57+/-0.11)x10^{-5}. This was based on a variety of metal-ion
transitions which, if alpha varies, experience different relative velocity
shifts. This result is yet to be robustly contradicted, or confirmed, by
measurements on other telescopes and spectrographs; it remains crucial to do
so. It is also important to consider new possible instrumental systematic
effects which may explain the Keck/HIRES results. Griest et al. (2009,
arXiv:0904.4725v1) recently identified distortions in the echelle order
wavelength scales of HIRES with typical amplitudes +/-250m/s. Here we
investigate the effect such distortions may have had on the Keck/HIRES varying
alpha results. We demonstrate that they cause a random effect on da/a from
absorber to absorber because the systems are at different redshifts, placing
the relevant absorption lines at different positions in different echelle
orders. The typical magnitude of the effect on da/a is ~0.4x10^{-5} per
absorber which, compared to the median error on da/a in the sample,
~1.9x10^{-5}, is relatively small. Consequently, the weighted mean value
changes by less than 0.05x10^{-5} if the corrections we calculate are applied.
Nevertheless, we urge caution, particularly for analyses aiming to achieve high
precision da/a measurements on individual systems or small samples, that a much
more detailed understanding of such intra-order distortions and their
dependence on observational parameters is important if they are to be avoided
or modelled reliably. [Abridged]

this paper we define the syntax and semantics of BioBeta, analyse its

The violation signifies a fundamental asymmetry between the past and future and
calls for a major shift in the way we think about time. Here we show that
processes which violate T symmetry induce destructive interference between
different paths that the universe can take through time. The interference
eliminates all paths except for two that represent continuously forwards and
continuously backwards time evolution. Evidence from the accelerator

work may provide fresh insight into the long-standing problem of modeling the
dynamics of T violation processes. It suggests that T violation has previously

low-power radio galaxies we find that the host galaxies of extended Fanaroff &
Riley type-I radio sources are generally HI poor (< 10E8 M_sun) and show no
indications for gas-rich galaxy mergers or ongoing gas-rich interactions. In
contrast, the host galaxies of a significant fraction of low-power compact
radio sources contain enormous discs/rings of HI gas (with sizes up to 190 kpc
and masses up to 2 x 10E10 M_sun). This segregation in HI mass with radio
source size likely indicates that these compact radio sources are either
confined by large amounts of gas in the central region, or that their fueling
is inefficient and different from the fueling process of classical FR-I radio
sources. To a first order, the overall HI properties of our complete sample
(detection rate, mass and morphology) appear similar to those of radio-quiet
early-type galaxies. If confirmed by better statistics, this would imply that
low-power radio-AGN activity may be a short phase that occurs at some point

Jupiter inside the magnetospheric cavity of a proto-planetary disk. The model
takes into account the disk locking of stellar spin as well as the tidal and
magnetic interactions between the star and the planet. We focus on the orbital
evolution starting from the orbit in the 2:1 resonance with the inner edge of
the disk, followed by the inward and then outward orbital migration driven by
the tidal and magnetic torques as well as the Roche-lobe overflow of the
tidally inflated planet. The goal in this paper is to study how the orbital
evolution inside the magnetospheric cavity depends on the cavity size, planet
mass, and orbital eccentricity. In the present work, we only target the mass
range from 0.7 to 2 Jupiter masses. In the case of the large cavity
corresponding to the rotational period ~ 7 days, the planet of mass >1 Jupiter
mass with moderate initial eccentricities (>~ 0.3) can move to the region <
0.03 AU from its central star in 10^7 years, while the planet of mass <1
Jupiter mass cannot. We estimate the critical eccentricity beyond which the
planet of a given mass will overflow its Roche radius and finally lose all of
its gas onto the star due to runaway mass loss. In the case of the small cavity
corresponding to the rotational period ~ 3 days, all of the simulated planets
lose all of their gas even in circular orbits. Our results for the orbital
evolution of young hot Jupiters may have the potential to explain the absence

intuitively, counter-rotate with respect to the rotating drum. The flow was
measured with particle image velocimetry (PIV), and it was found that the inner
cylinder significantly altered the bulk flow field from the solid-body rotation
found for a fluid filled drum. In the counter-rotation case, the generated lift
force allowed the cylinder to freely rotate without contact with the drum wall.
Drag and lift coefficients of the freely counter-rotating cylinder were
measured over a wide range of Reynolds numbers, 2,500 $<$ Re $<$ 25,000,
dimensionless rotation rates, 0.0$ < \alpha < $1.2, and gap to cylinder
diameter ratios 0.003 $< G/2a <$ 0.5. Drag coefficients were consistent with
previous measurements on a cylinder in a uniform flow. However, for the lift

great interest as a novel single atom quantum probe for nanoscale processes.
However, until now, beyond the use of diamond nanocrystals as fluorescence

explore in detail the quantum dynamics of a NV probe in proximity to the ion

results indicate that real-time detection of ion channel operation at
millisecond resolution is possible by directly monitoring the quantum
decoherence of the NV probe. With the potential to scan and scale-up to an

Based on 38 light-curve timings from the Wilson-Devinney code and all other
minimum epochs, a period study of GW Cep reveals that the orbital period has
experienced a sinusoidal variation with a period and semi-amplitude of 32.6 yrs
and 0.009 d, respectively. In principle, these may be produced either by a
light-travel-time effect due to a third body or by an active magnetic cycle of
at least one component star. Because we failed to find any connection between
luminosity variability and the period change, that change most likely arises
from the existence of an unseen third companion star with a minimum mass of
0.22 $M_\odot$ gravitationally bound to the eclipsing pair.

Such a decay of the D-brane is known to be closely related to the rolling

D-brane caused by gravitational attraction can be avoided. Namely for certain
values of energy and angular momentum the D-brane orbits around the fivebranes,
maintaining certain distance from the fivebranes all the time, and the process
of tachyon condensation is suppressed. We show that the tachyonic degree of

governed by the efficiency of the mixing protocol.

with exceptional surface brightness sensitivity and low confusion. The ATLBS
radio images, made with 0.08 mJy/beam rms noise and 50"" beam, detect a total of
1094 sources with peak flux exceeding 0.4 mJy/beam. The ATLBS source counts
were corrected for blending, noise bias, resolution, and primary beam
attenuation; the normalized differential source counts are consistent with no
upturn down to 0.6 mJy. The percentage integrated polarization Pi_0 was
computed after corrections for the polarization bias in integrated polarized
intensity; Pi_0 shows an increasing trend with decreasing flux density.
Simultaneous visibility measurements made with longer baselines yielded images,
with 5"" beam, of compact components in sources detected in the survey. The
observations provide a measurement of the complexity and diffuse emission
associated with mJy and sub-mJy radio sources. 10% of the ATLBS sources have
more than half of their flux density in extended emission and the fractional
flux in diffuse components does not appear to vary with flux density, although
the percentage of sources that have complex structure increases with flux
density. The observations are consistent with a transition in the nature of
extended radio sources from FR-II radio source morphology, which dominates the
mJy population, to FR-I structure at sub-mJy flux density. (Abridged)

typically begins when the Universe is already substantially larger than the
fundamental scale [such as the one defined by the string length scale]. This is
naturally explained by postulating a pre-inflationary era, during which the
size of the Universe grew from the fundamental scale to the initial
inflationary scale. The problem then arises of maintaining the [presumed]
initial spatial homogeneity throughout this era, so that, when it terminates,
Inflation is able to begin in its potential-dominated state. Linde has proposed
that a spacetime with compact negatively curved spatial sections can achieve
this, by means of chaotic mixing. Such a compactification will however lead to
a Casimir energy, which can lead to effects that defeat the purpose unless the
coupling to gravity is suppressed. We estimate the value of this coupling
required by the proposal, and use it to show that the pre-inflationary
spacetime is stable, despite the violation of the Null Energy Condition

was discovered during solar cycle 21 in high energy solar flares, and its
presence in sunspot areas and strong magnetic flux has been also reported. This
periodicity has an elusive and enigmatic character, since it usually appears
only near the maxima of solar cycles, and seems to be related with a periodic
emergence of strong magnetic flux at the solar surface. Therefore, it is
probably connected with the tachocline, a thin layer located near the base of
the solar convection zone, where strong dynamo magnetic field is stored. We
study the dynamics of Rossby waves in the tachocline in the presence of a
toroidal magnetic field and latitudinal differential rotation. Our analysis
shows that the magnetic Rossby waves are generally unstable and that the growth
rates are sensitive to the magnetic field strength and to the latitudinal
differential rotation parameters. Variation of the differential rotation and
the magnetic field strength throughout the solar cycle enhance the growth rate
of a particular harmonic in the upper part of the tachocline around the maximum
of the solar cycle. This harmonic is symmetric with respect to the equator and
has a period of 155-160 days. A rapid increase of the wave amplitude could give
place to a magnetic flux emergence leading to observed periodicities in solar

spectroscopy of W33A and its inner reflection nebula. In our data we make the
first detections of a rotationally-flattened outer envelope and fast bi-polar
jet of a massive YSO at near-infrared wavelengths. The predominant spectral
features observed are Br-gamma, H_2, and a combination of emission and
absorption from CO gas. We perform a 3-D spectro-astrometric analysis of the
line emission, the first study of its kind. We find that the object's Br-gamma
emission reveals evidence for a fast bi-polar jet on sub-milliarcsecond scales,
which is aligned with the larger-scale outflow. The hybrid CO features can be
explained as a combination of hot CO emission arising in a disk close to the
central star, while cold CO absorption originates in the cooler outer envelope.
Kinematic analysis of these features reveals that both structures are rotating,
and consistent with being aligned perpendicularly to both the ionised jet and
the large-scale outflow. Assuming Keplerian rotation, we find that the
circumstellar disk orbits a central mass of >10Msun, while the outer envelope
encloses a mass of ~15Msun. Our results suggest a scenario of a central star
accreting material from a circumstellar disk at the centre of a cool extended
rotating torus, while driving a fast bi-polar wind. These results therefore
provide strong supporting evidence for the hypothesis that the formation
mechanism for high-mass stars is qualitatively similar to that of low-mass
stars.

degree below 0.1mJy. There is a growing consensus that a large fraction of
these sources are dominated by star formation although the exact proportion has
been debated in the literature. However, the low luminosity of these galaxies
at most other wavelengths makes determining the nature of individual sources
difficult. If future, deeper surveys performed with the next generation of
radio instrumentation are to reap high scientific reward we need to develop
reliable methods of distinguishing between radio emission powered by active
galactic nuclei (AGN) and that powered by star formation. In particular, we
believe that such discriminations should be based on purely radio, or relative
to radio, diagnostics. These diagnostics include radio morphology, radio
spectral index, polarisation, variability, radio luminosity and flux density
ratios with non-radio wavelengths e.g. with different parts of the infrared
(IR) regime. We discuss the advantages and limitations of these various
diagnostics methods with current and future surveys. However, weeding AGN out
of deep radio surveys can already provide several insights into the star
formation at high redshift. As well as reproducing the well known rise with
redshift in the comoving star formation rate density, we also see evidence for
the continued dominance of LIRGs and ULIRGs to the total star forming budget
across redshifts 1-3. Additionally, while we see that the IR-radio relation for
star forming galaxies does hold to high redshifts (z>1) there is a mild
deviation depending on the IR waveband used and the range of IR SEDs found. We
will discuss the possible reasons behind this change in properties.

Jupiter's moon Europa. The heavy energetic ions of the Jovian plasma (H+, O+,
S+, C+) can erode the surface of Europa via ion sputtering (IS), ejecting up to
1000 H2O molecules per ion. UV Photons impinging the Europa's surface can also
result in neutral atom release via photon-stimulated desorption (PSD) and
chemical change (photolysis). In this work, we study the efficiency of the IS
and PSD processes for ejecting water molecules, simulating the resulting
neutral H2O density. We also estimate the contribution to the total neutral
atom release by the Ion Backscattering (IBS) process. Moreover, we estimate the
possibility of detecting the sputtered high energy atoms, in order to
distinguish the action of the IS process from other surface release mechanisms.
Our main results are: 1) The most significant sputtered-particle flux and the
largest contribution to the neutral H2O-density come from the incident S+ ions;
2) The H2O density produced via PSD is lower than that due to sputtering by
~1.5 orders of magnitude; 3) In the energy range below 1 keV, the IBS can be
considered negligible for the production of neutrals, whereas in the higher
energy range it becomes the dominant neutral emission mechanism; 4) the total
sputtering rate for Europa is 2.0\cdot 1027 H2O s-1; 5) the fraction of
escaping H2O via IS is 22% of the total sputtered population, while the escape
fraction for H2O produced by PSD is 30% of the total PSD population. Since the
PSD exosphere is lower than the IS one, the major agent for Europa's surface
erosion is IS on both the non-illuminated and illuminated side. Lastly, the
exospheric neutral density, estimated from the Galileo electron density
measurements appears to be higher than that calculated for H2O alone; this
favours the scenario of the presence of O2 produced by radiolysis and
photolysis.

with the oxygen vacancy type defects. No significant change in the grain size
of the irradiated samples, as revealed from the x-ray diffraction (XRD) line
width broadening, has been observed. Increase of surface roughness due to
sputtering is clearly visible in scanning electron micrographs (SEM) with
highest fluence of irradiation. Room temperature Photoluminescence (PL)
spectrum of the unirradiated sample shows intense ultra-violet (UV) emission (~
3.27 eV) and less prominent defect level emissions (2-3 eV). The overall
emission is largely quenched due to initial irradiation fluence. But with
increasing fluence UV emission is enhanced along with prominent defect level
emissions. Remarkably, the resistivity of the irradiated sample with highest
fluence is reduced by four orders of magnitude compared to that of the
unirradiated sample. This indicates increase of donor concentration as well as
their mobility due to irradiation. Oxygen vacancies are deep donors in ZnO, but
surely they influence the stability of the shallow donors (presumably zinc
interstitial related) and vice versa. This is in conformity with recent

unique probe of the epoch of reionization and the Dark Ages. Three major
mechanisms are believed to dominate the radiation process: emission from
neutral hydrogen surrounding the ionized bubbles of first galaxies and/or
quasars, emission from neutral hydrogen inside minihalos, and absorption of
diffuse neutral hydrogen against the cosmic microwave background. In the
present work, by simply combining the existing analytic models for the three
mechanisms, we investigate the contribution of cross-correlation between these
three components to the total 21cm angular power spectrum, in the sense that
neutral hydrogen associated with different radiation processes traces the
large-scale structures of underlying density perturbations. While the overall
21cm power spectrum remains almost unchanged with the inclusion of the
cross-correlations, the cross-correlation may play a key role in the
determination of the 21cm power spectrum during the transition of 21cm
radiation from emission-dominated phase to absorption-dominated phase at
redshift z~20. A significant suppression in the 21cm angular power spectrum
during this transition is anticipated as the result of negative contribution of
the cross-correlation between the absorption of diffuse neutral hydrogen and
the emission components. Therefore, an accurate prediction of the cosmic 21cm
power spectrum should take the cross-correlation into account especially at the
transition phase.

lower level is totally resolved. The coherent laser pulse is assumed to be in
resonance with the transition between one hyperfine structure component of the

the electron Fermi energy can be attained. In the relativistic treatment there
exists a limiting configuration, reached when the Wigner-Seitz cell radius
equals the radius of the nucleus, with a maximum value of the electron Fermi
energy $(E_e^F)_{max}$, here expressed analytically in the ultra-relativistic
approximation. The corrections given by the relativistic Thomas-Fermi-Dirac
exchange term are also evaluated and shown to be generally small and negligible
in the relativistic high density regime. The dependence of the relativistic
electron Fermi energies by compression for selected nuclei are compared and
contrasted to the non-relativistic ones and to the ones obtained in the uniform
approximation. The relativistic Feynman, Metropolis, Teller approach here
presented overcomes some difficulties in the Salpeter approximation generally
adopted for compressed matter in physics and astrophysics. The treatment is
then extrapolated to compressed nuclear matter cores of stellar dimensions with
$A\simeq (m_{\rm Planck}/m_n)^3 \sim 10^{57}$ or $M_{core}\sim M_{\odot}$. A
new family of equilibrium configurations exists for selected values of the
electron Fermi energy varying in the range $0 < E_e^F \leq (E_e^F)_{max}$. Such
configurations fulfill global but not local charge neutrality. They have
electric fields on the core surface, increasing for decreasing values of the
electron Fermi energy reaching values much larger than the critical value $E_c
= m_e^2c^3/(e\hbar)$, for $E_e^F=0$. We compare and contrast our results with
the ones of Thomas-Fermi model in strange stars.

application of this novel approach we adopt the Baym, Bethe, and Pethick (1971)

by the boundary conditions satisfied by the leptonic component of the matter at

entire new family of equilibrium configurations exists for selected values of
the Fermi energy of the electrons at the surface of the core. Each such

Amer and A. Brumer have shown that, for two homogeneous quadratic

different from 2, the locus f=g=0 has non-trivial solution over k if and only
if, for a variable t, the equation f+tg=0 has a non-trivial solution over k(t).
We consider a modified version of this result, and show that the projective

polynomials over k of the same degree d\ge2 in n+1 variables (with n+1\ge r+2)

within a virial expansion approach with particular interest in the ratio of
$\eta$ to the entropy density $s$, i.e. $\eta/s$. The virial expansion approach
allows us to include the interactions between the partons in the deconfined
phase and to evaluate the corrections to a single-particle partition function.
In the latter approach we start with an effective interaction with parameters
fixed to reproduce thermodynamical quantities of QCD such as energy and/or
entropy density. We also directly extract the effective coupling $\ga_{\rm V}$
for the determination of $\eta$. Our numerical results give a ratio
$\eta/s\approx 0.097$ at the critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$, which is very
close to the theoretical bound of $1/(4\pi)$. Furthermore, for temperatures
$T\leq 1.8 T_{\rm c}$ the ratio $\eta/s$ is in the range of the present
experimental estimates $0.1-0.3$ at RHIC. When combining our results for
$\eta/s$ in the deconfined phase with those from chiral perturbation theory or
the resonance gas model in the confined phase we observe a pronounced minimum
of $\eta/s$ close to the critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$.

calculate shell corrections for spherical and deformed nuclei. The expansion is
carried out up to fourth order in $\hbar$. A systematic study of
Wigner-Kirkwood averaged energies is presented as a function of the deformation
degrees of freedom. The shell corrections, along with the pairing energies
obtained by using the Lipkin-Nogami scheme, are used in the
microscopic-macroscopic approach to calculate binding energies. The macroscopic
part is obtained from a liquid drop formula with six adjustable parameters.
Considering a set of 367 spherical nuclei, the liquid drop parameters are
adjusted to reproduce the experimental binding energies, which yields a {\it
rms} deviation of 630 keV. It is shown that the proposed approach is indeed
promising for the prediction of nuclear masses.

extracted from different groups of subjects. We start from a generative model
of the fMRI group data to introduce a probabilistic ICA pattern-extraction
algorithm, called CanICA (Canonical ICA). Thanks to an explicit noise model and
canonical correlation analysis, our method is auto-calibrated and identifies
the group-reproducible data subspace before performing ICA. We compare our

of temporary oxygen-solvent complexes. In dependence on the photon energy
oxygen molecules may be excited alone or in combination with roto-vibrational
