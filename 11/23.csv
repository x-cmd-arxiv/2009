the toy model, medium effects increase the CP-violating parameter. In contrast

two collinear impact-parameter Beam Functions (iBFs) and an inverse Soft

study of differential distributions at hadron colliders. The additional
factorization of the p_T-scale physics simplifies the implementation of higher

proton flux predicted by the dip model and that measured by Kascade in the
critical energy interval 5 x 10 ** 16 - 10 ** 17 eV. It is mentioned and
substantiated that the proton flux measurements of the Kascade experiment are
consistent with other pertinent empirical observations. It is shown that the
chemical composition measured by Auger by two independent procedures, using the
mean depth reached by cosmic nuclei in giant air cascades, is incompatible with
that predicted by the dip model. A notable consequence suggested here based on
the failures of the dip model is that the spectral index softening of the
primary cosmic radiation above 6 x 10 ** 19 eV observed by HiRes and Auger
experiments, is not due to the extragalactic cosmological protons suffering
energy losses in the intergalactic space via the reactions, p gamma -> pi0 p,
pi+ n, but to some physical phenomena occurring in the cosmic vicinity.

that the pure braid groups are residually nilpotent. They also proved that the

  This brief note uses an example to provide evidence for a much stronger
statement: that each braid $b$ can be written as an infinite sum $b
=\sum_0^\infty b_i$, where each $b_i$ is a linear function of the $i$-th
Vassiliev-Kontsevich $Z_i(b)$ invariant of $b$. The example is pure braids on
two strands. This leads to solving $e^\tau=q$ for $\tau$ a Laurent series in
$q$. We set $\tau = \sum_1^\infty (-1)^{n+1} (q^n - q^{-n})/n$ and use Fourier
series and Parseval's theorem to prove $e^\tau=q$.
  For more than two strands the stronger statement seems to rely on an as yet

class of processes, we introduce a single parameter such that for any $\nu \in

$\E{x^2(t)} \sim t^\nu$ for large $t$.
  The motivation for the specific structure of these sums of OU processes comes
from the Rouse chain model from polymer kinetic theory. We generalize the model
by studying the general dynamics of individual particles in networks of
thermally fluctuating beads connected by Hookean springs. Such a set-up is
similar to the study of Kac-Zwanzig heat bath models. Whereas the existing heat
bath literature places its assumptions on the spectrum of the Laplacian matrix
associated to the spring connection graph, we study explicit graph structures.
In this setting we prove a notion of universality for the Rouse chain's

demonstrate the existence of other anomalous behavior by changing the dimension

helioseismology is essential to get an accurate understanding of the solar
properties that are inferred from them. It has long been observed that sunspots
suppress p-mode amplitude, but its implications on travel times has not been
fully investigated so far. It has been found in test measurements using a
'masking' procedure, in which the solar Doppler signal in a localized quiet
region of the Sun is artificially suppressed by a spatial function, and using
numerical simulations that the amplitude modulations in combination with the
phase-speed filtering may cause systematic shifts of acoustic travel times. To
understand the properties of this procedure, we derive an analytical expression
for the cross-covariance of a signal that has been modulated locally by a
spatial function that has azimuthal symmetry, and then filtered by a phase
speed filter typically used in time-distance helioseismology. Comparing this
expression to the Gabor wavelet fitting formula without this effect, we find
that there is a shift in the travel times, that is introduced by the amplitude
modulation. The analytical model presented in this paper can be useful also for
interpretation of travel time measurements for non-uniform distribution of
oscillation amplitude due to observational effects.

technometric. The paper employs this triangulation strategy to examine the
current state of the innovation systems of South Korea and the Netherlands.
These indicators are thereafter used for the evaluation of the systemness in
configurations of university-industry-government relations. South Korea is
becoming somewhat stronger than the Netherlands in terms of scientific and
technological outputs and in terms of the knowledge-based dynamics; South
Korea's portfolio is more traditional than that of the Netherlands. For
example, research and patenting in the biomedical sector is underdeveloped. In
terms of the Internet-economy, the Netherlands seem oriented towards global
trends more than South Korea; this may be due to the high component of services

interactions with specific lattice bonds are studied theoretically with the
help of discrete-state stochastic ""burnt-bridge"" models. Molecular motors are
depicted as random walkers that can destroy or rebuild periodically distributed
weak connections (""bridges"") when crossing them, with probabilities $p_1$ and
$p_2$ correspondingly. Dynamic properties, such as velocities and dispersions,
are obtained in exact and explicit form for arbitrary values of parameters
$p_1$ and $p_2$. For the unbiased random walker, reversible burning of the
bridges results in a biased directed motion with a dynamic transition observed
at very small concentrations of bridges. In the case of backward biased
molecular motor its backward velocity is reduced and a reversal of the
direction of motion is observed for some range of parameters. It is also found
that the dispersion demonstrates a complex, non-monotonic behavior with large
fluctuations for some set of parameters. Complex dynamics of the system is
discussed by analyzing the behavior of the molecular motors near burned
bridges.

emergence of the objective, classical world from the quantum substrate. The key
to this emergence is the proliferation of redundant information throughout the
environment where observers can then intercept it. We study this process for a
purely decohering interaction when the environment, E, is in a non-ideal (e.g.,
mixed) initial state. In the case of good decoherence, that is, after the
pointer states have been unambiguously selected, the mutual information between
the system, S, and an environment fragment, F, is given solely by F's entropy
increase. This demonstrates that the environment's capacity for recording the
state of S is directly related to its ability to increase its entropy.
Environments that remain nearly invariant under the interaction with S, either
because they have a large initial entropy or a misaligned initial state,
therefore have a diminished ability to acquire information. To elucidate the
concept of good decoherence, we show that - when decoherence is not complete -
the deviation of the mutual information from F's entropy change is quantified
by the quantum discord, i.e., the excess mutual information between S and F is
information regarding the initial coherence between pointer states of S. In
addition to illustrating these results with a single qubit system interacting
with a multi-qubit environment, we find scaling relations for the redundancy of
information acquired by the environment that display a universal behavior
independent of the initial state of S. Our results demonstrate that Quantum
Darwinism is robust with respect to non-ideal initial states of the
environment: the environment almost always acquires redundant information about
the system but its rate of acquisition can be reduced.

dipole charge-which is not a conserved charge-is the new, distinguished
ingredient that highlights difference between the present theorem and the
corresponding theorem for vacuum case, as well as difference from the case of
topologically spherical horizon within the same minimal supergravity. We also
consider a similar boundary value problem for other topologically non-trivial

efficient numerical algorithms for finding the optimal design, and analytic
results for the case of 'minimal tomography'. We also introduce the average
OED, which is independent of the state to be reconstructed, and the optimal
design for tomography (ODT), which minimizes tomographic bias. We find that
these two designs are generally similar. Monte-Carlo simulations confirm the
utility of our results for qubits. Finally, we adapt our approach to deal with
constrained techniques such as maximum likelihood estimation. We find that
these are less amenable to optimization than cruder reconstruction methods,

compactification, starting from some general compact Einstein manifolds. The
proper vacua should be restricted by (i) a consistent worldsheet theory that

brane/flux configurations to cancel anomalies, and (iv) stabilities. We

special vacuum moduli.
  In an opposite way, if some field theory such as QCD holds an AdS dual, it
may also possesses various fundamental parameters by an ""landscape"" of its

walls. If the size of a single vacuum region is smaller than the visible

generalizing the standard Fermi liquid. This quantum liquid has specific
signatures in various physical properties, such as the Fermi surface volume and
the narrowing of electronic bands by spin and density correlation functions.
  We use Schwinger's source field idea to generate equations for the Greens
function for the Hubbard operators. A local (matrix) scale transformation in
the time domain to a quasiparticle Greens function, is found to be optimal.
This transformation allows us to generate vertex functions that are guaranteed
to reduce to the bare values for high frequencies, i.e. are ``asymptotically
free''. The quasiparticles are fractionally charged objects, and we find an
exact Schwinger Dyson equation for their Greens function. We find a hierarchy
of equations for the vertex functions, and further we obtain Ward identities so
that systematic approximations are feasible.
  An expansion in terms of the density of holes measured from the Mott Hubbard
insulating state follows from the nature of the theory. A systematic
presentation of the formalism is followed by some preliminary explicit
calculations.

Efforts to eliminate spurious results have enjoyed some success by using the

Recent asteroseismic studies have claimed models on the main sequence, as well
as in the expansion phase of the post-main sequence evolution. However, these
models could not reproduce all of the observed frequencies, the mode
instability range, and the fundamental stellar parameters simultaneously. A
recent photometric study has increased the number of detected independent modes
in 44 Tau to 15, and a newly found gravity mode at 5.30 c/d extends the
observed frequency range.
  Aims. One of the possible evolutionary stages of 44 Tau has not yet been
considered: the overall contraction phase after the main sequence. We computed
asteroseismic models to examine whether models in this evolutionary stage
provide a better fit of the observed frequency spectrum.
  Methods. We used Dziembowski's pulsation code to compute nonadiabatic
frequencies of radial and nonradial modes. Observation of two radial modes and
an avoided crossing of dipole modes put strong constraints on the models. A
two-parametric overshooting routine is utilized to determine the efficiency of
element mixing in the overshoot layer above the convective core.
  Results. We find that pulsation models in the post-MS contraction phase
successfully reproduce the observed frequency range, as well as the frequency
values of all individual radial and nonradial modes. The theoretical
frequencies of the mixed modes at 7.79 c/d and 9.58 c/d are in better agreement
with the observations if efficient element mixing in a small overshoot layer is
assumed.

coefficients $A_0$ that are independent of the coordinate transversal to the
boundary, in the Carleson sense $\|A-A_0\|_C$ defined by Dahlberg. We obtain a
number of {\em a priori} estimates and boundary behaviour results under
finiteness of $\|A-A_0\|_C$. Our methods yield full characterization of weak
solutions, whose gradients have $L_2$ estimates of a non-tangential maximal
function or of the square function, via an integral representation acting on
the conormal gradient, with a singular operator-valued kernel. Also, the
non-tangential maximal function of a weak solution is controlled in $L_2$ by
the square function of its gradient. This estimate is new for systems in such
generality, and even for real non-symmetric equations in dimension 3 or higher.
The existence of a proof {\em a priori} to well-posedness, is also a new fact.
As corollaries, we obtain well-posedness of the Dirichlet, Neumann and
Dirichlet regularity problems under smallness of $\|A-A_0\|_C$ and
well-posedness for $A_0$, improving earlier results for real symmetric
equations. Our methods build on an algebraic reduction to a first order system

to use functional calculus related to the Kato conjecture solution, and the
main analytic tool for coefficients $A$ is an operational calculus to prove

three-dimensional deflagration model for type Ia supernovae, the intermittency
of the turbulent velocity field and its implications on the probability of a
deflagration-to-detonation (DDT) transition are investigated. From structure
functions of the turbulent velocity fluctuations, we determine intermittency
parameters based on the log-normal and the log-Poisson models. On the other
hand, the analysis of the turbulent velocity fluctuations in the vicinity of
the flame front by Roepke suggests a much higher probability of large velocity
fluctuations on the grid scale in comparison to the log-normal intermittency
model. Following Pan et al., we computed probability density functions for a
DDT for the different distributions. Assuming that a DDT can occur in the
stirred flame regime, as proposed by Woosley et al., the log-normal model would
imply a delayed detonation between 0.7 and 0.8 seconds after the beginning of
the deflagration phase for the multi-spot ignition scenario used in the
simulation. However, the probability drops to virtually zero if a DDT is
further constrained by the requirement that the turbulent velocity fluctuations
reach about 500 km/s. Under this condition, delayed detonations are only
possible if the distribution of the velocity fluctuations is not log-normal.
  From our calculations follows that the distribution obtained by Roepke allow
for multiple DDTs around 0.8 seconds after ignition at a transition density
close to 1x10^7 g/cm^3.

YBa2Cu3O7/La(1-x)Ca(x)MnO3 superlattices is revealed by performing
first-principle electronic structure calculation using fully-relativistic
spin-polarized linear muffin-tin orbital and projected augmented plane wave
methods. We show that the XMCD spectra at the Cu L2,3 edges are proportional to
the difference of the densities of majority- and minority-spin Cu 3z2-1 states.
Although the Cu 3z2-1 states lie well below the Fermi level, a small number of
majority-spin 3z2-1 holes is created by the Cu 3z2-1 - O p_z - Mn 3z2-1
hybridization across the interface. Even this tiny number of holes is
sufficient to produce appreciable Cu L2,3 XMCD. The robustness of this
conclusion is verified by studying the influence of doping, atomic relaxation,
correlation effects, and antiferromagnetic order in a CuO2 plane on the XMCD
spectra.

of a graph $G$ with respect to $\mP$ is the minimal $r$ for which there exists
of a subgraph $H\subseteq G$ with all degrees at most $r$ such that the removal
of the edges of $H$ from $G$ creates a graph that does not possesses $\mP$.
This notion, which was implicitly studied for some ad-hoc properties, was
recently treated in a more systematic way in a paper by Sudakov and Vu. Most
research conducted with respect to this distance notion focused on the Binomial
random graph model $\GNP$ and some families of pseudo-random graphs with
respect to several graph properties such as containing a perfect matching and
being Hamiltonian, to name a few. In this paper we continue to explore the
local resilience notion, but turn our attention to random and pseudo-random
\emph{regular} graphs of constant degree. We investigate the local resilience
of the typical random $d$-regular graph with respect to edge and vertex
connectivity, containing a perfect matching, and being Hamiltonian. In
particular we prove that for every positive $\epsilon$ and large enough values
of $d$ with high probability the local resilience of the random $d$-regular
graph, $\GND$, with respect to being Hamiltonian is at least $(1-\epsilon)d/6$.
We also prove that for the Binomial random graph model $\GNP$, for every
positive $\epsilon>0$ and large enough values of $K$, if $p>\frac{K\ln n}{n}$
then with high probability the local resilience of $\GNP$ with respect to being
Hamiltonian is at least $(1-\epsilon)np/6$. Finally, we apply similar
techniques to Positional Games and prove that if $d$ is large enough then with
high probability a typical random $d$-regular graph $G$ is such that in the
unbiased Maker-Breaker game played on the edges of $G$, Maker has a winning
strategy to create a Hamilton cycle.

proceed to study this transition using a microscopic chaos indicator called the
\emph{Smaller Alignment Index} (SALI), which utilizes two deviation vectors in
the tangent dynamics of the flow and is nearly constant for ordered
(quasi--periodic) orbits, while it decays exponentially to zero for chaotic
orbits as $\exp(-(\lambda_{1}-\lambda_{2})t)$, where
$\lambda_{1}>\lambda_{2}>0$ are the two largest Lyapunov exponents. During the

$\Delta\lambda=\lambda_{1}-\lambda_{2}$ variations in that regime and helps us
identify the energy range over which ""melting"" occurs as a multi--stage
diffusion process through weakly chaotic layers in the phase space of the
microplasma. Additional evidence supporting further the above findings is given
by examining the $GALI_{k}$ indices, which generalize SALI (=$GALI_{2}$) to the

contrasting methods by which gas can flow into the central tens of parsecs. Gas
accumulation in this region will inevitably lead to a starburst, and we discuss
the evidence for such events. We then turn to the impact of stellar evolution
on the further inflow of gas by combining a phenomenological approach with
analytical modelling and hydrodynamic simulations. These complementary
perspectives paint a picture in which all the processes are ultimately
regulated by the mass accretion rate into the central hundred parsecs, and the
ensuing starburst that occurs there. The resulting supernovae delay accretion
by generating a starburst wind, which leaves behind a clumpy interstellar
medium. This provides an ideal environment for slower stellar outflows to
accrete inwards and form a dense turbulent disk on scales of a few parsecs.
Such a scenario may resolve the discrepancy between the larger scale structure
seen with adaptive optics and the small scale structure seen with VLTI.

performance improvements, and is, therefore, attracting considerable attention.
While several criteria have been proposed for selecting one or more relays,
distributed mechanisms that perform the selection have received relatively less
attention. In this paper, we develop a novel, yet simple, asymptotic analysis
of a splitting-based multiple access selection algorithm to find the single
best relay. The analysis leads to simpler and alternate expressions for the
average number of slots required to find the best user. By introducing a new
`contention load' parameter, the analysis shows that the parameter settings
used in the existing literature can be improved upon. New and simple bounds are
also derived. Furthermore, we propose a new algorithm that addresses the
general problem of selecting the best $Q \ge 1$ relays, and analyze and
optimize it. Even for a large number of relays, the algorithm selects the best
two relays within 4.406 slots and the best three within 6.491 slots, on
average. We also propose a new and simple scheme for the practically relevant
case of discrete metrics. Altogether, our results develop a unifying
perspective about the general problem of distributed selection in cooperative
systems and several other multi-node systems.

sufficiently hot to excite PAHs. To explain the deficiency, we discuss PAH
destruction by photons assuming that the star has beside its photospheric
emission also a FUV, an EUV and an X-ray component with fractional luminosity
of 1%, 0.1% and 0.025%, respectively. As PAH destruction process we consider
unimolecular dissociation and present a simplified scheme to estimate the
location from the star where the molecules become photo-stable. We find that
soft photons with energies below ~20eV dissociate PAHs only up to short
distances from the star (r < 1AU); whereas dissociation by hard photons (EUV
and X-ray) is so efficient that it would destroy all PAHs (from regions in the
disk where they could be excited). As a possible path for PAH survival we
suggest turbulent motions in the disk. They can replenish PAHs or remove them
from the reach of hard photons. For standard disk models, where the surface
density changes like 1/r and the mid plane temperature like 1/r^{0.5}, the
critical vertical velocity for PAH survival is proportional to r^{-3/4} and
equals ~5m/s at 10AU which is in the range of expected velocities in the
surface layer. The uncertainty in the parameters is large enough to explain
both detection and non-detection of PAHs. Our approximate treatment also takes
into account the presence of gas which, at the top of the disk, is ionized and
at lower levels neutral.

visibilities and 432 closure phases, they result in the best (u,v) coverage
achieved on a young star so far. The circumstellar material is resolved at the
sub-AU spatial scale and closure phase measurements indicate a small but
significant deviation from point-symmetry. We discuss the results assuming that
the near-infrared excess in HD163296 is dominated by the emission of a
circumstellar disk. A successful fit to the spectral energy distribution,
near-infrared visibilities and closure phases is found with a model where a
dominant contribution to the H and K band emissions arises from an optically
thin, smooth and point-symmetric region extending from about 0.1 to 0.45 AU. At
the latter distance from the star, silicates condense, the disk becomes
optically thick and develops a puffed-up rim, whose skewed emission can account
for the non-zero closure phases. We discuss the nature of the inner disk
emission and tentatively rule out dense molecular gas as well as optically thin
atomic or ionized gas as its possible origin. We propose instead that the inner
emission traces the presence of very refractory grains in a partially cleared
region, extending at least to 0.5 AU. If so, we may be observing the disk of
HD163296 just before it reaches the transition disk phase. However, we note
that the nature of the refractory grains or even the possibility for any grain
to survive at the very high temperatures we require (~2100-2300 K at 0.1 AU
from the star) is unclear and should be investigated further.

peculiar abundance patterns compared to those of nominal Milky Way (MW) stars.
The overall [Ti/Fe], [Y/Fe], [La/Fe] and [La/Y] patterns with [Fe/H] of the Sgr
stream plus Sgr core do resemble those seen in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)

the other dSphs; these relative shifts reflect the faster and/or more efficient
chemical evolution of Sgr compared to the other satellites, and show that Sgr
has had an enrichment history more like the LMC than the other dSphs. By
tracking the evolution of the abundance patterns along the Sgr stream we can
follow the time variation of the chemical make-up of dSph stars donated to the
MW halo by Sgr. This evolution demonstrates that while the bulk of the stars
currently in the Sgr dSph are quite unlike those of the MW halo, an increasing
number of stars farther along the Sgr stream have abundances like MW halo
stars, a trend that shows clearly how the MW halo could have been contributed
by present day satellite galaxies even if the present chemistry of those
satellites is now different from typical halo field stars. Finally, we analyze
the chemical abundances of a moving group of M giants among the Sgr leading arm
stars at the North Galactic Cap, but having radial velocities unlike the
infalling Sgr leading arm debris there. Through use of ""chemical
fingerprinting"", we conclude that these northern hemisphere M giants also are
Sgr stars, likely trailing arm debris overlapping the leading arm in the north.

system, suitable for the fabrication of qubits and quantum logic elements. A
random noise term is added to the hamiltonian, the resulting wavefunction found
numerically and the density matrix obtained by averaging over noise signals.
Analytic solutions using the two-state model are obtained and found to be
generally in agreement.
  In particular, a simple formula for the decoherence rate in terms of the
noise parameters in the two-state model is reviewed and verified for the full
simulation with the multi-level system. The formalism is extended to describe
multiple sources of noise or different ""dephasing"" axes at the same time.
Furthermore, the old formula for the ""Turing-Watched Pot"" effect is generalized
to the case where the environmental interactions do not conserve the ""quality""
in question.
  Various forms for the noise signal are investigated. An interesting result is
the importance of the noise power at low frequency. If it vanishes there is, in
leading order, no decoherence. This is verified in a numerical simulation where
two apparently similar noise signals, but differing in the power at zero
frequency, give strikingly different decoherence effects. A short discussion of
situations dominated by low frequency noise is given.

Halo star had been detected in CO before this work. Infrared observations show
that these stars are red (J-K $>$3), due to the presence of large dusty
circumstellar envelopes. Radiative transfer models indicates that these stars
are losing mass with rather large dust mass-loss rates in the range 1--3.3
$\times$$10^{-8}$M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, similar to what can be observed in the
Galactic disc. We show that two of these stars are effectively in the Halo, one
is likely linked to the stream of the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal galaxy (Sgr
dSph), and the other three stars certainly belong to the thick disc. The wind
expansion velocities of the observed stars are low compared to carbon stars in
the thin disc and are lower for the stars in the Halo and the Sgr dSph stream
than in the thick disc. We discuss the possibility that the low expansion
velocities result from the low metallicity of the Halo carbon stars. This
implies that metal-poor carbon stars lose mass at a rate similar to metal-rich
carbon stars, but with lower expansion velocities, as predicted by recent
theoretical models. This result implies that the current estimates of mass-loss
rates from carbon stars in Local Group galaxies will have to be reconsidered.

environments (like cluster environments) seem to suppress AGN activity. The
pair fraction of HII REGs does not show statistically significant difference

$\mathcal{F}(R,G)$-gravity, where $R$ and $G$ are the Ricci scalar and the
Gauss-Bonnet invariant, respectively. As an explicit example of
$\mathcal{F}(R,G)$-gravity, we also investigate modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity,
so-called $F(G)$-gravity. In particular, we reconstruct the $F(G)$-gravity and
$\mathcal{F}(R,G)$-gravity models where accelerating cosmologies realizing the
finite-time future singularities emerge. Furthermore, we discuss a possible way
to cure the finite-time future singularities in $F(G)$-gravity and
$\mathcal{F}(R,G)$-gravity by taking into account higher-order curvature
corrections. The example of non-singular realistic modified Gauss-Bonnet
gravity is presented. It turns out that adding such non-singular modified
gravity to singular Dark Energy makes the combined theory to be non-singular
one as well.

environmental perturbations as if of one mind. Most studies in collective
animal behaviour have aimed to understand how a globally ordered state may
emerge from simple behavioural rules. Less effort has been devoted to
understanding the origin of collective response, namely the way the group as a
whole reacts to its environment. Yet collective response is the adaptive key to
survivor, especially when strong predatory pressure is present. Here we argue
that collective response in animal groups is achieved through scale-free
behavioural correlations. By reconstructing the three-dimensional position and
velocity of individual birds in large flocks of starlings, we measured to what
extent the velocity fluctuations of different birds are correlated to each
other. We found that the range of such spatial correlation does not have a
constant value, but it scales with the linear size of the flock. This result
indicates that behavioural correlations are scale-free: the change in the
behavioural state of one animal affects and is affected by that of all other
animals in the group, no matter how large the group is. Scale-free correlations
extend maximally the effective perception range of the individuals, thus
compensating for the short-range nature of the direct inter-individual
interaction and enhancing global response to perturbations. Our results suggest
that flocks behave as critical systems, poised to respond maximally to
environmental perturbations.

highly proficient computer networks. Among these, the centralized networks have
one component that is shared by users all the time. All resources are
accessible, but there is a single point of control as well as a single point of

new paradigm of computing called distributed computing in the late 1970s.
Distributed computing has changed the face of computing and offered quick and
precise solutions for a variety of complex problems for different fields.
Nowadays, we are fully engrossed by the information age, and expending more
time communicating and gathering information through the Internet. The Internet
keeps on progressing along more than a few magnitudes, abiding end systems
increasingly to communicate in more and more different ways. Over the years,
several methods have evolved to enable these developments, ranging from
simplistic data sharing to advanced systems supporting a multitude of services.
This article provides an overview of distributed computing systems. The

magnetic flux on time scales of years to millenia. In the model employed here
the evolution of the solar total and open magnetic flux is computed from the
flux emerging at the solar surface in the form of bipolar magnetic features,
which is related to the sunspot number cycle parameters and can be estimated
from historical records. Compared to earlier versions of the model in addition
to the long-lived open flux, now also a more rapidly decaying component of the
open flux is considered. The model parameters are constrained by comparing its
output with observations of the total surface magnetic flux and with a
reconstruction of the open magnetic flux based on the geomagnetic indexes. A
method to compute the Sun's total magnetic flux and the sunspot number during
the Holocene, starting from the open flux obtained from cosmogenic isotopes
records, is also presented. By considering separately a rapdly evolving and a
slowly evolving component of the open flux the model reproduces the Sun's open
flux, as reconstructed based on the aa-index, much better and a reasonable
description of the radial component of interplanetary magnetic field data are
obtained. The greatest improvement is in the reproduction of the cyclic
variation of the open flux, including the amplitudes of individual cycles.
Furthermore, we found that approximately 25% of the modeled open flux values
since the end of the Maunder Minimum are lower than the averaged value during
the current low minimum. The same proportion is observed in reconstructions of
the open flux during the Holocene based on cosmogenic isotopes, which suggests
that the present solar minimum conditions are below average, but not
exceptional in terms of the magnetic flux.

detected in young and massive superstar clusters are discussed. We suggest that
these arise from a collection of repressurizing shocks (RSs), acting
effectively to re-establish pressure balance within the cluster volume and from
the cluster wind which leads to an even broader although much weaker component.
The supersonic lines are here shown to occur in clusters that undergo a bimodal
hydrodynamic solution (Tenorio-Tagle et al. 2007), that is within clusters that
are above the threshold line in the mechanical luminosity or cluster mass vs
the size of the cluster (Silich et al. 2004). The plethora of repressurizing
shocks is due to frequent and recurrent thermal instabilities that take place
within the matter reinserted by stellar winds and supernovae. We show that the
maximum speed of the RSs and of the cluster wind, are both functions of the
temperature reached at the stagnation radius. This temperature depends only on
the cluster heating efficiency ($\eta$). Based on our two dimensional
simulations (Wunsch et al. 2008) we calculate the line profiles that result
from several models and confirm our analytical predictions. From a comparison
between the predicted and observed values of the half-width zero intensity of
the two line components we conclude that the thermalization efficiency in SSC's
above the threshold line must be lower than 20%.

weakening and broadening of the perturbation profile, which is con- sistent
with a disturbance first driven and then evolving into a freely propagating

measured SAR is 280 W/g at 300 kHz and 66 mT. Specific absorption rate (SAR)
displays a square dependence with the magnetic field below 30 mT but deviates
from this power law at higher value. SAR is linear with the applied frequency

visibilities show a strong wavelength dependence. The H-band images display two
bright spots whose positions are confirmed by the geometrical toy model. The
inhomogeneities are qualitatively predicted by 3D simulations. At about 2,00
micron and in the region 2,35 - 2,50 micron, the photosphere appears extended
and the radius is larger than in the H band. In this spectral region, the
geometrical toy model locates a third bright spot outside the photosphere that
can be a feature of the molecular layers. The wavelength dependence of the
visibility can be qualitatively explained by 1D dynamical models of Mira
atmospheres. The best-fitting photospheric models show a good match with the
observed visibilities and give a photospheric diameter of theta = 8,82+-0,50
mas. The H2O molecule seems to be the dominant absorber in the molecular
layers. Conclusions. We show that the atmosphere of VX Sgr rather resembles

see molecular (water) layers that are typical for Mira stars.

Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Most practical communication links are bi-directional. In these models, since
the source node also receives signals, its encoder has the option of computing
its output based on the signals it received in the past. On the other hand,
from a practical point of view, it would also be desirable to identify the
cases where such an encoder design may not improve communication rates. This
question is particularly interesting for the case where the transmitted
messages and the feedback signals are subject to eavesdropping. In this work,
we investigate the question of how much impact the feedback has on the secrecy
capacity by studying two fundamental models. First, we consider the Gaussian
two-way wiretap channel and derive an outer bound for its secrecy capacity
region. We show that the secrecy rate loss can be unbounded when feedback
signals are not utilized except for a special case we identify, and thus
conclude that utilizing feedback can be highly beneficial in general. Second,
we consider a half-duplex Gaussian two-way relay channel where the relay node
is also an eavesdropper, and find that the impact of feedback is less
pronounced compared to the previous scenario. Specifically, the loss in secrecy
rate, when ignoring the feedback, is quantified to be less than 0.5 bit per
channel use when the relay power goes to infinity. This achievable rate region
is obtained with simple time sharing along with cooperative jamming, which,
with its simplicity and near optimum performance, is a viable alternative to an
encoder that utilizes feedback signals.
