dust content of galaxies and their observed spectral energy distributions. In
the present work we perform a comprehensive calibration of our own flexible SPS
(FSPS) model against a suite of data. Several public SPS models are
intercompared, including the models of Bruzual & Charlot (BC03), Maraston (M05)
and FSPS. The relative strengths and weaknesses of these models are evaluated,
with the following conclusions: 1) The FSPS and BC03 models compare favorably
with MC data at all ages, whereas M05 colors are too red and the age-dependence
is incorrect; 2) All models yield similar optical and near-IR colors for old
metal-poor systems, and yet they all provide poor fits to the integrated J-K
and V-K colors of both MW and M31 star clusters; 4) All models predict ugr
colors too red, D4000 strengths too strong and Hdelta strengths too weak
compared to massive red sequence galaxies, under the assumption that such
galaxies are composed solely of old metal-rich stars; 5) FSPS and, to a lesser
extent, BC03 can reproduce the optical and near-IR colors of post-starburst
galaxies, while M05 cannot. Reasons for these discrepancies are explored. The
failure at predicting the ugr colors, D4000, and Hdelta strengths can be
explained by some combination of a minority population of metal-poor stars,
young stars, blue straggler and/or blue horizontal branch stars, but not by
appealing to inadequacies in either theoretical stellar atmospheres or
canonical evolutionary phases (e.g., the main sequence turn-off). We emphasize
that due to a lack of calibrating star cluster data in regions of the
metallicity-age plane relevant for galaxies, all of these models continue to
suffer from serious uncertainties that are difficult to quantify. (ABRIDGED)

what is not excluded by the oscillation experiments performed up to now. A
simple model realizing such a scenario can be obtained adding right-handed
neutrinos to the minimal Standard Model, together with an extra scalar doublet

reduced by a factor of ~3, and the Yukawa couplings must be adequately chosen.
This is also generically required if lepton flavour violation must be below

discussion involves CFTs with different central charges whose description, in
the gravity side, requires the inclusion of quadratic curvature corrections. It
is enough, indeed, to consider the Gauss-Bonnet term. We find that both sides
of the AdS/CFT correspondence impose a restriction on the Gauss-Bonnet
coupling. In the case of 6d supersymmetric CFTs, we show the full matching of
these restrictions. We perform this computation in two ways. First by
considering a thermal setup in a black hole background. Second by scrutinizing
the scattering of gravitons with a shock wave in AdS. The different helicities
provide the corresponding lower and upper bounds. We generalize these results
to arbitrary higher dimensions and comment on some hints and puzzles they
prompt regarding the possible existence of higher dimensional CFTs and the
extent to which the AdS/CFT correspondence would be valid for them.

symmetric functions. We consider a collocated network, where each node's
transmissions can be heard by every other node. Each node has a Boolean
measurement and we wish to compute a given Boolean function of these
measurements with zero error. We allow for block computation to enhance data
fusion efficiency, and determine the minimum worst-case total bits to be
communicated to perform the desired computation. We restrict attention to the
class of symmetric Boolean functions, which only depend on the number of 1s
among the n measurements.
  We define three classes of functions, namely threshold functions, delta
functions and interval functions. We provide exactly optimal strategies for the
first two classes, and an order-optimal strategy with optimal preconstant for
interval functions. Using these results, we can characterize the complexity of
computing percentile type functions, which is of great interest. In our
analysis, we use lower bounds from communication complexity theory, and provide
an achievable scheme using information theoretic tools.

for Seyfert galaxies: instead of the type 1 and 2 classes, we use the
spectropolarimetric data to divide them into ""AGN 1"" and ""AGN 2"", where AGN 1's
include all broad-line objects, including the Seyfert 2's showing hidden broad
lines in polarized light, while AGN 2's contains only Seyferts with no
detectable broad lines at all. We present various mid-IR observables and we
find that these properties characterize the AGN 1's objects as a single family,
with strongly AGN-dominated spectra. In contrast, the AGN 2's can be divided in
two groups, the first one with properties similar to the AGN 1's and the second
similar to the non-Seyfert galaxies, such as LINERs or starburst galaxies. We
computed a semianalytical model to estimate the AGN and the starburst
contributions to the mid-IR galaxy emission at 19um. We find that AGN 1 have an
AGN contribution >73% and AGN 2 >45% of their total emission at 19um. The
detection of [NeV] lines is an almost perfect signature of energy production by
an AGN. We present mean spectra of the various AGN categories. We derive the
first local luminosity functions for the mid-infrared lines and the PAH
feature. No statistical difference is found in the space densities for Seyfert
1's and 2's, nor for the new classes of AGN 1's and 2's. The global output of
accretion-powered galactic nuclei in the local universe is derived from the
correlation between [NeV] line and the nonstellar IR continuum luminosity.

their environment over time, communicate with each other over a wireless
network, and process information. They differ from data networks in that the
network as a whole may be designed for a specific application. We study the
theoretical foundations of such large scale sensor networks, addressing four
fundamental issues- connectivity, capacity, clocks and function computation.
  To begin with, a sensor network must be connected so that information can
indeed be exchanged between nodes. The connectivity graph of an ad-hoc network
is modeled as a random graph and the critical range for asymptotic connectivity
is determined, as well as the critical number of neighbors that a node needs to
connect to. Next, given connectivity, we address the issue of how much data can
be transported over the sensor network. We present fundamental bounds on
capacity under several models, as well as architectural implications for how
wireless communication should be organized.
  Temporal information is important both for the applications of sensor
networks as well as their operation.We present fundamental bounds on the
synchronizability of clocks in networks, and also present and analyze
algorithms for clock synchronization. Finally we turn to the issue of gathering
relevant information, that sensor networks are designed to do. One needs to
study optimal strategies for in-network aggregation of data, in order to
reliably compute a composite function of sensor measurements, as well as the
complexity of doing so. We address the issue of how such computation can be
performed efficiently in a sensor network and the algorithms for doing so, for
some classes of functions.

the consistency condition for a pair of linear differential equations with 2 by
2 matrix coefficients with rational entries. By a construction due to Tracy and
Widom, this linear system is associated with certain kernels which give trace
class operators on Hilbert space. This paper expresses such operators in terms
of the Hankel operators \Gamma_\phi of linear systems which are realised in
terms of the Laurent coefficients of the solutions of the differential
equations. Let P_{(t infty)}:L^2(0, \infty)\to L^2(t, \infty) be the orthogonal
projection. For such, the Fredholm determinant \tau (t)=det (I-P_{(t,

of the solutions of a matrix Gelfand--Levitan equation. For suitable paramters,
solutions of the hypergeometric equation give a linear system with similar
properties. For meromorphic transfer functions \hat\phi that have poles on an
arithmetic progression, the corresponding Hankel operator has a simple form
with respect to an exponential basis in L^2(0, \infty); so \tau (t) can be
expressed in terms of finite determinants. This applies to elliptic functions

extended our survey to higher Galactic longitudes. We find no evidence for an

included in spectral analyses by assuming optically thin clumps, a void
inter-clump medium, and a smooth velocity field. To reconcile investigations of
different diagnostics within such models, a highly clumped wind with very low
mass-loss rates needs to be invoked. Particularly, unsaturated UV resonance
lines seem to indicate rates an order of magnitude (or even more) lower than
previously accepted values. We investigate resonance line formation in
inhomogeneous hot star winds with non-monotonic velocity fields by means of 2D
stochastic and pseudo-2D radiation-hydrodynamic wind models. A Monte-Carlo
radiative transfer code is presented and used to produce synthetic line
spectra. Results: The optically thin clumping limit is only valid for very weak
lines. For intermediate strong lines, the velocity spans of the clumps are of
central importance. Current hydrodynamical models predict spans that are too
large to reproduce observed profiles unless a very low mass-loss rate is
invoked. By simulating lower spans in 2D stochastic models, the profile
strengths become drastically reduced, and are consistent with higher mass-loss
rates. To simultaneously meet the constraints from strong lines, the
inter-clump medium must be non-void. A first comparison to the observed PV
doublet in the O6 supergiant lam Cep confirms that a stochastic 2D model
reproduces observations with a mass-loss rate roughly ten times higher than
that derived from the same lines but assuming optically thin clumping.
Tentatively this may resolve discrepancies between theoretical predictions,
evolutionary constraints, and recent derived mass-loss rates, and suggests a
re-investigation of the structure predicted by current hydrodynamical models.

term accounting for the strain of space-time viewed as a four-dimensional
physical continuum. In this framework the Ricci scalar acts as the kinetical
term of the strain field whose potential is represented by the additional
terms. Here we are presenting the linearised version of the theory in order to
analyze its implications in the weak field limit. First we discuss the recovery
of the Newtonian limit. We find that the typical static weak field limit
imposes a constraint on the values of the two parameters (Lame coefficients) of
the theory. Once the constraint has been implemented, the typical gravitational
potential turns out to be Yukawa-like. The value for the Yukawa parameter is
consistent with the constraints coming from the experimental data at the Solar
system and galactic scales. We then come to the propagating solutions of the
linearised Einstein equations in vacuo, i.e. to gravitational waves. Here,
analogously with other alternative or extended theories of gravity, the
presence of the strain field produces massive waves, where massive (in this
completely classical context) means subluminal. Furthermore longitudinal
polarization modes are allowed too, thus lending, in principle, a way for
discriminating these waves from the plane GR ones.

linearize equations of internal waves generation and propagation. It is shown
that in interesting for us wavelength range we can use linear approximation
during study of internal gravity waves dynamics. Similarly it is easy to
evaluate also influence of other corrections to the linear theory of internal

adequacy and supportability of linear model wave dynamics.

Universe. We find that, due to chemical enrichment of the inter-stellar medium
by isolated Population III stars formed in mini-halos at redshift z>30, the
(chronologically) first galaxies are composed of metal-poor Population II stars
and are highly clustered on small scales. In contrast, chemically pristine
galaxies in halos with mass M~10^8 M_sun may form at z<20 in relatively
underdense regions of the Universe. This occurs once self-enrichment by
Population III in mini-halos is quenched by the build-up of an $H_2$
photo-dissociating radiative background in the Lyman-Werner bands. We find that
these chemically pristine galaxies are spatially uncorrelated. Thus, we expect
that deep fields with the James Webb Space Telescope may detect clusters of
chemically enriched galaxies but individual chemically pristine objects. We
predict that metal-free galaxies at 10 <= z <= 15$ have surface densities of
about 80 per square arcmin and per unit redshift but most of them will be too
faint even for JWST. However, the predicted density makes these objects
interesting targets for searches behind lensing clusters.

increases with radius, varying from ~100 in the nucleus to ~400 at 5.5 kpc. The

better constrain the cosmic distance ladder. A project was started in 1999 to
firmly establish a direct and accurate distance to M31 using eclipsing binaries
(EBs). After the determination of the first direct distance to M31 from EBs,
the second direct distance to an EB system is presented:
M31V_J00443610+4129194. Light and radial velocity curves were obtained and
fitted to derive the masses and radii of the components. The acquired spectra
were combined and disentangled to determine the temperature of the components.
The analysis of the studied EB resulted in a distance determination to M31 of
(m-M)o = 24.30 +/- 0.11 mag. This result, when combined with the previous
distance determination to M31, results in a distance modulus of (m-M)o = 24.36

determinations to M31. With an error of only 4%, the obtained value firmly
establishes the distance to this important galaxy and represents the

provides stellar masses in agreement with those inferred by lensing and

underestimates them (<\log \alpha>=0.25+-0.03+-0.02). A tentative trend is
found, in the sense that \alpha appears to increase with galaxy velocity
dispersion. Taken at face value, this result would imply a non universal IMF,
perhaps dependent on metallicity, age, or abundance ratios of the stellar
populations. Alternatively, the observed trend may imply non-universal dark

that for the broad range of initial conditions we have studied the stellar mass
function of these systems presents a universal evolution which depends only on
the fractional mass loss. The structure of the system, as measured by the core
to half mass radius ratio, also evolves toward a universal state, which is set
by the efficiency of heating on the visible population of stars induced by
dynamical interactions in the core of the system. Interactions with dark
remnants are dominant over the heating induced by a moderate population of
primordial binaries (3-5%), especially under the assumption that most of the
neutron stars and black holes are retained in the system. All our models
without primordial binaries undergo a deep gravothermal collapse in the radial
mass profile. However their projected light distribution can be well fitted by
medium concentration King models (with parameter W0 ~ 8), even though there
tends to be an excess over the best fit for the innermost points of the surface
brightness. This excess is consistent with a shallow cusp in the surface
brightness (mu(R) ~ R^{-v} with v ~ 0.4-0.7), like it has been observed for
many globular clusters from high-resolution HST imaging. Classification of
core-collapsed globular clusters based on their surface brightness profile is
likely to fail in systems that have already bounced back to lower

Although specific meanings can be stabilized, for example in social

Using Luhmann's (1984) social systems theory and Rosen's (1985) theory of
anticipatory systems, I submit algorithms for modeling the non-linear dynamics
of meaning in social systems. First, a self-referential system can use a model
of itself for the anticipation. Under the condition of functional
differentiation, the social system can be expected to entertain a set of
models; each model can also contain a model of the other models. Two
anticipatory mechanisms are then possible: a transversal one between the
models, and a longitudinal one providing the system with a variety of meanings.
A system containing two anticipatory mechanisms can become hyper-incursive.
Without making decisions, however, a hyper-incursive system would be overloaded
with uncertainty. Under this pressure, informed decisions tend to replace the
""natural preferences"" of agents and a knowledge-based order can increasingly be
shaped.

G333.6-0.2, we found a local [OIII] 88 micron emission peak, which is
indicative of an excitation source. This is supported by the 18 micron
continuum emission, which is considered to trace the hot dust distribution. For
all regions, the [CII] 158 micron emission is distributed widely as suggested
by previous observations of star-forming regions. We conclude that [OIII] 88
micron emission traces the excitation sources more accurately than the radio
continuum emission, especially where there is a high density and/or column
density gradient. The FIR spectroscopy provides a promising means of
understanding the nature of star-forming regions.

second-order accurate and the temporal discretization is based on the
dimensionally unsplit Corner Transport Upwind (CTU) method of Colella. The
proposed scheme employs a cell-centered representation of the primary fluid
variables (including magnetic field) and conserves mass, momentum, magnetic
induction and energy. A variant of the scheme, which breaks momentum and energy
conservation, is also considered. Divergence errors are transported out of the
domain and damped using the mixed hyperbolic/parabolic divergence cleaning
technique by Dedner et al. (J. Comput. Phys., 175, 2002). The strength and
accuracy of the scheme are verified by a direct comparison with the eight-wave
formulation (also employing a cell-centered representation) and with the
popular constrained transport method, where magnetic field components retain a
staggered collocation inside the computational cell. Results obtained from two-
and three-dimensional test problems indicate that the newly proposed scheme is
robust, accurate and competitive with recent implementations of the constrained
transport method while being considerably easier to implement in existing hydro
codes.

trigger the collapse of a 2.2 solar mass cloud while simultaneously injecting
shock wave material: lower speed shocks do not achieve injection, while higher
speed shocks do not trigger sustained collapse. The calculations continue to
support the shock-wave trigger hypothesis for the formation of the solar

characterize mathematically, and their generation must rely on an unpredictable
physical process. Inaccuracies in the theoretical modelling of such processes
or failures of the devices, possibly due to adversarial attacks, limit the
reliability of random number generators in ways that are difficult to control
and detect. Here, inspired by earlier work on nonlocality based and device
independent quantum information processing, we show that the nonlocal

of genuine randomness. It is thereby possible to design of a new type of
cryptographically secure random number generator which does not require any
assumption on the internal working of the devices. This strong form of
randomness generation is impossible classically and possible in quantum systems
only if certified by a Bell inequality violation. We carry out a

violation, featuring near-perfect detection efficiency, guarantees that 42 new

demonstrate that the reduced phase space path integral formulation formally

the equivalence can only be established by passing to Abelian(ised) constraints

density, protocols of quantum energy teleportation are proposed that transport
energy to distant sites by local operations and classical communication. The
energy is teleported without breaking any physical laws including causality and
local energy conservation. Because intermediate subsystems of the energy

attains energy transportation without heat generation in the channel. We
discuss the protocol focusing around qubit chains. In addition, we address a

via Dirac's operator constraint method proceeds by the thory of Rigged Hilbert
spaces, sometimes also called Refined Algebraic Quantisation (RAQ). This method
can work when the constraints form a Lie algebra. When the constraints only
close with nontrivial structure functions, the Rigging map can no longer be
defined.
  To overcome this obstacle, the Master Constraint Method has been proposed
which replaces the individual constraints by a weighted sum of absolute squares
of the constraints. Now the direct integral decomposition methods (DID), which
are closely related to Rigged Hilbert spaces, become available and have been
successfully tested in various situations.
  It is relatively straightforward to relate the Rigging Inner Product to the
path integral that one obtains via reduced phase space methods. However, for
the Master Constraint this is not at all obvious. In this paper we find
sufficient conditions under which such a relation can be established. Key to
our analysis is the possibility to pass to equivalent, Abelian constraints, at
least locally in phase space. Then the Master Constraint DID for those Abelian
constraints can be directly related to the Rigging Map and therefore has a path
integral formulation.

path-integral measure for the Palatini and Holst formulation of gravity, which
is different from the Lebesgue measure up to local measure factors which depend
on the spacetime volume element and spatial volume element.

new derivation of the Plebanski path integral and discover a discrepancy with

(perfect fluid representing spin 1/2 and 1 fields), the equations of general
relativity result in cosmological and gravitational collapse singularities--due
to the fulfilment of both the strong and weak energy conditions. According to
great unified theories, in superdense matter (both hot and cold), phase
transitions take place, symmetry between the strong and electroweak
interactions is restored/broken, and a scalar field is created/annihilated. In
the scalar field regime, the strong energy condition is broken, but the weak
one holds. However, the continuity condition for the pressure on the surface of
a contracting star results in the occurrence of a compensating pseudomatter
field, for which both energy conditions are broken. On this basis, for a
massive star predisposed to a gravitational collapse, a pulsation dynamics with
no singularity is constructed.

exploiting this potential can be challenging, as one must adapt to the

performance and productivity advantages over conventional single-tier, static

grooming problem for WDM ring networks introduced by Colbourn, Quattrocchi, and
Syrotiuk. In the two-period grooming problem, during the first period of time,
there is all-to-all uniform traffic among $n$ nodes, each request using $1/C$
of the bandwidth; and during the second period, there is all-to-all uniform
traffic only among a subset $V$ of $v$ nodes, each request now being allowed to
use $1/C'$ of the bandwidth, where $C' < C$. We determine the minimum drop cost
(minimum number of ADMs) for any $n,v$ and C=4 and $C' \in \{1,2,3\}$. To do
this, we use tools of graph decompositions. Indeed the two-period grooming
problem corresponds to minimizing the total number of vertices in a partition
of the edges of the complete graph $K_n$ into subgraphs, where each subgraph
has at most $C$ edges and where furthermore it contains at most $C'$ edges of
the complete graph on $v$ specified vertices. Subject to the condition that the
two-period grooming has the least drop cost, the minimum number of wavelengths
required is also determined in each case.

In an effort to interpret the existing numerical data on this observable, we
compute it at order O(alpha_s^2) in continuum, and analyze the result at
various distance scales. At short distances (r << 1/pi T) the behaviour matches
that of the gauge-independent zero-temperature potential; on the other hand at
large distances (r >> 1/pi T) the singlet free energy appears to have a

becomes physical in the sense that it goes over to a gauge-independent
disconnected contribution, the square of the expectation value of the trace of
the Polyakov loop; we recompute this quantity at O(alpha_s^2), finding for pure
SU(Nc) a different non-logarithmic term than in previous literature, and adding
for full QCD the quark contribution. We also discuss the value of the singlet
free energy in a general covariant gauge, as well as the behaviour of the
cyclic Wilson loop that is obtained if the singlet free energy is made
gauge-independent by inserting straight spacelike Wilson lines into the

Often, we are interested in complexity trends of these system as it evolves
under some dynamic. An example might be looking at the complexity of a food web
as species enter an ecosystem via migration or speciation, and leave via
extinction.
  In a previous paper, a complexity measure of networks was proposed based on
the {\em complexity is information content} paradigm. To apply this paradigm to
any object, one must fix two things: a representation language, in which
strings of symbols from some alphabet describe, or stand for the objects being
considered; and a means of determining when two such descriptions refer to the
same object. With these two things set, the information content of an object
can be computed in principle from the number of equivalent descriptions
describing a particular object.
  The previously proposed representation language had the deficiency that the
fully connected and empty networks were the most complex for a given number of
nodes. A variation of this measure, called zcomplexity, applied a compression
algorithm to the resulting bitstring representation, to solve this problem.
Unfortunately, zcomplexity proved too computationally expensive to be
practical.
  In this paper, I propose a new representation language that encodes the
number of links along with the number of nodes and a representation of the
linklist. This, like zcomplexity, exhibits minimal complexity for fully
connected and empty networks, but is as tractable as the original measure.

An independent calculation of the fluid elastic constants, within the same
theory, allows us to connect with the local free--energy density predicted by
elastic theory, which in turn provides a criterion to define a defect core
boundary and a defect core free energy for the two types of defects. The radial
and tangential defects turn out to have very different properties, a feature
that a previous Maier--Saupe theory could not account for due to the simplified
nature of the interactions --which caused all elastic constants to be equal. In
the case with two $k=+1/2$ defects in the cavity, the elastic r\'egime cannot
be reached due to the small radii of the cavities considered, but some trends
can already be obtained.

Each of the loop strands used in this model can independently be heated (near
their left footpoints) by Alfv\'en/ion-cyclotron waves via wave-particle
interactions. The Alfv\'en waves are assumed to penetrate the strands from
their footpoints, at which we consider different wave energy inputs. As a
result, the loop strands can have different heating profiles, and the
differential heating can lead to a varying cross-field temperature in the total
coronal loop. The simulation of TRACE observations by means of this loop model
implies two uniform temperatures along the loop length, one inferred from the
171:195 filter ratio and the other from the 171:284 ratio. The reproduced flat
temperature profiles are consistent with those inferred from the observed EUV
coronal loops. According to our model, the flat temperature profile is a
consequence of the coronal loop consisting of filaments, which have different
temperatures but almost similar emission measures in the cross-field direction.
Furthermore, when we assume certain errors in the simulated loop emissions
(e.g., due to photometric uncertainties in the TRACE filters) and use the
triple-filter analysis, our simulated loop conditions become consistent with
those of an isothermal plasma. This implies that the use of TRACE/EIT triple
filters for observation of a warm coronal loop may not help in determining
whether the cross-field isothermal assumption is satisfied or not.

analysed high-resolution spectra of 18 sample stars for the presence of
absorption lines of Tc and Li. The abundance of the latter was determined by
comparing the observed spectra to hydrostatic MARCS model spectra. Bolometric
magnitudes were established from near-IR photometry and pulsation periods. We
reclassify the star V441 Cyg as Tc-rich, and the unusual Mira star R Hya, as
well as W Eri, as Tc-poor. The abundance of Li, or an upper limit to it, was
determined for all of the sample stars. In all stars with Tc we also detected
Li. Most of them have a Li content slightly below the solar photospheric value,
except for V441 Cyg, which has ~1000 times the solar abundance. We also found
that, similar to Tc, a lower luminosity limit seems to exist for the presence
of Li. We conclude that the higher Li abundance found in the cooler and higher
luminosity objects could stem from a Li production mechanism operating on the
AGB. The stellar mass might have a crucial influence on this (extra-mixing)
production mechanism. It was speculated that the declining pulsation period of
R Hya is caused by a recent thermal pulse (TP). While not detecting Tc does not
rule out a TP, it indicates that the TPs are not strong enough to drive
dredge-up in R Hya. V441 Cyg, on the other hand, could either be a low-mass,
intrinsic S-star that produced its large amount of Li by extra-mixing
processes, or an intermediate-mass star (M>=M_sun) undergoing Li production due
to hot bottom burning.

as a functional of conformational probability densities in CG and AA models and
further expanded by ensemble averages of a set of sufficient and independent

independent basis functions from sufficiently preselected interesting physical
quantities of the system. Two variational methods are developed to optimize

polydomain states and those cross-linked directly in the low symmetry
polydomain state. For example, elastomers cross-linked in the isotropic state
then cooled to a nematic polydomain will, in the ideal limit, be perfectly
soft, and with the introduction of non-ideality, will deform at very low stress
until they are macroscopically aligned. The director patterns observed in them
will be disordered, characteristic of combinations of random deformations, and
not disclination patterns. We expect these samples to exhibit elasticity
significantly softer than monodomain samples. Polydomains cross-linked in the
nematic polydomain state will be mechanically harder and contain characteristic
schlieren director patterns. The models we use for polydomain elastomers are
spatially heterogeneous, so rather than solving them exactly we elucidate this
behavior by bounding the energies using Taylor-like (compatible test strain
fields) and Sachs (constant stress) limits extended to non-linear elasticity.
Good agreement is found with experiments that reveal the supersoft response of
some polydomains. We also analyze smectic polydomain elastomers and propose
that polydomain SmC* elastomers cross-linked in the SmA monodomain state are
promising candidates for low field electrical actuation.

infinitely many subspaces in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces. This general
approach allows us to unify many results derived recently in areas such as
compressed sensing, affine rank minimisation and analog compressed sensing.
  Our main contribution is to show that a conceptually simple iterative
projection algorithms is able to recover signals from a union of subspaces
whenever the sampling operator satisfies a bi-Lipschitz embedding condition.
Importantly, this result holds for all Hilbert spaces and unions of subspaces,
as long as the sampling procedure satisfies the condition for the set of
subspaces considered. In addition to recent results for finite unions of finite
dimensional subspaces and infinite unions of subspaces in finite dimensional

would blow up at the event horizon in violation of QM. Thus the concept of an
exact BH is in contradiction of QM and quantum gravity (QG). It is also
reminded that the mass of a BH actually appears as an INTEGRATION CONSTANT of
Einstein equations. And it has been shown that the value of this integration
constant is actually zero. Thus even classically, there cannot be finite mass
BHs though zero mass BH is allowed. It has been further shown that during
continued gravitational collapse, radiation emanating from the contracting
object gets trapped within it by the runaway gravitational field. As a
consequence, the contracting body attains a quasi-static state where outward
trapped radiation pressure gets balanced by inward gravitational pull and the
ideal classical BH state is never formed in a finite proper time. In other
words, continued gravitational collapse results in an ""Eternally Collapsing
Object"" which is a ball of hot plasma and which is asymptotically approaching
the true BH state with M=0 after radiating away its entire mass energy. And if
we include QM, this contraction must halt at a radius suggested by highest QM
acceleration. In any case no EH is ever formed and in reality, there is no
quantum information paradox.

strands of the biatomic Fe chain. Since both configurations are very close in
total energy they may coexist in experiment. We have investigated collinear
ferro- and antiferromagnetic solutions as well as a collinear state with two
moments in one direction and one in the opposite direction (up-down-up-state).
For the structure with a small interchain spacing, there is a strong exchange
interaction between the strands and the ferromagnetic state is energetically
favorable. In the structure with larger spacing, the two strands are
magnetically nearly decoupled and exhibit antiferromagnetic order along the
chain. In both cases, due to hybridization with the Ir substrate the exchange
interaction along the chain axis is relatively small compared to freestanding
biatomic iron chains. The easy magnetization axis of the Fe chains also
switches with the structural configuration and is out-of-plane for the
ferromagnetic chains with small spacing and along the chain axis for the
antiferromagnetic chains with large spacing between the two strands. Calculated
scanning tunneling microscopy images and spectra suggest the possibility to
experimentally distinguish between the two structural and magnetic
configurations.

to estimate the path characteristics from the observations. In this paper we
present a queueing theoretic setting for packet-dispersion based probing.
Analogous to network tomography, we develop techniques to estimate the
parameters of the arrival process to the individual links from the samples of
the output separations, i.e., from the end-to-end measurements. The links are
modeled as independent discrete time queues with i.i.d. arrivals. We first
obtain an algorithm to obtain the (joint) distribution of the separation
between the probes at the destination(s) for a given distribution of the
spacing at the input. The parameter estimates of the arrival process are
obtained as the minimizer of a cost function between the empirical and
calculated distributions. We also carry out extensive simulations and numerical
experiments to study the performance of the estimation algorithm under the
fairly `harsh' conditions of non stationarity of the arrival process. We find
that the estimations work fairly well for two queues in series and for

trajectories of biopolymers from arbitrary regions of the folding landscape. We
illustrate the complexity of the folding kinetics and generic aspects of the
collapse of RNA and proteins upon force quench, using simulations of an RNA
hairpin and theory based on the de Gennes model for homopolymer collapse. The
folding time, $\tau_F$, depends asymmetrically on $\delta f_S = f_S - f_m$ and
$\delta f_Q = f_m - f_Q$ where $f_S$ ($f_Q$) is the stretch (quench) force, and
$f_m$ is the transition mid-force of the RNA hairpin. In accord with
experiments, the relaxation kinetics of the molecular extension, $R(t)$, occurs
in three stages: a rapid initial decrease in the extension is followed by a
plateau, and finally an abrupt reduction in $R(t)$ that occurs as the native
state is approached.
  The duration of the plateau increases as $\lambda =\tau_Q/\tau_F$ decreases
(where $\tau_Q$ is the time in which the force is reduced from $f_S$ to $f_Q$).
Variations in the mechanisms of force quench relaxation as $\lambda$ is altered
are reflected in the experimentally measurable time-dependent entropy, which is
computed directly from the folding trajectories. An analytical solution of the
de Gennes model under tension reproduces the multistage stage kinetics in
$R(t)$. The prediction that the initial stages of collapse should also be a
generic feature of polymers is validated by simulation of the kinetics of
toroid (globule) formation in semiflexible (flexible) homopolymers in poor
solvents upon quenching the force from a fully stretched state. Our findings
give a unified explanation for multiple disparate experimental observations of
protein folding.

However, Bunn & Hogg have recently pointed out that to settle properly this
problem, one has to transport parallelly the velocity four-vector of a distant
galaxy to the observer's position. Performing such a transport along the null
geodesic of photons arriving from the galaxy, they found that the cosmological
redshift is purely kinematic. Here we argue that one should rather transport
the velocity four-vector along the geodesic connecting the points of
intersection of the world-lines of the galaxy and the observer with the
hypersurface of constant cosmic time. We find that the resulting relation
between the transported velocity and the redshift of arriving photons is not
given by a relativistic Doppler formula. Instead, for small redshifts it
coincides with the well known non-relativistic decomposition of the redshift
into a Doppler (kinematic) component and a gravitational one. We perform such a
decomposition for arbitrary large redshifts and derive a formula for the
kinematic component of the cosmological redshift, valid for any FLRW cosmology.
In particular, in a universe with Omega_m = 0.24 and Omega_Lambda = 0.76, a
quasar at a redshift 6, at the time of emission of photons reaching us today
had the recession velocity v = 0.997c. This can be contrasted with v = 0.96c,
had the redshift been entirely kinematic. Thus, for recession velocities of
such high-redshift sources, the effect of deceleration of the early Universe
clearly prevails over the effect of its relatively recent acceleration. Last
but not least, we show that the so-called proper recession velocities of
galaxies, commonly used in cosmology, are in fact radial components of the
galaxies' four-velocity vectors. As such, they can indeed attain superluminal
values, but should not be regarded as real velocities.

Results: We find that rotation has a significant impact on the explosion. The
flame develops a strong anisotropy with a preferred direction towards the
stellar poles, leaving great amounts of unburnt matter along the equatorial
plane. Conclusions: The large amount of unburnt matter is contrary to observed
spectral features of SNe Ia. Thus, rapid rotation of the progenitor star and

bead packs have been simultaneously conducted to characterize the
stress-induced anisotropy under uniaxial loading. These measurements, realized
respectively with finite and incremental deformations of the granular assembly,
are analyzed within the framework of the effective medium theory based on the
Hertz-Mindlin contact theory. Our work shows that both compressional and shear
wave velocities and consequently the incremental elastic moduli agree fairly
well with the effective medium model by Johnson et al. [J. Appl. Mech. 65, 380
(1998)], but the anisotropic stress ratio resulting from finite deformation
does not at all. As indicated by numerical simulations, the discrepancy may
arise from the fact that the model doesn't properly allow the grains to relax
from the affine motion approximation. Here we find that the interaction nature
at the grain contact could also play a crucial role for the relevant prediction
by the model; indeed, such discrepancy can be significantly reduced if the
frictional resistance between grains is removed. Another main experimental
finding is the influence of the inherent anisotropy of granular packs, realized
by different protocols of the sample preparation. Our results reveal that
compressional waves are more sensitive to the stress-induced anisotropy,

becomes tachyonic at sufficiently low temperature and baryon density. We
establish the existence of a critical density above which the scalar mode stays
in the stable regime for all temperatures. In the vector sector we study the
crossover from the hydrodynamic to the quasiparticle regime and find that it
moves to shorter wavelengths for lower temperatures. At zero baryon density the
quasinormal modes move toward distinct discrete attractor frequencies that
depend on the momentum as we increase the temperature. At finite baryon
density, however, the trajectories show a turning behavior such that for low
temperature the quasinormal mode spectrum approaches the spectrum of the
supersymmetric zero temperature normal modes. We interpret this as resolution
of the singular quasinormal mode spectrum that appears at the limiting D7 brane
embedding at vanishing baryon density.

super-Chandrasekhar-mass explosions of rapidly rotating white dwarfs (WDs). In
a preceding paper, we showed that the deflagration scenario applied to rapidly
rotating WDs generates explosions that cannot explain the majority of SNe Ia.
Aims: Rotation of the progenitor star allows super-Chandrasekhar-mass WDs to
form that have a shallower density stratification. We use simple estimates of
the production of intermediate and iron group elements in pure detonations of
rapidly rotating WDs to assess their viability in explaining rare SNe Ia.
Methods: We numerically construct WDs in hydrostatic equilibrium that rotate
according to a variety of rotation laws. The explosion products are estimated
by considering the density stratification and by evaluating the result of
hydrodynamics simulations. Results: We show that a significant amount of
intermediate mass elements is produced for theoretically motivated rotation
laws, even for prompt detonations of WDs. Conclusions: Rapidly rotating WDs
that detonate may provide an explanation of rare superluminous SNe Ia in terms
of both burning species and explosion kinematics.

investigating the well established 35 day modulation in Her X-1 in two
different ways: 1) following the turn-ons, thought to be due to the precession
of the accretion disk, and 2) following the re-appearance of the shape of the
pulse profiles, which we assume to be due to precession of the NS. The turn-on
evolution and the evolution of the phase-zero values of the precessing NS (as
determined from the pulse profiles) track each other very closely. Since the
turn-on evolution is strongly correlated with the pulse period evolution, this
means that there is also a strong correlation between the spin and the
precession of the NS. There is a very strong physical coupling between the NS
and the accretion disk, we suggest through physical feedback in the binary
system. The apparent long-term stability of the 35 d clock may be due to the
interior of the NS, the coupling of which to the observable surface effects is
of general importance for the physics of super-dense, highly magnetized
material.

massless scalar field confined in a sphere in three spatial dimensions, with
the Dirichlet boundary condition. When one tabulates all of the reported values
of the Casimir energies for two closed geometries, cubical and spherical, in
different space-time dimensions and with different boundary conditions, one
observes a complicated pattern of signs. This pattern shows that the Casimir
energy depends crucially on the details of the geometry, the number of the
spatial dimensions, and the boundary conditions. The dependence of the
\emph{sign} of the Casimir energy on the details of the geometry, for a fixed
spatial dimensions and boundary conditions has been a surprise to us and this
is our main motivation for doing the calculations presented in this paper.
Moreover, all of the calculations for spherical geometries include the use of
numerical methods combined with intricate analytic continuations to handle many
different sorts of divergences which naturally appear in this category of
problems. The presence of divergences is always a source of concern about the
accuracy of the numerical results. Our approach also includes numerical
methods, and is based on Boyer's method for calculating the electromagnetic
Casimir energy in a perfectly conducting sphere. This method, however, requires
the least amount of analytic continuations. The value that we obtain confirms
the previously established result.

pseudo-chain, which have more than one spin at some site (block). We show how
to estimate a number of all spins in the system and the intra-block coupling

in such blocks, which may disturb the state transfer. Importantly, one uses
only at-ends data and needs to be able to put the system to either the

this relationship to the two edges of each energy band, the modified Levinson
theorem for quasi-periodic potentials is derived. These two theorems differ
from the usual ones for isolated potentials in non-relativistic and
