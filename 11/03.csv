amplitudes at strong coupling to include external massive quark states. Our
quarks are actually the N=2 hypermultiplets which arise when D7-brane probes
are included in the AdS_5 x S^5 geometry. We work in the quenched
approximation, treating the N=2 matter multiplets as external sources coupled
to the N=4 SYM fields. We first derive appropriate massive-particle boundary
conditions for the string scattering worldsheets. We then find an exact
worldsheet which corresponds to the scattering of two massive quarks and two
massless gluons and extract from this the associated scattering amplitude. We
also find the worldsheet and amplitude for the scattering of four massive
quarks. Our worldsheet solutions reduce to the four massless gluon solution of
Alday and Maldacena in the limit of zero quark mass. The amplitudes we compute
can also be interpreted in terms of 2-2 scattering involving gluons and massive
W-bosons.

the local type with parameters f_NL and g_NL. We show that the distribution of
dark-matter halos is naturally described by a multivariate bias scheme where
the halo overdensity depends not only on the underlying matter density
fluctuation delta, but also on the Gaussian part of the primordial
gravitational potential phi. This corresponds to a non-local bias scheme in
terms of delta only. We derive the coefficients of the bias expansion as a
function of the halo mass by applying the peak-background split to common
parametrizations for the halo mass function in the non-Gaussian scenario. We
then compute the halo power spectrum and halo-matter cross spectrum in the
framework of Eulerian perturbation theory up to third order. Comparing our
results against N-body simulations, we find that our model accurately describes
the numerical data for wavenumbers k < 0.1-0.3 h/Mpc depending on redshift and
halo mass. In our multivariate approach, perturbations in the halo counts trace
phi on large scales and this explains why the halo and matter power spectra
show different asymptotic trends for k -> 0. This strongly scale-dependent bias
originates from terms at leading order in our expansion. This is different from
what happens using the standard univariate local bias where the scale-dependent
terms come from badly behaved higher-order corrections. On the other hand, our
biasing scheme reduces to the usual local bias on smaller scales where |phi| is
typically much smaller than the density perturbations. We finally discuss the
halo bispectrum in the context of multivariate biasing and show that, due to
its strong scale and shape dependence, it is a powerful tool for the detection
of primordial non-Gaussianity from future galaxy surveys.

Model of the Electroweak interactions is an effective low-energy theory, with a
more fundamental theory that is expected to emerge at an energy scale of the
order of the TeV. One possibility is that the more fundamental theory be
strongly interacting and the Higgs sector be given by the low-energy dynamics
of the underlying theory. We review recent works aimed to determining
observable quantities by numerical simulations of strongly interacting theories
proposed in the literature for explaining the Electroweak symmetry breaking
mechanism. These investigations are based on Monte Carlo simulations of the

Walking Technicolour scenario, a SU(2) gauge theory with two flavours of
fermions in the adjoint representation. The emerging picture is that this
theory has an infrared fixed point that dominates the large distance physics.
We shall discuss the first numerical determinations of quantities of
phenomenological interest for this theory and analyse future directions of
quantitative studies of strongly interacting beyond the Standard Model theories

from General Relativity for a concordance LCDM cosmology, including the full

we measure sigma_8(Omega_m/0.3)^0.51=0.75+-0.08 from lensing, in perfect

this framework, solution to the little hierarchy problem motivates extending
the SM electroweak (EW) 5D gauge symmetry in such a way that its breakdown to
the SM delivers the SM Higgs boson. We study signals at the large hadron

gauge quantum numbers [doublets of SU(2)_L], do not couple at leading order to
two SM particles. We find that, using the associated production of the charged
coset gauge bosons via their coupling to SM bottom quark and a (light) KK top
quark, the LHC can have a 3\sigma reach of \sim 2 (2.6) TeV for the coset gauge
boson masses with \sim 100 (1000) fb^{-1} luminosity. Since current theoretical

principle yield pattern speed values that are systematically too high for
regions inside corotation, with the difference between the real and the
measured pattern speeds increasing with decreasing radius. On the other hand,
image processing and pixel averaging result in systematically lower measured
spiral pattern speed values, regardless of the kinematics of stellar orbits.
The net effect is that roughly the correct pattern speeds are recovered,
although the trend of higher measured $\Omega_p$ at lower radii (as expected
when non-circular motions exist but are neglected) should still be observed. We
examine the Martinez-Garcia et al. (2009) photometric data and confirm that
this is indeed the case. The comparison of the size of the systematic pattern

affirms that given a collection of samples with enough information in it such
that it can be classified into classes and subclasses then (i) There exists a
mapping which classifies and subclassifies these samples (ii) There exists a
hierarchical classifier which can be constructed by using Mirroring Neural
Networks (MNNs) in combination with a clustering algorithm that can approximate
this mapping. Thus, the proof of the Mirroring theorem provides a theoretical
basis for the existence and a practical feasibility of constructing
hierarchical classifiers, given the maps. Our proposed Mirroring Theorem can
also be considered as an extension to Kolmogrovs theorem in providing a
realistic solution for unsupervised classification. The techniques we develop,
are general in nature and have led to the construction of learning machines
which are (i) tree like in structure, (ii) modular (iii) with each module
running on a common algorithm (tandem algorithm) and (iv) selfsupervised. We
have actually built the architecture, developed the tandem algorithm of such a
hierarchical classifier and demonstrated it on an example problem.

strain on the review process. The number of submissions is actually higher, as
each manuscript is often reviewed several times before publication. To face the
deluge of submissions, top journals reject a considerable fraction of
manuscripts without review, potentially declining manuscripts with merit. The
situation is frustrating for authors, reviewers and editors alike. Recently,
several editors wrote about the ``tragedy of the reviewer commons', advocating
for urgent corrections to the system. Almost every scientist has ideas on how
to improve the system, but it is very difficult, if not impossible, to perform
experiments to test which measures would be most effective. Surprisingly,
relatively few attempts have been made to model peer review. Here I implement a
simulation framework in which ideas on peer review can be quantitatively
tested. I incorporate authors, reviewers, manuscripts and journals into an
agent-based model and a peer review system emerges from their interactions. As
a proof-of-concept, I contrast an implementation of the current system, in
which authors decide the journal for their submissions, with a system in which
journals bid on manuscripts for publication. I show that, all other things
being equal, this latter system solves most of the problems currently
associated with the peer review process. Manuscripts' evaluation is faster,
authors publish more and in better journals, and reviewers' effort is optimally
utilized. However, more work is required from editors. This modeling framework
can be used to test other solutions for peer review, leading the way for an
improvement of how science is disseminated.

e/4 excitations may obey exotic non-Abelian statistics. In edge state
interference these purported non-Abelian quasiparticles should display period
e/4 Aharonov-Bohm oscillations if the interfering quasiparticle encircles an
even number of localized e/4 charges, but suppression of oscillations if an odd
number is encircled. To test this hypothesis, here we perform swept area
interference measurements at 5/2. We observe an alternating pattern of e/4 and
e/2 period oscillations in resistance. This aperiodic alternation is consistent
with proposed non-Abelian properties: the e/4 oscillations occur for encircling
an even number of localized quasiparticles, e/2 oscillations are expressed when
encircling an odd number. Aperiodic alternation corresponds to the expected
area sweep sampling the localized quasiparticles. Importantly, adding localized
quasiparticles to the encircled area by changing magnetic field induces
interchange of the e/4 and e/2 oscillation periods, specifically consistent
with non-Abelian e/4 quasiparticles.

binary system. Thermal Comptonisation by a hot electron cloud is a widely
accepted mechanism accounting for its high energy emission, while the nature of
most of its soft X-ray output is not completely understood. A further low
energy component is typically needed to model the observed spectra: pure
blackbody and Comptonisation-modified blackbody radiation by a lower
temperature (a few keV) electron plasma were suggested to explain the low
energy data. We studied the steady emission of GS 1826-238 by means of broad
band (X to soft Gamma-rays) measurements obtained by the INTEGRAL observatory
in 2003 and 2006. The newly developed, up-to-date Comptonisation model CompTB
is applied for the first time to study effectively the low-hard state
variability of a low-luminosity neutron star in a low-mass X-ray binary system.
We confirm that the 3-200 keV emission of \GS is characterised by
Comptonisation of soft seed photons by a hot electron plasma. A single spectral
component is sufficient to model the observed spectra. At lower energies, no
direct blackbody emission is observed and there is no need to postulate a low
temperature Compton region. Compared to the 2003 measurements, the plasma
temperature decreased from 20 to 14 keV in 2006, together with the seed photons
temperature. The source intensity was also found to be 30% lower in 2006,
whilst the average recurrence frequency of the X-ray bursts significantly
increased. Possible explanations for this apparent deviation from the typical
limit-cycle behaviour of this burster are discussed.

mutual information (EMI) of bi-correlated flat fading MIMO systems equiped with

of the channel are assumed available at the receiver side and at the
transmitter side respectively. As the direct maximization of the EMI needs the
use of non attractive algorithms, it is proposed to optimize an approximation
of the EMI, introduced recently, obtained when the number of transmit and
receive antennas $t$ and $r$ converge to $\infty$ at the same rate. It is
established that the relative error between the actual EMI and its
approximation is a $O(\frac{1}{t^{2}})$ term. It is shown that the left
singular eigenvectors of the optimum precoder coincide with the eigenvectors of
the transmit covariance matrix, and its singular values are solution of a
certain maximization problem. Numerical experiments show that the mutual
information provided by this precoder is close from what is obtained by
maximizing the true EMI, but that the algorithm maximizing the approximation is
much less computationally intensive.

of the quark mass m and set the lattice spacings in the compact and non-compact
directions to be a_t and a_s respectively. Extending the results of JHEP
0906:091,2009, we prove that if the ratio xi = a_s/a_t obeys 0<xi<2, then the
minimum of the one-loop lattice potential for one or more Dirac flavors is Z_N
symmetric at the chiral point. For xi=0 our formulas reduce to those obtained
in a continuum regularization of the R^3, and our proof holds in that case as
well. As we increase m from zero, we find a cascade of transitions where Z_N
breaks to Z_K. For very small masses, K ~ 1/(a_t m) >> 1, while for large
masses K ~ O(1). Despite certain UV sensitivities of the lattice one-loop
potential, this phase structure is similar to the one obtained in the continuum
works of Kovtun-Unsal-Yaffe, Myers-Ogilvie, and Hollowood-Myers. We explain the

short-period variables to be detected. A population of RR Lyrae stars
determined to belong to M32 would prove the existence of an ancient population
in that galaxy, a subject of some debate. We detected 17 RR Lyrae variables in
F1 and 14 in F2. A 1-sigma upper limit of 6 RR Lyrae variables belonging to M32
is inferred from these two fields alone. Use of our two ACS/WFC parallel fields
provides better constraints on the M31 background, however, and implies that
$7_{-3}^{+4}$ (68 % confidence interval) RR Lyrae variables in F1 belong to
M32. We have therefore found evidence for an ancient population in M32. It
seems to be nearly indistinguishable from the ancient population of M31. The RR
Lyrae stars in the F1 and F2 fields have indistinguishable mean V-band
magnitudes, mean periods, distributions in the Bailey diagram and ratios of RRc
to RR(tot) types. However, the color distributions in the two fields are
different, with a population of red RRab variables in F1 not seen in F2. We
suggest that these might be identified with the detected M32 RR Lyrae
population, but the small number of stars rules out a definitive claim.

view of its nucleus and circumnuclear NLR. We perform the first spatially
resolved high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of the `ionization cone' in any
AGN, and use the sensitive line diagnostics offered by the HETG to measure the
ionization state, density, and temperature at discrete points along the ionized
NLR. We argue that the NLR takes the form of outflowing photoionized gas,
rather than gas that has been collisionally ionized by the small-scale radio
jet in NGC 1068. We investigate evidence for any velocity gradients in the
outflow, and describe our next steps in modeling the spatially resolved spectra
as a function of distance from the nucleus.

into that of a single particle, due to the non-trivial coupling between the
center-of-mass and the relative coordinates, even in the presence of central
potentials. We focus on the case of zero total momentum, which is equivalent to
that of a single particle in a Sutherland lattice. We show that zero-energy
states induce striking new features such as discontinuities in the relative
wave function, for particles interacting through a step potential, and a
concentration of relative density near the classical turning point, if
particles interact via a Coulomb potential. In the latter case we also find
that the two-body system becomes unstable above a critical coupling. These
phenomena may have bearing on the nature of strong coupling phases in graphene.

Tam \cite{ShiTam02}: Let $(\Omega, g)$ be an $n$-dimensional ($n \geq 3$)
compact Riemannian manifold, spin when $n>7$, with non-negative scalar
curvature and mean convex boundary. If every boundary component $\Sigma_i$ has
positive scalar curvature and embeds isometrically as a mean convex star-shaped
hypersurface ${\hat \Sigma}_i \subset \R^n$, then
  \int_{\Sigma_i} H d \sigma \le \int_{{\hat \Sigma}_i} \hat{H} d {\hat \sigma}

the Euclidean mean curvature of ${\hat \Sigma}_i$ in $\R^n$, and where $d

equality in (\ref{eqn: main theorem}) holds for some boundary component
$\Sigma_i$ if, and only if, $(\Omega, g)$ is isometric to a domain in $\R^n$.

\Sigma_i$'s in $\R^n$ by the $\frac{H}{R}$-flow studied by Gerhardt

luminosities of 10^32-34 erg/s. Among these are a very absorbed likely
hyper-luminous star with X-ray/optical spectra and luminosities comparable with
those of eta Carina, a new X-ray selected WN8 Wolf-Rayet star, a new Be/X-ray

sources in active galactic nuclei (AGN) are believed to arise in highly
inclined accretion disks around central engines. These ""disk maser candidates""
are of interest primarily because angular structure and rotation curves can be
resolved with interferometers, enabling dynamical study. We identify five new
disk maser candidates in studies with the Green Bank Telescope, bringing the
total number published to 30. We discovered two (NGC1320, NGC17) in a survey of
40 inclined active galaxies (v_{sys}< 20000 kms^{-1}). The remaining three disk
maser candidates were identified in monitoring of known sources: NGC449,
NGC2979, NGC3735. We also confirm a previously marginal case in UGC4203. For
the disk maser candidates reported here, inferred rotation speeds are 130-500
kms^{-1}. Monitoring of three more rapidly rotating candidate disks (CG211,
NGC6264, VV340A) has enabled measurement of likely orbital centripetal
acceleration, and estimation of central masses (2-7x10^7 M_\odot) and mean disk
radii (0.2-0.4pc). Accelerations may ultimately permit estimation of distances
when combined with interferometer data. This is notable because the three AGN
are relatively distant (10000<v_{sys}<15000 kms^{-1}). As signposts of highly
inclined geometries at galactocentric radii of \sim0.1-1pc, disk masers also
provide robust orientation references that allow analysis of (mis)alignment
between AGN and surrounding galactic stellar disks, even without
interferometric mapping. We find no preference among published disk maser
candidates to lie in high-inclination galaxies, providing independent support
for conclusions that central engines and galactic plane orientations are not
correlated. (ABRIDGED)

motion is equally important. Due to the dynamical entanglement of atomic motion
and light, the measurement of light affects the many-body atomic state as well.
The conditional atomic dynamics can be described using the Quantum Monte Carlo
Wave Function Simulation method. In this paper, we emphasize how this usually
complicated numerical procedure can be reduced to an analytical solution after
some assumptions and approximations valid for macroscopic Bose-Einstein
condensates (BEC) with large atom numbers. The theory can be applied for
lattices with both low filling factors (e.g. one atom per lattice site in
average) and very high filling factors (e.g. a BEC in a double-well potential).
The purity of the resulting multipartite entangled atomic state is analyzed.

groups, and clusters can provide new information about how these objects are
triggered and fueled, similar to how these environments have been employed to
study galaxy evolution. We have obtained new XMM-Newton observations of seven
X-ray selected groups and poor clusters with 0.02 < z < 0.06 for comparison
with previous samples that mostly included rich clusters and optically-selected
groups. Our final sample has ten groups and six clusters in this low-redshift
range (split at a velocity dispersion of $\sigma = 500$ km/s). We find that the
X-ray selected AGN fraction increases from $f_A(L_X>10^{41}; M_R<M_R^*+1) =
0.047^{+0.023}_{-0.016}$ in clusters to $0.091^{+0.049}_{-0.034}$ for the
groups (85% significance), or a factor of two, for AGN above an 0.3-8keV X-ray
luminosity of $10^{41}$ erg/s hosted by galaxies more luminous than $M_R^*+1$.
The trend is similar, although less significant, for a lower-luminosity host
threshold of $M_R = -20$ mag. For many of the groups in the sample we have also
identified AGN via standard emission-line diagnostics and find that these AGN
are nearly disjoint from the X-ray selected AGN. Because there are substantial
differences in the morphological mix of galaxies between groups and clusters,
we have also measured the AGN fraction for early-type galaxies alone to
determine if the differences are directly due to environment, or indirectly due
to the change in the morphological mix. We find that the AGN fraction in
early-type galaxies is also lower in clusters $f_{A,n>2.5}(L_X>10^{41};
M_R<M_R^*+1) = 0.048^{+0.028}_{-0.019}$ compared to $0.119^{+0.064}_{-0.044}$

insulators causes a gradual destruction of antiferromagnetism and the emergence
of high-temperature superconductivity. Optimal superconductivity is achieved at
a doping concentration p beyond which further increases in doping cause a
weakening and eventual disappearance of superconductivity. A potential
explanation for this demise is that ferromagnetic fluctuations compete with
superconductivity in the overdoped regime. In this case a ferromagnetic phase
at very low temperatures is predicted to exist beyond the doping concentration
at which superconductivity disappears. Here we report on a direct examination
of this scenario in overdoped La2-xSrxCuO4 using the technique of muon spin
relaxation. We detect the onset of static magnetic moments of electronic origin
at low temperature in the heavily overdoped nonsuperconducting region. However,
the magnetism does not exist in a commensurate long-range ordered state.
Instead it appears as a dilute concentration of static magnetic moments. This
finding places severe restrictions on the form of ferromagnetism that may exist
in the overdoped regime. Although an extrinsic impurity cannot be absolutely
ruled out as the source of the magnetism that does occur, the results presented
here lend support to electronic band calculations that predict the occurrence
of weak localized ferromagnetism at high doping.

party hubs are local coordinators whereas date hubs are global connectors. Here
we show that the reported importance of date hubs to network connectivity can
in fact be attributed to a tiny subset of them. Crucially, these few, extremely
central, hubs do not display particularly low expression correlation,
undermining the idea of a link between this quantity and hub function. The
date/party distinction was originally motivated by an approximately bimodal
distribution of hub co-expression; we show that this feature is not always
robust to methodological changes. Additionally, topological properties of hubs
do not in general correlate with co-expression. Thus, we suggest that a
date/party dichotomy is not meaningful and it might be more useful to conceive
of roles for protein-protein interactions rather than individual proteins. We
find significant correlations between interaction centrality and the functional

Galaxy Cluster Sample) with available high-quality X-ray data from Chandra, and
apply 16 cool-core diagnostics to them, some of them new. We also correlate
optical properties of brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) with X-ray properties.
To segregate cool core and non-cool-core clusters, we find that central cooling
time, t_cool, is the best parameter for low redshift clusters with high quality
data, and that cuspiness is the best parameter for high redshift clusters. 72%
of clusters in our sample have a cool core (t_cool < 7.7 h_{71}^{-1/2} Gyr) and
44% have strong cool cores (t_cool <1.0 h_{71}^{-1/2} Gyr). For the first time
we show quantitatively that the discrepancy in classical and spectroscopic mass
deposition rates can not be explained with a recent formation of the cool
cores, demonstrating the need for a heating mechanism to explain the cooling
flow problem. [Abridged]

and molecular line luminosity, for a variety of molecular transitions, using a
sample of 34 nearby galaxies spanning a broad range of infrared luminosities
(10^{10} < L_{IR} < 10^{12.5} L_sun). We show that the power-law index of the
relation is sensitive to the critical density of the molecular gas tracer used,
and that the dominant driver in observed molecular line ratios in galaxies is
the gas density. As most nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs)
exhibit strong signatures of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in their center, we
revisit previous claims questioning the reliability of HCN as a probe of the
dense gas responsible for star formation in the presence of AGN. We find that
the enhanced HCN(1-0)/CO(1-0) luminosity ratio observed in ULIRGs can be
successfully reproduced using numerical models with fixed chemical abundances
and without AGN-induced chemistry effects. We extend this analysis to a total
of ten molecular line ratios by combining the following transitions: CO(1-0),
HCO+(1-0), HCO+(3-2), HCN(1-0), and HCN(3-2). Our results suggest that AGNs
reside in systems with higher dense gas fraction, and that chemistry or other
effects associated with their hard radiation field may not dominate (NGC 1068
is one exception). Galaxy merger could be the underlying cause of increased
dense gas fraction and the evolutionary stage of such mergers may be another
determinant of the HCN/CO luminosity ratio.

annihilation signal could be up to two orders of magnitude larger than that of
the smooth halo within the Galactic virial radius. The local boost is inversely
proportional to the smooth halo density, and thus is O(1) within the solar
radius, which could translate into interesting signatures for dark matter
direct detection experiments: The temporal correlation of dark matter detection
can change by a factor of 2 in the span of 10 years, while there will be
significant correlations in the velocity space of dark matter particles. This
can introduce O(1) uncertainty in the direction of local dark matter wind,
which was believed to be a benchmark of directional dark matter searches or the

a survey volume big enough to determine the bright end of the Halpha luminosity

on the dark matter density and isocurvature fluctuations requires non-minimal
fine-tuning of inflationary parameters or the axion misalignment angle (or
both) for Peccei-Quinn symmetry-breaking scales $f_a > 10^{12}$ GeV. To gauge
the degree of tuning in models with many axion-like fields at similar
symmetry-breaking scales and masses, as may occur in string theoretic models
that include a QCD axion, we introduce a figure of merit ${\cal F}$ that

slow roll parameter $\epsilon$ and each of the axion misalignment angles,
$\theta_0$. For a single axion, $\mathcal{F} \lesssim 10^{-11}$ is needed to
avoid conflict with observations. We show that the fine tuning of $\mathcal{F}$
becomes exponentially more extreme in the case of numerous axion-like fields.
Anthropic arguments are insufficient to explain the fine tuning because the
bulk of the anthropically allowed parameter space is observationally ruled out
by limits on the cosmic microwave background isocurvature modes. Therefore,
this tuning presents a challenge to the compatibility of string-theoretic
models with light axions and inflationary cosmology.

exclusive has been questioned more and more often; most notably, the
observations of Ly-alpha emission from ULIRGs seem to counter this view. In
this paper we seek to address the reverse question. How large a fraction of
Ly-alpha selected galaxies are ULIRGs? Using two samples of 24/25 Ly-alpha
emitting galaxies at z = 0.3/2.3, we perform this test, including results at z

systematically increases towards lower redshifts. There is a hint that this
evolution may be quite sudden and that it happens around a redshift of z ~ 2.5.
After measuring the infrared luminosities of the Ly-alpha emitters, we find
that they are in the normal to ULIRG range in the lower redshift sample, while
the higher redshift galaxies all have luminosities in the ULIRG category. The
Ly-alpha escape fractions for these infrared bright galaxies are in the range
1-100 % in the z = 0.3 galaxies, but are very low in the z = 2.3 galaxies, 0.4

far of any elliptical galaxy to revise and extend the previous investigations
of the dynamics of NGC 1399, the central dominant galaxy of the nearby Fornax
cluster of galaxies. Our sample now comprises velocities for almost 700 GCs
with projected galactocentric radii between 6 and 100 kpc. In addition, we use
velocities published by Bergond et al. (2007). We study the kinematics of the
metal-poor and metal-rich subpopulations and perform spherical Jeans modelling.
  The most important results are: The metal-rich (red) GCs resemble the stellar
field population of NGC 1399 in the region of overlap. Both subpopulations are
kinematically distinct and do not show a smooth transition. It is not possible
to find a common dark halo which reproduces simultaneously the properties of
both subpopulations. Some velocities of blue GCs are only to be explained by
orbits with very large apogalactic distances, thus indicating a contamination
with GCs which belong to the entire Fornax cluster rather than to NGC 1399.
Stripped GCs from nearby elliptical galaxies, particularly NGC 1404, may also
contaminate the metal-poor sample. We argue in favour of a scenario in which
the majority of the blue cluster population has been accreted during the
assembly of the Fornax cluster. The red cluster population shares the dynamical
history of the galaxy itself. Therefore we recommend to use a dark halo based
on the red GCs alone. The dark halo which fits best is marginally less massive
than the halo quoted by Richtler et al. (2004). The comparison with X-ray
analyses is satisfactory in the inner regions, but without showing evidence for
a transition from a galaxy to a cluster halo, as suggested by X-ray work.

AGN with unusually anemic broad emission line regions). These would constitute
the largest sample of such objects, being of similar size and complementary in

larger radio-loud BL Lac population. Serendipitous discoveries of unusual white

an upper limit of 0.2% for the range of brightness changes occurring as a

model processes on a flexible way. The intentional level of this model helps an
engineer to execute a process with a strong relationship to the situation of
the project at hand. In the literature, attempts for having a practical use of
maps are not numerous. Our aim is to enhance the guidance mechanisms of the
process execution by reusing graph algorithms. After clarifying the existing
relationship between graphs and maps, we improve the MAP model by adding
qualitative criteria. We then offer a way to express maps with graphs and
propose to use Graph theory algorithms to offer an automatic guidance of the
map. We illustrate our proposal by an example and discuss its limitations.

one of the best sources in which to study how the binary system and the neutron
star spin evolve. Furthermore, the characteristics of this new source indicate
that there might exist a population of AMXPs undergoing weak outbursts which

dark matter haloes. The method is an extension of that proposed by Tormen et
al. (2004) and Giocoli et al. (2008a), which identifies a subhalo as a group of
self-bound particles that prior to being accreted by the main progenitor of the
host halo belonged to one and the same progenitor halo (hereafter satellite).
However, this definition does not account for the fact that these satellite
haloes themselves may also have substructure, which thus gives rise to
sub-subhaloes, etc. Our new algorithm identifies substructures at all levels of
this hierarchy, and we use it to determine the mass function of all
substructure (counting sub-haloes, sub-subhaloes, etc.). On average, haloes
which formed more recently tend to have a larger mass fraction in substructure
and to be less concentrated than average haloes of the same mass. We provide
quantitative fits to these correlations. Even though our algorithm is very
different from that of Gao et al. (2004), we too find that the subhalo mass
function per unit mass at redshift z = 0 is universal. This universality
extends to any redshift only if one accounts for the fact that host haloes of a
given mass are less concentrated at higher redshifts, and concentration and
substructure abundance are anti-correlated. This universality allows a simple
parametrization of the subhalo mass function integrated over all host halo
masses, at any given time. We provide analytic fits to this function which
should be useful in halo model analyses which equate galaxies with halo
substructure when interpreting clustering in large sky surveys. Finally, we
discuss systematic differences in the subhalo mass function that arise from
different definitions of (host) halo mass.

utilizing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements over a wide

flat portions of nested Fermi surface, while the other type prefers to be
commensurate with the real space lattice but also may be driven away from this

driven away from its non-interacting value at certain doping levels, giving

for embedding the resulting masses into the generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG)

establish a precise connection among three distinct frameworks: the cosmon

continuum emission from ionized gas rivals the stellar luminosity at optical
wavelengths. In addition, we find that nebular line emission is significant in
many commonly used broad-band HST filters including the F814W I-band, the F555W
V-band and the F435W B-band. Two young massive clusters (YMCs) in NGC 4449 were
targeted for spectroscopic observations after Reines et al. (2008a) discovered
an F814W I-band excess in their photometric study of radio-detected clusters in
the galaxy. The spectra were obtained with the Dual Imaging Spectrograph on the
3.5 m APO telescope. We supplement these data with HST and SDSS photometry. By
comparing our data to the Starburst99 and GALEV models, we find that nebular
continuum emission competes with the stellar light in our observations and that
the relative contribution is largest in the U- and I-bands, where the Balmer
and Paschen jumps are located. The spectra also exhibit strong line emission
including the [SIII] 9069,9532 lines in the HST F814W I-band. We find that the
combination of nebular continuum and line emission can account for the F814W
I-band excess found by Reines et al. (2008a). In an effort to provide a
benchmark for estimating the impact of ionized gas emission on photometric
observations of YMCs, we compute the relative contributions of the stellar
continuum, nebular continuum, and emission lines to the total flux of a 3
Myr-old cluster through various HST filter/instrument combinations, including
filters in the WFC3. We urge caution when comparing observations of YMCs to
evolutionary synthesis models since nebular emission can have a large impact on
magnitudes and colors of young (< 5 Myr) clusters, significantly affecting
inferred properties such as ages, masses and extinctions. (Abridged)

occupancy of chromium and iron was found within the FeAs4/4 layer (93+/-1% Fe :
7+/-1% Cr). We suggest that the partial Cr-doping at the Fe site is the reason
for the absence of a spin-density wave anomaly and superconductivity in this

short-range spin correlations below ~100 K and long-range antiferromagnetic

magnetic space group C_Pmma' (a' = a-b, b'=a+b, c'=c), where Cr3+-ions occupy
the 4g (0, 1/4, z) Wyckoff position. The magnetic moments are aligned along the

mesons, particularly pions, from nucleon or nuclear targets. It is especially
important and theoretically interesting in itself to study $coherent$ neutrino
production of pions, i.e. wherein the target does not break up. Preserving the
target requires that the meson produced in the reaction will be charged for
Charged Current (CC) interactions or neutral for Neutral Current (NC)

electroproduction for which considerable progress has been made in
understanding the intermediate energy, small momentum transfer region by
applying the Generalized Parton Distribution (GPD) phenomenology. The GPD

snapshot of the AS graph is thus important. However, the first step towards
this direction is to obtain the ability to faithfully reproduce the full AS

accurately emulate and reproduce the distinctive properties of the Internet
graph. Our approach is based on (a) the identification of the jellyfish-like
structure [1] of the Internet and (b) the consideration of the peer-to-peer and
customer-provider relations between ASs. We are the first to exploit the
distinctive structure of the Internet graph together with utilizing the
information provided by the AS relationships in order to create a tool with the
aforementioned capabilities. Comparing our generator with the existing ones in
the literature, the main difference is found on the fact that our tool does not
try to satisfy specific metrics, but tries to remain faithful to the conceptual
model of the Internet structure. In addition, our approach can lead to (i) the
identification of important attributes and patterns in the Internet AS
topology, as well as, (ii) the extraction of valuable information on the
various relationships between ASs and their effect on the formulation of the
Internet structure. We implement our graph generator and we evaluate it using
the largest and most recent available dataset for the AS topology. Our

paper considers secure network coding with nonuniform or restricted wiretap
sets, for example, networks with unequal link capacities where a wiretapper can
wiretap any subset of $k$ links, or networks where only a subset of links can
be wiretapped. Existing results show that for the case of uniform wiretap sets
(networks with equal capacity links/packets where any $k$ can be wiretapped),
the secrecy capacity is given by the cut-set bound, and can be achieved by
injecting $k$ random keys at the source which are decoded at the sink along
with the message. This is the case whether or not the communicating users have
information about the choice of wiretap set. In contrast, we show that for the
nonuniform case, the cut-set bound is not achievable in general when the
wiretap set is unknown, whereas it is achievable when the wiretap set is made
known. We give achievable strategies where random keys are canceled at
intermediate non-sink nodes, or injected at intermediate non-source nodes.

both optical and X-ray spectra are available. This allows alpha_ox to be
defined at arbitrary frequencies, rather than the standard 2500 Angstroms and 2

influence the alpha_ox-l_opt relation, the slope of the relation does depend on
the choice of X-ray energy. The slope of the relation becomes steeper when
alpha_ox is defined at low (~ 1 keV) X-ray energies. This change is significant
when compared to the slope predicted by a decrease in the baseline over which
alpha_ox is defined. The slopes are also marginally flatter than predicted at
high (~ 10 keV) X-ray energies. Partial correlation tests show that while the
primary driver of alpha_ox is l_opt, the Eddington ratio correlates strongly
with alpha_ox when l_opt is taken into account, so accretion rate may help
explain these results. We combine the alpha_ox-l_opt and Gamma -L_bol/L_Edd
relations to naturally explain two results: 1) the existence of the Gamma-l_x
relation as reported in Young et al. (2009) and 2) the lack of a Gamma-l_opt
relation. The consistency of the optical/X-ray correlations establishes a more
complete framework for understanding the relation between quasar emission
mechanisms. We also discuss two correlations with the hard X-ray bolometric
correction, which we show correlates with both alpha_ox and Eddington ratio.
This confirms that an increase in accretion rate correlates with a decrease in
the fraction of up-scattered disk photons.

argument mappings, of certain quite particular plane algebraic curves. These
curves are the zero sets of reduced A-discriminants of two variables. We
consider the coamoeba primarily as a subset of the torus T^2=(R/2\pi Z)^2, but
also as a subset of its covering space R^2, in which case the coamoeba consists
of an infinite, doubly periodic image. In fact, it turns out to be natural to
take multiplicities into account, and thus to treat the coamoeba as a chain in
the sense of algebraic topology.
  We give a very explicit description of the coamoeba as the union of two
mirror images of a (generally non-convex) polygon, which is easily constructed
from a matrix B that represents the Gale transform of the original collection
A. We also give an area formula for the coamoeba, and we show that the coamoeba
is intimately related to a certain zonotope. In fact, on the torus T^2 the
coamoeba and the zonotope together form a cycle, and hence precisely cover the
entire torus an integer number of times. This integer is proved to be equal to
the (normalized) volume of the convex hull of A.

The most widely used communication protocol in the web services model, SOAP, is
a simple protocol for the exchange of messages. The serialization of large SOAP
responses is a major performance bottleneck in a SOAP message exchange.
Clearly, some web servers can expect to receive many similar messages for a
particular web service as they share the same signature. The idea behind this
paper is to avoid the redundant serialization stage of SOAP responses for
request which have the same call parameters. The technique exploits the
similarities between call parameters to improve web service Response Time by
avoiding redundant serialization of the same response with the help of a
middleware running on top of web server. The middleware will maintain a trie of
incoming parameters for every set of current requests. This way request
processing and serialization of the response of same requests will be done only
once. In a nutshell, to serialize only the different responses is the simplest
way to avoid extra work done by a serializer. It might worth noting that
although our approach is to utilize the exact repeating portion parameters, the
middleware can be configured to apply changes made to the result set of
response to the serialized response being maintained in a trie to generate
valid results.

important issue in the design of such systems. Hence this paper proposes an
energy efficient security protocol for WBSN where security is provided to the
physiological data, which is being transmitted from the sensor node to the sink
device. This is achieved by authenticating the data using patients biometric,
encrypting the data using Quasi Group cryptography after compressing the image
data using an energy efficient number theory based technique.

People use software bearing in mind that it is reliable and can be trust upon

exploitable security hole then how can they be safe for use. Security brings
value to software in terms of peoples trust. The value provided by secure
software is of vital importance because many critical functions are entirely
dependent on the software. That is why security is a serious topic which should
be given proper attention during the entire SDLC, right from the beginning. For
the proper implementation of security in the software, twenty one security
rules are proposed in this paper along with validation results. It is found
that by applying these rules as per given implementation mechanism, most of the
vulnerabilities are eliminated in the software and a more secure software can

recognition has been recognized as one of the most mature and established

recognition receiving increasingly more attention the amount of fingerprints
collected has been constantly creating enormous problems in storage and

indispensable step in automated fingerprint recognition systems. Several
researchers have presented approaches for fingerprint image compression. In
this paper, we propose a novel and efficient scheme for fingerprint image
compression. The presented scheme utilizes the Bezier curve representations for
effective compression of fingerprint images. Initially, the ridges present in
the fingerprint image are extracted along with their coordinate values using
the approach presented. Subsequently, the control points are determined for all
the ridges by visualizing each ridge as a Bezier curve. The control points of
all the ridges determined are stored and are used to represent the fingerprint
image. When needed, the fingerprint image is reconstructed from the stored
control points using Bezier curves. The quality of the reconstructed
fingerprint is determined by a formal evaluation. The proposed scheme achieves
considerable memory reduction in storing the fingerprint.

over Internet and local area network become responsible for the distribution of
different threats and vulnerabilities in the computing systems. The current
signature detection approach used by IDS, detects unclear actions based on

that pulsars evolve through a progressive narrowing of the emission cone
combined with progressive alignment of the spin and magnetic axes. The new data
provide strong evidence for the alignment over a time-scale of about 1 Myr with
a log standard deviation of around 0.8 across the observed population. This
time-scale is shorter than the time-scale of about 10 Myr found by previous
authors, but the log standard deviation is larger. The results are inconsistent
with models based on magnetic field decay alone or monotonic counter-alignment
to orthogonal rotation. The best fits are obtained for a braking index
parameter n_gamma approximately equal to 2.3, consistent the mean of the six
measured values, but based on a much larger sample of young pulsars. The
least-squares fitted models are used to predict the mean inclination angle
between the spin and magnetic axes as a function of log characteristic age.
Comparing these predictions to existing estimates it is found that the model in
which pulsars are born with a random angle of inclination gives the best fit to
the data. Plots of the mean beaming fraction as a function of characteristic
age are presented using the best-fitting model parameters.

Nested queries, and queries that invoke user-defined functions, which are
written using a mix of procedural and SQL constructs, are often used in such
applications. A straight-forward evaluation of such queries involves repeated
execution of parameterized sub-queries or blocks containing queries and
procedural code.
  An important problem that arises while optimizing nested queries as well as
queries with joins, aggregates and set operations is the problem of finding an
optimal sort order from a factorial number of possible sort orders. We show
that even a special case of this problem is NP-Hard, and present practical
heuristics that are effective and easy to incorporate in existing query
optimizers.
  We also consider iterative execution of queries and updates inside complex
procedural blocks such as user-defined functions and stored procedures.
Parameter batching is an important means of improving performance as it enables
set-orientated processing. The key challenge to parameter batching lies in
rewriting a given procedure/function to process a batch of parameter values. We
propose a solution, based on program analysis and rewrite rules, to automate
the generation of batched forms of procedures and replace iterative database
calls within imperative loops with a single call to the batched form.

processing of signals in a union of subspaces. The main functions of this
framework are two. Analog compression that narrows down the input bandwidth
prior to sampling with commercial devices. A nonlinear algorithm then detects
the input subspace prior to conventional signal processing. A representative
union model of spectrally-sparse signals serves as a test-case to study these
Xampling functions. We adopt three metrics for the choice of analog
compression: robustness to model mismatch, required hardware accuracy and
software complexities. We conduct a comprehensive comparison between two
sub-Nyquist acquisition strategies for spectrally-sparse signals, the random
demodulator and the modulated wideband converter (MWC), in terms of these
metrics and draw operative conclusions regarding the choice of analog
compression. We then address lowrate signal processing and develop an algorithm
for that purpose that enables convenient signal processing at sub-Nyquist rates
from samples obtained by the MWC. We conclude by showing that a variety of
other sampling approaches for different union classes fit nicely into our
framework.

To reconstruct the image of an object from its hologram, obtained under
illumination by monochromatic scalar waves, numerical calculations of Fresnel
integrals are required. To improve spatial resolution in the resulting
reconstruction, we re-sample the holographic data before application of the
reconstruction algorithm. This procedure amounts to inverting an interpolated
Fresnel diffraction image to recover the object. The advantage of this method
is demonstrated on experimental data, for the case of visible-light Gabor
holography of a resolution grid and a gnat wing.

optical counterpart from the combined VLA-COSMOS and zCOSMOS samples. The
advantage of this sample is the availability of optical spectroscopic
information, high quality redshifts, and accurate density determination.
  By comparing the star formation rates estimated from the optical spectral
energy distribution with those based on the radio luminosity, we divide the
radio sources in three families, passive AGN, non-passive AGN and star forming
galaxies. These families occupy specific regions of the 8.0-4.5 $\mu$m infrared
color--specific star formation plane, from which we extract the corresponding
control samples.
  Only the passive AGN have a significantly different environment distribution
from their control sample. The fraction of radio-loud passive AGN increases
from ~2% in underdense regions to ~15% for overdensities (1+delta) greater than
10. This trend is also present as a function of richness of the groups hosting
the radio sources. Passive AGN in overdensities tend to have higher radio
luminosities than those in lower density environments. Since the black hole
mass distribution is similar in both environments, we speculate that, for low
radio luminosities, the radio emission is controlled (through fuel
disponibility or confinement of radio jet by local gas pressure) by the
interstellar medium of the host galaxy, while in other cases it is determined
by the structure (group or cluster) in which the galaxy resides.

discussed in the framework of the Statistical Model. In this model a rapid

is well reproduced by the Statistical Model, but the change in the K+/pi+ ratio
is somewhat less pronounced than the one observed by the NA49 collaboration.
The calculated smooth increase of the K-/pi ratio and the shape of the Xi-/pi+
and Omega-/pi+ ratios exhibiting maxima at different incident energies is
consistent with the presently available experimental data. We conclude that the
measured particle ratios with $20-30%$ deviations agree with a hadronic
freeze-out scenario. These deviations seem to occur just in the transition from
baryon-dominated to meson-dominated freeze-out.

oscillations of the nuclear concentration with a time period of around 1-2
hours. The NF-kB network contains several feedback loops modulating the overall
response of NF-kB activity. While IkBa is known to drive and IkBe is known to
dampen the oscillations, the precise role of A20 negative feedback remains to
be elucidated. Here we propose a model of the NF-kB system focusing on three
negative feedback loops (IkBa, IkBe and A20) which capture the experimentally
observed responses in wild-type and knockout cells. We find that A20, like
IkBe, efficiently dampens the oscillations albeit through a distinct mechanism.
In addition, however, we have discovered a new functional role of A20 by which
it controls the oscillation period of nuclear NF-kB. The design based on three
nested feedback loops allows independent control of period and amplitude decay
in the oscillatory response. Based on these results we predict that adjusting
the expression level of A20, e.g. by siRNA, the period can be changed by up to
a factor 2.

experiences an increased accretion rate, and the system's luminosity increases
accordingly. The archetype is the FU Orionis (FU Ori) outburst, where the
accretion rate can increase by three orders of magnitude (and the brightness of
the system by five magnitudes). The cause appears to be instability in the
circumstellar disc, but there is currently some debate as to the nature of this
instability (e.g. thermal, gravitational, magneto-rotational). This paper
details high resolution Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations that
were carried out to investigate the influence of stellar encounters on disc
dynamics. Star-star encounters (where the primary has a self-gravitating,
marginally stable protostellar disc) were simulated with various orbital
parameters to investigate the resulting disc structure and dynamics. Crucially,
the simulations include the effects of radiative transfer to realistically
model the resulting thermodynamics. Our results show that the accretion history
and luminosity of the system during the encounter displays many of the features
of outburst phenomena. In particular, the magnitudes and decay times seen are
comparable to those of FU Ori. There are two caveats to this assertion: the
first is that these events are not expected to occur frequently enough to
explain all FU Ori or EX Lupi; the second is that the inner discs of these
simulations are subject to numerical viscosity, which will act to reduce the
accretion rate (although it has less of an effect on the total mass accreted).
In short, these results cannot rule out binary interactions as a potential
source of some FU Ori-esque outbursts.

spectral range: the bending mode of CO_2 ice at 15.2 micron and the ice band
between 5 and 7 micron that includes contributions from the bending mode of
water ice at 6 micron amongst other ice species. The 5-7 micron band is
difficult to identify in our LMC sample due to the conspicuous presence of PAH
emission superimposed onto the ice spectra. We identify water ice in the
spectra of two sources; the spectrum of one of those sources also exhibits the
6.8 micron ice feature attributed to ammonium and methanol. We model the CO_2
band in detail, using the combination of laboratory ice profiles available in
the literature. We find that a significant fraction (> 50%) of CO_2 ice is
locked in a water-rich component, consistent with what is observed for Galactic
sources. The majority of the sources in the LMC also require a pure-CO_2
contribution to the ice profile, evidence of thermal processing. There is a
suggestion that CO_2 production might be enhanced in the LMC, but the size of
the available sample precludes firmer conclusions. We place our results in the
context of the star formation environment in the LMC.

Galaxies (HEG and LEG, respectively). All broad-line objects are HEG from the
point of view of their narrow emission line ratios and all HEG are FRII
radio-galaxies with log L(178) [erg/s] > 32.8. Conversely LEG cover the whole
range of radio power encompassed by this 3CR subsample (30.7 < log L(178) <
35.4) and they are of both FRI and FRII type. The brightest LEG are all FRII.
HEG and LEG obey to two (quasi) linear correlations between the optical line
and extended radio luminosities, with HEG being brighter than LEG in the [OIII]
line by a factor of ~10. HEG and LEG are offset also in a plane that compares
the black hole mass and the ionizing nuclear luminosity. However, although HEG
are associated with higher nuclear luminosities, we find LEG among the
brightest radio sources of the sample and with a clear FRII morphology,
indistinguishable from those seen in HEG. This suggests that LEG are not simply
objects with a lower level of accretion. We speculate that the differences
between LEG and HEG are related to a different mode of accretion: LEG are
powered by hot gas, while HEG require the presence of cold accreting material.
The high temperature of the accreting gas in LEG accounts for the lack of
""cold"" structures (i.e. molecular torus and Broad Line Region), for the reduced
radiative output of the accretion disk, and for the lower gas excitation.

neutrinos from dark matter annihilation in the Earth, the Sun and at the
Galactic centre is presented. The model contains an extra Higgs doublet, a
neutral component of which is chosen as dark matter candidate. There are three
distinct mass ranges for which consistency both with WMAP abundance and direct
searches can be obtained: a low (4 - 8 GeV), a middle (60 - 70 GeV) and a high
(500 - 1500 GeV) WIMP mass range. The first case is of interest as we showed
that the model can at the same time give the correct WMAP abundance and account
for the positive DAMA results without contradicting other direct searches. We
present how capture in the Sun can further constrain this scenario using
Super-Kamiokande data. Indirect detection through neutrinos is challenging for
the middle and high mass ranges. For the former, the presence of the so-called
'iron resonance' gives rise to larger neutrino fluxes for WIMP masses around 60
- 70 GeV since capture by the Earth is enhanced. The addition of light
right-handed Majorana neutrinos to the particle content of the model further
increases the signal since it opens a direct annihilation channel into
mono-energetic neutrinos. Neutrinos from the Galactic centre might be detected
for heavy WIMPs if the dark matter density at the Galactic centre is
substantially boosted.

nonlinearities on the intra-cavity light field. The scheme can be used for
optical switching or cross-phase modulation of the cavity-atom polariton at
ultra-low light levels, which may be useful for applications in quantum state
manipulation in cavity QED, quantum measurements, and quantum logic gates.

of individuals represented by diploid genomes. A series of eight bits formed an
allele occupying one of 128 loci of one haploid genome (chromosome). The
environment required a specific activity of each locus, this being the sum of
the activities of both alleles located at the corresponding loci on two
chromosomes. This activity is represented by the number of bits set to zero. In
a constant environment the best fitted individuals were homozygous with
alleles' activities corresponding to half of the environment requirement for a
locus (in diploid genome two alleles at corresponding loci produced a proper
activity). Changing the environment under a relatively low recombination rate
promotes generation of more polymorphic alleles. In the heterozygous loci,
alleles of different activities complement each other fulfilling the
environment requirements. Nevertheless, the genetic pool of populations evolves
in the direction of a very restricted number of complementing haplotypes and a
fast changing environment kills the population. If simulations start with all
loci heterozygous, they stay heterozygous for a long time.

energy having no special relativistic analogue is, however, not mechanical in

rescaling of the wavefunctional representing the Hilbert-Palatini theory, as in

with possibly different probabilities, and assume that the minimum expected
degree is omega(ln n). We prove that the adjacency matrix and the Laplacian of
that random graph are concentrated around the corresponding matrices of the
weighted graph whose edge weights are the probabilities in the random model.
While this may seem surprising, we will see that this matrix concentration
phenomenon is a generalization of known results about the Er\""{o}s-R\'{e}nyi
model. In particular, we will argue that matrix concentration is implicit the
theory of quasi-random graph properties.
  We present two main applications of the main result. In bond percolation over
a graph G, we show that the Laplacian of the random subgraph is typically very
close to the Laplacian of G. As a corollary, we improve upon a bound for the
spectral gap due to Chung and Horn that was derived via much more complicated
methods.
  In inhomogeneous random graphs, there are points X_1,...,X_n uniformly
distributed on the interval [0,1] and each pair is connected with probability p
kappa(X_i,X_j). We show that if \ln n/n<< p<< 1 and kappa is bounded, then the
adjacency matrix of the random graph is close to an integral operator defined
in terms of kappa.
  Our main proof tool is a new concentration inequality for matrix martingales
that generalizes Freedman's inequality for the standard scalar setting.
