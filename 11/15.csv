microlensing events that is based on the image centered ray shooting approach
of Bennett and Rhie. It has been used to model all a wide variety of binary and
triple lens systems, but it is designed to efficiently model high-magnification
planetary microlensing events, because these are, by far, the most challenging
events to model. It is designed to be efficient enough to handle microlensing
events with more than two lens masses and lens orbital motion. This method uses
a polar coordinate integration grid with a smaller grid spacing in the radial
direction than in the angular direction, and it employs an integration scheme
specifically designed to handle limb darkened sources. I present tests that
show that these features achieve second order accuracy for the light curves of
a number of high-magnification planetary events. They improve the precision of
the calculations by a factor of >100 compared to first order integration
schemes with the same grid spacing in both directions (for a fixed number of
grid points). This method also includes a Metropolis algorithm chi^2
minimization method that allows the jump function to vary in a way that allows
quick convergence to chi^2 minima. Finally, I introduce a global parameter
space search strategy that allows a blind search of parameter space for light
curve models without requiring chi^2 minimization over a large grid of fixed
parameters. Instead, the parameter space is explored on a grid of initial
conditions for a set of chi^2 minimizations using the full parameter space.
While this method may be faster than methods that find the chi^2 minima over a
large grid of parameters, I argue that the main strength of this method is for
events with the signals of multiple planets, where a much higher dimensional
parameter space must be explored to find the correct light curve model.

compressed sensing, subset selection in linear regression, estimation of
structures in graphical models, and signal denoising. This paper generalizes
the notion of \emph{incoherence} in the existing literature on model selection
and introduces two fundamental measures of coherence---termed as the worst-case
coherence and the average coherence---among the columns of a design matrix. In
particular, it utilizes these two measures of coherence to provide an in-depth
analysis of a simple one-step thresholding (OST) algorithm for model selection.
One of the key insights offered by the ensuing analysis is that OST is feasible
for model selection as long as the design matrix obeys an easily verifiable
property. In addition, the paper also characterizes the model-selection
performance of OST in terms of the worst-case coherence, \mu, and establishes
that OST performs near-optimally in the low signal-to-noise ratio regime for N
x C design matrices with \mu = O(N^{-1/2}). Finally, in contrast to some of the
existing literature on model selection, the analysis in the paper is
nonasymptotic in nature, it does not require knowledge of the true model order,
it is applicable to generic (random or deterministic) design matrices, and it
neither requires submatrices of the design matrix to have full rank, nor does
it assume a statistical prior on the values of the nonzero entries of the data
vector.

  First, we address the longstanding problem of finding a string theory
realisation of the axion. Using warped compactifications in heterotic string
theory, we show that the axion decay constant can be lowered to acceptable
values by the warp factor. Next, we move to the subject of cosmic strings,
whose network evolution could have important consequences for astrophysics and
cosmology. In particular, there are quantitative differences between cosmic
superstring networks and GUT cosmic string networks. We investigate the
properties of cosmic superstring networks in warped backgrounds, giving the
tension and properties of three-string junctions in these backgrounds. Finally,
we examine the possibility that cosmic strings in heterotic string theory could
be responsible for generating the galactic magnetic fields that seeded those
observed today.

which admit non-uniform contributions of observed events. They are introduced
in a general form covering not only the distances of discrete and continuous
stochastic observations, but also the distances of random processes and
signals. It is shown that the scaled Bregman distances extend not only the
classical ones studied in the previous literature, but also the information
divergence and the related wider class of convex divergences of probability
measures. An information processing theorem is established too, but only in the
sense of invariance w.r.t. statistically sufficient transformations and not in
the sense of universal monotonicity. Pathological situations where coding can
increase the classical Bregman distance are illustrated by a concrete example.
In addition to the classical areas of application of the Bregman distances and
convex divergences such as recognition, classification, learning and evaluation
of proximity of various features and signals, the paper mentions a new
application in 3D-exploratory data analysis. Explicit expressions for the
scaled Bregman distances are obtained in general exponential families, with
concrete applications in the binomial, Poisson and Rayleigh families, and in
the families of exponential processes such as the Poisson and diffusion
processes including the classical examples of the Wiener process and geometric
Brownian motion.

population of small mass halos may be suppressed by radiative feedback loops
operating over cosmological distance scales. If early populations of dwarf
galaxies did form in significant number, their relics should be found today in
the Local Group. These relics have been termed ""fossils of the first galaxies"".
This paper is a review that summarizes our ongoing efforts to simulate and
identify these fossils around the Milky Way and Andromeda.
  It is widely believed that reionization of the intergalactic medium would
have stopped star formation in the fossils of the first galaxies. Thus, they
should be among the oldest objects in the Universe. However, here we dispute
this idea and discuss a physical mechanism whereby relatively recent episodes
of gas accretion and star formation would be produced in some fossils of the
first galaxies. We argue that fossils may be characterized either by a single
old population of stars or by a bimodal star formation history. We also propose
that the same mechanism could turn small mass dark halos formed before
reionization into gas-rich but starless ""dark galaxies"".
  We believe that current observational data support the thesis that a fraction
of the new ultra-faint dwarfs recently discovered in the Local Group are in
fact fossils of the first galaxies.

that 90% of the BCGs are located within 0.035 r_500 of the peak of the X-ray
emission, including all of the cool core (CC) clusters. We also found an
unexpected correlation between the BCG metric luminosity and the core gas
density for non-cool core (non-CC) clusters, following a power law of n_e
\propto L_BCG^2.7+-0.4 (where n_e is measured at 0.008 r_500). The correlation
is not easily explained by star formation (which is weak in non-CC clusters) or
overall cluster mass (which is not correlated with core gas density). The trend
persists even when the BCG is not located near the peak of the X-ray emission,
so proximity is not necessary. We suggest that, for non-CC clusters, this
correlation implies that the same process that sets the central entropy of the
cluster gas also determines the central stellar density of the BCG, and that
this underlying physical process is likely to be mergers.

schemes in the sense that it provides comparable approximation rates to those
of the linear schemes, but to a larger class of approximands. This was
established for spline approximations and for wavelet approximations, and more
recently by DeVore and Ron for homogeneous radial basis function (surface
spline) approximations. However, no such results are known for the Gaussian
function, the preferred kernel in machine learning and several engineering
problems. We introduce and analyze in this paper a new algorithm for
approximating functions using translates of Gaussian functions with varying
tension parameters. At heart it employs the strategy for nonlinear
approximation of DeVore and Ron, but it selects kernels by a method that is not
straightforward. The crux of the difficulty lies in the necessity to vary the
tension parameter in the Gaussian function spatially according to local
information about the approximand: error analysis of Gaussian approximation
schemes with varying tension are, by and large, an elusive target for
approximators. We show that our algorithm is suitably optimal in the sense that
it provides approximation rates similar to other established nonlinear
methodologies like spline and wavelet approximations. As expected and desired,
the approximation rates can be as high as needed and are essentially saturated
only by the smoothness of the approximand.

enhancing the performance of quantum key distribution systems with practical
light sources. While active modulation of the intensity of the laser pulses is
an effective way of preparing decoy states in principle, in practice passive
preparation might be desirable in some scenarios. Typical passive schemes
involve parametric down-conversion. More recently, it has been shown that phase
randomized weak coherent pulses (WCP) can also be used for the same purpose [M.
Curty {\it et al.}, Opt. Lett. {\bf 34}, 3238 (2009).] This proposal requires
only linear optics together with a simple threshold photon detector, which
shows the practical feasibility of the method. Most importantly, the resulting
secret key rate is comparable to the one delivered by an active decoy state
setup with an infinite number of decoy settings. In this paper we extend these
results, now showing specifically the analysis for other practical scenarios
with different light sources and photo-detectors. In particular, we consider
sources emitting thermal states, phase randomized WCP, and strong coherent
light in combination with several types of photo-detectors, like, for instance,
threshold photon detectors, photon number resolving detectors, and classical
photo-detectors. Our analysis includes as well the effect that detection
inefficiencies and noise in the form of dark counts shown by current threshold
detectors might have on the final secret ket rate. Moreover, we provide
estimations on the effects that statistical fluctuations due to a finite data
size can have in practical implementations.

clear, linear inverse relationship has been found in the sample between the
pulsation period and the effective temperature and also an inverse linear
relationship between the amplitude of light variation and the effective
temperature. These are consistent with the expectation for a pulsating post-AGB
star evolving toward higher temperature at constant luminosity. The published
spectral energy distributions and mid-infrared images show these objects to
have cool (200 K), detached dust shells and published models imply that
intensive mass loss ended a few thousand years ago. The detection of periods as
long as 150 d in these requires a revision in the published post-AGB evolution
models that couple the pulsation period to the mass loss rate and that assume
that intensive mass loss ended when the pulsation period had decreased to 100
d. This revision will have the effect of extending the time scale for the early
phases of post-AGB evolution. It appears that real time evolution in the
pulsation periods of individual objects may be detectable on the time scale of
two decades.

the theoretical PL relation of current uncertainties on the chemical abundances

adopted in the evolutionary models. We analysed how the different factors
influence the evolutionary and pulsational observables and the resulting PL
relation. As a result, we found that present uncertainties on the most relevant
H and He burning reaction rates do not influence in a relevant way the loop
extension in temperature. On the contrary, current uncertainties on the LMC
chemical composition significantly affect the loop extension and also reflect
in the morphology of the instability strip; however their influence on the
predicted pulsational parameters is negligible. We also discussed how
overshooting and mass loss influence the ML relation and the pulsational
parameters. In summary, the present uncertainties on the physical inputs
adopted in the evolutionary codes and in the LMC chemical composition are
negligible for the prediction of the main pulsational properties; the inclusion
of overshooting in the previous H burning phase and/or of mass loss is expected
to significantly change the resulting theoretical pulsational scenario for
Cepheids, as well as the calibration of their distance scale. These systematic

Nash bargaining (NB)-based precoding games for multi-user systems, which aim at
maximizing the information rates of all users, are simplified to the
corresponding cooperative resource allocation games. The latter provides
additional practically desired simplifications to transmitter design and
significantly reduces the overhead during user cooperation. The complexity of
the corresponding precoding/resource allocation games, however, depends on the
constraints imposed on the users. If only spectral mask constraints are
present, the corresponding cooperative NB problem can be formulated as a convex
optimization problem and solved efficiently in a distributed manner using dual
decomposition based algorithm. However, the NB problem is non-convex if total
power constraints are also imposed on the users. In this case, the complexity
associate with finding the NB solution is unacceptably high. Therefore, the
multi-user systems are categorized into bandwidth- and power-dominant based on
a bottleneck resource, and different manners of cooperation are developed for
each type of systems for the case of two-users. Such classification guarantees

evaluated on several real-world data sets and compared to placement by

  We test two versions of the placement algorithm, one slow and more accurate
where branch length optimization is conducted for each short read insertion and
a faster version where the branch lengths are approximated at the insertion
position. For the slow version, additional heuristic techniques are explored
that almost yield the same run time as the fast version, with only a small loss
of accuracy. When those additional heuristics are employed the run time of the
more accurate algorithm is comparable to that of a simple BLAST search for data
sets with a high number of short query sequences. Moreover, the accuracy of the
Evolutionary Placement Algorithm is significantly higher, in particular when
the taxon sampling of the reference topology is sparse or inadequate. Our

one-body and many-body problems, we examine their relation in a number of
different situations. We derive, for a particle in a container of arbitrary
shape with a short-range scattering center, a general result for the energy
eigenvalues in terms of the s-wave scattering phase shift and the eigenstates
in the absence of the scatterer. We show that, while the energy shifts for a
spherical container are proportional to the phase shift over large ranges,
those for a cubic container have a more complicated behavior. We connect our
result to the description of energy shifts in terms of the scattering T-matrix.
The general relation is extended to problems of particles in traps with
smoothly varying potentials, including, e.g., the interaction of a small
neutral atom with a Rydberg atom. We then consider the many-body problem for
particles with a two-body interaction and show that the free energy change due
to the interaction is proportional to an average of a generalized phase shift
that includes the effects of the medium. Finally, we discuss why, even though
individual energy levels are very sensitive to boundary conditions, the energy
of a many-body system is not.

Mordell-Weil group of an elliptic curve E equals the order of vanishing at the
central point of the associated L-function L(s,E). Previous investigations have
focused on bounding how far we must go above the central point to be assured of
finding a zero, bounding the rank of a fixed curve or on bounding the average
rank in a family. Mestre showed the first zero occurs by O(1/loglog(N_E)),
where N_E is the conductor of E, though we expect the correct scale to study
the zeros near the central point is the significantly smaller 1/log(N_E). We
significantly improve on Mestre's result by averaging over a one-parameter
family of elliptic curves, obtaining non-trivial upper and lower bounds for the
average number of normalized zeros in intervals on the order of 1/log(N_E)
(which is the expected scale). Our results may be interpreted as providing
further evidence in support of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, as
well as the Katz-Sarnak density conjecture from random matrix theory (as the
number of zeros predicted by random matrix theory lies between our upper and
lower bounds). These methods may be applied to additional families of

between multiple stochastic processes. We discuss two possible frameworks in
which the problem can be studied: directed information theory and Granger
causality. The main goal of the paper is to study the connection between these
two frameworks. In the case of directed information theory, we stress the
importance of Kramer's causal conditioning. This type of conditioning is
necessary not only in the definition of the directed information but also for
handling causal side information. We also show how directed information
decomposes into the sum of two measures, the first one related to Schreiber's
transfer entropy quantifies the dynamical aspects of causality, whereas the
second one, termed instantaneous information exchange, quantifies the
instantaneous aspect of causality. After having recalled the definition of
Granger causality, we establish its connection with directed information
theory. The connection is particularly studied in the Gaussian case, showing
that Geweke's measures of Granger causality correspond to the transfer entropy
and the instantaneous information exchange. This allows to propose an
information theoretic formulation of Granger causality.

N=1, D=4 Supergravity potential obtained from type II orientifold models that
are T-duality invariant, in the presence of generalised fluxes. Based on our
previous work on algebras spanned by fluxes, and the so-called no-go theorems
on the existence of Minkowski and/or de Sitter vacua, we perform a partly
analytic, partly numerical analysis of the promising cases previously hinted.
We find that the models contain Minkowski extrema with one tachyonic direction.
Moreover, those models defined by the Supergravity algebra so(3,1)^2 also
contain Minkowski/de Sitter minima that are totally stable. All Minkowski
solutions, stable or not, interpolate between points in parameter space where
one or several of the moduli go to either zero or infinity, the so-called
singular points. We finally reinterpret our results in the language of type IIA
flux models, in order to show explicitly the contribution of the different
sources of potential energy to the extrema found. In particular, the cases of
totally stable Minkowski/de Sitter vacua require of the presence of
non-geometric fluxes.

of the finite transverse size on the vacuum of the quantized charged massive
scalar field which is subject to the Dirichlet boundary condition at the tube.
It is shown that, if the Compton wavelength associated with the scalar field
exceeds considerably the transverse size of the tube, then the vacuum energy
which is finite and periodic in the value of the magnetic flux enclosed in the
tube is induced on a plane transverse to the tube. Some consequences for
generic features of the vacuum polarization in the cosmic-string background are
discussed.

anisotropy. Here we explore changes in the resistivity anisotropy of epitaxial
SrRuO3 films due to induced magnetization in the paramagnetic state by using
the planar Hall effect. We find that the effect of the induced magnetization on
the in-plane anisotropy is strongly angular dependent, and we provide a full
description of this behavior at 160 K for induced magnetization in the (001)

decoupling solutions for the ghost and gluon propagators in the Landau gauge
Yang-Mills theory. We point out a few issues to be clarified, which seems to be
overlooked in the previous investigations in this field, in the fully
non-perturbative treatment. We propose a trick which enables one to incorporate
the Gribov horizon directly into the self-consistent Schwinger-Dyson equation
in the gauge-fixed Yang-Mills theory, using the Gribov-Zwanziger framework with
the horizon term. We obtain the following results, irrespective of the choice
of the horizon term. (i) We find that there exists a family of solutions
parameterized by one-parameter $w_R(0)$ which was assumed to be zero
implicitly. The family includes both the scaling and decoupling solutions, and
specification of the parameter discriminates between them. (ii) We observe that
the inclusion of the horizon term cancels the ultraviolet divergence in the
Schwinger-Dyson equation for the ghost propagator and the resulting
(non-perturbative) self-consistent solution becomes ultraviolet finite. In
other words, the horizon condition interpolates between the infrared behavior
and the ultraviolet one. This leads to the incompatibility of the conventional
multiplicative renormalization scheme with the Gribov
