next show that the previously reported ACW signal is also present in the 1-year
WMAP temperature sky map presented by Liu & Li, where data cuts are more
aggressive. Finally, we reanalyze the 5-year WMAP data taking into account a
previously neglected (-i)^{l-l'}-term in the signal covariance matrix. We still
find a strong detection of a preferred direction in the temperature map.
Including multipoles up to l=400, the anisotropy amplitude for the W-band is
found to be g = 0.29 +- 0.031, nonzero at 9 sigma. However, the corresponding
preferred direction is also shifted very close to the ecliptic poles at (l,b)=
(96,30), in agreement with the analysis of Hanson & Lewis, indicating that the
signal is aligned along the plane of the solar system. This strongly suggests
that the signal is not of cosmological origin, but most likely is a product of
an unknown systematic effect. Determining the nature of the systematic effect
is of vital importance, as it might affect other cosmological conclusions from

models based on numerical integrations of the full equations of motion show
that Aegaeon's orbital motion is strongly influenced by multiple resonances
with Mimas. In particular, like the G-ring arc it inhabits, Aegaeon is trapped
in the 7:6 corotation eccentricity resonance with Mimas. Aegaeon, Anthe and
Methone therefore form a distinctive class of objects in the Saturn system:
small moons in co-rotation eccentricity resonances with Mimas associated with
arcs of debris. Comparisons among these different ring-arc systems reveal that
Aegaeon's orbit is closer to the exact resonance than Anthe's and Methone's
orbits are. This could indicate that Aegaeon has undergone significant orbital
evolution via its interactions with the other objects in its arc, which would
be consistent with the evidence that Aegaeon's mass is much smaller relative to

Part of our work is to justify why the definitions and results we describe here

Formalism (in the sense of R. Bowen, Y. Sinai and D. Ruelle). It is well-known
that the concept of density operator should replace the concept of measure for
the cases in which we consider a quantum formalism. We consider the operator
$\Lambda$ acting on the space of density matrices $\mathcal{M}_N$ over a finite
$N$-dimensional complex Hilbert space $$ \Lambda(\rho):=\sum_{i=1}^k tr(W_i\rho
W_i^*)\frac{V_i\rho V_i^*}{tr(V_i\rho V_i^*)}, $$ where $W_i$ and $V_i$,

(i.e., the dynamics on the configuration space of density matrices) and the
$W_i$ play the role of the weights one can consider on the IFS. In this way a
family $W:=\{W_i\}_{i=1,..., k}$ determines a Quantum Iterated Function System

rapidly time-varying channels, the orthogonality between subcarriers is
destroyed leading to inter-carrier interference (ICI) and resulting in an
irreducible error floor. In this paper, a new and low-complexity maximum {\em a

operating over rapidly time-varying multipath channels. The detection algorithm
exploits the banded structure of the frequency-domain channel matrix whose
bandwidth is a parameter to be adjusted according to the speed of the mobile
terminal. Based on this assumption, the received signal vector is decomposed
into reduced dimensional sub-observations in such a way that all components of
the observation vector contributing to the symbol to be detected are included
in the decomposed observation model. The data symbols are then detected by the
MAP algorithm by means of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique in an
optimal and computationally efficient way. Computational complexity
investigation as well as simulation results indicate that this algorithm has
significant performance and complexity advantages over existing suboptimal
detection and equalization algorithms proposed earlier in the literature.

distribution with a hot component and significant high energy continuum; narrow
emission lines from H- and He-like ions, as well as a range of Fe ions, and
relative luminosity, L_x/L_bol = 0.001. Density, while poorly constrained, is
consistent with the low density limits as determined from Mg XI and Ne IX
emission lines. Coronal elemental abundances are sub-Solar, with Ne being the
highest at about 0.4 times Solar. We find a possible trend in Trapezium hot

explain in terms of the dust depletion scenarios of low-mass young stars.
Variability was unusually low relative to other coronally active stars. The
emission is similar to post main-sequence G-stars. Coronal structures could be

since the last decade. This topic is very close to potential applications to
the so called Quantum Computer. In our point of view it makes sense to develop
a more ""dynamical point of view"" of this theory. We want to consider the
concepts of entropy and pressure for ""stationary systems"" acting on density
matrices which generalize the usual ones in Ergodic Theory (in the sense of the
Thermodynamic Formalism of R. Bowen, Y. Sinai and D. Ruelle). We consider the
operator $\mathcal{L}$ acting on density matrices $\rho\in \mathcal{M}_N$ over
a finite $N$-dimensional complex Hilbert space $\mathcal{L}(\rho):=\sum_{i=1}^k
tr(W_i\rho W_i^*)V_i\rho V_i^*,$ where $W_i$ and $V_i$, $i=1,2,... k$ are
operators in this Hilbert space. $\mathcal{L}$ is not a linear operator. In
some sense this operator is a version of an Iterated Function System (IFS).
Namely, the $V_i (.) V_i^*=:F_i(.)$, $i=1,2,...,k$, play the role of the
inverse branches (acting on the configuration space of density matrices $\rho$)
and the $W_i$ play the role of the weights one can consider on the IFS. We also
analyze the discrete Wigner function.
  We suppose that for all $\rho$ we have that $\sum_{i=1}^k tr(W_i\rho
W_i^*)=1$. A family $W:=\{W_i\}_{i=1,..., k}$ determines a Quantum Iterated
Function System (QIFS) $\mathcal{F}_{W}$,
$\mathcal{F}_W=\{\mathcal{M}_N,F_i,W_i\}_{i=1,..., k}.$

energy price to pay for breaking a Cooper pair of electrons. In high-Tc cuprate
superconductors above Tc, an energy gap called the pseudogap exists, and is
controversially attributed either to pre-formed superconducting pairs, which
would exhibit particle-hole symmetry, or to competing phases which would
typically break it. Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) studies suggest that
the pseudogap stems from lattice translational symmetry breaking and is
associated with a different characteristic spectrum for adding or removing
electrons (particle-hole asymmetry). However, no signature of either spatial or
energy symmetry breaking of the pseudogap has previously been observed by
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Here we report ARPES data
from Bi2201 which reveals both particle-hole symmetry breaking and dramatic
spectral broadening indicative of spatial symmetry breaking without long range
order, upon crossing through T* into the pseudogap state. This symmetry
breaking is found in the dominant region of the momentum space for the
pseudogap, around the so-called anti-node near the Brillouin zone boundary. Our
finding supports the STM conclusion that the pseudogap state is a
broken-symmetry state that is distinct from homogeneous superconductivity.

One
of the main questions in this area is the \emph{parallel repetition question}:
If the game is played $\ell$ times in parallel, does the maximum winning
probability decay exponentially in $\ell$? In the classical setting, this
question was answered in the affirmative by Raz. More recently the question
arose whether the decay is of the form $(1-\Theta(\eps))^\ell$ where $1-\eps$
is the value of the game and $\ell$ is the number of repetitions. This question
is known as the \emph{strong parallel repetition question} and was motivated by
its connections to the unique games conjecture. It was resolved by Raz who
showed that strong parallel repetition does \emph{not} hold, even in the very
special case of games known as XOR games.
  This opens the question whether strong parallel repetition holds in the case
when the provers share entanglement. Evidence for this is provided by the
behavior of XOR games, which have strong (in fact \emph{perfect}) parallel
repetition, and by the recently proved strong parallel repetition of linear
unique games. A similar question was open for games with so-called
non-signaling provers. Here the best known parallel repetition theorem is due
to Holenstein, and is of the form $(1-\Theta(\eps^2))^\ell$.
  We show that strong parallel repetition holds neither with entangled provers
nor with non-signaling provers. In particular we obtain that Holenstein's bound
is tight. Along the way we also provide a tight characterization of the
asymptotic behavior of the entangled value under parallel repetition of unique
games in terms of a semidefinite program.

the expression of 949 genes in the derived cell line. Age-associated genes
include over-representation of immune-related genes, specifically MHC Class I

associated genes in these cell lines include likely candidates, such as genes
that escape X-inactivation,testis specific expressed genes, androgen and
estrogen specific genes, but also gene families previously unknown to be sex
associated such as common microRNA targets (MIR-490, V_ARP1_01, MIR-489).
Finally, we report 494 transcripts whose expression levels are associated with
a genetic variant in cis, overlapping and validating previous reports.
Incorporating age in analysis of association facilitates additional discovery

reveal about cosmology and the small scale structure of dark matter relies in
large part on a more detailed interpretation of their internal kinematics. This
article discusses a likelihood formalism that extracts important quantities
from the kinematic data, including the amplitude of rotation, proper motion,
and the mass distribution. In the simplest model the projected error on the
rotational amplitude is shown to be $\sim 0.5 $ km s$^{-1}$ with $\sim 10^3$

analyzed for the presence of a rotational signal; no significant detection of
rotation is found, and given this result limits are derived on the Sculptor
proper motion. A criteria for model selection is discussed that determines the
parameters required to describe the dark matter halo density profiles and the
stellar velocity anisotropy. Applied to four data sets with a wide range of
velocities, the likelihood is found to be more sensitive to variations in the
slope of the dark matter density profile than variations in the velocity
anisotropy. Models with variable radial velocity anisotropy are shown to be
preferred relative to those in which this quantity is constant at all radii in
the galaxy.

large collection of very rudimentary dynamical agents through very simple local
interactions. However, it still remains elusive on how to design these local
interactions among agents so as to achieve certain desired collective
behaviors. This paper aims to tackle this challenge and proposes a
divide-and-conquer approach to guarantee specified global behaviors through
local coordination and control design for multi-agent systems. The basic idea
is to decompose the requested global specification into subtasks for each
individual agent. It should be noted that the decomposition is not arbitrary.
The global specification should be decomposed in such a way that the fulfilment
of these subtasks by each individual agent will imply the satisfaction of the
global specification as a team. First, it is shown by a counterexample that not
all specifications can be decomposed in this sense. Then, a natural follow-up
question is what the necessary and sufficient condition should be for the
proposed decomposability of a global specification. The main part of the paper
is set to answer this question. The case of two cooperative agents is
investigated first, and a necessary and sufficient condition is presented and
proven. Later on, the result is generalized to the case of arbitrary finite
number of agents, and a hierarchical algorithm is proposed, which is shown to
be a sufficient condition. Finally, a cooperative control scenario for a team
of three robots is developed to illustrate the task decomposition procedure.

Mol. Opt. Phys. 42 (2009) 015102). Three sets of calculations have been
undertaken: single-channel, multichannel without Coriolis couplings and full
multichannel with Coriolis couplings. We find that non-adiabatic effects are
negligible for $0^-_u,0^{\pm}_g,1_u,2_g,2_u,3_g$ Hund case (c) sets of levels
in the j=2 asymptote but can be up to 15% for some of the $0^+_u$ and $1_g$
sets of levels where near degeneracies are present in the single-channel
diagonalized potentials. Coriolis couplings are most significant for weakly
bound levels, ranging from 1-5% for total angular momenta J=1,2 and up to 10%
for J=3. Levels near the j=1 and j=0 asymptotes agree closely with previous
multichannel calculations based upon long-range potentials constructed from
retarded resonance dipole and dispersion interactions. Assignment of
theoretical levels to experimental observations using criteria based upon the
short-range character of each level and their coupling to metastable ground
states produces well matched assignments for the majority of observations.
After a 1% increase in the slope of the $^5\Sigma^+_{g,u}$ and $^5\Pi_{g,u}$
input potentials near the classical turning point is applied, improved matching
of previous assignments is obtained and further assignments can be made,
reproducing very closely the number of experimental observations.

evolution in protoplanetary disks. In this study, we present useful tools to
study the coagulation and porosity evolution of dust aggregates. First, we
present a new numerical method for simulating dust coagulation and porosity
evolution as an extension of the conventional Smoluchowski equation. This
method follows the evolution of the mean porosity for each aggregate mass
simultaneously with the evolution of the mass distribution function. This
method reproduces the results of previous Monte Carlo simulations with much
less computational expense. Second, we propose a new collision model for porous
dust aggregates on the basis of our N-body experiments on aggregate collisions.
We first obtain empirical data on porosity changes between the classical limits
of ballistic cluster-cluster and particle-cluster aggregation. Using the data,
we construct a recipe for the porosity change due to general hit-and-stick
collisions as well as formulae for the aerodynamical and collisional cross
sections. Simple coagulation simulations using the extended Smoluchowski method
show that our collision model explains the fractal dimensions of porous
aggregates observed in a full N-body simulation and a laboratory experiment.
Besides, we discover that aggregates at the high-mass end of the distribution
can have a considerably small aerodynamical cross section per unit mass
compared with aggregates of lower masses. We point out an important implication
of this discovery for dust growth in protoplanetary disks.

by constructing such a game for eikonal equations whose speed has a
non-constant sign. This provides a (discrete) deterministic control
interpretation of these evolution equations. In all our games, two players
choose positions successively, and their final payoff is determined by their
positions and additional parameters of choice. Because of the non-locality of
the problems approximated, by contrast with local problems, their choices have
to ""collect"" information far from their current position. For integral
curvature flows, players choose hypersurfaces in the whole space and positions
on these hypersurfaces. For parabolic integro-differential equations, players
choose smooth functions on the whole space.

protons, antiprotons, Kaons, antiKaons, pions, the ratios lambdabar/lambda and
cascadebar/cascade. The experimental data set on p, pbar, K, Kbar and Pion
provided by BRAHMS collaboration at the highest energy of Relativistic Heavy

field recognition in galactic disks where the magnetic field is supposed to
have a maximum in the equatorial plane. The method is quite simple when applied
to a single Faraday-rotating structure on the line of sight. Recognition of
several structures on the same line of sight requires a more sophisticated

spectra of 10 AGN, which have been observed by RXTE regularly over a long
period of time ~ 7-11 years. These observations most probably sample most of
the flux and spectral variations that these objects exhibit, thus, they are
ideal for the study of their long term X-ray spectral variability. We modelled
the 3-10 spectrum of each observation in a uniform way using a simple power-law
model (with the addition of Gaussian line and/or edge to model the iron Kalpha
emission/absorption features, if necessary) to consistently parametrize the
shape of the observed X-ray continuum. We found that the average spectral slope
does not correlate with source luminosity or black hole mass, while it
correlates positively with the average accretion rate. We have also determined
the (positive) ""spectral slope-flux"" relation for each object, over a larger
flux range than before. We found that this correlation is similar in almost all
objects. We discuss this global ""spectral slope-flux"" trend in the light of
current models for spectral variability. We consider (i) intrinsic variability,
expected e.g. from Comptonization processes, (ii) variability caused by
absorption of X-rays by a single absorber whose ionization parameter varies
proportionally to the continuum flux variations, (iii) variability resulting
from the superposition of a constant reflection component and an intrinsic
power-law which is variable in flux but constant in shape, and, (iv)
variability resulting from the superposition of a constant reflection component
and an intrinsic power-law which is variable both in flux and shape. Our final
conclusion is that scenario (iv) describes better our results.

Weyl integrable five-dimensional space-time, which is a generalization of
Riemann geometry and is invariant under a so-called Weyl rescaling. We find a
solution of this model via performing a conformal transformation to map the
Weylian structure into a familiar Riemannian one with a conformal metric. The
metric perturbations of the model are discussed. For gravitational
perturbation, we get the effective modified P$\ddot{\text{o}}$schl-Teller

Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes of the graviton. There is only one bound state, which
is a normalizable massless zero mode and represents a stable 4-dimensional
graviton. Furthermore, there exists a mass gap between the massless mode and
continuous KK modes. We also find that the model is stable under the scalar
perturbation in the metric. The correction to the Newtonian potential on the
brane is proportional to $e^{-3 r \beta/2}/r^2$, where $\beta$ is the de Sitter
parameter of the brane. This is very different from the correction caused by a

observed a resistivity drop at $T_c\sim$ 21 K, which shifts toward lower
temperatures under external fields, suggesting a superconducting transition.
The upper critical fields near $T_c$ show large anisotropy, in contrast with
those of other '122' FeAs-based superconductors. Low-field magnetic
susceptibility data also show evidence of superconductivity below 21 K. Instead
of expected zero-resistance below $T_c$, however, a resistivity reentrance
appears at 17 K under zero field, coincident with the magnetic ordering of
Eu$^{2+}$ moments. Based on the temperature and field dependences of
anisotropic magnetization, a helical magnetic structure for the Eu$^{2+}$ spins
is proposed. External magnetic fields easily changes the helimagnetism into a
ferromagnetism with fully polarized Eu$^{2+}$ spins, accompanying by
disappearance of the resistivity reentrance. Therefore, superconductivity
coexists with ferromagnetic state of Eu$^{2+}$ spins under relatively low
magnetic field. The magnetic and superconducting phase diagrams are finally
summarized for both $H\parallel ab$ and $H\parallel c$.

sample of the joint distribution is an important problem in science. Recently,
methods using additive noise models have been suggested to approach the case of
continuous variables. In many situations, however, the variables of interest
are discrete or even have only finitely many states. In this work we extend the
notion of additive noise models to these cases. We prove that whenever the
joint distribution $\prob^{(X,Y)}$ admits such a model in one direction, e.g.
$Y=f(X)+N, N \independent X$, it does not admit the reversed model
$X=g(Y)+\tilde N, \tilde N \independent Y$ as long as the model is chosen in a
generic way. Based on these deliberations we propose an efficient new algorithm
that is able to distinguish between cause and effect for a finite sample of

data from the 2005 hard state outburst of the black hole SWIFT J1753.5-0127.
This system is both fairly bright and has fairly low interstellar absorption,
so gives one of the best datasets to study the weak, cool disc emission in this
state. We fit these data using models of an X-ray illuminated disc to constrain
the inner disc radius throughout the outburst. Close to the peak, the observed
soft X-ray component is consistent with being produced by the inner disc, with
its intrinsic emission enhanced in temperature and luminosity by reprocessing
of hard X-ray illumination in an overlap region between the disc and corona.
This disc emission provides the seed photons for Compton scattering to produce
the hard X-ray spectrum, and these hard X-rays also illuminate the outer disc,
producing the optical emission by reprocessing.
  However, the situation is very different as the outburst declines. The
optical is probably cyclo-synchrotron radiation, self-generated by the flow,
rather than tracing the outer disc. Similarly, limits from reprocessing make it
unlikely that the soft X-rays are directly tracing the inner disc radius. This
is seen more clearly in a similarly dim low/hard state spectrum from XTE
J1118+480. The very small emitting area implied by the relatively high
temperature soft X-ray component is completely inconsistent with the much
larger, cooler, UV component which is well fit by a truncated disc. We
speculate on the origin of this component, but its existence as a clearly
separate spectral component from the truncated disc in XTE J1118+480 shows that
it does not simply trace the inner disc radius, so cannot constrain the
truncated disc models.

discs in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). However, the role of encounters in
other cluster environments is less known. We investigate the effect of the
encounter-induced disc-mass loss in different cluster environments. Starting
from an ONC-like cluster we vary the cluster size and density to determine the
correlation of collision time scale and disc-mass loss. We use the NBODY6++
code to model the dynamics of these clusters and analyze the effect of
star-disc encounters. We find that the disc-mass loss depends strongly on the
cluster density but remains rather unaffected by the size of the stellar
population. The essential outcome of the simulations are: i) Even in clusters
four times sparser than the ONC the effect of encounters is still apparent. ii)
The density of the ONC itself marks a threshold: in less dense and less massive
clusters it is the massive stars that dominate the encounter-induced disc-mass
loss whereas in denser and more massive clusters the low-mass stars play the
major role for the disc mass removal. It seems that in the central regions of
young dense star clusters -- the common sites of star formation -- stellar
encounters do affect the evolution of the protoplanetary discs. With higher
cluster density low-mass stars become more heavily involved in this process.
This finding allows for the extrapolation towards extreme stellar systems: in
case of the Arches cluster one would expect stellar encounters to destroy the
discs of most of the low- and high-mass stars in several hundred thousand
years, whereas intermediate mass stars are able to retain to some extant their
discs even under these harsh environmental conditions.

a noncentrosymmetric (NCS) superconductor. In this article we have considered a
planar ferromagnetic metal/NCS superconductor tunnel junction and have studied
the effect of these helical edge states which manifests itself through the
charge and spin tunneling conductance across the junction. We have shown the
behavior of conductances for the entire range of variation of $\gamma =
\Delta_-/\Delta_+$ where $\Delta_\pm$ are the order parameters in the positive
and negative helicity bands of the NCS superconductor.There exists a
competition between the Rashba parameter $\alpha$ and the exchange energy
$E_{ex}$ which is crucial for determining the variation of the conductance with
the applied bias voltage across the junction. We have found a nonzero spin
current across the junction which appears due to the exchange energy in the
Ferromagnet and modulates with the bias voltage. It also changes its profile
when the strength of the exchange energy is varied.

winds is proportional to the local Keplerian rotation period, a gas disk
dynamically evaporates from the inner region with possibly creating a gradually
expanding inner hole, while a sizable amount of the gas remains in the outer
region. The disk wind is highly time-dependent with quasi-periodicity of
several times Keplerian rotation period at each radius, which will be observed
as time-variability of protostar-protoplanetary disk systems. These features
persistently hold even if a dead zone exists because the disk winds are driven
from the surface regions where ionizing cosmic rays and high energy photons can
penetrate. Moreover, the predicted inside-out clearing significantly suppresses
the infall of boulders to a central star and the Type I migration of
proto-planets which are favorable for the formation and survival of planets.

of purely collisional electron beam propagation, ignoring spatial evolution and
collective effects. In this paper we present self-consistent numerical
simulations of the spatial and temporal evolution of an electron beam subject
to collisional transport and beam-driven Langmuir wave turbulence. These
wave-particle interactions represent the background plasma's response to the
electron beam propagating from the corona to chromosphere and occur on a far
faster timescale than coulomb collisions. From these simulations we derive the
mean electron flux spectrum, comparable to such spectra recovered from high
resolution hard X-rays observations of solar flares with RHESSI. We find that a
negative spectral index (i.e. a spectrum that increases with energy), or local
minima when including the expected thermal spectral component at low energies,
occurs in the standard thick-target model, when coulomb collisions are only
considered. The inclusion of wave-particle interactions does not produce a
local minimum, maintaining a positive spectral index. These simulations are a
step towards a more complete treatment of electron transport in solar flares
and suggest that a flat spectrum (spectral index of 0 to 1) down to thermal
energies maybe a better approximation instead of a sharp cut-off in the
injected electron spectrum.

the (background) Landau gauge \Lambda_{\mu\nu}(q) fully constrains the QCD

confirming its validity has been presented yet. We recently started an
observational project to obtain constraints on the time-scales of variability
associated to this extra line-broadening and its possible origin. Our
observational strategy consists of the study of a well selected group of O and
B stars, for which we obtain time series of high-quality spectra. We present
some preliminary results from our first campaign with FIES@NOT2.5m.

produce highly magnetized (Poynting flux dominated) outflows expanding in a
dense surrounding (interstellar medium or stellar material). For certain
injection conditions, the magnetic flux of the wind cannot be accommodated
within the cavity. In this case, ideal (non-dissipative) MHD models, similar to
the Kennel and Coroniti (1984) model of the Crab nebular, break down (the
so-called sigma problem). This is typically taken to imply that the wind should
become particle-dominated on scales much smaller than the size of the cavity.
The wind is then slowed down by a fluid-type (low magnetization) reverse shock.
Recent Fermi results, indicating that synchrotron spectrum of the Crab nebula
extends well beyond the upper limit of the most efficient radiation
reaction-limited acceleration, contradict the presence of a low sigma reverse
shock.
  We propose an alternative possibility, that the excessive magnetic flux is
destroyed in a reconnection-like process in two regions: near the rotational
axis and near the equator. We construct an example of such highly magnetized
wind having two distinct reconnection regions and suggest that these
reconnection cites are observed as tori and jets in pulsar wind nebulae. The
model reproduces, qualitatively, the observed morphology of the Crab nebula. In
parts of the nebular the dissipation occurs in a relativistically moving wind,
alleviating the requirements on the acceleration rate.

grains in the ISM are reported. Calculations using Discrete Dipole
Approximation (DDA) for varying ellipsoidal shapes and sizes from 2.5 to $10
nm$ are considered. Nanodiamonds show negligible extinction from IR to near-UV
and very sharp far-UV rise. Comparison with observations rule out possibility
of independent nanodiamond dust but point towards possibility of nanodiamonds
as a component in the ISM. Radiation induced transformations may lead to
carbonaceous grains with different core and mantles. So calculations are also
performed for a core-mantle target model with nanodiamond core in graphite
mantles. The graphite extinction features get modified with the peak at 2175
\AA{} being lowered, broadened, blue shifted and accompanied by enhanced
extinction in the far-UV. Such variations in the 2175 \AA{} band and
simultaneous far-UV rise are observed along some sources. A three component
dust model incorporating silicate, graphite and graphite with nanodiamond core
is also considered. The model extinction compares very well with the average
galactic extinction in the complete range from 0.2 to $10 \mu m^{-1}$. The best
fit requires small size and small number of nanodiamonds.

In the framework of the exciton condensate phase, the detailed temperature

mean-field-like behaviour at low temperature, it exhibits a non-zero value
above the transition, interpreted as the signature of strong excitonic
fluctuations, reminiscent of the pseudo-gap phase of high temperature

display a trend similar to the measured resistivity and is discussed within the

presence of a controlled decoherence mechanism. A two-photon state, produced in
a spontaneous parametric down conversion process, is prepared in a maximally
entangled polarization state. A birefringent double-slit is illuminated by one
of the down-converted photons, and it acts as a single-photon two-qubits
controlled not gate that couples the polarization with the transversal momentum
of these photons. The other photon, that acts as a which-path marker, is sent
through a Mach-Zehnder-like interferometer. When the interferometer is
partially unbalanced, it behaves as a controlled source of decoherence for
polarization states of down-converted photons. We show the transition from
wave-like to particle-like behavior of the signal photons crossing the
double-slit as a function of the decoherence parameter, which depends on the
length path difference at the interferometer.
