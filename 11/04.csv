transformations and reference frame changes is formulated in the terms of fibre
bundles over the time-axis R. Connections on fibre bundles are the main
ingredient in this formulation of mechanics which thus is covariant under
reference frame transformations. The basic notions of a non-relativistic
reference frame, a relative velocity, a free motion equation, a relative
acceleration, an external force are formulated. Newtonian, Lagrangian,
Hamiltonian mechanical systems and the relations between them are defined.
Lagrangian and Hamiltonian conservation laws are considered.

detonation of a sub-Chandrasekhar CO white dwarf in a dynamically unstable
system where the secondary is either a pure He white dwarf or a He/CO hybrid.
For dynamically unstable systems where the accretion stream directly impacts
the surface of the primary, the final tens of orbits can have mass accretion
rates that range from $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-3} M_{\odot}$ s$^{-1}$, leading to the
rapid accumulation of helium on the surface of the primary. After $\sim
10^{-2}$ $M_{\odot}$ of helium has been accreted, the ram pressure of the hot
helium torus can deflect the accretion stream such that the stream no longer
directly impacts the surface. The velocity difference between the stream and
the torus produces shearing which seeds large-scale Kelvin-Helmholtz
instabilities along the interface between the two regions. These instabilities
eventually grow into dense knots of material that periodically strike the
surface of the primary, adiabatically compressing the underlying helium torus.
If the temperature of the compressed material is raised above a critical
temperature, the timescale for triple-$\alpha$ reactions becomes comparable to
the dynamical timescale, leading to the detonation of the primary's helium
envelope. This detonation drives shockwaves into the primary which tend to
concentrate at one or more focal points within the primary's CO core. If a
relatively small amount of mass is raised above a critical temperature and
density at these focal points, the CO core may itself be detonated.

compared the observational results with the existing theoretical models.
  We report variability in the three nearby wisps located to the northwest of
the pulsar and also in a nearby anvil wisp in terms of their structure,
position, and emissivity within the time window of 75 days. All the wisps and
the inner knot display red spectra with similar spectral indices. Similarly,
the interwisp medium regions also show red spectra similar to those of the
wisps. Also, based on archival HST data and our IR data, we find that the inner
knot remains stationary for a time period of 13.5 years. The projected average
velocity relative to the pulsar for this period is < 8 km/s.

offers - because of this material's relatively simple lattice structure and
valence configuration (d9, i.e., one hole in the d-shell) - a particularly
clear view of the essential role of the orbital degree of freedom in governing
the dynamical coupling between the spin and lattice degrees of freedom. We
present Raman and x-ray scattering evidence that the phase behaviour of KCuF3
is dominated above the Neel temperature (T_N = 40 K) by coupled orbital/lattice
fluctuations that are likely associated with rotations of the CuF6 octahedra,
and we show that these orbital fluctuations are interrupted by a static
structural distortion that occurs just above T_N. A detailed model of the
orbital and magnetic phases of KCuF3 reveals that these orbital fluctuations -
and the related frustration of in-plane spin-order-are associated with the
presence of nearly degenerate low-energy spin-orbital states that are highly
susceptible to thermal fluctuations over a wide range of temperatures. A
striking implication of these results is that the ground state of KCuF3 at
ambient pressure lies near a quantum critical point associated with an
orbital/spin liquid phase that is obscured by emergent Neel ordering of the

nuclear binding of neutrons and protons through the conventional measures
  $\Delta^{(3)}$. The large differences previously observed between these
trends for even and odd values of these measures is found to arise, in part,
from the slow variation of binding energies with mass and charge which provides
a background contribution. This background is estimated with the liquid-drop
model, and accounts for the greater difference found in proton removal relative
to neutron removal. The differences which persist after backgrounds are removed
can not be treated in the conventional liquid-drop model but require the
addition of a new term. Such a term is investigated, and its effect on specific
values of the OES is calcutated. The liquid-drop fitting is also applied to a
set of separation energies constrained to match the specific set of nuclei used
to determine the observed values for the odd $\Delta^{(3)}$. The resulting fit
for the pairing term is compared to the average value of even and odd measures.
The effect on this value of the new liquid-drop term is observed, and the
change in background when the new term is included is also used as an alternate
method for determining the difference between trends of the even and odd values
of the OES.

all three non-thermal components to total mass measurements of galaxy clusters:
cosmic rays, turbulence and magnetic pressures. To estimate the thermal
pressure we used public XMM-\textit{Newton} archival data of 5 Abell clusters.
To describe the magnetic pressure, we assume a radial distribution for the
magnetic field, $B(r) \propto \rho_{g}^{\alpha}$, to seek generality we assume
$\alpha$ within the range of 0.5 to 0.9, as indicated by observations and
numerical simulations. For the turbulent component, we assumed an isotropic
pressure, $P_{\rm turb} = {1/3}\rho_{\rm g}(\sigma_{r}^{2}+\sigma_{t}^{2})$. We
also consider the contribution of cosmic ray pressure, $P_{cr}\propto
r^{-0.5}$. It follows that a consistent description for the non-thermal
component could yield variation in mass estimates that vary from 10% up to
$\sim$30%. We verified that in the inner parts of cool-core clusters the cosmic
ray component is comparable to the magnetic pressure, while in non cool-core
cluster the cosmic ray component is dominant. For cool-core clusters the
magnetic pressure is the dominant component, contributing with more than 50% of
total mass variation due to non-thermal pressure components. However, for non
cool-core clusters, the major influence comes from the cosmic ray pressure that
accounts with more than 80% of total mass variation due to non-thermal pressure
effects. For our sample, the maximum influence of the turbulent component to
total mass variation can be almost 20%. We show that this analysis can be
regarded as a starting point for a more detailed and refined exploration of the
influence of non-thermal pressure in the intra-cluster medium (ICM).

ideal glass transition. Based on empirical evidence and several previous exact
calculations, we hypothesize that there exists an energy gap between the lowest
possible energy of a glass (the ideal glass IG) and the crystal (CR). The gap
is due to the presence of strongly correlated excitations with respect to the
ideal CR; thus, one can treat IG as a highly defective crystal. We argue that
an excitation in IG requires energy that increases logarithmically with the
size of the system; as a consequence, we prove that IG must emerge at a
positive temperature T_{K}. We propose an antiferromagnetic Ising model on a
lattice to model liquid-crystal transition in a simple fluid or a binary
mixture, which is then solved exactly on a recursive (Husimi) lattice to
investigate the ideal glass transition, the nature of defects in the
supercooled liquid and CR analytically, and the effects of competing
interactions on the glass transition. The calculation establishes the gap. The
lattice entropy of the supercooled liquid vanishes at a positive temperature
T_{K}>0, where IG emerges but where CR has a positive entropy. The macrostate
IG is in a particular and unique disordered microstate at T_{K}, just as the
ideal CR is in a perfectly ordered microstate at absolute zero. This explains
why it is possible for CR to have a higher entropy at T_{K} than IG. The
demonstration here of an entropy crisis in monatomic systems along with
previously known results strongly suggests that the entropy crisis first noted
by Kauzmann and demonstrated by Gibbs and DiMarzio in long polymers appears to
be ubiquitous in all supercooled liquids.

instability (SBI) in local shearing box models. We describe the 2D and 3D
behaviour of this instability using numerical simulations and we present a
simple analytical model describing the underlying physical process.
  Results: A subcritical baroclinic instability is observed in flows stable for
the Solberg-Hoiland criterion using local simulations. This instability is
found to be a nonlinear (or subcritical) instability, which cannot be described
by ordinary linear approaches. It requires a radial entropy gradient weakly
unstable for the Schwartzchild criterion and a strong thermal diffusivity (or
equivalently a short cooling time). In compressible simulations, the
instability produces density waves which transport angular momentum outward
with typically alpha<3e-3, the exact value depending on the background
temperature profile. Finally, the instability survives in 3D, vortex cores
becoming turbulent due to parametric instabilities.
  Conclusions: The subcritical baroclinic instability is a robust phenomenon,
which can be captured using local simulations. The instability survives in 3D
thanks to a balance between the 2D SBI and 3D parametric instabilities.
Finally, this instability can lead to a weak outward transport of angular
momentum, due to the generation of density waves by the vortices.

0.45+/-0.04 mas (0.039+/-0.003 pc). Strikingly, this matches independent radius
measurements from optical--infrared reverberations that are thought to be
probing the dust sublimation radius. We also show that the effective radius of
the other objects, obtained from the same ring model, is either roughly equal
to or slightly larger than the reverberation radius as a function of AGN

type IX (closed cosmologies) need not necessarily recollapse; there is an open
set of forever expanding solutions. (ii) Generic type IX solutions associated
with a matter model like Vlasov matter exhibit oscillatory behavior toward the

measuring the large-scale structure of the Universe. This requires a tracer of
the underlying dark matter which maximizes the useful volume of the survey. We
investigate two potential survey selection methods: an emission line sample
based on the \ha line and a sample selected in the H-band. We present
predictions for the abundance and clustering of such galaxies, using two
published versions of the \galform galaxy formation model. Our models predict
that \ha selected galaxies tend to avoid massive dark matter haloes and instead
trace the surrounding filamentary structure; H-band selected galaxies, on the
other hand, are found in the highest mass haloes. This has implications for the
measurement of the rate at which fluctuations grow due to gravitational
instability. We use mock catalogues to compare the effective volumes sampled by
a range of survey configurations. To give just two examples: a redshift survey
down to $H_{\rm AB}=22$ samples an effective volume that is $\sim 5-10$ times
larger than that probed by an \ha survey with $\logfha > -15.4$; a flux limit
of at least $\logfha = -16$ is required for an \ha sample to become competitive

distributions from ~0.2--10Re, where Re is the optical effective radius of the
central galaxy, are remarkably similar to powerlaw density profiles. The
negative logarithmic slope of the mass density profiles, alpha, systematically
varies with Re, from alpha=2, for systems with Re~4kpc to alpha=1.2 for systems
with Re>30kpc. Departures from hydrostatic equilibrium are likely to be small
and cannot easily explain this trend. We show that the conspiracy between the
baryonic (Sersic) and dark matter (NFW/ Einasto) components required to
maintain a powerlaw total mass distribution naturally predicts an
anti-correlation between alpha and Re that is very close to what is observed.
The systematic variation of alpha with Re implies a dark matter fraction within
Re that varies systematically with the properties of the galaxy in such a
manner as to reproduce, without fine tuning, the observed tilt of the
fundamental plane. We speculate that establishing a nearly powerlaw total mass
distribution is therefore a fundamental feature of galaxy formation and the

supernova remnant. The late time energy injection can then be radiated without
suffering overwhelming adiabatic expansion losses. The magnetar input also
produces a central bubble which sweeps ejecta into an internal dense shell,
resulting in a prolonged period of nearly constant photospheric velocity in the
observed spectra. We derive analytic expressions for the light curve rise time
and peak luminosity as a function of B, P and the properties of the supernova
ejecta that allow for direct inferences about the underlying magnetar in bright
supernovae. We perform numerical radiation hydrodynamical calculations of a few
specific instances and compare the resulting light curves to observed events.
Magnetar activity is likely to impact more than a few percent of all core
collapse supernovae, and may naturally explain some of the brightest events
ever seen (e.g., SN 2005ap and SN 2008es) at L > 10^44 ergs/s.

kinematics of the cloud's cometary tail indicates that the gas is in the
process of accretion onto the Galaxy, as first discussed by Lockman et al.

possibility that the cloud is confined by a dark matter halo. This is required
for the cloud to survive its passage through the Galactic corona. We consider
three possible models for the dark matter halo (NFW, Einasto, Burkert)
including the effects of tidal disruption and ram-pressure stripping during the
cloud's infall onto and passage through the Galactic disk. For the NFW and
Einasto dark-matter models, we are able to determine reasonable initial
conditions for the Smith Cloud, although this is only marginally possible with
the Burkert model. For all three models, the progenitor had an initial
(gas+dark matter) mass that was an order of magnitude higher than inferred
today. In agreement with Lockman et al. (2008), the cloud appears to have
punched through the disk ~70 Myr ago. For our most successful models, the
baryon to dark matter ratio is fairly constant during an orbital period but
drops by a factor of 2-5 after transiting the disk. The cloud appears to have
only marginally survived its transit, and is unlikely to retain its integrity

limitation for these experiments is how quickly accurate redshifts can be

strategy is to target emission-line (i.e. star-forming) galaxies at

increasing out to z~2, but also emission-lines provide an efficient method of
redshift determination. Motivated by the prospect of future dark energy surveys
targeting H-alpha emitters at near-infrared wavelengths (i.e. z>0.5), we use
the latest empirical data to model the evolution of the H-alpha luminosity
function out to z~2, and thus provide predictions for the abundance of H-alpha
emitters for practical limiting fluxes. We caution that the estimates presented
in this work must be tempered by an efficiency factor, epsilon, giving the
redshift success rate from these potential targets. For a range of practical
efficiencies and limiting fluxes, we provide an estimate of nP_{0.2}, where n
is the 3D galaxy number density and P_{0.2} is the galaxy power spectrum
evaluated at k=0.2h/Mpc. Ideal surveys must provide nP_{0.2}>1 in order to
balance shot-noise and cosmic variance errors. We show that a realistic
emission-line survey (epsilon=0.5) could achieve nP_{0.2}=1 out to z~1.5 with a
limiting flux of 10^{-16} erg/s/cm^{-2}. If the limiting flux is a factor 5

well-known features that have been seen in other SN Ia samples. Specifically,
hosts with active star formation produce brighter and slower SNe Ia on average,
and hosts with luminosity-weighted ages older than 1 Gyr produce on average
more faint, fast and fewer bright, slow SNe Ia than younger hosts. New results
include that in our sample, the faintest and fastest SNe Ia occur only in
galaxies exceeding a stellar mass threshhold of ~10^10 M_sun, indicating that
their progenitors must arise in populations that are older and/or more metal
rich than the general SN Ia population. A low host extinction sub-sample hints
at a residual trend in peak luminosity with host age, after correcting for
light-curve shape, giving the appearance that older hosts produce
less-extincted SNe Ia on average. This has implications for cosmological
fitting of SNe Ia and suggests that host age could be useful as a parameter in
the fitting. Converting host mass to metallicity and computing 56Ni mass from
the supernova light curves, we find that our local sample is consistent with a
model that predicts a shallow trend between stellar metallicity and the 56Ni
mass that powers the explosion, but we cannot rule out the absence of a trend.
We measure a correlation between 56Ni mass and host age in the local universe
that is shallower and not as significant as that seen at higher redshifts. The
details of the age -- 56Ni mass correlations at low and higher redshift imply a
luminosity-weighted age threshhold of ~3 Gyr for SN Ia hosts, above which they
are less likely to produce SNe Ia with 56Ni masses above ~0.5 M_sun. (Abridged)

simple, comprehensible physical principles from which the theory can be

some features with quantum theory, such as probabilistic predictions for
individual outcomes (indeterminism), the impossibility of information transfer
faster than speed of light (no-signaling) or the impossibility of copying of
unknown states (no-cloning). A vast majority of attempts to find physical
principles behind quantum theory either fall short of deriving the theory
uniquely from the principles or are based on abstract mathematical assumptions
that require themselves a more conclusive physical motivation. Here, we show
that classical probability theory and quantum theory can be reconstructed from
three reasonable axioms: (1) (Information capacity) All systems with
information carrying capacity of one bit are equivalent. (2) (Locality) The
state of a composite system is completely determined by measurements on its
subsystems. (3) (Reversibility) Between any two pure states there exists a
reversible transformation. If one requires the transformation from the last
axiom to be continuous, one separates quantum theory from the classical
probabilistic one. A remarkable result following from our reconstruction is
that no probability theory other than quantum theory can exhibit entanglement
without contradicting one or more axioms.

metallicity distributions, which are frequently interpreted as indicating two
distinct modes of cluster formation. The metal-rich (red) and metal-poor (blue)
clusters have systematically different locations and kinematics in their host
galaxies. However, the red and blue clusters have similar internal properties,
such as the masses, sizes, and ages. It is therefore interesting to explore
whether both metal-rich and metal-poor clusters could form by a common
mechanism and still be consistent with the bimodal distribution. We show that
if all globular clusters form only during mergers of massive gas-rich
protogalactic disks, their metallicity distribution could be statistically
consistent with that of the Galactic globulars. We take galaxy assembly history
from cosmological dark matter simulations and couple it with the observed
scaling relations for the amount of cold gas available for star formation. In
the best-fit model, early mergers of smaller hosts create exclusively blue
clusters, whereas subsequent mergers of progenitor galaxies with a range of
masses create both red and blue clusters. Thus bimodality arises naturally as
the result of a small number of late massive merger events. We calculate the
cluster mass loss, including the effects of two-body scattering and stellar
evolution, and find that more blue clusters than red clusters are disrupted by
the present time, because of their smaller initial masses and larger ages. The
present-day mass function in the best-fit model is consistent with the Galactic
distribution. However, the spatial distribution of model clusters is much more
extended than observed and is independent of the parameters of our model.

Our aim is to show that, by coupling existing high-resolution spectrographs to

from combining an interferometer with a high-resolution spectrograph. The

the dwarf sample is based on the central surface brightness and includes
galaxies in the luminosity range -16 >= M_B >~-19 mag. Using a fit to the color

Furthermore, the redder dwarfs are on average more compact and rounder than the
bluer dwarfs. These findings are consistent with theoretical expectations
assuming that bright early-type dwarfs are the remnants of transformed
late-type disk galaxies involving processes such as ram pressure stripping and
galaxy harassment. This indicates that a considerable fraction of dwarf
elliptical galaxies in clusters are the results of transformation processes
related to interactions with their host cluster.

applied to these problems the self-consistent Gutzwiller technique recently

ubiquitous presence of exponential decays and crossovers, with decay lengths of

most representations of this data result in correlations with large scatter, we
find a remarkably tight relation among colors formed by ratios of luminosities
in Spitzer-MIPS (24, 70 and 160 um) bands and the Ks-band. Remarkably, this
correlation among E and S0 galaxies follows that of nearby normal galaxies of
all morphological types. In particular, the tight infrared color-color
correlation for S0 galaxies alone follows that of the entire Hubble sequence of
normal galaxies, roughly in order of galaxy type from ellipticals to spirals to
irregulars. The specific star formation rate of S0 galaxies estimated from the
24um luminosity increases with decreasing Ks-band luminosity (or stellar mass)
from essentially zero, as with most massive ellipticals, to rates typical of
irregular galaxies. Moreover, the luminosities of the many infrared-luminous S0
galaxies can significantly exceed those of the most luminous (presumably
post-merger) E galaxies. Star formation rates in the most infrared-luminous S0
galaxies approach 1-10 solar masses per year. Consistently with this picture we
find that while most early-type galaxies populate an infrared red sequence,
about 24% of the objects (mostly S0s) are in an infrared blue cloud together
with late type galaxies. For those early-type galaxies also observed at radio
frequencies we find that the far-infrared luminosities correlate with the mass
of neutral and molecular hydrogen, but the scatter is large. This scatter
suggests that the star formation may be intermittent or that similar S0
galaxies with cold gaseous disks of nearly equal mass can have varying radial
column density distributions that alter the local and global SF rates.

into a count rate (frequency). The count rates are integrated over 0.25 sec
increments and transmitted to the EVE Science and Operations Center for data
processing. An algorithm for converting the measured count rates into solar
irradiance and the ESP calibration parameters are described. The ESP pre-flight
calibration was performed at the Synchrotron Ultraviolet Radiation Facility of
the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Calibration parameters were
used to calculate absolute solar irradiance from the Sounding Rocket flight

match the irradiance determined for two other EUV channels flown
simultaneously, EVE's Multiple Euv Grating Spectrograph (MEGS) and SOHO's

the fate of total destruction by direct collision with Mars. On the other hand
Deimos, the second moon of Mars is in extra-synchronous orbit and almost stay
put in the present orbit. The reported altitude loss of Phobos is two meter per
century by wikipedia and sixty ft per century according to ozgate url . The
reported time in which the destruction will take place is fiftyMy and fortyMy
respectively. The authors had proposed a planetary-satellite dynamics based on
detailed study of Earth-Moon. Based on this planetary satellite dynamics, two
meter/century approach velocity leads to the age of Phobos to be twenty three
Gyrs which is physically untenable since our Solar System age is four and a
half Gyrs. Hence the present altitude loss is assumed to be twenty meter per
century. This leads to the age of Phobos to be two decimal three Gyrs and age
of Deimos to be two decimal two six Gyrs which is an acceptable result and from
this analysis it is predicted that the travel time from the present orbital
radius of nine thousand three hundred and eighty km to the Martian surface at
three thousand, three hundred and ninety seven km is ten decimal and four Myrs.
Hence doomsday of Phobos is at ten decimal and fourMyrs from now. Mars Express

disequilibrium stratospheric chemistries of warm and hot Jupiters (800 < T <

than photochemistry. At 1200 K, methane is oxidized to CO and CO2 by OH
radicals from thermal decomposition of water. At T < 1000 K, methane is
reactive but stable enough to reach the stratosphere, while water is stable
enough that OH levels are suppressed by reaction with H2. These trends raise
the effective C/O ratio in the reacting gases above unity. Reduced products
such as ethylene, acetylene, and hydrogen cyanide become abundant; further
polymerization should lead to formation of PAHs (Poly-Aromatic Hydrocarbons)
and soots. Parallel shifts are seen in the sulfur chemistry, with CS and CS2
displacing S2 and HS as the interesting disequilibrium products. Although lower
temperature is a leading factor favoring hydrocarbons, higher rates of vertical
mixing, lower metallicities, and lower incident UV radiation also favor organic
synthesis. Acetylene (the first step toward PAHs) formation is especially
favored by high eddy diffusion coefficients Kzz > 10^10 cm2/s. In most cases
planetary compositions inferred from transit observations will differ markedly
from those inferred from reflected or emitted light from the same planet. The
peculiar properties of HD 189733b compared to other hot Jupiters - a broadband
blue haze, little sign of Na or K, and hints of low metallicity - can be
explained by an organic haze if the planet is cool enough. Whether this

massive (0.1<Mstellar<5e11Mo) galaxies at 2<z<6, selected from future large
area optical-near IR surveys. We produced a set of about one thousand numerical
simulations of 3D observations using reasonable assumptions about the site,
telescope, and instrument, and about the physics of distant galaxies. These
data-cubes were analysed as real data to produce realistic kinematic
measurements of very distant galaxies. We then studied how sensible the
scientific goals are to the observational (i.e., site-, telescope-, and
instrument-related) and physical (i.e., galaxy-related) parameters. We
specifically investigated the impact of AO performance on the science goal. We
did not identify any breaking points with respect to the parameters (e.g., the
telescope diameter), with the exception of the telescope thermal background,
which strongly limits the performance in the highest (z>5) redshift bin. We
find that a survey of Ngal galaxies that fulfil the range of science goals can

corroborated through this study of exoplanets. All planets are born at inner
Clarke Orbit what we refer to as inner geo-synchronous orbit in case of

radiation pressure, the planet gets tipped long of aG1 or short of aG1. Here
aG1 is inner Clarke Orbit. The exoplanet can either be launched on death spiral

planets in our Solar System are. It was also found that if the exo-planet are
significant fraction of the host star then those exo-planets rapidly migrate
from aG1 to aG2 and have very short Time Constant of Evolution as Brown Dwarfs
have. This vindicates our basic premise that planets are always born at inner

another relatively unexplored, though often alluded to, advantage of using

modern physics is to understand the behavior of an ensemble of strongly
interacting particles. A class of quantum many-body systems such as neutron
matter and cold Fermi gases share the same universal thermodynamic properties
when interactions reach the maximum effective value allowed by quantum
mechanics, the so-called unitary limit [1,2]. It is then possible to simulate
some astrophysical phenomena inside the highly controlled environment of an
atomic physics laboratory. Previous work on the thermodynamics of a
two-component Fermi gas led to thermodynamic quantities averaged over the trap
[3-5], making it difficult to compare with many-body theories developed for
uniform gases. Here we develop a general method that provides for the first
time the equation of state of a uniform gas, as well as a detailed comparison
with existing theories [6,14]. The precision of our equation of state leads to
new physical insights on the unitary gas. For the unpolarized gas, we prove
that the low-temperature thermodynamics of the strongly interacting normal
phase is well described by Fermi liquid theory and we localize the superfluid
transition. For a spin-polarized system, our equation of state at zero
temperature has a 2% accuracy and it extends the work of [15] on the phase
diagram to a new regime of precision. We show in particular that, despite
strong correlations, the normal phase behaves as a mixture of two ideal gases:
a Fermi gas of bare majority atoms and a non-interacting gas of dressed
quasi-particles, the fermionic polarons [10,16-18].

observed experimentally in a narrow water flow channel. A particle tracking
method reveals that the migration speed of the model dune is one order of
magnitude smaller than that of individual grains. In particular, the erosion
rate consists of comparable contributions from creeping (low energy) and
saltating (high energy) particles. The saltation flow rate is slightly larger,
whereas the number of saltating particles is one order of magnitude lower than
that of the creeping ones. The velocity field of the saltating particles is
comparable to the velocity field of the driving fluid. It can be observed that
the spatial profile of the shear stress reaches its maximum value upstream of
the crest, while its minimum lies at the downstream foot of the dune. The
particle tracking method reveals that the deposition of entrained particles
occurs primarily in the region between these two extrema of the shear stress.
Moreover, it is demonstrated that the initial triangular heap evolves to a
steady state with constant mass, shape, velocity, and packing fraction after
one turnover time has elapsed. Within that time the mean distance between
particles initially in contact reaches a value of approximately one quarter of
the dune basis length.

D-invertibility, under suitable conditions. While left invertibility takes into
account membership in sets of a given partition, left D-invertibility considers
only distances, and is very easy to detect. Considering the system $x^+=ax+u$,
our main result states that left invertibility and left D-invertibility are
equivalent, for all but a (computable) set of $a$'s, discrete except for the
possible presence of two accumulation point. In other words, from a practical

some number theoretic techniques that have revealed a mathematical problem

excites Rydberg states while the second half returns atoms to the ground state,
as in the experiment of Raitzsch et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 100 (2008) 013002].
Near to the end of the echo sequence, almost any remaining Rydberg atom is
separated from its next-neighbor Rydberg atom by a distance slightly larger
than the instantaneous blockade radius half-way through the pulse. These
correlations lead to large deviations of the atom counting statistics from a

first time a non force-free field composed of a mixture of poloidal and
toroidal magnetic fields and we propose a specific configuration to illustrate
our purpose. In the present paper, we estimate the relative role of the
different terms which appear in the modified stellar structure equations. We
note that the Lorentz tension plays a non negligible role in addition to the
magnetic pressure. This is interesting because most of the previous stellar
evolution codes ignored that term and the geometry of the field. The solar
structure perturbations are, as already known, small and consequently we have
been able to estimate each term semi-analytically. We develop a general
treatment to calculate the global modification of the structure and of the
energetic balance. We estimate also the gravitational multipolar moments
associated with the presence of a fossil large-scale magnetic field in
radiative zone. The values given for the young Sun help the future
implementation in stellar evolution codes. This work can be repeated for any
other field configuration and prepares the achievement of a solar MHD model
where we will follow the transport of such field on secular timescales and the
associated transport of momentum and chemicals. The described method will be
applied at the present Sun and the results will be compared with the coming

photometric properties predicted by these models do not readily match the

expected variation in the number of stars occupying sparsely populated
evolutionary stages, due to stochastic fluctuations in the stellar initial mass
function. In this case, population synthesis models reproduce remarkably well
the full ranges of observed integrated colours and absolute magnitudes of star
clusters of various ages and metallicities. The disagreement between the model
predictions and observations of cluster colours and magnitudes may indicate
problems with or deficiencies in the modelling, and dioes not necessarily tell
us that star clusters do not behave like SSPs. Matching the photometric
properties of star clusters using SSP models is a necessary (but not

star clusters is given, with main emphasis on high-mass clusters. Clusters form
deeply embedded within dense clouds of molecular gas. Left-over gas is cleared
within a few million years and, depending on the efficiency of star formation,
the clusters may disperse almost immediately or remain gravitationally bound.
Current evidence suggests that a few percent of star formation occurs in
clusters that remain bound, although it is not yet clear if this fraction is
truly universal. Internal two-body relaxation and external shocks will lead to
further, gradual dissolution on timescales of up to a few hundred million years
for low-mass open clusters in the Milky Way, while the most massive clusters (>
10^5 Msun) have lifetimes comparable to or exceeding the age of the Universe.
The low-mass end of the initial cluster mass function is well approximated by a
power-law distribution, dN/dM ~ M^{-2}, but there is mounting evidence that
quiescent spiral discs form relatively few clusters with masses M > 2 x 10^5
Msun. In starburst galaxies and old globular cluster systems, this limit
appears to be higher, at least several x 10^6 Msun. The difference is likely
related to the higher gas densities and pressures in starburst galaxies, which
allow denser, more massive giant molecular clouds to form. Low-mass clusters
may thus trace star formation quite universally, while the more long-lived,
massive clusters appear to form preferentially in the context of violent star
formation.

for low- and intermediate-mass stars. AGB star outflows inject a significant
amount of material into the interstellar medium (ISM), seeding new star
formation. AGB mass loss is thus a crucial component of galactic chemical
evolution. The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is an excellent site for AGB
studies. Over 40,000 AGB candidates have been identified using photometric data
from the Spitzer Space Telescope Surveying The Agents of a Galaxy's Evolution
(SAGE) mid-infrared (MIR) survey, including about 35,000 oxygen-rich, 7000
carbon-rich and 1400 ""extreme"" sources. For the first time, SAGE photometry
reveals two distinct populations of O-rich sources in the LMC: a faint
population that gradually evolves into C-rich stars and a bright, massive
population that circumvents this evolution, remaining O-rich. This work aims to
quantify the mass-loss return from AGB stars to the LMC, a rough estimate for
which is derived from the amount of MIR dust emission in excess of that from
starlight. I show that this excess flux is a good proxy for the mass-loss rate,
and I calculate the total AGB injection rate to be (5.9-13) x 10{-3} Msun/yr. A
more accurate determination requires detailed dust radiative transfer (RT)
modeling. For this purpose, I present a grid of C-rich AGB models generated by

shell radii and optical depths as well as a baseline set of dust properties

is understanding how the graph or hypergraph describing the incidence structure
of the constraints influences the complexity of the problem. For binary CSP
instances (i.e., where each constraint involves only two variables), the
situation is well understood: the complexity of the problem essentially depends
on the treewidth of the graph of the constraints. However, this is not the
correct answer if constraints with unbounded number of variables are allowed,
and in particular, for CSP instances arising from query evaluation problems in
database theory. Formally, if H is a class of hypergraphs, then let CSP(H) be
CSP restricted to instances whose hypergraph is in H. Our goal is to
characterize those classes of hypergraphs for which CSP(H) is polynomial-time
solvable or fixed-parameter tractable, parameterized by the number of
variables. Note that in the applications related to database query evaluation,
we usually assume that the number of variables is much smaller than the size of
the instance, thus parameterization by the number of variables is a meaningful
question. The most general known property of H that makes CSP(H)
polynomial-time solvable is bounded fractional hypertree width. Here we
introduce a new hypergraph measure called submodular width, and show that
bounded submodular width of H implies that CSP(H) is fixed-parameter tractable.
In a matching hardness result, we show that if H has unbounded submodular
width, then CSP(H) is not fixed-parameter tractable, unless the Exponential
Time Hypothesis fails.

solely Fermionic occupation numbers of two species corresponding to particles
with $\up$ and $\down$ spin, respectively. In this paper, we employ the
transfer matrix method to analytically solve the CIHM at finite temperature in

at large and small Coulomb interaction strength, $U$, mediated with a gap-less
metallic phase, resulting in two continuous metal-insulator transitions. Our
results are further supported with Monte Carlo simulations.

drives the final architecture of the planets assembly. In order for a habitable

surface brightness, SNR diameter, and ambient medium density. We investigate
these correlations, to extract useful information about the typical
evolutionary stage of radio SNRs, and to obtain insight into the origin of the
relativistic electrons and magnetic fields responsible for the radio emission.
We propose a scenario, according to which the observed correlations are the
combined effect of SNRs evolving in a wide range of ambient conditions, rather
than the evolutionary track of a ""typical"" SNR. We then develop a parametric
approach to interpret the statistical data, and apply it to the data sample
previously published by Berkhuijsen, as well as to a sample of SNRs in the
galaxy M33. We find that SNRs cease to emit effectively in radio at a stage
near the end of their Sedov evolution, and that models of synchrotron emission
with constant efficiencies in particle acceleration and magnetic field
amplification do not provide a close match to the data. We discuss the problem
of the cumulative distribution in size, showing that the slope of this
distribution does not relate to the expansion law of SNRs, as usually assumed,
but only to the ambient density distribution. This solves a long-standing
paradox: the almost linear cumulative distribution of SNRs led several authors
to conclude that these SNRs are still in free expansion, which also implies
very low ambient densities. Within this framework, we discuss the case of the
starburst galaxy M82. Statistical properties of SNR samples may be used to shed
light on both the physics of electron acceleration and the evolution of SNRs.
More precise results could be obtained by combining data of several surveys of
SNRs in nearby galaxies.

arterial blood pressure signal is reconstructed using a semi-classical signal
analysis method allowing the computation of a parameter, called the first
systolic invariant INVS1. We show that INVS1 is linearly related to stroke
volume. To validate this approach, a statistical comparaison between INVS1 and
stroke volume measured with the PiCCO technique was performed during a 15-mn
recording in 21 mechanically ventilated patients in intensive care. In 94% of
the whole recordings, a strong correlation was estimated by cross-correlation
analysis (mean coefficient=0.9) and linear regression (mean coefficient=0.89).
Once the linear relation had been verified, a Bland-Altman test showed the very
good agreement between the two approaches and their interchangeability. For the
remaining 6%, INVS1 and the PiCCO stroke volume were not correlated at all, and
this discrepancy, interpreted with the help of mean pressure, heart rate and
peripheral vascular resistances, was in favor of INVS1.

regard to the application: medical treatment or recovering after an effort in

numerical 2D model was set up for computing stress fields inside the leg,
accounting for the actual material properties of both the compression stocking

the centerline streamwise variation of most of the statistical properties of

also confirm the finding of Seoud and Vassilicos (Physics of Fluids, 2007) that
the ratio of the integral length-scale $L_u$ to the Taylor micro-scale
$\lambda$ remains constant in the decaying region whereas the Reynolds number
$Re_\lambda$ strongly decreases. As a result the scaling $L_{u}/\lambda \sim
Re_{\lambda}$ which follows from the $u'^{3}/L_u$ scaling of the dissipation
rate in boundary-free shear flows and in usual grid-generated turbulence does
not hold here. However, we show that the ratio $L_u/\lambda$ is an increasing
function of the inlet Reynolds number $Re_0$. This extraordinary decoupling is
consistent with a self-preserving single length-scale decaying homogeneous

computational abilities of quantum systems and the Church-Turing Thesis role in
Physics. We propose here the idea of geometry of effective physical process as
the essentially physical notion of computation. In Quantum mechanics we cannot
use the traditional Euclidean geometry but we introduce more sophisticate non
Euclidean geometry which include a new kind of information diffuse in the
entire universe and that we can represent as Fisher information or active
information. We remark that from the Fisher information we can obtain the Bohm
and Hiley quantum potential and the classical Schrodinger equation. We can see
the quantum phenomena do not affect a limited region of the space but is
reflected in a change of the geometry of all the universe. In conclusion any
local physical change or physical process is reflected in all the universe by
the change of its geometry, This is the deepest meaning of the entanglement in
Quantum mechanics and quantum computing. We stress the connection between
metric and information as measure of change. Because computation is not
restricted to calculus but is the environment changing via physical processes,
super-Turing potentialities derive from an incomputable information source
embedded into the geometry of the universe in accordance with Bell's
constraints. In the general relativity we define the geometry of the space
time. In our approach quantum phenomena define the geometry of the parameters
of the probability distribution that include also the space time parameters. To
study this new approach to the computation we use the new theory of Morphogenic
systems.

a core-jet structure. Three Seyfert nuclei are surrounded by diffuse radio
emission related to star-forming regions. VLBA observations with parsec-scale
resolution pointed out that in MRK 1239 the nucleus is clearly resolved into
two components separated by ~30 pc, while the nucleus of NGC 3783 is
unresolved. Further comparison between VLA and VLBA data of these two sources
shows that the flux density at parsec scales is only 20% of that measured by
the VLA. This suggests that the radio emission is not concentrated in a single
central component, as in elliptical radio galaxies, and an additional
low-surface brightness component must be present. A comparison of Seyfert
nuclei with different radio spectra points out that the ``presence'' of
undetected flux on milli-arcsecond scale is common in steep-spectrum objects,
while in flat-spectrum objects essentially all the radio emission is recovered.
In the steep-spectrum objects, the nature of this ``missing'' flux is likely
due to non-thermal AGN-related radiation, perhaps from a jet that gets
disrupted in Seyfert galaxies because of the denser environment of their spiral
hosts.

  Sustainable Energy",,,,"physics.gen-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Near-field energy coupling between two surfaces may arise from frustrated
total-internal-reflectance and from atomic dipole-dipole interaction. Such an
exchange of energy, if at resonance, greatly enhances the radiation transfer
between an emitter and a photovoltaic converter. Computational modeling of
selected, but realizable, emitter and detector structures and materials shows
the benefits of both near-field and resonance coupling (e.g., with ~ 100nm
gaps). In one sense, this is almost an engineering paper. A strong
computational model (based on physically-proven concepts and incorporating
known and predicted high-temperature properties of acceptable emitter
materials) is used to demonstrate the potential of materials (properly-selected
to overcome natural limitations) and of structures (carefully crafted to push
the limits of present technology) for breaking barriers of thermal conversion
at lower-emitter temperatures (< 1000C).

used as a switch to turn on or off the topological insulator phase, and
temperature can affect significantly the phase diagram for different gate

to manipulate the quantum phase of HgTe quantum wells.

Eu2+, we investigated a Ca-substituted sample, Eu0.5Ca0.5Fe2As2, under high
pressure. For ambient pressure, the sample exhibits a spin-density-wave (SDW)
transition at TSDW = 191 K and antiferromagnetic order at TN = 4 K, but no
evidence of superconductivity down to 2 K. The Ca-substitution certainly
weakens the antiferromagnetism. With increasing pressure, TSDW shifts to lower
temperature and becomes more unclear. Above 1.27 GPa, pressure-induced
superconductivity with zero resistivity is observed at around Tc = 20 K. At
2.14 GPa, Tc reaches a maximum value of 24 K and the superconducting transition
becomes the sharpest. These features of emergence of the superconductivity are
qualitatively similar to those observed in AFe2As2 (A = Ba, Ca).
