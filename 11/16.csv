OGLE-2006-BLG-109Lb,c, which was the first double planet system discovered with
the gravitational microlensing method. This is the only multi-planet system
discovered by any method with measured masses for the star and both planets. In
addition to the signatures of two planets, this event also exhibits a
microlensing parallax signature and finite source effects that provide a direct
measure of the masses of the star and planets, and the expected brightness of
the host star is confirmed by Keck AO imaging, yielding masses of M_* =
0.51(+0.05-0.04) M_sun, M_b = 231+-19 M_earth, M_c = 86+-7 M_earth. The
Saturn-analog planet in this system had a planetary light curve deviation that
lasted for 11 days, and as a result, the effects of the orbital motion are
visible in the microlensing light curve. We find that four of the six orbital
parameters are tightly constrained and that a fifth parameter, the orbital
acceleration, is weakly constrained. No orbital information is available for
the Jupiter-analog planet, but its presence helps to constrain the orbital
motion of the Saturn-analog planet. Assuming co-planar orbits, we find an
orbital eccentricity of eccentricity = 0.15 (+0.17-0.10) and an orbital
inclination of i = 64 (+4-7) deg. The 95% confidence level lower limit on the
inclination of i > 49 deg. implies that this planetary system can be detected
and studied via radial velocity measurements using a telescope of >30m
aperture.

becomes then necessary to estimate the hyper-parameters characterizing the

since in general the frame synthesis operator is not bijective. Consequently,
the frame coefficients are not directly observable. This paper introduces a
hierarchical Bayesian model for frame representation. The posterior
distribution of the frame coefficients and model hyper-parameters is derived.
Hybrid Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms are subsequently proposed to sample
from this posterior distribution. The generated samples are then exploited to
estimate the hyper-parameters and the frame coefficients of the target signal.
Validation experiments show that the proposed algorithms provide an accurate

rule is likely to support spaceships, small patterns that move and that form
the building blocks of many of the more complex patterns that are known for

phenomena of interest supported by the given cellular automaton rule, but we
will have to look harder for them. Although our classification is very crude,
we argue that it is more objective than Wolfram's (due to the greater ease of
determining a rigorous answer to these questions), more predictive (as we can
classify large groups of rules without observing them individually), and more
accurate in focusing attention on rules likely to support patterns with complex
behavior. We support these assertions by surveying a number of known cellular

(LHT-I, LHT-II). Compared with the Standard Model (SM) prediction, the
production rate is found to be sizably altered in these little Higgs models
and, more interestingly, different models give different predictions. We find
that the production rate can be possibly enhanced only in the LHT-II for some
part of the parameter space, while in all other cases the rate is suppressed.
The suppression can be 10% in the LH and as much as 60% in both the SLH and the
LHT-I/LHT-II. The severe suppression in the SLH happens for a large \tan\beta
and a small m_h, in which the new decay mode h->\eta\eta (\eta is a light
pseudo-scalar) is dominant; while for the LHT-I/LHT-II the large suppression
occurs when f and m_h are both small so that the new decay mode h->A_H A_H is
dominant. Therefore, the precision measurement of such a production process at
the ILC will allow for a test of these models and even distinguish between
different scenarios.

involving a gauge field whose kinetic term is modified by the exponential of a
neutral scalar. This black hole has two properties which one might reasonably
demand of the dual of a Fermi liquid: Its entropy is proportional to
temperature at low temperature, and its extremal limit supports normal modes of
massless, charged bulk fermions. The black hole we study has a simple analytic
form because it can be embedded in type IIB string theory as the near-horizon
limit of D3-branes with equal spins in two of the three independent transverse
planes. Two further properties can be deduced from this embedding: There is a
thermodynamic instability, reminiscent of ferromagnetism, at low temperatures;
and there is an AdS_3 factor in the extremal near-horizon geometry which
accounts for the linear dependence of entropy on temperature. Altogether, it is
plausible that the dilatonic black hole we study, or a relative of it with
similar behavior in the infrared, is the dual of a Fermi liquid; however, the
particular embedding in string theory that we consider is unlikely to have such
a dual description, unless through some unexpected boson-fermion equivalence at
large N.

observed and potentially noisy data. The proposed approach consists of two main
elements: (1) {\em filtering}, or assigning a belief or likelihood to each
successive measurement based upon our ability to predict it from previous noisy
observations, and (2) {\em hedging}, or flagging potential anomalies by
comparing the current belief against a time-varying and data-adaptive
threshold. The threshold is adjusted based on the available feedback from an
end user. Our algorithms, which combine universal prediction with recent work
on online convex programming, do not require computing posterior distributions
given all current observations and involve simple primal-dual parameter
updates. At the heart of the proposed approach lie exponential-family models
which can be used in a wide variety of contexts and applications, and which
yield methods that achieve sublinear per-round regret against both static and
slowly varying product distributions with marginals drawn from the same
exponential family. Moreover, the regret against static distributions coincides
with the minimax value of the corresponding online strongly convex game. We
also prove bounds on the number of mistakes made during the hedging step
relative to the best offline choice of the threshold with access to all
estimated beliefs and feedback signals. We validate the theory on synthetic
data drawn from a time-varying distribution over binary vectors of high
dimensionality, as well as on the Enron email dataset.

equations by Chew, Goldberger, and Low, 1956) by including two anisotropic heat
flux evolution equations, where the fluxes invalidate the double polytropic CGL
laws. We derived the general dispersion relation for linear compressible wave
modes. Besides the classic incompressible fire hose modes there appear four
types of compressible wave modes: two fast and slow mirror modes - strongly
modified compared to the CGL model - and two thermal modes. In the presence of
initial heat fluxes along the magnetic field the wave properties become
different for the waves running forward and backward with respect to the
magnetic field. The well known discrepancies between the results of the CGL-MHD
fluid model and the kinetic theory are now removed: i) The mirror slow mode
instability criterion is now the same as that in the kinetic theory. ii)
Similarly, in kinetic studies there appear two kinds of fire hose instabilities
- incompressible and compressible ones. These two instabilities can arise for
the same plasma parameters, and the instability of the new compressible oblique
fire hose modes can become dominant. The compressible fire hose instability is
the result of the resonance coupling of three retrograde modes - two thermal
modes and a fast mirror mode. The results can be applied to the theory of solar

that in many cases the parameters of the BEC correspond to the semiclassical

strong asymptotics of the semiclassical limit solutions can be used to describe
some interesting phenomena of the attractive 1D BEC. In general, the
semiclassical limit of the focusing NLS exibits very strong modulation
instability. However, in the case of an analytical initial data, the NLS
evolution does displays some ordered structure, that can describe, for example,
the bright soliton phenomenon. We discuss some general features of the

present high-resolution K-band and M-band spectra from the W. M. Keck

to spectra acquired during the previous outburst and quiescent phases. We find
that the luminosity and full width at half maximum power of Br-gamma increased
as the star has brightened and decreased when the star faded indicating that
these phases are driven by variations in the accretion rate. We also show that
the temperature of the CO emission has varied with the stellar accretion rate

attack when the number of known original tuples is less than the number of data
dimensions. We focus on this important case, develop and rigorously analyze an
attack that utilizes any number of known original tuples. The approach allows
the attacker to estimate the original data tuple associated with each perturbed
tuple and calculate the probability that the estimation results in a privacy
breach. On a real 16-dimensional dataset, we show that the attacker, with 4
known original tuples, can estimate an original unknown tuple with less than 7%
error with probability exceeding 0.8.

the downlink. In one scheme the node nearest to the destination that has
decoded information from the base station in the first hop is used as the

received information in the first hop acts as a relay. In both these schemes we
obtain the success probability of the two hop scheme, accounting for the
interference from all other cells. We use tools from stochastic geometry and
point process theory to analyze the two hop schemes. Besides the results

variation of the polarization vector is apparently erratic in most blazars,
while several objects occasionally exhibited systematic variations, for
example, an increase of the polarization degree associated with a flare of the
total flux. We assume that the observed polarization vector is a superposition
of distinct two components, a long-term trend and a short-term variation
component responsible for short flares. Our Bayesian model estimates the
long-term trend which satisfies the condition that the total flux correlates
with the polarized flux of the short-term component. We demonstrate that
assumed long-term polarization components are successfully separated by the
Bayesian model for artificial data. We applied this method to photopolarimetric
data of OJ 287, S5 0716+714, and S2 0109+224. Simple and systematic long-term
trends were obtained in OJ 287 and S2 0109+224, while no such a trend was
identified in S5 0716+714. We propose that the apparently erratic variations of
polarization in OJ 287 and S2 0109+224 are due to the presence of the long-term

spectrum sharing between primary users (PUs) and secondary users (SUs) in a
cognitive radio network. Specifically, a multi-antenna SU transmitter applies
CB to suppress the interference to the PU receivers as well as enhance the
corresponding SU-link performance. In this paper, for a
multiple-input-single-output (MISO) SU channel coexisting with a
single-input-single-output (SISO) PU channel, we propose a new and practical
paradigm for designing CB based on the finite-rate cooperative feedback from
the PU receiver to the SU transmitter. Specifically, the PU receiver
communicates to the SU transmitter the quantized SU-to-PU channel direction
information (CDI) for computing the SU transmit beamformer, and the
interference power control (IPC) signal that regulates the SU transmission
power according to the tolerable interference margin at the PU receiver. Two CB
algorithms based on cooperative feedback are proposed: one restricts the SU
transmit beamformer to be orthogonal to the quantized SU-to-PU channel
direction and the other relaxes such a constraint. In addition, cooperative
feedforward of the SU CDI from the SU transmitter to the PU receiver is
exploited to allow more efficient cooperative feedback. The outage
probabilities of the SU link for different CB and cooperative
feedback/feedforward algorithms are analyzed, from which the optimal
bit-allocation tradeoff between the CDI and IPC feedback is characterized.

bounded by arrays of either long grooves, or isolated solid pillars on an

achieved experimentally. We present an analytical method to calculate the

as the problem of modelling the quantum phenomenon described by a coherent
superposition of microscopically distinct substates (CSMDS) as a compound one
consisting of alternative subprocesses creating unremovable contexts for each
other, or as that of reducing a non-Kolmogorovian quantum probability space to
underlie a CSMDS to the sum of Kolmogorovian ones. We develop such models for a
1D completed scattering and double slit diffraction. The quantum-classical
problem disappears when, in quantum theory with its integral superposition
principle, CSMDSs obey the ""either-or"" rule to guide alternative random events.
There is no observable which could be associated with the whole ensemble of
statistical data described by a CSMDS, because such data are incompatible -- in
the case of a CSMDS, any observable splits into noncommuting observables
associated with the substates. To calculate the average value of any observable
as well as to introduce characteristic times is meaningful only for the
substates of a CSMDS. Ignoring this feature in the conventional description of
CSMDSs just leads to paradoxical results (e.g., to the Hartman effect and
passing a particle through two slits in the screen simultaneously).

the sensitivity of LHC data to deviations from Standard Model predictions. The
method stores perturbative coefficients of NLO QCD calculations of final-state

  The main novelties in comparison to original work on the subject are the use
of higher-order interpolation, which substantially improves the trade-off
between accuracy and memory use, and a CPU and computer memory optimised way to
construct and store the look-up table using modern software tools.
  It is demonstrated that a sufficient accuracy on the cross-section

the examples of jet production and electro-weak boson (Z, W) production in
proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 14 TeV at the LHC.

the M_bh - M_host relation along 85 per cent of the Universe age. We show that,

dozens of examined structures, an orthorhombic distorted $2\times 2$ structure,
in which the displacement pattern of $X$ halogens resembles the model
conjectured previously based on the empirical information is identified as the
most stable one. The displacements of $X$ halogens, together with those of Cu
ions, result in the formation of $X$-Cu-$X$-Cu-$X$ zigzag chains in the two
materials. The nearest-neighbor interaction within the zigzag chains are
determined to be antiferromagnetic (AFM) for (CuCl)LaNb$_2$O$_7$ but
ferromagnetic (FM) for (CuBr)LaNb$_2$O$_7$. On the other hand, the first two
neighboring interactions between the Cu cations from adjacent chains are found

in-plane exchange couplings in (CuBr)LaNb$_2$O$_7$ are evaluated to be about

notions, including, for example, operational semantics, typing, and acceptance
by non-deterministic machines. We therefore propose a (restricted) logical
theory over relations as a language for specifying such notions. Our
specification logic is further characterized by an ability to explicitly treat
binding in object languages. Once such a logic is fixed, a natural next
question is how we might prove theorems about specifications written in it. We
propose to use a second logic, called a reasoning logic, for this purpose. A
satisfactory reasoning logic should be able to completely encode the
specification logic. Associated with the specification logic are various
notions of binding: for quantifiers within formulas, for eigenvariables within
sequents, and for abstractions within terms. To provide a natural treatment of
these aspects, the reasoning logic must encode binding structures as well as
their associated notions of scope, free and bound variables, and
capture-avoiding substitution. Further, to support arguments about provability,
the reasoning logic should possess strong mechanisms for constructing proofs by
induction and co-induction. We provide these capabilities here by using a logic
called G which represents relations over lambda-terms via definitions of atomic
judgments, contains inference rules for induction and co-induction, and
includes a special generic quantifier. We show how provability in the
specification logic can be transparently encoded in G. We also describe an
interactive theorem prover called Abella that implements G and this two-level
logic approach and we present several examples that demonstrate the efficacy of
Abella in reasoning about computations.

of this approach is that it allows us to run a parameter study in order to
investigate how the accretion disk conditions govern the outflow formation. Our
simulations using the PLUTO code run for 500 inner disk rotations and on a
physical grid size of 100x200 inner disk radii. In general, we obtain
collimated beams of mildly relativistic speed and mass-weighted half-opening
angles of 3-7 degrees. When we increase the outflow Poynting flux by injecting
an additional disk toroidal field into the inlet, Lorentz factors up to 6 are
reached. These flows gain super-magnetosonic speed and remain Poynting flux
dominated. The light surface of the outflow magnetosphere tends to align
vertically - implying three relativistically distinct regimes in the flow - an
inner sub-relativistic domain close to the jet axis, a (rather narrow)
relativistic jet and a surrounding subrelativistic outflow launched from the
outer disk surface - similar to the spine-sheath structure currently discussed
for asymptotic jet propagation and stability. The outer subrelativistic disk
wind is a promising candidate for the X-ray absorption winds that are observed

parameter in already known ones. This simple construction reveals some
surprises: for appropriate values of the staggering, highly non-trivial
continuum limits can be obtained. The simplest case of staggering with period
two (the $Z_2$ case) for the six-vertex model was shown to be related, in one
regime of the spectral parameter, to the critical antiferromagnetic Potts model
on the square lattice, and has a non-compact continuum limit. Here, we study
the other regime: in the very anisotropic limit, it can be viewed as a zig-zag
spin chain with spin anisotropy, or as an anyonic chain with a generic
(non-integer) number of species. From the Bethe-Ansatz solution, we obtain the
central charge $c=2$, the conformal spectrum, and the continuum partition
function, corresponding to one free boson and two Majorana fermions. Finally,
we obtain a massive integrable deformation of the model on the lattice.
Interestingly, its scattering theory is a massive version of the one for the
flow between minimal models. The corresponding field theory is argued to be a
complex version of the $C_2^{(2)}$ Toda theory.

transfer in a four-mode system and the generating function of Pythagorean
triples from number theory. We show that complete population transfer will
occur if ratios between coupling coefficients exactly match one of the
Pythagorean triples (a; b; c) in Z, c^{2} = a^{2} + b^{2}. For a four-level
ladder system this relation takes a simple form (V12; V23; V34) ~ (c; b; a),
where coefficients Vij describe the coupling between modes. We find that the
structure of the evolution operator and the period of complete population
transfer are determined by two distinct frequencies. A combination of these
frequencies provides a generalization of the two-mode Rabi frequency for a
four-mode system.

when a (type I) seesaw model is implemented by suitable flavour symmetries. We
are particularly interested in mass-independent mixing patterns to which the
widely studied tribimaximal mixing pattern belongs. In this class of flavour
models, the running contribution from neutrino Yukawa coupling, which is
generally dominant at energies above the seesaw threshold, can be absorbed by a
small shift on neutrino mass eigenvalues leaving mixing angles unchanged.
Consequently, in the whole running energy range, the change in mixing angles is
due to the contribution coming from charged lepton sector. Subsequently, we
analyze in detail these effects in an explicit flavour model for tribimaximal
neutrino mixing based on an A4 discrete symmetry group. We find that for
normally ordered light neutrinos, the tribimaximal prediction is essentially
stable under renormalization group evolution. On the other hand, in the case of
inverted hierarchy, the deviation of the solar angle from its TB value can be
large depending on mass degeneracy.

kB) which can have different values for the same material in different

observational evidences and deeper theoretical insights reveal that accretion

coupled dynamics, incorporating explicitly the vertical flux. Inter-connecting
dynamics of outflow and accretion essentially upholds the conservation laws. We
investigate the properties of the disk-outflow surface and its strong
dependence on the rotation parameter of the black hole. The energetics of the
disk-outflow strongly depend on the mass, accretion rate and spin of the black
holes. The model clearly shows that the outflow power extracted from the disk
increases strongly with the spin of the black hole, inferring that the power of
the observed astrophysical jets has a proportional correspondence with the spin
of the central object. In case of blazars (BL Lacs and Flat Spectrum Radio
Quasars), most of their emission are believed to be originated from their jets.
It is observed that BL Lacs are relatively low luminous than Flat Spectrum
Radio Quasars (FSRQs). The luminosity might be linked to the power of the jet,
which in turn reflects that the nuclear regions of the BL Lac objects have a
relatively low spinning black hole compared to that in the case of FSRQ. If the
extreme gravity is the source to power strong outflows and jets, then the spin
of the black hole, perhaps, might be the fundamental parameter to account for
the observed astrophysical processes in an accretion powered system.

two sources fulfills only the first of these two requirements, but allows to
