are measured to be proportional to each other at z < ~3. This close
correspondence between SF and BHA would naturally yield a BH mass-galaxy mass
correlation, whereas a BH mass-bulge mass correlation is observed. To explore
this apparent contradiction we study the SF in spheroid-dominated galaxies
between z=1 and the present day. We use 903 galaxies from the COMBO-17 survey
with M* >2x10^10M_sun, ultraviolet and infrared-derived SFRs from Spitzer and
GALEX, and morphologies from GEMS HST/ACS imaging. Using stacking techniques,
we find that <25% of all SF occurs in spheroid-dominated galaxies (Sersic index
n>2.5), while the BHAR that we would expect if the global scalings held is
three times higher. This rules out the simplest picture of co-evolution, in
which SF and BHA trace each other at all times. These results could be
explained if SF and BHA occur in the same events, but offset in time, for
example at different stages of a merger event. However, one would then expect
to see the corresponding star formation activity in early-stage mergers, in
conflict with observations. We conclude that the major episodes of SF and BHA
occur in different events, with the bulk of SF happening in isolated disks and
most BHA occurring in major mergers. The apparent global co-evolution results
from the regulation of the BH growth by the potential well of the galactic
spheroid, which includes a major contribution from disrupted disk stars.

the nature of the Regge limit for a CFT correlator, we use its conformal
partial wave expansion to obtain an impact parameter representation encoding
the exchange of a spin j Reggeon for any value of the coupling constant. The
CFT impact parameter space is the three-dimensional hyperbolic space H3, which
is the impact parameter space for high energy scattering in the dual AdS space.
We determine the small-x structure functions associated to the exchange of a
Reggeon. We discuss unitarization from the point of view of scattering in AdS
and comment on the validity of the eikonal approximation.
  We then focus on the weak coupling limit of the theory where the amplitude is
dominated by the exchange of the BFKL pomeron. Conformal invariance fixes the
form of the vector impact factor and its decomposition in transverse spin 0 and
spin 2 components. Our formalism reproduces exactly the general results predict
by the Regge theory, both for a scalar target and for gamma*-gamma* scattering.
We compute current impact factors for the specific examples of N=4 SYM and QCD,
obtaining very simple results. In the case of the R-current of N=4 SYM, we show
that the transverse spin 2 component vanishes. We conjecture that the impact
factors of all chiral primary operators of N=4 SYM only have components with 0

supernova remnants. We measure P-dot = 8.68(9)E-18, and find no evidence for
timing noise or variations in X-ray flux over 4.8 yr. In the dipole spin-down
formalism, this implies a surface magnetic field strength B_s = 3.1E10 G, the
smallest ever measured for a young neutron star, and consistent with being a
fossil field. In combination with upper limits on B_s from other CCO pulsars,
this is strong evidence in favor of the ""anti-magnetar"" explanation for their
low luminosity and lack of magnetospheric activity or synchrotron nebulae.
While this dipole field is small, it can prevent accretion of sufficient
fall-back material so that the observed X-ray luminosity of L_x = 5.3E33(d/7.1

structures are observed in correlations of particles associated with a jet
trigger (the hard ridge) and in correlations without a trigger (the soft
ridge). The long range rapidity behavior requires that the correlation
originates in the earliest stage of the collision, and probes properties of the
production mechanism. Glasma initial conditions as predicted by the theory of
Color Glass Condensate and provide a and early stage correlation that naturally
extends far in rapidity. We have previously shown that the soft ridge is a
consequence of particles forming from an initial Glasma phase that experience a

ability of yielding reductions of turbulent friction drag. The wall forcing
consists of a stationary distribution of spanwise velocity that alternates in
the streamwise direction. The idea behind the forcing builds upon the existing
technique of the spanwise wall oscillation, and exploits the convective nature
of the flow to achieve an unsteady interaction with turbulence.
  The analysis takes advantage of the equivalent laminar flow, that is solved
analytically to show that the energetic cost of the forcing is unaffected by
turbulence. In a turbulent flow, the alternate forcing is found to behave
similarly to the oscillating wall; in particular an optimal wavelength is found
that yields a maximal reduction of turbulent drag. The energetic performance is
significantly improved, with more than 50% of maximum friction saving at large
intensities of the forcing, and a net energetic saving of 23% for smaller
intensities.
  Such a steady, wall-based forcing may pave the way to passively interacting
with the turbulent flow to achieve drag reduction through a suitable
distribution of roughness, designed to excite a selected streamwise wavelength.

future X-ray observatory IXO will resolve for the first time the metal
distribution in galaxy clusters at the these scales. Heating of plasmas by
shocks and AGN activities can result in non-equilibrium ionization states of
metal ions. We study the effect of the non-equilibrium ionization at linear
scales <50 kpc in galaxy clusters. A condition for non-equilibrium ionization
is derived by comparing the ionization time-scale with the age of hydrodynamic
structures. Modeling of non-equilibrium ionization when the plasma temperature
suddenly change is performed. An analysis of relaxation processes of the FeXXV

conclude that the non-equilibrium ionization of iron can occur in galaxy
clusters if the baryonic overdensity delta is smaller than 11.0/tau, where
tau<<1 is the ratio of the hydrodynamic structure age to the Hubble time. Our
modeling indicates that the emissivity in the helium-like emission lines of
iron increases as a result of deviation from the ionization equilibrium. A slow
process of helium-like ionic fraction relaxation was analyzed. A new way to
determine a shock velocity is proposed.

the double-peak pulse profile is best reproduced if the emission zone lies in a
thin layer just outside the current sheet, and the peaks are mainly contributed
from regions near the light cylinder. The conventional two-pole caustic model
can produce up to four peaks in general, while the conventional outer-gap model
can normally produce only one peak. These results will be useful for

general approach to context-free graphs is proposed via tree sets consisting of
cuts of the graph, and associated structure trees. The existence of tree sets
with certain ""good"" properties is studied. With a tree set, a natural
context-free grammar is associated. These investigations of the structure of
context free pairs, resp. graphs are then applied to study random walk
asymptotics via complex analysis.

  Asynchronous Environments","9 pages, 9 figures",,,,"cs.SE cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Context consistency checking, the checking of specified constraint on
properties of contexts, is essential to context-aware applications. In order to
delineate and adapt to dynamic changes in the pervasive computing environment,
context-aware applications often need to specify and check behavioral
consistency constraints over the contexts. This problem is challenging mainly
due to the distributed and asynchronous nature of pervasive computing
environments. Specifically, the critical issue in checking behavioral
constraints is the temporal ordering of contextual activities. The contextual
activities usually involve multiple context collecting devices, which are
fully-decentralized and interact in an asynchronous manner. However, existing
context consistency checking schemes do not work in asynchronous environments,
since they implicitly assume the availability of a global clock or relay on
synchronized interactions.
  To this end, we propose the Ordering Global Activity (OGA) algorithm, which
detects the ordering of the global activities based on predicate detection in
asynchronous environments. The essence of our approach is the message causality
and its on-the-fly coding as logic vector clocks in asynchronous environments.
We implement the Middleware Infrastructure for Predicate detection in
Asynchronous environments (MIPA), over which the OGA algorithm is implemented
and evaluated. The evaluation results show the impact of asynchrony on the
checking of behavioral consistency constraints, which justifies the primary
motivation of our work. They also show that OGA can achieve accurate checking
of behavioral consistency constraints in dynamic pervasive computing
environments.

electric charge and constrained to move on a non singular static surface in
ordinary three dimensional space in the presence of arbitrary configurations of

embedding space we show that a charged particle with charge $q$ couples to a
term linear in $qA^3M$, where $A^3$ is the transverse component of the
electromagnetic vector potential and $M$ is the mean curvature in the surface.
This term cancels exactly a curvature contribution to the orbital magnetic
moment of the particle. It is shown that particles, independently of the value
of the charge, in addition to the known couplings to the geometry also couple
to the mean curvature in the surface when a Neumann type of constraint is
applied on the transverse fluctuations of the wave function. In contrast to a
Dirrichlet constraint on the transverse fluctuations a Neumann type of
constraint on these degrees of freedom will in general make the equations of
motion non separable. The exceptions are the equations of motion for
electrically neutral particles on surfaces with constant mean curvature. In the
presence of electric currents the equation of motion of a charged particle is
generally non separable independently of the coupling to the geometry and the
boundary constraints.

potential is analytically considered within the mean field Gross-Pitaevskii
approximation. Reformulating the problem of reflectionless transmission as a
quasi-linear eigenvalue problem for the potential depth, an approximation for
the specific height of the potential that supports reflectionless transmission
of the incoming matter wave is derived via modification of the
Rayleigh-Schroedinger time-independent perturbation theory. The approximation
provides highly accurate description of the resonance position for all the
resonance orders if the nonlinearity parameter is small compared with the
incoming particles chemical potential. Notably, the result for the first
transmission resonance turns out to be exact, i.e., the derived formula for the
resonant potential height gives the exact value of the first nonlinear
resonances position for all the allowed variation range of the involved
parameters, the nonlinearity parameter and chemical potential. This has been
shown by constructing the exact solution of the problem for the first
resonance. Furthermore, the presented approximation reveals that, in contrast
to the linear case, in the nonlinear case reflectionless transmission may occur
not only for potential wells but also for potential barriers with positive
potential height. It also shows that the nonlinear shift of the resonance
position from the position of the corresponding linear resonance is
approximately described as a linear function of the resonance order. Finally, a
compact (yet, highly accurate) analytic formula for the n-th order resonance
position is constructed via combination of analytical and numerical methods.

center of mass energy $s=320$ GeV gives access to both the low Bjorken-$x$
domain and regime of high momentum transfers $Q$. Recently the H1 collaboration
reported a high precision measurement of the structure function $F_2$ at low
$x$ leading to tight constraints on the sea quark and gluon densities. Both the
H1 and ZEUS collaborations measure the structure function $F_L$ which provides
an important cross check of the conventional QCD picture. This measurement is
recently extended by H1 to low $Q^2$ where small $x$ corrections may play
important role. An ultimate precision of the deep inelastic scattering cross
section measurement is achieved by combining the measurements of the H1 and
ZEUS collaborations. The combined data are used as a sole input to a QCD fit to
obtained HERA PDF set. New measurements of inclusive $e^-p$ neutral and charged
current scattering cross sections by the ZEUS collaboration at high $Q^2$
improve precision in this kinematic domain. H1 analysis of the DIS high $P_t$
jet production cross section is used for a determination of the strong coupling
constant $\alpha_S$. Separation of the strange quark density from the total sea
is obtained by the HERMES collaboration using tagged $K^{\pm}$ production.

the feasibility of an experimental access to transition form factors is

rather subtle to tell which couplings are relevant or irrelevant. We propose a
powerful classification scheme to build up the hierarchy of the relevant
couplings by a scaling Ansatz found numerically. To demonstrate its superiority
over the conventional classification for the relevant couplings, we apply this
scheme to a controversial phase transition in the two-leg ladder and show that
it should be a non-trivial crossover instead. The scaling Ansatz we propose
here can classify the relevant couplings in hierarchical order without any
ambiguity and can improve significantly how we interpret the numerical outcomes
in general renormalization group methods.

making the detection hard in experiments. We revisit this important problem
from the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian on the square lattice with
appropriate boundary conditions. Significant spectral weights in the midgap
regime are spotted, leading to easy detection of the Andreev bound states in
experiments. Peaks in the momentum-resolved local density of states appear and
lead to enhanced quasiparticle interferences at specific momenta. We analyze
the locations of these magic spots and propose they can be verified in
experiments by the Fourier-transformed scanning tunneling spectroscopy.
