requires the use of photometric redshifts. But as these surveys become more
ambitious, and as we seek to perform increasingly accurate measurements, it
becomes crucial to take proper account of the photometric redshift
uncertainties. Ideally the uncertainties can be directly measured using a
comparison to spectroscopic redshifts, but this may yield misleading results
since spectroscopic samples are frequently small and not representative of the
parent photometric samples. We present a simple and powerful empirical method
to constrain photometric redshift uncertainties in the absence of spectroscopic
redshifts. Close pairs of galaxies on the sky have a significant probability of
being physically associated, and therefore of lying at nearly the same
redshift. The difference in photometric redshifts in close pairs is therefore a
measure of the redshift uncertainty. Some observed close pairs will arise from
chance projections along the line of sight, but it is straightforward to
perform a statistical correction for this effect. We demonstrate the technique
using both simulated data and actual observations, and discuss how its
usefulness can be limited by the presence of systematic photometric redshift
errors. Finally, we use this technique to show how photometric redshift
accuracy can depend on galaxy type.

on a side and a Monte Carlo Lyman-alpha (Lya) radiative transfer code to model
Lyman Alpha Emitters (LAEs) at z~5.7. The model introduces Lya radiative
transfer as the single factor for transforming the intrinsic Lya emission
properties into the observed ones. Spatial diffusion of Lya photons from
radiative transfer results in extended Lya emission and only the central part
with high surface brightness can be observed. Because of radiative transfer,
the appearance of LAEs depends on density and velocity structures in
circumgalactic and intergalactic media as well as the viewing angle, which
leads to a broad distribution of apparent (observed) Lya luminosity for a given
intrinsic Lya luminosity. Radiative transfer also causes frequency diffusion of
Lya photons. The resultant Lya line is asymmetric with a red tail. The peak of
the Lya line shifts towards longer wavelength and the shift is anti-correlated
with the apparent to intrinsic Lya luminosity ratio. The simple radiative
transfer model provides a new framework for studying LAEs. It is able to
explain an array of observed properties of z~5.7 LAEs in Ouchi et al. (2008),
producing Lya spectra, morphology, and apparent Lya luminosity function (LF)
similar to those seen in observation. The broad distribution of apparent Lya
luminosity at fixed UV luminosity provides a natural explanation for the
observed UV LF, especially the turnover towards the low luminosity end. The
model also reproduces the observed distribution of Lya equivalent width (EW)
and explains the deficit of UV bright, high EW sources. Because of the broad
distribution of the apparent to intrinsic Lya luminosity ratio, the model
predicts effective duty cycles and Lya escape fractions for LAEs.

singularity point is known to be approximately rank 1. Thus, the approximate
rank of Yukawa matrices in low-energy effective theory of generic F-theory
compactifications are minimum of either the number of generations N_gen = 3 or
the number of singularity points of certain types. If there is a geometry with

Yukawa eigenvalues in F-theory compactifications. A solution in the literature
so far is to take an appropriate factorization limit. In this article, we
propose an alternative solution to the hierarchical structure problem (which
requires to tune some parameters) by studying how zero mode wavefunctions
depend on complex structure moduli. In this solution, the N_gen x N_gen CKM

include the total mass distribution profile logarithmic slope gamma' and the

well-motivated priors for them, and so turn the major systematic errors into
statistical ones. The HST images provide one such prior, constraining the lens
mass density profile logarithmic slope to be gamma'=2.08+/-0.03; a combination
of numerical simulations and photometric observations of the B1608+656 field
provides an estimate of the prior for kappa_ext: 0.10 +0.08/-0.05. This latter

work on this system, the new data provide an increase in precision of more than
a factor of two. In combination with the WMAP 5-year data set, we find that the

contrast to Fisher's equation which bases it on the present population. The
model therefore takes into account the fact that new additions to the adult fly
population are, in actual fact, the descendents of a population which existed
one puparial duration ago, furthermore, that this puparial duration is
temperature dependent. Artificially imposed mortality is modelled as a
proportion at a constant rate. Fisher's equation is also solved as a formality.
  The temporary imposition of a 2 % $\mathrm{day}^{-1}$ mortality everywhere
outside the reserve for a period of 2 years will have no lasting effect on the
influence of the reserve on either the Glossina austeni or the G. brevipalpis
populations, although it certainly will eradicate tsetse from poor habitat,
outside the reserve. A 5 $\mathrm{km}$-wide barrier with a minimum mortality of
4 % $\mathrm{day}^{-1}$, throughout, will succeed in isolating a worst-case, G.
austeni population and its associated trypanosomiasis from the surrounding
areas. A more optimistic estimate of its mobility suggests a mortality of 2 %
$\mathrm{day}^{-1}$ will suffice. For a given target-related mortality, more
mobile species are found to be more vulnerable to eradication than more
sedentary species, while the opposite is true for containment.

video analytics tasks. Although its many variants exist, they all share the
underlying assumption that photometric scene properties are either static or
exhibit temporal stationarity. While this works in some applications, the model
fails when one is interested in discovering {\it changes in scene dynamics}
rather than those in a static background; detection of unusual pedestrian and
motor traffic patterns is but one example. We propose a new model and
computational framework that address this failure by considering stationary
scene dynamics as a ``background'' with which observed scene dynamics are
compared. Central to our approach is the concept of an {\it event}, that we
define as short-term scene dynamics captured over a time window at a specific
spatial location in the camera field of view. We compute events by
time-aggregating motion labels, obtained by background subtraction, as well as
object descriptors (e.g., object size). Subsequently, we characterize events
probabilistically, but use a low-memory, low-complexity surrogates in practical
implementation. Using these surrogates amounts to {\it behavior subtraction}, a
new algorithm with some surprising properties. As demonstrated here, behavior
subtraction is an effective tool in anomaly detection and localization. It is
resilient to spurious background motion, such as one due to camera jitter, and
is content-blind, i.e., it works equally well on humans, cars, animals, and
other objects in both uncluttered and highly-cluttered scenes. Clearly,
treating video as a collection of events rather than colored pixels opens new
possibilities for video analytics.

correlation function in terms of coherent-state propagator and corresponding
Q-function is presented. On the basis that the involved functions are generally
exponential in nature, obtaining the two-time second-order correlation function
is essentially claimed to be reduced to carrying out relatively simple
integrations. Fundamentally, the time dependence of the operators is
transferred to the density operator. Moreover, manipulation in reordering the
operators is performed by applying the usual trace operation. With all details,
it is basically observed that the two-time correlation can be readily
determined once the pertinent coherent-state propagator or Q-function is known.
Since working with c-number equation is far more handy than the associated
operator equation, it is expected that the results derived in this contribution

Yet, we recovered the correlation by using a radiatively injected common tone

Specifically, we investigate the effects of coherent coupling between the

In the first part of the paper, we use a three-level density-matrix model to
obtain useful analytical expressions for current transport through the injector
barrier in a QCL. An expression for the slope discontinuity in the
current-voltage characteristics at the lasing threshold is derived. This value
is shown to be a direct measure of the population inversion at threshold, and
contradicts the previously held belief of it being indicative of ratio of the
laser level lifetimes. In the second part of the paper, we use density matrices
to compute the gain spectrum for a resonant-phonon terahertz QCL design. The
large anticrossing of the doublet of lower radiative levels is reflected in a
broad gain linewidth due to a coherent RT assisted depopulation process. At
certain bias conditions, the gain spectrum exhibits double peaks which is
supported by experimental observations.

particle to have both vector and axial-vector couplings to ordinary fermions,
we systematically study its contributions to various processes involving
b-flavored mesons, including B-Bbar mixing as well as leptonic, inclusive, and
exclusive B decays. Using the latest experimental data, we extract bounds on
its couplings and subsequently estimate upper limits for the branching ratios
of a number of B decays with the new particle. This can serve to guide
experimental searches for the particle in order to help confirm or refute its
existence.

traces regions in clusters with shocks or turbulence, probably produced by
cluster mergers. Some models of diffuse radio emission in clusters indicate
that virtually all clusters should contain diffuse radio sources with a steep
spectrum. External accretion shocks associated with filamentary structures of
galaxies could also accelerate electrons to relativistic energies and hence
produce diffuse synchrotron emitting regions. Here we report on Giant Metrewave
Radio Telescope (GMRT) observations of a sample of steep spectrum sources from
the 74 MHz VLSS survey. These sources are diffuse and not associated with
nearby galaxies.
  Aims: The main aim of the observations is to search for diffuse radio
emission associated with galaxy clusters or the cosmic web.
  Methods: We carried out GMRT 610 MHz continuum observations of unidentified
diffuse steep spectrum sources.
  Results: We have constructed a sample of diffuse steep spectrum sources,
selected from the 74 MHz VLSS survey. We identified eight diffuse radio sources
probably all located in clusters. We found five radio relics, one cluster with
a giant radio halo and a radio relic, and one radio mini-halo. By complementing
our observations with measurements from the literature we find correlations
between the physical size of relics and the spectral index, in the sense that
smaller relics have steeper spectra. Furthermore, larger relics are mostly
located in the outskirts of clusters while smaller relics are located closer to
the cluster center.

hierarchical galaxy formation. Several of M31's satellites are being disrupted
by M31's tidal field, among them M33 and And I, while other tidal structures
are the corpses of satellites already destroyed. The extent to which M31's
satellites have left battle scars upon it is unknown; to answer this we need
accurate orbits and masses of the perturbers. I focus here on M31's
150-kpc-long Giant Southern Stream (GSS) as an example of how these can be
determined even in the absence of a visible progenitor. Comparing N-body models
to photometric and spectroscopic data, I find this stream resulted from the
disruption of a large satellite galaxy by a close passage about 750 Myr ago.
The GSS is connected to several other debris structures in M31's halo. Bayesian
sampling of the simulations estimates the progenitor's initial mass as
log(Mstar/Msun) = 9.5 +- 0.2, showing it was one of the most massive Local
Group galaxies until quite recently. The stream model constrains M31's halo
mass to be (1.8+-0.5)x10^{12} Msun. While these small uncertainties neglect
several important degrees of freedom, they are likely to remain good even with
a more complete model. Future work on M31's satellites and streams will provide
independent constraints on M31's mass, and reveal the shared history of M31 and
its halo components.

interference pattern at the exit of a three-grating Mach-Zehnder interferometer

atomic wave function describing the state of the atom before the scattering
process takes place, but only induces a certain shift and change of its phase.
We find that the visibility of the interference strongly depends on the
statistical distribution of transferred momenta to the atom during the
photon-atom scattering event. This also explains the experimentally observed
(Chapman et al 1995 Phys. Rev. Lett. 75 2783) dependence of the visibility on
the ratio d_p/\lambda_i = y'_{12} (2\pi/kd\lambda_i), where y'_{12} is distance
between the place where the scattering event occurs and the first grating, k is
the wave number of the atomic center-of-mass motion, $d$ is the grating
constant and \lambda_i is the photon wavelength. Furthermore, it is remarkable
that photon-atom scattering events happen experimentally within the Fresnel
region, i.e. the near field region, associated with the first grating, which
should be taken into account when drawing conclusions about the relevance of
""which-way"" information for the interference visibility.

that the line profiles were strongly changing during the monitoring period,

4151 with, at least, three kinematically distinct regions: one that contributes
to the blue line wing, one to the line core and one to the red line wing. Such
variation can be caused by an accelerating outflow starting very close to the
black hole, where the red part may come from the region {closer to the black
hole than the blue part, which is coming} from the region having the highest
outflow velocities. Taking into account the fact that the BLR of NGC 4151 has a
complex geometry (probably affected by an outflow) and that a portion of the
broad line emission seems to have not a pure photoionization origin, one can
ask the question whether the study of the BLR by reverberation mapping may be

autocorrelation functions w_p(r_p) for the light of galaxies in the five SDSS
photometric bands. Comparison with the analogous stellar mass autocorrelation,
estimated in a previous paper, shows that stellar luminosity is less strongly
clustered than stellar mass in all bands and on all scales. Over the full
nonlinear range 10 kpc/h < r_p < 10 Mpc/h our autocorrelation estimates are
extremely well represented by power laws. The parameters of the corresponding
spatial functions \xi(r) = (r/r_0)^\gamma vary systematically from r_0=4.5
Mpc/h and \gamma=-1.74 for the bluest band (the u band) to r_0=5.8 Mpc/h and
\gamma=-1.83 for the reddest one (the z band). These may be compared with
r_0=6.1 Mpc/h and \gamma=-1.84 for the stellar mass. Ratios of w_p(r_p) between
two given wavebands are proportional to the mean colour of correlated stars at
projected distance r_p from a randomly chosen star. The ratio of the stellar
mass and luminosity autocorrelations measures an analogous mean stellar
mass-to-light ratio (M*/L). All colours get redder and all mass-to-light ratios
get larger with decreasing r_p, with the amplitude of the effects decreasing
strongly to redder passbands. Even for the u-band the effects are quite modest,

amount to a few mA, and the bandwidths (FWHM) are most often near 0.7 A. No
preferred wavenumber spacings among the 414 bands are identified which could

corrected for gravitational lensing. This corresponds to a SFR=90-180 solar
masses per year, where the upper range is consistent with that derived from the
Paschen-alpha luminosity. While the L(8 micron) / L(Pa-alpha) ratio is
consistent with the extrapolated relation observed in local galaxies and
star-forming regions, the rest-frame 24 micron luminosity is significantly
lower with respect to local galaxies of comparable Paschen-alpha luminosity.
Thus, SMM J163554.2+661225 arguably lacks a warmer dust component (T ~ 70 K),
which is associated with deeply embedded star formation, and which contrasts
with local galaxies with comparable SFRs. Rather, the starburst is consistent
with star-forming local galaxies with intrinsic luminosities, L(IR) ~ 10^10
solar luminosities, but ""scaled-up"" by a factor of 10-100.

structure of monolayer and bilayer graphene using a first principles density
functional based electronic structure method and a local exchange correlation
approximation. We consider two crystalline substrates, SiO2 (or alpha-quartz)
and Al2O3 (alpha-alumina or sapphire), each with two surface terminations. We
focus on the role of substrate surface dangling states and their passivation in
perturbing the linear energy spectrum of graphene. On non-passivated surface
terminations, with the relaxation of top surface layers, only Si-terminated
quartz retains the linear band structure of graphene due to relatively large
equilibrium separation from the graphene layer whereas the other three surface
terminations considerably distort it. However, without relaxations of the top
surface layer atoms, linear bands appear in the electronic spectrum but with
the Dirac point shifted away from the Fermi level. Interestingly, with a second
carbon layer on non-passivated oxygen terminated Quartz, with top surface
layers relaxation, graphene features appear in the spectrum but sapphire with
both surface terminations shows perturbed features even with two carbon layers.
By passivating the surface dangling states with hydrogen atoms and without top
layer atomic relaxations, the electron-hole symmetry occurs exactly at the
Fermi level. This suggests that surface dangling states play a less important
role than the atomic relaxations of the top surface layers in distorting the
linear spectrum. In all cases we find that the first layer of graphene forms
ripples, much like in suspended graphene, but the strength of rippling is found
to be weaker probably due to the presence of the substrate.

accretion disks around irradiated by a central X-ray source. Based on earlier
observational clues and theoretical arguments, we focus our attention on a
subset of these winds, namely those with radial density dependence n(r)~1/r. We
employ the photoionization code XSTAR to compute the ionic abundances of a
large number of ions of different elements and then compile their line-of-sight
(LOS) absorption columns. Particular attention is paid to the absorption
measure distribution (AMD), namely their Hydrogen-equivalent column per
logarithmic ionization parameter \xi interval, d N_H/(d \log \xi), which
provides a measure of the winds' radial density profiles. For n(r)~1/r the AMD
is found to be independent of \xi, in good agreement with its behavior inferred
from the X-ray spectra of several AGNs. For the specific wind structure and
X-ray spectrum we also compute detailed absorption line profiles for a number
of ions to obtain their LOS velocities, v~100-300 km/sec (at \log \xi~2-3) for
Fe XVII and v~1,000-4,000 km/sec (at \log \xi~4-5) for Fe XXV, in good
agreement with the observation. Our models describe the X-ray absorption
properties of these winds with only two parameters, namely the mass-accretion
rate \dot{m} and LOS angle \theta. The probability of obscuration of the X-ray
ionizing source in these winds decreases with increasing \dot{m} and increases
steeply with \theta. As such, we concur with previous authors that these wind
configurations, viewed globally, incorporate all the requisite properties of
the parsec scale ""torii"" invoked in AGN unification schemes. We indicate that a
combination of the AMD and absorption line profile observations can uniquely
determine these model parameters and their bearing on AGN population
demographics.

at small \xi is studied in N=2 supersymmetric gauge theory with the U(N) gauge
group and N_f>N (here \xi is the Fayet--Iliopoulos parameter). We find that at
strong coupling a dual non-Abelian weakly coupled N=2 theory exists which
describes low-energy physics at small \xi. The dual gauge group is U(N_f-N).
The dual theory has N_f flavors of light dyons, to be compared with N_f quarks
in the original U(N) theory. Both theories support non-Abelian strings. In each
of these two regimes there are two varieties of physical excitations:
elementary fields and nonperturbative composite states bound by confining
strings. These varieties interchange upon transition from one regime to the
other. We conjecture that the composite stringy states can be related to
Seiberg's M fields.

two-dimensional system of frictional, bi-dispersed disks subject to
quasi-static, uniaxial compression at zero granular temperature. Currently
accepted results show the jamming transition occurs at a critical packing
fraction $\phi_c$. In contrast, we observe the first compression cycle exhibits
{\it fragility} - metastable configuration with simultaneous jammed and
un-jammed clusters - over a small interval in packing fraction ($\phi_1 < \phi
< \phi_2$). The fragile state separates the two conditions that define $\phi_c$
with an exponential rise in pressure starting at $\phi_1$ and an exponential
fall in disk displacements ending at $\phi_2$. The results are explained
through a percolation mechanism of stressed contacts where cluster growth
exhibits strong spatial correlation with disk displacements. Measurements with
several disk materials of varying elastic moduli $E$ and friction coefficients
$\mu$, show friction directly controls the start of the fragile state, but
indirectly controls the exponential slope. Additionally, we experimentally
confirm recent predictions relating the dependence of $\phi_c$ on $\mu$. Under
repetitive loading (compression), the system exhibits hysteresis in pressure,
and the onset $\phi_c$ increases slowly with repetition number. This friction
induced hysteretic creep is interpreted as the granular pack's evolution from a
metastable to an eventual structurally stable configuration. It is shown to
depend upon the quasi-static step size $\Delta \phi$ which provides the only
perturbative mechanism in the experimental protocol, and the friction
coefficient $\mu$ which acts to stabilize the pack.

of the proposed program include high precision measurements of binding energies
of hypernuclei by using a high resolution pion spectrometer, HpiS. The average
values of binding energies will be determined within an accuracy of ~10 keV or
better. Therefore, the crucial point of this program is an absolute calibration
of the HpiS with accuracy 10E-4 or better. The merging of continuous wave
laser-based precision optical-frequency metrology with mode-locked ultrafast
lasers has led to precision control of the visible frequency spectrum produced
by mode-locked lasers. Such a phase-controlled mode-locked laser forms the
foundation of an optical clock or femtosecond optical frequency comb (OFC)
generator, with a regular comb of sharp lines with well defined frequencies.
Combination of this technique with a recently developed radio frequency (RF)
phototube results in a new tool for precision time measurement. We are
proposing a new time-of-flight (TOF) system based on an RF phototube and OFC
technique. The proposed TOF system achieves 10 fs instability level and opens
new possibilities for precise measurements in nuclear physics such as an
absolute calibration of magnetic spectrometers within accuracy 10E-4 - 10E-5.

assumed that the synchrotron surface brightness is linearly proportional to
surface density of galaxies. We also sampled the cross-correlation function
using 24 distant fields of the same size from the Bonn survey, to better assess
the noise properties. Though we obtained a null result, we found that by adding
a signal weighted by the 2MASS image with a filament (peak) surface brightness

non-causally knows the message of the other, termed the cognitive interference
channel, has remained open since its inception in 2005. A number of subtly
differing achievable rate regions and outer bounds have been derived, some of
which are tight under specific conditions. In this work we present a new
unified inner bound for the discrete memoryless cognitive interference channel.
We show explicitly how it encompasses all known discrete memoryless achievable
rate regions as special cases. The presented achievable region was recently
used in deriving the capacity region of the general deterministic cognitive
interference channel, and thus also the linear high-SNR deterministic
approximation of the Gaussian cognitive interference channel. The high-SNR
deterministic approximation was then used to obtain the capacity of the
Gaussian cognitive interference channel to within 1.87 bits.

The degraded compound multi-receiver wiretap channel consists of two groups of
users and a group of eavesdroppers, where, if we pick an arbitrary user from
each group of users and an arbitrary eavesdropper, they satisfy a certain
Markov chain. We study two different communication scenarios for this channel.
In the first scenario, the transmitter wants to send a confidential message to
users in the first (stronger) group and a different confidential message to
users in the second (weaker) group, where both messages need to be kept
confidential from the eavesdroppers. For this scenario, we assume that there is
only one eavesdropper. We obtain the secrecy capacity region for the general
discrete memoryless channel model, the parallel channel model, and the Gaussian
parallel channel model. For the Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
channel model, we obtain the secrecy capacity region when there is only one
user in the second group. In the second scenario we study, the transmitter
sends a confidential message to users in the first group which needs to be kept
confidential from the second group of users and the eavesdroppers. Furthermore,
the transmitter sends a different confidential message to users in the second
group which needs to be kept confidential only from the eavesdroppers. For this
scenario, we do not put any restriction on the number of eavesdroppers. As in
the first scenario, we obtain the secrecy capacity region for the general

superconducting circuit differing by the presence or absence of a single Cooper
pair on a metallic island were observed for the first time. This result
immediately stimulated the development of several other types of
superconducting quantum circuits behaving as artificial atoms, thus bridging
mesoscopic and atomic physics. Interestingly, none of these circuits fully
implements the now almost 30 year old proposal of A. J. Leggett to observe
coherent oscillations between two states differing by the presence or absence
of a single fluxon trapped in the superconducting loop interrupted by a
Josephson tunnel junction. This phenomenon of reversible quantum tunneling
between two classically separable states, known as Macroscopic Quantum
Coherence (MQC), is regarded crucial for precision tests of whether macroscopic
systems such as circuits fully obey quantum mechanics. In this article, we
report the observation of such oscillations with sub-GHz frequency and quality
factor larger than 500. We achieved this result with two innovations. First,
our ring has an inductance four orders of magnitude larger than that considered
by Leggett, combined with a junction in the charging regime, a parameter choice
never addressed in previous experiments. Second, readout is performed with a
novel dispersive scheme which eliminates the electromagnetic relaxation process
induced by the measurement circuit (Purcell effect). Moreover, the reset of the
system to its ground state is naturally built into this scheme, working even if
the transition energy is smaller than that of temperature fluctuations. As we
argue, the MQC transition could therefore be, contrary to expectations, the
basis of a superconducting qubit of improved coherence and readout fidelity.

line which approaches the null (or recedes from it), while the fan is a surface
of field lines which recede from it (or approach it).
  So-called ""torsional spine reconnection"" occurs when field lines in the
vicinity of the fan rotate, with current becoming concentrated along the spine,
so that nearby field lines undergo rotational slippage. In ""torsional fan
reconnection"" field lines near the spine rotate and create a current that is
concentrated in the fan with a rotational flux mismatch and rotational
slippage. In both of these regimes, the spine and fan are perpendicular and
there is no flux transfer across spine or fan. The third regime, called
""spine-fan reconnection"", is the most common in practice and combines elements
of the previous spine and fan models. In this case, in response to a generic
shearing motion, the null point collapses to form a current sheet that is
focused at the null itself, in a sheet that locally spans both the spine and
fan. In this regime the spine and fan are no longer perpendicular and there is
flux transfer across both of them.

gas with a general spin-orbit interaction is investigated. For isotropic energy
spectrum, the in-plane current-induced spin polarization is found to be
dependent on the electron density for non-linear spin-orbit interaction and
increases with the increment of sheet density, in contrast to the case for $\bm
k$-linear spin-orbit coupling model. The numerical evaluation is performed for
InAs/InSb heterojunction with spin-orbit coupling of both linear and cubic
spin-orbit coupling types. For $\delta$-type short-range electron-impurity
scattering, it is found that the current-induced spin polarization increases
with increasing the density when cubic spin-orbit couplings are considered.
However, for remote disorders, a rapid enhancement of current-induced spin
polarization is always observed at high electron density, even in the case
without cubic spin-orbit coupling. This result demonstrates the
collision-related feature of current-induced spin polarization. The effects of
different high order spin-orbit couplings on spin polarization can be
comparable.

Instead of the more standard two-photon absorption, this work concentrates on
molecular biexciton created by photon absorption in an exciton gas. We first
determine the appropriate set of coordinates in real and momentum spaces to
describe one biexciton as two interacting excitons. We then turn to second
quantization and introduce the ""Fourier transform in the exciton sense"" of the
biexciton wave function which is the relevant quantity for oscillator strength.
We find that, like for trion, the oscillator strength for the formation of one
biexciton out of one photon plus a \emph{single} exciton is extremely small: it
is one biexciton volume divided by one sample volume smaller than the exciton
oscillator strength. However, due to their quantum nature, trion and biexciton
have absorption lines which behave quite differently. Electrons and trions are
fermionic particles impossible to pile up all at the same energy. This would
make the weak trion line spread with electron density, the peak structure only
coming from singular many-body effects. By contrast, the bosonic nature of
exciton and biexciton makes the biexciton peak mainly rise with exciton
density, this rise being simply linear if we forget many-body effects between
the photocreated exciton and the excitons present in the sample.

resulting from condensation of water vapor can produce multiple zonal jets
similar to those on the gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn) and ice giants (Uranus
and Neptune). For plausible water abundances (3-5 times solar on Jupiter/Saturn
and 30 times solar on Uranus/Neptune), our simulations produce ~20 zonal jets
for Jupiter and Saturn and 3 zonal jets on Uranus and Neptune, similar to the
number of jets observed on these planets. Moreover, these Jupiter/Saturn cases
produce equatorial superrotation whereas the Uranus/Neptune cases produce
equatorial subrotation,consistent with the observed equatorial jet direction on
these planets.Sensitivity tests show that water abundance, planetary rotation
rate,and planetary radius are all controlling factors, with water playing the
most important role; modest water abundances, large planetary radii, and fast
rotation rates favor equatorial superrotation, whereas large water abundances
favor equatorial subrotation regardless of the planetary radius and rotation
rate. Given the larger radii, faster rotation rates, and probable lower water
abundances of Jupiter and Saturn relative to Uranus and Neptune, our
simulations therefore provide a possible mechanism for the existence of
equatorial superrotation on Jupiter and Saturn and the lack of superrotation on
Uranus and Neptune. Nevertheless, Saturn poses a possible difficulty, as our

violations of the barotropic and Charney-Stern stability criteria. Overall, our

cannot be excited when there is one phonon in the nonlinear oscillator. To
realize phonon blockade, a superconducting quantum two-level system is coupled
to the nanomechanical resonator and is used to induce the phonon
self-interaction. Using Monte Carlo simulations, the dynamics of the induced

on a membrane with similar curvature radius, their repulsive membrane-mediated

aggregate, induce bud formation, and finally vesiculation. Already with the
bending energy alone our model allows the prediction of bud radii. However, in

original Squeaky Wheel Optimisation's effectiveness and execution speed by
incorporating two extra steps (Selection and Mutation) for added evolution. In
the Evolutionary Squeaky Wheel Optimisation, a cycle of
Analysis-Selection-Mutation-Prioritization-Construction continues until
stopping conditions are reached. The aim of the Analysis step is to identify
below average solution components by calculating a fitness value for all
components. The Selection step then chooses amongst these underperformers and
discards some probabilistically based on fitness. The Mutation step further
discards a few components at random. Solutions can become incomplete and thus
repairs may be required. The repairs are carried out by using the
Prioritization to first produce priorities that determine an order by which the
following Construction step then schedules the remaining components. Therefore,
improvement in the Evolutionary Squeaky Wheel Optimisation is achieved by
selective solution disruption mixed with interative improvement and
constructive repair. Strong experimental results are reported on two different
domains of personnel scheduling: bus and rail driver scheduling and hospital

J14003-6326 using the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). This pulsar is most
likely associated with the bright Chandra X-ray point source lying at the
center of G310.6-1.6, a previously unrecognised Galactic composite supernova
remnant with a bright central non-thermal radio and X-ray nebula, taken to be
the pulsar wind nebula (PWN). PSR J1400-6325 is amongst the most energetic
rotation-powered pulsars in the Galaxy, with a spin-down luminosity of Edot =
5.1E+37 erg.s-1. In the rotating dipole model, the surface dipole magnetic
field strength is B_s = 1.1E+12 G and the characteristic age tau_c = P/2Pdot =
12.7 kyr. The high spin-down power is consistent with the hard spectral indices
of the pulsar and the nebula of 1.22 +/- 0.15 and 1.83 +/- 0.08, respectively,
and a 2-10 keV flux ratio F_PWN/F_PSR ~ 8. Follow-up Parkes observations
resulted in the detection of radio emission at 10 and 20 cm from PSR J1400-6325
at a dispersion measure of ~ 560 cm-3 pc, which implies a relatively large
distance of 10 +/- 3 kpc. However, the resulting location off the Galactic
Plane of ~ 280 pc would be much larger than the typical thickness of the
molecular disk, and we argue that G310.6-1.6 lies at a distance of ~ 7 kpc.
There is no gamma-ray counterpart to the nebula or pulsar in the Fermi data
published so far. A multi-wavelength study of this new composite supernova
remnant, from radio to very-high energy gamma-rays, suggests a young (< 1000
yr) system, formed by a sub-energetic (~ 1E+50 ergs), low ejecta mass (M_ej ~ 3

social groups, are intrinsically complex problems since they strongly depend on
several competitive mechanisms as economic factors, cultural differences and
many others. By identifying a few essential assumptions, and using the
statistical mechanics of complex systems, we propose a novel quantitative
approach that provides a minimal theory for those phenomena. We show that the
competitive interactions in decision making among a population of $N$ host

consciousness"" inside the host community in the sense of the associative memory
of neural networks. The theory leads to a natural quantitative definition of
migrant's ""integration"" inside the community. From the technical point of view
this minimal picture assumes, as control parameters, only general notions like
strength of the random interactions, the ratio among the two party sizes and
the cultural influence. Few steps forward, toward more refined models, which
include some structure on the random interaction topology (as dilution to avoid
the plain mean field approach) and correlations of experiences felt among the
two parties (biasing the distribution of the coupling) are discussed at the
end, where we show the robustness of our approach.

species evolved. Each phylogenetic tree can be seen as a collection of
clusters, subgroups of the species that evolved from a common ancestor. When
phylogenetic trees are obtained for several data sets (e.g. for different
genes), then their clusters are often contradicting. Consequently, the set of
all clusters of such a data set cannot be combined into a single phylogenetic
tree. Phylogenetic networks are a generalization of phylogenetic trees that can
be used to display more complex evolutionary histories, including reticulate
events such as hybridizations, recombinations and horizontal gene transfers.
Here we present the new CASS algorithm that can combine any set of clusters
into a phylogenetic network. We show that the networks constructed by CASS are
usually simpler than networks constructed by other available methods. Moreover,
we show that CASS is guaranteed to produce a network with at most two
reticulations per biconnected component, whenever such a network exists. We
have implemented CASS and integrated it in the freely available Dendroscope

Rosenblatt, was born on September 7, 1926 in New York City and attended City
College of New York before entering graduate school at Cornell University in
1946. After completing his Ph.D. in 1949 under the direction of the renowned
probabilist Mark Kac, the Rosenblatts' moved to Chicago where Murray became an
instructor/assistant professor in the Committee of Statistics at the University
of Chicago. Murray's academic career then took him to the University of Indiana
and Brown University before his joining the University of California at San
Diego in 1964. Along the way, Murray established himself as one of the most
celebrated and leading figures in probability and statistics with particular
emphasis on time series and Markov processes. In addition to being a fellow of
the Institute of Mathematical Statistics and American Association for the
Advancement of Science, he was a Guggenheim fellow (1965--1966, 1971--1972) and
was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1984. Among his many
contributions, Murray conducted seminal work on density estimation, central
limit theorems under strong mixing, spectral domain methods and long memory
processes. Murray and Ady Rosenblatt were married in 1949 and have two
children, Karin and Daniel.

melting of a periodic array of vortices in a thin fluid film, we perform a
direct numerical simulation of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations
forced such that, at low Reynolds numbers, the steady state of the film is a
square lattice of vortices. We find that, as we increase the Reynolds number,
this lattice undergoes a series of nonequilibrium phase transitions, first to a
crystal with a different reciprocal lattice and then to a sequence of crystals
that oscillate in time. Initially the temporal oscillations are periodic; this
periodic behaviour becomes more and more complicated, with increasing Reynolds
number, until the film enters a spatially disordered nonequilibrium statistical
steady that is turbulent. We study this sequence of transitions by using
fluid-dynamics measures, such as the Okubo-Weiss parameter that distinguishes
between vortical and extensional regions in the flow, ideas from nonlinear
dynamics, e.g., \Poincare maps, and theoretical methods that have been
developed to study the melting of an equilibrium crystal or the freezing of a
liquid and which lead to a natural set of order parameters for the crystalline
phases and spatial autocorrelation functions that characterise short- and
long-range order in the turbulent and crystalline phases, respectively.

Hole field, benefits from very deep VLA/GMRT 20cm, 50cm, and 90cm radio data
(all 33 sources are detected at 50cm), and deep 160micron and 70micron Spitzer
data. The 33 sources, with photometric redshifts ~1.5-2.5, were observed at
1.2mm with IRAM-30m/MAMBO to an rms ~0.7-0.8mJy in most cases. Their
millimeter, radio, 7-band Spitzer, and near-IR properties were jointly
analyzed. The entire sample of 33 sources has an average 1.2mm flux density of
1.56+/-0.22mJy and a median of 1.61mJy, so the majority of the sources can be
considered SMGs. Four sources have confirmed 4sigma detections, and nine were
tentatively detected at the 3sigma level. Because of its 24micron selection,
our sample shows systematically lower F_(1.2mm)/F_(24micron) flux ratios than
classical SMGs, probably because of enhanced PAH emission. A median FIR SED was
built by stacking images at the positions of 21 sources in the region of
deepest Spitzer coverage. Its parameters are T_(dust)=37+/-8K,
L_(FIR)=2.5x10^{12}Lo, and SFR=450Mo/yr. The FIR-radio correlation provides
another estimate of L_(FIR) for each source, with an average value of
4.1x10^{12}Lo; however, this value may be overestimated because of some AGN
contribution. Most of our targets are also luminous star-forming BzK galaxies
which constitute a significant fraction of weak SMGs at 1.7<z<2.3.

O(a_s^3) heavy flavor contributions to the Wilson coefficients of the structure
function F_2(x,Q^2) in the limit Q^2 >> m^2, neglecting power corrections. The
massive Wilson coefficients in the asymptotic region are given as convolutions
of massive operator matrix elements (OMEs) and the known light flavor Wilson
coefficients. The former derive from the twist--2 operators emerging in the
light--cone--expansion and are calculated at the 3--loop level for fixed
moments. We also compute the massive OMEs which are needed to evaluate heavy
flavor parton distributions in the variable flavor number scheme to the same
order. All contributions to the Wilson coefficients and OMEs but the genuine
constant terms at O(a_s^3) of the OMEs are derived in terms of quantities,
which are known for general values in the Mellin variable N. For the OMEs
A_{Qg}^(3), A_{qg,Q}^(3) and A_{gg,Q}^(3) the moments N = 2 to 10, for
A_{Qq}^{(3), PS} to N = 12, and for A_{qq,Q}^{(3), NS}, A_{qq,Q}^{(3), PS},
A_{gq,Q}^(3)}to N=14 are computed. These terms contribute to the light flavor
'+'-combinations. For the flavor non-singlet terms, we calculate as well the
odd moments N=1 to 13, corresponding to the light flavor '-'-combinations. We
also obtain moments of the terms ~ T_F of the 3-loop anomalous dimensions in an
independent calculation, which agree with results given in the literature. The
mathematical structure of the occurring momentum integrals and of the final
results in terms of harmonic sums is discussed. We study applications of the

compute the Dq and f(\alpha) spectrum from a time series for any embedding

f(\alpha) curve and subsequently applied to higher dimensional cases. We also
show that the scheme can be effectively adapted for analysing practcal time

completely real. The essential cyclicity implies the presence of directed
cycles, but not vice versa. The problem of characterizing essential cyclicity
in terms of graph topology is difficult and yet unsolved. Its solution is
important for some applications of graph theory, including that in
decentralized control. In the present paper, this problem is solved with
respect to the class of digraphs with ring structure, which models some typical
communication networks. It is shown that the digraphs in this class are
essentially cyclic, except for certain specified digraphs. The main technical
tool we employ is the Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind. A by-product of
this study is a theorem on the zeros of polynomials that differ by one from the
products of Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind. We also consider the
problem of essential cyclicity for weighted digraphs and enumerate the spanning
trees in some digraphs with ring structure.

core-environment system has a continuous density profile with no barrier to
mass flow. The core is an isothermal sphere and the environment is a filament,
a layer, or a uniform medium. The infall is terminated by gas dispersal due to
outflows and turbulence. The distribution of infall durations is a declining
exponential, the simplest waiting-time distribution. The resulting distribution
of protostar masses closely resembles the initial mass function, provided the
environment density is sufficiently high, and the distribution of initial core
masses is sufficiently narrow. The high-mass tail of the mass function
increases strongly with environment density and weakly with environment
dimension. Isolated regions of low environment density form protostars of low
mass from within the parent core. In contrast, clustered regions of high
environment density form protostars of low mass from core gas, and protostars
of high mass from core and environment gas.

cryptography is that whenever a spy tries to eavesdrop the communication he
causes disturbances in the transmission of the message. Ultimately this
unavoidable disturbance is a consequence of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle
that limits the joint knowledge of complementary observables. Now, a problem
remains: in order to initialize quantum key distribution, Alice and Bob need to
share a short shared key in order to be able to identify each other
unambiguously. Therefore a trusted courier is needed. We propose in this paper
a solution to the trusted courrier problem that was inspired by quantum
cryptography. The idea is to encode the key that Alice sends to Bob into
unstable nuclei in such a way that the message gets revealed only after the
courrier has delivered it to Bob. In this approach, we replace Heisenberg
uncertainties by another type of uncertainty, that characterizes the knowledge
of the time at which an unstable nucleus decays. As we shall show, this scheme
makes it possible to refresh a key even in the case that we do not trust the
courier who carries the key.

  compressible Euler equations in physical vacuum","27 pages",,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The free-boundary compressible 1-D Euler equations with moving physical
vacuum boundary are a system of hyperbolic conservation laws which are both
characteristic and degenerate. The physical vacuum singularity (or
rate-of-degeneracy) requires the sound speed $c= \gamma \rho^{\gamma -1}$ to
scale as the square-root of the distance to the vacuum boundary, and has
attracted a great deal of attention in recent years. We establish the existence
of unique solutions to this system on a short time-interval, which are smooth
(in Sobolev spaces) all the way to the moving boundary. The proof is founded on
a new higher-order Hardy-type inequality in conjunction with an approximation
of the Euler equations consisting of a particular degenerate parabolic
regularization. Our regular solutions can be viewed as degenerate viscosity
solutions.

between 4 K and room temperature. We show that the phonon spectrum undergoes a
strong renormalization at TN. The ab-initio calculation we performed on this
compound accurately predict the magnitude and the direction of the phonon
parameters changes across the antiferromagnetic transition, showing that they
are mainly induced by the magnetic order. In this material, we found that the
dielectric constant is mostly from phonon origin. The large change in the
lattice parameters with temperature seen by X-ray diffraction as well as the
A2u phonon softening below TN indicate that magnetic order induced distortions
in MnF2 are compatible with the ferroelectric instabilities observed in TiO2,
FeF2 and other rutile-type fluorides. This study also shows the anomalous
temperature evolution of the lower energy Eu mode in the paramagnetic phase,
which can be compared to that of the B1g one seen by Raman spectroscopy in many
isostructural materials. This was interpreted as being a precursor of a phase
transition from rutile to CaCl2 structure which was observed under pressure in
ZnF2.

is NGC419 in the SMC, where the red clump is composed of a main blob as well as
a distinct secondary feature. This structure is demonstrated to be real and
corresponds to the simultaneous presence of stars which passed through electron
degeneracy after central-hydrogen exhaustion and those that did not. This rare
occurrence in a single cluster allows us to set stringent constraints on its
age and on the efficiency of convective-core overshooting during main-sequence
evolution. We present a more detailed analysis of NGC419, together with a first
look at other populous LMC clusters which are apparently in the same phase:
NGC1751, NGC1783, NGC1806, NGC1846, NGC1852 and NGC1917. We also compare these
Magellanic Cloud cases with their Galactic counterparts, NGC752 and NGC7789. We
emphasise the extraordinary potential of these clusters as absolute calibration
marks on the age scale of stellar populations.

Equation (ODE) model is used to show that pathogen replication rates decline
with host body size but IS response rates remain invariant with body size. An
Agent-Based Model (ABM) is used to investigate two models of IS architecture
that could explain scale invariance of IS response rates. A stage structured
hybrid model is proposed that strikes a balance between the detailed
representation of an ABM and computational tractability of an ODE, by using
them in the initial and latter stages of an infection, respectively.

extracted from thermal lattice QCD calculations of the free-energy of a static

find that at temperatures $T \sim T_c$ the decay widths of the $J/\Psi$ that
depend on the value of the wave function at the origin are enhanced with
respect to the values in vacuum. In the same temperature range the decay width
of the process $\chi_{cJ} \to J/\Psi + \gamma$ is enhanced by approximately a
factor 6 with respect to the value in vacuum. At higher temperatures the
charmonia states dissociate and the widths of both decay processes become
vanishing small.
