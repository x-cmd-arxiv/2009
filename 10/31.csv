rotating dipole in vacuum as a first approximation to the shape of
plasma-filled pulsar magnetosphere. In this paper we revisit the question of
gamma-ray light-curve formation in pulsars in order to ascertain the robustness
of the ""two-pole caustic"" (TPC) and ""outer gap"" (OG) models based on the vacuum
magnetic field. We point out an inconsistency in the literature on the use of
the relativistic aberration formula, where in several works the vacuum field
was treated as known in the instantaneously corotating frame, rather than in
the laboratory frame. With the corrected formula, we find that the peaks in the
light curves predicted from the TPC model using the vacuum field are less
sharp. The sharpness of the peaks in the OG model is less affected by this
change, but the range of magnetic inclination angles and viewing geometries
resulting in double-peaked light curves is reduced. In a realistic
magnetosphere, the modification of field structure near the light cylinder due
to plasma effects may change the shape of the polar cap and the location of the
emission zones. We study the sensitivity of the light curves to different
shapes of the polar cap for static and retarded vacuum dipole fields. In
particular, we consider polar caps traced by the last open field lines and
compare them to circular polar caps. We find that the TPC model is very
sensitive to the shape of the polar cap, and a circular polar cap can lead to
four peaks of emission. The OG model is less affected by polar cap shapes, but
is subject to big uncertainties of applying the vacuum field near the light
cylinder. We conclude that deviations from vacuum field can lead to large
uncertainties in the pulse shapes, and a more realistic force-free field should
be applied to the study of pulsar high energy emission.

vacuum dipole field. This approximation ignores changes in the field structure
caused by the magnetospheric plasma and strong plasma currents. We present the
first results of gamma-ray pulsar light curve modeling using the more realistic
field taken from 3D force-free magnetospheric simulations. Having the geometry
of the field, we apply several prescriptions for the location of the emission
zone, comparing the light curves to observations. We find that the conventional
two-pole caustic model fails to produce double-peak pulse profiles, mainly
because the size of the polar cap in force-free magnetosphere is larger than
the vacuum field polar cap. The conventional outer-gap model is capable of
producing only one peak under general conditions, because a large fraction of
open field lines does not cross the null charge surface. We propose a novel
""separatrix layer"" model, where the high-energy emission originates from a thin
layer on the open field lines just inside of the separatrix that bounds the
open flux tube. The emission from this layer generates two strong caustics on
the sky map due to the effect we term ""Sky Map Stagnation"" (SMS). It is related
to the fact that force-free field asymptotically approaches the field of a
rotating split monopole, and the photons emitted on such field lines in the
outer magnetosphere arrive to the observer in phase. The double-peak light
curve is a natural consequence of SMS. We show that most features of the
currently available gamma-ray pulsar light curves can be reasonably well
reproduced and explained with the sepatratrix model using the force-free field.
Association of the emission region with the current sheet will guide more
detailed future studies of the magnetospheric acceleration physics.

submillimetre-faint, star-forming radio galaxies (SFRGs) which are thought to
be ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) possibly dominated by warmer dust
(T_dust ~> 40 K) than submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) of similar luminosities.
Four other CO-observed SFRGs are included from the literature, and all
observations are taken at the Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) in the
compact configuration. Ten of the sixteen SFRGs observed in CO (63%) are
detected at >4sigma with a mean inferred molecular gas mass of ~2*10^10 M_sun.
SFRGs trend slightly above the local ULIRG L_FIR-L'_CO relation. Since SFRGs
are about two times fainter in radio luminosity but exhibit similar CO
luminosities to SMGs, this suggests SFRGs are slightly more efficient star
formers than SMGs at the same redshifts. SFRGs also have a narrow mean CO line
width, 320+-80km/s. SFRGs bridge the gap between properties of very luminous
>5*10^12 L_sun SMGs and those of local ULIRGs and are consistent with
intermediate stage major mergers. We suspect that more moderate-luminosity
SMGs, not yet surveyed in CO, would show similar molecular gas properties to
SFRGs. The AGN fraction of SFRGs is consistent with SMGs and is estimated to be
0.3+-0.1, suggesting that SFRGs are observed near the peak phase of star
formation activity and not in a later, post-SMG enhanced AGN phase. This CO
survey of SFRGs serves as a pilot project for the much more extensive survey of
Herschel and SCUBA-2 selected sources which only partially overlap with SMGs.
Better constraints on CO properties of a diverse high-z ULIRG population are
needed from ALMA to determine the evolutionary origin of extreme starbursts,
and what role ULIRGs serve in catalyzing the formation of massive stellar
systems in the early Universe.

in the LMC, of which 82 appear to be genuine YSOs. More than 95% of the YSOs
are found to be associated with molecular clouds. YSOs are seen in three
different kinds of environments in the H$\alpha$ images: in dark clouds, inside
or on the tip of bright-rimmed dust pillars, and in small H II regions.
Comparisons of spectral energy distributions for YSOs in these three different
kinds of environments suggest that YSOs in dark clouds are the youngest, YSOs
with small H II regions are the most evolved, and YSOs in bright-rimmed dust
pillars span a range of intermediate evolutionary stages. This rough
evolutionary sequence is substantiated by the presence of silicate absorption
features in the Spitzer IRS spectra of some YSOs in dark clouds and in
bright-rimmed dust pillars, but not those of YSOs in small H II regions. We
present a discussion on triggered star formation for YSOs in bright-rimmed dust
pillars or in dark clouds adjacent to H II regions. As many as 50% of the YSOs
are resolved into multiple sources in high-resolution HST images. This
illustrates the importance of using high-resolution images to probe the true

systems of interacting particles is a fundamental physical problem. We propose
a new nonuniform solid-state plasma system, produced by the optical injection
of current in two-dimensional semiconductor structures, where this control can
be achieved. Due to an injected current, the system symmetry is initially
broken. The subsequent nonequilibrium dynamics is governed by the spatially
varying long-range Coulomb forces and electron-hole collisions. As a result,
inhomogeneities in the charge and velocity distributions should develop
rapidly, and lead to previously unexpected experimental consequences. We
suggest that the system eventually evolves into a behavior similar to chaos.

identified by means of kinematic criteria. However, in many cases kinematic
criteria alone are insufficient to ascertain, whether an individual star is
really a member of this group. Since photometric criteria are ineffective in
the case of cool dwarf members, one must use spectroscopic criteria.
Nevertheless, resulting membership criteria are inconclusive. We reanalyse
spectroscopic properties of cool UMa group dwarfs. In particular, we study the
distribution of iron abundance, the strength of the Li I absorption at 6708 A
and the Li abundance, and the infilling of the core of the H alpha line.
Twenty-five cool and northern bona-fide members are carefully selected from the
literature. Homogeneously measured stellar parameters and iron abundances are
given for all Sun-like stars selected, based on spectra of high resolution and
high signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, we measure the Li equivalent width and
abundance as well as the relative intensity of the H alpha core and the
corresponding chromospheric flux. The studied stars infer an average Ursa Major
group iron abundance of -0.03+-0.05 dex, which is higher by about 0.06 dex than
determined elsewhere. The Li abundance derived of Ursa Major group dwarf stars
is higher than in the Hyades at effective temperatures cooler than the Sun, but
lower than in the younger Pleiades, a result which is independent of the exact
value of the effective temperature adopted. The Sun-like and cooler dwarfs also
display chromospheric infilling of the H alpha core. We present spectroscopic
criteria that may be used to exclude non-members.

determination of the 6Li/7Li isotopic ratio, q(Li)=n(6Li)/n(7Li), the intrinsic
asymmetry of the 7Li line must be taken into account, because its signature is
essentially indistinguishable from the presence of a weak 6Li blend in the red

ignored in the fitting of the lithium blend at 6707 A. Our conclusion is that

be expected by the standard theory. We address this puzzle with the model of
coupled radius-orbit tidal evolution developed by
\citet{Ibgui_and_Burrows_2009}. The planetary radius is evolved
self-consistently with orbital parameters, under the influence of tidal torques
and tidal dissipation in the interior of the planet. A general feature of this
model, which we have previously demonstrated in the generic case, is that a
possible transient inflation of the planetary radius can temporarily interrupt
its standard monotonic shrinking and can lead to the inflated radii that we
observe. In particular, a bloated planet with even a circular orbit may still
be inflated due to an earlier episode of tidal heating. We have modified our
model to include an orbital period dependence of the tidal dissipation factor
in the star, $Q'_{\ast} \propto P^{\gamma}$, $-1 \leqslant \gamma \leqslant 1$.
With this model, we search, for a tidally heated planet, orbital and radius
evolutionary tracks that fall within the observational limits of the radius,
the semimajor axis, and the eccentricity of the planet in its current estimated
age range. We find that, for some inflated planets (WASP-6b and WASP-15b),
there are such tracks; for another (TrES-4), there are none; and for still
others (WASP-4b and WASP-12b), there are such tracks, but our model might imply
that we are observing the planets at a special time. Finally, we stress that
there is a two to three order-of-magnitude timescale uncertainty of the
inspiraling phase of the planet into its host star, arising from uncertainties
in the tidal dissipation factor in the star $Q'_{\ast}$.

applications. However, most existing metric learning algorithms are limited to
learning metrics over low-dimensional data, while existing kernel learning
algorithms are often limited to the transductive setting and do not generalize
to new data points. In this paper, we study metric learning as a problem of
learning a linear transformation of the input data. We show that for
high-dimensional data, a particular framework for learning a linear
transformation of the data based on the LogDet divergence can be efficiently
kernelized to learn a metric (or equivalently, a kernel function) over an
arbitrarily high dimensional space. We further demonstrate that a wide class of
convex loss functions for learning linear transformations can similarly be
kernelized, thereby considerably expanding the potential applications of metric
learning. We demonstrate our learning approach by applying it to large-scale
real world problems in computer vision and text mining.

exhibits compressive strains, which are considerably greater than for concrete

thermal creep or load induced thermal strain and is usually modeled by
macroscopic phenomenological constitutive laws which have only limited
predictive capabilities. In the present study a meso-scale modeling approach is
proposed in which the macroscopically observed transient thermal creep results
from the mismatch of thermal expansions of the meso-scale constituents. The
meso-structure of concrete is idealized as a two-dimensional three phase
material consisting of aggregates, matrix and interfacial transition zones
(ITZ). The nonlinear material response of the phases are described by a
damage-plasticity interface model. The meso-scale approach was applied to
analyze compressed concrete specimens subjected to uniform temperature

using two different regularization schemes. The first is based on the shift i 0
to i varepsilon of the electron propagator pole in the complex energy plane,
and is used to explicitly calculate the effective field in the one-loop

self-energy can be consistently related to the pole shift, and that the
presence of the heat bath leads to appearance of an effective varepsilon sim T,
thus providing a natural infrared regulator of the theory. We find that the
one-loop effective Coulomb field calculated using this varepsilon vanishes. The
other scheme combines an infrared momentum cutoff with smearing of the
delta-functions in the interaction vertices. We prove that this regularization
admits factorization of the infrared contributions in multi-loop diagrams, and
sum the corresponding infinite series. The effective electromagnetic field is
found to vanish in this case too. An essentially perturbative nature of this

with Y perfect EPR pairs, where Y = NE +- O(\sqrt N). Our protocol is
streaming, so the N input systems are fed in one at a time, and perfect EPR
pairs start popping out almost immediately. It matches the optimal block
protocol exactly at each stage, so the average yield after n inputs is <Y> = nE
- O(log n). So, somewhat surprisingly, there is no tradeoff between yield and

presented, employing metal cooling and turbulent diffusion of metals and
thermal energy. An adiabatic feedback mechanism was adopted where gas cooling
was prevented to generate galactic winds without explicit wind particles. The
simulations produced a cosmic star formation history (SFH) that is broadly
consistent with observations until z $\sim$ 0.5, and a steady evolution of the
universal neutral hydrogen fraction ($\Omega_{\rm H I}$). At z=0, about 40% of
the baryons are in the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM), but most metals
(80%-90%) are locked in stars. At higher z the proportion of metals in the IGM
is higher due to more efficient loss from galaxies. The IGM metals primarily
reside in the WHIM throughout cosmic history. The metallicity evolution of the
gas inside galaxies is broadly consistent with observations, but the diffuse
IGM is under enriched at z $\sim$ 2.5. Galactic winds most efficiently enrich
the IGM for halos in the intermediate mass range $10^{10}$M$_{\sun}$ -
$10^{11}$ M$_{\sun}$. At the low mass end gas is prevented from accreting onto
halos and has very low metallicities. At the high mass end, the fraction of
halo baryons escaped as winds declines along with the decline of stellar mass
fraction of the galaxies. This is likely because of the decrease in star
formation activity and in wind escape efficiency. Metals enhance cooling which
allows WHIM gas to cool onto galaxies and increases star formation. Metal
diffusion allows winds to mix prior to escape, decreasing the IGM metal content
in favour of gas within galactic halos and star forming gas. Diffusion
significantly increases the amount of gas with low metallicities and changes
the density-metallicity relation.

from unitary. When the mass M' of the lightest right-handed neutrino is much
lighter than the masses of the others, we show that its decay asymmetries
within flavour-dependent leptogenesis can be expressed in terms of two
contributions, one depending on the unique dimension five (d=5) operator
generating neutrino masses and one depending on the dimension six (d=6)
operator associated with non-unitarity. In low-energy seesaw scenarios where
small lepton number violation explains the smallness of neutrino masses, the
lepton number conserving d=6 operator contribution generically dominates over
the d=5 operator contribution which results in a strong enhancement of the
flavour-dependent decay asymmetries without any resonance effects. To calculate
the produced final baryon asymmetry, the flavour equilibration effects directly
related to non-unitarity have to be taken into account. In a simple realization
of this non-unitarity driven leptogenesis, the lower bound on M' is found to be
about 10^8 GeV at the onset of the strong washout regime, more than one order
of magnitude below the bound in ""standard"" thermal leptogenesis.

predictions for the annihilation or decay rates of DM into stable particles of
the standard model. These predictions include usually only final states
accessible as lowest order tree-level processes, with electromagnetic
bremsstrahlung and the loop-suppressed two gamma-ray line as exceptions. We
show that this restriction may lead to severely biased results for DM tailored
to produce only leptons in final states and with mass in the TeV range. For
such models, unavoidable electroweak bremsstrahlung of Z and W-bosons has a
significant influence both on the branching ratio and the spectral shape of the
final state particles. We work out the consequences for two situations:
Firstly, the idealized case where DM annihilates at tree level with 100%
branching ratio into neutrinos. For a given cross section, this leads
eventually to ""minimal yields"" of photons, electrons, positrons and
antiprotons. Secondly, the case where the only allowed two-body final states
are electrons. The latter case is typical of models aimed at fitting cosmic ray
e^- and e^+ data. We find that the multimessenger signatures of such models can
be significantly modified with respect to results presented in the literature.

paper, mathematical models are use to investigate the dynamics of interpersonal

differential equations, in order to provide insight into the behaviors of love.
The analysis starts with a deterministic model and progresses to nonlinear
stochastic models capturing the stochastic rates and factors (e.g.: ecological
factors, such as historical, cultural and community conditions) that affect
proximal experiences and shape the patterns of relationship. Numerical examples
are given to illustrate various dynamics of interpersonal and romantic

between locally stable equilibria) that are observable in stochastic models
(closely related to real interpersonal dynamics), but absent in deterministic

Field Unit (IFU) observations of the [OIII] emission from a z~2 ultraluminous

Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). The spatial extent (~4-8 kpc) of the high

However, the estimated energy input required to produce the large-scale outflow
signatures (of order ~10^59 ergs over ~30 Myrs) could be delivered by a wind
radiatively driven by the AGN and/or supernovae winds from intense star
formation. The energy injection required to drive the outflow is comparable to
the estimated binding energy of the galaxy spheroid, suggesting that it can

turbulent structure of the extragalactic magnetic fields would produce a
stochastic behaviour in these conversions, leading to a statistical

that, in presence of ALP conversions, the photon transfer functions on
different lines of sight could have relevant deviations with respect to the

a surface tension and therefore a L\""uscher term, as expressed through an

to the background-field Feynman gauge, which will yield the gauge-invariant

pointed out already more than twenty five years ago, the colliders such as

Majorana mass through lepton number violating production of like sign lepton

then discuss in detail the situation in $L-R$ symmetric theories, which led
originally to the seesaw and which incorporates naturally both type I and type

the neutrino-less double beta decay, and its discovery at LHC would have
spectacular signatures of parity restoration and lepton number violation. At

form triclinic crystal structures when grown from solution, but the electronic
dispersion behavior is significantly different due to differences in
$\pi$-$\pi$ overlap along the $a$ crystal axis. Both systems display dispersion
of 0.40-0.45 eV in the valence band, suggesting a high intrinsic hole mobility.
However, the dispersion is primarily along the a-axis in the
silanyl-substituted derivative, but less aligned with this crystal axis in the
hexyl-substituted material. This is a direct consequence of the diferences in
co-facial $\pi$ electron overlap revealed by the crystallographic studies. We
find that photophysical defects, ascribed to excimer-like states, point to the
importance of localized trap states. Substituted pyrenes are useful model

  fields",,,,,"stat.ME stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We develop a weighted local likelihood estimate for the parameters that
govern the local spatial dependency of a locally stationary random field. The
advantage of this local likelihood estimate is that it smoothly downweights the
influence of far away observations, works for irregular sampling locations, and
when designed appropriately, can trade bias and variance for reducing
estimation error. This paper starts with an exposition of our technique on the
problem of estimating an unknown positive function when multiplied by a
stationary random field. This example gives concrete evidence of the benefits
of our local likelihood as compared to na\""ive local likelihoods where the
stationary model is assumed throughout a neighborhood. We then discuss the
difficult problem of estimating a bandwidth parameter that controls the amount
of influence from distant observations. Finally we present a simulation
experiment for estimating the local smoothness of a local Mat\'ern random field
when observing the field at random sampling locations in $[0,1]^2$.

distributions of rescaled durations of each type of cancelations exhibit a
scaling behavior for different stocks. Complex intraday patterns are also
unveiled in the inter-cancelation durations. The detrended fluctuation analysis

possess long-term memory and multifractal nature, which are not influenced by
the intraday patterns. No clear crossover phenomenon is observed in the
detrended fluctuation functions with respect to the time scale. These findings
indicate that the cancelation of limit orders is a non-Poisson process, which
has potential worth in the construction of order-driven market models.

unitary control and periodic projective measurements for the design of quantum
sliding mode control systems. Two examples including a two-level system and a

  Using a generalization of the Anderson-Putnam complex, O is identified with
the inverse limit of a sequence of finite CW-complexes. A Bratteli diagram B is
built from this sequence, and its set of infinite paths dB is homeomorphic to
X. The diagram B is endowed with a horizontal structure: additional edges that
encode the adjacencies of patches in T. This allows to define an etale
equivalence relation R_B on dB which is homeomorphic to R_X, and contains the
AF-relation of ""tail equivalence"".

quantization procedure in the Landau gauge. It is a very hard job to treat
these in the continuum, even in a partial manner. A decent way to do so was
worked out by Gribov, and later on by Zwanziger. The final point was a
renormalizable action (the Gribov-Zwanziger action), implementing the
restriction of the path integration to the so-called Gribov region, which is
free of a subset of gauge copies, but not of all copies. Till recently,
everybody agreed upon the fact that the restriction to the Gribov region
implied a infrared enhanced ghost, and vanishing zero momentum gluon
propagator. We discuss how the Gribov-Zwanziger action naturally leads to the
existence of vacuum condensates of dimension two. As it is very common, such
condensates can seriously alter the dynamics. In particular, the
Gribov-Zwanziger condensates give rise to a gluon propagator with a finite but
nonvanishing zero momentum limit, and reconstitute a nonenhanced ghost. We call
this the refined Gribov-Zwanziger framework. The predictions are in qualitative
agreement with most recent lattice simulations, and certain solutions of the
Schwinger-Dyson equations. A crucial feature of the Gribov-Zwanziger framework
is the soft (controllable) breaking of the BRST symmetry. We also point out
that imposing the Kugo-Ojima confinement criterion on the Faddeev-Popov theory
as a boundary condition from the beginning leads to the same partition function
as of Gribov-Zwanziger, with associated BRST symmetry breaking. This clouds the
interpretation of the Kugo-Ojima criterion in se.

Haynes Miller which proposes retractive transfer triples as a purely
homotopy-theoretic model for p-local finite groups. We take an important step
toward proving this conjecture by showing that a retractive transfer triple
gives rise to a p-local finite group when two technical assumptions are made,
thus reducing the conjecture to proving those two assumptions.

  of the 42th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC 2010)",,,,"cs.DS cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We revisit the well-known problem of sorting under partial information: sort
a finite set given the outcomes of comparisons between some pairs of elements.
The input is a partially ordered set P, and solving the problem amounts to
discovering an unknown linear extension of P, using pairwise comparisons. The
information-theoretic lower bound on the number of comparisons needed in the
worst case is log e(P), the binary logarithm of the number of linear extensions
of P. In a breakthrough paper, Jeff Kahn and Jeong Han Kim (J. Comput. System
Sci. 51 (3), 390-399, 1995) showed that there exists a polynomial-time
algorithm for the problem achieving this bound up to a constant factor. Their
algorithm invokes the ellipsoid algorithm at each iteration for determining the
next comparison, making it impractical.
  We develop efficient algorithms for sorting under partial information. Like
Kahn and Kim, our approach relies on graph entropy. However, our algorithms
differ in essential ways from theirs. Rather than resorting to convex
programming for computing the entropy, we approximate the entropy, or make sure
it is computed only once, in a restricted class of graphs, permitting the use
of a simpler algorithm. Specifically, we present:
  - an O(n^2) algorithm performing O(log n log e(P)) comparisons;
  - an O(n^2.5) algorithm performing at most (1+ epsilon) log e(P) + O_epsilon
(n) comparisons;
  - an O(n^2.5) algorithm performing O(log e(P)) comparisons.
  All our algorithms can be implemented in such a way that their computational
bottleneck is confined in a preprocessing phase, while the sorting phase is
completed in O(q) + O(n) time, where q denotes the number of comparisons
performed.

destination, an eavesdropper and a jammer relay is studied. The jammer relay
does not hear the source transmission. It assists the eavesdropper and aims to
decrease the achievable secrecy rates. The source, on the other hand, aims to
increase the achievable secrecy rates. Assuming Gaussian strategies at the
source and the jammer relay, this problem is formulated as a two-player
zero-sum continuous game, where the payoff is the achieved secrecy rate. For
this game the Nash Equilibrium is generally achieved with mixed strategies. The
optimal cumulative distribution functions for the source and the jammer relay
that achieve the value of the game, which is the equilibrium secrecy rate, are
found.
