presence of large self-fields. Simplifications are known to arise when these
fields are split into two parts in the so-called Detweiler-Whiting
decomposition. One component satisfies vacuum field equations, while the other
does not. The force and torque exerted by the (often ignored) inhomogeneous

spacetimes. If the geometry is sufficiently smooth, it is found to introduce
effective shifts in all multipole moments of the body's stress-energy tensor.
This greatly expands the validity of statements that the homogeneous R field
determines the self-force and self-torque up to renormalization effects. The
forces and torques exerted by the S field directly measure the degree to which
a spacetime fails to admit Killing vectors inside the body. A number of
mathematical results related to the use of generalized Killing fields are
therefore derived, and may be of wider interest. As an example of their
application, the effective shift in the quadrupole moment of a charge's

  First, we show that there exists an oracle relation problem (i.e., a problem
with many valid outputs) that is solvable in BQP, but not in PH. This also
yields a non-oracle relation problem that is solvable in quantum logarithmic
time, but not in AC0.

follow from the Generalized Linial-Nisan Conjecture, which we formulate here

differential form on X, that is, omega can be written in local coordinates as
f(z) dz^2, for some meromorphic function f. We say that a curve gamma is part
of a horizontal leaf of omega if for each t in I, we have that f(gamma(t))
(gamma'(t))^2 is real and positive. The differential omega is said to be a
Strebel differential if its noncompact horizontal leaves form a set of measure
0.
  Now, most quadratic differential forms on any given Riemann surface are not
Strebel (in fact, the space of Strebel differentials on the projective line as
a subset of the space of all quadratic differentials on the projective line is
a countable union of real lines in the complex plane. Because of this, this
paper focuses on writing down explicit examples of Strebel differentials.
  Most papers that discuss Strebel differentials seem to focus on those that
have only second order poles, since they define a cellular decomposition on X.
However, we construct an explicit family of examples of holomorphic Strebel
differentials on any hyperelliptic curve branched over the points 0, 1,
infinity, and 1/2 + ir, for any real r.
  Later, we look at an example from a previous paper, where omega was an
algebraic Strebel differential such that omega had integral residues, on a
Riemann surface X defined over the algebraic closure of the rationals that had
a transcendental period. We then modify this example to obtain another
algebraic Strebel differential omega', defined on an algebraic Riemann surface
X', all of whose periods are transcendental.

that considers comet dust as a mixture of aggregates and compact particles. The
model is based on the Giotto and Stardust mission findings that both aggregates
(made mainly of organics, silicates, and carbon) and solid silicate particles
are present in the comet dust. We simulate aggregates as {\bf Ballistic
Cluster-Cluster Aggregates (BCCA)} and compact particles as polydisperse

power-law size distribution with the power -3 that is close to the one obtained
for comet dust {\it in situ}, at studies of the Stardust returned samples, and
the results of ground-based observations of comets. The model provides a good
fit to the angular polarization curve. It also reproduces the positive spectral
gradient of polarization, red color of the dust, and {\bf low albedo. It also
has the ratio of compact to fluffy particles close to the one found {\it in

produce emission maps of the magnetosphere above the polar caps for each pulsar

complex, even when the profile appears simple. For three pulsars, we can derive
emission heights and polar maps which are consistent with emission regions

the inequivalence of certain quantum field theories on noncommutative
spacetimes constructed using twisted fields. The issue is of physical
importance. Thus it is well known that the commutation relations among
spacetime coordinates, which define a noncommutative spacetime, do not
constrain the deformation induced on the algebra of functions uniquely. Such
deformations are all mathematically equivalent in a very precise sense. Here we
show how this freedom at the level of deformations of the algebra of functions
can fail on the quantum field theory side. In particular, quantum field theory
on the Wick-Voros and Moyal planes are shown to be inequivalent in a few
different ways. Thus quantum field theory calculations on these planes will
lead to different physics even though the classical theories are equivalent.
This result is reminiscent of chiral anomaly in gauge theories and has obvious
physical consequences. The construction of quantum field theories on the
Wick-Voros plane has new features not encountered for quantum field theories on
the Moyal plane. In fact it seems impossible to construct a quantum field
theory on the Wick-Voros plane which satisfies all the properties needed of
field theories on noncommutative spaces. The Moyal twist seems to have unique
features which make it a preferred choice for the construction of a quantum
field theory on a noncommutative spacetime.

is focused on polyominoes with hexagonal cells. Concretely, we deal with
polyominoes whose columns can have either one or two connected components.
Those polyominoes (unlike the well-explored column-convex polyominoes) cannot
be exactly enumerated by any of the now existing methods. It is therefore
appropriate to introduce additional restrictions, thus obtaining solvable
subclasses. In our recent paper, published in this same journal, the
restrictions just mentioned were semidirectedness and an upper bound on the
size of the gap within a column. In this paper, the semidirectedness
requirement is made looser. The result is that now the exactly solved

in the Kuiper belt. Orcus is amongst the largest objects known in the Kuiper
belt, but the relative size of Vanth is much larger than that of the tiny
satellites of the other large objects. From Hubble Space Telescope observations
we find that Orcus and Vanth have different visible colors and that Vanth does
not share the water ice absorption feature seen in the infrared spectrum of
Orcus. We also find that Vanth has a nearly face-on circular orbit with a
period of 9.5393 +-0.0001 days and semimajor axis of 8980+-20 km, implying a
system mass of 6.32+- 0.01 X 10^20 kg or 3.8% the mass of dwarf planet Eris.
  From Spitzer Space Telescope observations we find that the thermal emission
is consistent with a single body with diameter 940+-70 km and a geometric
albedo of 0.28+-0.04. Assuming equal densities and albedos, this measurements
implies sizes of Orcus and Vanth of 900 and 280 km, respectively, and a mass
ratio of 33. Assuming a factor of 2 lower albedo for the non-icy Vanth,
however, implies sizes of 820 and 640 km and a mass ratio of 2. The measured
density depends on the assumed albedo ratio of the two objects but is
approximately 1.5+-0.3 g cm^-3$, midway between typical densities measured for
larger and for smaller objects. The orbit and mass ratio is consistent with
formation from a giant impact and subsequent outward tidal evolution and even
consistent with the system having now achieved a double synchronous state. The
system can equally well be explained, however, by initial eccentric capture,
Kozai cycling which increases the eccentricity and decreases the pericenter of
the orbit of Vanth, and subsequent tidal evolution inward.

polyominoes was introduced and its area generating function was found. That
generating function is rational: the numerator has degree four and the
denominator has degree three. Let a column-duplex polyomino be a polyomino
whose columns can have either one or two connected components. A simplex-duplex
polyomino is a column-duplex polyomino in which there is no occurrence of two
adjacent columns each having two connected components. Simplex-duplex
polyominoes are not easy to deal with, but their area generating function can
still be found. To find this generating function, we use an upgraded version of
the Temperley method. Though that technique is widely used in these times, our
application presents two interesting features. Firstly, we add one or two
columns at a time, thus bypassing those simplex-duplex polyominoes which end
with a two-component column. (It is somewhat more usual to add just one column
at a time.) Secondly, we obtain a functional equation that involves both the
first and the second derivatives of the sought-for generating function. (Such
equations usually involve the first derivative only. In some cases, no
derivative is involved at all.) Right because of this latter interesting
feature, the Temperley method produces a very complicated formula for the
generating function. Anyway, from that formula it is easy to compute Taylor
polynomials. Thus we get plenty of evidence that the number of n-celled
simplex-duplex polyominoes behaves asymptotically as 0.119443*3.522020^n. For
comparison, the number of n-celled column-convex polyominoes behaves
asymptotically as 0.180916*3.205569^n.

symbols. The palace of Knossos was amply decorated with these symbols. The
rituals performed in Knossos and other Minoan palaces included the alteration
of light and darkness, as well as the use of reflection. The Minoan primary
goddess was a solar goddess, the 'Minoan Demeter'. A Late Minoan clay disk has
been identified as a ritual calendrical object showing the most important
celestial cycles, especially the lunar octaeteris. The disk, as well as the
Minoan stone kernoi, were probably used in relation to the Minoan festival
calendar. The orientations of the central courts of the palaces of Knossos,
Phaistos, Mallia and Gournia were to the rising sun, whereas the Eastern
palaces Zakros and Petras were oriented to the southernmost and the
northernmost risings of the moon, respectively. The E-W axes of the courts of
Knossos and Phaistos were oriented to the sunrise five days before the vernal
equinox. This orientation is related to the five epagomenal days in the end of
a year, which was probably the time of a Minoan festival. One of the
orientations of the Knossian Throne Room is towards the heliacal rising of
Spica in 2000-1000 BCE. Spica rose heliacally at the time of vintage in Minoan
times. The time near the date of the heliacal rising of Spica was the time of
an important festival related to ctchonic deities, the Minoan predecessor of
the Eleusinian Mysteries. The myths of Minos, Demeter and Persephone probably
have an astronomical origin, related to Minoan observations of the periods of
the moon, Venus and Spica. These celestial events were related to the idea of
renewal, which was central in the Minoan religion.

dispersions in the Milky Way's classical dwarf ellipticals, for reasonable
values of the stellar mass-to-light ratio of the galaxies; two discrepantly
high mass-to-light ratios may be explained by tidal effects. Recent
observations also show MOND describes tidal dwarf galaxies, which form in
complex dynamical environments. The application of MOND to galaxy clusters,
where it fails to reproduce observed gas temperatures, is also reviewed.
Relativistic theories containing MOND in the non-relativistic limit have now
been formulated; they all contain new dynamical fields, which may serve as
additional sources of gravitation that could reconcile cluster observations
with MOND. Certain limits of these theories can also give the accelerating
expansion of the Universe. The standard dark matter cosmology boasts numerous
manifest triumphs; however, alternatives should also be pursued as long as
outstanding observational issues remain unresolved, including the empirical
successes of MOND on galaxy scales and the phenomenology of dark energy.

especial class of integrals. It contains double integrals in the position space
in d = 4-2e dimensions, where e is parameter of dimensional regularization.
These integrals contribute to the effective action of the N = 4 supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theory. The integrand is a fraction in which the numerator is a
logarithm of ratio of spacetime intervals, and the denominator is the product
of powers of spacetime intervals. According to the method developed in the
previous papers, in order to make use of the uniqueness technique for one of
two integrations, we shift exponents in powers in the denominator of integrands
by some multiples of e. As the next step, the second integration in the
position space is done by Mellin-Barnes transform. For normalizing procedure,
we reproduce first the known result obtained earlier by Gegenbauer polynomial
technique. Then, we make another shift of exponents in powers in the
denominator to create the logarithm in the numerator as the derivative with
respect to the shift parameter delta. We show that the technique of work with
the contour of the integral modified in this way by using Mellin-Barnes
transform repeats the technique of work with the contour of the integral
without such a modification. In particular, all the operations with a shift of
contour of integration over complex variables of two-fold Mellin-Barnes
transform are the same as before the delta modification of indices, and even
the poles of residues coincide. This confirms the observation made in the
previous papers that in the position space all the Green function of N = 4
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory can be expressed in terms of UD functions.

light curves. We have also been able to estimate the distance modulus of the

between the Fourier parameters and some physical parameters of these variables

have novel structures such that they are inverted-bell shaped and the supports
of them are bounded. In the present paper we claim that these properties of the
SQW$^{(d)}$ can be explained by the theory of relativistic quantum mechanics.
We show that the Dirac equation with a proper ultraviolet cutoff can provide a
quantum walk model in three dimensions, where the walker has a four-component
qubit. We clarify that the pseudovelocity $\V(t)$ of the quantum walker, which
solves the Dirac equation, is identified with the relativistic velocity. Since
the quantum walker should be a tardyon, not a tachyon, $|\V(t)| < c$, where $c$
is the speed of light, and this restriction (the causality) is the origin of
the finiteness of supports of the limit distributions universally found in
quantum walk models. By reducing the number of components of momentum in the
Dirac equation, we obtain the limit distributions of pseudovelocities for the
lower dimensional quantum walks. We show that the obtained limit distributions
for the one- and two-dimensional systems have the common features with those of
SQW$^{(1)}$ and SQW$^{(2)}$.

the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism and numerically solve the

the transient regime we find that the current initially flows simultaneously
into both of the leads and then afterwards oscillates between flowing into and
out of the leads. At later times the oscillations decay away and the current
settles into flowing from the hotter to the colder lead. We find the transient

two temperature accreting flow to a cooling dominated phase and vice versa
around black holes. Based on a global sub-Keplerian accretion disc model in
steady state, including explicit cooling processes self-consistently, we show
that general advective accretion flow passes through various phases during its
infall towards a black hole. Bremsstrahlung, synchrotron and inverse
Comptonization of soft photons are considered as possible cooling mechanisms.
Hence the flow governs a much lower electron temperature ~10^8 - 10^{9.5}K
compared to the hot protons of temperature ~10^{10.2} - 10^{11.8}K in the range
of the accretion rate in Eddington units 0.01 - 100. Therefore, the solutions
may potentially explain the hard X-rays and the gamma-rays emitted from AGNs
and X-ray binaries. We finally compare the solutions for two different regimes
of viscosity and conclude that a weakly viscous flow is expected to be cooling
dominated compared to its highly viscous counterpart which is radiatively
inefficient. The flow is successfully able to reproduce the observed
luminosities of the under-fed AGNs and quasars (e.g. Sgr A*), ultra-luminous
X-ray sources (e.g. SS433), as well as the highly luminous AGNs and
ultra-luminous quasars (e.g. PKS 0743-67) at different combinations of the mass

insulator. Superconductivity exists at half-filling just at the border of the
Mott transition and extends away from half-filling into a whole region till a
critical doping, beyond which it gives way to a normal metal phase. This result
suggests that superconductivity should be unavoidably met by liquefying a

the 'conjugate gradient' method to determine $E_1$ in each disordered sample

t_{eq}(N) \sim N^{\psi}$ with $\psi=1/3$ in agreement with most previous

unreliable with possible deviations of up to 100 m/s within one order range,
while delivering an overall 1 m/s accuracy (Wilken et al 2009). Such deviation
corresponds to delta alpha/alpha ~ 7E-6 for a FeII-MgII pair. Comparison of
line shifts among the 5 FeII lines, with almost identical sensitivity to fine
structure constant changes, offers a clean way to directly test the presence of
possible local wavelength calibration errors of whatever origin. We analyzed 5
absorption systems, with zabs ranging from 1.15 to 2.19 towards 3 bright QSOs.
The results show that while some lines are aligned within 20 m/s, others reveal
large deviations reaching 200 m/s or higher and corresponding to a delta
alpha/alpha > 1E-5 level. The origin of these deviations is not clearly
identified but could be related to the adaptation of wavelength calibration to
CCD manufacturing irregularities. These results suggest that to draw
conclusions from delta alpha/alpha analysis based on one or only few lines must
be done with extreme care.

nonlinearity coefficient $\Gamma$ with a discontinuity supports stationary
localized solitary waves with frequencies inside spectral gaps, so called
surface gap solitons (SGSs). We compute families of 1D SGSs using the arclength
continuation method for a range of values of the jump in $\Gamma$. Using
asymptotics, we show that when the frequency parameter converges to the
bifurcation gap edge, the size of the allowed jump in $\Gamma$ converges to 0
for SGSs centered at any $x_c\in \R$.
  Linear stability of SGSs is next determined via the numerical Evans function
method, in which the stable and unstable manifolds corresponding to the 0
solution of the linearized spectral ODE problem need to be evolved. Zeros of
the Evans function coincide with eigenvalues of the linearized operator. Far
from the SGS center the manifolds are spanned by exponentially
decaying/increasing Bloch functions. Evolution of the manifolds suffers from
stiffness but a numerically stable formulation is possible in the exterior
algebra formulation and with the use of Grassmanian preserving ODE integrators.
Eigenvalues with positive real part above a small constant are then detected
using the complex argument principle and a contour parallel to the imaginary
axis. The location of real eigenvalues is found via a straightforward
evaluation of the Evans function along the real axis and several complex
eigenvalues are located using M\""{u}ller's method. The numerical Evans function
method is described in detail. Our results show the existence of both unstable
and stable SGSs (possibly with a weak instability), where stability is obtained
even for some SGSs centered in the domain half with the less focusing
nonlinearity. Direct simulations of the PDE for selected SGS examples confirm
the results of Evans function computations.

found that the lateral distributions of the electric field strengths in
individual EAS can be described by an exponential function. For about 20% of
the events a flattening towards the shower axis is observed, preferentially for
showers with large inclination angle. The estimated scale parameters R0
describing the slope of the lateral profiles range between 100 and 200 m. No
evidence for a direct correlation of R0 with shower parameters like azimuth
angle, geomagnetic angle, or primary energy can be found. This indicates that
the lateral profile is an intrinsic property of the radio emission during the

an extrasolar planetary system with one of the shortest orbital periods known.
Through the use of telescope defocussing we achieve a photometric precision of
0.47 to 0.83 mmag per observation over complete transit events. The data are
analysed using the JKTEBOP code and three different sets of stellar
evolutionary models. We find the mass and radius of the planet to be M_b =
10.43 +/- 0.30 +/- 0.24 Mjup R_b = 1.165 +/- 0.055 +/- 0.014 Rjup (statistical
and systematic errors) respectively. The systematic errors in the orbital
separation and the stellar and planetary masses, arising from the use of
theoretical predictions, are of a similar size to the statistical errors and
set a limit on our understanding of the WASP-18 system. We point out that seven
of the nine known massive transiting planets (M_b > 3 Mjup) have eccentric
orbits, whereas significant orbital eccentricity has been detected for only
four of the 46 less massive planets. This may indicate that there are two
different populations of transiting planets, but could also be explained by
observational biases. Further radial velocity observations of low-mass planets
will make it possible to choose between these two scenarios.

fractal cosmology whose main aim is to model the observed inhomogeneities of
the distribution of galaxies by means of the Lemaitre-Tolman solution of
Einstein's field equations for spherically symmetric dust in comoving
coordinates. This model is based on earlier works developed by L. Pietronero
and J.R. Wertz on Newtonian cosmology, whose main points are discussed.
Observational relations in this spacetime are presented, together with a
strategy for finding numerical solutions which approximate an averaged and
smoothed out single fractal structure in the past light cone. Such fractal
solutions are shown, with one of them being in agreement with some basic
observational constraints, including the decay of the average density with the
distance as a power law (the de Vaucouleurs' density power law) and the fractal
dimension in the range 1 <= D <= 2. The spatially homogeneous Friedmann model
is discussed as a special case of the Lemaitre-Tolman solution, and it is found
that once we apply the observational relations developed for the fractal model
we find that all Friedmann models look inhomogeneous along the backward null
cone, with a departure from the observable homogeneous region at relatively
close ranges. It is also shown that with these same observational relations the
Einstein-de Sitter model can have an interpretation where it has zero global
density, a result consistent with the ""zero global density postulate"" advanced
by Wertz for hierarchical cosmologies and conjectured by Pietronero for fractal
cosmological models. The article ends with a brief discussion on the possible
link between this model and nonlinear and chaotic dynamics.

during the first half of December 2007. This campaign involved AGILE, Spitzer,
Swift,Suzaku,the WEBT consortium,the REM and MITSuME telescopes,offering a
broad band coverage that allowed for a simultaneous sampling of the synchrotron
and inverse Compton (IC) emissions.The 2-week AGILE monitoring was accompanied
by radio to optical monitoring by WEBT and REM and by sparse observations in
mid-Infrared and soft/hard X-ray energy bands performed by means of Target of
Opportunity observations by Spitzer, Swift and Suzaku, respectively.The source
was detected with an average flux of~250x10^{-8}ph cm^-2s^-1 above 100
MeV,typical of its flaring states.The simultaneous optical and gamma-ray
monitoring allowed us to study the time-lag associated with the variability in
the two energy bands, resulting in a possible ~1-day delay of the gamma-ray
emission with respect to the optical one. From the simultaneous optical and
gamma-ray fast flare detected on December 12, we can constrain the delay
between the gamma-ray and optical emissions within 12 hours. Moreover, we
obtain three Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) with simultaneous data for
2007 December 5, 13, 15, characterized by the widest multifrequency coverage.
We found that a model with an external Compton on seed photons by a standard
disk and reprocessed by the Broad Line Regions does not describe in a
satisfactory way the SEDs of 2007 December 5, 13 and 15. An additional
contribution, possibly from the hot corona with T=10^6 K surrounding the jet,
is required to account simultaneously for the softness of the synchrotron and
the hardness of the inverse Compton emissions during those epochs.

One of our main goals is to understand whether, as claimed by some, the cool
core/non-cool core division is established once and for all during the early
history of a cluster.
  Methods. We employ a sample of about 60 objects to classify clusters
according to different properties: we characterize cluster cores in terms of
their thermo-dynamic and chemical properties and clusters as a whole in terms
of their dynamical properties.
  Results. We find that: I) the vast majority of merging systems feature high
entropy cores (HEC); II) objects with lower entropy cores feature more
pronounced metallicity peaks than objects with higher entropy cores. We
identify a small number of medium (MEC) and high (HEC) entropy core systems
which, unlike most other such objects, feature a large central metallicity. The
majority of these outliers are mergers, i.e. systems far from their equilibrium
configuration.
  Conclusions. We surmise that medium (MEC) and high (HEC) entropy core systems
with a large central metallicity recently evolved from low entropy core (LEC)
clusters that have experienced a heating event associated to AGN or merger
activity.

independent silicon strip detectors, equipped with one-dimensional coded masks,
operating in the nominal energy range 18-60 keV. The main goal of SuperAGILE is
the observation of cosmic sources simultaneously with the main gamma-ray AGILE
experiment, the Gamma Ray Imaging Detector (GRID). Given its
$\sim$steradian-wide field of view and its $\sim$15 mCrab day-sensitivity,
SuperAGILE is also well suited for the long-term monitoring of Galactic compact
objects and the detection of bright transients. The SuperAGILE detector
properties and design allow for a 6 arcmin angular resolution in each of the
two independent orthogonal projections of the celestial coordinates. Photon by
photon data are continuously available by the experiment telemetry, and are
used to derive images and fluxes of individual sources, with integration times
depending on the source intensity and position in the field of view. In this
paper we report on the main scientific results achieved by SuperAGILE over its
first two years in orbit, until April 2009.

equivalent to MHV scattering amplitudes in N=4 super Yang-Mills. We compute
such Wilson loops for special polygonal contours at two loops in perturbation
theory. Specifically, we concentrate on the remainder function R, obtained by
subtracting the known ABDK/BDS ansatz from the Wilson loop. First, we consider
a particular two-dimensional eight-point kinematics studied at strong coupling
by Alday and Maldacena. We find numerical evidence that R is the same at weak
and at strong coupling, up to an overall, coupling-dependent constant. This
suggests a universality of the remainder function at strong and weak coupling
for generic null polygonal Wilson loops, and therefore for arbitrary MHV
amplitudes in N=4 super Yang-Mills. We analyse the consequences of this
statement. We further consider regular n-gons, and find that the remainder
function is linear in n at large n through numerical computations performed up
to n=30. This reproduces a general feature of the corresponding strong-coupling

defends the body from foreign pathogens. It is able to categorize all cells (or

the help of a distributed task force that has the intelligence to take action
from a local and also a global perspective using its network of chemical
messengers for communication. There are two major branches of the immune
system. The innate immune system is an unchanging mechanism that detects and
destroys certain invading organisms, whilst the adaptive immune system responds
to previously unknown foreign cells and builds a response to them that can
remain in the body over a long period of time. This remarkable information
processing biological system has caught the attention of computer science in
recent years. A novel computational intelligence technique, inspired by
immunology, has emerged, called Artificial Immune Systems. Several concepts
from the immune have been extracted and applied for solution to real world
science and engineering problems. In this tutorial, we briefly describe the
immune system metaphors that are relevant to existing Artificial Immune Systems
methods. We will then show illustrative real-world problems suitable for
Artificial Immune Systems and give a step-by-step algorithm walkthrough for one

of their central regions. Recent results have shown that the cluster population
is bimodal (Cavagnolo et al. 2009). We want to understand whether the observed
distribution of clusters is due to a primordial division into two distinct
classes rather than to differences in how these systems evolve across cosmic
time. We systematically search the ICM of NCC clusters in a subsample of the
B55 flux limited sample of clusters for regions which have some characteristics
typical of cool cores, namely low entropy gas and high metal abundance We find
that most NCC clusters in our sample host regions reminiscent of CC, i. e.
characterized by relative low entropy gas (albeit not as low as in CC systems)
and a metal abundance excess. We have dubbed these structures ""cool core
remnants"", since we interpret them as what remains of a cool core after a
heating event (AGN giant outbursts in a few cases and more commonly mergers).
We infer that most NCC clusters have undergone a cool core phase during their
life. The fact that most cool core remnants are found in dynamically active
objects provides strong support to scenarios where cluster core properties are
not fixed ""ab initio"" but evolve across cosmic time.

cosmic X-ray background (CXB). For AGN population synthesis models to replicate
the peak region of the CXB (~30 keV), a highly obscured and therefore nearly
invisible class of AGN, known as Compton thick (CT) AGN, must be assumed to
contribute nearly a third of the CXB. In order to constrain the CT fraction of
AGN and the CT number density we consider several hard X-ray AGN luminosity
functions and the contribution of blazars to the CXB. Following the unified
scheme, the radio AGN luminosity function is relativistically beamed to create
a radio blazar luminosity function. An average blazar spectral energy density
model is created to transform radio luminosity to X-ray luminosity. We find the
blazar contribution to the CXB to be 12% in the 0.5-2 keV band, 7.4% in the
2-10 keV band, 8.9% in the 15-55 keV band, and 100% in the MeV region. When
blazars are included in CXB synthesis models, CT AGN are predicted to be
roughly one-third of obscured AGN, in contrast to the prediction of one half if
blazars are not considered. Our model implies a BL Lac X-ray duty cycle of
~13%, consistent with the concept of intermittent jet activity in low power
radio galaxies.

exciting topics in observational cosmology. The determination of the best
possible observing strategies is a very important choice in order to build up a
representative sample of spectroscopically confirmed sources at high-z (z>7),
beyond the limits of present-day observations. This paper is intended to
precisely adress the relative efficiency of lensing and blank fields in the
identification and study of galaxies at 6<z<12. The detection efficiency and
field-to-field variance are estimated from direct simulations of both blank and
lensing fields observations. The presence of a strong-lensing cluster along the
line of sight has a dramatic effect on the number of observed sources, with a
positive magnification bias in typical ground-based ``shallow'' surveys
(AB<~25.5). The positive magnification bias increases with the redshift of
sources and decreases with both depth of the survey and the size of the
surveyed area. The maximum efficiency is reached for lensing clusters at
z~0.1-0.3. Observing blank fields in shallow surveys is particularly
inefficient as compared to lensing fields if the UV LF for LBGs is strongly
evolving at z>~7. Also in this case, the number of z>8 sources expected at the
typical depth of JWST (AB~28-29) is much higher in lensing than in blank fields
(e.g. a factor of ~10 for AB<~28). Blank field surveys with a large field of
view are needed to prove the bright end of the LF at z>6-7, whereas lensing
clusters are particularly useful for exploring the mid to faint end of the LF.
