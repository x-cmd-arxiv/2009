remote location without actually transmitting the state itself. Using at most
two classical bits and a single shared maximally entangled state, one can in
theory remotely prepare any qubit state with certainty and with perfect
fidelity. However, in any experimental implementation the average fidelity
between the target and output states cannot be perfect. In order for an RSP
experiment to demonstrate genuine quantum advantages, it must surpass the
optimal threshold of a comparable classical protocol. Here we study the
fidelity achievable by RSP protocols lacking shared entanglement, and determine
the optimal value for the average fidelity in several different cases. We
implement an experimental scheme for deterministic remote preparation of
arbitrary photon polarization qubits, preparing 178 different pure and mixed
qubit states with an average fidelity of 0.995. Our experimentally-achieved
average fidelities surpass our derived classical thresholds whenever the
classical protocol does not trivially allow for perfect RSP.

leading to explicit CP violation in the model, while the Yukawa couplings and
the vacuum expectation of the scalar fields remain real. The tri-bimaximal

to the prediction for theta_{13} ~ theta_{c}/(3 sqrt{2}), the model gives rise
to a sum rule, tan^2 theta_{sol} ~ \tan^2 theta_{sol,TBM} + (1/2) theta_{c}
cos(delta), which is a consequence of the Georgi-Jarlskog relations in the

Careful attention to the Lorentz structure has also profound implications for
the structure of the transverse momentum dependent parton densities often used

observe a number of new phenomena for the conformal and CTS methods. Within
this family, we obtain a general existence theorem so long as the mean
curvature does not change sign. When the mean curvature changes sign, we find
that for certain data solutions exist if and only if the transverse-traceless
tensor is sufficiently small. When such solutions exist, there are generically
more than one. Moreover, the theory for mean curvatures changing sign is shown
to be extremely sensitive with respect to the value of a coupling constant in

bound technique for the communication complexity of such problems is that of
partition arguments: partition the k players into two disjoint sets of players
and find a lower bound for the induced two-party communication complexity
problem.
  In this paper, we study the power of partition arguments. Our two main
results are very different in nature: (i) For randomized communication
complexity, we show that partition arguments may yield bounds that are
exponentially far from the true communication complexity. Specifically, we
prove that there exists a 3-argument function f whose communication complexity
is Omega(n), while partition arguments can only yield an Omega(log n) lower
bound. The same holds for nondeterministic communication complexity. (ii) For
deterministic communication complexity, we prove that finding significant gaps
between the true communication complexity and the best lower bound that can be
obtained via partition arguments, would imply progress on a generalized version

elliptical magnetic dots the analysis was made for variable thickness and
length of major axis, keeping a 2:1 axis ratio. From the simulations, a phase
diagram was constructed, where the ground state configurations of the nanodots
are represented in a diagram of nanodot height versus length of the major axis

two vortices; it is similar, but more complex than that derived using a

distinct groups: one group of compact, tidally-underfilling clusters with
r_h/r_J<0.05 and another group of tidally filling clusters which have 0.1 <
r_h/r_J<0.3. We find no correlation between the membership of a particular
cluster to one of these groups and its membership in the old or younger halo

that compact clusters and most clusters in the inner Milky Way were born
compact with half-mass radii r_h < 1 pc. Some of the tidally-filling clusters
might have formed compact as well, but the majority likely formed with large
half-mass radii. Galactic globular clusters therefore show a similar dichotomy
as was recently found for globular clusters in dwarf galaxies and for young

recently discovered by Kuepper et al. (2008) and are in the process of

of gravitational waves, that can impart a substantial recoil to the merged

black hole is surrounded by a thin circumbinary disc. Our results differ
significantly from those of previous investigations. We show analytically that
the dominant source of energy is often potential energy, released as gas in the
outer disc attempts to circularize at smaller radii. Thus, dimensional
estimates, that include only the kinetic energy gained by the disc gas,
underestimate the real energy loss. This underestimate can exceed an order of
magnitude, if the recoil is directed close to the disc plane. We use three
dimensional Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations and two dimensional
finite difference simulations to verify our analytic estimates. We also compute
the bolometric light curve, which is found to vary strongly depending upon the
kick angle. A prompt emission signature due to this mechanism may be observable
for low mass (10^6 Solar mass) black holes whose recoil velocities exceed about
1000 km/s. Emission at earlier times can mainly result from the response of the
disc to the loss of mass, as the black holes merge. We derive analytically the

field is reconstructed using the current sample of ~8500 accurate zCOSMOS
redshifts at I(AB)<22.5 out to z~1 on scales R from 8 to 12 Mpc/h. By comparing
the probability distribution function (PDF) of galaxy density contrast delta_g
to the lognormal approximation of the PDF of the mass density contrast delta,
we obtain the mean biasing function b(delta,z,R) between the galaxy and matter
overdensity field and its second moments b(hat) and b(tilde) up to z~1. Over
the redshift interval 0.4<z<1 the conditional mean function <delta_g|delta> =
b(delta,z,R) delta is of the following characteristic shape. The function
vanishes in the most underdense regions and then sharply rises in a nonlinear
way towards the mean densities. <delta_g|delta> is almost a linear tracer of
the matter in the overdense regions, up to the most overdense regions in which
it is nonlinear again and the local effective slope of <delta_g|delta> vs.
delta is smaller than unity. The <delta_g|delta> function is evolving only
slightly over the redshift interval 0.4<z<1. The linear biasing parameter
increases from b(hat)=1.24+/-0.11 at z=0.4 to b(hat)=1.64+/-0.15 at z=1 for the
M_B<-20-z sample of galaxies. b(hat) does not show any dependence on the
smoothing scale from 8 to 12 Mpc/h, but increases with luminosity. The measured
nonlinearity parameter b(tilde)/b(hat) is of the order of a few percent (but it
can be consistent with 0) and it does not change with redshift, the smoothing
scale or the luminosity. By matching the linear bias of galaxies to the halo
bias, we infer that the M_B<-20-z galaxies reside in dark matter haloes with a
characteristic mass of about 3-6 x 10^12 Msol, depending on the halo bias fit.

combined with WMAP5 constraints, these low-redshift measurements constrain sum
mnu<0.4 eV at the 95% confidence level. This bound does not relax when allowing
for the running of the spectral index or for primordial tensor perturbations.
When adding also Supernovae and BAO constraints, we obtain a 95% upper limit of
sum mnu<0.3 eV. We test the sensitivity of the neutrino mass constraint to the
assumed expansion history by both allowing a dark energy equation of state
parameter w to vary, and by studying a model with coupling between dark energy
and dark matter, which allows for variation in w, Omegak, and dark coupling
strength xi. When combining CMB, H0, and the SDSS LRG halo power spectrum from

implications for the photo-ionization rate derived from the emissivity of star
forming galaxies and quasars. Finally, our analysis reveals a previously

correlation as a function of redshift in light of the deep radio continuum
surveys which may become possible using the SKA. To keep a fixed ratio between
the FIR and predominantly non-thermal radio continuum emission of a normal
star-forming galaxy requires a nearly constant ratio between galaxy magnetic
field and radiation field energy densities. While the additional term of IC
losses off of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is negligible in the local
Universe, the rapid increase in the strength of the CMB energy density (i.e.
$\sim(1+z)^{4})$ suggests that evolution in the FIR-radio correlation should
occur with infrared (IR; $8-1000 \micron$)/radio ratios increasing with
redshift. At present, observations do not show such a trend with redshift;
$z\sim6$ radio-quiet QSOs appear to lie on the local FIR-radio correlation
while a sample of $z\sim4.4$ and $z\sim2.2$ SMGs exhibit ratios that are a
factor of $\sim$2.5 {\it below} the canonical value. I also derive a 5$\sigma$
point-source sensitivity goal of $\approx$20 nJy (i.e. $\sigma_{\rm RMS} \sim
4$ nJy) requiring that the SKA specified be $A_{\rm eff}/T_{\rm sys}\approx
15000$ m$^{2}$ K$^{-1}$; achieving this sensitivity should enable the detection
of galaxies forming stars at a rate of $\ga25 M_{\sun} {\rm yr}^{-1}$, at all
redshifts if present. By taking advantage of the fact that the non-thermal
component of a galaxy's radio continuum emission will be quickly suppressed by
IC losses off of the CMB, leaving only the thermal (free-free) component, I
argue that deep radio continuum surveys at frequencies $\ga$10 GHz may prove to
be the best probe for characterizing the high-$z$ star formation history of the
Universe unbiased by dust.

zero-viscosity circumbinary gas disk with two-dimensional simulations, using
the hydrodynamic code FLASH. We analyze perturbations arising from the 530 km/s
recoil of a 10^6 M_sun binary, oriented in the plane of the disk, assuming
either an adiabatic or a pseudo-isothermal equation of state for the gas. We
find that a single-armed spiral shock wave forms and propagates outward,
sweeping up about 20% of the mass of the disk. The morphology and evolution of
the perturbations agrees well with those of caustics predicted to occur in a
collisionless disk. Assuming that the disk radiates nearly instantaneously to
maintain a constant temperature, we estimate the amount of dissipation and
corresponding post-merger light-curve. The luminosity rises steadily on the
time-scale of months, and reaches few times 10^{43} erg/s, corresponding to
about 10% of the Eddington luminosity of the central SMBHB. We also analyze the
case in which gravitational wave emission results in a 5% mass loss in the
merger remnant. The mass-loss reduces the shock overdensities and the overall
luminosity of the disk by 15-20%, without any other major effects on the spiral

the model in reproducing the colours and near-IR luminosities of high-redshift

the colour-magnitude and colour-colour relations at z ~ 2, both for
nearly-passive and for star-forming galaxies. The model with TP-AGB produces
star-forming galaxies with red V-K colours, thus revising the unique
interpretation of high-redshift red objects as 'red & dead'. We also show that
without the TP-AGB the semi-analytic model fails at reproducing the observed

explore the effect of nebular emission on the predicted colour-magnitude

significant role in reddening their colours, at least in the range of
star-formation rates covered by the model. Finally, the rest-frame K-band

indicates that the AGN feedback recipe that is adopted to regulate the

continuum show significant variability on timescales as short as 3.3 days

X-ray absorbers with projected outflow velocities of up to 0.76 c. The maximum
outflow velocity constrains the angle between the wind velocity and our line of
sight to be less than ~ 22 degrees. We identify the following components of the
outflow: (a) Highly ionized X-ray absorbing material (2.9 < logxi < 3.9) and a
column density of log N_H ~ 23 outflowing at velocities of up to 0.76 c. (b)
Low-ionization X-ray absorbing gas with log N_H ~ 22.8. We find that flatter
spectra appear to result in lower outflow velocities. Based on our spectral
analysis of observations of APM 08279+5255 over a period of 1.2 years (proper

Schr\""odinger formalism we are able to probe the time-dependent regime, which

We calculate the occupation number of particles for a scalar field and complex
scalar field. We demonstrate that the particles from the scalar field are
unaffected by the charge of the Reisner-Nordstr\""om domain wall, as is expected
since the scalar field doesn't carry any charge, which would couple to the
charge of the Reisner-Nordstr\""om domain wall. Here the situation effectively
reduces to the uncharged case, a spherically symmetric domain wall. To take the
charge into account, we consider the complex scalar field which represents
charged particles and anti-particles. Here investigate two different cases,
first the non-extremal case and second the extremal case. In the non-extremal
case we demonstrate that when the particle (anti-particle) carries charge
opposite to that of the domain wall, the occupation number becomes suppressed
during late times of the collapse. Therefore the dominate occupation number is
when the particle (anti-particle) carries the same charge as the domain wall,
as expected due to the Coulomb potential carried by the domain walls. In the
extremal case we demonstrate that as time increases the temperature of the
radiation decreases until when the domain wall reaches the horizon and the
temperature then goes to zero. This is in agreement with the Hawking
temperature for charged black holes.

stripping and potential destruction of a cool core within a rich cluster. The
X-ray emission from the Ophiuchus Cluster core exhibits a comet-like morphology
extending to the north, driven by merging activity, indicative of ram-pressure
stripping caused by rapid motion through the ambient cluster gas. A cold front
at the southern edge implies a velocity of 1000$\pm$200 km/s (M~0.6). The X-ray
emission from the cluster core is sharply peaked. As previously noted, the peak
is offset by 4 arcsec (~2 kpc) from the optical center of the associated cD
galaxy, indicating that ram pressure has slowed the core, allowing the
relatively collisionless stars and dark matter to carry on ahead. The cluster
exhibits the strongest central temperature gradient of any massive cluster
observed to date: the temperature rises from 0.7 keV within 1 kpc of the
brightness peak, to 10 keV by 30 kpc. A strong metallicity gradient is also
observed within the same region. This supports a picture in which the outer
parts of the cool core have been stripped by ram-pressure due to its rapid
motion. The cooling time of the innermost gas is very short, ~5$\times10^7$
yrs. Within the central 10 kpc radius, multiple small-scale fronts and a
complex thermodynamic structure are observed, indicating significant motions.
Beyond the central 50 kpc, and out to a radius ~150 kpc, the cluster appears
relatively isothermal and has near constant metallicity. The exception is a
large, coherent ridge of enhanced metallicity observed to trail the cool core,

their outer ice shells. A subsurface ocean frictionally decouples the shell
from the interior. This has led to proposals that a weak tidal or atmospheric
torque might cause the shell to rotate differentially with respect to the
synchronously rotating interior. As a result of centrifugal and tidal forces,
the ocean would assume an ellipsoidal shape with its long axis aligned toward
the parent planet. Any displacement of the shell away from its equilibrium
position would induce strains thereby increasing its elastic energy and giving
rise to an elastic restoring torque. We compare the elastic torque with the
tidal torque acting on Europa and the atmospheric torque acting on Titan. For
Europa, the tidal torque is far too weak to produce stresses that could
fracture the ice shell, thus refuting a widely advocated idea. Instead, we
suggest that cracks arise from time-dependent stresses due to non-hydrostatic
gravity anomalies from tidally driven, episodic convection in the interior. Two
years of Cassini RADAR observations of Titan's surface are interpreted as
implying an angular displacement of ~0.24 degrees relative to synchroneity.
Compatibility of the amplitude and phase of the observed non-synchronous
rotation with estimates of the atmospheric torque requires that Titan's shell
be decoupled from its interior. We find that the elastic torque balances the
atmospheric torque at an angular displacement <0.05 degrees, thus coupling the
shell to the interior. Moreover, if Titan's surface were spinning faster than
synchronous, the tidal torque tending to restore synchronous rotation would
certainly be larger than the atmospheric torque. There must either be a problem
with the interpretation of the radar observations, or with our understanding of
Titan's atmosphere and/or interior.

biomolecular recognition is presented. In the model, a layer of high dielectric
constant material (representative of the solvent, water) whose thickness may
vary separates two regions of low dielectric constant material (representative
of proteins, DNA, RNA, or similar materials), in each of which is embedded a
point charge. For identical charges, the presence of the screening layer always
lowers the energy compared to the case of point charges in an infinite medium
of low dielectric constant. Somewhat surprisingly, the presence of a
sufficiently thick screening layer also lowers the energy compared to the case
of point charges in an infinite medium of high dielectric constant. For charges
of opposite sign, the screening layer always lowers the energy compared to the
case of point charges in an infinite medium of either high or low dielectric
constant. The behavior of the energy leads to a substantially increased
repulsive force between charges of the same sign. The repulsive force between
charges of opposite signs is weaker than in an infinite medium of low
dielectric constant material but stronger than in an infinite medium of high
dielectric constant material. The presence of this behavior, which we name
asymmetric screening, in the simple system presented here confirms the
generality of the behavior that was established in a more complicated system of
an arbitrary number of charged dielectric spheres in an infinite solvent.

observations of LABOCA, 2MASS, IRAS, Spitzer photometric data and the IRS data
for Haro11. We find that a significant mass of dust is revealed when using
submm constraints compared to that measured with only mid-IR to far-IR
observations extending only to 160 microns. For NGC1705 and Haro11, an excess
in submillimeter wavelengths is detected and we rerun our SED procedure adding
a cold dust component (10K) to better describe the high 870 micron flux derived
from LABOCA observations, which significantly improves the fit. We find that at
least 70% of the dust mass of these two galaxies can reside in a cold dust
component. We also show that the subsequent dust-to-gas mass ratios,
considering HI and CO observations, can be strikingly high for Haro11 in
comparison with what is usually expected for these low-metallicity
environments. Furthermore, we derive the SFR of our galaxies and compare them
to the Schmidt law. Haro11 falls anomalously far from the Schmidt relation.
These results may suggest that a reservoir of hidden gas could be present in
molecular form not traced by the current CO observations. We also derive the
total IR luminosities derived from our models and compare them with relations

occurs in non-ideal photonic-band gap.

set of eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix obtained from tracing out one
part. Such spectra are known in several cases to contain important information
beyond that in the entanglement entropy. This paper studies the entanglement
spectrum for a variety of critical and near-critical quantum lattice models in
one dimension, chiefly by the iTEBD numerical method, which enables both
integrable and non-integrable models to be studied. We find that the
distribution of eigenvalues in the entanglement spectra agrees with an
approximate result derived by Calabrese and Lefevre to an accuracy of a few
percent for all models studied. This result applies whether the correlation
length is intrinsic or generated by the finite matrix size accessible in iTEBD.
For the transverse Ising model, the known exact results for the entanglement
spectrum are used to confirm the validity of the iTEBD approach. For more
general models, no exact result is available but the iTEBD results directly
test the hypothesis that all moments of the reduced density matrix are
determined by a single parameter.

the effective interaction provides attraction and one can therefore ask about
the stability of the system. We calculate the energy density of the system in
the Thomas-Fermi approximation, determine the profile of the gas, and the
critical number of particle in the system as function of the relevant
interaction parameters. The instability can be deduced from a simple breathing
mode argument which explains the scaling found numerically. The critical
particle number turns out to be extremely large unless the external confinement
is very tight. We therefore conclude that the effect is insignificant for
standard trapping potentials and that the magnetic dipole interaction is the
important term at zero scattering length. However, for tight confinement as in
an optical lattice higher-order corrections can become important.

several of the polarisation observables can be instrumental to extract not only

of the nucleon spin in external electro-magnetic fields. Amongst the questions

tropical cyclones (TC) is a controversial issue. Existing historical databases
on the subject are not fully reliable, but a more fundamental hindrance is the
lack of basic understanding regarding the intrinsic nature of tropical cyclone
genesis and evolution. It is known that tropical cyclones involve more than a
passive response to changing external forcing, but it is not clear which
dynamic behaviour best describes them. Here we present a new approach based on
the application of the power dissipation index (PDI), which constitutes an
estimation of released energy, to individual tropical cyclones. A robust law
emerges for the statistics of PDI, valid in four different ocean basins and
over long time periods. In addition to suggesting a novel description of the
physics of tropical cyclones in terms of critical phenomena, the law allows to
quantify their response to changing climatic conditions, with an increase in
the largest PDI values with sea surface temperature or the presence of El Nino
phenomenon, depending on the basin under consideration. In this way, we
demonstrate that the recent upswing in North Atlantic hurricane activity does
not involve TCs quantitatively different from those in other sustained
high-activity periods prior to 1970.

however the observational correlation between [Ne II] luminosities and measured
X-ray luminosities shows a large scatter. Such spread limits the utility of
this line as a probe of the gaseous phase of disks, as several authors have
suggested pollution by outflows as a probable cause of the observed scatter. In
this work we explore the possibility that the large variations in the observed
[Ne II] luminosity may be caused instead by different star-disk parameters. In
particular we study the effects that the hardness of the irradiating source and
the structure (flaring) of the disk have on the luminosity and spectral profile
of the [Ne II] 12.8 micron line. We find that varying these parameter can
indeed cause up to an order of magnitude variation in the emission luminosities
which may explain the scatter observed, although our models predict somewhat
smaller luminosities than those recently reported by other authors who observed
the line with the Spitzer Space Telescope. Our models also show that the
hardness of the spectrum has only a limited (undetectable) effect on the line
profiles, while changes in the flaring power of the disk significantly affect
the size of the [Ne II] emission region and, as a consequence, its line
profile. In particular we suggest that broad line profiles centred on the
stellar radial velocity may be indicative of flat disks seen at large

these known processes. These include four new SNe we have discovered, and two
previously unexplained events (SN 2005ap; SCP 06F6) that we can now identify as

velocity and magnetic field fluctuations plays a crucial role. In general it
consists of two parts, one independent of and another one proportional to the
mean magnetic field. The first part may be nonzero only in the presence of mhd
turbulence, maintained, e.g., by small-scale dynamo action. It corresponds to a
battery, which lets a mean magnetic field grow from zero to a finite value. The
second part, which covers, e.g., the alpha effect, is important for large-scale

fluctuations or, what is equivalent, of vorticity and magnetic field
fluctuations. This goes beyond the Yoshizawa effect, which consists in the

properties of the EOS for symmetric nuclear matter and the symmetry energy
predicted by both the sophisticated isospin and momentum dependent MDI model

bursts' duration distribution and also the duration-hardness bivariate

three or maybe more groups. Similarly to the BATSE data, to explain the BAT
GRBs duration distribution three components are needed. Although, the relative

the concept of primes. The aim of this paper is to show that the concept of
primes in Ancient China can be traced back to the time of Confuciusor (about
500 B.C.) or more ago. This implies that the concept of primes in Ancient China
is much earlier than the concept of primes in Euclid's \emph{Elements}(about
300 B.C.) of Ancient Greece. We also shows that the algorithm for counting the
greatest common divisor in Ancient China is essentially the Euclidean algorithm
or the binary gcd algorithm. Donald E. Knuth said that ""the binary gcd
algorithm was discovered by J. Stein in 1961"". Nevertheless, Knuth was wrong.
The ancient Chinese algorithm is clearly much earlier than J. Stein's

  Abstract: Sampling-based methods have previously been proposed for the
problem of finding interesting associations in data, even for low-support
items. While these methods do not guarantee precise results, they can be vastly
more efficient than approaches that rely on exact counting. However, for many
similarity measures no such methods have been known. In this paper we show how
a wide variety of measures can be supported by a simple biased sampling method.
The method also extends to find high-confidence association rules. We
demonstrate theoretically that our method is superior to exact methods when the
threshold for ""interesting similarity/confidence"" is above the average pairwise
similarity/confidence, and the average support is not too low. Our method is
particularly good when transactions contain many items. We confirm in
experiments on standard association mining benchmarks that this gives a
significant speedup on real data sets (sometimes much larger than the
theoretical guarantees). Reductions in computation time of over an order of
magnitude, and significant savings in space, are observed.

Wilson-Harrington is a possible target of the joint European Space Agency (ESA)

mission. Physical studies of this object are relevant to this mission, and also
to understanding its asteroidal or cometary nature. Aims. Our aim is to obtain
significant new constraints on the surface thermal properties of this object.
Methods. We present mid-infrared photometry in two filters (16 and 22 microns)
obtained with NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope on February 12, 2007, and results
from the application of the Near Earth Asteroid Thermal Model (NEATM).We
obtained high S/N in two mid-IR bands allowing accurate measurements of its
thermal emission. Results. We obtain a well constrained beaming parameter (eta
= 1.39 +/- 0.26) and obtain a diameter and geometric albedo of D = 3.46 +/-
0.32 km, and pV = 0.059 +/- 0.011. We also obtain similar results when we apply
this best-fitting thermal model to single-band mid-IR photometry reported by
Campins et al. (1995), Kraemer et al. (2005) and Reach et al. (2007).
Conclusions. The albedo of 4015 Wilson-Harrington is low, consistent with those
of comet nuclei and primitive C-, P-, D-type asteorids. We establish a rough
lower limit for the thermal inertia of W-H of 60 Jm^-2s^(-0.5)K^-1 when it is
at r=1AU, which is slightly over the limit of 30 Jm^-2s^(-0.5)K-1 derived by

dynamics near the depinning threshold depending on the magnitude of the

current-voltage characteristics (I-V) are strongly dependent on the history of
magnetic field and current cycling. The sharp peak, so called ""peak effect""
(PE), observed in \mu_0H-Ic curve is due to a metastable state which can be
removed after current cycling. At low field, I-V curves exhibit steps which
clearly enligth a ""fingerprint phenomenon"" as it can be seen the current
dependence of the differential resistance Rd = dV/dI. We associate this to
vortices flow through uncorrelated channels for the highly defective lattice.
Indeed, as field sufficiently increase, these peaks merge giving broader ones
indicating a crossover from filamentaty strings to braid river like in which
vortex-vortex interactions becomes significant. As confirmed by the
discontinuity in the critical exponent value \beta determined in the vicinity
of the threshold current using the power-law scaling V (I-Ic)^\beta with a
crossover from \beta = 2.2 to \beta = 1.2. The strong vortex correlation along

a result of F. Brown, the cell-zeta algebra is equal to the algebra of

relations coming from the geometry of moduli spaces, which leads to a natural
definition of a formal version of the cell-zeta algebra, conjecturally
isomorphic to the formal multizeta algebra defined by the much-studied double

statistical models for incompressible Navier-Stokes fluids. The latter can be
considered either \textit{deterministic} or \textit{stochastic,} respectively
for \textit{regular} or \textit{turbulent flows.} In this work we claim that a
possible statistical formulation of this type can be achieved by means of the
1-point (local) velocity-space probability density function (PDF, $f_{1}$) to
be determined in the framework of the so-called inverse kinetic theory (IKT).
There are several important consequences of the theory. These include, in
particular, the characterization of the initial PDF [for the statistical model
${f_{1},\Gamma} ]$ . This is found to be generally non-Gaussian PDF, even in
the case of flows which are regular at the initial time. Moreover, both for
regular and turbulent flows, its time evolution is provided by a Liouville
equation, while the corresponding Liouville operator is found to depend only on
a finite number of velocity moments of the same PDF. Hence, its time evolution
depends (functionally) solely on the same PDF. In addition, the statistical
model here developed determines uniquely both the initial condition and the
time evolution of $f_{1}.$ As a basic implication, the theory allows the
\textit{exact construction of the corresponding statistical equation for the
stochastic-averaged PDF}and the \textit{unique representation of the
multi-point PDF}'s in solely in terms of the 1-point PDF. As an example, the
case of the reduced 2-point PDF's, usually adopted for the statistical
description of NS turbulence, is considered.

w neq -1/3) solutions for the ratio of the overdensity radius to its value at
the turnaround epoch (y) for general cosmological parameters. Also the exact
and approximate solutions of the overdensity at the turnaround epoch (zeta) are
obtained for general w. Thus, we are able to obtain the non-linear overdensity
Delta = 1 + delta at any epoch for the given DE model. The non-linear
overdensity at the virial epoch (Delta_{vir}) is obtained by using the virial
theorem and the energy conservation. The non-linear overdensity of every DE
model converges to that of the Einstein de Sitter universe ~ 147 when
z_{vir}increases. We find that the observed quantities at high redshifts are
insensitive to the different w models. The low-redshift cluster (z_{vir} ~
0.04, i.e., z_{ta} ~ 0.7) shows the most model dependent feature and it should
be a suitable object for testing DE models. Also as Omo increases, the model
dependence of the observed quantities decreases. The error in the approximate
solutions is at most 2% for a wide range of the parameter space. Even though
the analytic forms of y and \zeta are obtained for the constant w, they can be
generalized to the slowly varying w. Thus, these analytic forms of the scale

Supporting evidence is drawn not only from the instruments of time in the form
of the roofed spherical sundial, but also from other Imperial monuments,
notably Nero's Domus Aurea and Augustus's complex of structures on the Campus
Martius: his Ara Pacis, the ""Horologium Augusti"", and his Mausoleum. Hadrian's
Mausoleum and potentially part of his Villa at Tivoli are drawn into this
argument as correlatives. Ultimately, it is proposed that sun and time were

details of the output field distribution are of minor physical interest but
proper allowance is made for transformation of the incident beam polarization
state. This enables to obtain the spin and orbital angular momentum
representations which are valid everywhere in the transformed beam space.
Simple analytical results are available for the transversely homogeneous
circularly polarized incident beam limited only by the circular aperture.
Behavior of the spin and orbital angular momenta of the output beam and their
dependences on the focusing strength (aperture angle) are analyzed. The
obtained analytical results are in good qualitative and reasonable quantitative
agreement to the calculation performed for the spatially inhomogeneous Gaussian
and Laguerre-Gaussian beams. In application to Laguerre-Gaussian beams, the
model provides possibility for analyzing the angular momentum transformation in
beams already possessing some mixture of the spin and orbital angular momenta.
The model supplies efficient and physically transparent means for qualitative
analysis of the spin-to-orbital angular momentum conversion. It can be
generalized to incident beams with complicated spatial and polarization
structure.

we derived a simple formula for the three-pulse echo amplitude. As in the case
of two-pulse echo the magnetic field dependence of the tree-pulse echo
amplitude in glasses is related to quadrupole electric moments of TLS's
non-spherical nuclei and/or dipole-dipole interaction of their nuclear spins.
These two mechanisms are responsible for the fine level splitting of TLS. As a
result TLS transforms to multi-level system with the fine level splitting

is accompanied by emission of nonequilibrium bosons. Here I solve numerically a
full set of nonlinear kinetic balance equations for stacked Josephson
junctions, which allows analysis of strongly nonequilibrium phenomena. It is
shown that nonlinearity becomes significant already at very small
disequilibrium. The following new, essentially nonlinear effects are obtained:
(i) At even-gap voltages $V=2n \Delta/e$ $(n=2,3,...)$ nonequilibrium bosonic
bands overlap. This leads to enhanced emission of $\Omega = 2 \Delta$ bosons
and to appearance of dips in tunnel conductance. (ii) A new type of radiative
solution is found at strong disequilibrium. It is characterized by the fast
stimulated relaxation of nonequilibrium quasiparticles. A stack in this state
behaves as a light emitting diode and directly converts electric power to boson
emission, without utilization of the ac-Josephson effect. This leads to very
high radiation efficacy and to significant radiative cooling of the stack. The
phenomenon can be used for realization of a new type of superconducting cascade

understood in practical contexts. Here, we present a broad characterization of

resolution limit phenomenon for modularity maximization. Second, we show that
the modularity function Q exhibits extreme degeneracies: it typically admits an
exponential number of distinct high-scoring solutions and typically lacks a
clear global maximum. Third, we derive the limiting behavior of the maximum
modularity Q_max for one model of infinitely modular networks, showing that it
depends strongly both on the size of the network and on the number of modules
it contains. Finally, using three real-world metabolic networks as examples, we
show that the degenerate solutions can fundamentally disagree on many, but not
all, partition properties such as the composition of the largest modules and
the distribution of module sizes. These results imply that the output of any
modularity maximization procedure should be interpreted cautiously in
scientific contexts. They also explain why many heuristics are often successful
at finding high-scoring partitions in practice and why different heuristics can
disagree on the modular structure of the same network. We conclude by
discussing avenues for mitigating some of these behaviors, such as combining
information from many degenerate solutions or using generative models.

equations with equal GVD coefficients, which generate only simple single-peak

decades ago, there has been intense interest in both the fundamental physics

conductance through a system, they do not probe critical other aspects of the
underlying physics, including energy eigenstate distribution, magnetic field
effects, and band structure. These are better accessed by theoretical modeling,
especially modeling of the energy and wavefunction distribution across a
system: the local density of states (DOS). In this thesis, a numerical Greens
function model of the local DOS in a 1DEG has been developed and implemented.
The model uses an iterative method in a discrete lattice to calculate Greens

arbitrary surface gate geometry and arbitrary finite magnetic field conditions.
When compared with exact analytical results for the local DOS, waveband
structure, and real band structure, the model returned very accurate results. A

the necessity of a modification of the proton optical potential. On the other

gravitational dynamics. However, depending on the shape of the potential, tides
can also become fully compressive. When that is the case, they might trigger or
strengthen the formation of galactic substructures (star clusters, tidal dwarf
galaxies), instead of destroying them. We perform N-body simulations of
interacting galaxies to quantify this effect. We demonstrate that tidal
compression occurs repeatedly during a galaxy merger, independently of the
specific choice of parameterization. With a model tailored to the Antennae
galaxies, we show that the distribution of compressive tides matches the
locations and timescales of observed substructures. After extending our study
to a broad range of parameters, we conclude that neither the importance of the
compressive tides (~15% of the stellar mass) nor their duration (~ 10 Myr) are
strongly affected by changes in the progenitors' configurations and orbits.
Moreover, we show that individual clumps of matter can enter compressive
regions several times in the course of a simulation. We speculate that this may
spawn multiple star formation episodes in some star clusters, through e.g.,
enhanced gas retention.
