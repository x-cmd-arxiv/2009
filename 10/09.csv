telescopes with large numbers of antennas. The problem is essentially that of
rapidly transposing a matrix that is too large to store on one single device;
in radio interferometry, it occurs because data from each antenna needs to be
routed to an array of processors that will each handle a limited portion of the
data (a frequency range, say) but requires input from each antenna. We present
a low-cost solution allowing the correlator to transpose its data in real time,
without contending for bandwidth, via a butterfly network requiring neither
additional RAM memory nor expensive general-purpose switching hardware. We
discuss possible implementations of this using FPGA, CMOS, analog logic and
optical technology, and conclude that the corner turner cost can be small even
for upcoming massive radio arrays.

the criteria of considering a single-peak light curve for objects with
amplitudes lower than 0.15 mag and a double-peak light curve for objects with
variability >0.15mag. The best Maxwellian fits were obtained with the threshold
between 0.10 and 0.15mag. The mean light-curve amplitude for the entire sample

evolved) objects are more elongated than the bigger ones. From the model
results, it appears that hydrostatic equilibrium can explain the statistical
results of almost the entire sample, which means hydrostatic equilibrium is
probably reached by almost all TNOs in the H range [-1,7]. This implies that
for plausible albedos of 0.04 to 0.20, objects with diameters from 300km to

power on large scales. The dark-energy power spectrum for these models are also
explicitly obtained. On degree scales, the total enhancement may be as large as

recently entered a renaissance period due to novel intuitions from quantum
information theory and to increasing attention on the dynamical aspects of
single quantum systems. In the present contribution a simple but effective
theoretical framework is introduced to clarify the connections between a purely
mechanical description and the thermodynamic characterization of the
equilibrium state of an isolated quantum system. A salient feature of our
approach is the very transparent distinction between the statistical aspects
and the dynamical aspects in the description of isolated quantum systems. Like
in the classical statistical mechanics, the equilibrium distribution of any
property is identified on the basis of the time evolution of the considered
system. As a consequence equilibrium properties of quantum system appear to
depend on the details of the initial state due to the abundance of constants of
the motion in the Schr\""odinger dynamics. On the other hand the study of the
probability distributions of some functions, such as the entropy or the
equilibrium state of a subsystem, in statistical ensembles of pure states
reveals the crucial role of typicality as the bridge between macroscopic
thermodynamics and microscopic quantum dynamics. We shall consider two
particular ensembles: the random pure state ensemble and the fixed expectation
energy ensemble. The relation between the introduced ensembles, the properties
of a given isolated system, and the standard quantum statistical description
are discussed throughout the presentation. Finally we point out the conditions
which should be satisfied by an ensemble in order to get meaningful
thermodynamical characterization of an isolated quantum system.

one of the stars, Boo-127, shows an atypically high [Mg/Ca] ratio, indicative
of stochastic enrichment processes within the dSph galaxy. Similar results have

two different statistics introduced in Part I. In order to analyze their
consistency with thermodynamics, these quantities of interest are evaluated in
the limit of large number of components of the isolated system. The main
results can be summarized as follows: typical values of the entropy and of the
equilibrium reduced density matrix as functions of the internal energy in the

thermodynamics. On the contrary, the thermodynamical description is recovered
from the random pure state ensemble (RPSE), provided that one considers systems
large enough. The thermodynamic limit of the considered properties for the spin
system reveals a number of important features. First canonical statistics (and
thus, canonical typicality as long as the fluctuations around the average value
are small) emerges without the need of assuming the microcanonical space for
the global pure state. Moreover, we rigorously prove (i) the equivalence of the
""global temperature,"" derived from the entropy equation of state, with the
""local temperature"" determining the canonical state of the subsystems; and (ii)

antiproton production, that a store is terminated as soon as the target stash
size for the next store is reached, and that the only downtime is due to store
turn-around time. An optimal range of stash sizes is predicted. Since the start
of Tevatron operations based on this procedure, we have seen an improvement of
approximately 35% in integrated luminosity. Other recent operational
improvements have been achieved by decreasing the shot-setup time and by
reducing beam-beam effects by making the proton and antiproton brightnesses
more compatible, for example by scraping protons to smaller emittances.

local density approximation (LDA) can be reproduced by a two-orbital model, it
has been argued that the bands that cross the chemical potential result from
the strong hybridization of three of the Fe 3d orbitals. For this reason, a
three-orbital Hamiltonian obtained with the Slater-Koster formalism by
considering the hybridization of the As p orbitals with the Fe d_xz,d_yz, and
d_xy orbitals is discussed here. This model reproduces qualitatively the FS
shape and orbital composition obtained by LDA calculations for undoped
pnictides when four electrons per Fe are considered. Within a mean-field
approximation, its magnetic and orbital properties in the undoped case are
described. With increasing Coulomb repulsion, four regimes are obtained: (1)
paramagnetic, (2) magnetic (pi,0) spin order, (3) the same (pi,0) spin order
but now including orbital order, and finally (4) a magnetic and orbital ordered
insulator. The spin-singlet pairing operators allowed by the lattice and
orbital symmetries are also constructed. It is found that for pairs of
electrons involving up to diagonal nearest-neighbors sites, the only fully
gapped and purely intraband spin-singlet pairing operator is given by
Delta(k)=f(k)\sum_{alpha} d_{k,alpha,up}d_{-k,alpha,down} with f(k)=1 or
f(k)=cos(k_x)cos(k_y) which would arise only if the electrons in all different

formation process. In hierarchical formation scenarios, SMBHs are expected to
form binaries following the merger of their host galaxies. If these binaries do
not coalesce before the merger with a third galaxy, the formation of a black
hole triple system is possible. Numerical simulations of the dynamics of
triples within galaxy cores exhibit phases of very high eccentricity (as high
as $e \sim 0.99$). During these phases, intense bursts of gravitational
radiation can be emitted at orbital periapsis. This produces a gravitational
wave signal at frequencies substantially higher than the orbital frequency. The
likelihood of detection of these bursts with pulsar timing and the Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna ({\it LISA}) is estimated using several population
models of SMBHs with masses $\gtrsim 10^7 {\rm M_\odot}$. Assuming a fraction
of binaries $\ge 0.1$ in triple system, we find that few to few dozens of these
bursts will produce residuals $>1$ ns, within the sensitivity range of
forthcoming pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). However, most of such bursts will be
washed out in the underlying confusion noise produced by all the other
'standard' SMBH binaries emitting in the same frequency window. A detailed data
analysis study would be required to assess resolvability of such sources.
Implementing a basic resolvability criterion, we find that the chance of
catching a resolvable burst at a one nanosecond precision level is 2-50%,
depending on the adopted SMBH evolution model. On the other hand, the
probability of detecting bursts produced by massive binaries (masses $\gtrsim

massive stellar evolution at solar metallicity supplemented by new calculations
at subsolar metallicity. Explosions are simulated by the motion of a piston
near the edge of the iron core and the resulting light curves and spectra are
calculated using full multi-wavelength radiation transport. Formulae are
developed that describe approximately how the model observables (light curve
luminosity and duration) scale with the progenitor mass, explosion energy, and
radioactive nucleosynthesis. Comparison with observational data shows that the
explosion energy of typical supernovae (as measured by kinetic energy at

ergs, with a typical value of ~0.9 x 10^51 ergs. Despite the large variation,
the models exhibit a tight relationship between luminosity and expansion
velocity, similar to that previously employed empirically to make SNe IIP
standardized candles. This relation is explained by the simple behavior of
hydrogen recombination in the supernova envelope, but we find a sensitivity to
progenitor metallicity and mass that could lead to systematic errors.

use a large Monte Carlo library of SFHs to study as a function of galaxy
spectral type and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) the statistical uncertainties of
M/L values using either absorption-line data or broad band colors. The accuracy
of M/L estimates can be significantly improved by using metal-sensitive indices
in combination with age-sensitive indices, in particular for galaxies with
intermediate-age or young stellar populations. While M/L accuracy clearly
depends on the spectral S/N ratio, there is no significant gain in improving
the S/N much above 50/pix and limiting uncertainties of 0.03 dex are reached.
Assuming that dust is accurately corrected or absent and that the redshift is
known, color-based M/L estimates are only slightly more uncertain than
spectroscopic estimates (at comparable spectroscopic and photometric quality),
but are more easily affected by systematic biases. This is the case in
particular for galaxies with bursty SFHs (high Hdelta at fixed D4000), the M/L

identified. Because short-period systems which will merge in less than a Hubble
time have already been observed as binary pulsars, they are important both as
gravitational wave sources for observatories such as LIGO but also as
progenitors for short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs). The fact that these systems
must have large systemic velocities implies that by the time they merge, they
will be far from their formation site. The locations of merging sites depend
sensitively on the gravitational potential of the galaxy host, which until now
has been assumed to be static. Here we refine such calculations to incorporate
the temporal evolution of the host's gravitational potential as well as that of
its nearby neighbors using cosmological simulations of structure formation.
This results in merger site distributions that are more diffusively distributed
with respect to their putative hosts, with locations extending out to distances
of a few Mpc for lighter halos. The degree of mixing between neighboring
compact binary populations computed in this way is severely enhanced in
environments with a high number density of galaxies. We find that SGRB redshift
estimates based solely on the nearest galaxy in projection can be very
inaccurate, if progenitor systems inhere large systematic kicks at birth.

these galaxies with detectable counterparts, which are expected to contain all
likely cluster members. We then use photometric redshifts and colour selection
to separate background galaxies from potential cluster members and test the
reliability of this technique using archival observations of submillimetre
galaxies. We find two potential MS 0451-03 members, which, if they are both
cluster galaxies have a total star-formation rate (SFR) of ~100 solar masses
per year -- a significant fraction of the combined SFR of all the other
galaxies in MS 0451-03. We also examine the stacked rest-frame mid-infrared,
millimetre and radio emission of cluster members below our AzTEC detection
limit and find that the SFRs of mid-IR selected galaxies in the cluster and
redshift-matched field populations are comparable. In contrast, the average SFR
of the morphologically classified late-type cluster population is ~3 times less
than the corresponding redshift-matched field galaxies. This suggests that
these galaxies may be in the process of being transformed on the red-sequence

environment of MS 0451-03 appears to suppress star-formation in late-type

focusing on the construction of the collision integral for the Boltzmann

we derive an equation describing the dynamics of the density matrix in the

Elastic scattering requires conservation of the total energy, including the
spin-orbit interaction energy with the electric field: this results in a first
correction to the customary collision integral found in the Born approximation.
A second correction is due to the change in the carrier position during
collisions. It stems from the part of the density matrix off-diagonal in wave
vector. The two corrections to the collision integral add up and are
responsible for the total side-jump contribution to the spin-Hall current. The
spin-orbit-induced correction to the velocity operator also contains terms
diagonal and off-diagonal in momentum space, which together involve the total
force acting on the system. This force is explicitly shown to vanish (on the
average) in the steady state: thus the total contribution to the spin-Hall

two different physical treatments: shock heating driven by gravity only (GO)

halos at low-redshift offers a good match to local clusters, the model exhibits
non-standard features testable with larger surveys, including weakly running
slopes in hot gas observable--mass relations and ~10% departures from
self-similar redshift evolution for 10^14 Msun/h halos at redshift z ~ 1. We

fluid that lives on a dynamical worldvolume. Thus the blackfold equations split
into intrinsic (fluid-dynamical) equations, and extrinsic (generalized geodesic
embedding) equations. The intrinsic equations can be easily solved for
equilibrium configurations, thus providing an efficient formalism for the
approximate construction of novel stationary black holes. Furthermore, it is
possible to study time evolution. In particular, the long-wavelength component
of the Gregory-Laflamme instability of black branes is obtained as a sound-mode
instability of the effective fluid. We also discuss action principles,
connections to black hole thermodynamics, and other consequences and possible
extensions of the approach. Finally, we outline how the fluid/AdS-gravity

optical emission lines and have likely black hole masses <10^6 M_sun. Three out
of four objects were detected with >3sigma significance in ~25 ks exposures and
two observations had high enough signal-to-noise ratios for rudimentary
spectral analysis. We calculate hardness ratios (-0.43 to 0.01) for the three
detected objects and use them to estimate photon indices in the range of
Gamma=1.1-1.8. Relative to [OIII], the type 2 objects are X-ray faint in
comparison with Seyfert 1 galaxies, suggesting that the central engines are
obscured. We estimate the intrinsic absorption of each object under the
assumption that the [OIII] emission line luminosities are correlated with the
unabsorbed X-ray luminosity. The results are consistent with moderate
(N_H~10^22 cm^-2) absorption over the Galactic values in three of the four
objects, which might explain the non-detection of broad-line emission in
optical spectra. One object in our sample, SDSS J110912.40+612346.7, is a near
identical type 2 counterpart of the late-type Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4395. While
the two objects have very similar [OIII] luminosities, the type 2 object has an
X-ray/[OIII] flux ratio nearly an order of magnitude lower than NGC 4395. The
most plausible explanation for this difference is absorption of the primary
X-ray continuum of the type 2 object, providing an indication that
obscuration-based unified models of active galaxies can apply even at the
lowest luminosities seen among Seyfert nuclei, down to L_bol~10^40-10^41 erg/s.

features common to both late-type dwarfs and subdwarfs, and we assign it a

PHOENIX/GAIA synthetic spectra to the observations, accounting for the
coarsely-gridded nature of the models. Fits to the entire OSIRIS J-band and to
the metal-sensitive J-band atomic absorption features (Fe I, K I, and Al I
lines) yield model parameters that are most consistent with the metallicity of
the primary star and the high surface gravity expected of old late-type
objects. The effective temperatures and radii inferred from the model
atmosphere fitting broadly agree with those predicted by the evolutionary
models of Chabrier & Baraffe, and the model color-absolute magnitude relations
accurately predict the metallicity of HD 114762B. We conclude that current
low-mass, mildly metal-poor atmospheric and evolutionary models are mutually
consistent for spectral fits to medium-resolution J-band spectra of HD 114762B,
but are inconsistent for fits to low-resolution near-infrared spectra of mild
subdwarfs. Finally, we develop a technique for estimating distances to
ultracool subdwarfs based on a single near-infrared spectrum. We show that this

opportunity to study a population of these high-energy objects. This catalog
summarizes 46 high-confidence pulsed detections using the first six months of
data taken by the Large Area Telescope (LAT), Fermi's main instrument. Sixteen
previously unknown pulsars were discovered by searching for pulsed signals at
the positions of bright gamma-ray sources seen with the LAT, or at the
positions of objects suspected to be neutron stars based on observations at
other wavelengths. Pulsed gamma-ray emission was discovered from twenty-four
known pulsars by using ephemerides (timing solutions) derived from monitoring
radio pulsars. Eight of these new gamma-ray pulsars are millisecond pulsars.
The pulsed energy spectra can be described by a power law with an exponential
cutoff, with cutoff energies in the range 1 to 5 GeV. The rotational energy
loss rate (\dot{E}) of these neutron stars spans 5 decades, from ~3x10^{33}
erg/s to 5x10^{38} erg/s, and the apparent efficiencies for conversion to
gamma-ray emission range from ~0.1% to unity, although distance uncertainties
complicate efficiency estimates. The pulse shapes show substantial diversity,
but roughly 75% of the gamma-ray pulse profiles have two peaks, separated by
>0.2 of rotational phase. For most of the pulsars, gamma-ray emission appears
to come mainly from the outer magnetosphere, while polar-cap emission remains
plausible for a remaining few. Finally, these discoveries suggest that
gamma-ray-selected young pulsars are born at a rate comparable to that of their
radio-selected cousins and that the birthrate of all young gamma-ray-detected
pulsars is a substantial fraction of the expected Galactic supernova rate.

suite. For these cases, we assume in tandem the updated nominal Band 1
frequency range of 35-50 GHz with a likely extension up to 52 GHz; together
these frequencies optimize the Band 1 science return. The scope of the science
cases ranges from nearby stars to the re-ionization edge of the Universe. Two
cases provide additional leverage on the present ALMA Level One Science Goals
and are seen as particularly powerful motivations for building the Band 1
Receiver suite: (1) detailing the evolution of grains in protoplanetary disks,
as a complement to the gas kinematics, requires continuum observations out to
~35 GHz (~9mm); and (2) detecting CO 3-2 line emission from galaxies like the
Milky Way during the epoch of re-ionization, i.e., 6 < z < 10, also requires
Band 1 receiver coverage. The range of Band 1 science is wide, however, and
includes studies of very small dust grains in the ISM, pulsar wind nebulae,
radio supernovae, X-ray binaries, the Galactic Center (i.e., Sgr A*), dense
cloud cores, complex carbon-chain molecules, masers, magnetic fields in the
dense ISM, jets and outflows from young stars, distant galaxies, and galaxy
clusters (i.e., the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect). A comparison of ALMA and the
Jansky VLA (JVLA) at the same frequencies of Band 1 finds similar sensitivity
performance at 40-50 GHz, with a slight edge for ALMA at higher frequencies
(e.g., within a factor of 2 for continuum observations). With its larger number

given by the early-type galaxy fraction f_et, and early-type galaxies are

clusters is analyzed exactly as the EDisCS sample to provide a robust local
comparison. Our main results are: (1) f_et values for the SDSS and EDisCS
clusters exhibit no clear trend as a function of sigma. (2) Mid-z EDisCS
clusters around sigma = 500 km/s have f_et ~= 0.5 whereas high-z EDisCS

difference in the morphological content of EDisCS and SDSS clusters. None of
the EDisCS clusters have f_et greater than 0.6 whereas half of the SDSS
clusters lie above this value. This difference is seen in clusters of all
velocity dispersions. (4) There is a strong correlation between morphology and
star formation in SDSS and EDisCS clusters. This correlation holds independent
of sigma and z even though the fraction of [OII] emitters decreases from z~0.8

structural transformation and star formation quenching processes that strongly

from the Spitzer Space Telescope observations is presented. We characterize the
nature of the mid-IR active nuclear continuum by subtracting a template
starburst spectrum from the Seyfert spectra. The long wavelength part of the
spectrum contains a strong contribution from the starburst-heated cool dust;
this is used to effectively separate starburst-dominated Seyferts from those
dominated by the active nuclear continuum. Within the latter category, the
strength of the active nuclear continuum drops rapidly beyond ~ 20 micron. On
average, type 2 Seyferts have weaker short-wavelength active nuclear continua
as compared to type 1 Seyferts. Type 2 Seyferts can be divided into two types,
those with strong poly-cyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) bands and those
without. The latter type show polarized broad emission lines in their optical
spectra. The PAH-dominated type 2 Seyferts and Seyfert 1.8/1.9s show very
similar mid-IR spectra. However, after the subtraction of the starburst
component, there is a striking similarity in the active nuclear continuum of
all Seyfert optical types. PAH-dominated Seyfert 2s and Seyfert 1.8/1.9s tend
to show weak active nuclear continua in general. A few type 2 Seyferts with
weak/absent PAH bands show a bump in the spectrum between 15 and 20 micron. We
suggest that this bump is the peak of a warm (~200 K) blackbody dust emission,
which becomes clearly visible when the short-wavelength continuum is weaker.
This warm blackbody emission is also observed in other Seyfert optical
subtypes, suggesting a common origin in these active galactic nuclei.

that increases mass accretion rates onto protostars and in the process, creates
spectacular outflows. However, recently it has been argued that this magnetic
brake is so strong that early protostellar disks -- the cradles of planet
formation -- cannot form. Our three-dimensional numerical simulations of the
early stages of collapse (\lesssim 10^5 yr) of overdense star--forming clouds
form early outflows and have magnetically regulated and rotationally dominated
disks (inside 10 AU) with high accretion rates, despite the slip of the field
through the mostly neutral gas. We find that in three dimensions, magnetic
fields suppress gravitationally driven instabilities which would otherwise
prevent young, well ordered disks from forming. Our simulations have surprising
consequences for the early formation of disks, their density and temperature
structure, the mechanism and structure of early outflows, the flash heating of

shown by rigorous Evans function techniques to control the spectral stability

In particular, through our derivation of the WKB approximation we generalize
the modulation expansion of Whitham for the KdV to a more general class of
equations which admit periodic waves with nonzero mean. As a consequence, we
will show that, assuming a particular non-degeneracy condition, spectral

are explained by a U(1) x U(1) flavor symmetry. In the supersymmetric sector,
the charged sleptons have reasonably large flavor mixings, and the lightest is
metastable. As a result, supersymmetric events are characterized not by missing
energy, but by heavy metastable charged particles. Many supersymmetric events
are therefore fully reconstructible, and we can reconstruct most of the charged
sleptons by working up the long supersymmetric decay chains. We obtain
promising results for both masses and mixings, and conclude that, given a
favorable model, precise measurements at the LHC may help shed light not only
on new physics, but also on the standard model flavor parameters.

describing several high-energy and astrophysical effects. Recently, computer
simulations favored Juttner's as the relativistic generalization of Maxwell's
distribution for d=1,2,3 spatial dimensions and pointed to an invariant
temperature. In this work we argue an invariant temperature naturally follows
from manifest covariance. We present a new derivation of the manifestly
covariant Juttner's distribution and Equipartition Theorem. The standard
procedure to get the equilibrium distribution as a solution of the relativistic
Boltzmann's equation is here adopted. However, contrary to previous analysis,
we use cartesian coordinates in d+1 momentum space, with d spatial components.
The use of the multiplication theorem of Bessel functions turns crucial to
regain the known invariant form of Juttner's distribution. Since equilibrium
kinetic theory results should agree with thermodynamics in the comoving frame
to the gas the covariant pseudo-norm of a vector entering the distribution can
be identified with the reciprocal of temperature in such comoving frame. Then
by combining the covariant statistical moments of Juttner's distribution a
novel form of the Equipartition Theorem is advanced which also accommodates the
invariant comoving temperature and it contains, as a particular case, a
previous not manifestly covariant form.

In addition to the 3-metric, the proposed scale invariant theory also contains
a 3-vector potential $A_k$ as a dynamical variable. Although some of the
mathematics is similar to Weyl's ingenious but physically questionable theory,
the equations of motion of this new theory are second order in
time-derivatives. Thereby we avoid the problems associated with fourth order
time derivatives that plague Weyl's original theory. It is tempting to try to
interpret the vector potential $A_k$ as the electromagnetic field. We exhibit
four independent reasons for not giving into this temptation. A more likely
possibility is that it can play the role of ""dark matter"". Indeed, as noted in
scale invariance seems to play a role in the MOND phenomenology. Spatial
boundary conditions are derived from the free-endpoint variation method and a
preliminary analysis of the constraints and their propagation in the

phi are dynamically produced via a quantum transition at very low energies. The

the eq. of motion of phi and it generates the scalar potential v(phi)
responsible for the late time acceleration of our universe. Since the
appearance of phi may be at very low scales, close to present time, the
cosmological coincidence problem can be explained simply due to the size of the
coupling constant. We unify dark energy with inflation in terms of a single
scalar field phi, and we use the same potential v for inflation and dark
energy. However, after inflation phi decays completely and reheats the universe
at a scale E_RH propto h^2 m_Pl, where h is the coupling between the SM
particles and varphi. The field phi disappears from the spectrum during, from
reheating until its re-generation, and therefore it does not interfere with the
standard decelerating radiation/matter cosmological model allowing for a
successful unification scheme. The same interaction term that gives rise to the
inflaton decay accounts for the late time re-generation of phi. We present a
simple model where the strength of the g and h couplings are set by the
inflation scale E_I with g=h^2 propto E_I/m_Pl giving a reheating scale E_RH
propto E_I=100TeV and phi-generation scale E_gen propto E_I^2/m_pl=eV << E_RH.

with numerical simulations. Our results show that accretion onto compact
objects with Kerr parameter (characterizing the spin) $|a| < M$ and $|a| > M$
is very different. In the super-spinning case, for $|a|$ moderately larger than
$M$, the accretion onto the central object is extremely suppressed due to a
repulsive force at short distance. The accreting matter cannot reach the
central object, but instead is accumulated around it, forming a high density
cloud that continues to grow. The radiation emitted in the accretion process
will be harder and more intense than the one coming from standard black holes;
e.g. $\gamma$-rays could be produced as seen in some observations.
Gravitational collapse of this cloud might even give rise to violent bursts. As
$|a|$ increases, a larger amount of accreting matter reaches the central object
and the growth of the cloud becomes less efficient. Our simulations find that a
quasi-steady state of the accretion process exists for $|a|/M \gtrsim 1.4$,
independently of the mass accretion rate at large radii. For such high values
of the Kerr parameter, the accreting matter forms a thin disk at very small
radii. We provide some analytical arguments to strengthen the numerical
results; in particular, we estimate the radius where the gravitational force
changes from attractive to repulsive and the critical value $|a|/M \approx 1.4$
separating the two qualitatively different regimes of accretion. We briefly
discuss the observational signatures which could be used to look for such
exotic objects in the Galaxy and/or in the Universe.

substantial broadening in the strong-coupling limit. The behavior of the
electron transfer through these systems becomes much more clearly visible from
our study of current-voltage ($I$-$V$) characteristics. In this context we also
describe the noise power of current fluctuations ($S$) and determine the Fano
factor ($F$) which provides an important information about the electron
correlation among the charge carriers. Finally, we explore a novel transport
phenomenon by studying the surface disorder effect in which the current
amplitude increases with the increase of the surface disorder strength in the
strong disorder regime, while, the amplitude decreases in the limit of weak
disorder. Such an anomalous behavior is completely opposite to that of bulk
disordered system where the current amplitude always decreases with the

been proposed, which efficiently clustered sparsely related data by passing
messages between data points. However, we want to cluster large scale data
where the similarities are not sparse in many cases. This paper presents two
variants of AP for grouping large scale data with a dense similarity matrix.
The local approach is partition affinity propagation (PAP) and the global
method is landmark affinity propagation (LAP). PAP passes messages in the
subsets of data first and then merges them as the number of initial step of
iterations; it can effectively reduce the number of iterations of clustering.
LAP passes messages between the landmark data points first and then clusters
non-landmark data points; it is a large global approximation method to speed up
clustering. Experiments are conducted on many datasets, such as random data

is well studied. However, the statistical properties of maximum likelihood
estimates of parameters under these models are not well understood. Under each
of these models there is a point in data space which carries the strongest
possible signal for selection, yet, at this point, the likelihood is unbounded.
This result remains valid even if all of the mutation parameters are assumed to
be known. Therefore, standard simulation approaches used to approximate the

unstable results in the presence of substantial selection. We describe the
Bayesian alternative where the posterior distribution tends to produce more

Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM), and with the atom-mode in the second waveguide via
evanescent wave. We present the Hamiltonian for the system and deduce the exact

second-order correlation function. In contrast to the conventional linear
coupler, the atomic quantum coupler is able to generate nonclassical effects.
The atomic inversions can exhibit long revival-collapse phenomenon as well as
subsidiary revivals based on the competition among the switching mechanisms in
the system. Finally, under certain conditions, the system can yield the results

observations represent discrete samples from a latent continuous-time
stochastic process. The continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) is one such
generative model whose popularity extends to a variety of disciplines ranging
from computational finance to human genetics and genomics. A common theme among
these diverse applications is the need to simulate sample paths of a CTMC
conditional on realized data that is discretely observed. Here we present a
general solution to this sampling problem when the CTMC is defined on a
discrete and finite state space. Specifically, we consider the generation of
sample paths, including intermediate states and times of transition, from a
CTMC whose beginning and ending states are known across a time interval of
length $T$. We first unify the literature through a discussion of the three
predominant approaches: (1) modified rejection sampling, (2) direct sampling,
and (3) uniformization. We then give analytical results for the complexity and
efficiency of each method in terms of the instantaneous transition rate matrix
$Q$ of the CTMC, its beginning and ending states, and the length of sampling
time $T$. In doing so, we show that no method dominates the others across all
model specifications, and we give explicit proof of which method prevails for
any given $Q,T,$ and endpoints. Finally, we introduce and compare three
applications of CTMCs to demonstrate the pitfalls of choosing an inefficient
sampler.

multi-cell coordination in cellular networks as well as spectrum sharing in
cognitive radio networks among others. We consider a beamforming design
framework based on striking a compromise between beamforming gain at the
intended receiver (Egoism) and the mitigation of interference created towards
other receivers (Altruism). Combining egoistic and altruistic beamforming has
been shown previously in several papers to be instrumental to optimizing the
rates in a multiple-input-single-output interference channel MISO-IC (i.e.
where receivers have no interference canceling capability). Here, by using the
framework of Bayesian games, we shed more light on these game-theoretic
concepts in the more general context of MIMO channels and more particularly
when coordinating parties only have channel state information (CSI) of channels
that they can measure directly. This allows us to derive distributed
beamforming techniques. We draw parallels with existing work on the MIMO-IC,
including rate-optimizing and interference-alignment precoding techniques,
showing how such techniques may be improved or re-interpreted through a common
prism based on balancing egoistic and altruistic beamforming. Our analysis and
simulations currently limited to single stream transmission per user attest the
improvements over known interference alignment based methods in terms of sum
rate performance in the case of so-called asymmetric networks.

causes Y or Y causes X for just two observed variables X and Y. It is based on
the observation that there exist (non-Gaussian) joint distributions P(X,Y) for
which Y may be written as a function of X up to an additive noise term that is
independent of X and no such model exists from Y to X. Whenever this is the
case, one prefers the causal model X--> Y.
  Here we justify this method by showing that the causal hypothesis Y--> X is
unlikely because it requires a specific tuning between P(Y) and P(X|Y) to
generate a distribution that admits an additive noise model from X to Y. To
quantify the amount of tuning required we derive lower bounds on the
algorithmic information shared by P(Y) and P(X|Y). This way, our justification
is consistent with recent approaches for using algorithmic information theory
for causal reasoning. We extend this principle to the case where P(X,Y) almost
admits an additive noise model.
  Our results suggest that the above conclusion is more reliable if the
complexity of P(Y) is high.

concurrent model of structure of the low-temperature phase. In the
high-temperature phase, severe anisotropy of thermal motion of the major part
of the oxygen atoms was observed. This anisotropic motion turns to be quenched
as the sample is cooled below Ts. The variation of quadrupole splitting near Ts
is not similar to a steplike anomaly frequently seen at the charge-ordering
transition. We observe instead a dip-like anomaly of the average quadrupole
splitting near Ts. Narrow distribution of the electric field gradient (EFG)
over different cobalt sites is observed and explained on the basis of
point-charge model. XAFS spectra show no evidence of significant difference
between YBaCo4O7 (T > Ts) and HoBaCo4O7 (T < Ts). The origin of the transition
at Ts is ascribed to the condensation of the libration phonon mode associated
with the rigid-body rotational movements of the starlike tetrahedral units, the
building blocks of kagome network. It is shown that the condensation of the
libration mode is not compatible with translation symmetry for the hexagonal
S.G., but compatible for the orthorhombic S.G. The orthorhombic lattice
parameters and EFG components (Vxx, Vyy, Vzz) vary smoothly with temperature at
approaching Ts and closely follow each other.

position of the centroid of the 20-200 keV emission from the Crab region.
Methods. We find that the astrometry of the IBIS telescope is affected by the
temperature of the IBIS mask during the observation. After correcting for this
effect, we show that the systematic errors in the astrometry of the telescope
are of the order of 0.5 arcsec. In the case of the Crab nebula and several
other bright sources, the very large number of photons renders the level of
statistical uncertainty in the centroid smaller or comparable to this value.
Results. We find that the centroid of the Crab nebula in hard X-rays (20-40
keV) is shifted by 8.0 arcsec with respect to the Crab pulsar in the direction
of the X-ray centroid of the nebula. A similar shift is also found at higher
energies (40-100 and 100-200 keV). We observe a trend of decreasing shift with
energy, which can be explained by an increase in the pulsed fraction. To
differentiate between the contribution of the pulsar and the nebula, we divide
our data into an on-pulse and off-pulse sample. Surprisingly, the nebular
emission (i.e., off-pulse) is located significantly away from the X-ray
centroid of the nebula. Conclusions. In all 3 energy bands (20-40, 40-100, and
100-200 keV), we find that the centroid of the nebula is significantly offset
from the predicted position. We interpret this shift in terms of a cut-off in
the electron spectrum in the outer regions of the nebula, which is probably the
origin of the observed spectral break around 100 keV. From a simple
spherically-symmetric model for the nebula, we estimate that the electrons in
the external regions of the torus (d ~ 0.35 pc from the pulsar) reach a maximal
energy slightly below 10^14 eV.

story of closure is told in such a way that one should enduringly forget any
improper undertone of ""uncontrolled approximation"" or ""necessary evil"" which
might arise, for example, in reducing a diffusion equation in configuration
space to moment equations. In its widest sense, closure is associated with the
search for self-contained levels of description on which time-evolution
equations can be formulated in a closed, or autonomous, form. Proper closure
requires the identification of the relevant structural variables participating
in the dominant processes in a system of interest, and closure hence is
synonymous with focusing on the essence of a problem and consequently with deep
understanding. The derivation of closed equations may or may not be accompanied
by the elimination of fast processes in favor of dissipation. As a general
requirement, any closed set of evolution equations should be thermodynamically
admissible. Thermodynamic admissibility comprises much more than the second law
of thermodynamics, most notably, a clear separation of reversible and
irreversible effects and a profound geometric structure of the reversible terms
as a hallmark of reversibility. We discuss some implications of the intimate
relationship between nonequilibrium thermodynamics and the principles of
closure for rheology, and we illustrate the abstract ideas for the rod model of

allows for stronger pumping of the epilayer, which results in a shift of the

its metal abundance and the total mass of the system using imaging data with
HST/ACS (i775 and z850 bands) and VLT/ISAAC (J and K_s bands), extensive
spectroscopic data obtained with VLT/FORS2, and deep Chandra observations. Out
of a total sample of 34 spectroscopically confirmed cluster members, we
selected 16 passive galaxies within the central 2' (or 1 Mpc) with ACS
coverage, and inferred star formation histories for a sub-sample of galaxies
inside and outside the core by modeling their spectro-photometric data with
spectral synthesis models, finding a strong mean age radial gradient. Chandra
data show a regular elongated morphology, closely resembling the distribution
of core galaxies, with a significant cool core. We measure a global X-ray
temperature of kT=8.6(-1.2,+1.3) keV (68% c.l.). By detecting the rest-frame
6.7 keV Iron K line, we measure a metallicty Z= 0.26(+0.20,-0.16) Zsun. In the
likely hypothesis of hydrostatic equilibrium, we obtain a total mass of Mtot(<1
Mpc)=(5.9+-1.3)10^14 Msun. Overall, our analysis implies that XMM2235 is the
hottest and most massive bona-fide cluster discovered to date at z>1, with a
baryonic content, both its galaxy population and intra-cluster gas, in a
significantly advanced evolutionary stage at 1/3 of the current age of the

Till now high availability was achieved by host per host redundancy, a highly
expensive method in terms of hardware and human costs. A new approach to the
problem can be offered by virtualization. Using virtualization, it is possible
to achieve a redundancy system for all the services running on a data center.
This new approach to high availability allows to share the running virtual
machines over the servers up and running, by exploiting the features of the
virtualization layer: start, stop and move virtual machines between physical
hosts. The system (3RC) is based on a finite state machine with hysteresis,
providing the possibility to restart each virtual machine over any physical
host, or reinstall it from scratch. A complete infrastructure has been
developed to install operating system and middleware in a few minutes. To
virtualize the main servers of a data center, a new procedure has been
developed to migrate physical to virtual hosts. The whole Grid data center
SNS-PISA is running at the moment in virtual environment under the high
availability system. As extension of the 3RC architecture, several storage
solutions have been tested to store and centralize all the virtual disks, from
NAS to SAN, to grant data safety and access from everywhere. Exploiting
virtualization and ability to automatically reinstall a host, we provide a sort
of host on-demand, where the action on a virtual machine is performed only when
a disaster occurs.

up to an integer translation and/or rotation, to one of these classes. We then
show that each such tetrahedron can be completed to a cube with integer

uncertain. Within the framework of a slim alpha disk, we have constructed
global solutions of the rotating, viscous hot accretion flow and determined its

resembles the spherical Bondi flow and its mass accretion rate approaches the
Bondi accretion rate for the same density and temperature at the outer

hot accretion disk with advection, but its mass accretion rate can be
significantly smaller than the Bondi accretion rate with the same boundary
conditions. We also find that when the temperature at the outer boundary is
equal to the virial temperature, solutions exist only for 0.05 ~< mdot ~< 1
when alpha=0.01 where mdot==Mdot/Mdot_B. We also find that the dimensionless
mass accretion rate is roughly independent of the radius of the outer boundary

(2007)) have suggested that the arginine-rich HIV Tat peptides might be able to
translocate by destabilizing and inducing transient pores in phospholipid
bilayers. In this pathway for peptide translocation, arginine residues play a
fundamental role not only in the binding of the peptide to the surface of the
membrane but also in the destabilization and nucleation of transient pores
across the bilayer, despite being charged and highly hydrophilic. Here we
present a molecular dynamics simulation of a peptide composed of nine arginines
(Arg-9) that shows that this peptide follows the same translocation pathway
previously found for the Tat peptide. We test this hypothesis experimentally by
measuring ionic currents across phospholipid bilayers and cell membranes
through the pores induced by Arg-9 peptides. We find that Arg-9 peptides, in
the presence of an electrostatic potential gradient, induce ionic currents
across planar phospholipid bilayers, as well as in cultured osteosarcoma cells
and human smooth muscle cells freshly isolated from the umbilical artery. Our
results suggest that the mechanism of action of Arg-9 peptide involves the
creation of transient pores in lipid bilayers and cell membranes.

compensates the transverse applied field. This interpretation is further
supported by the measurement of actual electron Zeeman splitting which exhibits
an abrupt increase at the Hanle curve collapse. Strong inhomogeneous

that quantum communication over an isotropic medium, as opposed to classical

the medium's capacity for quantum communication can be characterized in terms

disagree with the calculations.The absence of contribution from the $\Delta$

certain setting parameters of the numerical control unit have a significant
impact on the value of the feed rate. Consequently, a kinematic model for a
circular-interpolated trajectory was developed on the basis of these
parameters. Moreover, the link between part accuracy and kinematic machine tool
behaviour was established. The kinematic model was ultimately validated on a
bore machining simulation.

So-called Schr\""odinger solitons are defined as a class of special solutions to
the Schr\""odinger flow equation from a Riemannian manifold or a Lorentzian
manifold $M$ into a K\""ahler manifold $N$. If the target manifold $N$ admits a
Killing potential, then the Schr\""odinger soliton is just a harmonic map with
potential from $M$ into $N$. Especially, if the domain manifold is a Lorentzian
manifold, the Schr\""odinger soliton is a wave map with potential into $N$. Then
we apply the geometric energy method to this wave map system, and obtain the
local well-posedness of the corresponding Cauchy problem as well as global
existence in 1+1 dimension. As an application, we obtain the existence of
Schr\""odinger soliton of the hyperbolic Ishimori system.

estimating tool path quality. First we perform experiments on HSM machine tool

the IRAM-PdB interferometer in the translucent environment of two low-mass
dense cores. The large size of the mosaic compared to the resolution (4 arcsec)
is unprecedented in the study of the small-scale structure of diffuse molecular
gas. Eight weak and elongated structures of thicknesses as small as 3 mpc (600
AU) and lengths up to 70mpc are found. These are not filaments because once
merged with short-spacing data, they appear as the sharp edges of larger-scale
structures. Six out of eight form quasi-parallel pairs at different velocities
and different position angles. This cannot be the result of chance alignment.
The velocity-shears estimated for the three pairs include the highest ever
measured far from star forming regions (780 km/s/pc). Because the large scale
structures have sharp edges, with little or no overlap, they have to be thin
CO-layers. Their edges mark a sharp transition between a CO-rich component and
a gas undetected in the CO line because of its low CO abundance, presumably the
cold neutral medium. We propose that these sharp edges are the first
directly-detected manifestations of the intermittency of interstellar
turbulence. The large velocity-shears reveal an intense straining field,
responsible for a local dissipation rate several orders of magnitude above
average, possibly at the origin of the thin CO-layers.
