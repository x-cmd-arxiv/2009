systems for which the system-plus-reservoir approach is not relevant. We first
analyze the fact that equilibrium thermodynamics may reveal the existence of an
underlying dynamics. This is true in the algebraic approach of quantum
mechanics via the Tomita-Takesaki theorem. A similar result is obtained if we
start from the path integral expression of the partition function, an equation
of motion is introduced. In both cases a parameter has to be identified with
the physical time. Several arguments are presented showing that it is so. By
investigating the dynamics for short times we introduce an equilibrium
condition from which a natural unit of time appears. The equation of motion is
extended to non equilibrium situations for which a H-theorem can be derived.
The equation of motion can be transformed into a quantum Smoluchovski equation,
its solution is a probability having a clear physical meaning. The relaxation
of this probability towards its equilibrium value requires a time during which
a thermodynamic description is possible or not. A standard bistable model is
investigated and the chemical rate $k(t)$ is calculated as a function of time,
it appears to be a non monotonic function of time. In some conditions the
stationary value of $k(t)$ can be identified with the Kramers result. Finally
we compare our approach which is naturally irreversible with an analysis based
on the Schr\""{o}dinger equation which is reversible. From all these results it
appears that our equation of motion or its Smoluchovski version appear as a
realistic starting point for describing quantum dissipation in small systems.

with main motivation to probe the deuteron at small internucleon distances.
Such studies are associated with the probing of high momentum component of the
deuteron wave function. For this, two main theoretical issues have been
addressed such as electromagnetic interaction of the virtual photon with the
bound nucleon and the strong interaction of produced baryons in the final state
of the break-up reaction. Within virtual nucleon approximation we developed a
new prescription to account for the bound nucleon effects in electromagnetic
interaction. The final state interaction at high $Q^2$ kinematics is calculated
within generalized eikonal approximation (GEA). We studied the uncertainties
involved in the calculation and performed comparisons with the first
experimental data on deuteron electrodisintegration at large $Q^2$. We
demonstrate that the experimental data confirm GEA's early prediction that the
rescattering is maximal at $\sim 70^0$ of recoil nucleon production relative to
the momentum of the virtual photon. Comparisons also show that the forward
recoil nucleon angles are best suited for studies of the electromagnetic
interaction of bound nucleons and the high momentum structure of the deuteron.
Backward recoil angle kinematics show sizable effects due to the
$\Delta$-isobar contribution. The latter indicates the importance of further
development of GEA to account for the inelastic transitions in the intermediate
state of the electrodisintegration reactions.

fraction of massive and merging galaxy clusters. Radio halos provide one of the
most important pieces of evidence for non-thermal components in large scale
structure. Statistics of their properties can be used to discriminate among
various models for their origin. Therefore, theoretical predictions of the
occurrence of radio halos are important as several new radio telescopes are
about to begin to survey the sky at low frequencies with unprecedented
sensitivity. In this paper we carry out Monte Carlo simulations to model the
formation and evolution of radio halos in a cosmological framework. We extend
previous works on the statistical properties of radio halos in the context of
the turbulent re-acceleration model. First we compute the fraction of galaxy
clusters that show radio halos and derive the luminosity function of radio
halos. Then, we derive differential and integrated number count distributions
of radio halos at low radio frequencies with the main goal to explore the
potential of the upcoming LOFAR surveys. By restricting to the case of clusters
at redshifts <0.6, we find that the planned LOFAR all sky survey at 120 MHz is
expected to detect about 350 giant radio halos. About half of these halos have
spectral indices larger than 1.9 and substantially brighten at lower
frequencies. If detected they will allow for a confirmation that turbulence
accelerates the emitting particles. We expect that also commissioning surveys,
such as MSSS, have the potential to detect about 60 radio halos in clusters of
the ROSAT Brightest Cluster Sample and its extension (eBCS). These surveys will
allow us to constrain how the rate of formation of radio halos in these

Many organizations use the Internet and particularly the World Wide Web as
their primary medium for communication and business. This phenomenal growth has
dramatically increased the performance requirements for the Internet. To have a
high performance Internet, a good congestion control system is essential for
it. The current work proposes that the congestion control in the Internet can
be inspired from the population control tactics of the nature. Toward this
idea, each flow (W) in the network is viewed as a species whose population size
is congestion window size of the flow. By this assumption, congestion control
problem is redefined as population control of flow species. This paper defines
a three trophic food chain analogy in congestion control area, and gives a
ratio dependent model to control population size of W species within this plant
herbivore carnivorous food chain. Simulation results show that this model
achieves fair bandwidth allocation, high utilization and small queue size. It
does not maintain any per flow state in routers and have few computational
loads per packet, which makes it scalable.

purposes and research areas. One of the important issues to apply intelligent
multi agent systems in real world and virtual environment is to develop a
framework that support machine learning model to reflect the whole complexity
of the real world. In this paper, we proposed a framework of intelligent agent
based neural network classification model to solve the problem of gap between
two applicable flows of intelligent multi agent technology and learning model
from real environment. We consider the new Supervised Multilayers Feed Forward
Neural Network (SMFFNN) model as an intelligent classification for learning
model in the framework. The framework earns the information from the respective
environment and its behavior can be recognized by the weights. Therefore, the
SMFFNN model that lies in the framework will give more benefits in finding the
suitable information and the real weights from the environment which result for
better recognition. The framework is applicable to different domains
successfully and for the potential case study, the clinical organization and
its domain is considered for the proposed framework

ZGRs in terms of coupled chains. We pursue these ideas further by introducing a
mapping between the ZGR model and the Hamiltonian for N-coupled quantum chains
as described in terms of 2N Majorana fermions. The proposed mapping preserves
the dependence of ribbon properties on its width thus rendering metallic
ribbons for N odd and zero-gap semiconductor ribbons for N even. Furthermore,
it reveals a close connection between the low-energy properties of the ZGR
model and a continuous family of square lattice model Hamiltonians with similar
width-dependent properties that includes the $\pi-$flux and the trivial square
lattice models. As a further extension, we show that this new description makes
it possible to identify various aspects of the physics of graphene ribbons with
those predicted by models of quantum spin chains (QSCs).

rule is derived from the principle of maximizing the predictive information in

individually controlled, non-communicating segments. The comparison of the
results shows that maximizing the predictive information per wheel leads to a
higher coordinated behavior of the physically connected robots compared to a
maximization per robot. Another focus of this paper is the analysis of the
effect of the robot chain length on the overall behavior of the robots. It will
be shown that longer chains with less capable controllers outperform those of
shorter length and more complex controllers. The reason is found and discussed
in the information-geometric interpretation of the learning process.

order to ascertain the specific changes in bond distances which accompany
magnetic ordering transitions. The transition from paramagnetic to the
antiferromagetic (noncollinear) phase near ~70 K is dominated by changes in the
a-b plane Mn-Mn bond distances. The spin rotation transition near ~40 K
involves both Mn-Mn and nearest neighbor Ho-Mn interactions while the low
temperature transition below 10 K involves all interactions, Mn-Mn, Ho-Mn
(nearest and next nearest) and Ho-Ho correlations. These changes in bond
distances reveal strong spin-lattice coupling. The similarity in magnitude of
the change in J(Mn-Mn) and J(Ho-Mn) enhances the system frustration. The
structural changes are interpreted in terms of a model of competing spin order
and local structural distortions. Density functional calculations are used to
estimate the energies associated with ionic displacements. The calculations
also reveal asymmetric polarization of the charge density of Ho, O3 and O4
sites along the z-axis in the ferroelectric phase. This polarization
facilitates coupling between Ho atoms on neighboring planes normal to the

possible behavior due to Bourgain's embedding theorem. Such remarkable graph
families were previously known to exist due to a tour de force algebraic

insulating nitride analog of copper oxides. Based on full-potential band
structure calculations, we derive the relevant microscopic parameters, estimate
individual exchange couplings, and establish a realistic spin model of this
compound. The structure of CuNCN contains chains of edge-sharing CuN(4)
squares. As a surprise, in contrast to analogous [CuO(2)] chains in
""edge-sharing"" cuprates, the leading magnetic interactions J ~ 2500 K run
perpendicular to the structural [CuN(2)] chains via bridging NCN groups. The
resulting spin model of a uniform chain is in agreement with the experimentally
observed temperature-independent magnetic susceptibility below 300 K. The
nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor interactions along the structural
[CuN(2)] chains are J(1) ~ -500 K and J(2) ~ 100 K, respectively. Despite the
frustrating nature of J(1) and J(2), we assign the anomaly at 70 K to
long-range magnetic ordering, which is likely collinear with antiparallel and
parallel arrangement of spins along the 'c' and 'a' directions, respectively.
The pronounced one-dimensionality of the spin system should lead to a reduction
in the ordered moment and to a suppression of the transition anomaly in the
specific heat, thus impeding the experimental observation of the long-range
ordering. Our results suggest CuNCN as a promising material for ballistic heat
transport within spin chains, while the sizable bandwidth W ~ 3 eV may lead to
a metal-insulator transition and other exotic properties under high pressure.

There are M distributed players competing for N independent arms. Each arm,

parameter. At each time, each player chooses one arm to play without exchanging
observations or any information with other players. Players choosing the same
arm collide, and, depending on the collision model, either no one receives
reward or the colliding players share the reward in an arbitrary way. We show
that the minimum system regret of the decentralized MAB grows with time at the
same logarithmic order as in the centralized counterpart where players act
collectively as a single entity by exchanging observations and making decisions
jointly. A decentralized policy is constructed to achieve this optimal order
while ensuring fairness among players and without assuming any pre-agreement or
information exchange among players. Based on a Time Division Fair Sharing
(TDFS) of the M best arms, the proposed policy is constructed and its order
optimality is proven under a general reward model. Furthermore, the basic
structure of the TDFS policy can be used with any order-optimal single-player
policy to achieve order optimality in the decentralized setting. We also
establish a lower bound on the system regret growth rate for a general class of
decentralized polices, to which the proposed policy belongs. This problem finds
potential applications in cognitive radio networks, multi-channel communication

terms linked with each major type of structure and identify the corresponding
subsets of the Navier-Stokes equations that are easier to solve than the full
version. Each of these subsets applies to a domain in the flow field not a flow
regime. The traditional statistics of turbulence are shown to be not specific
to turbulent flow. In particular the Reynolds stresses, the probability density
function, the dissipation, the production and the energy spectrum are obtained
from one subset associated with unsteady ""laminar"" flow. The evidence also
indicates that the Kolmogorov scale does not represent an eddy size and more
importantly that it does not require the assumption of local isotropy.

of diffusion and convection simplifying the mathematical solution of subsets of

  theory","14 pages",,,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When, at the end of the year 1915, both Einstein and Hilbert arrived at what
were named the field equations of general relativity, both of them thought that
their fundamental achievement entailed, inter alia, the realisation of a theory
of gravitation whose underlying group was the group of general coordinate
transformations. This group theoretical property was believed by Einstein to be
a relevant one from a physical standpoint, because the general coordinates
allowed to introduce reference frames not limited to the inertial reference
frames that can be associated with the Minkowski coordinate systems, whose
transformation group was perceived to be restricted to the Poincar\'e group.
Two years later, however, Kretschmann published a paper in which the physical
relevance of the group theoretical achievement in the general relativity of
1915 was denied. For Kretschmann, since any theory, whatever its physical
content, can be rewritten in a generally covariant form, the group of general
coordinate transformations is physically irrelevant. This is not the case,
however, for the group of the infinitesimal motions that bring the metric field
in itself, namely, for the Killing group. This group is physically
characteristic of any given spacetime theory, since it accounts for the local
invariance properties of the considered manifold, i.e., for its ``relativity
postulate''. In the present chapter it is shown what are the consequences for
the physical interpretation of some of these solutions whose relativity
postulate is of intermediate content, when Kretschmann's standpoint is

for the X-ray band. A VHE gamma-ray signal was clearly detected with an average
flux above 200 GeV of ~20 % of the Crab Nebula flux, which indicates a low
state of source activity in this energy range. No significant variability has
been found during the campaign. The VHE gamma-ray spectrum can be described by
a simple power-law from 80 GeV to 2 TeV with a photon index of 2.8+/-0.1, which
corresponds to one of the steepest photon indices observed in this energy range
so far for this object. The X-ray spectrum covers a wide range from 0.6 to 40
keV, and is well described by a broken power law, with photon indices of
2.257+/-0.004 and 2.420+/-0.012 below and above the break energy of 3.24+/-0.13
keV. No apparent high-energy cut off is seen above the break energy. Although
an increase of the flux of about 50 % is observed in the X-ray band within the
observation, the data indicate a consistently low state of activity for this
source. Time-resolved spectra show an evidence for spectral hardening with a
flux level. A homogeneous one-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model can
adequately describe the SED from the X-ray to the VHE gamma-ray bands with a
magnetic field intensity B=0.313 G and a Doppler beaming factor delta = 20,
which are similar to the values in the past multiwavelength campaigns in high
states. Based on our SSC parameters derived for the low state, we are able to
reproduce the SED of the high state by just changing the Lorentz factor of the
electrons corresponding to the break energy in the primary electron spectrum.
This suggests that the variation of the injected electron population in the jet
is responsible for the observed low-high state variation of the SED.

type II/Ib with a massive progenitor, has an age of ~1600 yr and is at a
distance of ~1 kpc. It is in addition assumed that the CR

kind of core collapse SNR. The theory gives a consistent description for all
the existing observational data, including the non-detection of thermal X-rays
and the spatial correlation of the X-ray and gamma-ray emission in the remnant.
Specifically it is shown that an efficient production of nuclear CRs, leading
to strong shock modification and a large downstream magnetic field strength B_d
~140 mkG can reproduce in detail the observed synchrotron emission from radio
to X-ray frequencies together with the gamma-ray spectral characteristics as
observed by the H.E.S.S. telescopes. The calculations are consistent with RX

flow based entirely on the information theory. The average information loss
under a single step of Wilsonian RG transformation is evaluated as a
conditional entropy of the fast variables, which are integrated out, when the
slow ones are held fixed. Its positivity results in the monotonic decrease of
the informational entropy under renormalization. This, however, does not
necessarily imply the irreversibility of the RG flow, because the entropy
explicitly depends on the total number of degrees of freedom, which is reduced.
Only some size-independent additive part of the entropy could possibly provide
the required Lyapunov function. We also introduce a mutual information of fast
and slow variables as probably a more adequate quantity to represent the
changes in the system under renormalization and evaluate it for some simple
systems. It is shown that for certain real space decimation transformations the
positivity of the mutual information directly leads to the monotonic growth of
the entropy per lattice site along the RG flow and hence to its
irreversibility.

describing the rich set of interactions between objects of interest. Many
deterministic and probabilistic clustering methods have been developed to
analyze such structures. Given a network, almost all of them partition the
vertices into disjoint clusters, according to their connection profile.
However, recent studies have shown that these techniques were too restrictive
and that most of the existing networks contained overlapping clusters. To
tackle this issue, we present in this paper the Overlapping Stochastic Block
Model. Our approach allows the vertices to belong to multiple clusters, and, to
some extent, generalizes the well-known Stochastic Block Model [Nowicki and
Snijders (2001)]. We show that the model is generically identifiable within
classes of equivalence and we propose an approximate inference procedure, based
on global and local variational techniques. Using toy data sets as well as the
French Political Blogosphere network and the transcriptional network of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we compare our work with other approaches.

close to the glass transition in colloidal suspensions under steady shear using
mode coupling approximations. Starting point is the many-particle Smoluchowski
equation. Under shear, detailed balance is broken and the response functions in
the stationary state are smaller at long times than estimated from the
equilibrium FDT. An asymptotically constant relation connects response and
fluctuations during the shear driven decay, restoring the form of the FDT with,
however, a ratio different from the equilibrium one. At short times, the
equilibrium FDT holds. We follow two independent approaches whose results are
in qualitative agreement. To discuss the derived fluctuation dissipation
ratios, we show an exact reformulation of the susceptibility which contains not
the full Smoluchowski operator as in equilibrium, but only its well defined
Hermitian part. This Hermitian part can be interpreted as governing the
dynamics in the frame comoving with the probability current. We present a
simple toy model which illustrates the FDT violation in the sheared colloidal

network designing and engineering. It is, however, not a single objective
optimization process as perceived by most previous researches, i.e., to

with lowering its cost to be another important objective. These two objectives
are often contradictive in that optimizing one objective may deteriorate the
other. After a deep investigation of the impact that network topology, node
capability scheme and routing algorithm as well as their interplays have on the
two objectives, this letter presents a systematic approach to achieve a
cost-effective design by carefully choosing the three designing aspects. Only
when routing algorithm and node capability scheme are elegantly chosen can
BA-like scale-free networks have the potential of achieving good tradeoff
between the two objectives. Random networks, on the other hand, have the
built-in character for a cost-effective design, especially when other aspects

have been proposed which do not require a central authority and the users are
assumed to be routing their flows selfishly. The existence of Nash Equilibria,
congestion and the amount of inefficiency caused by this selfish routing is a
major concern in this field. A type of paradox in the selfish routing networks,
Braess' Paradox, first discovered by Braess, is a major contributor to
inefficiency. Several pricing mechanisms have also been provided which give a
game theoretical model between users(consumers) and ISPs ({Internet Service
Providers} or sellers) for the internet.
  We propose a novel pricing mechanism, based on real world Internet network
architecture, which reduces the severity of Braess' Paradox in selfish routing
game theoretic networks. It's a pricing mechanism between combinatorial users
and ISPs. We prove that Nash equilibria exists in this network and provide
bounds on inefficiency . We use graphical properties of internet to prove our
result. Several interesting extensions and future work have also been
discussed.

AND, and addition. This combination of operations was revealed later to be
insufficient for security. Then, Chien et al. proposed the SASI protocol [4]
with the aim of offering better security, by adding the bitwise rotation to the

design of ultralightweight protocols, although certain attacks have been
published against this scheme [5, 6, 7]. In 2008, a new protocol, named
Gossamer [8], was proposed that can be considered a further development of both
the UMAP family and SASI. Although no attacks have been published against
Gossamer, Lee et al. [9] have recently published an alternative scheme that is
highly reminiscent of SASI. In this paper, we show that Lee et al.'s scheme

depend explicitly on the limiting eigenvalue distribution of the unperturbed

correspond to very well known objects in free probability theory that linearize
non-commutative free additive and multiplicative convolution. Furthermore, we
uncover a phase transition phenomenon whereby the large matrix limit of the
extreme eigenvalues of the perturbed matrix differs from that of the original
matrix if and only if the eigenvalues of the perturbing matrix are above a
certain critical threshold. Square root decay of the eigenvalue density at the

calculated using shell model. The total decay rate shows decrease with
increasing temperature as the ground state population is depleted and
population of excited states with slower decay rates increases. The abundance

being transported from outer space to the earth by comets or meteorites and
these in turn interacting with compounds already cooked up in the earth's seas.
Several recent observations point to the fact that the amino acids brought out

Experiments in the laboratory however throw up equal numbers of lefthanded and
righthanded amino acids, what are called racemic mixtures. Not only would the
latest observations endorse this dual mode theory of the origin of life, but on
the other hand it would point to the key trigger for life processes itself.
This is because racemic mixtures are not optically active, unlike the handed or
chiral constituents. It is this activity of harnessing solar radiation and
converting it into chemical energy, and storing this in the sugar bonds, as in
photosynthesis, that characterizes life.

unclear. In this paper, by considering the effect of the instability of
accretion disk on the evolution of white dwarf (WD) binaries, we performed
binary evolution calculations for about 2400 close WD binaries, in which a
carbon--oxygen WD accretes material from a main-sequence star or a slightly
evolved subgiant star (WD + MS channel), or a red-giant star (WD + RG channel)
to increase its mass to the Chandrasekhar (Ch) mass limit. According to these
calculations, we mapped out the initial parameters for SNe Ia in the orbital
period--secondary mass ($\log P^{\rm i}-M^{\rm i}_2$) plane for various WD
masses for these two channels, respectively. We confirm that WDs in the WD + MS
channel with a mass as low as $0.61 M_\odot$ can accrete efficiently and reach
the Ch limit, while the lowest WD mass for the WD + RG channel is $1.0 \rm
M_\odot$. We have implemented these results in a binary population synthesis
study to obtain the SN Ia birthrates and the evolution of SN Ia birthrates with
time for both a constant star formation rate and a single starburst. We find
that the Galactic SN Ia birthrate from the WD + MS channel is $\sim$$1.8\times
10^{-3} {\rm yr}^{-1}$ according to our standard model, which is higher than
previous results. However, similar to previous studies, the birthrate from the
WD + RG channel is still low ($\sim$$3\times 10^{-5} {\rm yr}^{-1}$). We also
find that about one third of SNe Ia from the WD + MS channel and all SNe Ia
from the WD + RG channel can contribute to the old populations ($\ga$1 Gyr) of

nonperturbative in the shear strength and makes systematic use of both the
shearing coordinate transformation and the Galilean invariance of the linear
shear flow. The velocity fluctuations are assumed to have low magnetic Reynolds
number (Rm) but could have arbitrary fluid Reynolds number. The magnetic
fluctuations are determined to lowest order in Rm by explicit calculation of
the resistive Green's function for the linear shear flow. The mean
electromotive force is calculated and an integro-differential equation is
derived for the time evolution of the mean magnetic field. In this equation,
velocity fluctuations contribute to two different kinds of terms, the C and D
terms, in which first and second spatial derivatives of the mean magnetic
field, respectively, appear inside the spacetime integrals. The contribution of
the D terms is such that the time evolution of the cross-shear components of
the mean field do not depend on any other components excepting themselves.
Therefore, to lowest order in Rm but to all orders in the shear strength, the D
terms cannot give rise to a shear-current assisted dynamo effect. Casting the
integro-differential equation in Fourier space, we show that the normal modes
of the theory are a set of shearing waves, labelled by their sheared
wavevectors. The integral kernels are expressed in terms of the velocity
spectrum tensor, which is the fundamental quantity that needs to be specified

multivariate predictor variables, one is often faced with a tradeoff between
interpretability and high predictive accuracy. To give a classical example,
classification and regression trees are easy to understand and interpret. Tree
ensembles like Random Forests provide usually more accurate predictions. Yet
tree ensembles are also more difficult to analyze than single trees and are
often criticized, perhaps unfairly, as `black box' predictors. Node harvest is
trying to reconcile the two aims of interpretability and predictive accuracy by
combining positive aspects of trees and tree ensembles. Results are very sparse
and interpretable and predictive accuracy is extremely competitive, especially
for low signal-to-noise data. The procedure is simple: an initial set of a few
thousand nodes is generated randomly. If a new observation falls into just a
single node, its prediction is the mean response of all training observation
within this node, identical to a tree-like prediction. A new observation falls
typically into several nodes and its prediction is then the weighted average of
the mean responses across all these nodes. The only role of node harvest is to
`pick' the right nodes from the initial large ensemble of nodes by choosing
node weights, which amounts in the proposed algorithm to a quadratic
programming problem with linear inequality constraints. The solution is sparse
in the sense that only very few nodes are selected with a nonzero weight. This
sparsity is not explicitly enforced. Maybe surprisingly, it is not necessary to
select a tuning parameter for optimal predictive accuracy. Node harvest can
handle mixed data and missing values and is shown to be simple to interpret and
competitive in predictive accuracy on a variety of data sets.

steep-spectrum (CSS) quasar 3C147 (B0538+498) at 5 and 8.4GHz.
  Methods. By using multifrequency VLBA observations, we derived
milliarcsecond-resolution images of the total intensity, polarisation, and
rotation measure distributions, by combining our new observations with archival
data.
  Results. The source shows a one-sided structure, with a compact region, and a
component extending about 200 mas to the south-west. The compact region is
resolved into two main components with polarised emission, a complex rotation
measure distribution, and a magnetic field dominated by components
perpendicular to the source axis.
  Conclusions. By considering all the available data, we examine the possible
location of the core component, and discuss two possible interpretations of the
observed structure of this source: core-jet and lobe-hot spot. Further
observations to unambiguously determine the location of the core would help
distinguish between the two possibilities discussed here.

educational efficiency of a path simulator under fluoroscopic guidance applied
to sacroiliac joint percutaneous screw fixation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We
evaluated 23 surgeons' accuracy inserting a guide-wire in a human cadaver
experiment, following a pre-established procedure. These medical trainees were
defined in three prospective respects: novice or skilled; with or without
theoretical knowledge; with or without surgical procedure familiarity. Analysed
criteria for each tested surgeon included the number of intraoperative X-rays
taken in order to achieve the surgical procedure as well as an iatrogenic index
reflecting the surgeon's ability to detect any hazardous trajectory at the time
of performing said procedure. RESULTS: An average number of 13 X-rays was
required for wire implantation by the G1 group. G2 group, assisted by the
simulator use, required an average of 10 X-rays. A substantial difference was
especially observed within the novice sub-group (N), with an average of 12.75
X-rays for the G1 category and an average of 8.5 X-rays for the G2 category. As
far as the iatrogenic index is concerned, we were unable to observe any
significant difference between the groups.

fifth of the metal-poor ([Fe/H] ~< -2) population but their origin is not well

of carbon-rich material from a thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch
(TPAGB) primary star to a less massive main-sequence companion which is seen
today. Recent studies explore the possibility that an initial mass function
biased toward intermediate-mass stars is required to reproduce the observed
CEMP fraction in stars with metallicity [Fe/H] < -2.5. These models also
implicitly predict a large number of nitrogen-enhanced metal-poor (NEMP) stars
which is not seen. We investigate whether the observed CEMP and NEMP to
extremely metal-poor (EMP) ratios can be explained without invoking a change in
the initial mass function.
  We confirm earlier findings that with current detailed TPAGB models the large
observed CEMP fraction cannot be accounted for. We find that efficient third
dredge up in low-mass (less than 1.25Msun), low-metallicity stars may offer at
least a partial explanation to the large observed CEMP fraction while remaining
consistent with the small observed NEMP fraction.

field, which absorbs everything hitting it. In history, the black hole was
first discussed by Laplace under the Newton mechanics, whose event horizon
radius is the same as the Schwarzschild's solution of the Einstein's vacuum
field equations. If all those objects having such an event horizon radius but
different gravitational fields are called as black holes, then one can simulate
certain properties of the black holes using electromagnetic fields and
metamaterials due to the similar propagation behaviours of electromagnetic
waves in curved space and in inhomogeneous metamaterials. In a recent
theoretical work by Narimanov and Kildishev, an optical black hole has been
proposed based on metamaterials, in which the theoretical analysis and
numerical simulations showed that all electromagnetic waves hitting it are
trapped and absorbed. Here we report the first experimental demonstration of
such an electromagnetic black hole in the microwave frequencies. The proposed
black hole is composed of non-resonant and resonant metamaterial structures,
which can trap and absorb electromagnetic waves coming from all directions
spirally inwards without any reflections due to the local control of
electromagnetic fields and the event horizon corresponding to the device
boundary. It is shown that the absorption rate can reach 99% in the microwave
frequencies. We expect that the electromagnetic black hole could be used as the
thermal emitting source and to harvest the solar light.

generalizes the notion of hyperuniformity to include also two-phase random
heterogeneous media. Hyperuniform random media do not possess
infinite-wavelength volume fraction fluctuations, implying that the variance in
the local volume fraction in an observation window decays faster than the
reciprocal window volume as the window size increases. For microstructures of
impenetrable and penetrable spheres, we derive an upper bound on the asymptotic
coefficient governing local volume fraction fluctuations in terms of the
corresponding quantity describing the variance in the local number density
(i.e., number variance). Extensive calculations of the asymptotic number
variance coefficients are performed for a number of disordered (e.g.,
quasiperiodic tilings, classical stealth disordered ground states, and certain
determinantal point processes), quasicrystal, and ordered (e.g., Bravais and
non-Bravais periodic systems) hyperuniform structures in various Euclidean

metric characterizing the degree of hyperuniformity. We also present

with relays is proposed. We consider a scenario where multiple sources
communicate with a single destination with the help of a relay. The proposed
scheme can be regarded as of the decode-and-forward type. The relay decodes the
information from the sources and it properly combines and re-encodes them to
generate some extra redundancy, which is transmitted to the destination. The
amount of redundancy generated by the relay can simply be adjusted according to
requirements in terms of performance, throughput and/or power. At the
destination, decoding of the information of all sources is performed jointly
exploiting the redundancy provided by the relay in an iterative fashion. The
overall communication network can be viewed as a serially concatenated code.
The proposed distributed scheme achieves significant performance gains with
respect to the non-cooperation system, even for a very large number of users.
Furthermore, it presents a high flexibility in terms of code rate, block length
and number of users.

field dark energy (quintessence) and the dark matter on the two- point
correlation function. It is well known that this coupling shifts the turnover
scale as well as suppresses the amplitude of the matter power spectrum.
However, these effects are too small to be observed when we limit the coupling
strength to be consistent with observations. Since the coupling of quintessence
to baryons is strongly constrained, species dependent coupling may arise. This
results in a baryon bias that is dif- ferent from unity. Thus, we look over the
correlation function in this coupled model. We find that even the non-coupled
quintessence model gives the better fit to the correlation function compared to
the cosmo- logical constant model. We are also able to observe the enhancement
of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) peak due to the increasing bias factor
of baryon from this species dependent coupling. In order to avoid the damping
effect of the BAO signature in the matter power spectrum due to nonlinear
clustering, we consider the coupling effect on the BAO bump in the linear
regime. This provides an alternative method to constrain the coupling of dark
energy to dark matter.

correctly applicable to fractal structures only at the scale lengths from
several average distances between the galaxies, and up to (10-20)% of the
radius of the largest sphere that fits completely inside the sample domain.
Earlier the correlation methods were believed to be applicable up to the entire
radius of the sphere and the researchers did not take the above restriction
into account while finding the scale length corresponding to the transition to
a uniform distribution. When an empirical formula is applied for approximating
the radial distributions in the samples confined by the limiting apparent
magnitude, the deviation of the true radial distribution from the approximating
formula (but not the parameters of the best approximation) correlate with
fractal dimension. An analysis of the 2dF catalog yields a fractal dimension of
2.20 +-m 0.25 on scale lengths from 2 to 20 Mpc, whereas no conclusive
estimates can be derived by applying the conditional density method for larger
scales due to the inherent biases of the method. An analysis of the radial
distributions of galaxies in the 2dF and 6dF catalogs revealed significant
irregularities on scale lengths of up to 70 Mpc. The magnitudes and sizes of

We specialize to a particular form of the interaction lagrangian, parameterized
by a single coupling. We find that if we make reasonable guesses for the values
of the parameters of the effective theory, the kaons have a much smaller shear
viscosity than the superfluid phonons, but also a much shorter mean free path,
so they could easily provide the dominant contribution to the shear viscosity
