in the inner Galaxy with a similar spatial morphology to the microwave haze
observed by WMAP, supporting the synchrotron interpretation of the microwave
signal. Using spatial templates, we regress out pi0 gammas, as well as IC and
bremsstrahlung components associated with known soft-synchrotron counterparts.
We find a significant gamma-ray excess towards the Galactic center with a
spectrum that is significantly harder than other sky components and is most
consistent with IC from a hard population of electrons. The morphology and
spectrum are consistent with it being the IC counterpart to the electrons which
generate the microwave haze seen at WMAP frequencies. In addition, the implied
electron spectrum is hard; electrons accelerated in supernova shocks in the
disk which then diffuse a few kpc to the haze region would have a softer
spectrum. We describe the full sky Fermi maps used in this analysis and make
them available for download.

We explore several models in the case of a pulsar population or dark matter
annihilation as the source. These morphological signatures of these models are
small behind the WMAP Galactic mask, but are testable and constrain the source
models. We show that detailed measurements of the morphology may distinguish
between the pulsar and dark matter interpretations as well as differentiate
among different pulsar models and dark matter profile models individually.
Specifically, we find that a zero central density Galactic pulsar population
model is in tension with the observed WMAP haze. The Planck Observatory's
greater sensitivity and expected smaller Galactic mask should potentially
provide a robust signature of the WMAP haze as either a pulsar population or
the dark matter.

challenges in making these implementations efficient. The implementation is

wave function of a macroscopic system of decomposing into localized permanently
non-overlapping parts when it spreads over a macroscopic region. The typical
example of this phenomenon is the measurement process, in which the wave
function of the laboratory (quantum system + apparatus + environment)
decomposes into n parts, corresponding to the n outcomes of the measurement:
the parts are non-overlapping, because they represent a macroscopic pointer in
different positions, and they are permanently non-overlapping due to the
irreversible interaction with the environment. PSD is often mentioned in the
literature, but until now no formal definition or systematic study of this
phenomenon has been undertaken. The aim of this paper is to partially fill this
gap by giving a formal definition of PSD and studying its possible connection
with scattering theory. The predictive and explanatory powers of this
phenomenon are also discussed and compared with those of Bohmian mechanics.

ferromagnet, two quantum dots, and a superconductor connected in series. By
using the non-equilibrium Green's function approach, we have calculated the
electric current, the differential conductance and the transmittance for
energies within the superconductor gap. In this regime, the mechanism of charge
transmission is the Andreev reflection, which allows for a control of the
current through the ferromagnet polarization. We have also included interdot
and intradot interactions, and have analyzed their influence through a mean
field approximation. In the presence of interactions, Coulomb blockade tend to
localized the electrons at the double-dot system, leading to an asymmetric
pattern for the density of states at the dots, and thus reducing the
transmission probability through the device. In particular, for non-zero
polarization, the intradot interaction splits the spin degeneracy, reducing the
maximum value of the current due to different spin-up and spin-down densities
of states. Negative differential conductance (NDC) appears for some regions of
the voltage bias, as a result of the interplay of the Andreev scattering with
electronic correlations. By applying a gate voltage at the dots, one can tune
the effect, changing the voltage region where this novel phenomenon appears.
This mechanism to control the current may be of importance in technological
applications.

evidence for a nonvanishing cosmological constant (CC) term in the
gravitational field equations, the theoretical status of this quantity seems to
be lagging well behind the observational successes. It thus seems timely to
revisit some fundamental aspects of the CC term in Quantum Field Theory (QFT).
We emphasize that, in curved space-time, nothing a priori prevents this term
from potentially having a mild running behavior associated to quantum effects.
Remarkably, this could be the very origin of the dynamical nature of the Dark
Energy, in contrast to many other popular options considered in the literature.
In discussing this possibility, we also address some recent criticisms
concerning the possibility of such running. Our conclusion is that, while there
is no comprehensive proof of the CC running, there is no proof of the
non-running either. The problem can be solved only through a deeper
understanding of the vacuum contributions of massive quantum fields on a curved
spacetime background. We suggest that such investigations are at the heart of
one of the most important endeavors of fundamental theoretical cosmology in the
years to come.

  We consider the analogous problem for transient random walks in random

(conditioned on the environment $\omega$), the maximal displacement of the
random walk when conditioned to return to the origin at time $2n$ is no longer
necessarily of the order $\sqrt{n}$. If the environment is nestling (both
positive and negative local drifts exist) then the maximal displacement
conditioned on returning to the origin at time $2n$ is of order
$n^{\kappa/(\kappa+1)}$, where the constant $\kappa>0$ depends on the law on

non-nestling (only non-negative local drifts) then the maximal displacement

$n^{1-\varepsilon}$ and at most $n/(\ln n)^{2-\varepsilon}$ for any

fitted with multi-leaf collimators (MLC) -- i.e. centers which can perform
intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) -- is rotational delivery. In
rotational delivery, the beam is on while the gantry is rotating and the MLC
leaves are moving, thus treating the patient more efficiently (regarding time)
than in IMRT. A consideration that should be examined when evaluating this new
type of delivery method is the tradeoff between treatment plan quality and
delivery time: what do we sacrifice in terms of plan quality by guaranteeing a
2 minute delivery, for example? In this paper we examine this question by
studying a simplified 2D phantom where leaf and gantry motion are directly
included in the optimization model. We formulate the model as a linear mixed
integer program. Because of the difficulty in solving to optimality, we employ
additional models which allow us to trap the true optimal solution between
upper and lower bounds. The lower bound solutions reveal which beam directions
are most useful for treatment (i.e. where the gantry should slow down), and
this information is used to produce deliverable solutions close to the lower
bound solutions. For the phantom cases studied, we show that when time is not
an issue, IMRT solutions are optimal, but when allowable treatment time is
constrained sufficiently, rotational delivery is the preferred choice.

provides a natural and robust mechanism for both triplet and singlet Cooper
pairing to first order in the interaction strength. With a purely dipolar
interaction, the triplet $p_z$-like polar pairing is the most dominant. A
short-range attractive interaction can enhance the singlet pairing to be nearly
degenerate with the triplet pairing. We point out that these two pairing
channels can mix by developing a relative phase of $\pm\frac{\pi}{2}$, thus
spontaneously breaking time-reversal symmetry. We also suggest the possibility
of such mixing of triplet and singlet pairing in other systems.

cells, including energy transduction and building block biosynthesis. While
these are the best characterized networks in living systems, understanding
their evolutionary history and complex wiring constitutes one of the most
fascinating open questions in biology, intimately related to the enigma of
life's origin itself. Is the evolution of metabolism subject to general
principles, beyond the unpredictable accumulation of multiple historical
accidents? Here we search for such principles by applying to an artificial
chemical universe some of the methodologies developed for the study of genome
scale models of cellular metabolism. In particular, we use metabolic flux
constraint-based models to exhaustively search for artificial chemistry
pathways that can optimally perform an array of elementary metabolic functions.
Despite the simplicity of the model employed, we find that the ensuing pathways
display a surprisingly rich set of properties, including the existence of
autocatalytic cycles and hierarchical modules, the appearance of universally
preferable metabolites and reactions, and a logarithmic trend of pathway length
as a function of input/output molecule size. Some of these properties can be
derived analytically, borrowing methods previously used in cryptography. In
addition, by mapping biochemical networks onto a simplified carbon atom
reaction backbone, we find that several of the properties predicted by the
artificial chemistry model hold for real metabolic networks. These findings
suggest that optimality principles and arithmetic simplicity might lie beneath
some aspects of biochemical complexity.

luminosity indicators from the light curves and spectra of each burst,
including the lag time between low and high photon energy light curves, the
variability of the light curve, the peak energy of the spectrum, the number of
peaks in the light curve, and the minimum rise time of the peaks. These
luminosity indicators can each be related directly to the luminosity, and we
combine their independent luminosities into one weighted average. Then with our
combined luminosity value, the observed burst peak brightness, and the
concordance redshift-distance relation, we can derive the redshift for each
burst. In this paper, we test the accuracy of our method on 107 bursts with
known spectroscopic redshift. The reduced $\chi^2$ of our best redshifts
($z_{best}$) compared with known spectroscopic redshifts ($z_{spec}$) is 0.86,
and the average value of $log_{10}(z_{best}/z_{spec})$ is 0.01, with this
indicating that our error bars are good and our estimates are not biased. The
RMS scatter of $log_{10}(z_{best}/z_{spec})$ is 0.26. For Swift bursts measured
over a relatively narrow energy band, the uncertainty in determining the peak
energy is one of the main restrictions on our accuracy. Although the accuracy
of our $z_{best}$ values are not as good as that of spectroscopic redshifts, it
is very useful for demographic studies, as our sample is nearly complete and
the redshifts do not have the severe selection effects associated with optical
spectroscopy.

could expect from classical rotating fluid dynamics (e.g. Taylor-Proudman
theorem). Thermal coupling to the tachocline, baroclinic effects and
latitudinal transport of heat have been advocated to explain this peculiar
state of rotation. Aims: To test the validity of thermal wind balance in the
solar convection zone using helioseismic inversions for both the angular
velocity and fluctuations in entropy and temperature. Methods: Entropy and
temperature fluctuations obtained from 3-D hydrodynamical numerical simulations
of the solar convection zone are compared with solar profiles obtained from
helioseismic inversions. Results: The temperature and entropy fluctuations in
3-D numerical simulations have smaller amplitude in the bulk of the solar
convection zone than those found from seismic inversions. Seismic inversion
find variations of temperature from about 1 K at the surface up to 100 K at the
base of the convection zone while in 3-D simulations they are of order 10 K
throughout the convection zone up to 0.96 $R_{\odot}$. In 3-D simulations,
baroclinic effects are found to be important to tilt the isocontours of
$\Omega$ away from a cylindrical profile in most of the convection zone helped
by Reynolds and viscous stresses at some locations. By contrast the baroclinic
effect inverted by helioseismology are much larger than what is required to
yield the observed angular velocity profile. Conclusion: The solar convection
does not appear to be in strict thermal wind balance, Reynolds stresses must
play a dominant role in setting not only the equatorial acceleration but also
the observed conical angular velocity profile.

based on 5-year WMAP data and a significantly expanded X-ray cluster catalogue.
Our method probes the flow via measurements of the kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich
(SZ) effect produced by the hot gas in moving clusters. It computes the dipole
in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data at cluster pixels, which
preserves the SZ component while integrating down other contributions. Our
improved catalog of over 1,000 clusters enables us to further investigate
possible systematic effects and, thanks to a higher median cluster redshift,
allows us to measure the bulk flow to larger scales. We present a corrected
error treatment and demonstrate that the more X-ray luminous clusters, while
fewer in number, have much larger optical depth, resulting in a higher dipole
and thus a more accurate flow measurement. This results in the observed
correlation of the dipole derived at the aperture of zero monopole with the
monopole measured over the cluster central regions. This correlation is
expected if the dipole is produced by the SZ effect and cannot be caused by
unidentified systematics (or primary cosmic microwave background anisotropies).
We measure that the flow is consistent with approximately constant velocity out
to at least 800 Mpc. The significance of the measured signal peaks around 500
Mpc, most likely because the contribution from more distant clusters becomes
progressively more diluted by the WMAP beam. We can, however, at present not
rule out that these more distant clusters simply contribute less to the overall
motion.

have a negative answer if one takes its usual augmentation. On the other hand,
the usual assumptions are crucial in order to obtain the existence of regular

important results of the theory of stochastic processes which are generally

that the observed luminosity in the central parsec is too high to be explained
by a long-standing top-heavy IMF, considering the limited amount of mass
inferred from stellar kinematics in this region. In contrast, continuous star
formation over the Galaxy's lifetime following a canonical IMF results in a
mass-to-light ratio and a total mass of stellar black holes (SBHs) consistent
with the observations. Furthermore, these SBHs migrate towards the centre due
to dynamical friction, turning the cusp of visible stars into a core as
observed in the Galactic Centre. For the first time here we explain the
luminosity and dynamical mass of the central cluster and both the presence and
extent of the observed core, since the number of SBHs expected from a canonical
IMF is just enough to make up for the missing luminous mass. We conclude that
the Galactic Centre is consistent with the canonical IMF and do not suggest a
systematic variation as a result of the region's properties such as high
density, metallicity, strong tidal field etc.

restricts the sample to bluer, actively star forming systems, diminishing the
importance of the red sequence. Rising star formation rates are still required
to explain the colors of galaxies bluer than g-r < 0.3. We also demonstrate
that the colors of the bluest galaxies in our sample are dominated by emission
lines and that stellar population synthesis models alone (without emission
lines) are not adequate for reproducing many of the galaxy colors. These
emission lines produce large changes in the r-i colors but leave the g-r color

colors at low masses that may be the result of a change in the star formation

lifetime galaxy clusters undergo several mergers. Here we report on the
discovery of three diffuse radio sources in the periphery of Abell 2256, using
the GMRT.
  Aims: The aim of the observations was to search for diffuse ultra-steep
spectrum radio sources within the galaxy cluster Abell 2256.
  Methods: We have carried out GMRT 325 MHz radio continuum observations of
Abell 2256. V, R and I band images of the cluster were taken with the 4.2m WHT.
  Results: We have discovered three diffuse elongated radio sources located
about 1 Mpc from the cluster center. Two are located to the west of the cluster
center, and one to the southeast. The sources have a measured physical extent
of 170, 140 and 240 kpc, respectively. The two western sources are also visible
in deep low-resolution 115-165 MHz WSRT images, although they are blended into
a single source. For the combined emission of the blended source we find an
extreme spectral index of -2.05\pm 0.14 between 140 and 351 MHz. The extremely
steep spectral index suggests these two sources are most likely the result of
adiabatic compression of fossil radio plasma due to merger shocks.
  Conclusions: The discovery of the steep spectrum sources implies the
existence of a population of faint diffuse radio sources in (merging) clusters
with such steep spectra that they have gone unnoticed in higher frequency
(\gtrsim 1 GHz) observations. An exciting possibility therefore is that such
sources will determine the general appearance of clusters in low-frequency high
resolution radio maps as will be produced by for example LOFAR or LWA.

formation and becoming dEs through passive evolution. We also find that all,

supported and are all situated in the inner regions of the cluster. This
suggests a different evolution from the rotationally supported systems. Three
different scenarios for these non-rotating galaxies are discussed (in situ

Spectral Energy Distributions. We derive an estimate of black hole masses
through the analysis of the broad Mg II emission lines observed in the
medium-resolution spectra taken with VIMOS/VLT as part of the zCOSMOS project.
We found that, as compared to the local value, the average black hole to host
galaxy mass ratio appears to evolve positively with redshift, with a best fit
evolution of the form (1+z)^{0.68 \pm0.12 +0.6 -0.3}, where the large
asymmetric systematic errors stem from the uncertainties in the choice of IMF,
in the calibration of the virial relation used to estimate BH masses and in the
mean QSO SED adopted. A thorough analysis of observational biases induced by
intrinsic scatter in the scaling relations reinforces the conclusion that an
evolution of the MBH-M* relation must ensue for actively growing black holes at
early times: either its overall normalization, or its intrinsic scatter (or
both) appear to increase with redshift. This can be interpreted as signature of
either a more rapid growth of supermassive black holes at high redshift, a
change of structural properties of AGN hosts at earlier times, or a significant
mismatch between the typical growth times of nuclear black holes and host

on median likelihoods derived from a Monte Carlo library of 50,000 stellar
population synthesis models that include dust and updated TP-AGB phase

analyze 9 galaxies spanning a broad range of morphologies. Among the main
results, we find that: i) galaxies appear much smoother in stellar mass maps
than at any optical or NIR wavelength; ii) total stellar mass estimates based
on unresolved photometry are biased low with respect to the integral of
resolved stellar mass maps, by up to 40%, due to dust obscured regions being
under-represented in global colours; iii) within a galaxy, on local scales
colours correlate with surface stellar mass density; iv) the slope and
tightness of this correlation reflect/depend on the morphology of the galaxy.

> 2 events, so that a high-resolution estimate of the spatial distribution of
future large quakes is obtained from the locations of the numerous small
events. We employ an adaptive spatial kernel of optimized bandwidth and assume
a universal, tapered Gutenberg-Richter distribution. In retrospective tests, we
show that no Poisson forecast could capture the observed variability. We
therefore also test forecasts using a negative binomial distribution for the
number of events. We modify existing likelihood-based tests to better evaluate
the spatial forecast. Our time-dependent model, an Epidemic Type Aftershock
Sequence (ETAS) model modified from Helmstetter et al. (2006), provides
next-day forecasts for m > 3.95. The forecasted rate is the sum of a background
rate, proportional to our time-independent model, and of the triggered events
due to all prior earthquakes. Each earthquake triggers events with a rate that
increases exponentially with its magnitude and decays in time according to
Omori's law. An isotropic kernel models the spatial density of aftershocks for
small (< 5.5) events. For larger quakes, we smooth early aftershocks to
forecast later events. We estimate parameters by optimizing retrospective
forecasts. Our short-term model realizes a gain of about 6.0 over the

important effects on cosmological structure formation. Within growing neutrino
models the coupling becomes effective only in recent times, when neutrinos
become non-relativistic, stopping the evolution of the cosmon. This can explain
why dark energy dominates the universe only in a rather recent epoch by
relating the present dark energy density to the small mass of neutrinos. Such
models predict the presence of stable neutrino lumps at supercluster scales
(~200 Mpc and bigger), caused by an attractive force between neutrinos which is
stronger than gravity and mediated by the cosmon. We present a method to follow
the initial non-linear formation of neutrino lumps in physical space, by
integrating numerically on a 3D grid non-linear evolution equations, until
virialization naturally occurs. As a first application, we show results for
cosmologies with final large neutrino average mass ~2 eV: in this case,
neutrino lumps indeed form and mimic very large cold dark matter structures,
with a typical gravitational potential 10^{-5} for a lump size ~10 Mpc, and
reaching larger values for lumps of about 200 Mpc. A rough estimate of the
cosmological gravitational potential at small k in the non-linear regime,
Phi_nu = 10^{-6} (k/k_0)^{-2}, 1.2x10^{-2} h/Mpc < k_0 < 7.8x10^{-2} h/Mpc,
turns out to be many orders of magnitude smaller than an extrapolation of the
linear evolution of density fluctuations. The size of the neutrino-induced
gravitational potential could modify the spectrum of CMB anisotropies for small
angular momenta.

leave a testable imprint on the higher-order correlations of the CMB and large
scale structures in the Universe. The effect is particularly pronounced if the
statistical non-Gaussianity is inherently large, such as in models of inflation
with a small speed of sound, e.g. DBI. First reviewing the motivations for a
modified vacuum, we calculate the non-Gaussianity for a general action with a
small speed of sound. The shape of its bispectrum is found to most resemble the
'orthogonal' or 'local' templates depending on the phase of the Bogolyubov
parameter. In particular, for DBI models of inflation the bispectrum can have a
profound 'local' template feature, in contrast to previous results. Determining
the projection into the observational templates allows us to derive constraints
on the absolute value of the Bogolyubov parameter. In the small sound speed
limit, the derived constraints are generally stronger than the existing
constraint derived from the power spectrum. The bound on the absolute value of
the Bogolyubov parameter ranges from the 10^-6 to the 10^-3 level for
H/\Lambda_c = 10^-3, depending on the specific details of the model, the sound
speed and the phase of the Bogolyubov parameter.

FLASH in two spatial dimensions and with an explicit shear viscosity. The
evolution of the central accretion rate exhibits phases reminiscent of the long
GRB gamma-ray and X-ray light curve, which lends support to the proposal that
the luminosity is modulated by the central accretion rate. After a few tens of
seconds, an accretion shock sweeps outward through the star. The formation and
outward expansion of the accretion shock is accompanied with a sudden and rapid
power-law decline in the central accretion rate Mdot ~ t^{-2.8}, which
resembles the L_X ~ t^{-3} decline observed in the X-ray light curves. The
collapsed, shock-heated stellar envelope settles into a thick, low-mass
equatorial disk embedded within a massive, pressure-supported atmosphere. After
a few hundred seconds, the inflow of low-angular-momentum material in the axial
funnel reverses into an outflow from the surface of the thick disk. Meanwhile,
the rapid decline of the accretion rate slows down, or even settles a in steady
state with Mdot ~ 5x10^{-5} Msun/s, which resembles the ""plateau"" phase in the
X-ray light curve. While the duration of the ""prompt"" phase depends on the
resolution in our simulations, we provide an analytical model taking into
account neutrino losses that estimates the duration to be ~20 s. The model
suggests that the steep decline in GRB X-ray light curves is triggered by the
circularization of the infalling stellar envelope at radii where the virial
temperature is below ~10^{10} K, such that neutrino cooling shuts off and an
outward expansion of the accretion shock becomes imminent.

that various mechanisms of excitation are at work simultaneously.

plays a central role in a multitude of practically important applications. A
particularly challenging instance of this problem occurs in the case when the
degradation phenomenon is modeled by an ill-conditioned operator. In such a
case, the presence of noise makes it impossible to recover a valuable
approximation of the image of interest without using some a priori information
about its properties. Such a priori information is essential for image
restoration, rendering it stable and robust to noise. Particularly, if the
original image is known to be a piecewise smooth function, one of the standard
priors used in this case is defined by the Rudin-Osher-Fatemi model, which
results in total variation (TV) based image restoration. The current arsenal of
algorithms for TV-based image restoration is vast. In the present paper, a
different approach to the solution of the problem is proposed based on the
method of iterative shrinkage (aka iterated thresholding). In the proposed
method, the TV-based image restoration is performed through a recursive
application of two simple procedures, viz. linear filtering and soft
thresholding. Therefore, the method can be identified as belonging to the group
of first-order algorithms which are efficient in dealing with images of
relatively large sizes. Another valuable feature of the proposed method
consists in its working directly with the TV functional, rather then with its
smoothed versions. Moreover, the method provides a single solution for both
isotropic and anisotropic definitions of the TV functional, thereby
establishing a useful connection between the two formulae.

and reduces errors on the mean, but also tightens the correlations: after
reconstruction, we recover a slope of near unity for the correlation between
the real and redshift space and restore a strong correlation between the low

with imaginary coupling has real eigenvalues. The proof consists of two steps.
In the first step, it is shown that for many PT-Invariant Hamiltonians, one can
define corresponding Hermitian Hamiltonians that have the same eigenvalues when
quantized using indefinite metric. The second step is to show that the
indefinite-metric eigenvalues of the Hermitian cubic oscillator are real since
the norms of its eigenstates do not vanish. The correspondence between
PT-Invariant Hamiltonians and indefinite-metric Hermitian Hamiltonians is
further discussed as a way to determine vacuum stability for certain

usage scenarios is characterized by a fading channel response that is
time-varying, location-sensitive, and uniquely shared by a given
transmitter-receiver pair. The complexity associated with a richly scattering
environment implies that the short-term fading process is inherently hard to
predict and best modeled stochastically, with rapid decorrelation properties in
space, time and frequency. In this paper, we demonstrate how the channel state
between a wireless transmitter and receiver can be used as the basis for
building practical secret key generation protocols between two entities. We
begin by presenting a scheme based on level crossings of the fading process,
which is well-suited for the Rayleigh and Rician fading models associated with
a richly scattering environment. Our level crossing algorithm is simple, and
incorporates a self-authenticating mechanism to prevent adversarial
manipulation of message exchanges during the protocol. Since the level crossing
algorithm is best suited for fading processes that exhibit symmetry in their
underlying distribution, we present a second and more powerful approach that is
suited for more general channel state distributions. This second approach is
motivated by observations from quantizing jointly Gaussian processes, but
exploits empirical measurements to set quantization boundaries and a heuristic
log likelihood ratio estimate to achieve an improved secret key generation
rate. We validate both proposed protocols through experimentations using a
customized 802.11a platform, and show for the typical WiFi channel that
reliable secret key establishment can be accomplished at rates on the order of
10 bits/second.

(FNS) was able to identify specific differences in the responses of each
organism. The high specificity of individual MEG responses manifested itself in
the values of FNS parameters for both chaotic and resonant components of the
original signal. The present study applies the FNS cross-correlation function
to the analysis of correlations between the MEG responses simultaneously
measured at spatially separated points of the human cortex processing the
red-blue flickering color stimulus. It is shown that the cross-correlations for
control (healthy) subjects are characterized by frequency and phase
synchronization at different points of the cortex, with the dynamics of
neuromagnetic responses being determined by the low-frequency processes that
correspond to normal physiological rhythms. But for the patient, the frequency
and phase synchronization breaks down, which is associated with the suppression
of cortical regulatory functions when the flickering-color stimulus is applied,
and higher frequencies start playing the dominating role. This suggests that
the disruption of correlations in the MEG responses is the indicator of
pathological changes leading to photosensitive epilepsy, which can be used for
developing a method of diagnosing the disease based on the analysis with the
FNS cross-correlation function.

from the line-widths and line-center shifts observed in Doppler-limited,
steady-state, linear absorption spectra near 675 nm as a function of buffer gas
pressure through a nonlinear regression analysis of observed line shapes
against a Gaussian-Lorentzian convolution line shape model.
  A line shape model, obtained from a first-order perturbation solution of the
time-dependent Schrodinger equation for randomly occurring interactions between
a two-level system and a buffer gas treated as step-function potentials,
reveals a relationship between the ratio of pressure broadening to pressure
shift coefficients and a change in the wave function phase-factor, interpreted
as reflecting the ""cause and effect"" of state-changing events in the
microscopic domain. Collision cross-sections determined from this model are
interpreted as reflecting the inelastic nature of collision-induced
state-changing events.
  A steady-state kinetic model for the two-level system compatible with the
Beer-Lambert law reveals thermodynamic constraints on the ensemble-average
state-changing rates and collision cross-sections, and leads to the proposal of
a relationship between observed asymmetric line shapes and irreversibility in
the microscopic domain, and suggests that such features may be more fully
consistent with the use of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians for describing the
state-changing process; in the context of the [non-degenerate] two-level model,
the Hamiltonian that describes photon absorption is not the Hermitian conjugate
of the Hamiltonian that describes photon emission.

So far, theoretical explanations for body-size patterns in periodic
population dynamics have received little attention. In particular, tuning and
testing of allometric models on empirical data and regressions has not been
carried out yet. Here, oscillations expected from a one-species (delayed
logistic) and a two-species (Rosenzweig-MacArthur) model were compared to
cycles observed in laboratory experiments and field surveys for a wide range of
invertebrates and vertebrates. The parameters in the equations were linked to
body mass, using a consistent set of allometric relationships that was
calibrated on 230 regressions. Oscillation period and amplitude predicted by
the models were validated with data taken from literature. Results. The
collected data showed that cycle times of herbivores scaled to species body
mass with a slope up to 1/4 as expected from the models. With exception of
aquatic herbi-detritivores, intercepts were observed at the level calculated by
the two-species model. Remarkably, oscillation periods were size-independent
for predatory invertebrates, fishes, birds and mammals. Average cycles were of
4 to 5 years, similar to those predicted by the one-species model with a
size-independent delay of 1 year. The consistent difference between herbivores
and the carnivores could be explained by the models from the small parameter
space for consumer-resource cycles in generalist predators. As expected,
amplitudes recorded in the field did not scale to size. Observed oscillation
periods were generally within a factor of about 2 from the values expected from
the models. This demonstrates that a set of slopes and intercepts for age and
density parameters applicable to a wide range of species allows a reasonable
estimate of independently measured cycle times.

there are also possible difference. For the LMC and SMC clusters the densities
are below the Galactic data points and/or the core radii are smaller than those

understanding of many quantum systems, including superfluid helium in porous
media, granular and thin-film superconductors, and light propagating in
disordered media. One central aspect for bosonic systems is the competition
between disorder, which tends to localize particles, and weak repulsive
interactions, which instead have a delocalizing effect. Since the required
degree of independent control of the disorder and of the interactions is not
easily achievable in most available physical systems, a systematic experimental
investigation of this competition has so far not been possible. Here we employ
an ultracold atomic Bose-Einstein condensate with tunable repulsive
interactions in a quasi-periodic lattice potential to study this interplay in
detail. We characterize the entire delocalization crossover through the study
of the average local shape of the wavefunction, the spatial correlations, and
the phase coherence. Three different regimes are identified and compared with
theoretical expectations: an exponentially localized Anderson glass, the
formation of locally coherent fragments, as well as a coherent, extended state.
Our results illuminate the role of weak repulsive interactions on disordered
bosonic systems and show that the system and the techniques we employ are
promising for further investigations of disordered systems with interactions,
also in the strongly correlated regime.

star, due to a mountain grown on a hard surface, approaches ~2e-4 for accreted
masses greater than ~1.2e-3 solar masses, and that sinking reduces the
ellipticity by between 25% and 60%. The consequences for gravitational
radiation from low-mass x-ray binaries are discussed.

and Saturn mass planet is very likely in a 3:2 mean motion resonance. The
standard scenario to form planetary commensurabilities is convergent migration
of two planets embedded in a protoplanetary disc. When the planets are
initially separated by a period ratio larger than two, convergent migration
will most likely lead to a very stable 2:1 resonance for moderate migration
rates. To avoid this fate, formation of the planets close enough to prevent
this resonance may be proposed. However, such a simultaneous formation of the
planets within a small annulus, seems to be very unlikely.
  Rapid type III migration of the outer planet crossing the 2:1 resonance is
one possible way around this problem. In this paper, we investigate this idea
in detail. We present an estimate for the required convergent migration rate
and confirm this with N-body and hydrodynamical simulations. If the dynamical
history of the planetary system had a phase of rapid inward migration that
forms a resonant configuration, we predict that the orbital parameters of the
two planets are always very similar and hence should show evidence of that.
  We use the orbital parameters from our simulation to calculate a radial
velocity curve and compare it to observations. Our model can explain the
observational data as good as the previously reported fit. The eccentricities
of both planets are considerably smaller and the libration pattern is
different. Within a few years, it will be possible to observe the planet-planet
interaction directly and thus distinguish between these different dynamical
states.

technology is the industrial purification against electro-negative impurities,
especially Oxygen and Nitrogen remnants, which have to be continuously kept at
an exceptionally low level by filtering and recirculating liquid Argon.
Improved purification techniques have been applied to a 120 liters LAr-TPC test
facility in the INFN-LNL laboratory. Through-going muon tracks have been used
to determine the free electron lifetime in liquid Argon against
electro-negative impurities. The short path length here observed (30 cm) is
compensated by the high accuracy in the observation of the specific ionization
of cosmic ray muons at sea level as a function of the drift distance. A free
electron lifetime of (21.4+7.3-4.3) ms, namely > 15.8 ms at 90 % C.L. has been
observed over several weeks under stable conditions, corresponding to a
residual Oxygen equivalent of about 15 ppt (part per trillion). At 500 V/cm,
the free electron speed is 1.5 m/ms. In a LAr-TPC a free electron lifetime in
excess of 15 ms corresponds for instance to an attenuation of less than 15 %
after a drift path of 5 m, opening the way to the operation of the LAr-TPC with
exceptionally long drift distances.

means of detailed thermal calculations of a disc in hydrostatic equilibrium
irradiated by EUV and X-ray radiation from the central source. Our models show
t_phot \propto Z^0.52 for a pure photoevaporation model. By means of analytical
estimates we derive instead a much stronger negative power dependance on
metallicity of the disc lifetime for a dispersal model based on planet
formation. A census of disc fractions in lower metallicity regions should
therefore be able to distinguish between the two models. A recent study by
Yasui et al. in low metallicity clusters of the extreme outer Galaxy ([O/H] ~-
0.7dex and dust to gas ratio of ~0.001) provides preliminary observational
evidence for shorter disc lifetimes at lower metallicities, in agreement with
the predictions of a pure photoevaporation model. [abridged] We finally develop
an analytical framework to study the effects of metallicity dependent
photoevaporation on the formation of gas giants in the core accretion scenario.
We show that accounting for this effect strengthens the conclusion that planet
formation is favoured at higher metallicity. [abridged]

are computed for such near-geodesic paths; it is shown that they traverse the

computed for a natural network flow. Comparisons are drawn with similar network

14.5h, on the celestial equator, with magnitude selections r < 19.4, z < 18.2
and K(AB) < 17.6 over all three regions, and r < 19.8 in the 12-h region. The
target density is 1080 per sq. deg. in the 12-h region and 720 per sq. deg. in
the other regions. The average GAMA target density and area are compared with
completed and ongoing galaxy redshift surveys. The GAMA survey implements a
highly complete star-galaxy separation that jointly uses an intensity-profile
separator (delta(sg) = r-band psf mag - model mag) as per the SDSS) and a
colour separator. The colour separator is defined as delta(sg,jk) = J - K -
f(g-i), where f(g-i) is a quadratic fit to the J-K colour of the stellar locus
over the range 0.3 < g-i < 2.3. All galaxy populations investigated are well
separated with delta(sg,jk) > 0.2. From two years out of a three-year AAOmega
program on the Anglo-Australian Telescope, we have obtained 79599 unique galaxy
redshifts. Previously known redshifts in the GAMA region bring the total up to
98497. The median galaxy redshift is 0.2 with 99% at z < 0.5. We present some
of the global statistical properties of the survey, including K-band galaxy

These conflicting requirements determine an asymptotic bound, which is a

relate the asymptotic bound to phase diagrams of quantum statistical mechanical
systems. We first identify the code parameters with Hausdorff and von Neumann
dimensions, by considering fractals consisting of infinite sequences of code
words. We then construct operator algebras associated to individual codes.
These are Toeplitz algebras with a time evolution for which the KMS state at
critical temperature gives the Hausdorff measure on the corresponding fractal.
We extend this construction to algebras associated to limit points of codes,
with non-uniform multi-fractal measures, and to tensor products over varying

destabilise the 2CK fixed points; and the critical fixed point is shown to
consist of a free pseudospin together with effective 1-channel spin quenching,

  Transactions on Signal Processing",,"10.1109/TSP.2010.2049997",,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper describes performance bounds for compressed sensing (CS) where the
underlying sparse or compressible (sparsely approximable) signal is a vector of
nonnegative intensities whose measurements are corrupted by Poisson noise. In
this setting, standard CS techniques cannot be applied directly for several
reasons. First, the usual signal-independent and/or bounded noise models do not
apply to Poisson noise, which is non-additive and signal-dependent. Second, the
CS matrices typically considered are not feasible in real optical systems
because they do not adhere to important constraints, such as nonnegativity and
photon flux preservation. Third, the typical $\ell_2$--$\ell_1$ minimization
leads to overfitting in the high-intensity regions and oversmoothing in the
low-intensity areas. In this paper, we describe how a feasible positivity- and
flux-preserving sensing matrix can be constructed, and then analyze the
performance of a CS reconstruction approach for Poisson data that minimizes an
objective function consisting of a negative Poisson log likelihood term and a
penalty term which measures signal sparsity. We show that, as the overall
intensity of the underlying signal increases, an upper bound on the
reconstruction error decays at an appropriate rate (depending on the
compressibility of the signal), but that for a fixed signal intensity, the
signal-dependent part of the error bound actually grows with the number of
measurements or sensors. This surprising fact is both proved theoretically and
justified based on physical intuition.

efficient data structures and, most notably, hash tables. Cuckoo hashing is a
technique that extends this concept. There,we are given a table with $n$
locations, and we assume that each location can hold one item. Each item to be
inserted chooses randomly k>1 locations and has to be placed in any one of
them. How much load can cuckoo hashing handle before collisions prevent the
successful assignment of the available items to the chosen locations? Practical
evaluations of this method have shown that one can allocate a number of
elements that is a large proportion of the size of the table, being very close
to 1 even for small values of k such as 4 or 5.
  In this paper we show that there is a critical value for this proportion:
with high probability, when the amount of available items is below this value,
then these can be allocated successfully, but when it exceeds this value, the
allocation becomes impossible. We give explicitly for each k>1 this critical
value. This answers an open question posed by Mitzenmacher (ESA '09) and
underpins theoretically the experimental results. Our proofs are based on the
translation of the question into a hypergraph setting, and the study of the
related typical properties of random k-uniform hypergraphs.
