function and halo bias on dark energy constraints from imminent galaxy cluster
surveys. We find that for an optical cluster survey like the Dark Energy
Survey, the accuracy required on the predicted halo mass function to make it an
insignificant source of error on dark energy parameters is ~ 1%. The analogous
requirement on the predicted halo bias is less stringent (~ 5%), particularly
if the observable-mass distribution can be well constrained by other means.
These requirements depend upon survey area but are relatively insensitive to
survey depth. The most stringent requirements are likely to come from a survey
over a significant fraction of the sky that aims to observe clusters down to
relatively low mass, Mth ~ 10^13.7 Msun/h; for such a survey, the mass function
and halo bias must be predicted to accuracies of ~ 0.5% and ~ 1%, respectively.
These accuracies represent a limit on the practical need to calibrate ever more
accurate halo mass and bias functions. We find that improving predictions for
the mass function in the low-redshift and low-mass regimes is the most
effective way to improve dark energy constraints.

lensing observations can be expressed as an integral over the underlying matter
power spectrum. This is true at second order in the gravitational potential. We
extend the standard calculation, constructing all corrections to fourth order
in the gravitational potential. There are four types of corrections:
corrections to the lensing shear due to multiple-deflections; corrections due
to the fact that shape distortions probe the reduced shear $\gamma/(1-\kappa)$
rather than the shear itself; corrections associated with the non-linear
conversion of reduced shear to mean ellipticity; and corrections due to the
fact that observational galaxy selection and shear measurement is based on
galaxy brightnesses and sizes which have been (de)magnified by lensing. We show
how the previously considered corrections to the shear power spectrum
correspond to terms in our analysis, and highlight new terms that were not
previously identified. All correction terms are given explicitly as integrals
over the matter power spectrum, bispectrum, and trispectrum, and are
numerically evaluated for the case of sources at z=1. We find agreement with
previous works for the ${\mathcal O}(\Phi^3)$ terms. We find that for ambitious
future surveys, the ${\mathcal O}(\Phi^4)$ terms affect the power spectrum at
the ~ 1-5 $\sigma$ level; they will thus need to be accounted for, but are
unlikely to represent a serious difficulty for weak lensing as a cosmological

a rare opportunity to test the validity of general relativity across
cosmological scales. However, modified gravity can be degenerate in its effect
with the unknown values of cosmological parameters. More seriously, even the
`observed' value of the RSD (redshift-space distortions) used to measure the
fluctuation growth rate depends on the assumed cosmological parameters (the
Alcock-Paczynski effect). We give a full analysis of these issues, showing how
to combine RSD with BAO (baryon acoustic oscillations) and CMB (Cosmic
Microwave Background) data, in order to obtain joint constraints on deviations
from general relativity and on the equation of state of dark energy whilst
allowing for factors such as non-zero curvature. In particular we note that the
evolution of Omega_m(z), along with the Alcock-Paczynski effect, produces a
degeneracy between the equation of state w and the modified growth parameter
gamma. Typically, the total marginalized error on either of these parameters
will be larger by a factor ~ 2 compared to the conditional error where one or
other is held fixed. We argue that future missions should be judged by their
Figure of Merit as defined in the w_p - gamma plane, and note that the
inclusion of spatial curvature can degrade this value by an order of magnitude.

for distance measures in cosmology. By contrast, the Cosmic Microwave
Background at z ~ 1100 acts as the point of reference for the growth of large
scale structure. As a result, we find there is a lack of synergy between growth
and distance measures. We show that when measuring the gravitational growth
index gamma using redshift-space distortions, typically 80% of the signal
corresponds to the local growth rate at the galaxy bin location, while the
remaining fraction is determined by its behaviour at higher redshifts.
  In order to clarify whether modified gravity may be responsible for the dark
energy phenomenon, the aim is to search for a modification to the growth of
structure. One might expect the magnitude of this deviation to be commensurate
with the apparent dark energy density Omega_Lambda(z). This provides an
incentive to study redshift-space distortions (RSD) at as low a redshift as is
practical. Specifically, we find the region around z = 0.5 offers the optimal
balance of available volume and signal strength.

stellar diameter, as well as significant changes in the limb darkening and
stellar inhomogeneities. Model fitting gave precise time-dependent values of
the stellar diameter, and reveals presence and displacement of a warm molecular
layer. The star radius, corrected for limb darkening, has a mean value of 12.1
mas and shows a 5.1mas amplitude pulsation. Minimum diameter was observed at
phase 0.94+/-0.01. Maximum temperature was observed several days later at phase
1.02+/-0.02. We also show that combining the angular acceleration of the
molecular layer with CO (Delta v = 3) radial velocity measurements yields a
5.9+/-1.5 mas parallax. The constant acceleration of the CO molecules -- during
80% of the pulsation cycle -- lead us to argument for a free-falling layer. The
acceleration is compatible with a gravitational field produced by a

(sub)millimeter emission associated with the supermassive black hole at the
Galactic Center. In the submillimeter regime, Sgr A* exhibits time-variable
linear polarization on timescales corresponding to <10 Schwarzschild radii of
the presumed 4 million solar mass black hole. In previous work, we demonstrated
the potential for total-intensity (sub)millimeter-wavelength VLBI to detect
time-variable -- and periodic -- source structure changes in the Sgr A* black
hole system using nonimaging analyses. Here we extend this work to include full
polarimetric VLBI observations. We simulate full-polarization (sub)millimeter
VLBI data of Sgr A* using a hot-spot model that is embedded within an accretion
disk, with emphasis on nonimaging polarimetric data products that are robust
against calibration errors. Although the source-integrated linear polarization
fraction in the models is typically only a few percent, the linear polarization
fraction on small angular scales can be much higher, enabling the detection of
changes in the polarimetric structure of Sgr A* on a wide variety of baselines.
The shortest baselines track the source-integrated linear polarization
fraction, while longer baselines are sensitive to polarization substructures
that are beam-diluted by connected-element interferometry. The detection of
periodic variability in source polarization should not be significantly
affected even if instrumental polarization terms cannot be calibrated out. As
more antennas are included in the (sub)mm-VLBI array, observations with full
polarization will provide important new diagnostics to help disentangle
intrinsic source polarization from Faraday rotation effects in the accretion
and outflow region close to the black hole event horizon.

  Implication in Astrophysics","11 pages, 2 figures",,,,"nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a fusion reactor, a proton and a neutron generated in previous reactions
may again fuse with each other. Or they can in turn fuse with or be captured by
an un-reacted deuteron. The average center-of-mass (COM) energy for such
reaction is around 10 keV in a typical fusion reactor, but could be as low as 1
keV. At this low COM energy, the reacting nucleons are in an s-wave state in
terms of their relative angular momentum. The single-gamma radiation process is
thus strongly suppressed due to conservation laws. Instead the gamma ray
released is likely to be accompanied by x-ray photons from a nuclear
bremsstrahlung process. The x-ray thus generated has a continuous spectrum and
peaks around a few hundred eV to a few keV. The average photon energy and
spectrum properties of such a process are calculated with a semiclassical
approach. The results give a peak near 1.1 keV for the proton-deuteron fusion
and a power-to-the-minus-second law in the spectrum's high-energy limit. An
analysis of some prior tokamak discharge data shows that this phenomenon might
have been observed before and it may lead to new plasma diagnostics which are
more sensitive to the ionic or nuclear degree of freedom. This phenomenon
should also play a role in nuclear astrophysics as one of the sources for
astrophysical x-rays. The process contributes particularly to stellar evolution
in the early stage, where the temperature of proto-stars or the so called
pre-main sequence stars (T Tauri stars, for example), is at a relatively low of
several million degrees Kelvin. An order-of-magnitude calculation was made on
the proton-deuteron fusion rate in young star objects. The estimated x-ray
luminosity from this reaction is found enough in magnitude to account for
experimental ones.

of massive star-forming galaxies at high redshifts, along with the galaxy
scaling relations, star formation rate density and evolution of the stellar
mass function. Building upon these encouraging agreements, we make model

and there exists a number of commonly used multicomponent and multiphase
lattice Boltzmann schemes to study such systems. In this paper we focus on a
popular implementation of a multicomponent model as introduced by Shan and
Chen. Here, interactions between different components are implemented as
repulsive forces whose strength is determined by model parameters. In this
paper we present simulations of a droplet on a hydrophobic surface. We
investigate the dependence of the contact angle on the simulation parameters
and quantitatively compare different approaches to determine it. Results show
that the method is capable of modelling the whole range of contact angles. We
find that the a priori determination of the contact angle is depending on the
simulation parameters with an uncertainty of 10 to 20%.

the Single and Double algorithms provide much smaller variances. Furthermore, a

can be used to describe the main properties of a glitch event resulting from

financial markets is a delicate issue, going back to Harrison and Kreps (1979).
In the context of optimal portfolio selection with expected utility preferences
this question has been a focus of considerable attention over the last twenty
years. We propose a novel notion of admissibility that has many pleasant
features - admissibility is characterized purely under the objective measure;
each admissible strategy can be approximated by simple strategies using finite
number of trading dates; the wealth of any admissible strategy is a
supermartingale under all pricing measures; local boundedness of the price
process is not required; neither strict monotonicity, strict concavity nor
differentiability of the utility function are necessary; the definition
encompasses both the classical mean-variance preferences and the monotone
expected utility. For utility functions finite on the whole real line, our

around nearby stars. Young stars are likely to have much stronger stellar winds
than the Sun, and because planetary magnetospheric emissions are powered by
stellar winds, stronger stellar winds may enhance the radio luminosity of any
orbiting planets. Using various stellar catalogs, we selected nearby stars (<~
30 pc) with relatively young age estimates (< 3 Gyr). We constructed different
samples from the stellar catalogs, finding between 100 and several hundred
stars. We stacked images from the 74-MHz (4-m wavelength) VLA Low-frequency Sky
Survey (VLSS), obtaining 3\sigma limits on planetary emission in the stacked
images of between 10 and 33 mJy. These flux density limits correspond to
average planetary luminosities less than 5--10 x 10^{23} erg/s. Using recent
models for the scaling of stellar wind velocity, density, and magnetic field
with stellar age, we estimate scaling factors for the strength of stellar
winds, relative to the Sun, in our samples. The typical kinetic energy carried
by the stellar winds in our samples is 15--50 times larger than that of the
Sun, and the typical magnetic energy is 5--10 times larger. If we assume that
every star is orbited by a Jupiter-like planet with a luminosity larger than
that of the Jovian decametric radiation by the above factors, our limits on
planetary luminosities from the stacking analysis are likely to be a factor of
10--100 above what would be required to detect the planets in a statistical
sense. Similar statistical analyses with observations by future instruments,
such as the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) and the Long Wavelength Array (LWA),
offer the promise of improvements by factors of 10--100.

binary (LMXB). Based on the X-ray luminosity and the Bondi accretion rate, an
IMBH accreting from the cluster gas seems unlikely and we suggest that the
X-rays are due to accretion from a companion. Alternatively, the probability
that a 1.5 solar masses cluster LMXB lies within the 95 per cent X-ray error
circle is about 0.7. Therefore we cannot rule out a single LMXB as the origin
of the X-ray emission. While we cannot distinguish between different models

motions are dominated by virialized motion (rotation plus turbulence) with
significant net inflow. The BLR mass influx is sufficient to power the AGN. The
increasing blueshifting of lines with increasing ionization potential is a
consequence of scattering off infalling material. The high blueshiftings of the
UV lines in Narrow-Line Seyfert 1s are due to enhanced BLR inflow rates rather
than strong winds. Seemingly conflicting cases of apparent outflow
reverberation mapping signatures are a result of the breakdown of the
axial-symmetry assumption in reverberation mapping. There are several plausible
causes of this breakdown: high-energy variability tends to be intrinsically
anisotropic, regions of variability are necessarily located off-axis, and X-ray

distribution of Fe line strengths in the cosmos has never been determined. This
uncertainty has contributed to the controversy surrounding the relativistic
interpretation of the emission feature. Now, by making use of the latest
multi-wavelength data, we show theoretical predictions of the cosmic density of
relativistic Fe lines as a function of their equivalent width and line flux. We
are able to show unequivocally that the most common relativistic iron lines in
the universe will be produced by neutral iron fluorescence in Seyfert galaxies
and have equivalent widths < 100 eV. Thus, the handful of very intense lines
that have been discovered are just the bright end of a distribution of line
strengths. In addition to validating the current observations, the predicted
distributions can be used for planning future surveys of relativistic Fe lines.
Finally, the predicted sky density of equivalent widths indicate that the X-ray

observations of 4U 2129+47, carried out between November 2007 and January 2008.
We found that absent the two 2005 XMM-Newton observations, all other
observations are consistent with a linear ephemeris with a constant period of
18857.63s; however, we confirm the time delay reported for the two 2005
XMM-Newton observations. Compared to a Chandra observation taken in 2000, these
new observations also confirm the disappearance of the sinusoidal modulation of
the lightcurve as reported from two 2005 XMM-Newton observations. We further
show that, compared to the Chandra observation, all of the XMM-Newton
observations have 40% lower 0.5--2 keV absorbed fluxes, and the most recent
XMM-Newton observations have a combined 2--6 keV flux that is nearly 80% lower.
Taken as a whole, the timing results support the hypothesis that the system is
in a hierarchical triple system (with a third body period of at least 175
days). The spectral results raise the question of whether the drop in soft
X-ray flux is solely attributable to the loss of the hard X-ray tail (which
might be related to the loss of sinusoidal orbital modulation), or is
indicative of further cooling of the quiescent neutron star after cessation of

responsible for large amplitude dipolar oscillations of the stalled shock
during core collapse, potentially leading to an asymmetric supernovae
explosion. The degree of asymmetry depends on the amplitude of SASI, which
nonlinear saturation mechanism has never been elucidated. We investigate the
role of parasitic instabilities as a possible cause of nonlinear SASI
saturation. As the shock oscillations create both vorticity and entropy
gradients, we show that both Kelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor types of
instabilities are able to grow on a SASI mode if its amplitude is large enough.
We obtain simple estimates of their growth rates, taking into account the
effects of advection and entropy stratification. In the context of the
advective-acoustic cycle, we use numerical simulations to demonstrate how the
acoustic feedback can be decreased if a parasitic instability distorts the
advected structure. The amplitude of the shock deformation is estimated
analytically in this scenario. When applied to the set up of Fernandez &
Thompson (2009a), this saturation mechanism is able to explain the dramatic
decrease of the SASI power when both the nuclear dissociation energy and the
cooling rate are varied. Our results open new perspectives for anticipating the
effect, on the SASI amplitude, of the physical ingredients involved in the

particular attention to the formation of BH-BH binaries, which are interesting
as sources of gravitational waves (GW). We examine the properties of these
BH-BH binaries through direct N-body simulations of star clusters using the
GPU-enabled NBODY6 code. We perform simulations of N <= 10^5 Plummer clusters
of low-mass stars with an initial population of BHs. Additionally, we do
several calculations of star clusters confined within a reflective boundary
mimicking only the core of a massive cluster. We find that stellar-mass BHs
with masses ~ 10 solar mass segregate rapidly into the cluster core and form a
sub-cluster of BHs within typically 0.2 - 0.5 pc radius, which is dense enough
to form BH-BH binaries through 3-body encounters. While most BH binaries are
ejected from the cluster by recoils received during super-elastic encounters
with the single BHs, few of them harden sufficiently so that they can merge via
GW emission within the cluster. We find that for clusters with $N \ga 5\times
10^4$, typically 1 - 2 BH-BH mergers occur within them during the first ~ 4 Gyr
of evolution. Also for each of these clusters, there are a few escaping BH
binaries that can merge within a Hubble time, most of the merger times being
within a few Gyr. These results indicate that intermediate-age massive clusters
constitute the most important class of candidates for producing dynamical BH-BH
mergers. Old globular clusters cannot contribute significantly to the
present-day BH-BH merger rate since most of the mergers from them would have
occurred earlier. In contrast, young massive clusters are too young to produce

As an application, we give a sufficient condition for equidistribution in terms
of a strong Zariski-density property on the scheme-theoretic projective space
over the residue field. As a second application, in the case of residue
characteristic zero we give an ergodic-theoretic equidistribution result for
the powers of a point in the N-dimensional unit torus. This is a
non-archimedean analogue of a well-known complex equidistribution result of
Weyl, and its proof makes essential use of a theorem of Mordell-Lang type due

the possibility of spin-incoherent Luttinger liquid physics when the
temperature is high compared to the spin energy, but small compared to the
charge energy. Using DMRG we compute the spectral properties of the $t-J$ model
at arbitrary temperatures with respect to both spin and charge energies. We
study the full crossover from the Luttinger liquid regime to the
spin-incoherent regime,focusing on small $J/t$, where the signatures of
spin-incoherent behavior are more manifest. Our method allows us to access the
analytically intractable regime where temperature is of the order of the spin
energy, $T\sim J$. Our results should be helpful in the interpretation of
experiments that may be in the crossover regime, $T\sim J$, and apply to
one-dimensional cold atomic gases where finite-temperature effects are
appreciable. The technique may also be used to guide the development of
analytical approximations for the crossover regime.

and coalgebraic logic. However, the standard coalgebraic framework does not
accommodate contravariance, and is too rigid to allow physical symmetries to be

contravariance is represented by indexing. We use this structure to give a
universal semantics for quantum systems based on a final coalgebra
construction. We characterize equality in this semantics as projective
equivalence. We also define an analogous indexed structure for Chu spaces, and
use this to obtain a novel categorical description of the category of Chu
spaces. We use the indexed structures of Chu spaces and coalgebras over a
common base to define a truncation functor from coalgebras to Chu spaces. This
truncation functor is used to lift the full and faithful representation of the
groupoid of physical symmetries on Hilbert spaces into Chu spaces, obtained in

solver with the Isotropic Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) particle method

achieve bidirectional dynamic coupling between the particle (microscale) and
continuum (macroscale) regions, the continuum solver provides state-based
boundary conditions to the particle subdomain, while the particle solver
provides flux-based boundary conditions for the continuum subdomain. The
equilibrium diffusive (Brownian) motion of a large spherical bead suspended in
a particle fluid is examined, demonstrating that the hybrid method correctly
reproduces the velocity autocorrelation function of the bead but only if
thermal fluctuations are included in the continuum solver. Finally, the hybrid
is applied to the well-known adiabatic piston problem and it is found that the
hybrid correctly reproduces the slow non-equilibrium relaxation of the piston
toward thermodynamic equilibrium but, again, only the continuum solver includes
stochastic (white-noise) flux terms. These examples clearly demonstrate the
need to include fluctuations in continuum solvers employed in hybrid multiscale
methods.

network with $n$ transmitter/receiver pairs. All channels are assumed to be
block Rayleigh fading with shadowing, described by parameters
$(\alpha,\varpi)$, where $\alpha$ denotes the probability of shadowing and
$\varpi$ represents the average cross-link gains. The analysis relies on the
distributed on-off power allocation strategy (i.e., links with a direct channel
gain above a certain threshold transmit at full power and the rest remain
silent) for the deterministic and stochastic packet arrival processes. It is
also assumed that each transmitter has a buffer size of one packet and dropping
occurs once a packet arrives in the buffer while the previous packet has not
been served. In the first part of the paper, we define a new notion of
performance in the network, called effective throughput, which captures the
effect of arrival process in the network throughput, and maximize it for
different cases of packet arrival process. It is proved that the effective
throughput of the network asymptotically scales as $\frac{\log
n}{\hat{\alpha}}$, with $\hat{\alpha} \triangleq \alpha \varpi$, regardless of
the packet arrival process. In the second part of the paper, we present the
delay characteristics of the underlying network in terms of the packet dropping
probability. We derive the sufficient conditions in the asymptotic case of $n

achieving the maximum effective throughput of the network. Finally, we study
the trade-off between the effective throughput, delay, and packet dropping
probability of the network for different packet arrival processes.

the binary system. Twenty light-curve timings calculated from Wilson-Devinney
code were used for a period study, together with all other minimum epochs. The
complex period changes of BX Peg can be sorted into a secular period decrease
caused dominantly by angular momentum loss due to magnetic stellar wind
braking, a light-travel-time (LTT) effect due to the orbit of a low-mass third
companion, and a previously unknown short-term oscillation. This last period
modulation could be produced either by a second LTT orbit with a period of
about 16 yr due to the existence of a fourth body or by the effect of magnetic
activity with a cycle length of about 12 yr.

momentum region, the form factor exhibits a $1/Q^4$ behavior, in accordance
with the perturbative QCD analysis, and also with the Light-Cone Sum Rule
(LCSR) result if the pion wave function exhibits the same endpoint behavior as
the asymptotic one. The appearance of this power behavior from the AdS side and
the LCSR approach seem to be rather similar: both of them come from the
{""}soft"" contributions. Comparing the expressions for the form factor in both
sides, one can obtain the duality relation $z\propto \sqrt{u(1-u)}$, which is
compatible with one of the most important relations of the Light-Front
holography advocated by Brodsky and de Teramond. In the moderate $Q^2$ region,
the comparison of the numerical results from both approaches also supports a
asymptotic-like pion wave function, in accordance with previous studies for the

transfer gives the $\gamma^{*}\rho^0\pi^0$ coupling constant, from which one
can determine the partial width for the $\rho^0(\omega)\to \pi^0 \gamma$ decay.
We also calculate the form factor in the time-like region, and study the
corresponding Dalitz decays $\rho^0(\omega)\to \pi^0 e^+e^-, \pi^0\mu^+\mu^-$.
Although all these results are obtained in the chiral limit, numerical

The effect of line-of-sight geometry of the coverage of the background radio
flux and any possible correlation between the 21-cm line strength and the rest
frame equivalent width of the MgII line. Regarding the former, while the
observed detection rate at small angular diameter distance ratios is a near
certainty, for an unbiased sample, where either a detection or a non-detection
are equally likely, at ratios > 0.8 the observed detection rate has an 8 sigma
significance, suggesting that the mix of ratios values at z < 1 is correlated
with the mix of detections and non-detections at low redshift, while the
exclusively high values of the ratio at z > 1 contribute to the low detection
rates at high redshift. In DLAs, the correlation between the 21-cm line
strength and the MgII equivalent width is dominated by the velocity spread of
the 21-cm line. This has recently been shown not to hold for MgII systems in
general. However, we do find the significance of the correlation to increase
when the MgII absorbers with MgI equivalent widths of >0.5 A are added to the
DLA sample. Large values of the angular diameter distance ratio may explain why
the absorbers which have similar equivalent widths to the detections remain
undetected. We do, however, also find the neutral hydrogen column densities of
the non-detections to be significantly lower. Applying the 21-cm line
strength/equivalent width correlation to yield column densities for the MgII
absorbers in which this is unmeasured, we find no evidence of a cosmological
evolution in the neutral hydrogen column density.

Gemini/GMOS spectroscopy with high signal-to-noise and intermediate-resolution
has been acquired to measure the internal kinematics and stellar populations of
the galaxies. From HST/ACS imaging, surface brightness profiles, morphologies
and structural parameters were derived for the galaxy sample. The least massive
galaxies (M=2x10^{10}M_{\sun}) in our sample have experienced their most recent
major star formation burst at z_{form}~1.1. For massive galaxies
(M>2x10^{11}M_{\sun}) the bulk of their stellar populations have been formed
earlier z_{form}>~1.6. Our results confirm previous findings by Jorgensen et
al. This suggests that the less massive galaxies in the distant clusters have
much younger stellar populations than their more massive counterparts. One
explanation is that low-mass cluster galaxies have experienced more extended
star formation histories with more frequent bursts of star formation with
shorter duration compared to the formation history of high-mass cluster
galaxies.

massive clusters at two redshifts, i.e. $z_{\rm l} \sim 0.2$ and 0.3. The
virial mass ($M_{\rm vir}$) of the simulated lens clusters at $z\sim0.2$ ranges
from $6.8\times10^{14} h^{-1} {M_{\odot}}$ to $1.1\times 10^{15} h^{-1}
M_{\odot}$. The information of background galaxies brighter than 25 magnitude
in the $I$-band is taken from Cosmological Evolution Survey (COSMOS) imaging
data. Around $1.7\times 10^5$ strong lensing realizations with these images as
background galaxies have been performed for each set. We find that the
efficiency for forming giant arcs for $z_{\rm l}=0.2$ clusters is broadly
consistent with observations. The efficiency of producing giant arcs by rich
clusters is weakly dependent on the source size and clustering. Our principal
finding is that a small proportion ($\sim 1/3$) of galaxies with elongated
shapes (e.g. ellipticity $\epsilon=1-b/a>0.5$) can boost the number of giant
arcs substantially. Compared with recent studies where a uniform ellipticity
distribution from 0 to 0.5 is used for the sources, the adoption of directly
observed shape distribution increases the number of giant arcs by a factor of
$\sim2$. Our results indicate that it is necessary to account for source
information and survey parameters (such as point-spread-function, seeing) to
make correct predictions of giant arcs and further to constrain the
cosmological parameters.(abridged)

calculation, the lowest excitation configuration with $K^\pi=16^+$ is found to
be $\nu(7/2^-[514])^{-1}(9/2^+[624])^{1}$
$\pi(7/2^+[404])^{-1}(9/2^-[514])^{1}$. Its excitation energy calculated by the
RMF theory with time-odd fields taken into account is equal to 2.801 MeV, i.e.,
close to the $^{178}$Hf$^{m2}$ experimental excitation energy 2.446 MeV. The
self-consistent procedure accounting for the time-odd component of the meson
fields is the most important aspect of the present calculation.

large scale networks, nodes must be localized. However, localization and
virtual localization techniques in sensor networks are dependent either on
expensive and sometimes unavailable hardware (e.g. GPS) or on sophisticated
localization calculus (e.g. triangulation) which are both error-prone and with
a costly overhead.
  Instead of localizing nodes in a traditional 2-dimensional space, we use
directly the raw distance to a set of anchors to route messages in a
multi-dimensional space. This should enable us to use any geographic routing

We test this technique for two different geographic routing algorithms, namely

The majority of stars that leave the main sequence are undergoing
extensive mass loss, in particular during the asymptotic giant branch (AGB)
phase of evolution. Observations show that the rate at which this phenomenon
develops differs highly from source to source, so that the time-integrated mass
loss as a function of the initial conditions (mass, metallicity, etc.) and of
the stage of evolution is presently not well understood. Aims. We are
investigating the mass loss history of AGB stars by observing the molecular and
atomic emissions of their circumstellar envelopes. Methods. In this work we
have selected two stars that are on the thermally pulsing phase of the AGB
(TP-AGB) and for which high quality data in the CO rotation lines and in the
atomic hydrogen line at 21 cm could be obained. Results. V1942 Sgr, a carbon
star of the Irregular variability type, shows a complex CO line profile that
may originate from a long-lived wind at a rate of ~ 10^-7 Msol/yr, and from a
young (< 10^4 years) fast outflow at a rate of ~ 5 10^-7 Msol/yr. Intense HI
emission indicates a detached shell with 0.044 Msol of hydrogen. This shell
probably results from the slowing-down, by surrounding matter, of the same
long-lived wind observed in CO that has been active during ~ 6 10^5 years. On
the other hand, the carbon Mira V CrB is presently undergoing mass loss at a
rate of 2 10^-7 Msol/yr, but was not detected in HI. The wind is mostly
molecular, and was active for at most 3 10^4 years, with an integrated mass
loss of at most 6.5 10^-3 Msol. Conclusions. Although both sources are carbon
stars on the TP-AGB, they appear to develop mass loss under very different
conditions, and a high rate of mass loss may not imply a high integrated mass
loss.

the surface layers of the stars. We study the role of the surface metal
abundance on the efficiency of the stochastic driving in the case of the CoRoT
target HD 49933. We compute two 3D hydrodynamical simulations representative --
in effective temperature and gravity -- of the surface layers of the CoRoT
target HD 49933, a star that is rather metal poor and significantly hotter
compared to the Sun. One 3D simulation has a solar metal abundance and the
other has a surface iron-to-hydrogen, [Fe/H], abundance ten times smaller. For
each 3D simulation we match an associated global 1D model and we compute the
associated acoustic modes using a theoretical model of stochastic excitation
validated in the case of the Sun and Alpha Cen A. The rate at which energy is
supplied per unit time into the acoustic modes associated with the 3D
simulation with [Fe/H]=-1 are found about three times smaller than those
associated with the 3D simulation with [Fe/H]=0. As shown here, these
differences are related to the fact that low metallicity implies surface layers
with a higher mean density. In turn, a higher mean density favors smaller
convective velocities and hence less efficient driving of the acoustic modes.
Our result shows the importance of taking the surface metal abundance into
account in the modeling of the mode driving by turbulent convection. A
comparison with observational data is presented in a companion paper using
seismic data obtained for the CoRoT target HD 49933.

are much higher during the monsoon than pre-monsoon season. Surprisingly,
however, the concentration of small ions are less and those of large and
intermediate ions are more during the monsoon than pre-monsoon season. The
diurnal variations observed during the pre-monsoon season show that the
nighttime small ion concentrations are about an order of magnitude higher than
their daytime values. On the contrary, the daytime concentrations of the
intermediate and large ions are much higher than those of their nighttime
values. No such diurnal variations in ion concentrations are observed in
monsoon season. Also examined are the variations in ion concentrations of
different categories with distance from the coastline in different seasons and
the ion-concentration changes associated with the precipitation of various
types that occurred over ORV Sagarkanya. It is sufficient to invoke the
ion-aerosol attachment process to explain our pre-monsoon observations.
However, the generation of highly charged large ions by the bubble-breaking

method, which is based on the geometric representations of linear

vector of fuzzy triangular numbers forms a rectangular prism in n-dimensional
space and that the image of a parallelepiped is also a parallelepiped under a
linear transformation. The suggested method clarifies why in general case
different approaches do not generate solutions as fuzzy numbers. It is
geometrically proved that if the coefficient matrix is a generalized
permutation matrix, then the solution of a fuzzy linear system (FLS) is a
vector of fuzzy numbers irrespective of the vector on the right-hand side. The
most important difference between this and previous papers on FLS is that the
solution is sought as a fuzzy set of vectors (with real components) rather than
a vector of fuzzy numbers. Each vector in the solution set solves the given FLS
with a certain possibility. The suggested method can also be applied in the
case when the right-hand side is a vector of fuzzy numbers in parametric form.
However, in this case, -cuts of the solution can not be determined by geometric
similarity and additional computations are needed.

weak interaction bosons, the Higgs sector of the standard model of elementary
particle physics has long remained one of its most obscure features. Here, it
is demonstrated through a very basic argument that standard accounts of the
Higgs mechanism suffer from a serious conceptual consistency problem, in that
they incorrectly identify physical degrees of freedom. The point at issue, is
that the reasoning which leads to a removal of the unphysical excitation modes
is valid in both phases of the theory - i.e. both after and before the phase
transition occurs. Consistently removing unphysical degrees of freedom implies
a discrepancy in the number of physical degrees of freedom. In particular, the
longitudinally polarized, massive gauge boson degrees of freedom do not have
physical counterparts before the phase transition and are thus effectively
""created ex nihilio"" at the transition, within the context of ordinary Higgs
models. Possible scenarios for removing the discrepancy are briefly considered.
The results obtained here strongly indicate that although standard,
perturbative formulations of the Higgs mechanism provide a convenient
parametrization of electroweak physics over a certain range of scales, they
cannot provide a sensible explanation of all relevant physical degrees of
freedom involved.

supermultiplets. We find non-vanishing VEVs for the auxiliary components of the

order m_{SUSY} x <phi> and m_{SUSY}, respectively. Thereby, m_{SUSY} is the
generic soft SUSY breaking scale which is expected to be around 1 TeV and <phi>

quite common and ""large amplitude oscillations"" ($>$20 km s$^{-1}$) for which
observations are scarce. Large amplitude oscillations have been found as
""winking filament"" in H$\alpha$ as well as motion in the sky plane in
H$\alpha$, EUV, micro-wave and He 10830 observations. Historically, it was
suggested that the large amplitude oscillations in prominences were triggered
by disturbances such as fast-mode MHD waves (Moreton wave) produced by remote
flares. Recent observations show, in addition, that near-by flares or jets can
also create such large amplitude oscillations in prominences. Large amplitude
oscillations, which are observed both in transverse as well as longitudinal
direction, have a range of periods varying from tens of minutes to a couple of
hours. Using the observed period of oscillation and simple theoretical models,
the obtained magnetic field in prominences has shown quite a good agreement
with directly measured one and therefore, justifies prominences seismology as a
powerful diagnostic tool. On rare occasions, when the large amplitude
oscillations have been observed before or during the eruption, the oscillations
may be applied to diagnose the stability and the eruption mechanism. Here we
review the recent developments and understanding in the observational
properties of large amplitude oscillations and their trigger mechanisms and
stability in the context of prominence seismology.

constructs such a tree. Moreover, if the input triplet set is dense and, in
addition, is fully consistent with some level-1 network, it will find such a
network. The potential of LEV1ATHAN is explored by means of an extensive
simulation study and a biological data set. One of our conclusions is that
LEV1ATHAN is able to construct networks consistent with a high percentage of
input triplets, even when these input triplets are affected by a low to
moderate level of noise.

scalar gauge singlet is introduced and discussed. The model allows to
ameliorate the little hierarchy problem by lifting the minimal scalar Higgs

lifted to \gsim 15 TeV depending on the mass of the lightest scalar.

determine which core properties can be robustly identified and which depend on
the extraction technique. Four regions in the cloud are examined: NGC1333,
IC348/HH211, L1448 and L1455. We identify clumps of dust emission using two
popular automated algorithms, CLFIND and GAUSSCLUMPS, finding 85 and 122 clumps
in total respectively. Some trends are true for both populations: clumps become
increasingly elongated over time and are consistent with constant surface
brightness objects, with an average brightness ~4 to 10 times larger than the
surrounding molecular cloud; the clump mass distribution (CMD) resembles the
stellar intial mass function, with a slope alpha = -2.0+/-0.1 for CLFIND and
alpha = -3.15+/-0.08 for GAUSSCLUMPS, which straddle the Salpeter value. The
mass at which the slope shallows (similar for both algorithms at M~6 Msun)
implies a star-forming efficiency of between 10 and 20 per cent. Other trends
reported elsewhere depend on the clump-finding technique: we find protostellar
clumps are both smaller (for GAUSSCLUMPS) and larger (for CLFIND) than their
starless counterparts; the functional form, best-fitting to the CMD, is
different for the two algorithms. The GAUSSCLUMPS CMD is best-fitted with a
log-normal distribution, whereas a broken power law is best for CLFIND; the
reported lack of massive starless cores in previous studies can be seen in the
CLFIND but not the GAUSSCLUMPS data. Our approach highlights similarities and
differences between the clump populations, illustrating the caution that must
be exercised when comparing results from different studies and interpreting the

parametric sensitivity is the derivative of the solution to the equation with

parameter. It is proved that the particle system converges weakly to the
sensitivity as the number of particles N increases. A Monte Carlo algorithm is
developed and variance reduction techniques are applied. Numerical experiments
are conducted for two kernels: the additive kernel and one which has been used
for studying soot formation in a free molecular regime. It is shown empirically
that the techniques for variance reduction are indeed very effective and that
the order of convergence is O(1/N). The algorithm is then compared to an
algorithm based on a finite difference approximation to the sensitivity and it
is found that the variance of the sensitivity estimators are considerably lower

number of interactions as measured for instance by their essentiality. Our
model thus provides a simple mechanism for the emergence of sparse regulatory

support since very high--degree modes (up to ell=14) are identified. We also
prove that cancellation effects are not sufficient in removing the flux
variations associated to these modes at the noise level of the CoRoT

lensed by dark matter haloes of galaxies in the foreground. Since SNe Ia have
very small dispersion after light curve shape and colour corrections, their
brightness can be used to measure properties of the dark matter haloes via
gravitational magnification. We use observations of galaxies and SNe Ia within
the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) to measure the relation
between galaxy luminosity and dark matter halo mass. The relation we
investigate is a scaling law between velocity dispersion and galaxy luminosity
in the B-band. The best-fitting values to this relation (velocity dispersion
normalisation and exponent) are 136 km/s and 0.27. We find the velocity
dispersion normalisation to be less than 190 km/s at the 95 per cent confidence
level. This method provides an independent cross-check of measurements of dark
matter halo properties from galaxy-galaxy lensing studies. Our results agree
with the galaxy-galaxy lensing results, but have much larger uncertainties. The
GOODS sample of SNe Ia is relatively small (we include 24 SNe) and the results
therefore depend on individual SNe Ia. We have investigated a number of
potential systematic effects. Light curve fitting, which affects the inferred
brightness of the SNe Ia, appears to be the most important one. Results
obtained using different light curve fitting procedures differ at the 68.3 per

hard component (BMC1, photon index Gamma_1=1.7-3.0) with turnover at high
energies and soft thermal component (BMC2, Gamma_2=2.7-4.2) with characteristic
color temperature <1 keV, and the redskewed iron line (LAOR) component. We also
present observable correlations between the index and the normalization of the
disk ""seed"" component. The use of ""seed"" disk normalization, which is
presumably proportional to mass accretion rate in the disk, is crucial to
establish the index saturation effect during the transition to the soft state.
We discovered the photon index saturation of the soft and hard spectral
components at values of 4.2 and 3 respectively. We present a physical model
which explains the index-seed photon normalization correlations. We argue that
the index saturation effect of the hard component (BMC1) is due to the soft
photon Comptonization in the converging inflow close to BH and that of soft
component is due to matter accumulation in the transition layer when mass
accretion rate increases. In addition to our spectral model components we also
find a strong feature of ""blackbody-like"" bump which color temperature is about
4.5 keV in eight observations of the intermediate and soft states. We discuss a
possible origin of this ""blackbody-like"" emission.

toward the lowest levels of both radio and optical luminosities. Radio images,
available for all 63 galaxies with BT < 14.4, show the presence of a compact
radio source in 12 objects, with fluxes spanning from 0.13 to 2700 mJy. The
remaining 51 galaxies, undetected at a flux limit of ~0.1 mJy, have radio
luminosities L < 4 10E18 W/Hz . The fraction of radio-detected galaxies are a
strong function of stellar mass, in agreement with previous results: none of
the 30 galaxies with stellar mass M(star) < 1.7 10E10 M(sun) is detected, while
8 of the 11 most massive galaxies have radio cores. There appears to be no
simple relation between the presence of a stellar nucleus and radio emission. A
multiwavelength analysis of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) emission,
combining radio and X-ray data, confirms the link between optical surface
brightness profile and radio loudness in the sense that the bright core
galaxies are associated with radio-loud AGNs, while non-core galaxies host
radio-quiet AGNs. Not all radio-detected galaxies have a X-ray nuclear counter
part (and vice-versa). A complete census of AGNs (and supermassive black holes,
SMBHs) thus requires observations, at least, in both bands. Nonetheless, there
are massive galaxies in the sample, expected to host a large SMBH (M(BH) ~ 10E8
M(sun)), whose nuclear emission eludes detection despite their proximity and
the depth and the spatial resolution of the available observations. Most likely
this is due to an extremely low level of accretion onto the central SMBH.

the interactions of pions at low energies, in these lectures we review the
quantization procedure of Einstein gravity in the spirit of effective field
theories. As has been emphasized by several authors, quantum corrections to
observables in gravity are, by naive power counting, very small. While some
quantities are not predictable (they require local counterterms of higher
dimensionality) others, non local, are. A notable example is the calculation of
quantum corrections to Newton's law. Albeit tiny these corrections are of
considerable theoretical importance, perhaps providing information on the
ultaviolet properties of gravity. We then try to search for a situation where
these non local corrections may be observable in a cosmological context in the
early universe. Having seen that gravity admits an effective treatment similar
to the one of pions, we pursue this analogy and propose a two-dimensional toy
model where a dynamical zwei-bein is generated from a theory without any metric
at all.

$\Bbbk$ with the standard $\mathbb{Z}^m$ grading and $L$ a multigraded
Noetherian $R$-module. When $\Bbbk$ is a field, Tchernev has an explicit
construction of a multigraded free resolution called the T-resolution of $L$
over $R$. Despite the explicit canonical description, this method uses linear
algebraic methods, which makes the structure hard to understand. This paper
gives a combinatorial description for the free modules, making the T-resolution
clearer. In doing so, we must introduce an ordering on the elements. This
ordering identifies a canonical generating set for the free modules. This
combinatorial construction additionally allows us to define the free modules
over $\mathbb{Z}$ instead of a field. Moreover, this construction gives a
combinatorial description for one component of the differential. An example is
computed in the first section to illustrate this new approach.

found by the Galaxy Zoo project. By carefully selecting face-on, disk dominated
spirals we construct a sample of truly passive disks (not dust reddened, nor
dominated by old stellar populations in a bulge). As such, our red spirals
represent an interesting set of possible transition objects between normal blue
spirals and red early types. We use SDSS data to investigate the physical
processes which could have turned these objects red without disturbing their
morphology. Red spirals prefer intermediate density regimes, however there are
no obvious correlations between red spiral properties and environment -
environment alone is not sufficient to determine if a spiral will become red.
Red spirals are a small fraction of spirals at low masses, but are a
significant fraction at large stellar masses - massive galaxies are red
independent of morphology. We confirm that red spirals have older stellar popns
and less recent star formation than the main spiral population. While the
presence of spiral arms suggests that major star formation cannot have ceased
long ago, we show that these are not recent post-starbursts, so star formation
must have ceased gradually. Intriguingly, red spirals are ~4 times more likely
than normal spirals to host optically identified Seyfert or LINER, with most of
the difference coming from LINERs. We find a curiously large bar fraction in
the red spirals suggesting that the cessation of star formation and bar
instabilities are strongly correlated. We conclude by discussing the possible
origins. We suggest they may represent the very oldest spiral galaxies which
have already used up their reserves of gas - probably aided by strangulation,
and perhaps bar instabilities moving material around in the disk.

quantities: the four point function of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
and the amplitude of flux decrements in quasar (QSO) spectra. The amplitude of
CMB convergence in a given direction measures the projected surface density of
matter. Measurements of QSO flux decrements trace the small-scale distribution
of gas along a given line-of-sight. While the cross-correlation between these
two measurements is small for a single line-of-sight, upcoming large surveys
should enable its detection. This paper presents analytical estimates for the
signal to noise (S/N) for measurements of the cross-correlation between the
flux decrement and the convergence and for measurements of the
cross-correlation between the variance in flux decrement and the convergence.
For the ongoing BOSS (SDSS III) and Planck surveys, we estimate an S/N of 30
and 9.6 for these two correlations. For the proposed BigBOSS and ACTPOL
surveys, we estimate an S/N of 130 and 50 respectively. Since the
cross-correlation between the variance in flux decrement and the convergence is
proportional to the fourth power of $\sigma_8$, the amplitude of these
cross-correlations can potentially be used to measure the amplitude of
$\sigma_8$ at z~2 to 2.5% with BOSS and Planck and even better with future data
sets. These measurements have the potential to test alternative theories for
dark energy and to constrain the mass of the neutrino. The large potential
signal estimated in our analytical calculations motivate tests with non-linear
hydrodynamical simulations and analyses of upcoming data sets.
