acceleration may be a transient phenomenon. We investigate a toy model that
reproduces such a background behavior as the result of a time-dependent

constrain the parameter space using the $\tau$ LFV decays together with the

(SNe Ia) by the Carnegie Supernova Project. Well-sampled, high-precision
optical (ugriBV) and near-infrared (NIR; YJHKs) light curves obtained in a
well-understood photometric system are used to provide light-curve parameters,
and ugriBVYJH template light curves. The intrinsic colors at maximum light are
calibrated to compute optical--NIR color excesses for the full sample, thus
allowing the properties of the reddening law in the host galaxies to be
studied. A low value of Rv~1.7, is derived when using the entire sample of SNe.
However, when the two highly reddened SNe in the sample are excluded, a value
Galactic standard of Rv~3.2 is obtained. The colors of these two events are
well matched by a reddening model due to circumstellar dust. The peak
luminosities are calibrated using a two-parameter linear fit to the decline
rates and the colors, or alternatively, the color excesses. In both cases,
dispersions in absolute magnitude of 0.12--0.16 mag are obtained, depending on
the filter-color combination. In contrast to the results obtained from color
excesses, these fits give Rv~1--2, even when the two highly reddened SNe are
excluded. This discrepancy suggests that, beyond the ""normal"" interstellar
reddening produced in the host galaxies, there is an intrinsic dispersion in
the colors of SNe Ia which is correlated with luminosity but independent of the
decline rate. Finally, a Hubble diagram is produced by combining the results of
the fits for each filter. The resulting scatter of 0.12 mag appears to be
limited by peculiar velocities as evidenced by the strong correlation between
the distance-modulus residuals among the different filters. The implication is
that the actual precision of SN Ia distances is 3--4%.

conservation of gravitational energy-momentum dates to the 1910s. A suitably
covariant infinite-component localization is displayed, reflecting Bergmann's
realization that there are infinitely many conserved gravitational
energy-momenta. Initially use is made of a flat background metric or connection
(or rather, all of them), because the desired gauge invariance properties are
obvious. Partial gauge-fixing then yields an appropriate covariant quantity
without any background metric or connection; one version is the collection of
pseudotensors of a given type, such as the Einstein pseudotensor, in_every_
coordinate system. This solution to the gauge covariance problem is easily
adapted to any pseudotensorial expression or to any tensorial expression built
with a background metric or connection. Thus the specific functional form can
be chosen on technical grounds such as relating to Noether's theorem and
yielding expected values of conserved quantities in certain contexts and then
rendered covariant using the procedure described here. The application to
angular momentum localization is straightforward. Traditional objections to
pseudotensors are based largely on the false assumption that there is only one
gravitational energy rather than infinitely many.

all the intermediate levels of a modern system for computer-aided diagnosis

defining the imaging characteristics and features that are relevant to probable

new, integrated radio-logical systems that exhibit embedded digital signal
processing, in order to improve the final result and minimize the radiological
dose for the patient. In a higher level, special algorithms are designed for
detecting and encoding these clinically interest-ing imaging features, in order
to be used as input to advanced pattern classifiers and machine learning
models. Finally, these approaches are extended in multi-classifier models under
the scope of Game Theory and optimum collective deci-sion, in order to produce
efficient solutions for combining classifiers with minimum computational costs
for advanced diagnostic systems. The material covered in this thesis is related

Dirichlet boundary condition which is generally allowed in higher dimensional
theories. The lightest physical Higgs has non-flat profile in the extra
dimension even though the vacuum expectation value is flat. As a consequence,
we predict a maximal top Yukawa deviation (no coupling between top and Higgs)
for the Brane-Localized Fermion and a small deviation, a multiplication of
2\sqrt{2}/\pi\simeq0.9 to the Yukawa coupling, for the Bulk Fermion. The latter
is consistent with the electroweak precision data within 90% CL for
430GeV\lesssim m_{KK}\lesssim 500GeV.

active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the local universe, with which correlations of

between the arrival direction of super-GZK protons and the sky position of
their actual sources is quite large with the mean value of $<\theta > \sim
15^{\circ}$ and the median value of $\tilde \theta \sim 7 - 10^{\circ}$. On the
other hand, the separation angle between the arrival direction and the sky
position of nearest reference objects is substantially smaller with $<S > \sim

nearest neighbors among the reference objects. This is a direct consequence of
our model that the sources, observers, reference objects, and the IGMF all
trace the matter distribution of the universe. The result implies that
extragalactic objects lying closest to the arrival direction of UHECRs are not

form a dimer, is common in nature. This process can be modeled using rate
equations, from which the average copy numbers of the reacting monomers and of
the product dimers can then be obtained. However, the rate equations apply only
when these copy numbers are large. In the limit of small copy numbers the
system becomes dominated by fluctuations, which are not accounted for by the
rate equations. In this limit one must use stochastic methods such as direct
integration of the master equation or Monte Carlo simulations. These methods
are computationally intensive and rarely succumb to analytical solutions. Here
we use the recently introduced moment equations which provide a highly
simplified stochastic treatment of the dimerization process. Using this
approach, we obtain an analytical solution for the copy numbers and reaction
rates both under steady state conditions and in the time-dependent case. We
analyze three different dimerization processes: dimerization without
dissociation, dimerization with dissociation and hetero-dimer formation. To
validate the results we compare them with the results obtained from the master
equation in the stochastic limit and with those obtained from the rate
equations in the deterministic limit. Potential applications of the results in
different physical contexts are discussed.

nodes represent the objects and the edges represent the interactions between
them. The applications include chemical and metabolic systems, food webs as
well as social networks. Lately, it was found that many of these networks
display some common topological features, such as high clustering, small
average path length (small world networks) and a power-law degree distribution
(scale free networks). The topological features of a network are commonly
related to the network's functionality. However, the topology alone does not
account for the nature of the interactions in the network and their strength.
Here we introduce a method for evaluating the correlations between pairs of
nodes in the network. These correlations depend both on the topology and on the
functionality of the network. A network with high connectivity displays strong
correlations between its interacting nodes and thus features small-world
functionality. We quantify the correlations between all pairs of nodes in the
network, and express them as matrix elements in the correlation matrix. From
this information one can plot the correlation function for the network and to
extract the correlation length. The connectivity of a network is then defined
as the ratio between this correlation length and the average path length of the
network. Using this method we distinguish between a topological small world and
a functional small world, where the latter is characterized by long range
correlations and high connectivity. Clearly, networks which share the same
topology, may have different connectivities, based on the nature and strength
of their interactions. The method is demonstrated on metabolic networks, but
can be readily generalized to other types of networks.

these PDFs. Recent measurements of the strong coupling $\alpha_S$ and jet
substructure from HERA at similar energy scales are also reviewed.

Gonzalez-Martin","The G Gravitational Parameter and the Concepts of Mass and Dark Matter","14 pages",,,"SB/F/351.2-07","physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The gravitational coupling parameter G is determined by a non riemannian
curvature scalar of a background substratum. This substratum represents an
inertial solution to the nonlinear equations of a geometric unified theory and
provides a limit solution to general solutions in the theory. When a solution
approaches the substratum solution as a limit we physically obtain a newtonian
limit of the gravitational sector of the unified theory. The curvature scalar
is determined by the interaction mass-energy content of the solution. In the
limit the equation reduces to Poisson equation and the curvature scalar reduces
to the constant substratum curvature scalar which determines Newton
gravitational constant G. Outside the limit the curvature parameter replaces
the newtonian constant G as the coupling parameter of Einstein equation of
gravitation. This new parameter may be approximately constant in certain
physical conditions but, in general should be considered a variable which
depends on the matter and energy on space-time. This effect and the geometric
structure of matter and fields may be interpreted as dark matter effects. The
substratum also determines a constant mass parameter for field excitations
which obey the Dirac equation and behave as particles. Physically we consider
that the substratum provides two related mass scales: the gravitational
constant G characterizes a macroscopic mass scale and a fundamental particle
mass m characterizes a microscopic mass scale. The substratum geometrically
represents the physical concept of inertial system.

of particle physics. However, there are some remaining puzzles that are not
explained within the context of its present framework. We discuss the
possibility to discover new physics in the ATLAS Detector via a four-fermion
contact interaction, much in the same way Fermi first described Weak
interactions. Using a simple ratio method on dimuon events, we can set a 95%
C.L. lower limit on the effective scale Lambda = 7.5 TeV (8.7 TeV) for the
constructive Left-left Isoscalar Model of quark compositeness with 100 pb^-1

that the unknown function $f(t)$ is continuous with (known) compact support. An
adaptive iterative method and an adaptive stopping rule, which yield the
convergence of the approximate solution to $f(t)$, are proposed in this paper.
