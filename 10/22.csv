at large m_0. We show that there are many high-likelihood points in the CMSSM

finite but scheme-dependent gluon masses. In this work we show how such
divergences can be eliminated completely by virtue of a characteristic
identity, valid in dimensional regularization. The ability to trigger the
aforementioned identity hinges crucially on the particular Ansatz employed for
the three-gluon vertex entering into the Schwinger-Dyson equation governing the
gluon propagator. The use of the appropriate three-gluon vertex brings about an
additional advantage: one obtains two separate (but coupled) integral
equations, one for the effective charge and one for the gluon mass. This system
of integral equations has a unique solution, which unambiguously determines
these two quantities. Most notably, the effective charge freezes in the
infrared, and the gluon mass displays power-law running in the ultraviolet, in
agreement with earlier considerations.

use structured pulses, in which, in addition to satisfying conditions for
adiabatic evolution, there occurs a sign change of the Rabi frequency when the

analysis and recognition. Since direct adjacency has only six types of digital
surface points in local configurations, it is easy to determine and classify
the discrete curvatures for every point on the boundary of a 3D object. Unlike
the boundary simplicial decomposition (triangulation), the curvature can take
any real value. It sometimes makes difficulties to find a right value for
threshold. This paper focuses on the global properties of categorizing
curvatures for small regions. We use both digital Gaussian curvatures and
digital mean curvatures to 3D shapes. This paper proposes a multi-scale method
for 3D object analysis and a vector method for 3D similarity classification. We
use these methods for face recognition and shape classification. We have found
that the Gaussian curvatures mainly describe the global features and average
characteristics such as the five regions of a human face. However, mean
curvatures can be used to find local features and extreme points such as nose
in 3D facial data.

square lattice and random regular graphs defining four neighbors for each one.
The players follow one of the three strategies: tit-for-tat, unconditional
cooperation, and defection. The simplified payoff matrix is characterized by
two parameters: the temptation $b$ to choose defection, and the cost $c$ of
inspection reducing the income of tit-for-tat. The strategy imitation from one
of the neighbors is controlled by pairwise comparison at a fixed level of
noise. Using Monte Carlo simulations and the extended versions of pair
approximation we have evaluated the $b-c$ phase diagrams indicating a rich
plethora of phase transitions between stationary coexistence, absorbing and
oscillatory states, including continuous and discontinuous phase transitions.
By reasonable costs the tit-for-tat strategy prevents extinction of cooperators
across the whole span of $b$ values determining the prisoner's dilemma game,
irrespective of the interaction graph structure. We also demonstrate that the
system can exhibit a repetitive succession of oscillatory and stationary states
upon changing a single payoff value, which highlights the remarkable
sensitivity of cyclical interactions on parameters that define the strength of
dominance.

are important in testing Lambda cold dark matter cosmology and locating
gravitational-wave-radiation sources. A unique electromagnetic signature of
SMBHBs in galactic nuclei is essential in identifying the binaries in
observations from the IR band through optical to X-ray. Recently, the flares in
optical, UV, and X-ray caused by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) tidally
disrupting nearby stars have been successfully used to observationally probe
single SMBHs in normal galaxies. In this Letter, we investigate the accretion
of the gaseous debris of a tidally disrupted star by a SMBHB. Using both
stability analysis of three-body systems and numerical scattering experiments,
we show that the accretion of stellar debris gas, which initially decays with
time $\propto t^{-5/3}$, would stop at a time $T_{\rm tr} \simeq \eta T_{\rm
b}$. Here, $\eta \sim0.25$ and $T_{\rm b}$ is the orbital period of the SMBHB.
After a period of interruption, the accretion recurs discretely at time $T_{\rm
r} \simeq \xi T_b$, where $\xi \sim 1$. Both $\eta$ and $\xi$ sensitively
depend on the orbital parameters of the tidally disrupted star at the tidal
radius and the orbit eccentricity of SMBHB. The interrupted accretion of the
stellar debris gas gives rise to an interrupted tidal flare, which could be
used to identify SMBHBs in non-active galaxies in the upcoming transient
surveys.

the pathways of energy transfer across the complex, suppressing ineffective
pathways and facilitating direct ones to the reaction centre. We explain that
the fundamental mechanisms underpinning DAT are expected to be robust with
respect to the considered noise model but show that the specific details of the
exciton-phonon coupling, which remain largely unknown in these type of

variations of dynamical features that should be amenable to experimental

to the detection of flux in the Lyman alpha forest at redshifts z<6. However,
since reionization is expected to be highly inhomogeneous, much of the spectra
pass through just the ionized component of the intergalactic medium (IGM) even
for non-negligible values of the volume-weighted mean neutral hydrogen
fraction, x_HI. We study the expected signature of an incomplete reionization
at z ~ 5--6, using very large-scale (2 Gpc) seminumeric simulations. We find
that ruling out an incomplete reionization is difficult at these redshifts
since: (1) quasars reside in biased regions of the ionization field, with fewer
surrounding HI patches than implied by the global mean, x_H; (2) absorption
from the residual neutral hydrogen inside the ionized IGM generally dominates
over the absorption from the remaining HI regions; (3) modeling the Lyman alpha
forest and its redshift evolution even in just the ionized IGM is very
difficult, and nearly impossible to do a priori. We propose using the fraction
of pixels which are dark as a simple, nearly model-independent upper limit on
x_HI. Alternately, the size distribution of regions with no detectable flux
(dark gaps) can be used to place a more model dependent constraint. Either way,
the current sample of quasars is statistically insufficient to constrain x_HI
at z~6 to even the 10 per cent level. At z~5, where there are more available
sightlines and the forest is less dark, constraining x_HI < 0.1 might be
possible given a large dynamic range from very deep spectra and/or the Lyman
beta forest. We conclude with the caution against over-interpreting the
observations. There is currently no direct evidence that reionization was
complete by z ~ 5-6.

specific non-diagonal entries of the covariance function are sensitive to the
strength of the inhomogeneity, while the diagonal entries are not. These

background geometry, are observational signatures of a large-scale
inhomogeneity in the background geometry of the universe. Furthermore, we find
that an inhomogeneity in the gravitational potential of super-Hubble size would
yield a power asymmetry in the CMB with maximal asymmetry at an angle of 90
degrees to the CMB dipole axis. The axis of the CMB power asymmetry was
recently estimated by Eriksen et. al. to be located at angles between 83 and 96
degrees to the CMB dipole axis, which is consistent with the prediction of our
model. This implies that the location of the observed power asymmetry in the
CMB sky could be accounted for by a large-scale inhomogeneity in the
gravitational field enclosing the present Hubble volume.

and the momentum distribution of one-dimensional dipolar bosons, with dipole
moments polarized perpendicular to the direction of confinement. We observe
that the long-range nature of the dipole interaction has dramatic effects on
the off-diagonal correlations: although the dipoles never crystallize, the
system goes from a quasi-condensate regime at low interactions to a regime in
which quasi-condensation is discarded, in favor of quasi-solidity. For all
strengths of the dipolar interaction, the OBDM shows an oscillatory behavior
coexisting with an overall algebraic decay; and the momentum distribution shows
sharp kinks at the wavevectors of the oscillations, $Q = \pm 2\pi n$ (where $n$
is the atom density), beyond which it is strongly suppressed. This
\emph{momentum filtering} effect introduces a characteristic scale in the
momentum distribution, which can be arbitrarily squeezed by lowering the atom
density. This shows that one-dimensional dipolar Bose gases, realized e.g. by
trapped dipolar molecules, show strong signatures of the dipolar interaction in
time-of-flight measurements.

among which one of the more surprising is the electron nematic, a
translationally invariant metallic phase with a spontaneously generated spatial
anisotropy. Classical nematics generally occur in liquids of rod-like
molecules; given that electrons are point-like, the initial theoretical
motivation for contemplating electron nematics came from thinking of the
electron fluid as a quantum melted electron crystal, rather than a strongly
interacting descendent of a Fermi gas. That such phases exist in nature was
established by dramatic transport experiments in ultra-clean quantum Hall
systems in 1999 and in Sr3Ru2O7 in a strong magnetic field in 2007.
  In this paper, we briefly review the theoretical considerations governing
nematic order, summarize the quantum Hall and Sr3Ru2O7 experiments that
unambiguously establish the existence of this phase, and survey some of the
current evidence for such a phase in the cuprate and Fe-based high temperature

the silicate dust shell is likely to contribute. By using two imaging
reconstruction algorithms, we unveiled two bright spots on the surface of
Betelgeuse. One spot has a diameter of about 11 mas and accounts for about 8.5%

\Msun and M/L = 8.7 \pm 1.0 (or 8.0 \pm 0.9 after foreground Galactic
extinction is corrected). We confirm the presence of a dark matter halo, but
the stellar mass dominates inside the effective radius. The parameters of the
dark halo are less constrained due to the sparse globular cluster data at large
radii. We find that in NGC 4649 the dynamical mass profile from our modeling is
consistently larger than that derived from the X-ray data over most of the
radial range by roughly 60% to 80%. It implies that either some forms of
non-thermal pressure need to be included, the assumed hydrostatic equilibrium
may not be a good approximation in the X-ray modelings of NGC 4649, or our
assumptions used in the dynamical models are biased. Our new black hole mass is
about two times larger than the previous published value; the earlier model did
not adequately sample the orbits required to match the large tangential
anisotropy in the galaxy center. If we assume that there is no dark matter, the
results on the black hole mass and M/L do not change significantly, which we
attribute to the inclusion of HST spectra, the sparse globular cluster
kinematics, and a diffuse dark matter halo. Without the HST data, the
significance of the black hole detection is greatly reduced.

priors nor parameterization of the photo-z probability distribution function,
and preserves all of the cosmological information available from shear-shear
measurement. We estimate the calibration accuracy through the Fisher matrix
formalism. We find that, for advanced lensing surveys such as the planned stage
IV surveys, the rate of photo-z outliers can be determined with statistical
uncertainties of 0.01-1% for $z<2$ galaxies. Among the several sources of
calibration error that we identify and investigate, the {\it galaxy
distribution bias} is likely the most dominant systematic error, whereby
photo-z outliers have different redshift distributions and/or bias than
non-outliers from the same bin. This bias affects all photo-z calibration
techniques based on correlation measurements. Galaxy bias variations of
$O(0.1)$ produce biases in photo-z outlier rates similar to the statistical
errors of our method, so this galaxy distribution bias may bias the
reconstructed scatters at several-$\sigma$ level, but is unlikely to completely
invalidate the self-calibration technique.

streaming over IP networks, which we refer to as media-TCP. Unlike existing
congestion control schemes that adapt a user's sending rate merely to the
network condition, our solution adapts the sending rate to both the network
condition and the application characteristics by explicitly considering the
distortion impacts, delay deadlines, and interdependencies of different video
packet classes. Hence, our media-aware solution is able to provide differential
services for transmitting various packet classes and thereby, further improves
the multimedia streaming quality. We model this problem using a Finite-Horizon
Markov Decision Process (FHMDP) and determine the optimal congestion control
policy that maximizes the long-term multimedia quality, while adhering to the
horizon- TCP-friendliness constraint, which ensures long-term fairness with
existing TCP applications. We show that the FHMDP problem can be decomposed
into multiple optimal stopping problems, which admit a low-complexity
threshold-based solution. Moreover, unlike existing congestion control
approaches, which focus on maintaining throughput-based fairness among users,
the proposed media-TCP aims to achieve quality-based fairness among multimedia
users. We also derive sufficient conditions for multiple multimedia users to
achieve quality-based fairness using media-TCP congestion control. Our
simulation results show that the proposed media-TCP achieves more than 3dB
improvement in terms of PSNR over the conventional TCP congestion control
approaches, with the largest improvements observed for real-time streaming
applications requiring stringent playback delays.

disequilibrium, Renyi and Tsallis entropies. An alternative and simpler

HII region NGC 6357 containing the young open star cluster Pismis 24. These

presence of a narrow (~20 km/s) and broad (50-150 km/s) component to the
H_alpha emission line, where the broadest broad component widths are found in a
region that follows the shape of the eastern pillar edge. These connections
have allowed us to firmly associate the broad component with emission from
ionized gas within turbulent mixing layers on the pillar's surface set up by
the shear flows of the O-star winds from the cluster. We discuss the
implications of our findings in terms of the broad emission line component that
is increasingly found in extragalactic starburst environments. Although the
broad line widths found here are narrower, we conclude that the mechanisms
producing both must be the same. The difference in line widths may result from
the lower total mechanical wind energy produced by the O stars in Pismis 24
compared to that from a typical young massive star cluster found in a starburst
galaxy. The pillar's edge is also clearly defined by dense (<5000 cm^-3), hot
(>20000 K), and excited (via [NII]/H_a and [SII]/H_a ratios) gas conditions,
implying the presence of a D-type ionization front propagating into the pillar
surface. Although there must be both photoevaporation outflows produced by the
ionization front, and mass-loss through mechanical ablation, we see no evidence
for any significant bulk gas motions on or around the pillar. We postulate that
the evaporated/ablated gas must be rapidly heated before being entrained.

congestion games (CG) in which multiple users share the same set of resources
and their payoff for using any resource is a function of the total number of
users sharing it. The classical congestion games enjoy some very appealing
properties, including the existence of a Nash equilibrium and that every
improvement path is finite and leads to such a NE (also called the finite
improvement property or FIP), which is also a local optimum to a potential
function. On the other hand, this class of games does not model well the
congestion or resource sharing in a wireless context, a prominent feature of
which is spatial reuse. What this translates to in the context of a congestion
game is that a users payoff for using a resource (interpreted as a channel) is
a function of the its number of its interfering users sharing that channel,
rather than the total number among all users. This makes the problem quite
different. We will call this the congestion game with resource reuse (CG-RR).
In this paper we study intrinsic properties of such a game; in particular, we
seek to address under what conditions on the underlying network this game
possesses the FIP or NE. We also discuss the implications of these results when
applied to wireless spectrum sharing

the fluctuations of the interface separating locally square and triangular
ordered regions. We demonstrate the breakdown of effective ``shaking
temperature'' treatments in the coexistence regime by showing that such shaking
temperatures are non-monotonic functions of the drive in this regime. Finally
we discuss the relevance of these simulations to the anomalous behaviour seen
in the peak effect regime of vortex lines in the disordered mixed phase of
type-II superconductors. We propose that this anomalous behavior is directly
linked to the behavior exhibited in our simulations in the dynamical
coexistence regime, thus suggesting a possible solution to the problem of the
origin of peak effect anomalies.

is obtained by DDRHF with the effective interactions PKO2 and PKO3 for the
occurrence of direct Urca process in neutron stars. The maximum masses of

observed at high resolution with good sensitivity. This allows to study the

this radio-loud source (e.g. merger history, AGN activity). At the same time,
it is important to compare the results to other sources of the same class (i.e.
early-type galaxies in general and radio galaxies in particular) to see how
Centaurus A fits into the global picture of early-type/radio galaxy evolution.
The amount of HI, the morphology of a warped disk with HI clouds surrounding

necessarily responsible for AGN activity fits with the observational result
that the recent merger event in Centaurus A is not connected to the current

linear polarization of optical radiation emitted by ultracool dwarfs, there has
been comparatively less rigorous theoretical analysis of the problem. The
general expectation has been that the atmospheres of those substellar-mass
objects with condensate clouds would give rise to linear polarization due to
scattering. Because of rotation-induced non-sphericity, there is expected to be
incomplete cancellation of disk-integrated net polarization and thus a finite
polarization. For cloudless objects, however, only molecular Rayleigh
scattering will contribute to any net polarization and this limit has not been
well studied. Hence in this paper we present a detailed multiple scattering
analysis of the polarization expected from those T-dwarfs whose spectra show
absence of condensates. For this, we develop and solve the full radiative
transfer equations for linearly polarized radiation. Only atomic and molecular
Rayleigh scattering are considered to be the source of polarization. We compute
the local polarization at different angular directions in a plane-parallel
atmospheres calculated for the range of effective temperatures of T dwarfs and
then average over the whole surface of the object. The effects of gravity and
limb darkening as well as rotation induced non-sphericity are included. It is
found that the amount of polarization decreases with the increase in effective
temperature. It is also found that significant polarization at any local point
in the atmosphere arises only in the optical (B-band). However, the disk
integrated polarization--even in the B-band--is negligible. Hence we conclude
that, unlike the case for cloudy L dwarfs, polarization of cloudless T-dwarfs
by atomic and molecular scattering may not be detectable.

restore particle interchanges. A new type of 2D particles--composite anyons is
also defined via unitary representations of cyclotron braid subgroups. It is
demonstrated that composite fermions and composite anyons are rightful 2D

also a new opportunity for non-Abelian composite anyons for topological quantum

dimension is zero for a given quantum number. Furthermore we find that non-zero
anomalous dimensions of other operators are all negative. These results predict
the functional form of the NN potential at short distance, which is a little
weaker than $r^{-2}$. On the other hand, the computation of the anomalous
dimension spectrum alone can not determine whether the potential is repulsive

that spectral evolution in dipping is well-described by absorption on the bulge

disk corona (ADC). This model is further supported by detection of a relatively
small, energy-independent decrease of flux above 20 keV due to Thomson
scattering. It is shown that this is consistent with the electron scattering
expected of the bulge plasma. We address the recent proposal that the dip

inconsistent with the extended nature of the ADC for which the evidence is now

accretion rate and thus the total source luminosity is falling. We detect

radio galaxies smoothly extend the relationships found for the more powerful
FRI radio galaxies between emission line, optical and radio nuclear
luminosities to lower levels. However, they have a deficit of a factor of ~100
in extended radio emission with respect to that of the classical example of
3CR/FRI. This is not due to their low luminosity, since we found radio galaxies
of higher radio core power, similar to those of 3CR/FRI, showing the same
behavior, i.e. lacking significant extended radio emission. Such sources form
the bulk of the population of radio-loud AGN in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
At a given level of nuclear emission, one can find radio sources with an
extremely wide range, a factor of >~100, of radio power. We argue that the
prevalence of sources with luminous extended radio structures in flux limited
samples is due to a selection bias, since the inclusion of such objects is
highly favored. The most studied catalogues of radio galaxies are thus composed
by the minority of radio-loud AGN that meet the physical conditions required to

mass-radius-age, and turnoff mass - age relations. The masses, radii, and
luminosities of the component stars are determined well enough that the

accretion, accretion via a geometrically thin, optically thick disk or an
advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF). The luminosity at transition between
these two states seems to vary from source to source, or even for the same
source during different outbursts, as observed for GX 339-4. We investigate how
the existence of an inner weak disk in the hard state affects the transition
luminosity. We evaluate the structure of the corona above an outer truncated
disk and the resulting disk evaporation rate for different irradiation. In some
cases, recent observations of X-ray transients indicate the presence of an
inner cool disk during the hard state. Such a disk can remain during quiescence
after the last outburst as long as the luminosity does not drop to very low
values (10^-4 to 10^-3 of the Eddington luminosity). Consequently, as part of
the matter accretes via the inner disk, the hard irradiation is reduced. The
hard irradiation is further reduced, occulted and partly reflected by the inner
disk. This leads to a hard-soft transition at a lower luminosity if an inner
disk exists below the ADAF. This seems to be supported by observations for GX
339-4.

reproduce both angular distributions and polarization data for small values of
the Mandelstam variable $u$, in contrast to previous analyses. The model

Mittag--Leffler ones in the definition of an infinite dimensional vector bundle
on a scheme $X$. Two questions arise: (1) What is the structure of the class
$\mathcal D$ of all flat Mittag--Leffler modules over a general ring? (2) Can
flat Mittag--Leffler modules be used to build a Quillen model category
structure on the category of all chain complexes of quasi--coherent sheaves on
$X$?
  We answer (1) by showing that a module $M$ is flat Mittag--Leffler, if and
only if $M$ is $\aleph_1$--projective in the sense of Eklof and Mekler. We use
this to characterize the rings such that $\mathcal D$ is closed under products,
and relate the classes of all Mittag--Leffler, strict Mittag--Leffler, and
separable modules. Then we prove that the class $\mathcal D$ is not
deconstructible for any non--right perfect ring. So unlike the classes of all
projective and flat modules, the class $\mathcal D$ does not admit the homotopy
theory tools developed recently by Hovey . This gives a negative answer to (2).

calculated and expressed as an expansion in the strength of the tidal coupling.
The expansion parameter is the inverse length scale R^{-1}, where R is the
radius of curvature of the external spacetime in which the black hole moves.
The expansion begins at order R^{-2}, and it is carried out through order
R^{-4}. The metric is parameterized by a number of tidal multipole moments,
which specify the black hole's tidal environment. The tidal moments are
freely-specifiable functions of time that are related to the Weyl tensor of the
external spacetime. The metric is presented in a light-cone coordinate system
that possesses a clear geometrical meaning: The advanced-time coordinate $v$ is
constant on past light cones that converge toward the black hole; the angles
theta and phi are constant on the null generators of each light cone; and the
radial coordinate r is an affine parameter on each generator, which decreases
as the light cones converge toward the black hole. The coordinates are
well-behaved on the black-hole horizon, and they are adjusted so that the
coordinate description of the horizon is the same as in the Schwarzschild
geometry: r = 2M. At the order of accuracy maintained in this work, the horizon
is a stationary null hypersurface foliated by apparent horizons; it is an
isolated horizon in the sense of Ashtekar and Krishnan. As an application of
our results we examine the induced geometry and dynamics of the horizon, and
calculate the rate at which the black-hole surface area increases as a result
of the tidal interaction.

for radical change in propulsion technologies is obvious to all actors,
irrespective of whether they originate from industry, politics or the general

convention in the automobile industries. This tension is currently giving rise
to a situation of stalemate in relation to alternative propulsion and fuel
technologies. We map the situation by means of a taxonomy of current and future
incremental and radical innovations. Based on in-depth field observation of
engineering and manufacturing in Germany, we present an innovation landscape in
the form of a two-dimensional matrix composed of propulsion innovations and
fuel innovations. We use mathematical models of hyperselection to develop a
rationale for escape strategies from the current lock-in into conventional
combustion-engine technology. Based on the heuristic guidance of these models,
we discuss several empirical cases in which buses act as pioneers in markets
for alternative propulsion vehicles. Neither the model nor the basic empirical
material used in this paper are new. Instead, we show that using mathematical
models as a kind of substratum on which empirical observations and theoretical
arguments can be ordered leads to new and partly unexpected insights into the
nature of socioeconomic innovations. We apply this approach to the case of new
driving technologies and argue that there is a 'third epistemic function' of
models in the continuum between data driven, exactly validated models at the
one extreme and a metaphoric use of models in thought experiments at the other.

dependence on quantum dot anisotropy and external lateral electric field is
presented. The effective exciton Hamiltonian including long range electron-hole
exchange interaction is derived within the k*p effective mass approximation
(EMA). The exchange matrix elements of the Hamiltonian are expressed explicitly
in terms of electron and hole envelope functions. The matrix element
responsible for the ""bright"" exciton splitting is identified and analyzed. An
excitonic fine structure for a model quantum dot with quasi- two-dimensional
anisotropic harmonic oscillator (2DLAHO) confining potential is analyzed as a
function of the shape anisotropy, size and applied lateral electric field.

INTEGRAL has provided new, exciting results in the soft gamma-ray energy range
(from a few keV to a few MeV). With the discovery of about 700 hard X-Ray
sources, it has changed our previous view of a sky composed of peculiar and
``monster'' sources. The new high energy sky is in fact full of a large variety
of normal, very energetic emitters, characterized by new accretion and
acceleration processes (see also IBIS cat4, Bird et al. 2009). If compared to
previous IBIS/ISGRI surveys it is clear that there is a continual increase in
the rate of discoveries of HMXB and AGN, including a variety of distant QSOs.
This is basically due to increased exposure away from the Galactic Plane, while
the percentage of sources without an identification has remained constant. At
the same time, about one GRB/month is detected and imaged by the two main
gamma-ray instruments on board: IBIS and SPI. INTEGRAL, after six and half
years of observations, has completed the Core Programme phase and is now fully
open to the scientific community for Open Time and Key Programme observations,
with AO7 recently announced by ESA. In this paper we review the major
achievements of the INTEGRAL Observatory in the field of Gamma Ray Bursts.

Jones. We will show, that if the time-zone delay is properly accounted for, the
two distinct markets largely merge into one. This is reflected by the largest
eigenvalue that develops a gap relative to the remaining, chaotic eigenvalues.
By extending investigations of the specific character of financial collectivity
we also discuss the criticality-analog phenomenon of the financial
log-periodicity and show specific examples.

effects on the single top productions induced by model-independent $tqg$
flavor-changing neutral-current couplings at hadron colliders. Our results show
that, for the $tcg$ coupling the NLO QCD corrections can enhance the total
cross sections by about 60% and 30%, and for the $tug$ coupling by about 50%
and 20% at the Tevatron and LHC, respectively, which means that the NLO
corrections can increase the experimental sensitivity to the FCNC couplings by
about 10%$-$30%. Moreover, the NLO corrections reduce the dependence of the
total cross sections on the renormalization or factorization scale
significantly, which lead to increased confidence on the theoretical
predictions. Besides, we also evaluate the NLO corrections to several important
kinematic distributions, and find that for most of them the NLO corrections are
almost the same and do not change the shape of the distributions.

ultracold photoassociation by two laser fields. Usually higher J states are
suppressed in photoassociation at ultracold temperatures in the regime of
Wigner threshold laws. We propose a scheme in which one strong laser field
drives photoassociation transition close to either J = 1 or J = 2 rotational
state of a particular vibrational level of an electronically excited molecule.
The other laser field is tuned near photoassociation resonance with J > 2
rotational levels of the same vibrational state. The strong laser field induces
a strong continnum-bound dipole coupling. The resulting dipole force between
two colliding atoms modifies the continnum states forming continnum-bound
dressed states with a significant component of higher partial waves in the
continnum configuration. When the second laser is scanned near the resonance of
the higher J states, these states become populated due to photoassociative
transitions from the modified continnum.
