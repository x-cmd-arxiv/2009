the Galactic planetary nebula (PN) census. We now know of ~3,000 PNe in the
Galaxy, but this is far short of most estimates, typically ~25,000 or more for
the total population. The size of the Galactic PN population is required to
derive an accurate estimate of the chemical enrichment rates of nitrogen,
carbon, and helium. In addition, a high PN count (~20,000) is strong evidence
that most 1-8 Msun main sequence stars will go through a PN phase, while a low
count (<10,000) argues that special conditions (e.g., a close binary
interaction) are required to form a PN. We describe a technique for finding
hundreds more PNe using the existing data collections of the digital sky
surveys, thereby improving the census of Galactic PNe.

presence of experimental restrictions on the hadronic final state and for
generic parton momentum fractions. At the scale Q of the hard interaction,
factorization does not yield standard parton distribution functions (PDFs) for
the initial state. The measurement restricting the hadronic final state
introduces a new scale \mu_B << Q and probes the proton prior to the hard
collision. This corresponds to evaluating the PDFs at the scale \mu_B. After
the proton is probed, the incoming hard parton is contained in an initial-state
jet, and the hard collision occurs between partons inside these jets rather
than inside protons. The proper description of such initial-state jets requires
""beam functions"". At the scale \mu_B, the beam function factorizes into a
convolution of calculable Wilson coefficients and PDFs. Below \mu_B, the
initial-state evolution is described by the usual PDF evolution which changes
x, while above \mu_B it is governed by a different renormalization group
evolution which sums double logarithms of \mu_B/Q and leaves x fixed. As an
example, we prove a factorization theorem for ""isolated Drell-Yan"", pp -> Xl+l-

information theory: determining the largest eigenvalue of a sum of p random
product states in (C^d)^{otimes k}, where k and p/d^k are fixed while d grows.
When k=1, the Marcenko-Pastur law determines (up to small corrections) not only
the largest eigenvalue ((1+sqrt{p/d^k})^2) but the smallest eigenvalue
(min(0,1-sqrt{p/d^k})^2) and the spectral density in between. We use the method
of moments to show that for k>1 the largest eigenvalue is still approximately
(1+sqrt{p/d^k})^2 and the spectral density approaches that of the
Marcenko-Pastur law, generalizing the random matrix theory result to the random
tensor case. Our bound on the largest eigenvalue has implications both for
sampling from a particular heavy-tailed distribution and for a recently
proposed quantum data-hiding and correlation-locking scheme due to Leung and
Winter. Since the matrices we consider have neither independent entries nor
unitary invariance, we need to develop new techniques for their analysis. The
main contribution of this paper is to give three different methods for
analyzing mixtures of random product states: a diagrammatic approach based on
Gaussian integrals, a combinatorial method that looks at the cycle
decompositions of permutations and a recursive method that uses a variant of
the Schwinger-Dyson equations.

imaging - undetected in the HST-ACS F814W image - in the gravitational lens
galaxy of SLACS SDSSJ0946+1006 (the ""Double Einstein Ring""). The detection is
based on a Bayesian grid reconstruction of the two-dimensional surface density
of the galaxy inside an annulus around its Einstein radius (few kpc). [...] We
confirm this detection by modeling the system including a parametric mass model
with a tidally truncated pseudo-Jaffe density profile; in that case the
substructure mass is M_sub=(3.51+-0.15)x10^9 Msun, located at
(-0.651+-0.038,1.040+-0.034)'', precisely where also the surface density map
shows a strong convergence peak. [...] We set a lower limit of (M/L)_V}>=120
(Msun/L}_V,sun (3-sigma) inside a sphere of 0.3 kpc centred on the substructure
(r_tidal=1.1kpc). The result is robust under substantial changes in the model
and the data-set (e.g. PSF, pixel number and scale, source and potential
regularization, rotations and galaxy subtraction). Despite being at the limits
of detectability, it can therefore not be attributed to obvious systematic
effects. Our detection implies a dark matter mass fraction at the radius of the
inner Einstein ring of f_CDM=2.15^{+2.05}_{-1.25} percent (68 percent C.L) in
the mass range 4x10^6 Msun to 4x10^9 Msun assuming alpha=1.9+-0.1 (with dN/dm ~
m^-alpha). Assuming a flat prior on alpha, between 1.0 and 3.0, increases this
to f_CDM=2.56^{+3.26}_{-1.50} percent (68 percent C.L). The likelihood ratio is
0.51 between our best value (f_CDM=0.0215) and that from simulations
(f_sim=0.003). Hence the inferred mass fraction, admittedly based on a single
lens system, is large but still consistent with predictions. [...]

harmonics. At the tree level, our results coincide with the results of Witten,
but there is a difference in the way the loop effects are implemented. In
Witten's approach, one has only take into account the fermion loops, which
bring about a negative shift of the (chosen positive at the tree level)
Chern-Simons coupling k. As a result, Witten index vanishes and supersymmetry
is broken at small k. In the effective BO Hamiltonian framework, fermion, gluon
and ghost loops contribute on an equal footing. Fermion loop contribution to
the effective Hamiltonian can be evaluated exactly, and their effect amounts to
the negative shift k -> k - h/2 for N =1 and k -> k - h for N = 2,3 in the
tree-level formulae for the index. In our approach, with rather natural
assumptions on the structure of bosonic corrections, the shift k -> k + h
brought about by the gluon loops also affects the index. Since the total shift
of k is positive or zero, Witten index appears to be nonzero at nonzero k, and
supersymmetry is not broken. We discuss possible reasons for such disagreement.

power-law scaling of event size distributions, which can be measured by linear
regression on logarithmic axes. We show here that such a procedure does not
necessarily mean that the system exhibits self-organized criticality. We first
provide an analysis of multisite local field potential (LFP) recordings of
brain activity and show that event size distributions defined as negative LFP
peaks can be close to power-law distributions. However, this result is not
robust to change in detection threshold, or when tested using more rigorous
statistical analyses such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Similar power-law
scaling is observed for surrogate signals, suggesting that power-law scaling
may be a generic property of thresholded stochastic processes. We next
investigate this problem analytically, and show that, indeed, stochastic
processes can produce spurious power-law scaling without the presence of
underlying self-organized criticality. However, this power-law is only apparent
in logarithmic representations, and does not survive more rigorous analysis
such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The same analysis was also performed on an
artificial network known to display self-organized criticality. In this case,
both the graphical representations and the rigorous statistical analysis reveal
with no ambiguity that the avalanche size is distributed as a power-law. We
conclude that logarithmic representations can lead to spurious power-law
scaling induced by the stochastic nature of the phenomenon. This apparent
power-law scaling does not constitute a proof of self-organized criticality,
which should be demonstrated by more stringent statistical tests.

hydrodynamic simulations into stellar evolution, convection at the surface and
sub-surface layers of the Sun is re-examined, from a restricted point of view,
in the language of mixing-length theory (MLT) . Requiring that MLT use a
hydrodynamically realistic dissipation length gives a new constraint on solar
models. While the stellar structure which results is similar to that obtained
by YREC and Garching models, the theoretical picture differs. A new
quantitative connection is made between macro-turbulence, micro-turbulence, and
the convective velocity scale at the photosphere, which has finite values. The
""geometric parameter"" in MLT is found to correspond more reasonably with the
size of the strong downward plumes which drive convection (Stein and Nordlund
1998), and thus has a physical interpretation even in MLT. Use of 3D
simulations of both adiabatic convection and stellar atmospheres will allow the
determination of the dissipation length and the geometric parameter (i.e., the
entropy jump), with no astronomical calibration.
  A physically realistic treatment of convection in stellar evolution will
require additional modifications beyond MLT, including effects of kinetic
energy flux, entrainment (the most dramatic difference from MLT found by Meakin
and Arnett 2007), rotation, and magnetic fields (Balbus 2009}.

such as the Planck length $\lambda_P$, so that it is not possible to measure a
position coordinate with accuracy smaller than this fundamental length. It is
therefore necessary to investigate the formulation of quantum mechanics using
only discrete variables as coordinates. To investigate all of quantum mechanics
or any branch of physics from this approach is of course a daunting task and
thus it is worthwhile to consider a specific simple problem in order to
formulate the basic ideas. In this note we compare the solutions of Schrodinger
equation for one-dimensional free particle under the usual space-time continuum
with those that are obtained when space-time is assumed to be quantized using a
simple model. For this purpose, we replace the derivatives occurring in
Schrodinger equation with the corresponding discrete derivatives. We compute
the probability density (and the probability current) under the two scenarios;
they turn out to be quite different in the two cases. We also obtain the
operator identity for the commutator $[p,x]^q$ under the assumption of
quantized space-time and contrast it with the usual commutator $[p,x]$.

that it contradicts with the basic premise of natural selection. Favoring
players with higher fitness, the latter is key for understanding the challenges
faced by cooperators when competing with defectors. Evolutionary game theory
provides a competent theoretical framework for addressing the subtleties of
cooperation in such situations, which are known as social dilemmas. Recent
advances point towards the fact that the evolution of strategies alone may be
insufficient to fully exploit the benefits offered by cooperative behavior.
Indeed, while spatial structure and heterogeneity, for example, have been
recognized as potent promoters of cooperation, coevolutionary rules can extend
the potentials of such entities further, and even more importantly, lead to the
understanding of their emergence. The introduction of coevolutionary rules to
evolutionary games implies, that besides the evolution of strategies, another
property may simultaneously be subject to evolution as well. Coevolutionary
rules may affect the interaction network, the reproduction capability of
players, their reputation, mobility or age. Here we review recent works on
evolutionary games incorporating coevolutionary rules, as well as give a
didactic description of potential pitfalls and misconceptions associated with
the subject. In addition, we briefly outline directions for future research
that we feel are promising, thereby particularly focusing on dynamical effects
of coevolutionary rules on the evolution of cooperation, which are still widely
open to research and thus hold promise of exciting new discoveries.

Using recent results of random matrix theory, a practical way to evaluate the
threshold and the $p$-value of the test is provided in the asymptotic regime
where the number $K$ of sensors and the number $N$ of observations per sensor
are large but have the same order of magnitude. The theoretical performance of
the test is then analyzed in terms of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)
curve. It is in particular proved that both Type I and Type II error
probabilities converge to zero exponentially as the dimensions increase at the
same rate, and closed-form expressions are provided for the error exponents.
These theoretical results rely on a precise description of the large deviations
of the largest eigenvalue of spiked random matrix models, and establish that
the presented test asymptotically outperforms the popular test based on the

Both the redshift distribution and cumulative number counts of X-ray sources
reveal little evidence to suggest that the system contains X-ray luminous
active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in excess to what is observed in the field
population. If preprocessing is under way in the Cl0023 system, our
observations suggest that powerful nuclear activity is not the predominant
mechanism quenching star formation and driving the evolution of Cl0023
galaxies. We speculate that this is due to a lack of sufficiently massive
nuclear black holes required to power such activity, as previous observations
have found a high late-type fraction among the Cl0023 population. It may be
that disruptive AGN-driven outflows become an important factor in the
preprocessing of galaxy populations only during a later stage in the evolution
of such groups and structures when sufficiently massive galaxies (and central
black holes) have built up, but prior to hydrodynamical processes stripping
them of their gas reservoirs.

a strong decrease with increasing local density, similar to the relation at
z~0. Our result contrasts with other work at z~1 that find the SFR-density
trend to reverse for luminosity-limited samples. These other results appear to
be driven by star-formation in lower mass systems (M~10^{10} M_sun). Our
results imply that the processes that shut down star-formation are present in
groups and other dense regions in the field. Our data also suggest that the
lower SFRs of galaxies in higher density environments may reflect a change in
the ratio of star-forming to non-star-forming galaxies, rather than a change in
SFRs. As a consequence, the SFRs of star-forming galaxies, in environments
ranging from small groups to clusters, appear to be similar and largely
unaffected by the local processes that truncate star-formation at z~0.8.

telescope, is rich in absorption features from the gas and massive stars in
this galaxy. The interstellar absorption lines are resolved into two components
of approximately equal strength and each spanning several hundred km/s in
velocity. One component has a net blueshift of -70 km/s relative to the stars
and H II regions and presumably arises in a galaxy-scale outflow similar to
those seen in most star-forming galaxies at z = 2-3. The other is more unusual
in showing a mean redshift of +350 km/s relative to the systemic redshift;
possible interpretations include a merging clump, or material ejected by a
previous star formation episode and now falling back onto the galaxy, or more
simply a chance alignment with a foreground galaxy. In the metal absorption
lines, both components only partially cover the OB stars against which they are
being viewed. We tentatively associate the redshifted component with the strong
damped Lyman alpha line, indicative of a column density N(H I) = (3.0 +/- 0.8)

find that the young stellar population of the Cosmic Eye is essentially
indistinguishable from those of the Cosmic Horseshoe and MS 1512-cB58, while
the interstellar spectra of all three galaxies are markedly different,
attesting to the real complexity of the interplay between starbursts and
ambient interstellar matter in young galaxies (abridged).

inference that is not possible with the well observed acoustic modes (or p

Using a self-consistent 1-D viscous disc model, we show that the ratio of local
cooling to dynamical timescales Omega*tcool has a strong dependence on the
local temperature. We investigate the effects of temperature-dependent cooling
functions on the disc's gravitational stability through controlled numerical
experiments using an SPH code. We find that such cooling functions raise the
susceptibility of discs to fragmentation through the influence of temperature
perturbations - the average value of Omega*tcool has to increase to prevent
local variability leading to collapse. We find the effects of temperature
dependence to be most significant in the ""opacity gap"" associated with dust
sublimation, where the average value of Omega*tcool at fragmentation is
increased by over an order of magnitude. We then use this result to predict
where protoplanetary discs will fragment into bound objects, in terms of radius
and accretion rate. We find that without temperature dependence, for radii <
~10AU a very large accretion rate ~10^-3 Msun/yr is required for fragmentation,
but that this is reduced to 10^-4 Msun/yr with temperature-dependent cooling.

a small aperture telescope with a wide field of view (FOV). It is dedicated to
searching for stellar variability within the target fields of the CoRoT space
mission to aid in minimizing false-alarm rates and identify potential targets
for additional science. The LRa1 field is CoRoT's second long run field located
in the galactic anticenter direction. We observed the LRa1 stellar field on 23
nights between November and March 2005/2006. From 6099 stars marked as
variable, 39 were classified as periodic variable stars and 27 of them are
within the CoRoT FOV. We also confirmed the variability for four stars listed
in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars (GCVS).

brings up the question whether an X-ray cool core is always required for radio
feedback. We present a systematic analysis of 152 groups and clusters to show
that every BCG with a strong radio AGN has an X-ray cool core. Those strong
radio AGNs in the center of the ""noncool core"" systems identified before are in
fact associated with small X-ray cool cores with typical radii of < 5 kpc (we
call them coronae). Small coronae are most likely of ISM origin and they carry
enough fuel to power radio AGNs. Our results suggest that the traditional cool
core/noncool core dichotomy is too simple. A better alternative is the cool
core distribution function with the enclosed X-ray luminosity. Other
implications of our results are also discussed, including a warning on the
simple extrapolation of the density profile to derive Bondi accretion rate.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study of GO sheets annealed at various

accompanied by the reduction of GO with decreases in oxygen levels from ~28% in
as-made GO down to ~2% in 1100C NH3 reacted GO. XPS analysis of the N binding
configurations of doped GO finds pyridinic N in the doped samples, with
increased quaternary N (N that replaced the carbon atoms in the graphene plane)
in GO annealed at higher temperatures (>900C). Oxygen groups in GO were found
responsible for reactions with NH3 and C-N bond formation. Pre-reduced GO with
fewer oxygen groups by thermal annealing in H2 exhibits greatly reduced
reactivity with NH3 and lower N-doping level. Electrical measurements of
individual GO sheet devices demonstrate that GO annealed in NH3 exhibits higher
conductivity than those annealed in H2, suggesting more effective reduction of
GO by annealing in NH3 than in H2, consistent with XPS data. The N-doped
reduced GO shows clearly n-type electron doping behavior with Dirac point (DP)

objects located in the 1:1 and the 3:2 mean motion resonances with Neptune,
respectively, and therefore protected from close encounters with the planet.
However, the orbits of these two kinds of objects may cross very often,
allowing a higher collisional rate between them than with other kinds of
trans-Neptunian objects, and a consequent size distribution modification of the
two subpopulations.
  Observational colors and absolute magnitudes of Neptune Trojans and Plutinos
show that i) there are no intrinsically bright (large) Plutinos at small
inclinations, ii) there is an apparent excess of blue and intrinsically faint
(small) Plutinos, and iii) Neptune Trojans possess the same blue colors as
Plutinos within the same (estimated) size range do.
  For the present subpopulations we analyzed the most favorable conditions for
close encounters/collisions and address any link there could be between those
encounters and the sizes and/or colors of Plutinos and Neptune Trojans. We also
performed a simultaneous numerical simulation of the outer Solar System over 1
Gyr for all these bodies in order to estimate their collisional rate.
  We conclude that orbital overlap between Neptune Trojans and Plutinos is
favored for Plutinos with large libration amplitudes, high eccentricities, and
small inclinations. Additionally, with the assumption that the collisions can
be disruptive creating smaller objects not necessarily with similar colors, the
present high concentration of small Plutinos with small inclinations can thus
be a consequence of a collisional interaction with Neptune Trojans and such
hypothesis should be further analyzed.

nearest-neighbors, each agent has a certain probability $p$ to interact with a
virtual neighbor whose cultural features are fixed from the outset. Most

was the first to consider this problem, and the solutions given in his PhD
thesis were in the domain of automata theory. Our goal is to address the issue
of inexact synchronisation in a process algebra setting, because we get
concepts like modularity and abstraction for free, which are useful to further
analyze the synthesised system. In this paper, we propose four methods to check
a closed loop system in an asynchronous setting such that it is branching
bisimilar to the modified (asynchronous) closed loop system. We modify a given
closed loop system by introducing buffers either in the plant models, the
supervisor models, or the output channels of both supervisor and plant models,
or in the input channels of both supervisor and plant models. A notion of
desynchronisable closed loop system is introduced, which is a class of
synchronous closed loop systems such that they are branching bisimilar to their
corresponding asynchronous versions. Finally we study different case studies in
an asynchronous setting and then try to summarise the observations (or
conditions) which will be helpful in order to formulate a theory of
desynchronisable closed loop systems.

test case to examine the age distribution of an archetypal cluster population

considered typical of solar-type stars. Our highly differential elemental
abundance analysis of unprecedented accuracy (~0.01 dex) of the Sun relative to
solar twins, shows that the Sun has a peculiar chemical composition with a ~20%
depletion of refractory elements relative to the volatile elements in
comparison with solar twins. The abundance differences correlate strongly with
the condensation temperatures of the elements. A similar study of solar analogs
from planet surveys shows that this peculiarity also holds in comparisons with
solar analogs known to have close-in giant planets while the majority of solar
analogs without detected giant planets show the solar abundance pattern. The
peculiarities in the solar chemical composition can be explained as signatures
of the formation of terrestrial planets like our own Earth.

sine-Gordon model as a primary example. We suggest a unified approach to sudden
and slow quenches, where the tuning parameter $\lambda(t)$ changes in time as
$\lambda(t)\sim \upsilon t^r$, based on the adiabatic expansion of the
excitation probability in powers of $\upsilon$. We show that the universal
scaling of the excitation probability can be understood through the singularity
of the generalized adiabatic susceptibility $\chi_{2r+2}(\lambda)$, which for
sudden quenches ($r=0$) reduces to the fidelity susceptibility. In turn this
class of susceptibilities is expressed through the moments of the connected
correlation function of the quench operator. We analyze the excitations created
after a sudden quench of the cosine potential using a combined approach of
form-factors expansion and conformal perturbation theory for the low-energy and
high-energy sector respectively. We find the general scaling laws for the
probability of exciting the system, the density of excited quasiparticles, the
entropy and the heat generated after the quench. In the two limits where the
sine-Gordon model maps to hard core bosons and free massive fermions we provide
the exact solutions for the quench dynamics and discuss the finite temperature
generalizations.

guaranteed contract is a deal between a publisher and an advertiser to allocate
a certain number of impressions over a certain period, for a pre-specified
price per impression. However, as spot markets for display ads, such as the
RightMedia Exchange, have grown in prominence, the selection of advertisements
to show on a given page is increasingly being chosen based on price, using an
auction. As the number of participants in the exchange grows, the price of an
impressions becomes a signal of its value. This correlation between price and

offer the contract buyer a range of prices, and not just the cheapest
impressions necessary to fulfill its demand.
  Implementing a contract using a range of prices, is akin to creating a mutual

apparent paucity of dark matter in such objects, indicating the need for a

claim, with the largest spectral samples ever obtained of 47 Tucanae and M55.
Furthermore, this large sample allows for an accurate metallicity calibration

magnitude of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch. Assuming an isothermal
distribution, the rotations of each cluster are also measured with both
clusters exhibiting clear rotation signatures. The global velocity dispersions

also calculated. By applying a simple dynamical model to the velocity
dispersion profiles of 47 Tuc and M55, we calculate their mass-to-light
profiles, total masses and central velocity dispersions. We find no
statistically significant flattening of the velocity dispersion at large radii
for M55, and a marked increase in the profile of 47 Tuc for radii greater than
approximately half the tidal radius. We interpret this increase as an
evaporation signature, indicating that 47 Tuc is undergoing, or has undergone,

cannot have persisted over a Hubble time. The central constant-entropy
temperature peak recently observed in the innermost 150 parsecs is explained by
compressive heating as gas flows toward the central massive black hole. Since
the cooling time of this gas is only a few million years, NGC 4649 provides the
most acutely concentrated known example of the cooling flow problem in which
the time-integrated apparent mass that has flowed into the galactic core
exceeds the total mass observed there. This paradox can be resolved by
intermittent outflows of energy or mass driven by accretion energy released
near the black hole. Inflowing gas is also required at intermediate kpc radii
to explain the ellipticity of X-ray isophotes due to spin-up by mass ejected by
stars that rotate with the galaxy and to explain local density and temperature
profiles. We provide evidence that many luminous elliptical galaxies undergo
similar inflow spin-up. A small turbulent viscosity is required in NGC 4649 to
avoid forming large X-ray luminous disks that are not observed, but the
turbulent pressure is small and does not interfere with mass determinations

transmitter (ICOCT) where ""cognitive"" is defined from both the noncausal and
causal perspectives. For the noncausal ICOCT, referred to as interference
channels with degraded message sets (IC-DMS), we propose a new achievable rate
region that generalizes existing achievable rate regions for IC-DMS. In the
absence of the noncognitive transmitter, the proposed region coincides with
Marton's region for the broadcast channel. Based on this result, the capacity
region of a class of semi-deterministic IC-DMS is established. For the causal
ICOCT, due to the complexity of the channel model, we focus primarily on the
cognitive Z interference channel (ZIC), where the interference link from the
cognitive transmitter to the primary receiver is assumed to be absent due to
practical design considerations. Capacity bounds for such channels in different
parameter regimes are obtained and the impact of such causal cognitive ability
is carefully studied. In particular, depending on the channel parameters, the
cognitive link may not be useful in terms of enlarging the capacity region. An
optimal corner point of the capacity region is also established for the
cognitive ZIC for a certain parameter regime.

of HMMs that can model smooth state evolution as in Linear Dynamical Systems
(LDSs) as well as non-log-concave predictive distributions as in
continuous-observation HMMs. RR-HMMs assume an m-dimensional latent state and n
discrete observations, with a transition matrix of rank k <= m. This implies
the dynamics evolve in a k-dimensional subspace, while the shape of the set of
predictive distributions is determined by m. Latent state belief is represented
with a k-dimensional state vector and inference is carried out entirely in R^k,
making RR-HMMs as computationally efficient as k-state HMMs yet more
expressive. To learn RR-HMMs, we relax the assumptions of a recently proposed
spectral learning algorithm for HMMs (Hsu, Kakade and Zhang 2009) and apply it
to learn k-dimensional observable representations of rank-k RR-HMMs. The
algorithm is consistent and free of local optima, and we extend its performance
guarantees to cover the RR-HMM case. We show how this algorithm can be used in
conjunction with a kernel density estimator to efficiently model
high-dimensional multivariate continuous data. We also relax the assumption
that single observations are sufficient to disambiguate state, and extend the
algorithm accordingly. Experiments on synthetic data and a toy video, as well
as on a difficult robot vision modeling problem, yield accurate models that
compare favorably with standard alternatives in simulation quality and
prediction capability.

bound on the length of an s.a.p. on an elliptic curve in Weierstrass form over
Q. We show that 4319 is such a bound for curves over R. This is done by
considering translates of the curve in a grid as a graph. A simple upper bound
is found for the number of crossings and the 'crossing inequality' gives a
lower bound. Together these bound the length of an s.a.p. on the curve. We then
use a similar method to extend the result to arbitrary real algebraic curves.
Instead of considering s.a.p.'s we consider k^2/3 points in a grid. The number
of crossings is bounded by Bezout's Theorem. We then give another proof using a
result of Jarnik bounding the number of grid points on a convex curve. This
result applies as any real algebraic curve can be broken up into convex and
concave parts, the number of which depend on the degree. Lastly, these results
are extended to complex algebraic curves.

formed by some detailed structure theorems for the `characteristic factors'

distinct phases of development, separated by the discovery of some new
technical results in Moore's cohomology theory for locally compact groups
(arXiv:1004.4937). That discovery enabled a significant improvement to the main
structure theorem (Theorem 1.1 in (arXiv:0905.0518)), which in turn afforded a
much shortened proof of convergence. However, since the proof of convergence
using the original structure theorem required some quite different ideas that

As observed by Granovetter's seminal study, the proportion of jobs obtained
through social contacts is usually large compared to those obtained through
postings or agencies. At the same time, job markets are a natural example of
two-sided matching markets. An important solution concept in such markets is
that of stable matchings, and the use of the celebrated Gale-Shapley algorithm
to compute them. So far, the literature has evolved separately, either focusing
on the implications of information flowing through a social network, or on
developing a mathematical theory of job markets through the use of two-sided
matching techniques.
  In this paper we provide a model of the job market that brings both aspects
of job markets together. To model the social scientists' observations, we
assume that workers learn only about positions in firms through social
contacts. Given that information structure, we study both static properties of
what we call locally stable matchings (i.e., stable matchings subject to
informational constraints given by a social network) and dynamic properties
through a reinterpretation of Gale-Shapley's algorithm as myopic best response
dynamics.
  We prove that, in general, the set of locally stable matching strictly
contains that of stable matchings and it is in fact NP-complete to determine if
they are identical. We also show that the lattice structure of stable matchings
is in general absent. Finally, we focus on myopic best response dynamics
inspired by the Gale-Shapley algorithm. We study the efficiency loss due to the
informational constraints, providing both lower and upper bounds.

medium to the estimator and transmission is bit and power budgeted. Under the
assumption of conditional Gaussianity of the signal process at the estimator
(which may be ensured by observation packet acknowledgements), the conditional
prediction error covariance of the optimum mean-squared error filter is shown
to evolve according to a random dynamical system (RDS) on the space of
non-negative definite matrices. Our RDS formalism does not depend on the
particular medium access protocol (randomized) and, under a minimal distributed
observability assumption, we show that the sequence of random conditional
prediction error covariance matrices converges in distribution to a unique
invariant distribution (independent of the initial filter state), i.e., the
conditional error process is shown to be ergodic. Under broad assumptions on
the medium access protocol, we show that the conditional error covariance
sequence satisfies a Markov-Feller property, leading to an explicit
characterization of the support of its invariant measure. The methodology
adopted in this work is sufficiently general to envision this application to
sample path analysis of more general hybrid or switched systems, where existing
analysis is mostly moment-based.

crosscorrelating wavefields are revealed using rigorous mathematical theory on
integral equations. The previous practice on extracting the Green function by
crosscorrelating the wavefields recorded at two locations produced by the same
source and then summing such crosscorrelations over all sources on a boundary
is inadequate and has limitations in recovering the low frequency content in
the Green function. To recover the exact Green function, we need crosscorrelate
the wavefields observed at the two locations generated by different sources,
respectively. The crosscorrelation structure can be viewed as a matrix in the
discrete case or an integral operator in the continuous case. The previous
Green function retrieval method corresponds to the identity matrix multiplying
a constant. If the matrix is diagonal, the wavefield crosscorrelation is still
within the wavefield due to the same source but different weighting should be
applied for different sources. We have derived analytically the
crosscorrelation kernels for two important cases, the plane boundary and the
circular boundary, and both kernels are symmetrical difference kernels, which
correspond to convolutional operations. For high frequency waves or far-field
sources, the kernels reduce to the know result which is the Dirac delta
distribution (or an identity matrix). For other boundaries of general geometric
shapes, numerical schemes like the boundary element method can be used to solve
for the kernel matrix.

G292.0+1.8 using six IRC and four FIS bands covering 2.7-26.5 um and 50-180 um,
respectively. The AKARI images show two prominent structures; a bright
equatorial ring structure and an outer elliptical shell structure. The
equatorial ring structure is clumpy and incomplete with its western end opened.
The outer shell is almost complete and slightly squeezed along the north-south
direction. The central position of the outer shell is ~ 1' northwest from the
embedded pulsar and coincides with the center of the equatorial ring structure.
The equatorial ring and the elliptical shell structures were partly visible in
optical and/or X-rays, but they are much more clearly revealed in our AKARI
images. There is no evident difference in infrared colors of the two prominent
structures, which is consistent with the previous proposition that both
structures are of circumstellar origin. However, we have detected faint
infrared emission of a considerably high 15 to 24 um ratio associated with the
supernova ejecta in the southeastern and northwestern areas. Our IRC spectra
show that the high ratio is at least partly due to the emission lines from Ne
ions in the supernova ejecta material. In addition we detect a narrow,
elongated feature outside the SNR shell. We derive the physical parameters of
the infrared-emitting dust grains in the shocked circumstellar medium and
compare the result with model calculations of dust destruction by a SN shock.
The AKARI results suggest that the progenitor was at the center of the infrared
circumstellar shell in red supergiant stage and that the observed asymmetry in
the SN ejecta could be a result of either a dense circumstellar medium in the
equatorial plane and/or an asymmetric explosion.

homogeneous, gravitational field are discussed using the Rindler metric to
model the gravitational field. Some previously known results are obtained by
simpler and more transparent procedures and are interpreted in an intuitive
manner. Specifically: (i) We show that the electrostatic potential of a charge
at rest in the Rindler frame is expressible as A_0=(q/l) where l is the affine
parameter distance along the null geodesic from the charge to the field point.
(ii) We obtain the sum of the electrostatic forces exerted by one charge on
another in the Rindler frame and discuss its interpretation. (iii) We show how
a purely electrostatic term in the Rindler frame appears as a radiation term in
the inertial frame. (In part, this arises because charges at rest in a weak
gravitational field possess additional weight due to their electrostatic
energy. This weight is proportional to the acceleration and falls inversely
with distance -- which are the usual characteristics of a radiation field.)
(iv) We also interpret the origin of the radiation reaction term by extending
our approach to include a slowly varying acceleration. Many of these results
might have possible extensions for the case of electrostatics in an arbitrary
static geometry. [Abridged Abstract]

long periods of strong cooperation interrupted by sudden episodes of
predominant defection, suggesting a possible mechanism for the systemic failure

in the study of evolutionary ethics. Reciprocal altruism is one of explanations

Emergence of cooperation was demonstrated for prisoner's dilemma on a lattice
with synchronous update [Nature, 359, 826 (1992)]. However, the cooperation
disappeared for asynchronous update and the general validity of the conclusions
was questioned [PNAS, 90, 7716 (1993)]. Neither synchronous nor asynchronous
updates are realistic for natural systems. In this paper, we make a detailed

updated at every time instant. We observe a transition from all-defector state
to a mixed state as a function of p. Despite being transition from absorbing
state, our studies indicate that it is a first order transition. Furthermore,

the solar atmosphere, Alfven waves receive special attention. Indeed, these
waves constitute an attractive heating agent due to their ability to carry over
the many different layers of the solar atmosphere sufficient energy to heat and
maintain a corona. However, due to their incompressible nature these waves need
a mechanism such as mode conversion (leading to shock heating), phase mixing,
resonant absorption or turbulent cascade in order to heat the plasma. New
observations with polarimetric, spectroscopic and imaging instruments such as
those on board of the japanese satellite Hinode, or the SST or CoMP, are
bringing strong evidence for the existence of energetic Alfven waves in the
solar corona. In order to assess the role of Alfven waves in coronal heating,
in this work we model a magnetic flux tube being subject to Alfven wave heating
through the mode conversion mechanism. Using a 1.5-dimensional MHD code we
carry out a parameter survey varying the magnetic flux tube geometry (length
and expansion), the photospheric magnetic field, the photospheric velocity
amplitudes and the nature of the waves (monochromatic or white noise spectrum).
It is found that independently of the photospheric wave amplitude and magnetic
field a corona can be produced and maintained only for long (> 80 Mm) and thick
(area ratio between photosphere and corona > 500) loops. Above a critical value
of the photospheric velocity amplitude (generally a few km/s) the corona can no
longer be maintained over extended periods of time and collapses due to the
large momentum of the waves. These results establish several constraints on
Alfven wave heating as a coronal heating mechanism, especially for active

nuclei (AGNs) with a small scattering fraction selected from the Second
XMM-Newton Serendipitous Source Catalogue using hardness ratios. They are
candidates of buried AGNs, since a scattering fraction, which is a fraction of
scattered emission by the circumnuclear photoionized gas with respect to direct
emission, can be used to estimate the size of the opening part of an obscuring
torus. Their X-ray spectra are modeled by a combination of a power law with a
photon index of 1.5-2 absorbed by a column density of 10^23-24 cm^-2, an
unabsorbed power law, narrow Gaussian lines, and some additional soft
components. We find that scattering fractions of 20 among 22 objects are less
than a typical value (3%) for Seyfert2s observed so far. In particular, those
of eight objects are smaller than 0.5%, which are in the range for buried AGNs
found in recent hard X-ray surveys. Moreover, [O III] lambda5007 luminosities
at given X-ray luminosities for some objects are smaller than those for
Seyfert2s previously known. This fact could be interpreted as a smaller size of
optical narrow emission line regions produced in the opening direction of the
obscuring torus. These results indicate that they are strong candidates for the
AGN buried in a very geometrically thick torus.

$\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$ are coupling parameters with dimensions of
length-squared. In general, field equations of the theory contain third
derivatives of $g_{\mu\nu}$ and $\phi$. However, in the case
$-2\kappa_1=\kappa_2\equiv\kappa$ the derivative coupling term reads $\kappa
G_{\mu\nu}\phi^{,mu}\phi^{,\nu}$ and the order of corresponding field equations
is reduced up to second one. Assuming $-2\kappa_1=\kappa_2$, we study the
spatially-flat Friedman-Robertson-Walker model with a scale factor $a(t)$ and
find new exact cosmological solutions. It is shown that properties of the model
at early stages crucially depends on the sign of $\kappa$. For negative
$\kappa$ the model has an initial cosmological singularity, i.e. $a(t)\sim
(t-t_i)^{2/3}$ in the limit $t\to t_i$; and for positive $\kappa$ the universe
at early stages has the quasi-de Sitter behavior, i.e. $a(t)\sim e^{Ht}$ in the
limit $t\to-\infty$, where $H=(3\sqrt{\kappa})^{-1}$. The corresponding scalar
field $\phi$ is exponentially growing at $t\to-\infty$, i.e. $\phi(t)\sim
e^{-t/\sqrt{\kappa}}$. At late stages the universe evolution does not depend on
$\kappa$ at all; namely, for any $\kappa$ one has $a(t)\sim t^{1/3}$ at
$t\to\infty$. Summarizing, we conclude that a cosmological model with
nonminimal derivative coupling of the form $\kappa

quasi-de Sitter phase and an exit from it without any fine-tuned potential.

s-wave symmetry and find similar results in both cases, consistent with the
pseudogap being an effect of local pair correlations. We suggest that this

reused in metric similarity search as a ""multi-example"" query type. When
applied on a multi-dimensional database (i.e., on a multi-attribute table), the
traditional skyline operator selects all database objects that are not
dominated by other objects. The metric skyline query adopts the skyline
operator such that the multiple attributes are represented by distances
(similarities) to multiple query examples. Hence, we can view the metric
skyline as a set of representative database objects which are as similar to all
the examples as possible and, simultaneously, are semantically distinct. In
this paper we propose a technique of processing the metric skyline query by use
of PM-tree, while we show that our technique significantly outperforms the
original M-tree based implementation in both time and space costs. In

necessary to reproduce the HBT radius Rlong.

bound and a lower bound of this rank are derived. In particular, it is proven
that the tensor rank of $\ket{W}^{\otimes 2}$ is seven, thus resolving a
previously open problem. Some implications of this result are discussed in

reduction was performed with the standard procedure. We classified them by
means of comparison with published atlases. We performed SED fitting in order
to refine the spectral classification. The two counterparts clearly exhibit the
typical features of late-type stars, notably strong CO absorption bands in the
red part of the spectrum. With information from previous X-ray studies, we
classify the two systems as two new members of the SyXB class. For IGR
J16393-4643, we considered the most probable counterpart to the system,
although three other objects cannot be completely discarded. For this system,
we compared our findings with available orbital solutions, constraining the
orbital parameters and the mass of the companion star. By including two more

colors and properties. We found that X-ray selected (L_X>10^{42} erg s^{-1})

infrared continuum; the latter would not have been selected as AGN from
infrared diagnostics. The host galaxies of X-ray selected obscured AGN are all

stars (1/SSFR<t_{Hubble}) in dusty environments. The median L/LEdd value of the
active nucleus is between 2% and 10% depending on the assumed M_{BH}/M_{*}

the stellar mass up to a value of ~30% at z>1 and M_*>3x10^{11} M_sun, a
fraction significantly higher than in the local Universe for AGN of similar

rate of $\dot P_{orb}/P_{orb} =-3.402(7) \times 10^{-6}$ yr$^{-1}$ which is

studies, we construct a $\sim 30$ year long pulse period history of the source.
We show that frequency derivative shows long (i.e. more than a few years) and
short (i.e. order of days) term fluctuations. From the spectral analysis, we
found that all spectral parameters except Hydrogen column density showed no
significant variation with time and X-ray flux. Hydrogen column density is
found to be higher as X-ray flux gets lower. This may be due to the increase in
soft absorption when the pulsar is partially obscured as in Her X-1 or may just
be an artifact of the tail of a soft excess in energy spectrum.

about the hypothesis set: it is a vectorial space, it is a set of pointwise
defined functions, and the evaluation functional on this set is a continuous
mapping. Based on these principles an original theory is developed generalizing
the notion of reproduction kernel Hilbert space to non hilbertian sets. Then it
is shown that the hypothesis set of any learning machine has to be a
generalized reproducing set. Therefore, thanks to a general ""representer

a kernel. Furthermore, a way to design these kernels is given. To illustrate
this framework some examples of such reproducing sets and kernels are given.

the density and temperature structure of protostellar envelopes and molecular
outflows. We aim to characterize the properties of the protostellar envelope,
molecular outflow and surrounding cloud, through observations of high
excitation molecular lines within a sample of 16 southern sources presumed to
be embedded YSOs. Observations of submillimeter lines of CO, HCO+ and their
isotopologues, both single spectra and small maps were taken with the FLASH and
APEX-2a instruments mounted on APEX to trace the gas around the sources. The
HARP-B instrument on the JCMT was used to map IRAS 15398-3359 in these lines.
HCO+ mapping probes the presence of dense centrally condensed gas, a
characteristic of protostellar envelopes. The rare isotopologues C18O and
H13CO+ are also included to determine the optical depth, column density, and
source velocity. The combination of multiple CO transitions, such as 3-2, 4-3
and 7-6, allows to constrain outflow properties, in particular the temperature.
Archival submillimeter continuum data are used to determine envelope masses.
Eleven of the sixteen sources have associated warm and/or dense quiescent as
characteristic of protostellar envelopes, or an associated outflow. Using the
strength and degree of concentration of the HCO+ 4-3 and CO 4-3 lines as a
diagnostic, five sources classified as Class I based on their spectral energy
distributions are found not to be embedded YSOs. The C18O 3-2 lines show that
for none of the sources, foreground cloud layers are present. Strong molecular
outflows are found around six sources, .. (continued in paper)

muon beam. The muons will be produced by the decay of pions from a target
dipping into the ISIS proton beam at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL). The
channel includes liquid-hydrogen absorbers providing transverse and
longitudinal momentum loss and high-gradient radiofrequency (RF) cavities for
longitudinal reacceleration, all packed into a solenoidal magnetic channel.
MICE will reduce the beam transverse emittance by about 10% for muon momenta
between 140 and 240 MeV/c. Time-of-flight (TOF) counters, a threshold Cherenkov
counter, and a calorimeter will identify background electrons and pions.
Spectrometers before and after the cooling section will measure the beam
transmission and input and output emittances with an absolute precision of
0.1%.

of harmonic morphisms from a 3-dimensional Euclidean or pseudo-Euclidean space

complex-harmonic morphism between complex-Riemannian manifolds and showing how
these are given by bicomplex-holomorphic functions when the codomain is
one-bicomplex dimensional. By taking real slices, we recover well-known
compactifications for the three possible real cases. On the way, we discuss
some interesting conformal compactifications of complex-Riemannian manifolds by
interpreting them as bicomplex manifolds.

properties which open the pathway for an intriguing many-body dynamics taking
place in Rydberg gases consisting of either matter or anti-matter systems. We
review both the foundations and recent developments of the field in the cold
and ultracold regime where trapping and cooling of Rydberg atoms have become
possible. Exotic states of moving Rydberg atoms such as giant dipole states are
discussed in detail, including their formation mechanisms in a strongly
magnetized cold plasma. Inhomogeneous field configurations influence the
electronic structure of Rydberg atoms, and we describe the utility of
corresponding effects for achieving tightly trapped ultracold Rydberg atoms. We
review recent work on large, extended cold Rydberg gases in magnetic fields and
their formation in strongly magnetized ultracold plasmas through collisional
recombination. Implications of these results for current antihydrogen
production experiments are pointed out, and techniques for trapping and cooling
of such atoms are investigated.

glassy polymers are separated by examining mixtures of chains with different
lengths. Simulations show that the orientation of a molecule of a given chain
length is the same in monodisperse systems and bidisperse mixtures, even when
entangled and unentangled chains are mixed. In addition, the stress in mixtures
is equal to the weighted average of the stresses in monodisperse systems. These
results indicate that chains contribute independently to strain hardening, that
chain orientation is determined by local interactions with the surrounding
glass, and that entanglements play at most an indirect role in strain hardening
in the range of strains typically studied. We discuss these results in the
context of recent microscopic theories.

become important. This crossover is accompanied with a change of the domain

Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson playing the role of an inflaton with a strong
non-minimal coupling to gravity. At the one-loop level with the running of
constants taken into account, it leads to a range of the Higgs mass that is
entirely determined by the lower WMAP bound on the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) spectral index. We find that the SM phenomenology is sensitive to current
cosmological data, which suggests to perform more precise CMB measurements as a
SM test complementary to the LHC program. By using the concept of a
field-dependent cutoff, we show the naturalness of the gradient and curvature
expansion in this model within the conventional perturbation theory range of
the SM. We also discuss the relation of these results to two-loop calculations
and the limitations of the latter caused by parametrization and gauge
dependence problems.
