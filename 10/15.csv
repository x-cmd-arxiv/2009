magnetic fields are much stronger than their surface fields; therefore,
magnetic pressure partially supports the crust against gravity. The crust loses
magnetic pressure support as the field decays and must compensate by increasing
the electron degeneracy pressure; the accompanying increase in the electron
Fermi energy induces nonequilibrium, exothermic electron captures. The total
heat released via field-decay electron captures is comparable to the total
magnetic energy in the crust. Thus, field-decay electron captures are an
important, if not the primary, mechanism powering magnetars' soft X-ray
emission.

  IceCube Detector","PhD dissertation filed at the University of California, Berkeley,
  September 2009",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  IceCube is an all-flavor, cubic kilometer neutrino telescope currently under
construction in the deep glacial ice at the South Pole. Its embedded optical
sensors detect Cherenkov light from charged particles produced in neutrino
interactions in the ice. For several years IceCube has been detecting muon
tracks from charged-current muon neutrino interactions. However, IceCube has
yet to observe the electromagnetic or hadronic particle showers or ""cascades""
initiated by charged-current or neutral-current neutrino interactions. The
first detection of such an event signature is expected to come from the known
flux of atmospheric electron and muon neutrinos.
  A search for atmospheric neutrino-induced cascades was performed using 275.46
days of data from IceCube's 22-string configuration. Reconstruction and
background rejection techniques were developed to reach, for the first time, a
signal-to-background ratio ~1. Above a reconstructed energy of 5 TeV, 12
candidate events were observed in the full dataset. The signal expectation from
the canonical Bartol atmospheric neutrino flux model is 5.63+-2.25 events,
while the expectation from the atmospheric neutrino flux as measured by
IceCube's predecessor array AMANDA is 7.48 +- 1.50 events. Quoted errors
include the uncertainty on the flux only.
  While a conclusive detection can not yet be claimed because of a lack of
background Monte Carlo statistics, the evidence that we are at the level of
background suppression needed to see atmospheric neutrino-induced cascades is
strong. In addition, one extremely interesting candidate event of energy 133
TeV survives all cuts and shows an intriguing double pulse structure in its
waveforms that may signal the ""double bang"" of a tau neutrino interaction.

gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow spectral energy distributions, spanning the
X-ray through to near-infrared wavelengths. This is the largest sample of GRB
afterglow spectral energy distributions thus far studied, providing a strong
handle on the optical depth distribution of soft X-ray absorption and
dust-extinction systems in GRB host galaxies. We detect an absorption system
within the GRB host galaxy in 79% of the sample, and an extinction system in
71% of the sample, and find the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) extinction law to
provide an acceptable fit to the host galaxy extinction profile for the
majority of cases, consistent with previous findings. The range in the soft
X-ray absorption to dust-extinction ratio, N_{H,X}/Av, in GRB host galaxies
spans almost two orders of magnitude, and the typical ratios are significantly
larger than those of the Magellanic Clouds or Milky Way. Although dust
destruction could be a cause, at least in part, for the large N_{H,X}/Av
ratios, the good fit provided by the SMC extinction law for the majority of our
sample suggests that there is an abundance of small dust grains in the GRB
environment, which we would expect to have been destroyed if dust destruction
were responsible for the large N_{H,X}/Av ratios. Instead, our analysis
suggests that the distribution of N_{H,X}/Av in GRB host galaxies may be mostly
intrinsic to these galaxies, and this is further substantiated by evidence for
a strong negative correlation between N_{H,X}/Av and metallicity for a
subsample of GRB hosts with known metallicity. Furthermore, we find the
N_{H,X}/Av ratio and metallicity for this subsample of GRBs to be comparable to
the relation found in other more metal-rich galaxies.

features, and sometimes by either fixing bugs or replacing outdated
implementations with new ones. When software engineers fail to anticipate such
evolution during development, they will eventually be forced to re-architect or
re-build from scratch. Therefore, it has been common practice to prepare for
changes so that software products are extensible over their lifetimes. However,
making software extensible is challenging because it is difficult to anticipate
successive changes and to provide adequate abstraction mechanisms over
potential changes. Such extensibility mechanisms, furthermore, should not
compromise any existing functionality during extension. Software engineers
would benefit from a tool that provides a way to add extensions in a reliable
way. It is natural to expect programming languages to serve this role.
Extensible programming is one effort to address these issues.
  In this thesis, we present type safe extensible programming using the MLPolyR
language. MLPolyR is an ML-like functional language whose type system provides
type-safe extensibility mechanisms at several levels. After presenting the
language, we will show how these extensibility mechanisms can be put to good
use in the context of product line engineering. Product line engineering is an
emerging software engineering paradigm that aims to manage variations, which
originate from successive changes in software.

interpretation of a future U_{e3} measurement. Subsequently we confront our new
values for delta^{ij}_{LL} with a GUT analysis. Further, we include the effects
of dimension-5 Yukawa terms, which are needed to fix the Yukawa unification of
the first two generations. If universal supersymmetry breaking occurs above the
GUT scale, we find the flavour structure of the dimension-5 Yukawa couplings

the assertion that protostellar accretion and outflow activity persists to the
lowest masses. In this paper we present the results of our latest investigation
of brown dwarf (BD) outflow activity and report on the discovery of two new
outflows. Here ISO-Oph 32 is shown to drive a blue-shifted outflow with a
radial velocity of 10-20 km/s and spectro-astrometric analysis constrains the
position angle of this outflow to 240 +/- 7 degrees. The BD candidate ISO-Cha1
217 is found to have a bipolar outflow bright in several key forbidden lines
(radial velocity = -20 km/s, +40 km/s) and with a PA of 190-210 degrees. A
striking feature of the ISO-Cha1 217 outflow is the strong asymmetry between
the red and blue-shifted lobes. This asymmetry is revealed in the relative
brightness of the two lobes (red-shifted lobe is brighter), the factor of two
difference in radial velocity (the red-shifted lobe is faster) and the
difference in the electron density (again higher in the red lobe). Such
asymmetries are common in jets from low mass protostars and the observation of
a marked asymmetry at such a low mass supports the idea that BD outflow
activity is scaled down from low mass protostellar activity.
  In addition to presenting these new results, a comprehensive comparison is
made between BD outflow activity and jets launched by CTTSs. In particular, the
application of current methods for investigating the excitation conditions and
mass loss rates in CTT jets to BD spectra is explored.

ordered systems. One usually assumes that the magnetic order induces a
hyperfine magnetic field, $B_{hyperfine}$, at the ME active site. This is the
case in the ruthenates, where the temperature dependence of $B_{hyperfine}$ at
$^{99}$Ru sites tracks the temperature dependence of the ferromagnetic or
antiferromagnetic order. However this does not happen in the rare-earth
intermetallics, GdRu$_2$ and HoRu$_2$. Specific heat, magnetization, magnetic
susceptibility, M\""{o}ssbauer effect, and neutron diffraction have been used to
study the nature of the magnetic order in these materials. Both materials are
found to order ferromagnetically at 82.3 and 15.3 K, respectively. Despite the
ferromagnetic order of the rare earth moments in both systems, there is no
evidence of a correspondingly large $B_{hyperfine}$ in the M\""{o}ssbauer
spectrum at the Ru site. Instead the measured spectra consist of a narrow peak
at all temperatures which points to the absence of magnetic order. To
understand the surprising absence of a transferred hyperfine magnetic field, we
carried out {\it ab initio} calculations which show that spin polarization is
present only on the rare-earth site. The electron spin at the Ru sites is
effectively unpolarized and, as a result, $B_{hyperfine}$ is very small at
those sites. This occurs because the 4$d$ Ru electrons form broad conduction
bands rather than localized moments. These 4$d$ conduction bands are polarized
in the region of the Fermi energy and mediate the interaction between the
localized rare earth moments.

an unobscured AGN. Photometric observations over several years additionally
show significant variability in the blue emission of four optically dull AGNs.
The nature of the blue and infrared emission suggest that the optically

the AGNs. Instead, up to ~70% of optically dull AGNs are diluted by their
hosts, with bright or simply edge-on hosts lying preferentially within the

4 with no visible optical/IR counterpart. The very deep (~2.7 uJy rms) VLA data

observed IR and X-ray flux. Optically bright, Type 1 and red AGN lie in
distinct regions of the IR vs X-ray flux plots, demonstrating the wide range of
SEDs in this sample and providing the potential for classification/source

robustness of Hall currents limits information accessible from charge
transport. Consequently, the gapless edge excitations are incompletely
understood. The effective edge states theory describes them as prototypal
one-dimensional chiral fermions - a simple picture that explains a large body
of observations and calls for quantum information experiments with quantum
point contacts in the role of beam splitters. However, it is in ostensible
disagreement with the prevailing theoretical framework that predicts, in most
situations, additional gapless edge modes. Here, we present a setup which gives
access to the energy distribution, and consequently to the energy current, in
an edge channel brought out-of-equilibrium. This provides a stringent test of
whether the additional states capture part of the injected energy. Our results
show it is not the case and thereby demonstrate regarding energy transport, the
quantum optics analogy of quantum point contacts and beam splitters. Beyond the

heat transport and out-of-equilibrium experiments.

simultaneous accretion, wind outflow, and coronal X-ray emission. The impact of
plasma on the stellar surface from magnetospheric accretion streams is likely
to be a dominant source of energy and momentum in the upper atmospheres of
these stars. This paper presents a set of models for the dynamics and heating
of three distinct regions on T Tauri stars that are affected by accretion: (1)
the shocked plasmas directly beneath the magnetospheric accretion streams, (2)
stellar winds that are accelerated along open magnetic flux tubes, and (3)
closed magnetic loops that resemble the Sun's coronal active regions. For the
loops, a self-consistent model of coronal heating was derived from numerical
simulations of solar field-line tangling and turbulent dissipation. Individual
models are constructed for the properties of 14 well-observed stars in the
Taurus-Auriga star-forming region. Predictions for the wind mass loss rates
are, on average, slightly lower than the observations, which suggests that disk
winds or X-winds may also contribute to the measured outflows. For some of the
stars, however, the modeled stellar winds do appear to contribute significantly
to the measured mass fluxes. Predictions for X-ray luminosities from the shocks
and loops are in general agreement with existing observations. The stars with
the highest accretion rates tend to have X-ray luminosities dominated by the
high-temperature (5-10 MK) loops. The X-ray luminosities for the stars having
lower accretion rates are dominated by the cooler accretion shocks.

of the prior measure using the Minimum Cross Entropy method. As the latter

computationally efficient. Both the static (one-period) and dynamic versions of
the model are presented. The latter can be used for pricing and risk management

oscillations involving sterile neutrinos and which may be related to the LSND

suggest a difference between neutrinos and antineutrinos with significant
($\sin^22\theta_{\mu \mu} \sim 35%$) $\bar \nu_\mu$ disappearance. In order to
test whether the low-energy excess is due to neutrino oscillations and whether
there is a difference between $\nu_\mu$ and $\bar \nu_\mu$ disappearance, we
propose building a second MiniBooNE detector at (or moving the existing
MiniBooNE detector to) a distance of $\sim 200$ m from the Booster Neutrino
Beam (BNB) production target. With identical detectors at different distances,
most of the systematic errors will cancel when taking a ratio of events in the
two detectors, as the neutrino flux varies as $1/r^2$ to a calculable
approximation. This will allow sensitive tests of oscillations for both $\nu_e$

rays (UHECRs). Using the catalogue of Karachentsev et al. including nearby
galaxies with distances less than 10Mpc (Local Volume), we search for a
correlation with the sample of UHECR events released so far by the Pierre Auger
collaboration. The counterpart sample selection is performed with variable
distance and luminosity cuts which extract the most likely sources in the
catalogue. The probability of chance correlation after penalizing for scans is
0.96%, which corresponds to a correlation signal of 2.6\sigma. We find that the
parameters that maximize the signal are \psi=3.0deg, D_{max}=4Mpc and M_B=-15
for the maximum angular separation between cosmic rays and galaxy sources,
maximum distance to the source, and sources brighter than B-band absolute
magnitude respectively. This implies a preference for the UHECRs arrival
directions to be correlated with the nearest and most luminous galaxies in the
Local Volume. We note that nearby galaxies with D<10Mpc show a similar
correlation with UHECRs as compared to that found by The Pierre Auger
Collaboration using active galactic nuclei (AGNs) within 70-100Mpc instead of
local galaxies, although less than 20% of cosmic ray events are correlated to a
source in our study. However, the observational evidence for mixed composition
in the high-energy end of the cosmic ray spectrum supports the possibility of a
local origin for UHECRs, as CNO nuclei can travel only few Mpc without strong
attenuation by the GZK effect, whereas the observed suppression in the energy
spectrum would require more distant sources in the case of pure proton
composition interacting with the CMB.

lead to the formation of a protoneutron star and a collapse-driven supernova
explosion. This process represents a path alternative to thermonuclear
disruption of accreting white dwarfs in Type Ia supernovae. Neutrino and
gravitational-wave (GW) observations may provide crucial information necessary
to reveal a potential AIC. Motivated by the need for systematic predictions of
the GW signature of AIC, we present results from an extensive set of
general-relativistic AIC simulations using a microphysical finite-temperature
equation of state and an approximate treatment of deleptonization during
collapse. Investigating a set of 114 progenitor models in rotational
equilibrium, with a wide range of rotational configurations, temperatures and
central densities, we extend previous Newtonian studies and find that the GW
signal has a generic shape akin to what is known as a ""Type III"" signal in the
literature. We discuss the detectability of the emitted GWs, showing that the
signal-to-noise ratio for current or next-generation interferometer detectors
could be high enough to detect such events in our Galaxy. Some of our AIC
models form massive quasi-Keplerian accretion disks after bounce. In rapidly
differentially rotating models, the disk mass can be as large as ~0.8-Msun.
Slowly and/or uniformly rotating models produce much smaller disks. Finally, we
find that the postbounce cores of rapidly spinning white dwarfs can reach
sufficiently rapid rotation to develop a nonaxisymmetric rotational
instability.

improved mass map to study z~5-6 Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs), which we detect

model. We quantify the uncertainties in the magnification map reconstruction in
the intrinsic source luminosity, and in the volume surveyed, and show that they
are negligible compared to sample variance when determining the luminosity
function of high-redshift galaxies. With shallower and comparable magnitude
limits to HUDF and GOODS, the Bullet cluster observations, after correcting for
magnification, probe deeper into the luminosity function of the high redshift
galaxies than GOODS and only slightly shallower than HUDF. We conclude that
accurately focused cosmic telescopes are the most efficient way to sample the

second state, though corresponding to the lower free energy value of the pair
of n node BEC states, is always unstable, whereas the first can be dynamically
stable in intervals of the potential well depth, implying that the standing

that confuses the eavesdropping relay and disables it from being able to

consider both armchair and zigzag edges, and for each edge type, we consider
the two edge alignments, namely, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ edge alignment. For the
armchair nanoflakes we identify three distinct classes of bilayer energy gaps,
determined by the number of carbon chains in the width direction ({\it N} =

found to be absent in armchair nanoflakes. Class 3{\it p}+2 armchair nanoflakes
show significant length dependence. We find that the gaps decrease with the
applied electric fields due to large intrinsic gap of the nanoflake. The
existence of a critical gap with respect to the applied field, therefore, is
not predicted by our calculations. Magnetism between the layers plays a major

trilepton signals are the most significant ones for seesaw mediators. As
previously pointed out, this is indeed the case for scalar (type II) and
fermion (type III) triplets at LHC, which can be discovered in this channel for
masses up to 500-700 GeV and an integrated luminosity of 30 fb^-1; whereas
fermion singlets (type I) are marginally observable if there are no further new
physics near the TeV scale. However, if there are new gauge interactions at
this scale coupling to right-handed neutrinos, as in left-right models, heavy
neutrinos are observable up to masses ~ 2 TeV for new gauge boson masses up to
~ 4 TeV, as we discuss in some detail.

Einstein's block universe, in which we travel in thermodynamically emphasized
direction: arrow of time. Arguments for such nonintuitive and nonlocal living
in kind of ""4D jello"" come among others from: Lagrangian mechanics we use from
QFT to GR saying that history between fixed past and future situation is the

in equilibrium between past and future - minimizing tension as action of

of particles; there is no limit on the number of particles at a given site.
Isolated active particles fall asleep at rate $\lambda > 0$, and then remain
asleep until joined by another particle at the same site. The state in which
all particles are inactive is absorbing. Whether activity continues at long
times depends on the relation between the particle density $\zeta$ and the
sleeping rate $\lambda$. We discuss the general case, and then, for the
one-dimensional totally asymmetric case, study the phase transition between an
active phase (for sufficiently large particle densities and/or small $\lambda$)
and an absorbing one. We also present arguments regarding the asymptotic mean
hopping velocity in the active phase, the rate of fixation in the absorbing
phase, and survival of the infinite system at criticality. Using mean-field
theory and Monte Carlo simulation, we locate the phase boundary. The phase
transition appears to be continuous in both the symmetric and asymmetric
versions of the process, but the critical behavior is very different. The
former case is characterized by simple integer or rational values for critical
exponents ($\beta = 1$, for example), and the phase diagram is in accord with
the prediction of mean-field theory. We present evidence that the symmetric

is observed to increase significantly with cosmic time, from redshift z>2 to
the present. A popular explanation for this size evolution is that ETGs grow
through dissipationless (""dry"") mergers, thus becoming less compact. Combining
N-body simulations with up-to-date scaling relations of local ETGs, we show
that such an explanation is problematic, because dry mergers do not decrease
the galaxy stellar-mass surface-density enough to explain the observed size
evolution, and also introduce substantial scatter in the scaling relations.
Based on our set of simulations, we estimate that major and minor dry mergers
increase half-light radius and projected velocity dispersion with stellar mass
(M) as M^(1.09+/-0.29) and M^(0.07+/-0.11), respectively. This implies that: 1)
if the high-z ETGs are indeed as dense as estimated, they cannot evolve into
present-day ETGs via dry mergers; 2) present-day ETGs cannot have assembled
more than ~45% of their stellar mass via dry mergers. Alternatively, dry
mergers could be reconciled with the observations if there was extreme fine
tuning between merger history and galaxy properties, at variance with our
assumptions. Full cosmological simulations will be needed to evaluate whether
this fine-tuned solution is acceptable.

from large, cold dust grains, which constitute the main part of the total dust

Schrodinger operator with a periodic potential in dimensions higher than 1 has
only finitely many gaps. After work done by many authors, it has been proven by
now in full generality. The similar conjecture in presence of a periodic
magnetic potential has been proven in dimension 2 only. Another case of a
significant interest, due to its importance for the photonic crystal theory, is
of a periodic Maxwell operator, where apparently no results of such kind are
known. We establish here that in the case of a 2D photonic crystal, i.e. of the
medium periodic in two variables and homogeneous in the third one, if the
dielectric function is separable, the number of spectral gaps of the
corresponding Maxwell operator is indeed finite. It is also shown that, as one
would expect, when the medium is near to being homogeneous, there are no
spectral gaps at all.

when (i) the communication among the sensors is noisy; (ii) the communication
links in the network may fail with a non-zero probability; and (iii) the
measurements performed to compute distances among the sensors are corrupted
with noise. The sensors (which do not know their locations) lie in the convex
hull of at least $m+1$ anchors (nodes that know their own locations.) Under
minimal assumptions on the connectivity and triangulation of each sensor in the

$0.997\cdots$, which is very close to 1, the expected value with the black hole
entropy given as $A/4$. We conjecture that the difference, 0.003, is due to the
extra dimensions that may modify the area spectrum. Then, we derive a formula
for the degeneracy for a single-partition black hole, i.e., a black hole made
of a single unit area, and explicitly show that our area spectrum correctly
reproduces the degeneracy. Furthermore, by using two totally different methods,
we obtain the proportionality constant ""$C$"" related to the degeneracy. The
first method based on fitting yields 172$\sim$173 while the second method
yields 172.87$\cdots$, which strongly suggest that our area spectrum is on the

magnetic fields, the Coulomb interactions between them become dominant and can
lead to novel states of matter such as fractional quantum Hall liquids. In
these liquids electrons linked to magnetic flux quanta form complex composite
quasipartices, which are manifested in the quantization of the Hall
conductivity as rational fractions of the conductance quantum. The recent
experimental discovery of an anomalous integer quantum Hall effect in graphene
has opened up a new avenue in the study of correlated 2D electronic systems, in
which the interacting electron wavefunctions are those of massless chiral
fermions. However, due to the prevailing disorder, graphene has thus far
exhibited only weak signatures of correlated electron phenomena, despite
concerted experimental efforts and intense theoretical interest. Here, we
report the observation of the fractional quantum Hall effect in ultraclean
suspended graphene, supporting the existence of strongly correlated electron
states in the presence of a magnetic field. In addition, at low carrier density
graphene becomes an insulator with an energy gap tunable by magnetic field.
These newly discovered quantum states offer the opportunity to study a new
state of matter of strongly correlated Dirac fermions in the presence of large
magnetic fields.

study oscillations systematically in large numbers of solar-like stars. In the
framework of the asteroFLAG project, we have developed an automated pipeline to
estimate global oscillation parameters, such as the frequency of maximum power
(nu_max) and the large frequency spacing (Delta_nu), for a large number of time
series. We present an effective method based on the autocorrelation function to
find excess power and use a scaling relation to estimate granulation timescales
as initial conditions for background modelling. We derive reliable
uncertainties for nu_max and Delta_nu through extensive simulations. We have
tested the pipeline on about 2000 simulated Kepler stars with magnitudes of
V~7-12 and were able to correctly determine nu_max and Delta_nu for about half
of the sample. For about 20%, the returned large frequency spacing is accurate
enough to determine stellar radii to a 1% precision. We conclude that the
methods presented here are a promising approach to process the large amount of
data expected from Kepler.

discuss the following old
  PROBLEM (A. Kelmans, 1984). Is the following claim true?
  (C) If G is a cubic 3-connected graph, then G has an L-packing that avoids at
most two vertices of G.
  We show, in particular, that claim (C) is equivalent to some seemingly
stronger claims (see Theorem 3.1 below).
  For example, if G is a cubic 3-connected graph and the number of vertices of
G is divisible by three, then then the following claims are equivalent: G has
an L-factor, for every edge e of G there is an L-factor of G avoiding
(containing) e, G - {e,f} has an L-factor for every two edges e and f of G, and
G - P has an L-factor for every 3-vertex path P in G.
  It follows that if claim (C) is true, then Reed's dominating graph conjecture
is true for cubic 3-connected graphs.
  We also show that certain claims in Theorem 3.1 are best possible. We give a
construction providing infinitely many cyclically 6-connected graphs G with two
disjoint 3-vertex paths P and P' such that the number of vertices of G is

the genus is one, our examples are embedded outside a compact set. Moreover, we
deform such examples to CMC-1 faces (mean curvature one surfaces with

  Cone-like singular points on maximal surfaces are very important, although
they are not stable under perturbations of maximal surfaces. It is interesting
to ask if cone-like singular points can appear on a maximal surface having
other kinds of singularities. Until now, no such examples were known. We also

seismic fields from stationary local sources. It is found that gravity

excitations and their interactions. The dispersion of the electronic states
revealed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) provides a chance
to understand these excitations. Recently, a ""high energy anomaly"" or
""waterfall-like"" feature in cuprates' dispersion has been reported and studied
theoretically. Most of the current views argue that it is the result of some
many-body effect at a specific high energy scale (e.g. ~ 0.3eV), though there
are other arguments that this is an artificial effect. Here, we report a
systematic ARPES study on the ""high energy anomaly"" in Bi2212 samples over
multiple Brillouin zones and with a large variety of ARPES matrix elements. We
find that the incoherent weight of the electron spectral function at high
binding energy is intimately linked to the energy of the dispersive coherent
weight through an unexpected but simple relationship with no special energy
scales. This behavior in concert with strong k-dependent matrix element effects
gives rise to the heavily studied ""waterfall"" behavior.

the nucleon known as the Roper resonance. Using eigenvectors of the correlation
matrix we construct parity and eigenstate projected correlation functions which
are analysed using standardized methods. The robust nature of this approach for
extracting the eigenstate energies is presented. We report the importance of
using a variety of source and sink smearings in achieving this. Ultimately the
independence of the eigenstate energies from the interpolator basis is
demonstrated. In particular we consider $4\times 4$ correlation matrices built
from a variety of interpolators and smearing levels. Using FLIC fermions to
access the light quark mass regime, we explore the curvature encountered in the
energy of the states as the chiral limit is approached. We report a low-lying
Roper state contrasting earlier results using correlation matrices. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first time a low-lying Roper resonance has been
found using correlation matrix methods. Finally, we present our results in the

the upper limits of an age for the stellar population. Given this constraint,
the minimum {chi}^2 method is used to fit the stellar population models to the

population has an age 40 - 200 Myr with a metallicity 2.5 Z_{sun}. The
starlight is reddened by E(B-V) = 0.8. The reddening is caused by the
foreground dust screen, indicating that dust is depleted in the starburst site
and the starburst site is surrounded by a dust shell. The infrared (8-1000um)
luminosity is L_{ir} = 1.78 +/- 0.63 * 10^{12} L_{sun}. This is two times
greater than that expected from the observed starlight, suggesting either that
1/2 of the starburst site is completely obscured at UV-optical wavelengths, or
that 1/2 of L_{ir} comes from AGN emission. The inferred dust mass is 2.0 +/-
1.0 * 10^8 M_{sun}. This is sufficient to form a shell surrounding the galaxy
with an optical depth E(B-V) = 0.8. From our best stellar population model - an
instantaneous starburst with an age 40 Myr, we infer the rate of 19
supernovae(SNe) per year. Simply analytical models imply that 2.5 Z_{sun} in

metallcity is 4.8 Z_{sun} at this point. The gas-to-dust mass ratio is then 120

various physical effects that can potentially influence the observed wave

regions (where the photon ray is nearly parallel to the magnetic field) and
mode circularization due to the difference in the electron/positron

for wave polarization in the rotating magnetosphere, taking account of all the
propagation effects in a self-consistent manner. For typical magnetospheric
plasma parameters produced by pair cascade, we find that the observed radio
intensity and polarization profiles can be strongly modified by the propagation
effects. For relatively large impact parameter (the minimum angle between the
magnetic dipole axis and the line of sight), the polarization angle profile is
similar to the prediction from the Rotating Vector Model, except for a phase
shift and an appreciable circular polarization. For smaller impact parameter,
the linear polarization position angle may exhibit a sudden $90^o$ jump due to
the quasi-tangential propagation effect, accompanied by complex circular
polarization profile. Some applications of our results are discussed, including
the origin of non-gaussion pulse profiles, the relationship between the

Motivated by the inability of static models to explain this, we then modelled
the evolution of the size--density relation of HII regions by considering their
star formation history, the effects of dust, and pressure-driven expansion. The
results are compared with our sample data whose size and density span roughly
six orders of magnitude. We find that the extragalactic size--density relation
does not result from an evolutionary sequence of HII regions but rather
reflects a sequence with different initial gas densities (``density
hierarchy''). Moreover, the size of many HII regions is limited by dust
absorption of ionizing photons, rather than consumption by ionizing neutral
hydrogen. Dust extinction of ionizing photons is particularly severe over the
entire lifetime of compact HII regions with typical gas densities of greater
than 10^3 cm^{-3}. Hence, as long as the number of ionizing photons is used to
trace massive star formation, much star-formation activity could be missed.
Such compact dense environments, the ones most profoundly obscured by dust,
have properties similar to ``maximum--intensity starbursts''. This implies that
submillimeter and infrared wavelengths may be necessary to accurately assess
star formation in these extreme conditions both locally and at high redshift.

is reduced by increasing the strength of quantum gravitational corrections.

attractions induced by the presence of short polymer chains (radius of gyration
rg = 3nm, starting volume fraction 0.0224). After crystallization, stacking
faulted face centred cubic crystals coexist with about 5% of melt remaining in
the grain boundaries. From the Bragg scattering signal we infer the amount of
crystalline material, the average crystallite size and the number density of
crystals as a function of time. This allows to discriminate an early stage of
conversion, followed by an extended coarsening stage. The small angle
scattering (SALS) appears only long after completed conversion and exhibits
Furukawa scaling for all times. Additional microscopic experiments reveal that
the grain boundaries have a reduced Bragg scattering power but possess an
increased refractive index. Fits of the Furukawa function indicate that the
dimensionality of the scatterers decreases from 2.25 at short times to 1.65 at
late times and the characteristic length scale is slightly larger than the
average crystallite size. Together this suggests the SALS signal is due
scattering from a foam like grain boundary network as a whole.

description of the early Universe cosmology induced by quantum and thermal
effects in superstring theories. The present evolution of the Universe is
described very accurately by the standard Lambda-CDM scenario, while very
little is known about the early cosmological eras. String theory provides a
consistent microscopic theory to account for such missing epochs. In our
framework, the Universe is a torus filled with a gas of superstrings. We first
show how to describe the thermodynamical properties of this system, namely
energy density and pressure, by introducing temperature and supersymmetry
breaking effects at a fundamental level by appropriate boundary conditions.
  We focus on the intermediate period of the history: After the very early
""Hagedorn era"" and before the late electroweak phase transition. We determine
the back-reaction of the gas of strings on the initially static space-time,
which then yields the induced cosmology. The consistency of our approach is
guaranteed by checking the quasi-staticness of the evolution. It turns out that
for arbitrary initial boundary conditions at the exit of the Hagedorn era, the
quasi-static evolutions are universally attracted to radiation-dominated
solutions. It is shown that at these attractor points, the temperature, the
inverse scale factor of the Universe and the supersymmetry breaking scale
evolve proportionally. There are two important effects which result from the
underlying string description. First, initially small internal dimensions can
be spontaneously decompactified during the attraction to a radiation dominated
Universe. Second, the radii of internal dimensions can be stabilized.

Submillimetre Survey (LESS) covers the full 30' x 30' field size of the ECDFS
and has a uniform noise level of 1.2 mJy/beam. LESS is thus the largest
contiguous deep submillimetre survey undertaken to date. The noise properties
of our map show clear evidence that we are beginning to be affected by
confusion noise. We present a catalog of 126 SMGs detected with a significance
level above 3.7 sigma. The ECDFS exhibits a deficit of bright SMGs relative to
previously studied blank fields but not of normal star-forming galaxies that
dominate the extragalactic background light (EBL). This is in line with the
underdensities observed for optically defined high redshift source populations
in the ECDFS (BzKs, DRGs,optically bright AGN and massive K-band selected
galaxies). The differential source counts in the full field are well described
by a power law with a slope of alpha=-3.2, comparable to the results from other
fields. We show that the shape of the source counts is not uniform across the
field. The integrated 870 micron flux densities of our source-count models
account for >65% of the estimated EBL from COBE measurements. We have
investigated the clustering of SMGs in the ECDFS by means of a two-point
correlation function and find evidence for strong clustering on angular scales
<1'. Assuming a power law dependence for the correlation function and a typical
redshift distribution for the SMGs we derive a spatial correlation length of
r_0=13+/-6 h^-1 Mpc.

concentrations $p$=8.2$\times10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $p$=2$\times10^{11}$

in the magnetic fields of up to 18 T, parallel or tilted with respect to the
two-dimensional (2D) channel plane. The large in-plane magnetoresistance can be
explained by the influence of the \textit{in-plane} magnetic field on the
orbital motion of the charge carriers in the quasi-2D system. The measurements
of $\rho_{xx}$ and $\rho_{xy}$ in the tilted magnetic field showed that the
anomaly in $\rho_{xx}$, observed at filling factor $\nu$=3/2 is practically
nonexistent in the conductivity $\sigma_{xx}$. The anomaly in $\sigma_{xx}$ at
$\nu$=2 might be explained by overlapping of the levels with different spins
0$\uparrow$ and 1$\downarrow$ when the tilt angle of the applied magnetic field
is changed. The dependence of g-factor $g^*(\Theta)/g^*(0^0)$ on the tilt angle
$\Theta$ was determined.

results of cross section calculations for both this channel and for

charged current quasielastic scattering (CCQE) and $1 \pi$ production are
closely entangled in actual experiments, due to final state interactions of the
scattered nucleons on one hand and of the $\Delta$ resonances and pions, on the
other hand. We discuss the uncertainties in the elementary pion production
cross sections from ANL and BNL. We find the surprising result that the recent
$1 \pi$ production cross section data from MiniBooNE are well described by
calculations without any FSI. For higher energies we study the validity of the
Bloom-Gilman quark-hadron duality for both electron- and neutrino-induced
reactions. While this duality holds quite well for nucleon targets, for nuclear
targets the average resonance contributions to the structure function $F_2$ are
always lower than the DIS values. This result indicates a significant impact of
nuclear effects on observables, reducing the cross section and structure
functions by at least 30-40% and changing the form of various distributions.

approach presented here is a first principle's approach which aims at deriving
the main glass properties from the microscopic Hamiltonian. In contrast to the
old use of replicas in the theory of disordered systems, this replica approach
applies also to systems without quenched disorder (in this sense, replicas have
nothing to do with computing the average of a logarithm of the partition
function). It has the advantage of describing in an unified setting both the
behaviour near the dynamic transition (mode coupling transition) and the
behaviour near the equilibrium `transition' (Kauzmann transition) that is
present in fragile glasses. The replica method may be used to solve simple mean
field models, providing explicit examples of systems that may be studied
analytically in great details and behave similarly to the experiments. Finally,
using the replica formalism and some well adapted approximation schemes, it is
possible to do explicit analytic computations of the properties of realistic
models of glasses. The results of these first-principle computations are in
reasonable agreement with numerical simulations. Draft of a chapter prepared

000 processes for a Cartesian computational domain of ~1000^3 cells. The
simplicity of FISH has been achieved by the rigorous application of the
operator splitting technique, while second order accuracy is maintained by the
symmetric ordering of the operators. Between directional sweeps, the
three-dimensional data is rotated in memory so that the sweep is always
performed in a cache-efficient way along the direction of contiguous memory.
Hence, the code only requires a one-dimensional description of the conservation
equations to be solved. This approach also enable an elegant novel
parallelisation of the code that is based on persistent communications with MPI
for cubic domain decomposition on machines with distributed memory. This scheme
is then combined with an additional OpenMP parallelisation of different sweeps
that can take advantage of clusters of shared memory. We document the detailed
implementation of a second order TVD advection scheme based on flux
reconstruction. The magnetic fields are evolved by a constrained transport
scheme. We show that the subtraction of a simple estimate of the hydrostatic
gradient from the total gradients can significantly reduce the dissipation of
the advection scheme in simulations of gravitationally bound hydrostatic
objects. Through its simplicity and efficiency, FISH is as well-suited for
hydrodynamics classes as for large-scale astrophysical simulations on
high-performance computer clusters. In preparation for the release of a public

blows up at \Sigma. Here we show that in addition, large classes of spherically
symmetric initial data have solutions to the Jang equation which blow up at

even inside of strictly outer trapped surfaces. Unlike for outermost MOTSs,

inner MOTSs, even in spherical symmetry. Secondly, an unpublished result of R.
Schoen, whose proof we include here, says that in the time-symmetric case, any

velocity dispersions, virial masses, and CO luminosity masses. We found that
the virial parameter alpha, which is defined as the ratio of the virial mass to
the CO luminosity mass, is almost unity for GMAs in spiral arms, whereas there
exist some GMAs whose alpha are 3 -- 10 in the inter-arm region. We found that
GMAs with higher $\alpha$ tend not to be associated with massive star forming
regions, while other virialized GMAs are. Since alpha mainly depends on
velocity dispersion of the GMA, we suppose the onset of star formation in these

small but diverse set of X-ray binaries observed with the Chandra High Energy

able to identify a limited subset of member galaxies, the 'fair galaxies',

particular region of the galaxy distribution in the redshift (line-of-sight
velocity versus sky-plane distance from the cluster centre). This 'fair region'
is unambiguously defined through statistical and geometrical assumptions based
on the SCM. These results are used to develop a new technique for estimating
the mass profiles of observed clusters and subsequently their masses. We tested
our technique on a sample of simulated clusters; the mass profiles estimates
are proved to be efficient from 1 up to 7 virialization radii, within a typical

corona. Damped oscillations and propagating waves are commonly observed. These
oscillations have been interpreted in terms of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves.
Ion-neutral collisions and non-adiabatic effects (radiation losses and thermal
conduction) have been proposed as damping mechanisms. We study the effect of
the presence of helium on the time damping of non-adiabatic MHD waves in a
plasma composed by electrons, protons, neutral hydrogen, neutral helium (He I),
and singly ionized helium (He II) in the single-fluid approximation. The
dispersion relation of linear non-adiabatic MHD waves in a homogeneous,
unbounded, and partially ionized prominence medium is derived. The period and
the damping time of Alfven, slow, fast, and thermal waves are computed. A
parametric study of the ratio of the damping time to the period with respect to
the helium abundance is performed. The efficiency of ion-neutral collisions as
well as thermal conduction is increased by the presence of helium. However, if
realistic abundances of helium in prominences (~10%) are considered, this
effect has a minor influence on the wave damping. The presence of helium can be
safely neglected in studies of MHD waves in partially ionized prominence
plasmas.

listed in the Tycho catalog, such as distance to Earth, m_V, and (B-V), and
those parameters needed to account for the probability of a star to host an
observable, transiting exoplanet. The empirical relations between stellar
metallicity and planet occurrence combined with geometrical considerations were
used to yield transit probabilities for the MS stars in the Tycho catalog.
Magnitude variations in the FOV were simulated to test whether this
fluctuations would be detected by BEST, XO, SuperWASP and HATNet. We present a
sky map of the expected number of Hot Jupiter transit events on the basis of

significantly differing maps of the expected transit detections. The
sky-integrated magnitude distribution predicts 20 Hot Jupiter transits with

nature of the different kinds of power dissipated in metallic ferromagnets
contacted to an electric generator, and to exploit it in the framework of the
theory of mesoscopic non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The expression of the
internal power (i.e. the internal entropy production multiplied by the
temperature) dissipated by a generic system connected to different reservoirs,
allows the corresponding kinetic equations to be derived with the introduction
of the relevant phenomenological kinetic coefficients. After derivation of the
kinetic equations for the ferromagnetic degrees of freedom (i.e. the
Landau-Lifshitz equation) and the derivation of the kinetic equations for the
spin-accumulation effects (within a two channel model), the kinetic equations
describing spin-transfer are obtained. Both spin-dependent relaxation (usual
spin-accumulation) and spin-precession in quasi-ballistic regime (transverse
spin-accumulation) are taken into account. The generalization of the
Landau-Lifshitz equation to spin-accumulation is then performed with the
introduction of two potential energy terms, that are experimentally accessible.

the charge neutrality point. Two origins for the fluctuations were identified
close to the CNP. At very low magnetic fields there exist only mesoscopic
magneto-conductance quantum interference features which develop rapidly as a
function of density. At slightly higher fields (> 0.5T), close to the CNP,
additional fluctuations track the quantum Hall sequence expected for monolayer
graphene. These additional features are attributed to effects of locally
charging individual quantum Hall (QH) localized states. These effects reveal a
precursor to the quantum Hall effect (QHE) since, unlike previous transport
observations of QH dots charging effects, they occur in the absence of quantum
Hall plateaus or Shubnikov- de Haas (SdH) oscillations. From our transport data
we are able to extract parameters that characterize the inhomogeneities in our
device.

  paper, and some previously misprinted formulas have been fixed. A slightly
  different version of this manuscript has been submitted to BMC Bioinformatics",,,,"q-bio.BM q-bio.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Natively unfolded proteins lack a well defined three dimensional structure
but have important biological functions, suggesting a re-assignment of the
structure-function paradigm. Many proteins have amino acidic compositions
compatible both with the folded and unfolded status, and belong to a twilight
zone between order and disorder. This makes difficult a dichotomic
classification of protein sequences into folded and natively unfolded ones. In
this methodological paper dichotomic folding indexes are considered:
hydrophobicity-charge, mean packing, mean pairwise energy, Poodle-W and a new
global index, that is called here gVSL2, based on the local disorder predictor
VSL2. The performance of these indexes is evaluated on different datasets.
Poodle-W, gVSL2 and mean pairwise energy have good performance and stability in
all the datasets considered and are combined into a strictly unanimous
combination score SSU, that leaves proteins unclassified when the consensus of
all combined indexes is not reached. The unclassified proteins: i) belong to an
overlap region in the vector space of amino acidic compositions occupied by
both folded and unfolded proteins; ii) are composed by approximately the same
number of order-promoting and disorder-promoting amino acids; iii) have a mean
flexibility intermediate between that of folded and that of unfolded proteins.
These proteins reasonably have physical properties intermediate between those
of folded and those of natively unfolded proteins and their structural
properties and evolutionary history are worth to be investigated.

scaling with a spectral slope of -5/3 in wavenumber space. The energy transfer
process in the magnetized solar wind, characterized typically by MHD
turbulence, over extended length-scales remains an unresolved paradox of modern
turbulence theories, raising the question of how a compressible magnetofluid
exhibits a turbulent spectrum that is characteristic of an incompressible
hydrodynamic fluid. To address these questions, we have undertaken
three-dimensional time dependent numerical simulations of a compressible
magnetohydrodynamic fluid describing super-Alfv\'enic, supersonic and strongly
magnetized plasma fluid. It is shown that a Kolmogorov-like density spectrum
can develop by plasma motions that are dominated by Alfv\'enic cascades whereas
compressive modes are dissipated.

  II: Phenomenology of Relaxation Dynamics","RevTex 4.0 style, 10 pages + 7 eps figures",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  After a general overview of some features of the relaxation dynamics of the
Hamiltonian Mean Field model, its equilibrium thermodynamic properties are used
to rephrase the out-of-equilibrium regime for energies below the critical point
$u_{c}=0.75$ in terms of an effective dynamical coexistence between a clustered
and a gaseous phases, whose existence could be associated to the large
relaxation times observed when $u_{1}<u<u_{c}$, with $u_{1}=0.5$. Starting from
the hypothesis that the \textit{parametric resonance} is the microscopic
mechanism allowing the energetic interchange between the particles during the
collisional regime, a phenomenological Fokker-Planck equation based on a
Langevin equation with a multiplicative noise is proposed in order to describe
the collisional relaxation of this system towards its final equilibrium, which
supports the following dependence of the collisional relaxation timescale
$\tau_{cr}=\tau_{0}N\equiv\sqrt{IN/g}$.

of supersymmetric gauge theories is critically analysed thereby exhibiting its
ingredients and approximations involved. We reveal its limitations and identify
its range of applicability in non-supersymmetric gauge theories. In particular,
we show that this equation is applicable only to strongly asymmetric planar
Wilson loops (consisting of a long and a short pair of loop segments) and as a
consequence the Wilsonian potential can be extracted only up to intermediate
distances. By this equation the Wilson loop is exclusively determined by the
gluon propagator. We solve the Dyson equation in Coulomb gauge for the temporal
Wilson loop with the instantaneous part of the gluon propagator and for the
spatial Wilson loop with the static gluon propagator obtained in the
Hamiltonian approach to continuum Yang-Mills theory and on the lattice. In both
cases we find a linearly rising color potential.
