additional flavor symmetries, U(1)_F's, with flavon scalars F_i, as well as
vectorlike quarks and leptons at the TeV scale. The flavon scalars have VEV in

very few measurements. In the standard Compressed Sensing paradigm, the
$\m\times \n$ measurement matrix $\A$ is required to act as a near isometry on
the set of all $k$-sparse signals (Restricted Isometry Property or RIP).
Although it is known that certain probabilistic processes generate $\m \times
\n$ matrices that satisfy RIP with high probability, there is no practical
algorithm for verifying whether a given sensing matrix $\A$ has this property,
crucial for the feasibility of the standard recovery algorithms. In contrast
this paper provides simple criteria that guarantee that a deterministic sensing
matrix satisfying these criteria acts as a near isometry on an overwhelming
majority of $k$-sparse signals; in particular, most such signals have a unique
representation in the measurement domain. Probability still plays a critical
role, but it enters the signal model rather than the construction of the
sensing matrix. We require the columns of the sensing matrix to form a group
under pointwise multiplication. The construction allows recovery methods for
which the expected performance is sub-linear in $\n$, and only quadratic in
$\m$; the focus on expected performance is more typical of mainstream signal
processing than the worst-case analysis that prevails in standard Compressed
Sensing. Our framework encompasses many families of deterministic sensing
matrices, including those formed from discrete chirps, Delsarte-Goethals codes,
and extended BCH codes.

opportunistic spectrum access: a system consists of n channels (Gilbert-Elliot
channels)where the state (good or bad) of each channel evolves as independent
and identically distributed Markov processes. A user can select exactly k
channels to sense and access (based on the sensing result) in each time slot. A
reward is obtained whenever the user senses and accesses a good channel. The
objective is to design a channel selection policy that maximizes the expected
discounted total reward accrued over a finite or infinite horizon. In our
previous work we established the optimality of a greedy policy for the special
case of k = 1 (i.e., single channel access) under the condition that the
channel state transitions are positively correlated over time. In this paper we
show under the same condition the greedy policy is optimal for the general case
of k >= 1; the methodology introduced here is thus more general. This problem
may be viewed as a special case of the restless bandit problem, with multiple

microstructure is reported. Instead of a correlation function, a pair of
entropic descriptors (EDs) is proposed for stochastic optimization method. The
first of them measures a spatial inhomogeneity, for a binary pattern, or
compositional one, for a greyscale image. The second one quantifies a spatial
or compositional statistical complexity. The EDs reveal structural information
that is dissimilar, at least in part, to that given by correlation functions at
almost all of discrete length scales. The method is tested on a few digitized
binary and greyscale images. In each of the cases, the persuasive
reconstruction of the microstructure is found.

ambipolar, i.e., when the broken symmetry supports the coexistence of both
electron- and hole-like quasiparticles in the excitation spectrum, and the
electron pocket dominates at the low temperatures. In contrast, the Nernst
coefficient is negative and there is no such positive peak if the underlying
state is non-ambipolar, i.e., when it supports only one type of quasiparticles.
More generally, in the ambipolar state, the sign of the Nernst coefficient can
be positive or negative depending on the dominance of the electron or hole
pockets, respectively, in the low temperature thermoelectric transport. By
modeling the pseudogap phase by a doping-dependent DDW order parameter with a
Fermi surface topology that supports both hole and electron pockets, and
assuming energy-independent transport scattering times, we analyze the

coarse-grained formulation is based on the wavevector-dependent correlation
functions of molecular dipoles of the host polar liquid and a density-density
structure factor of the positions of the solutes. A nonlinear dependence of the
absorption coefficient on the solute concentration is predicted and originates
from the mutual polarization of the liquid surrounding the solutes by the
collective field of the solute dipoles aligned along the radiation field. The
theory is applied to terahertz absorption of hydrated saccharides and proteins.
While the theory gives an excellent account of the observations for saccharides
without additional assumptions and fitting parameters, experimental absorption
coefficient of protein solutions significantly exceeds theoretical calculations
within standard dielectric models and shows a peak against the protein
concentration. A substantial polarization of protein's hydration shell is
required to explain the differences between standard theories and experiment.
When the correlation function of the total dipole moment of the protein with
its hydration shell from numerical simulations is used in the present
analytical model an absorption peak similar to that seen is experiment is
obtained. The result is sensitive to the specifics of protein-protein
interactions in solution. Numerical testing of the theory requires the
combination of terahertz dielectric and small-angle scattering measurements.

integrated within the existing infrastructure) on a pay per use basis. These
resources can be released when they are no more needed. Such services are often
offered within the context of a Service Level Agreement (SLA), which ensure the
desired Quality of Service (QoS). Aneka, an enterprise Cloud computing
solution, harnesses the power of compute resources by relying on private and
public Clouds and delivers to users the desired QoS. Its flexible and service
based infrastructure supports multiple programming paradigms that make Aneka
address a variety of different scenarios: from finance applications to
computational science. As examples of scientific computing in the Cloud, we
present a preliminary case study on using Aneka for the classification of gene
expression data and the execution of fMRI brain imaging workflow.

determine if f is constant (i.e. f(x) = const forall x in {0,1}^n) or if f is
balanced (i.e. f(x) = 0 for exactly half the possible input strings x in

assuming f is guaranteed to be constant or balanced. Classically it appears
that this requires at least 2^{n-1}+1 black-box calls in the worst case, but
the well known quantum solution solves the problem with probability one in
exactly one black-box call. It has been found that in some cases the algorithm
can be de-quantised into an equivalent classical, deterministic solution. We
explore the ability to extend this de-quantisation to further cases, and
examine with more detail when de-quantisation is possible, both with respect to

links in a wireless network. Without deliberate coordination and cooperation
among the active links, there is a naturally occurring misalignment between the
symbols of the targeted signal of a receiver and the symbols of the interfering
signals. Interestingly, we show that the interference asynchrony can actually
improve the BER performance, compared with the situation in which symbols of al
signals ay aligned. In particular, we show that symbol misalignment can
decrease the ""effective interference power"" and change the distribution of the
interfering signals, in a way that results in lower BER. To ensure that symbol
misalignment can be consistently attained, we propose two simple schemes that
introduce time-varying symbol offsets to obtain an ""average"" performance of
random symbol misalignment. Notably, our schemes do not change the simple
receiver design structure; only the transmitters are modified in a minor way.

via Hopf quiver approaches. We give a combinatorial description of the Hopf
quivers whose path coalgebras give rise to coquasitriangular Hopf algebras.
With a help of the quiver setting, we study general coquasitriangular pointed
Hopf algebras and obtain a complete classification of the finite-dimensional
ones over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0.

Kazakov","Premixed Flame Propagation in Curved Channels","22 pages, 4 figures",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A theory of flame propagation in curved channels is developed within the
framework of the on-shell description of premixed flames. Employing the Green
function appropriate to the given channel geometry, an implicit integral
representation for the burnt gas velocity is constructed. It is then used to
derive an explicit expression for rotational component of the gas velocity near
the flame front by successive separation of irrotational contributions. We
prove that this separation can be performed in a way consistent with boundary
conditions at the channel walls. As a result, the unknown irrotational
component can be projected out by applying a dispersion relation, thus leading
to a closed system of equations for the on-shell fresh gas velocity and the
flame front position. These equations show that in addition to the usual
nonlocality associated with potential flows, vorticity produced by a curved
flame leads to specific nonlocal spatial and temporal influence of the channel
geometry on the flame evolution. To elucidate this influence, three special
cases are considered in more detail -- steady flame stabilized by incoming flow
in a bottle-shaped channel, quasi-steady flame, and unsteady flame with small
gas expansion propagating in a channel with slowly varying width. In the latter
case, analytical solutions of the derived equations are obtained in the first
post-Sivashinsky approximation using the method of pole decomposition.
