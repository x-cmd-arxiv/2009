a study of the impact of nonlinear evolution of gravitational potentials in the
LCDM model on the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) contribution to the cross-power
spectrum of the CMB and a set of biased tracers of the mass. We use a large
ensemble of N-body simulations to directly follow the potentials and compare
the results to analytic perturbation theory (PT) methods. The PT predictions
match our results to high precision for k<0.2 Mpc/h. We analyze the CMB-density
tracer cross-spectrum using simulations and renormalized bias PT, and find good
agreement. The usual assumption is that nonlinear evolution enhances the growth
of structure and counteracts the linear ISW on small scales, leading to a
change in sign of the CMB-LSS cross-spectrum at small scales. However, PT
analysis suggests that this trend reverses at late times when the logarithmic
growth rate f=d ln D/d ln a<1/2 or Omega_m (z)<0.3. Numerical results confirm
these expectations and we find nonlinear enhancement of the ISW signal on small
scales at late-times. On computing the total contribution to the angular
spectrum, we find that nonlinearity and scale dependence of the bias are unable
to influence the signal-to-noise of the current and future measurements.

circuit signals due to the low copy number of transcription factors. When a
gene circuit component is connected to an existing circuit, the dynamic
properties of the existing circuit can be affected by the connected component.
In this paper, we investigate modularity in the dynamics of the gene circuit
based on stochastic fluctuations in the circuit signals. We show that the noise
in the output signal of the existing circuit can be affected significantly when
the output is connected to the input of another circuit component. More
specifically, the output signal noise can show significantly longer
correlations when the two components are connected. This equivalently means
that the noise power spectral density becomes narrower. We define the relative
change in the correlation time or the spectrum bandwidth by stochastic
retroactivity, which is shown to be directly related to the retroactivity
defined in the deterministic framework by del Vecchio et al. This provides an
insight on how to measure retroactivity, by investigating stochastic
fluctuations in gene expression levels, more specifically, by obtaining an
autocorrelation function of the fluctuations. We also provide an interesting
aspect of the frequency response of the circuit. We show that depending on the
magnitude of operating frequencies, different kinds of signals need to be
preferably chosen for circuit description in a modular fashion: at low enough
frequency, expression level of transcription factor that are not bound to their
specific promoter region needs to be chosen, and at high enough frequency, that
of the total transcription factor, both bound and unbound, does.

(z=0.375) based on the recent multicolor ACS images obtained as part of the

Back in 1987, the giant gravitational arc (z=0.725) in Abell 370 was one of the
first pieces of evidence that massive clusters are dense enough to act as
strong gravitational lenses. The new observations reveal in detail its disklike
morphology, and we show that it can be interpreted as a complex five-image
configuration, with a total magnification factor of 32+/-4. Moreover, the high
resolution multicolor information allowed us to identify 10 multiply imaged
background galaxies. We derive a mean Einstein radius of RE=39+/-2"" for a
source redshift at z=2, corresponding to a mass of M(<RE) = 2.82+/-0.15 1e14
Msol and M(<250 kpc)=3.8+/-0.2 1e14 Msol, in good agreement with Subaru
weak-lensing measurements. The typical mass model error is smaller than 5%, a
factor 3 of improvement compared to the previous lensing analysis. Abell 370
mass distribution is confirmed to be bi-modal with very small offset between
the dark matter, the X-ray gas and the stellar mass. Combining this information
with the velocity distribution reveals that Abell 370 is likely the merging of
two equally massive clusters along the line of sight, explaining the very high
mass density necessary to efficiently produce strong lensing. These new
observations stress the importance of multicolor imaging for the identification
of multiple images which is key to determining an accurate mass model. The very
large Einstein radius makes Abell 370 one of the best clusters to search for
high redshift galaxies through strong magnification in the central region.

0.027 < z < 0.144 - cover a range hitherto sparsely sampled in the literature;
in particular, our SNe II-P sample contains nearly as many SNe in the Hubble
flow (z > 0.01) as all of the current literature on the SCM combined. We find
that the SDSS SNe have a very small intrinsic I-band dispersion (0.22 mag),
which can be attributed to selection effects. When the SCM is applied to the
combined SDSS-plus-literature set of SNe II-P, the dispersion increases to 0.29
mag, larger than the scatter for either set of SNe separately. We show that the
standardization cannot be further improved by eliminating SNe with positive
plateau decline rates, as proposed in Poznanski et al. (2009). We thoroughly
examine all potential systematic effects and conclude that for the SCM to be
useful for cosmology, the methods currently used to determine the Fe II
velocity at day 50 must be improved, and spectral templates able to encompass
the intrinsic variations of Type II-P SNe will be needed.

boundary conditions are generally hampered by exponential slowing down. This is
partly due to interface formation, and partly due to shape transitions. The
latter occur when droplets become large such that they self-interact through
the periodic boundaries. On a spherical simulation topology, however, shape
transitions are absent. By using an appropriate bias function, we expect that
exponential slowing down can be largely eliminated. In this work, these ideas
are applied to the two-dimensional Widom-Rowlinson mixture confined to the
surface of a sphere. Indeed, on the sphere, we find that the number of Monte
Carlo steps needed to sample a first-order phase transition does not increase
exponentially with system size, but rather as a power law $\tau \propto
V^\alpha$, with $\alpha \approx 2.5$, and $V$ the system area. This is
remarkably close to a random walk for which $\alpha$ equals 2. The benefit of
this improved scaling behavior for biased sampling methods, such as the
Wang-Landau algorithm, is investigated in detail.

the ratchet effect, as demonstrated by several recent experiments. In this work
we analyze theoretically two aspects of ac driven transport in cold atoms
ratchets. We first address the issue of whether, and to which extent, an ac
driven ratchet for cold atoms can operate as a motor. We thus study
theoretically a dissipative motor for cold atoms, as obtained by adding a load
to a 1D non-adiabatically driven rocking ratchet. We demonstrate that a current
can be generated also in the presence of a load, e.g. the ratchet device can
operate as a motor. Correspondingly, we determine the stall force for the
motor, which characterizes the range of loads over which the device can operate
as a motor, and the differential mobility, which characterizes the response to
a change in the magnitude of the load. Second, we compare our results for the
transport in an ac driven ratchet device with the transport in a dc driven
system. We observe a peculiar phenomenon: the bi-harmonic ac force stabilizes
the dynamics, allowing the generation of uniform directed motion over a range
of momentum much larger than what is possible with a dc bias. We explain such a
stabilization of the dynamics by observing that a non-adiabatic ac drive
broadens the effective cooling momentum range, and forces the atom trajectories
to cover such a region. Thus the system can dissipate energy and maintain a
steady-state energy balance. Our results show that in the case of a
finite-range velocity-dependent friction, a ratchet device may offer the
possibility of controlling the particle motion over a broader range of momentum
with respect to a purely biased system, although this is at the cost of a
reduced coherency.

energy barriers, arising from changes in intrachain electrostatic interaction,
distribution of ionic clouds and solvent molecules, and conformational entropy
of the chain. All contributing factors to the barrier in the initial stage of
translocation are evaluated by using the self-consistent field theory for the
polyelectrolyte and the coupled Poisson-Boltzmann description for ions, without
radial symmetry. The barrier is found to be essentially entropic, due to
conformational changes. For moderate and high salt concentrations, the barriers
for the polyelectrolyte chain are quantitatively equivalent to that of
uncharged self-avoiding walks. Electrostatic effects are shown to increase the
free energy barriers, but only slightly. The degree of ionization,
electrostatic interaction strength, decreasing salt concentration and the
solvent quality all result in increases in the barrier.

components. The broad velocity absorption shows high opacity on the counter
jet, low opacity against the core and no absorption on the jet side. We argue
that these results are most naturally explained by a circumnuclear HI absorbing
disk orientated roughly perpendicular to the jet axis. We estimate that the HI
absorbing gas lies at a radius of ~80 pc has a scale height of about 20 pc,
density n > 10^{4} cm^{-3} and total column density in the range
10^{23}-10^{24} cm^{-2}. Models in which the HI absorption is primarily from an
atomic or a molecular gas phase can both fit our data. Modelling taking into
account the effective beam shows that the broad HI absorbing gas component does
not cover the radio core in Cygnus A and therefore does not contribute to the
gas column that blocks our view of the hidden quasar nucleus. If however Cygnus
A were observed from a different direction, disk gas on ~100 pc radius scales
would contribute significantly to the nuclear column density, implying that in
some radio galaxies gas on these scales may contribute to the obscuration of
the central engine. We argue that the circumnuclear torus in Cygnus A contains
too little mass to power the AGN over > 10^{7} yr but that material in the
outer HI absorbing gas disk can provide a reservoir to fuel the AGN and
replenish torus clouds. The second narrow HI absorption component is
significantly redshifted (by 186km/s) with respect to the systemic velocity and
probably traces infalling gas which will ultimately fuel the source. [abridged]

The general non-linear solution of the continuity and momentum transfer
equations for the electron fluid along with Poisson's equation is obtained in
simple parametric form. It is shown that in all typical hydrogen plasmas, the
influence of plasma resistivity on the modes in question is negligible. Within
the limitations of the solution found, the non-linear time evolution of any
(periodic) initial electron number density profile n_e(x, t=0) can be
determined (examples). For the modes in question, an idealized model of a
strictly cold and collisionless plasma is shown to be applicable to any real
plasma, provided that the wavelength lambda >> lambda_{min}(n_0,T_e), where n_0
= const and T_e are the equilibrium values of the electron number density and
electron temperature. Within this idealized model, the minimum of the initial
electron density n_e(x_{min}, t=0) must be larger than half its equilibrium
value, n_0/2. Otherwise, the corresponding maximum n_e(x_{max},t=tau_p/2),
obtained after half a period of the plasma oscillation blows up. Relaxation of
this restriction on n_e(x, t=0) as one decreases lambda, due to the increase of
the electron viscosity effects, is examined in detail. Strong plasma viscosity
is shown to change considerably the density profile during the time evolution,

calculated self-consistently via a time-dependent numerical treatment of the

scattering processes. We find that the downstream and upstream regions
contribute almost at the same level to the emission. For the typical parameters
characterising galaxy clusters, the synchrotron and IC peaks in the spectral
energy distributions appear at comparable flux levels. For an efficient
acceleration, the expected emission components in the X-ray and gamma-ray band

utilizes both a visual classification system, and quantitative CAS parameters
to identify systems which show evidence of a recent or ongoing merger of mass
ratio >1/10. Our results are: (1) After visual classification and minimizing
the contamination from false projection pairs, we find that the merger fraction
f_merge is 0.023+/-0.007. The estimated fractions of likely major mergers,
likely minor mergers, and ambiguous cases are 0.01+/-0.004, 0.006+/-0.003, and
0.007+/-0.003, respectively. (2) The mergers lie outside the cluster core of
radius R < 0.25 Mpc: the lack of mergers in the core is likely due to the large
galaxy velocity dispersion in the core. Mergers populate the region (0.25 Mpc <
R <= 2 Mpc) between the core and outskirt. In this region, the estimated
frequency of mergers is similar to those seen at typical group overdensities.
This suggests ongoing growth of the clusters via accretion of group and field
galaxies. (3) We compare our observed merger fraction with those reported in
other clusters and groups out to z~0.4. Existing data points on the merger
fraction for L<= L* galaxies in clusters allow for a range of evolutionary
scenarios. (4) The fraction of mergers, which lie on the blue cloud is
80%+/-18% versus 34%+/-7% for non-interacting galaxies, implying that
interacting galaxies are preferentially blue. (5) The average SFR, based on UV
or UV+IR data, is enhanced by a factor of ~1.5 to 2 in mergers compared to

terminate at the Roche limit. At this point the binary will undergo either
stable mass transfer (SMT) and evolve on a secular time scale, or unstable mass
transfer (UMT), which results in the tidal disruption of the WD. The path a
given binary will follow depends primarily on its mass ratio. We analyze the
fate of known WDNS binaries and use population synthesis results to estimate
the number of LISA-resolved galactic binaries that will undergo either SMT or
UMT. We model the quasistationary SMT epoch by solving a set of simple ordinary
differential equations and compute the corresponding gravitational waveforms.
Finally, we discuss in general terms the possible fate of binaries that undergo
UMT and construct approximate Newtonian equilibrium configurations of merged
WDNS remnants. We use these configurations to assess plausible outcomes of our
future, fully relativistic simulations of these systems. If sufficient WD
debris lands on the NS, the remnant may collapse, whereby the gravitational
waves from the inspiral, merger, and collapse phases will sweep from LISA
through LIGO frequency bands. If the debris forms a disk about the NS, it may
fragment and form planets.

to fainter limits than has been previously probed to z~1. Neither the total nor
the passive or star-forming MF can be well fit with a single Schechter function
once one probes below 3e9 Msun. We observe a dip or plateau at masses ~1e10
Msun, and an upturn towards a steep faint-end slope of -1.7 at lower mass at
any z<1. This bimodal nature of the MF is not solely a result of the blue/red
dichotomy. The blue MF is by itself bimodal at z~1. This suggests a new
dichotomy in galaxy formation that predates the appearance of the red sequence.
We propose two interpretations for this bimodality. If the gas fraction
increases towards lower mass, galaxies with M_baryon~1e10 Msun would shift to
lower stellar masses, creating the observed dip. This would indicate a change
in star formation efficiency, perhaps linked to supernovae feedback becoming
much more efficient. Therefore, we investigate whether the dip is present in
the baryonic (stars+gas) MF. Alternatively, the dip could be created by an
enhancement of the galaxy assembly rate at ~1e11 Msun, a phenomenon that
naturally arises if the baryon fraction peaks at M_halo ~1e12 Msun. In this
scenario, galaxies occupying the bump around M* would be identified with
central galaxies and the second fainter component having a steep faint-end
slope with satellites. While the dip is apparent in the total MF at any z, it
appears to shift from the blue to red population, likely as a result of
transforming high-mass blue galaxies into red ones. At the same time, we detect
a drastic upturn in the number of low-mass red galaxies. Their increase with
time reflects a decrease in the number of blue systems and so we tentatively
associate them with satellite dwarf galaxies that have undergone quenching.

Over the range 0 <= a/M <= 0.9, we find that, for moderately thick disks (H/r ~
0.2) with modest tilt (15 degrees), the inner radius is nearly independent of
spin. This result is likely dependent on tilt, such that for larger tilts, it
may even be that the inner radius would increase with increasing spin. In the
opposite limit, we confirm through numerical simulations of untilted disks
that, in the limit of zero tilt, the inner radius recovers approximately the

discontinuities. String junctions lead to junctions in these line
discontinuities. In turn, edge detection algorithms such as the Canny algorithm
can be used to search for signatures of strings in anisotropy maps. We apply
the Canny algorithm to simulated maps which contain the effects of cosmic
strings with and without string junctions. The Canny algorithm produces edge
maps. To distinguish between edge maps from string simulations with and without
junctions, we examine the density distribution of edges and pixels crossed by
edges. We find that in string simulations without Gaussian noise (such as
produced by the dominant inflationary fluctuations) our analysis of the output
data from the Canny algorithm can clearly distinguish between simulations with
and without string junctions. In the presence of Gaussian noise at the level
expected from the current bounds on the contribution of cosmic strings to the

elusive warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM; 10^5 K<T<10^7 K), which is thought
to contain a substantial fraction of the baryons in the low-redshift Universe.
We present predictions for the soft X-ray line emission from the WHIM using a
subset of cosmological simulations from the OverWhelmingly Large Simulations
(OWLS) project. We use the OWLS models to test the dependence of the predicted
emission on a range of physical prescriptions, such as cosmology, gas cooling
and feedback from star formation and accreting black holes. Provided that
metal-line cooling is taken into account, the models give surprisingly similar
results, indicating that the predictions are robust. Soft X-ray lines trace the
hotter part of the WHIM (T>10^6 K). We find that the OVIII 18.97A is the
strongest emission line, with a predicted maximum surface brightness of ~10^2
photon/s/cm^2/sr, but a number of other lines are only slightly weaker. All
lines show a strong correlation between the intensity of the observed flux and
the density and metallicity of the gas responsible for the emission. On the
other hand, the potentially detectable emission consistently corresponds to the
temperature at which the emissivity of the electronic transition peaks. The
emission traces neither the baryonic nor the metal mass. In particular, the
emission that is potentially detectable with proposed missions, traces
overdense (rho>10^2rho_mean) and metal-rich (Z>0.1Z_sun) gas in and around
galaxies and groups. While soft X-ray line emission is therefore not a
promising route to close the baryon budget, it does offer the exciting
possibility to image the gas accreting onto and flowing out of galaxies.

nearby long GRBs imply that an accompanying supernova-like component might be a
common feature in all long GRB events. These motivate us to study the
interactions of a late jet, responsible for a x-ray flare, with various
components in a stellar explosion, responsible for a GRB. These components
include a supernova shell-like ejecta, and a cocoon that was produced when the
main jet producing the GRB itself was propagating through the progenitor star.
We find that the interaction between the late jet and the supernova ejecta may
produce a luminous (up to 10^49 erg s^-1) thermal X-ray transient lasting for ~
10 s. The interaction between the late jet and the cocoon produces synchrotron
self-absorbed non-thermal emission, with the observed peak X-ray flux density
from 0.001 micro Jy to 1 mJy at 1 keV and a peak optical flux density from 0.01
micro Jy to 0.1 Jy (for a redshift z= 2). The light curve due to the late jet -
cocoon interaction has very small pulse-width-to-time ratio, \Delta t / t
\approx 0.01 - 0.5, where t is the pulse peak time since the burst trigger.

initially eccentric co or counter-rotating coplanar orbits relative to the
disc's rotation, and accrete gas that is carrying a net angular momentum. As
the black hole mass grows, its spin changes in strength and direction due to
its gravito-magnetic coupling with the small-scale accretion disc. We find that
the black hole spins loose memory of their initial orientation, as accretion
torques suffice to align the spins with the angular momentum of their orbit on
a short timescale (<1-2 Myr). A residual off-set in the spin direction relative
to the orbital angular momentum remains, at the level of <10 degrees for the
case of a cold disc, and <30 degrees for a warmer disc. Alignment in a cooler
disc is more effective due to the higher coherence of the accretion flow near
each black hole that reflects the large-scale coherence of the disc's rotation.
If the massive black holes coalesce preserving the spin directions set after
formation of a Keplerian binary, the relic black hole resulting from their
coalescence receives a relatively small gravitational recoil. The distribution
of recoil velocities inferred from a simulated sample of massive black hole
binaries has median <70 km/s much smaller than the median resulting from an

address several different aspects of the demanding photo-z performance that
will be required for future experiments, such as the proposed ESA Euclid
mission. It is first shown that the proposed all-sky near-infrared photometry
from Euclid, in combination with anticipated ground-based photometry (e.g.
PanStarrs-2 or DES) should yield the required precision in individual photo-z
of sigma(z) < 0.05(1+z) at I_AB < 24.5. Simple a priori rejection schemes based
on the photometry alone can be tuned to recognise objects with wildly
discrepant photo-z and to reduce the outlier fraction to < 0.25% with only
modest loss of otherwise usable objects. Turning to the more challenging
problem of determining the mean redshift <z> of a set of galaxies to a
precision of 0.002(1+z) we argue that, for many different reasons, this is best
accomplished by relying on the photo-z themselves rather than on the direct
measurement of <z> from spectroscopic redshifts of a representative subset of
the galaxies. A simple adaptive scheme based on the statistical properties of
the photo-z likelihood functions is shown to meet this stringent systematic
requirement. We also examine the effect of an imprecise correction for Galactic
extinction and the effects of contamination by fainter over-lapping objects in
photo-z determination. The overall conclusion of this work is that the
acquisition of photometrically estimated redshifts with the precision required

as $U$ becomes finite fermions are liberated but are naturally confined to
regions which we refer to as {\em fermion bags}. The fermion sign problem is
then confined to these bags and may be solved using the determinantal trick. In
the parameter regime where the fermion bags are small and their typical size
does not grow with the system size, construction of Monte Carlo methods that
are far more efficient than conventional algorithms should be possible. In the
region where the fermion bags grow with system size, the fermion bag approach
continues to provide an alternative approach to the problem but may lose its
main advantage in terms of efficiency. The fermion bag approach also provides
new insights and solutions to sign problems. A natural solution to the ""silver

resolution of Hinode's SOT/SP. Then, following observational practice, we apply
Milne-Eddington-type inversions to the synthetic spectra in order to retrieve
various atmospheric parameters and compare the results with recent Hinode
observations. During the emergence sequence, the spectral lines sample
different parts of the rising flux tube, revealing its twisted structure. The
horizontal component of the magnetic field retrieved from the simulations is
close to the observed values. The flattening of the flux tube in the
photosphere is caused by radiative cooling, which slows down the ascent of the
tube to the upper solar atmosphere. Consistent with the observations, the
rising magnetized plasma produces a blue shift of the spectral lines during a
large part of the emergence sequence.

consistent treatment of microstructure elastic mechanics, hydrodynamic

description in terms of Eulerian and Lagrangian reference frames is used for
the physical system. Microstructure configurations are represented in a
Lagrangian reference frame. Conserved quantities, such as momentum of the fluid
and microstructures, are represented in an Eulerian reference frame. The
mathematical formalism couples these different descriptions using general
operators subject to consistency conditions. Thermal fluctuations are taken
into account in the formalism by stochastic driving fields introduced in
accordance with the principles of statistical mechanics. To study the
rheological responses of materials subject to shear, generalized periodic
boundary conditions are developed where periodic images are shifted relative to
the unit cell to induce shear. Stochastic numerical methods are developed for
the formalism. As a demonstration of the methods, results are presented for the
shear responses of a polymeric fluid, lipid vesicle fluid, and a gel-like

chamber may be comparable to the length-scale associated with the solute-wall

that notions of osmotic pressure based on the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid

thermal fluctuations. A stochastic numerical method is proposed which deals
with stiffness in the system of equations by handling systematically the
statistical contributions of the fastest dynamics of the fluid and immersed
structures over long time steps. An important feature of the numerical method
is that time steps can be taken in which the degrees of freedom of the fluid
are completely underresolved, partially resolved, or fully resolved while
retaining a good level of accuracy. Error estimates in each of these regimes
are given for the method. A number of theoretical and numerical checks are
furthermore performed to assess its physical fidelity. For a conservative
force, the method is found to simulate particles with the correct Boltzmann
equilibrium statistics. It is shown in three dimensions that the diffusion of
immersed particles simulated with the method has the correct scaling in the
physical parameters. The method is also shown to reproduce a well-known
hydrodynamic effect of a Brownian particle in which the velocity
autocorrelation function exhibits an algebraic tau^(-3/2) decay for long times.
A few preliminary results are presented for more complex systems which
demonstrate some potential application areas of the method.

  Although the ANEC can be violated on general geodesics in curved spacetimes,
as long as the ANEC holds on null lines there exist theorems showing that

censorship, and should not admit closed timelike curves. It is pointed out that

by the conditional entropy of the source given the coded output of Alice. We
completely characterize the rate-equivocation region for this secure source
coding model, where we show that Slepian-Wolf binning of X with respect to the
coded side information received at Bob is optimal. We next consider a
modification of this model in which Alice also has access to the coded output
of Helen. For the two-sided helper model, we characterize the rate-equivocation
region. While the availability of side information at Alice does not reduce the
rate of transmission from Alice, it significantly enhances the resulting
equivocation at Eve. In particular, the resulting equivocation for the
two-sided helper case is shown to be min(H(X),R_y), i.e., one bit from the
two-sided helper provides one bit of uncertainty at Eve. From this result, we
infer that Slepian-Wolf binning of X is suboptimal and one can further decrease
the information leakage to the eavesdropper by utilizing the side information
at Alice. We finally generalize these results to the case in which there is

recombination including rearrangement, segmental duplication, gain, and loss
can create a mosaic pattern of homology even among closely related organisms.
We describe a method to align two or more genomes that have undergone
large-scale recombination, particularly genomes that have undergone substantial
amounts of gene gain and loss (gene flux). The method utilizes a novel
alignment objective score, referred to as a sum-of-pairs breakpoint score. We
also apply a probabilistic alignment filtering method to remove erroneous
alignments of unrelated sequences, which are commonly observed in other genome
alignment methods. We describe new metrics for quantifying genome alignment
accuracy which measure the quality of rearrangement breakpoint predictions and
indel predictions. The progressive genome alignment algorithm demonstrates
markedly improved accuracy over previous approaches in situations where genomes
have undergone realistic amounts of genome rearrangement, gene gain, loss, and
duplication. We apply the progressive genome alignment algorithm to a set of 23
completely sequenced genomes from the genera Escherichia, Shigella, and
Salmonella. The 23 enterobacteria have an estimated 2.46Mbp of genomic content
conserved among all taxa and total unique content of 15.2Mbp. We document
substantial population-level variability among these organisms driven by
homologous recombination, gene gain, and gene loss. Free, open-source software

hooking the ends of a $ggg$ vertex to 3 distinct ${\bar q}gq$ vertices, thus
making up a $Y$-shaped diagram (see fig.1). The high degree of $S_3$ symmetry
thus involved ensures that the $qqq$ wave function is a mixture of $56, 0^+$

two-point boundary value problem for one-dimensional wave equation defined on a
closed curve and prove the existence of smooth solution which implies the exact

study the two-point boundary value problems for the wave equation defined on a

of interest, and $\omega_c$ the cut-off frequency of Ohmic reservoir. We give a
stationary analysis of the concurrence and find that the dynamic of

concurrence always disappear at finite time when $k_BT>0$, which means that ESD
must happen. The main result of this paper is that the non-Markovian
entanglement dynamic is fundamentally different from the Markovian one. In the
Markovian channel, entanglement decays exponentially and vanishes only
asymptotically, but in the non-Markovian channel the concurrence
$\mathcal{C}_{\rho}(t)$ oscillates, especially in the high temperature case.
Then an open-loop controller adjusted by the temperature is proposed to control
the entanglement and prolong the ESD time.

Then, we focus on large rates of decoherence and calculate the probability

Briefly summarized it states that the random transfer matrices placed into a

process with a unique invariant measure which is of geometric nature. On the
elliptic part of the transfer matrices, this measure is invariant under the
full hermitian symplectic group of the universality class under study. While
the random phase property can up to now only be proved in special models or in
a restricted sense, we provide strong numerical evidence that it holds in the
Anderson model of localization. A main outcome of the random phase property is
a perturbative calculation of the Lyapunov exponents which shows that the
Lyapunov spectrum is equidistant and that the localization lengths for large
systems in the unitary, orthogonal and symplectic ensemble differ by a factor 2
each. In an Anderson-Ando model on a tubular geometry with magnetic field and
spin-orbit coupling, the normal system of coordinates is calculated and this is
used to derive explicit energy dependent formulas for the Lyapunov spectrum.

conditions between the quantum states of the two layers, mathematically
expressed as Diophantine problems. Based on this general analysis we
demonstrate that while the Dirac cones from each layer are always effectively
degenerate, the Fermi velocity $v_F$ of the Dirac cones decreases as $\theta\to

continuum approximation in Phys. Rev. Lett., 99:256802, 2007. From tight

strongly warped as the limit $\theta \to 0$ is approached. For an ideal system

be mainly produced by dust heated by old rather than young stars. Besides, the

however, STM images suffer from a serious drawback - the absence of chemical
information. Here we demonstrate a modification of STM that resolves the
chemical structure of molecular adsorbates. The key to the new STM mode is a
combined force sensor and signal transducer that is formed within the
tunnelling junction when a suitable gas condenses there. The method probes the
repulsive branch of the surface adsorption potential and transforms the force
signal into a current. Obtained images achieve the same resolution as
state-of-the-art atomic force microscopy (AFM). In contrast to AFM, however,
our (uncalibrated) force sensor is of nanoscale dimensions and therefore
intrinsically insensitive to those long-range interactions that make
atomic-resolution AFM so demanding.

general finite-range nonseparable potential. This situation can appear either
in a Cartesian geometry or in a heterostructure with cylindrical symmetry.
Increasing the dimensionality of the scattering problem new processes as the
scattering between conducting channels and the scattering from conducting to
evanescent channels are allowed. For certain values of the energy called
resonance energy the transmission through the scattering region changes
dramatically in comparison with an one-dimensional problem. If the potential
has an attractive character even the evanescent channels can be seen as dips of
the total transmission. The multi-channel current scattering matrix is
determined using its representation in terms of the R-matrix. The resonant
transmission peaks are characterized quantitatively through the poles of the
current scattering matrix. Detailed maps of the localization probability

Einstein's theory of relativity. An astronaut who makes a journey into space in
a high-speed rocket will return home to find he has aged less than a twin who
stayed on Earth. This result appears puzzling, since the situation seems
symmetrical, as the homebody twin can be considered to have done the travelling
with respect to the traveller. Hence it is called a ""paradox"". In fact, there
is no contradiction and the apparent paradox has a simple resolution in Special
Relativity with infinite flat space. In General Relativity (dealing with
gravitational fields and curved space-time), or in a compact space such as the
hypersphere or a multiply connected finite space, the paradox is more
complicated, but its resolution provides new insights about the structure of
spacetime and the limitations of the equivalence between inertial reference

the differential equations describing real processes are not integrable without
additional conditions. This follows from the functional relation that is
derived from these equations. Such a relation connects the differential of
state functional and the skew-symmetric form. This relation proves to be
nonidentical, and this fact points to the nonintegrability of the equations. In
this case a solution to the equations is a functional, which depends on the
commutator of skew-symmetric form that appears to be unclosed. However, under
realization of the conditions of degenerate transformations, from the
nonidentical relation it follows the identical one on some structure. This
points out to the local integrability and realization of a generalized
solution.
  In doing so, in addition to the exterior forms, the skew-symmetric forms,
which, in contrast to exterior forms, are defined on nonintegrable manifolds
(such as tangent manifolds of differential equations, Lagrangian manifolds and
so on), were used.

first compute local diffusion coefficients, which characterize chaotic
diffusion in proper eccentricity (e_p) and inclination (I_p), in a selected
phase-space region. Then, a Monte-Carlo-type code is constructed and used to
track the evolution of random walkers (i.e. asteroids), by coupling diffusion
in (e_p,I_p) with a drift in proper semi-major axis (a_p) induced by the
Yarkovsky/YORP thermal effects. We validate our model by applying it to the
family of (490) Veritas, for which we recover previous estimates of its age
(~8.3 Myr). Moreover, we show that the spreading of chaotic family members in
proper elements space is well reproduced in our random-walk simulations.
Finally, we apply our model to the family of (3556) Lixiaohua, which is much
older than Veritas and thus much more affected by thermal forces. We find the
age of the Lixiaohua family to be 155+/-36 Myr.

appears as irregular pulse phase jumps on timescales from hours to weeks. A
large systematic phase drift is also observed in the first discovered AMP SAX
J1808.4-3658. To study the origin of these timing features, we use here the
data of the well studied 2002 outburst of SAX J1808.4-3658. We develop first a
model for pulse profile formation accounting for the screening of the antipodal
emitting spot by the accretion disk. We demonstrate that the variations of the
visibility of the antipodal spot associated with the receding accretion disk
cause a systematic shift in Fourier phases, observed together with the changes
in the pulse form. We show that a strong secondary maximum can be observed only
in a narrow intervals of inner disk radii, which explains the very short
appearance of the double-peaked profiles in SAX J1808.4-3658. By directly
fitting the pulse profile shapes with our model, we find that the main
parameters of the emitting spot such as its mean latitude and longitude as well
as the emissivity pattern change irregularly causing small shifts in pulse
phase, and the strong profile variations are caused by the increasing inner
disk radius. We finally notice that significant variations in the pulse
profiles in the 2002 and 2008 outbursts of SAX J1808.4-3658 happen at fluxes
differing by a factor of 2, which can be explained if the inner disk radius is
not a simple function of the accretion rate, but depends on the previous

that the gap symmetries are simply determined by the 4-fold rotational
symmetries of the coupling potential on neighbor sites. A local on-site
coupling potential results in the on-site pairing with the conventional s-wave
symmetry, but a coupling potential between the nearest neighbors or the
next-nearest neighbors results in the pairing on neighbor sites with the $s^-$,
$d_{x^2-y^2}$, $d_{xy}$, or $s_{x^2y^2}$ gap symmetries. It is proved that both
isotropic and anisotropic gap functions are allowed by the 4-fold rotational

sufficient scale and their overall dimensions were below 300 nm, the
translational and rotational diffusion coefficients of particle duplets,
triplets and tetrahedrons could be determined by a combination of polarized
dynamic light scattering (DLS) and depolarized dynamic light scattering (DDLS).
The use of colloidal clusters for DDLS experiments overcomes the limitation of
earlier experiments on the diffusion of complex objects near surfaces because
the true 3D diffusion can be studied. When the exact geometry of the complex
assemblies is known, different hydrodynamic models for calculating the
diffusion coefficient for objects with complex shapes could be applied. Because
hydrodynamic friction must be restricted to the cluster surface the so-called
shell model, in which the surface is represented as a shell of small friction
elements, was most suitable to describe the dynamics. A quantitative comparison

bifurcation points of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium sequences and the
points of linear ideal MHD instability is investigated imposing line-tied
boundary conditions. Using a well-studied example based on the Gold-Hoyle
equilibrium, it is demonstrated that if the equilibrium sequence is calculated
using the Grad-Shafranov equation, the instability corresponds to the second
bifurcation point and not the first bifurcation point because the equilibrium
boundary conditions allow for modes which are excluded from the linear ideal
stability analysis. This is shown by calculating the bifurcating equilibrium
branches and comparing the spatial structure of the solutions close to the
bifurcation point with the spatial structure of the unstable mode. If the
equilibrium sequence is calculated using Euler potentials the first bifurcation
point of the Grad-Shafranov case is not found, and the first bifurcation point
of the Euler potential description coincides with the ideal instability
threshold. An explanation of this results in terms of linear bifurcation theory

knotted piece of rope, i.e., represent the particular spatial configuration of
a knot tied in a rope in 3-space. This quantum system, called a quantum knot
system, is physically implementable in the same sense as Shor's quantum
factoring algorithm is implementable.
  To define a quantum knot system, we replace the standard three Reidemeister
knot moves with an equivalent set of three moves, called respectively wiggle,
wag, and tug, so named because they mimic how a dog might wag its tail. We
argue that these moves are in fact more ""physics friendly"" because, unlike the
Reidemeister moves, they respect the differential geometry of 3-space, and
moreover they can be transformed into infinitesimal moves.
  These three moves wiggle, wag, and tug generate a unitary group, called the
lattice ambient group, which acts on the state space of the quantum system. The
lattice ambient group represents all possible ways of moving a rope around in
3-space without cutting the rope, and without letting the rope pass through
itself.
  We then investigate those quantum observables of the quantum knot system
which are knot invariants. We also study Hamiltonians associated with the
generators of the lattice ambient group. We conclude with a list of open

rotating magnetic field or an ac gate voltage using the Floquet master-equation
approach. Both types of ac driving lead to photon-assisted tunneling where
quantized amounts of energy are exchanged with the driving field. It is found
that the differential-conductance peak due to photon-assisted tunneling does
not survive in the Coulomb-blockade regime when the dot is driven by a rotating
magnetic field. Furthermore, we generalize the MacDonald formula to calculate
the time-averaged noise spectra of ac-driven quantum dots. Besides the peak at
zero frequency, the noise spectra show additional peaks or dips in the presence
of an ac field. For the case of an applied ac gate voltage, the peak or dip
position is fixed at the driving frequency, whereas the position changes with
increasing amplitude for the case of a rotating magnetic field. Additional
features appear in the noise spectra if a dc magnetic field is applied in
addition to a rotating field. In all cases, the peak or dip positions can be
understood from the energy differences of two available Floquet channels.

globally well-posed in $H^s$ for $s\geq -7/4$ by using the ideas of ""I-method""
\cite{I-method}. Compared to the KdV equation, Kawahara equation has less
symmetries, such as no invariant scaling transform and not completely
integrable. The new ingredient is that we need to deal with some new
difficulties that are caused by the lack symmetries of this equation.

a single crystal of \ycs. $M$ was measured down to 0.05 K and in fields up to
12 T, with the magnetic field $H$ parallel to the crystallographic direction
[100]. Two antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase transitions have been detected in a
field $\mu_{0}H = 0.1$ T at $T_{N} = 1.75$ K and $T_{L} = 0.9$ K, in form of a
sharp cusp and a sudden drop in $\chi = M/H$, respectively. These signatures
suggest that the phase transitions are $2^{nd}$ order at $T_{N}$ and $1^{st}$
order at $T_{L}$. The upper transition is suppressed by a critical field
$\mu_{0}H_{N} = 1.9$ T. The field-dependent magnetisation shows two hysteretic
metamagnetic-like steps at the lowest temperature, followed by a sharp kink,
which separates the AFM region from the paramagnetic one. The magnetic $H - T$
phase diagram of \ycs has been deduced from the isothermal and isofield curves.
Four AFM regions were identified which are separated by $1^{st}$ and $2^{nd}$
order phase-transition lines.
