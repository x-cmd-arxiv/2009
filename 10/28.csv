nuclear energy density functionals (EDFs) from underlying inter-nucleon
interactions and many-body perturbation theory (MBPT). The density matrix
expansion (DME) of Negele and Vautherin is a convenient method to map highly
non-local Hartree-Fock expressions into the form of a quasi-local Skyrme
functional with density-dependent couplings. In this work, we assess the
accuracy of the DME at reproducing the non-local exchange (Fock) contribution
to the energy. In contrast to the scalar part of the density matrix for which
the original formulation of Negele and Vautherin is reasonably accurate, we
demonstrate the necessity to reformulate the DME for the vector part of the
density matrix, which is needed for an accurate description of spin-unsaturated
nuclei. Phase-space averaging techniques are shown to yield a significant
improvement for the vector part of the density matrix compared to the original
formulation of Negele and Vautherin. The key to the improved accuracy is to
take into account the anisotropy that characterizes the local-momentum
distribution in the surface region of finite Fermi systems. Optimizing
separately the DME for the central, tensor and spin-orbit contributions to the
Fock energy, one reaches a few-percent accuracy over a representative set of
semi-magic nuclei. With such an accuracy at hand, one can envision using the
corresponding Skyrme-like energy functional as a microscopically-constrained
starting point around which future phenomenological parameterizations can be
built and refined.

science aim is to test the standard hierarchical structure formation paradigm
of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) on scales of galaxy groups, pairs, discs, bulges and
bars. We will measure (1) the Dark Matter Halo Mass Function (as inferred from
galaxy group velocity dispersions); (2) baryonic processes, such as star

pairs and galaxy asymmetries). Additionally, GAMA will form the central part of
a new galaxy database, which aims to contain 275,000 galaxies with
multi-wavelength coverage from coordinated observations with the latest
international ground- and space-based facilities: GALEX, VST, VISTA, WISE,
HERSCHEL, GMRT and ASKAP. Together, these data will provide increased depth
(over 2 magnitudes), doubled spatial resolution (0.7""), and significantly
extended wavelength coverage (UV through Far-IR to radio) over the main SDSS

can appear as a promising framework for modern physics. Quantum field theories
on ""noncommutative spaces"" are indeed much investigated, and suffer from a new
type of divergence called the ultraviolet-infrared mixing. However, this
problem has recently been solved by H. Grosse and R. Wulkenhaar by adding to
the action of a noncommutative scalar model a harmonic term, which renders it
renormalizable.
  One aim of this thesis is the extension of this procedure to gauge theories
on the Moyal space. Indeed, we have introduced a new noncommutative gauge
theory, strongly related to the Grosse-Wulkenhaar model, and candidate to
renormalizability. We have then studied the most important properties of this
action, and in particular its vacuum configurations. Finally, we give a
mathematical interpretation of this new action in terms of a derivation-based
differential calculus associated to a superalgebra.

question ""in what sense is gravity a gauge theory?"" I will reformulate the
theory of gravity in a general kinematical setting which highlights the
presence of two Goldstone boson-like fields, and the occurrence of a
gravitational Higgs phenomenon. The fact that in General Relativity the
connection is a derived quantity appears to be a low energy consequence of this
Higgs phenomenon. From here it is simple to see how to embed the group of local
frame transformations and a Yang Mills group into a larger unifying group, and
how the distinction between these groups, and the corresponding interactions,
derives from the VEV of an order parameter. I will describe in some detail the
fermionic sector of a realistic ""GraviGUT"" with SO(3,1)xSO(10) \subset
SO(3,11). In the second lecture I will discuss the possibility that the
renormalization group flow of gravity has a fixed point with a finite number of
attractive directions. This would make the theory well behaved in the
ultraviolet, and predictive, in spite of being perturbatively
nonrenormalizable. There is by now a significant amount of evidence that this
may be the case. There are thus reasons to believe that quantum field theory
may eventually prove sufficient to explain the mysteries of gravity.

coalescence of strange stars (SSs) and explore the possibility to decide on the
strange matter hypothesis by means of gravitational-wave (GW) measurements.
Selfbinding of strange quark matter (SQM) and the generally more compact stars
yield features that clearly distinguish SS from neutron star (NS) mergers, e.g.
hampering tidal disruption during the plunge of quark stars. Furthermore,
instead of forming dilute halos around the remnant as in the case of NS
mergers, the coalescence of SSs results in a differentially rotating
hypermassive object with a sharp surface layer surrounded by a geometrically
thin, clumpy high-density SQM disk. We also investigate the importance of
including non-zero temperature equations of state (EoSs) in NS and SS merger
simulations. In both cases we find a crucial sensitivity of the dynamics and
outcome of the coalescence to thermal effects, which, e.g., determine the outer
remnant structure and the delay time of the dense remnant core to black hole
collapse. For comparing and classifying the GW signals, we use a number of
characteristic quantities like the maximum frequency during inspiral or the
dominant frequency of oscillations of the postmerger remnant. In general, these
frequencies are higher for SS mergers. If not, additional features of the GW
luminosity spectrum may help to discriminate coalescence events of the
different types. Future GW measurements may thus help to decide on the
existence of SQM stars. (abridged)

performed. When combined with the radial velocity (RV) and the spectroscopic

travelling at $\approx$590 \kms, possibly unbound to the Galaxy and originating
in the outer Galactic rim nowhere near the Galactic centre. J0136+2425 is the
second HVS candidate with measured proper motion, besides the massive B star HD
271791, and also the second for which its proper motion excludes a Galactic
centre origin and, hence, the SMBH slingshot mechanism. Most known HVS are late
B-type stars of about 3 M$_\odot$. With a mass of 2.45 M$_\odot$, J0136+2425
resembles a typical HVS far more than HD 271791 does. Hence, this is the first
time that a typical HVS is found not to originate in the Galactic centre. Its
ejection velocity from the disk is so high (550 \kms) that the extreme
supernova binary scenario proposed for HD 271791 is very unlikely.

Solar Optical Telescope in unprecedented detail. The ejection occurred in three
episodes separated by 12-14 min, with the amount and velocity of material
decreasing with time. The upward velocities range from 438 to 33 km/s, while
the downward velocities of the material falling back have smaller values (mean:
-56 km/s) and a narrower distribution (standard deviation: 14 km/s). The
average acceleration inferred from parabolic space-time tracks is 141 m/s^2, a
fraction of the solar gravitational acceleration. The jet consists of fine
threads (0.5-2.0 arcsec wide), which exhibit coherent, oscillatory transverse
motions perpendicular to the jet axis and about a common equilibrium position.
These motions propagate upward along the jet, with the maximum phase speed of
744 +/- 11 km/s at the leading front of the jet. The transverse oscillation
velocities range from 151 to 26 km/s, amplitudes from 6.0 to 1.9 Mm, and
periods from 250 to 536 s. The oscillations slow down with time and cease when
the material starts to fall back. The falling material travels along almost
straight lines in the original direction of ascent, showing no transverse
motions. These observations are consistent with the scenario that the jet

the low corona above plage regions (Hara et al., 2008). The latter have been
shown to be directly associated with high-velocity chromospheric spicules that
are (partially) heated to coronal temperatures and play a significant role in
supplying the active region corona with hot plasma (DePontieu et al., 2009}. We
show that a similar process likely dominates the quiet Sun network. We provide
a new interpretation of the observed quiet Sun TR emission in terms of the
relentless mass transport between the chromosphere and corona - a mixture of
emission from dynamic episodic heating and mass injection into the corona as
well as that from the previously filled, slowly cooling, coronal plasma.
Analysis of the observed upflow component shows that it carries enough hot
plasma to play a significant role in the energy and mass balance of the quiet
corona. We determine the temperature dependence of the upflow velocities to
constrain the acceleration and heating mechanism that drives these upflows. We
also show that the temporal characteristics of these upflows suggest an
episodic driver that sometimes leads to quasi-periodic signals. We suggest that
at least some of the quasi-periodicities observed with coronal imagers and
spectrographs that have previously been interpreted as propagating
magnetoacoustic waves, may instead be caused by these upflows.

the UV divergent part of the one-loop background-field effective action

It turns out that, for special choices of the ambiguous trace over the gauge
degrees of freedom, for which the O(theta) triple gauge-field interactions
vanish, the divergences can be absorbed by means of multiplicative
renormalisations and the inclusion of theta-dependent counterterms that vanish
on-shell and are thus unphysical. For this to happen in the SU(N), N>2 case,
the representations of the matter fields must have a common second Casimir;
anomaly cancellation then requires the ordinary (commutative) matter content to
be non-chiral. Together with the vanishing of the divergences of fermionic four

0.05 and 4 K is presented. The proposed setup can provide absolute values of
the heat capacity $C$ of small samples (typically 1 mg). The extremely simple
design of the sample platform, based on a sapphire substrate, and the
experimental setup, which makes use only of a lock-in amplifier and a
temperature controller, make the construction of such a calorimeter easy and
inexpensive. The thermal-relaxation method is employed, which utilizes a
permanent thermal link $k$ between the sample platform and the low-temperature
bath. The temperature dependence of $k(T)$ is shown for several platforms
throughout the entire temperature range: $k(T)/T$ is nearly constant down to 1
K, where it starts to decrease smoothly. The observed behavior is thoroughly
explained by considering the thermal resistances of the platform constituents.
A comparison between the values of $k(T)/T$ for platforms based on sapphire and
on silver is presented where no significant difference has been observed. Each
platform can be assembled to have a particular value of $k/T$ at 1 K. Since the
sample relaxation time $\tau \sim C/k$, $k(T)$ can be adjusted to $C(T)$ to
give a reasonably fast measuring time: Here, it is demonstrated how this
calorimeter can be used in so-called single-shot refrigerators ($^{3}$He or
demagnetization cryostats), where the time for a single measurement is limited.
In addition, it can be used in moderate magnetic fields $B \leq 10$ T, because
the platform constituents are weakly field dependent.

dissipative quantum system. Optimal control using Pontryagin maximum principle
is specifically derived. The influences of Ohmic reservoir with Lorentz-Drude
regularization are numerically studied in a two-level system under the
following three conditions: \omega_0\ll\omega_c, \omega_0\approx\omega_c or
\omega_0\gg\omega_c, where \omega_0 is the characteristic frequency of the
quantum system of interest, and \omega_c the cut-off frequency of Ohmic
reservoir. The optimal control process shows its remarkable influences on the
decoherence dynamics. The temperature is a key factor in the decoherence
dynamics. We analyze the optimal decoherence control in high temperature,
intermediate temperature, and low temperature reservoirs respectively. It
implies that designing some engineered reservoirs with the controlled coupling
and state of the environment can slow down the decoherence rate and delay the
decoherence time. Moreover, we compare the non-Markovian optimal decoherence
control with the Markovian one and find that with non-Markovian the engineered
artificial reservoirs are better than with the Markovian approximation in
controlling the open, dissipative quantum system's decoherence.

Crocce & Scoccimarro (2006a) to deal with multiple fluids in the Universe and
here we present calculations up to the one-loop level. We apply the approach to
the non-linear evolution of baryon and cold dark matter (CDM) perturbations,
evolving from distinct sets of initial conditions. In current models of
structure formation, it is standard practice to treat baryons and CDM as an
effective single component fluid. In this approximation, one uses a weighed sum
of late-time baryon and CDM transfer functions to set initial conditions. Here,
we explore whether this approach can be used for high precision work. We show
that, even for a pure linear treatment, there is a large-scale scale-dependent
bias between baryons and CDM for WMAP5 cosmology. This bias is >1% until the
present day, when it is driven towards unity through gravitational relaxation.
Using the RPT formalism we test this approximation in the non-linear regime,
and show that the CDM power spectrum in the 2-component fluid differs from that
obtained from a 1-component fluid by ~3% on scales of order k~0.05 h/Mpc at
z=10, and by ~0.5% at z=0. However, for the case of baryons the situation is
worse and we find that the power spectrum is suppressed by ~15% on scales
k~0.05 h/Mpc at z=10, and by ~3-5% at z=0, relative to the total matter.
Importantly, besides the suppression of the spectrum, baryonic acoustic
oscillations (BAO) are amplified for baryon and damped for CDM spectra. Thus,
high precision modeling of baryons can not be probed through CDM only
simulations; detection significance of BAO will be amplified in probes that
study baryonic matter. Total mass can be modeled accurately using a 1-component
fluid approach at all times. (Abridged)

observations of the dusty debris disk HD 61005. The scattered light intensity
image and polarization structure reveal a highly inclined disk with a clear
asymmetric, swept back component, suggestive of significant interaction with
the ambient interstellar medium. The combination of our new data with the
published 1.1 micron discovery image shows that the grains are blue scattering
with no strong color gradient as a function of radius, implying predominantly
sub-micron sized grains. We investigate possible explanations that could
account for the observed swept back, asymmetric morphology. Previous work has
suggested that HD 61005 may be interacting with a cold, unusually dense
interstellar cloud. However, limits on the intervening interstellar gas column
density from an optical spectrum of HD 61005 in the Na I D lines render this
possibility unlikely. Instead, HD 61005 may be embedded in a more typical warm,
low-density cloud that introduces secular perturbations to dust grain orbits.
This mechanism can significantly distort the ensemble disk structure within a
typical cloud crossing time. For a counterintuitive relative flow
direction--parallel to the disk midplane--we find that the structures generated
by these distortions can very roughly approximate the HD 61005 morphology.
Future observational studies constraining the direction of the relative
interstellar medium flow will thus provide an important constraint for future
modeling. Independent of the interpretation for HD 61005, we expect that
interstellar gas drag likely plays a role in producing asymmetries observed in
other debris disk systems, such as HD 15115 and Delta-Velorum.

effects of the non-adiabatic electron heating efficiency, \beta, on the degree
of non-equipartition are also studied. Using the gas fraction f_gas = 0.17
(which is the upper limit for a cluster), we give a conservative lower limit of
the non-equipartition effect on clusters. Beyond the virial radius, the
non-equipartition effect depends rather strongly on \beta, and such a strong
dependence at the shock radius can be used to distinguish shock heating models
or constrain the shock heating efficiency of electrons. We have also studied
systematically the signatures of non-equipartition on X-ray and SZ observables.
We have calculated the effect of non-equipartition on the projected temperature
and X-ray surface brightness profiles using the MEKAL emission model. The
non-equipartition effect can introduce a ~10% bias in the projected temperature
at R_vir for a wide range of \beta. We also found that the effect of
non-equipartition on the projected temperature profiles can be enhanced by
increasing metallicity. We found that for our model in the \LambdaCDM Universe,
the integrated SZ bias, Y_{non-eq}/Y_{eq}, evolves slightly (at a percentage
level) with redshift, which is in contrast to the self-similar model in the
Einstein-de Sitter Universe. This may introduce biases in cosmological studies
using the f_gas technique. We discussed briefly whether the equipartition and
non-equipartition models near the shock region can be distinguished by future
radio observations with, for example, ALMA.

characterising the bolometric output of both obscured and unobscured AGN by
combining the hard X-ray data from Swift/BAT (14-195keV) with the reprocessed
IR emission as seen with the IRAS all-sky surveys. This approach bypasses the
complex modifications to the SED introduced by absorption in the optical, UV
and 0.1-10 keV regimes and provides a long-term, average picture of the
bolometric output of these sources. We broadly follow the approach of Pozzi et
al. for calculating the bolometric luminosities by adding nuclear IR and hard
X-ray luminosities, and consider different approaches for removing non-nuclear
contamination in the large-aperture IRAS fluxes. Using mass estimates from the
M_BH-L_bulge relation, we present the Eddington ratios \lambda_Edd and 2-10 keV
bolometric corrections for a subsample of 63 AGN (35 obscured and 28
unobscured) from the Swift/BAT catalogue, and confirm previous indications of a
low Eddington ratio distribution for both samples. Importantly, we find a
tendency for low bolometric corrections (typically 10-30) for the obscured AGN
in the sample (with a possible rise from ~15 for \lambda_Edd<0.03 to ~32 above
this), providing a hitherto unseen window onto accretion processes in this
class of AGN. This finding is of key importance in calculating the expected
local black hole mass density from the X-ray background since it is composed of
emission from a significant population of such obscured AGN. Analogous studies
with high resolution IR data and a range of alternative models for the torus
emission will form useful future extensions to this work. (Abridged)

flow and the rotation of the compact object can be the energy source of the
GRB. The major problem in this scenario is the difficulty of finding an
astrophysical mechanism for obtaining such intense fields. Whereas, in
principle, a neutron star could maintain such strong fields, it is difficult to
justify a scenario for their creation. If the compact object is a black hole,
the problem is more difficult since, according to general relativity it has ""no
hair"" (i.e., no magnetic field). Schuster, Blackett, Pauli, and others have
suggested that a rotating neutral body can create a magnetic field by
non-minimal gravitational-electromagnetic coupling (NMGEC). The
Schuster-Blackett form of NMGEC was obtained from the Mikhail and Wanas's
tetrad theory of gravitation (MW). We call the general theory NMGEC-MW.
  We investigate here the possible origin of the intense magnetic fields $\sim
10^{15}-10^{16}$ G in GRBs by NMGEC-MW. Whereas these fields are difficult to
explain astrophysically, we find that they are easily explained by NMGEC-MW. It

sheet significantly narrows when fully saturated with hydrogen. Furthermore,
the band gap of the BN sheet can be tuned from 4.7 eV to 0.6 eV and the system
can be a direct or an indirect semiconductor or even a half-metal depending
upon surface coverage. (2) Unlike graphene, BN sheet has hetero-atomic
composition, when co-decorated with H and F, it can lead to anisotropic
structures with rich electronic and magnetic properties. (3) Unlike graphene,
BN sheets can be made ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, or magnetically
degenerate depending upon how the surface is functionalized. (4) The stability
of magnetic coupling of functionalized BN sheet can be further modulated by
applying external strain. Our study highlights the potential of functionalized

nonlinear frequency shift, group velocity and collionless damping rate, $\nu$,
of a driven electron plasma wave (EPW). All these quantities, whose physical
content will be discussed, are identified as terms of an envelope equation
allowing one to predict how efficiently an EPW may be externally driven. This
envelope equation is derived directly from Gauss law and from the investigation
of the nonlinear electron motion, provided that the time and space rates of
variation of the EPW amplitude, $E_p$, are small compared to the plasma
frequency or the inverse of the Debye length. $\nu$ arises within the EPW
envelope equation as more complicated an operator than a plain damping rate,
and may only be viewed as such because $(\nu E_p)/E_p$ remains nearly constant
before abruptly dropping to zero. We provide a practical analytic formula for
$\nu$ and show, without resorting to complex contour deformation, that in the
limit $E_p \to 0$, $\nu$ is nothing but the Landau damping rate. We then term
$\nu$ the ""nonlinear Landau damping rate"" of the driven plasma wave. As for the
nonlinear frequency shift of the EPW, it is also derived theoretically and
found to assume values significantly different from previously published ones,
assuming that the wave is freely propagating. Moreover, we find no limitation
in $k \lambda_D$, $k$ being the plasma wavenumber and $\lambda_D$ the Debye
length, for a solution to the dispertion relation to exist, and want to stress
here the importance of specifying how an EPW is generated to discuss its
properties. Our theoretical predictions are in excellent agreement with results
inferred from Vlasov simulations of stimulated Raman scattering (SRS), and an
application of our theory to the study of SRS is presented.

a newly born magnetar could be the central object of some GRBs. The observed
luminosity and duration of the plateaus suggest that, for such a magnetar, a
rapid spin with a sub- or millisecond period is sometimes able to last
thousands of seconds. In this case, the conventional neutron star (NS) model
for the magnetar may be challenged, since the rapid spin of nascent NSs would
be remarkably decelerated within hundreds of seconds due to r-mode instability.
In contrast, the r-modes can be effectively suppressed in nascent strange stars
(SSs). In other words, to a certain extent, only SSs can keep nearly-constant
extremely-rapid spin for a long period of time during the early ages of the
stars. We thus propose that the sample of the GRB rapidly-spinning magnetars

evolution, and allowing for a larger, more realistic, number of stars than was
previously possible with direct N-body methods. We compare our results to other
N-body and Fokker-Planck simulations published previously. We find, in general,
very good agreement for the overall cluster structure and dynamical evolution
between direct N-body simulations and our Monte Carlo simulations. Significant
differences exist in the number of stars that are tidally disrupted by the
IMBH, which is most likely an effect of the wandering motion of the IMBH, not
included in the Monte Carlo scheme. These differences, however, are negligible
for the final IMBH masses in realistic cluster models as the disruption rates
are generally much lower than for single-mass clusters. As a direct comparison
to observations we construct a detailed model for the cluster NGC 5694, which
is known to possess a central surface brightness cusp consistent with the
presence of an IMBH. We find that not only the inner slope but also the outer

Here, hyperKahler manifolds have sp(2) holonomy in general and are dual to Type
IIB (p,q)5-brane configurations. On the other hand, Calabi-Yau fourfolds are
toric varieties expressed as quotient spaces. Our model involving fourfolds is
different from the usual one which is directly related to a symplectic quotient
procedure. Remarkable features in newly-found three-dimensional
Chern-Simons-matter theories appear here as well, such as dynamical
Fayet-Iliopoulos parameters, one dualized photon and its residual discrete

remarkable system HD69830 (Lovis et al. 2006) with three Neptune analogues,
raises difficult questions about current formation models which may require a
global treatment of the protoplanetary disc. Several formation scenarios have
been proposed, where most combine the canonical oligarchic picture of core
accretion with type I migration (e.g. Terquem & Papaloizou 2007) and planetary
atmosphere physics (e.g. Alibert et al. 2006). To date, published studies have
considered only a small number of progenitors at late times. This leaves
unaddressed important questions about the global viability of the models. We
seek to determine whether the most natural model -- namely, taking the
canonical oligarchic picture of core accretion and introducing type I migration
-- can succeed in forming objects of 10 Earth masses and more in the innermost
parts of the disc. This problem is investigated using both traditional
semianalytic methods for modelling oligarchic growth as well as a new parallel
multi-zone N-body code designed specifically for treating planetary formation
problems with large dynamic range (McNeil & Nelson 2009). We find that it is
extremely difficult for oligarchic tidal migration models to reproduce the
observed distribution. Even under many variations of the typical parameters, we
form no objects of mass greater than 8 Earth masses. By comparison, it is
relatively straightforward to form icy super-Earths. We conclude that either
the initial conditions of the protoplanetary discs in short-period Neptune
systems were substantially different from the standard disc models we used, or
there is important physics yet to be understood.

of A that must be changed to ensure that the rank of the altered matrix is at
most r. Since its introduction by Valiant (1977), rigidity and similar
rank-robustness functions of matrices have found numerous applications in
circuit complexity, communication complexity, and learning complexity. Almost
all nxn matrices over an infinite field have a rigidity of (n-r)^2. It is a
long-standing open question to construct infinite families of explicit matrices
even with superlinear rigidity when r = Omega(n).
  In this paper, we construct an infinite family of complex matrices with the
largest possible, i.e., (n-r)^2, rigidity. The entries of an n x n matrix in
this family are distinct primitive roots of unity of orders roughly exp(n^2 log
n). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first family of concrete (but not
entirely explicit) matrices having maximal rigidity and a succinct algebraic
description.
  Our construction is based on elimination theory of polynomial ideals. In
particular, we use results on the existence of polynomials in elimination
ideals with effective degree upper bounds (effective Nullstellensatz). Using
elementary algebraic geometry, we prove that the dimension of the affine
variety of matrices of rigidity at most k is exactly n^2-(n-r)^2+k. Finally, we
use elimination theory to examine whether the rigidity function is
semi-continuous.

are in a short-lived evolutionary phase of quasar population. We detected 20

greater than 10^5 K, which presumably come from nonthermal jets. Hence, BAL
outflows and nonthermal jets can be generated simultaneously in these central
engines. We also found four inverted-spectrum sources, which are interpreted as
Doppler-beamed, pole-on-viewed relativistic jet sources or young radio sources:
single edge-on geometry cannot describe all BAL quasars. We discuss the
implications of the OCTAVE observations for investigations for the orientation

using a Fourier transform profilometry technique, the deformation field of the
plate surface is measured simultaneously in time and space. This enables us to
compute the wavevector-frequency Fourier ($\mathbf k, \omega$) spectrum of the
full space-time deformation velocity. In the 3D ($\mathbf k, \omega$) space, we
show that the energy of the motion is concentrated on a 2D surface that
represents a nonlinear dispersion relation. This nonlinear dispersion relation
is close to the linear dispersion relation. This validates the usual
wavenumber-frequency change of variables used in many experimental studies of
wave turbulence. The deviation from the linear dispersion, which increases with
the input power of the forcing, is attributed to weak non linear effects. Our
technique opens the way for many new extensive quantitative comparisons between
theory and experiments of wave turbulence.

interesting physics due to the presence of exchange anisotropy. An infinite
order Kosterliz-Thouless-Berezinskii transition is replaced by second order XY
transition even an infinitesimal a small anisotropy in exchange coupling is
introduced. We predict a quantum phase transition between Mott insulating and
photonic superfluid phase due to detuning between the cavity and laser
frequency, a large detuning favours the photonic superfluid phase. We also do
the analysis of Jaynes and Cumming Hamiltonian to support results of quantum
field theoretical study.

high-energy astrophysics. It is well known that massive black holes in active
galaxies can release a substantial fraction of their accretion power into
energetic particles, producing gamma-rays and relativistic jets. Galactic
microquasars (hosting a compact star of 1-10 solar masses which accretes matter
from a binary companion) also produce relativistic jets. However, no direct
evidence of particle acceleration above GeV energies has ever been obtained in
microquasar ejections, leaving open the issue of the occurrence and timing of
extreme matter energization during jet formation. Here we report the detection
of transient gamma-ray emission above 100 MeV from the microquasar Cygnus X-3,
an exceptional X-ray binary which sporadically produces powerful radio jets.
Four gamma-ray flares (each lasting 1-2 days) were detected by the AGILE
satellite simultaneously with special spectral states of Cygnus X-3 during the
period mid-2007/mid-2009. Our observations show that very efficient particle
acceleration and gamma-ray propagation out of the inner disk of a microquasar
usually occur a few days before major relativistic jet ejections. Flaring
particle energies can be thousands of times larger than previously detected
maximum values (with Lorentz factors of 105 and 102 for electrons and protons,
respectively). We show that the transitional nature of gamma-ray flares and
particle acceleration above GeV energies in Cygnus X-3 is clearly linked to
special radio/X-ray states preceding strong radio flares. Thus gamma-rays
provide unique insight into the nature of physical processes in microquasars.

well suited to describe the system. The crossover between the two regimes is
smooth where the step structure between the Landau level edges turn into
Friedel oscillations. Increasing the temperature causes the step structure or

and timing properties of 14 nearby AGN. For 11 of the sources in the sample, we
used all the available data from the RXTE archive, which were taken until the
end of 2006. There are 7795 RXTE observations in total for these AGN, obtained
over a period of ~7-11 years. We extracted their 3-20 keV spectra and fitted
them with a simple power-law model, modified by the presence of a Gaussian line
(at 6.4 keV) and cold absorption, when necessary. We used these best-fit slopes
to estimate the mean spectral slope for each object, while we used results from
the literature to estimate the average spectral slope of the three objects
without archival, monitorin RXTE data. Our results show that the AGN average
spectral slopes are not correlated either with the black hole mass or the
characteristic frequencies that were detected in the power spectra.They are
positively correlated, though, with the characteristic frequency when
normalised to the sources black hole mass. This is similar to the
spectral-timing correlation that has been observed in Cyg X-1, but not the
same.The AGN spectral-timing correlation can be explained if we assume that the
accretion rate determines both the average spectral slope and the
characteristic time scales in AGN. The spectrum should steepen and the
characteristic frequency should increase, proportionally, with increasing
accretion rate. We also provide a quantitative expression between spectral
slope and accretion rate. Thermal Comptonisation models are broadly consistent
with our result, but only if the ratio of the soft photons' luminosity to the
power injected to the hot corona is proportionally related to the accretion
rate.

analyzing the reducibility of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem.
With such diverse uses, understanding these objects is important for anyone

an audience with a knowledge of the basic theory of elliptic curves, provides
an introduction to the necessary theoretical background for understanding what

to explain some of the basic computational tasks associated with isogenies.
Herein, algorithms for computing isogenies are collected and presented with
proofs of correctness and complexity analyses. As opposed to the complex

paper are primarily algebraic in nature. This provides alternate explanations
that some with a more concrete or computational bias may find more clear.

stellar mass function with redshift is considered and compared to the
assumptions of a passive evolution scenario. We draw attention to several
sources of systematic error that could bias the evolutionary predictions made
in this paper. While the inferred evolution is found to be relatively
unaffected by the exact choice of spectral evolution model used to compute K+e
corrections, we conclude that photometric errors could be a source of
significant bias in colour-selected samples such as this, in particular when
using parametric maximum likelihood based estimators. We find that the
evolution of the most massive LRGs is consistent with the assumptions of
passive evolution and that the stellar mass assembly of the LRGs is largely
complete by z ~ 0.8. Our findings suggest that massive galaxies with stellar
masses above 10^11 solar masses must have undergone merging and star formation
processes at a very early stage (z > 1). This supports the emerging picture of
downsizing in both the star formation as well as the mass assembly of early
type galaxies. Given that our spectroscopic sample covers an unprecedentedly
large volume and probes the most massive end of the galaxy mass function, we
find that these observational results present a significant challenge for many

a noiseless channel, Alice and Bob get a total of 0.573 key bits per trine
state sent (98% of the Shannon limit). This exceeds by a considerable amount
the yield of standard trine schemes, which ideally attain half a key bit per
trine state. Eavesdropping introduces an $\epsilon$-fraction of unbiased noise,
ensured by twirling if necessary. The security analysis reveals an asymmetry in
Eve's conditioned ancillas for Alice and Bob resulting from their inequivalent

If matter spreads throughout the interior of a supermassive black hole with

arise from a Bose-Einstein condensate of densely packed H-atoms. Within the
Relativistic Theory of Gravitation with a positive cosmological constant, a
bosonic quantum field describing H atoms is coupled to the curvature scalar
with dimensionless coupling $\xi$. In the Bose-Einstein condensed groundstate
an exact, self-consistent solution for the metric occurs for a certain large

is set by proper choice of the background metric as a first step of a

sense that all morphisms have kernels/cokernels, and possesses a symmetric
monoidal structure akin to direct sum. The Ringel-Hall algebra of $\C_{\F}$ is
isomorphic to the incidence Hopf algebra of the collection $\P(\F)$ of order
ideals of posets in $\F$. This construction generalizes the categories
introduced by K. Kremnizer and the author In the case when $\F$ is the
collection of posets coming from rooted forests or Feynman graphs.

does not have a direct physical meaning since arbitrary real numbers are not
observable. There are classical uncertainty relations, i.e. the uncertainty
(errors of observation) in the determination of coordinate and momentum is
always positive (non zero).
  A ""functional"" formulation of classical mechanics was suggested. The
fundamental equation of the microscopic dynamics in the functional approach is
not the Newton equation but the Liouville equation for the distribution
function of the single particle. Solutions of the Liouville equation have the
property of delocalization which accounts for irreversibility. The Newton
equation in this approach appears as an approximate equation describing the
dynamics of the average values of the position and momenta for not too long
time intervals. Corrections to the Newton trajectories are computed. An
interpretation of quantum mechanics is attempted in which both classical and
quantum mechanics contain fundamental randomness. Instead of an ensemble of
events one introduces an ensemble of observers.

is confined to thin flux ropes advected by a multi-scale flow which models
turbulence. Magnetic dissipation occurs only via reconnections of flux ropes.
The model is particularly suitable for rarefied plasma, such as the Solar
corona or galactic halos. We investigate the kinetic energy release into heat,
mediated by dynamo action, both in our model and by solving the induction
equation with the same flow. We find that the flux rope dynamo is more than an
order of magnitude more efficient at converting mechanical energy into heat.
The probability density of the magnetic energy released during reconnections
has a power-law form with the slope -3, consistent with the Solar corona
heating by nanoflares. We also present a nonlinear extension of the model. This
shows that a plausible saturation mechanism of the fluctuation dynamo is the
suppression of turbulent magnetic diffusivity, due to suppression of random
stretching at the location of the flux ropes. We confirm that the probability
distribution function of the magnetic line curvature has a power-law form
suggested by (Schekochihin et al., 2002). We argue, however, using our results
that this does not imply a persistent folded structure of magnetic field, at
least in the nonlinear stage.

  We consider a similar model based on relations whose input values are finite
sequences rather than sets. This alteration means that we are taking into
account the order in which observations are made. This new notion of graph
gives rise to a model of affine lambda-calculus that admits an interpretation
of imperative constructs including variable assignment, dereferencing and
allocation.
  Extending this untyped model, we construct a category that provides a model
of typed higher-order imperative computation with an affine type system. An
appropriate language of this kind is Reynolds's Syntactic Control of
Interference. Our model turns out to be fully abstract for this language. At a
concrete level, it is the same as Reddy's object spaces model, which was the
first ""state-free"" model of a higher-order imperative programming language and
an important precursor of games models. The graph model can therefore be seen
as a universal domain for Reddy's model.
