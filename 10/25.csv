which show that they are sharp in some well-posedness thresholds. Particularly,
we obtain the local well-posedness for the initial data in
$H^{-{3/16}+}(\R)\times H^{-{3/4}+}(\R)$ in the resonant case, it is almost the
optimal except the endpoint. At last we establish the global well-posedness
results in $H^s(\R)\times H^s(\R)$ when $s>\dfrac{1}{2}$ no matter in the
resonant case or in the non-resonant case, which improve the results of Pecher

Many realizations of equivalent initial conditions are used to produce robust

close encounter distances and velocities. These cluster properties are
presented as a function of parameters describing the initial configuration of
the cluster, including the initial cluster membership N, initial stellar

polarization from the noisy and discretized maps of Stokes parameter $Q$ and
$U$ in a finite area. A key step of the algorithm is to take a wavelet-Galerkin
discretization of the differential relation between the $E$, $B$ and $Q$, $U$
fields. This discretization allows derivative operator to be represented by a
matrix, which is exactly diagonal in scale space, and narrowly banded in
spatial space. We show that the effect of boundary can be eliminated by
dropping a few DWT modes located on or nearby the boundary. This method reveals
that the derivative operators will cause large errors in the $E$ and $B$ power
spectra on small scales if the $Q$ and $U$ maps contain Gaussian noise. It also
reveals that if the $Q$ and $U$ maps are random, these fields lead to the
mixing of the $E$ and $B$ modes. Consequently, the $B$ mode will be
contaminated if the powers of $E$ modes are much larger than that of $B$ modes.
Nevertheless, numerical tests show that the power spectra of both $E$ and $B$
on scales larger than the finest scale by a factor of 4 and higher can
reasonably be recovered, even when the power ratio of $E$- to $B$-modes is as
large as about 10$^2$, and the signal-to-noise ratio is equal to 10 and higher.
This is because the Galerkin discretization is free of false correlations, and
keeps the contamination under control. As wavelet variables contain information
of both spatial and scale spaces, the developed method is also effective to
recover the spatial structures of the $E$ and $B$ mode fields.

This relationship has been established through a ""homotopy-like"" coefficient
$\lambda$ which bridges continuously between the two systems. That is, for
$\lambda=1$ one obtains the full nonlinear model, and the corresponding linear
advection model is achieved for $\lambda=0$. In this paper, we investigate the
validity of this assertion for certain stochastic phenomenological shell models

existence of a finite-dimensional random attractor for each value of $\lambda$

argument. Our study aims toward the development of basic results and techniques

This effect is demonstrated via the gate fidelity control landscape of a system
whose controllability is restricted on a SU(2) dynamic symmetry group. We show
that multiple local false traps (i.e., non-global suboptima) exist even if the
target gate is realizable and that the number of these traps is increased by
the loss of controllability, while the controllable systems are always devoid

  This thesis first presents the pulsar timing campaign for the LAT, in
collaboration with large radiotelescopes and X-ray telescopes, allowing for
high sensitivity pulsed searches. Furthermore, it lead to quasi-homogeneous
coverage of the galactic MSPs, so that the search for pulsations in LAT data

  We present a search for pulsations from these objects in LAT data. For the
first time, eight galactic MSPs have been detected as sources of pulsed
$\gamma$-ray emission over 100 MeV. In addition, a couple of good candidates
for future detection are seen. A similar search for globular cluster MSPs has
not succeeded so far. Comparison of the phase-aligned $\gamma$-ray and radio

their $\gamma$-ray emission is similar to that of normal pulsars, and is
probably produced in the outer-magnetosphere. This discovery suggests that many
unresolved $\gamma$-ray sources are unknown MSPs.

&Planck is over 3 times tighter than using Planck alone, as DES breaks the

harmonics up to 300, averaged in bin of 10 to mimic the DES sky coverage. The
results are similar if we supplement DES bands (grizY) with the VISTA

uncertainties in non-linear fluctuations and redshift distortions. However, the
result is sensitive to the assumed galaxy biasing schemes and it requires
accurate prior knowledge of the biasing. To summarize, if the total neutrino

operation with the current pointing error model. We then focus on the upcoming
13-element expansion with its potential difficulties and solutions.
Photogrammetry measurements of the platform reveal deformations at a level
which can affect the optical pointing and the receiver radio phase. In order to
prepare for the 13-element upgrade, two optical telescopes are installed on the
platform to correlate optical pointing tests. Being mounted on different
locations, the residuals of the two sets of pointing errors show a
characteristic phase and amplitude difference as a function of the platform
deformation pattern. These results depend on the telescope's azimuth, elevation
and polarization position. An analytical model for the deformation is derived
in order to separate the local deformation induced error from the real hexapod
pointing error. Similarly, we demonstrate that the deformation induced radio
phase error can be reliably modeled and calibrated, which allows us to recover
the ideal synthesized beam in amplitude and shape of up to 90% or more. The
resulting array efficiency and its limits are discussed based on the derived
errors.

planetesimal belts identify debris disks with hot dust at 1AU, like eta Corvi
and HD69830, as anomalous since collisional processing should have removed most
of the planetesimal mass over their >1 Gyr lifetimes. This paper looks at the
effect of large planetesimal eccentricities (e>>0.3) on their collisional
lifetime and the amount of mass that can remain at late times M_{late}. For an
axisymmetric planetesimal disk with common pericentres and eccentricities e, we
find that M_{late} \propto e^{-5/3}(1+e)^{4/3}(1-e)^{-3}. For a scattered
disk-like population (i.e., common pericentres), in the absence of dynamical
evolution, the mass evolution at late times would be as if only planetesimals
with the largest eccentricity were present. Despite the increased remaining
mass, higher eccentricities do not increase the hot emission from the
collisional cascade until e>0.99, partly because most collisions occur near
pericentre thus increasing the dust blow-out diameter. However, at high
eccentricities (e>0.97) the blow-out population extending out from pericentre
may be detectable above the collisional cascade; higher eccentricities also
increase the probability of witnessing a recent collision. All of the imaging
and spectroscopic constraints for eta Corvi can be explained with a single
planetesimal population with pericentre at 0.75AU, apocentre at 150AU, and mass
5M_\oplus; however, the origin of such a high eccentricity population remains
challenging. The mid-IR excess to HD69830 can be explained by the ongoing
destruction of a debris belt produced in a recent collision in an eccentric
planetesimal belt, but the lack of far-IR emission requires small bound grains
to be absent from the parent planetesimal belt, possibly due to sublimation.

is investigated by linear analysis. Our own time-dependent, self-similar
solutions describing a dynamical condensing radiative gas layer are used as an
unperturbed state. We consider perturbations that are both perpendicular and
parallel to the direction of condensation. The transverse wave number of the
perturbation is defined by $k$. For $k=0$, it is found that the condensing gas
layer is unstable. However, the growth rate is too low to become nonlinear
during dynamical condensation. For $k\ne0$, in general, perturbation equations
for constant wave number cannot be reduced to an eigenvalue problem due to the
unsteady unperturbed state. Therefore, direct numerical integration of the
perturbation equations is performed. For comparison, an eigenvalue problem
neglecting the time evolution of the unperturbed state is also solved and both
results agree well. The gas layer is unstable for all wave numbers, and the
growth rate depends a little on wave number. The behaviour of the perturbation
is specified by $kL_\mathrm{cool}$ at the centre, where the cooling length,
$L_\mathrm{cool}$, represents the length that a sound wave can travel during
the cooling time. For $kL_\mathrm{cool}\gg1$, the perturbation grows
isobarically.
  For $kL_\mathrm{cool}\ll1$, the perturbation grows because each part has a
different collapse time without interaction. Since the growth rate is
sufficiently high, it is not long before the perturbations become nonlinear
during the dynamical condensation. Therefore, according to the linear analysis,
the cooling layer is expected to split into fragments with various scales.

calibration of the metallicity sensitivity of stellar isochrones in the gri

internal errors of in [Fe/H] ~ +/- 0.1 dex can be achieved for bulk stellar

decade, reputedly as a result of employing 3D hydrodynamical simulations to
model the inhomogeneous structure of the solar photosphere. The very low oxygen
abundance advocated by Asplund et al. (2004), A(O)=8.66, together with the
downward revision of the carbon and nitrogen abundances, has created serious
problems for solar models to explain the helioseismic measurements. In an
effort to contribute to the dispute we have re-derived photospheric abundances
of several elements independently of previous analysis. We applied a
state-of-the art 3D (CO5BOLD) hydrodynamical simulation of the solar
granulation as well as different 1D model atmospheres for the line by line
spectroscopic abundance determinations. The analysis is based on both standard
disc-centre and disc-integrated spectral atlases; for oxygen we acquired in
addition spectra at different heliocentric angles. The derived abundances are
the result of equivalent width and/or line profile fitting of the available
atomic lines. We discuss the different granulation effects on solar abundances
and compare our results with previous investigations. According to our
investigations hydrodynamical models are important in the solar abundance
determination, but are not responsible for the recent downward revision in the
literature of the solar metallicity.

Galactic Exploration and Understanding, executed as part of SDSS-II, obtained
some 3500 square degrees of additional ugriz imaging, mostly at lower Galactic
latitudes, in order to better sample the disk systems of the Galaxy. Most
importantly, it obtained over 240,000 medium-resolution spectra for stars
selected to sample Galactocentric distances from 0.5 to 100 kpc. In combination
with stellar targets from SDSS-I, and the recently completed SEGUE-2 program,
executed as part of SDSS-III, the total sample of SDSS spectroscopy for
Galactic stars comprises some 500,000 objects.
  The development of the SEGUE Stellar Parameter Pipeline has enabled the
determination of accurate atmospheric parameter estimates for a large fraction
of these stars. Many of the stars in this data set within 5 kpc of the Sun have
sufficiently well-measured proper motions to determine their full space
motions, permitting examination of the nature of much more distant populations
represented by members that are presently passing through the solar
neighborhood. Ongoing analyses of these data are being used to draw a much

This paper introduces the notion of correctness kernel of abstract

abstract values from them, in a maximal way while retaining exactly the same
approximate behavior of the system under analysis. We show that in abstract
model checking correctness kernels provide a simplification paradigm of the

simplification preserves spuriousness of examples (i.e., abstract paths). In
particular, we show how correctness kernels can be integrated with the

molecular extinction in horizontal remote sensing near the ground for several
visibilities at UV wavelengths by neglecting the spatial inhomogeneity of
aerosol in the atmosphere and taking into account the dependence of refracting
on air temperature and pressure. Due to weak attenuation of oxygen and other
gaseous atmospheric constituents in this region, we have only considered the
effect of ozone in calculation. The results are important to estimate
systematic errors in measuring gas concentration introduced by large wavelength
separation in UV-DIAL. The total attenuation (km-1) at wavelengths is listed in
the form of a table from 200 to 400 nm for several values of visibilities. It
is found the aerosol attenuation in UV region varies quite smoothly with
wavelength and therefore systematic error caused by aerosol scattering is
negligible in remote sensing by UV-DIAL even with large wavelength separation.
Moreover, it has been found that only aerosol extinction is dominant in lidar
remote sensing in the lower atmosphere in UV region. In large altitude that
aerosol concentration is lower; the molecular scattering is important
especially for wavelengths larger than 310 nm.
