constraints derived with the halo mass function and for understanding the
physical processes that govern the heating and cooling of the intracluster
medium. In this paper, we use a sample of 206 X-ray selected galaxy groups to
investigate the scaling relation between X-ray luminosity (Lx) and halo mass
(M00) where M200 is derived via stacked weak gravitational lensing. This work
draws upon a broad array of multi-wavelength COSMOS observations including 1.64
square degrees of contiguous imaging with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS)
and deep XMM-Newton/Chandra imaging. The combined depth of these two data-sets
allows us to probe the lensing signals of X-ray detected structures at both
higher redshifts and lower masses than previously explored. Weak lensing
profiles and halo masses are derived for nine sub-samples, narrowly binned in
luminosity and redshift. The COSMOS data alone are well fit by a power law,
M200 ~ Lx^a, with a slope of a=0.66+-0.14. These results significantly extend
the dynamic range for which the halo masses of X-ray selected structures have
been measured with weak gravitational lensing. As a result, tight constraints
are obtained for the slope of the M-Lx relation. The combination of our group
data with previously published cluster data demonstrates that the M-Lx relation
is well described by a single power law, a=0.64+-0.03, over two decades in
mass, 10^13.5-10^15.5 h72^-1 Msun. These results are inconsistent at the 3.7
level with the self-similar prediction of a=0.75. We examine the redshift
dependence of the M-Lx relation and find little evidence for evolution beyond
the rate predicted by self-similarity from z ~ 0.25 to z ~ 0.8.

with the non-relativistic field decomposition (NRG fields). For that purpose we
develop quite generally the dressing theory of a non-linear classical field
theory coupled to point-like sources. We introduce dressed charges and
propagators, but unlike the quantum theory there are no dressed bulk vertices.
The dressed quantities are found to obey recursive integral equations which
succinctly encode parts of the diagrammatic expansion, and are the classical
version of the Schwinger-Dyson equations. Actually, the classical equations are
somewhat stronger since they involve only finitely many quantities, unlike the
quantum theory. Classical diagrams are shown to factorize exactly when they
contain non-linear world-line vertices, and we classify all the possible
topologies of irreducible diagrams for low loop numbers. We apply the dressing
program to our Post-Newtonian case of interest. The dressed charges consist of
the dressed energy-momentum tensor after a non-relativistic decomposition, and
we compute all dressed charges (in the harmonic gauge) appearing up to 2PN in
the 2-body effective action (and more). We determine the irreducible skeleton
diagrams up to 3PN and we employ the dressed charges to compute several terms

without violation of Lorentz symmetry in arbitrary dimension. These theories
are well known to possess very unusual properties, unfamiliar from studies of
gauge and Lorentz invariant models. These peculiarities are caused by mixing of
familiar transverse fields with revived longitudinal and pure gauge
(Stueckelberg) fields and are all seen already in quadratic approximation. They
are all associated with non-trivial dispersion laws, which easily allow
superluminal propagation, ghosts, tachyons and essential irrationalities.
Moreover, coefficients in front of emerging modes are small, what makes the
theories essentially non-perturbative within a large Vainshtein radius.
Attempts to get rid of unwanted degrees of freedom by giving them infinite
masses lead to DVZ discontinuities in parameter (moduli) space, caused by
un-permutability of different limits. Also, the condition m_{gh}=\infty can not
be preserved already in non-trivial gravitational backgrounds and is unstable
under any other perturbations of linearized gravity. At the same time an {\it a
priori} healthy model of massive gravity in quadratic approximation definitely
exists: provided by any mass level of Kaluza-Klein tower. It bypasses the
problems because gravity field is mixed with other fields, and this explains
why such mixing helps in other models. At the same time this can imply that the
really healthy massive gravity can still require infinite number of extra
fields beyond quadratic approximation.

Emission was detected from eight galaxies, for which far-infrared luminosities,

derived. These galaxies have star formation rates and star formation
efficiencies comparable to other high redshift molecular emission line
galaxies. The results are used to test the idea that star formation in these
galaxies occurs in a large number of basic units, the units being similar to
star-forming clumps in the Milky Way. The luminosity of these extreme galaxies
can be reproduced in a simple model with (0.9-30) *10^6 dense clumps, each with
a luminosity of 5 *10^5 Lsun, the mean value for such clumps in the Milky Way.
Radiative transfer models of such clumps can provide reasonable matches to the
overall SEDs of the galaxies. They indicate that the individual clumps are
quite opaque in the far-infrared. Luminosity to mass ratios vary over two
orders of magnitude, correlating strongly with the dust temperature derived
from simple fits to the SED. The gas masses derived from the dust modeling are
in remarkable agreement with those from CO luminosities, suggesting that the
assumptions going into both calculations are reasonable.

Survey (EDisCS) fields. Photometric redshifts were computed using two
independent codes (Hyperz and G. Rudnick's code). The accuracy of photometric
redshifts was assessed by comparing our estimates with the spectroscopic
redshifts of ~1400 galaxies in the 0.3<z<1.0 domain. The accuracy for galaxies
fainter than the spectroscopic control sample was estimated using a degraded
version of the photometric catalog for the spectroscopic sample. The accuracy
of photometric redshifts is typically sigma(Delta z/(1+z)) ~ 0.05+/-0.01,
depending on the field, the filter set, and the spectral type of the galaxies.
The quality of the photometric redshifts degrades by a factor of two in
sigma(Delta z/(1+z)) between the brightest (I~22) and the faintest (I~24-24.5)
galaxies in the EDisCS sample. The photometric determination of cluster
redshifts in the EDisCS fields using a simple algorithm based on photoz is in
excellent agreement with the spectroscopic values (delta(z) ~0.03-0.04 in the
high-z sample and ~0.05 in the low-z sample). We also developed a method that
uses both photz codes jointly to reject interlopers at magnitudes fainter than
the spectroscopic limit. When applied to the spectroscopic sample, this method
rejects ~50-90% of all spectroscopically confirmed non-members, while retaining
at least 90% of all confirmed members. Photometric redshifts are found to be
particularly useful for the identification and study of clusters of galaxies in
large surveys. They enable efficient and complete pre-selection of cluster
members for spectroscopy, allow accurate determinations of the cluster
redshifts, and provide a means of determining cluster membership. (Abridged)

polarization effects for the production of baryons in the target fragmentation
region of deep-inelastic processes. These functions characterize transverse
momentum asymmetries related to the spin orientation for different flavors of
axial vector diquarks in an unpolarized ensemble of protons just as the
familiar Boer-Mulders functions characterize transverse momentum asymmetries
connected to the spin orientation of quarks in unpolarized targets. The
asymmetries of the fractured Boer-Mulders effect originating in the proton
distribution function can be separated kinematically, both in SIDIS and in the
Drell-Yan process from the asymmetries of the polarizing fracture functions
generated during the soft color rearrangement of the fragmentation process. The
experimental requirements for this separation are presented in this article and
it is shown that the fractured Boer-Mulders effect should change sign between
Drell-Yan and SIDIS while the polarizing fracture functions remain the same.
Simple isospin arguments indicate the two polarization mechanisms should give
significantly different results for the production of polarized lambdas and
sigmas.

introduced by Bautista (2008) that account for the effects of electron-electron

variational parameters of the potential. Additional calculations were carried
out with the Relativistic Hartree-Fock and the multiconfiguration Dirac-Fock
methods. Collision strengths in LS-coupling were calculated in the close
coupling approximation with the R-matrix method. Then, fine structure collision
strengths were obtained by means of the intermediate-coupling frame
transformation (ICFT) method which accounts for spin-orbit coupling effects.
Results. We present extensive comparisons between the results of different
approximations and with the most recent calculations and experiment available
in the literature. From these comparisons we derive a recommended set of gf-
values and radiative transition rates with their corresponding estimated
uncertainties. We also study the effects of different approximations in the
representation of the target ion on the electron-impact collision strengths.
Our most accurate set of collision strengths were integrated over a Maxwellian
distribution of electron energies and the resulting effective collision
strengths are given for a wide range of temperatures. Our results present
significant differences from recent calculations with the B-spline

approximation. When using this method in a material simulation, it is necessary
to compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian describing the
system. In general, the system possesses few explicit symmetries. Due to them,
the problem has many degenerate eigenvalues. The ambiguity in choosing a
orthonormal basis of the invariant subspaces, associated with degenerate
eigenvalues, will result in eigenvectors which are not invariant under the
action of the symmetry operators in matrix form. A meaningful computation of
the eigenvectors needs to take those symmetries into account. A natural choice
is a set of eigenvectors, which simultaneously diagonalizes the Hamiltonian and
the symmetry matrices. This is possible because all the matrices commute with
each other. The simultaneous eigenvectors and the corresponding eigenvalues
will be in a parametrized form in terms of the lattice momentum components.
This functional dependence of the eigenvalues is the dispersion relation and
describes the band structure of a material. Therefore it is important to find
this functional dependence in any numerical computation related to material

nightly basis. Collectively, these large images will contain billions of
interesting objects, which astronomers call sources. The astronomers' task is
to construct a catalog detailing the coordinates and other properties of the
sources. The source catalog is the primary data product for most telescopes and
is an important input for testing new astrophysical theories, but to construct
the catalog one must first detect the sources. Existing algorithms for catalog
creation are effective at detecting sources, but do not have rigorous
statistical error control. At the same time, there are several multiple testing
procedures that provide rigorous error control, but they are not designed to
detect sources that are aggregated over several pixels. In this paper, we
propose a technique that does both, by providing rigorous statistical error
control on the aggregate objects themselves rather than the pixels. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on data from the Chandra X-ray
Observatory Satellite. Our technique effectively controls the rate of false
sources, yet still detects almost all of the sources detected by procedures
that do not have such rigorous error control and have the advantage of
additional data in the form of follow up observations, which will not be
available for upcoming large telescopes. In fact, we even detect a new source
that was missed by previous studies. The statistical methods developed in this
paper can be extended to problems beyond Astronomy, as we will illustrate with
an example from Neuroimaging.

Dic_3. The quotient manifolds have chi=-6 and Hodge numbers (h^11,h^21)=(1,4).
With the standard embedding of the spin connection in the gauge group, Y gives
rise to an E_6 gauge theory with 3 chiral generations of particles. The gauge
group may be broken further by means of the Hosotani mechanism combined with
continuous deformation of the background gauge field. For the non-Abelian
quotient we obtain a model with 3 generations with the gauge group broken to
that of the standard model. Moreover there is a limit in which the quotients
develop 3 conifold points. These singularities may be resolved simultaneously
to give another manifold with (h^11,h^21)=(2,2) that lies right at the tip of
the distribution of Calabi-Yau manifolds. This strongly suggests that there is
a heterotic vacuum for this manifold that derives from the 3 generation model
on the quotient of Y. The manifold Y may also be realised as a hypersurface in
the toric variety. The symmetry group does not act torically, nevertheless we
are able to identify the mirror of the quotient manifold by adapting the

Joyce to obtain four dimensional local models for scalar-flat Kahler metrics

Taub-NUT metric by including it in a new family of complete scalar-flat toric
Kahler metrics. In this paper we generalize Donaldson's method and construct
complete scalar-flat toric Kahler metrics on any symplectic toric 4-manifold
with ""strictly unbounded"" moment polygon. These include the asymptotic locally
Euclidean scalar-flat Kahler metrics previously constructed by Calderbank and
Singer, as well as new examples of complete scalar-flat toric Kahler metrics
which are asymptotic to Donaldson's generalized Taub-NUT metrics. Our
construction is in symplectic action-angle coordinates and determines all these
metrics via their symplectic potentials. When the first Chern class is zero we
obtain a new description of known Ricci-flat Kahler metrics.

phenomenological traits. A transition is generally observed from a
time-homogeneous dynamical regime to an aging regime where physical changes
occur intermittently and, on average, at a decreasing rate. It has been
suggested that a global change of the independent time variable to its
logarithm may render the aging dynamics homogeneous: for colloids, this entails
diffusion but on a logarithmic time scale. Our novel analysis of experimental
colloid data confirms that the mean square displacement grows linearly in time
at low densities and shows that it grows linearly in the logarithm of time at
high densities. Correspondingly, pairs of particles initially in close contact
survive as pairs with a probability which decays exponentially in either time
or its logarithm. The form of the Probability Density Function of the
displacements shows that long-ranged spatial correlations are very long-lived
in dense colloids. A phenomenological stochastic model is then introduced which
relies on the growth and collapse of strongly correlated clusters (""dynamic
heterogeneity""), and which reproduces the full spectrum of observed colloidal
behaviors depending on the form assumed for the probability that a cluster
collapses during a Monte Carlo update. In the limit where large clusters
dominate, the collapse rate is ~1/t, implying a homogeneous, log-Poissonian
process that qualitatively reproduces the experimental results for dense
colloids. Finally an analytical toy-model is discussed to elucidate the strong
dependence of the simulation results on the integrability (or lack thereof) of
the cluster collapse probability function.

by other work as young clusters. We distinguish between these, and old
clusters, in the final classifications. Our final catalogue includes 416 old
clusters, 156 young clusters and 373 candidate clusters. We also investigate
the structure of M31's old GCs using previously published King model fits to
these WFCAM images. We demonstrate that the structure and colours of M31's old

a 12CO (2-1) and 13CO (2-1) mapping survey of these cores with the Heinrich

We derive molecular masses for the cores and the surrounding environment; we
find that the 24 micron shadow masses are always greater than or equal to the
molecular masses derived in the same region, a discrepancy likely caused by CO
freeze--out onto dust grains. We combine this sample with two additional cores
that we studied previously to bring the total sample to 14 cores. Using a
simple Jeans mass criterion we find that ~ 2/3 of the cores selected to have
prominent 24 micron shadows are collapsing or near collapse, a result that is
supported by millimeter line observations. Of this subset at least half have
indications of 70 micron shadows. All cores observed to produce absorption
features at 70 micron are close to collapse. We conclude that 24 micron
shadows, and even more so the 70 micron ones, are useful markers of cloud cores

dynamic magnetism characterized by a single correlation time with a temperature
independent fluctuation rate. We observed that this low temperature fluctuation
rate increases with x up to 0.08, above which it levels off. The 300mK energy
scale corresponds to the Ho3+ hyperfine interaction strength, suggesting that
the hyperfine interaction may be intimately involved with the spin dynamics in
this system.

specific to a rapid cooling of the core. To calculate the specific heat of
inner crust baryonic matter, i.e., nuclear clusters and unbound neutrons, we
use the quasiparticle spectrum provided by the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approach
at finite temperature. In this framework we analyse the dependence of the crust
thermalisation on pairing properties and on cluster structure of inner crust
matter. It is shown that the pairing correlations reduce the crust
thermalisation time by a very large fraction. The calculations show also that
the nuclear clusters have a non-negligible influence on the time evolution of
the surface temperature of the neutron star.

allows to recover a process of class Sigma from its final value and the last
time it visited the origin. In many situations this gives access to the
distribution of the last time a stochastic process hit a certain level or was
equal to its running maximum. It also leads to a formula recently discovered by
Madan, Roynette and Yor expressing put option prices in terms of last passage

of certain functionals of processes of class Sigma, and the third one gives a
formula for their conditional expectations. From the latter one can deduce the
laws of a variety of interesting random variables such as running maxima,
drawdowns and maximum drawdowns of suitably stopped processes. As an
application we discuss the pricing and hedging of options that depend on the
running maximum of an underlying price process and are triggered when the
underlying price drops to a given level or alternatively, when the drawdown or

variety of patterns with potential ordering of charges, spins, and orbitals,
which are believed to be closely connected to many novel properties of these
materials including superconductivity, metal-insulator transitions, and the CMR
effect. How these real-space patterns affect the conductivity and other
properties of materials (which are usually described in momentum space) is one
of the major challenges of modern condensed matter physics. Moreover, although
the presence of static stripes is indisputable, the existence (and potential
impacts) of fluctuating stripes in such compounds is a subject of great debate.
Here we present the electronic excitations of
La$_{2-2x}$Sr$_{1+2x}$Mn$_{2}$O$_{7}$ (x ~ 0.59) probed by angle-resolved
photoemission (ARPES), from which we demonstrate that a novel type of ordering,
termed bi-stripes, can exhibit either static or fluctuating order as a function
of temperature. We found that the static bi-stripe order is especially damaging
to electrical conductivity, completely localizing the electrons in the
bi-stripe regions, while the fluctuating stripes can coexist with mobile
carriers. This physics drives a novel phase transition with colossal
conductivity changes as a function of temperature. Our finding suggests that
quantum stripes can give rise to electronic properties significantly different
from their static counterparts. Inducing transition between them can turn on
remarkable electronic phenomena, enriching our understanding of correlated
electron systems as well as opening a window for potential applications in
electronic devices.

Would this be the case, the scalars would leave long enough to interact and

take place with a mediation of the dense parton medium through which they
propagate. Since multiple processes would have to be included, the latter case
is too convoluted to be treated with perturbative methods applied to the
Standard Model. We explore a possibility of describing such interaction by a
nonlocal Lagrangian which is an infinite polynomial in the field variables,
momentum and mass. We treat all scalars as identical, use a O(N)-symmetric
Lagrangian, where N is the number of scalars and discuss the problem in 1/N

requires only a limited set of multiplicative renormalizations, provided that
the parameters in the Lagrangian are not treated as an infinite set of

on an independently designed set of benchmarks, and on real networks, show the

curve is characterized by a broad peak around superior conjunction in agreement

law with an exponential cutoff, yielding an overall flux (100 MeV - 300 GeV) of

emission in type 2 sources, (2) shows broad, flat-topped emission peaks shifted
toward long wavelengths in several type 1 sources, and (3) is not seen in deep
absorption in any source observed so far. We solve all three puzzles with our
clumpy dust radiative transfer formalism. (1) We present the spectral energy
distribution (SED) of SST1721+6012, the first type 2 quasar observed to show a
clear 10-mic silicate feature in emission. We constructed a large database of
clumpy torus models and performed extensive fitting of the observed SED,
constraining several of the torus parameters. We find that the source
bolometric luminosity is ~3*10^12 L_sun. Our modeling suggests that <35% of
objects with tori sharing characteristics and geometry similar to the best fit
would have their central engines obscured. This relatively low obscuration
probability can explain the clear appearance of the 10-mic emission feature in
SST1721+6012 together with its rarity among other QSO2. (2) We also fitted the
SED of PG1211+143, one of the first type 1 QSOs with a 10-mic silicate feature
in emission. Among similar sources, this QSO appears to display an unusually
broadened feature whose peak is shifted toward longer wavelengths. Although
this led to suggestions of non-standard dust chemistry in these sources, our
analysis fits such SEDs with standard galactic dust; the apparent peak shifts
arise from radiative transfer effects. (3) We find that the distribution of
silicate feature strengths among clumpy torus models closely resembles the
observed distribution, and the feature never occurs deeply absorbed. (abridged)

(among some EOB parameters) which was left after using comparable-mass NR data
to constrain the EOB formalism. We suggest various ways of obtaining more

focussing on a special zero-binding zoom-whirl orbit. We show that logarithmic

localization, to establish the sensitivity of the estimation mean-square error
(MSE) to the level of phase synchronization mismatch in coherent Multiple-Input
Multiple-Output (MIMO) radar systems with widely distributed antennas. The
lower bound on the MSE is derived for the joint estimation of the vector of
unknown parameters, consisting of the target location and the mismatch of the
allegedly known system parameters, i.e., phase offsets at the radars.
Synchronization errors are modeled as being random and Gaussian. A closed-form
expression for the hybrid CRB is derived for the case of orthogonal
waveforms.The bound on the target localization MSE is expressed as the sum of
two terms - the first represents the CRB with no phase mismatch, and the second
captures the mismatch effect. The latter is shown to depend on the phase error
variance, the number of mismatched transmitting and receiving sensors and the
system geometry. For a given phase synchronization error variance, this
expression offers the means to analyze the achievable localization accuracy.
Alternatively, for a predetermined localization MSE target value, the derived
expression may be used to determine the necessary phase synchronization level
in the distributed system.

The fractional amplitude was 15% (rms). The dynamic power density spectrum for
each burst revealed an increase in frequency of approx. 1-2 Hz while the
oscillation was present. The frequency drift, the high significance of the
detections and the almost identical signal frequencies measured in two bursts

frequency in EXO 0748-676 is within a few Hz of 552 Hz, rather than 45 Hz as
was suggested from an earlier signal detection by Villarreal & Strohmayer
(2004). Consequently, Doppler broadening must significantly affect spectral
features arising from the neutron star surface, so that the narrow absorption
features previously reported from an XMM-Newton spectrum could not have arisen
there. The origin of both the previously reported 45 Hz oscillation and the

best studied roAp star, HD 24712, using the magnetic Doppler imaging (MDI)
code, INVERS10, which allows us to reconstruct simultaneously and consistently
the magnetic field geometry and elemental abundance distributions on a stellar
surface. For this purpose we analyse time series spectra obtained in Stokes I
and V parameters with the SOFIN polarimeter at the Nordic Optical Telescope and
recover surface abundance structures of sixteen different chemical elements,
respectively ions, including Mg, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd,
Gd, Tb, and Dy. For the rare earth elements (REE) Pr and Nd separate maps were
obtained using lines of the first and the second ionization stage.
  We find and confirm a clear dipolar structure of the surface magnetic field
and an unexpected correlation of elemental abundances with respect to this
field: one group of elements accumulates solely where the positive magnetic
pole is visible, whereas the other group avoids this region and is enhanced
where the magnetic equatorial region dominates the visible stellar surface. We
also observe relative shifts of abundance enhancement- or depletion regions
between the various elements exhibiting otherwise similar behaviour.

process of nonlocal Andreev reflection is predicted to lead to a negative
nonlocal resistance and positive current-current correlation. By

configurations for the legs. In effect, depending on the joint configurations
of the legs, a given configuration of the end-effector may or may not be free
of singularity and collision. Characterization of the
collision/singularity-free workspace is useful but may be insufficient since
two configurations can be accessible without collisions nor singularities but
it may not exist a feasible trajectory between them. The goal of this paper is
to define the maximal regions of the workspace where it is possible to execute
trajectories. Twodifferent families of regions are defined : 1. those regions
where the end-effector can move between any set of points, and 2. the regions
where any continuous path can be tracked. These regions are characterized from
the notion of aspects and free-aspects recently defined for parallel
manipulators [Chablat 1998b]. The construction of these regions is achieved by
enrichment techniques and using an extension of the octree structures to spaces
of dimension greater than three. Illustrative examples show the interest of
this study to the optimization of trajectories and the design of parallel

describe that sometimes a causal hypothesis must be rejected because

Turing's result regarding the undecidability of the halting problem as a result

present novel results concerning this autosolvability requirement. The analysis
is streamlined by using the notion of a functional unit, which is an abstract
state-based model of a machine. In the case where the behaviours exhibited by a
component of an execution environment can be viewed as the behaviours of a
machine in its different states, the behaviours concerned are completely
determined by a functional unit. The above-mentioned analysis involves
functional units whose possible states represent the possible contents of the
tapes of Turing machines with a particular tape alphabet. We also investigate
functional units whose possible states are the natural numbers. This
investigation yields a novel computability result, viz. the existence of a
universal computable functional unit for natural numbers.

The radial velocities and the optical light curves obtained by Hipparcos and

components have been found to be 1.65$\pm$0.09 and 0.99$\pm$0.05 M$_{\odot}$,
respectively. The cross-correlation functions indicate triple peaks which show
presence of a tertiary star. The spectroscopic properties of this additional
component resemble to that of the primary star. The analysis of the light
curves yielded that the more massive primary star fills its corresponding Roche
lobe. The secondary component is at or near Roche lobe indicating a new $\beta$
Lyrae-type near-contact binary. The orbital inclination is about 40$^{\circ}$
and, therefore, the observed light variations are produced only by the
proximity effects. Due to the absence of eclipses, the effective temperature of
the secondary star and the radii of the components could not be determined
accurately. We conclude that NP Aqr is a non-eclipsing double-lined
spectroscopic binary with a distance of about 134$\pm$7 pc. The absolute
parameters of the components are also compared with the evolutionary models.
While the location of the primary star seems to be suitable with respect to its
mass in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, the secondary component is located as
if a star having a mass less than 0.6 M$_{\odot}$. This discrepancy is
originated from very low effective temperature determined only from the light
curve produced by proximity effects. The distance to the third star appears to
be very close to that of the close binary which indicates that it may be
dynamically bounded to the binary.

development of the Drosophila central nervous system, neural stem cells called
neuroblasts sequentially express a group of genes in a definite order, which
generates the diversity of cell types. By producing all possible regulatory
networks of these genes and examining their expression dynamics numerically, we
identify requisite regulations and predict an unknown factor to reproduce known
expression profiles caused by loss-of-function or overexpression of the genes
in vivo, as well as in the wild type. We then evaluate the stability of the
actual Drosophila network for sequential expression. This network shows the
highest robustness against parameter variations and gene expression
fluctuations among the possible networks that reproduce the expression
profiles. We propose a regulatory module composed of three kinds of regulations
which is responsible for precise sequential expression. The present study

computation theory (t-QCT), where the computation time is defined by the
physical one and the Hamiltonian contains only one- and two-qubit interactions.
This version of t-QCT is also considered as optimality by sub-Riemannian
geodesic length. The work has two aims: one is to develop a t-QCT itself based
on physically natural concept of time, and the other is to pursue the
possibility of using t-QCT as a tool to estimate the complexity in conventional
gate-optimal quantum computation theory (g-QCT). In particular, we investigate
to what extent is true the statement: time complexity is polynomial in the
number of qubits if and only if so is gate complexity. In the analysis, we
relate t-QCT and optimal control theory (OCT) through fidelity-optimal
computation theory (f-QCT); f-QCT is equivalent to t-QCT in the limit of unit
optimal fidelity, while it is formally similar to OCT. We then develop an
efficient numerical scheme for f-QCT by modifying Krotov's method in OCT, which
has monotonic convergence property. We implemented the scheme and obtained
solutions of f-QCT and of t-QCT for the quantum Fourier transform and a unitary
operator that does not have an apparent symmetry. The former has a polynomial
gate complexity and the latter is expected to have exponential one because a
series of generic unitary operators has a exponential gate complexity. The time
complexity for the former is found to be linear in the number of qubits, which
is understood naturally by the existence of an upper bound. The time complexity
for the latter is exponential. Thus the both targets are examples satisfyng the
statement above. The typical characteristics of the optimal Hamiltonians are
symmetry under time-reversal and constancy of one-qubit operation, which are
mathematically shown to hold in fairly general situations.

underestimated the stellar mass of M31's bulge by a factor 2. Moreover, the
light-weighted velocity dispersion of the galaxy grows to 166 km/s, thus
reducing the discrepancy between the predicted and measured mass of the black
hole at the center of M31. The kinematic position angle varies with distance,
pointing to triaxiality. We detect gas counterrotation near the bulge minor

constant on circles. We derive the age, metallicity and alpha-element
overabundance profiles. Except for the region in the inner arcsecs of the
galaxy, the bulge of M31 is uniformly old (>12 Gyr, with many best-fit ages at
the model grid limit of 15 Gyr), slightly alpha-elements overabundant
([alpha/Fe]~0.2) and at solar metallicity, in agreement with studies of the

caused by interferometer and photon calibrator beam centering offsets, absolute
laser power measurement using temperature-controlled InGaAs photodetectors
mounted on integrating spheres and calibrated by NIST, minimizing errors
induced by localized elastic deformation of the mirror surface by using a
two-beam configuration with the photon calibrator beams symmetrically displaced
about the center of the optic, and simultaneously actuating the test mass with
voice coil actuators and the photon calibrator to minimize fluctuations caused

operate in the most sensitive interferometer configuration, and is expected to
become a primary calibration method for future gravitational wave searches.

we test whether the depletion pattern of refractory elements, seen in similar
Galactic sources, is also common for extragalactic sources. Since this
depletion process probably only occurs through interaction with a stable disc,
we investigate the circumstellar environment of these sources. Methods: A
detailed photospheric abundance study was performed using high-resolution UVES
optical spectra. To study the circumstellar environment we use photometric data
to construct the spectral energy distributions of the stars, and determine the
geometry of the circumstellar environment, whereas low-resolution Spitzer-IRS
infrared spectra are used to trace its mineralogy. Results: Our results show
that, also in the LMC, the photospheres of RV Tauri stars are commonly affected
by the depletion process, although it can differ significantly in strength from
source to source. From our detailed disc modelling and mineralogy study, we
find that this process, as in the Galaxy, appears closely related to the
presence of a stable Keplerian disc. The newly studied extragalactic objects
have similar observational characteristics as Galactic post-AGB binaries
surrounded by a dusty disc, and are therefore also believed to be part of a
binary system. One source shows a very small infrared excess, atypical for a
disc source, but still has evidence for depletion. We speculate this could
point to the presence of a very evolved disc, similar to debris discs seen
around young stellar objects.

distance does not increase indefinitely with redshift and that even the
farthest possible observable point may have a finite parallax angle, a factor
that needs to be carefully taken into account when using distant objects as the
background field against which the parallax of a foreground object is to be

case of two luminosity indicators and search the optimal luminosity-flux ratio
relations on a set of spectra whose phases are around not only the date of
bright light but also other time. With these relations, a new method is
proposed to constrain the host galaxy extinction of SN Ia and its distance. It
is first applied to the low redshift supernovas and then to the high redshift
ones. The results of the low redshift supernovas indicate that the flux ratio
method can indeed give well constraint on the host galaxy extinction parameter
E(B-V), but weaker constraints on R_{V}. The high redshift supernova spectra
are processed by the same method as the low redshift ones besides some
differences due to their high redshift. Among 16 high redshift supernovas, 15
are fitted very well except 03D1gt. Based on these distances, Hubble diagram is
drew and the contents of the Universe are analyzed. It supports an acceleration
behavior in the late Universe. Therefore, the flux ratio method can give
constraints on the host galaxy extinction and supernova distance independently.
We believe, through further studies, it may provide a precise tool to probe the
acceleration of the Universe than before.

quantum. We study intrinsic leakage effects, i.e., direct transitions from the
allowed qubit states to higher excited states of the system during the

asteroseismology. For practicality however, certain model assumptions are also
required. For example, in the case of subdwarf B stars, one usually starts with
zero-age horizontal branch structures without following the progenitor
evolution. We analyse the effects of common assumptions in subdwarf B models on
the g-mode pulsational properties. We investigate if and how the pulsation
periods are affected by the H-profile in the core-envelope transition zone.
Furthermore, the effects of C-production and convective mixing during the core
helium flash are evaluated. Finally, we reanalyse the effects of stellar
opacities on the mode excitation in subdwarf B stars. We find that helium
settling causes a shift in the theoretical blue edge of the g-mode instability
domain to higher effective temperatures. This results in a closer match to the
observed instability strip of long-period sdB pulsators, particularly for l<=3
modes. We show further that the g-mode spectrum is extremely sensitive to the
H-profile in the core-envelope transition zone. If atomic diffusion is
efficient, details of the initial shape of the profile become less important in
the course of evolution. Diffusion broadens the chemical gradients, and results
in less effective mode trapping and different pulsation periods. Furthermore,
we report on the possible consequences of the He-flash for the g-modes. The
outer edge of a flash-induced convective region introduces an additional
chemical transition in the stellar models, and the corresponding spike in the
Brunt-Vaisala frequency produces a complicated mode trapping signature in the
period spacings.

that the network is massively dense, i.e., there are so many sources,
destinations, and relay nodes, that it is best to describe the network in terms

of microscopic parameters, such as their individual placements.
  We focus on a particular physical layer model that is characterized by the
following assumptions: i) the nodes must only transport the data from the
sources to the destinations, and do not need to sense the data at the sources,
or deliver them at the destinations once the data arrive at their physical
locations, and ii) the nodes have limited bandwidth available to them, but they
use it optimally to locally achieve the network capacity.

Spitzer surveys in the VVDS-SWIRE and GOODS areas. To our limiting flux of
S(24)=400microJy our derived sample in VVDS-SWIRE includes 1494 sources, and
666 and 904 sources brighter than S(24)=80microJy are catalogued in GOODS-S and
GOODS-N, respectively, for a total area of ~0.9 square degs. We obtain reliable
optical identifications and redshifts, providing us a rich and robust dataset

information available, we constrain the LFs at 8, 12, 15 and 24micron. We also
extrapolate total IR luminosities from our best-fit to the observed SEDs of
each source, and use this to derive the bolometric LF and comoving volume
emissivity up to z~2.5. In the 0<z<1 interval, the bolometric IR luminosity
density evolves as (1+z)^3.8+/-0.4. Although more uncertain at higher-z, our
results show a flattening of the IR luminosity density at z>1. The mean
redshift of the peak in the source number density shifts with luminosity: the
brighest IR galaxies appear to be forming stars earlier in cosmic time (z>1.5),
while the less luminous ones keep doing it at more recent epochs (z~1 for
L(IR)<10^11L_sun). Our results suggest a rapid increase of the galaxy IR
comoving volume emissivity back to z~1 and a constant average emissivity at
z>1. We also seem to find a difference in the evolution rate of the source
number densities as a function of luminosity, a downsizing evolutionary pattern
similar to that reported from other samples of cosmic sources.

are able to map the scattered brightness astrometrically with much higher
resolution than the diffractive limit of the interferometer. We employ this
technique to measure an extremely anisotropic scattered image of the pulsar
B0834+06 at 327 MHz. We find that the scattering occurs in a compact region
about 420 pc from the Earth. This image has two components, both essentially
linear and nearly parallel. The primary feature, which is about 16 AU long and
less than 0.5 AU in width, is highly inhomogeneous on spatial scales as small
as 0.05 AU. The second feature is much fainter and is displaced from the axis
of the primary feature by about 9 AU. We find that the velocity of the
scattering plasma is 16+-10 km/s approximately parallel to the axis of the
linear feature. The origin of the observed anisotropy is unclear and we discuss
two very different models. It could be, as has been assumed in earlier work,
that the turbulence on spatial scales of ~1000 km is homogeneous but
anisotropic. However it may be that the turbulence on these scales is
homogeneous and isotropic but the anisotropy is produced by highly elongated
(filamentary) inhomogeneities of scale 0.05-16 AU.

their homogeneous measures, actually equivalent to the intrinsic
(Q-1)-dimensional and (Q-2)-dimensional Hausdorff measures with respect to some

inequality, involving the mean curvature of the hypersurface, proven by Michael
and Simon [63] and, independently by Allard [1]. In particular, from this
result one may deduce some related Sobolev-type inequalities; see Section 7.
The strategy of the proof is inspired by the classical one. In particular, we
shall begin by proving some linear isoperimetric inequalities. Once this is
proven, one can deduce a local monotonicity formula and then conclude the proof
by a covering argument. We stress however that there are many differences, due
to our different geometric setting. Some of the tools which have been developed
ad hoc in this paper are, in order, a ``blow-up'' theorem, which also holds for
characteristic points, and a smooth Coarea Formula for the HS-gradient; see
Section 3 and Section 4. Other tools are the horizontal integration by parts
formula and the 1st variation of the H-perimeter already developed in [68],
[69], and here generalized to hypersurfaces having non-empty characteristic
set. Some natural applications of these results are in the study of minimal and
constant horizontal mean curvature hypersurfaces. Moreover we shall prove some

shift of interference fringe in Michelson interferometer is absent because of
the absence of particles on the light path. The shift of interference fringe
appears only at a certain concentration of particles in the luminiferous
medium. The increase of the remnant air pressure in the optical tubes of the
interferometer (of the length 6 m in each arm) from 1 mm Hg to 1500 mm Hg
reveals first indications of the interference fringe shift (about 0.015 of its
width) only at the air pressure 300 mm Hg ($n$ = 1.00014...). The increase of
the air pressure in optical tubes up to 760 mm Hg ($n$ = 1.0003...) adds twice
the amplitude of the harmonic shift of the interference fringe giving ~0.03,
and at the pressure 1500 mm Hg the harmonic fringe shift ~0.06 became
conspicuous. The S-shaped with the change of sign dependence of the fringe
shift on the index of refraction $n$ was found. Thus the estimation of the
horizontal projection of the velocity of the Earth relative to aether is
obtained. At the latitude of Obninsk this velocity varies depending on the time
of day and night within 140 - 480 km/s. The forth version of the report is
complemented with the account of the harmful effect on registering the shift
$\Delta X_m$ of the interference fringe of the improperly installed in
turning-points of the zigzag light path glass mirrors. The nullifying of the
shift in air interferometers may occur because of opposite signs of
contributions of the air and glass optical media through the discovered by me
law $\Delta X_m \sim l\Delta\epsilon(1-\Delta\epsilon)$. This may be the cause
of obtaining negative results in majority of Michelson-type experiments known

high-mass (log M*/M_sun > 10) spiral galaxies we find no evidence to suggest
any such environmental dependence, implying that internal drivers are governing
their size evolution. For intermediate/low-mass spirals (log M*/M_sun < 10) we
find evidence, significant at the 2-sigma level, for a possible environmental
dependence on galaxy sizes: the mean effective radius a_e for lower-mass
spirals is ~15-20 per cent larger in the field than in the cluster. This is due
to a population of low-mass large-a_e field spirals that are largely absent
from the cluster environments. These large-a_e field spirals contain extended
stellar discs not present in their cluster counterparts. This suggests the
fragile extended stellar discs of these spiral galaxies may not survive the
environmental conditions in the cluster. Our results suggest that internal

point sources in IC131, after NGC604 the second most X-ray luminous giant HII
region in M33. The X-ray emission is detected only in the south eastern part of
IC131 (named IC131-se) and is limited to an elliptical region of ~200pc in
extent. This region appears to be confined towards the west by a hemispherical
shell of warm ionized gas and only fills about half that volume. Although the
corresponding X-ray spectrum has 1215 counts, it cannot conclusively be told
whether the extended X-ray emission is thermal, non-thermal, or a combination
of both. A thermal plasma model of kT_e=4.3keV or a single power law of
Gamma=2.1 fit the spectrum equally well. If the spectrum is purely thermal
(non-thermal), the total unabsorbed X-ray luminosity in the 0.35-8keV energy
band amounts to L_X = 6.8(8.7)x10^35erg/s. Among other known HII regions
IC131-se seems to be extreme regarding the combination of its large extent of
the X-ray plasma, the lack of massive O stars, its unusually high electron
temperature (if thermal), and the large fraction of L_X emitted above 2keV
(~40-53%). A thermal plasma of ~4keV poses serious challenges to theoretical
models, as it is not clear how high electron temperatures can be produced in
HII regions in view of mass-proportional and collisionless heating. If the gas
is non-thermal or has non-thermal contributions, synchrotron emission would
clearly dominate over inverse Compton emission. It is not clear if the same
mechanisms which create non-thermal X-rays or accelerate CRs in SNRs can be
applied to much larger scales of 200pc. In both cases the existing theoretical
models for giant HII regions and superbubbles do not explain the hardness and
extent of the X-ray emission in IC131-se.

investigate the sum $\sum_{k=0}^{p^a-1}\binom{hp^a-1}{k}\binom{2k}{k}/m^k$ mod
p^2, where h,m are p-adic integers with m\not=0 (mod p). For example, we show
that if h\not=0 (mod p) and p^a>3 then $$
sum_{k=0}^{p^a-1}\binom{hp^a-1}{k}\binom{2k}{k}(-h/2)^k
=(\frac{1-2h}{p^a})(1+h((4h-2)^{p-1}/h^{p-1}-1)) (mod p^2),$$ where (-) denotes
the Jacobi symbol. Here is another remarkable congruence: If p>3 then
$$\sum_{k=0}^{p^a-1}\binom{p^a-1}{k}\binom{2k}{k}(-1)^k =3^{p-1}(\frac{p^a}3)
(mod p^2).$$
