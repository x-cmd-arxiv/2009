classical phase space containing all 6D classical phase spaces as symplectic
submanifolds. The evaluation maps $e_z: f\to f(z)$ of wave functions on T are
relativistic coherent states reducing to the Gaussian coherent states in the

density on all 6D phase spaces in T which, when integrated over the ""momentum""
variables y, gives a conserved spacetime probability current whose time
component is a positive regularization of the usual one. Similar results are
obtained for Dirac particles, where the evaluation maps $e_z$ are spinor-valued
relativistic coherent states. For free quantized Klein-Gordon and Dirac fields,
the above formalism extends to n-particle/antiparticle coherent states whose

tentatively identified as Ly-alpha at z=6.95 and z=7.69 in two of the objects.
The third object is placed at z~1.6 based on a 24um and weak optical detection.
A comparison with the spectral energy distributions of known z<7 galaxies,
including objects with strong spectral lines, large extinction, and large
systematic uncertainties in the photometry yields no objects with similar
colors. However, the lambda>1um properties of all three objects can be matched
to optically detected sources with photometric redshifts at z~1.8, so the
non-detection in the i+ and z+ bands are the primary factors which favors a z>7
solution. If any of these objects are at z~7 the bright end of the luminosity
function is significantly higher at z>7 than suggested by previous studies, but
consistent within the statistical uncertainty and the dark matter halo
distribution. If these objects are at low redshift, the Lyman-Break selection
must be contaminated by a previously unknown population of low redshift objects
with very strong breaks in their broad band spectral energy distributions and
blue NIR colors. The implications of this result on luminosity function
evolution at high redshift is discussed. We show that the primary limitation of

classical bulge sooner than those of a pseudobulge. Detailed abundance studies
of bulge stars is a key to investigate the origin, history, and classification
of the bulge. The aim is to add to the discussion on the origin of the bulge
and to study detailed abundances determined from near-IR spectra for bulge
giants already investigated with optical spectra, the latter also providing the
stellar parameters which are very significant for the results of the present
study. Especially, the important CNO elements are better determined in the
near-IR. High-resolution, near-infrared spectra in the H band are recorded
using the CRIRES spectrometer on the Very Large Telescope. The CNO abundances
can all be determined from the numerous molecular lines in the wavelength range
observed. Abundances of the alpha elements are also determined from the near-IR
spectra. [O/Fe], [Si/Fe] and [S/Fe] are enhanced up to metallicities of at
least [Fe/H]=-0.3, after which they decline. This suggests that the Milky Way
bulge experienced a rapid and early star-formation history like that of a
classical bulge. However, a similarity between the bulge trend and the trend of
the local thick disk seems present. Such a similarity could suggest that the
bulge has a pseudobulge origin. Our [C/Fe] trend does not show any increase
with [Fe/H] which could have been expected if W-R stars have contributed
substantially to the C abundances. No ""cosmic scatter"" can be traced around our
observed abundance trends; the scatter found is expected, given the
observational uncertainties.

We investigate the spectral behaviour of the TNOs and Centaurs observed, and we
analyse the spectral slopes distribution of the full data set coming from this
LP and from the literature. We computed the spectral slope for each observed
object, and searched for possible weak absorption features. A statistical
analysis was performed on a total sample of 73 TNOs and Centaurs to look for
possible correlations between dynamical classes, orbital parameters, and
spectral gradient. We obtained new spectra for 28 bodies, 15 of which were
observed for the first time. All the new presented spectra are featureless,
including 2003 AZ84, for which a faint and broad absorption band possibly
attributed to hydrated silicates on its surface has been reported. The data
confirm a wide variety of spectral behaviours, with neutral--grey to very red
gradients. An analysis of the spectral slopes available from this LP and in the
literature for a total sample of 73 Centaurs and TNOs shows that there is a
lack of very red objects in the classical population. We present the results of
the statistical analysis of the spectral slope distribution versus orbital
parameters. In particular, we confirm a strong anticorrelation between spectral
slope and orbital inclination for the classical population. A strong
correlation is also found between the spectral slope and orbital eccentricity
for resonant TNOs, with objects having higher spectral slope values with
increasing eccentricity.

vertices of $K'$ at the midpoints of the edges of $K$.
  More generally, for any fixed $m$ in $(0,1)$ one may define a sequence of
polygons $\{K^{t}\}_{t\ge 0}$ where each polygon $K^{t}$ is obtained by
dividing every edge of $K^{t-1}$ into the ratio $m:(1-m)$ in the
counterclockwise (or clockwise) direction and taking these division points to
be the vertices of $K^{t}$.
  We are interested in the following problem
  {\it Let $m$ be a fixed number in $(0,1)$ and let $n\ge 3$ be a fixed

the properties of high temperature coronal plasma in extraordinary detail. We
examine the emission in the core of an active region and find three independent

an individual pixel. Short-lived impulsive heating events are observed, but
they appear to be unrelated to the steady emission that dominates the active
region. Furthermore, we find no evidence for warm emission that is spatially
correlated with the hot emission, as would be expected if the high temperature
loops are the result of impulsive heating. Finally, we also find that
intensities in the ""moss"", the footpoints of high temperature loops, are
consistent with steady heating models provided that we account for the local
expansion of the loop from the base of the transition region to the corona. In
combination, these results provide strong evidence that the heating in the core
of an active region is effectively steady, that is, the time between heating
events is short relative to the relevant radiative and conductive cooling
times.

the lack of resolution does not play a significant role, we demonstrate that it
may be impossible even in most radio loud sources for more than a small
percentage of the core radiation at radio wavelengths to come from the jet
base. We find for 3C279 that $\sim85$ percent of the core flux at 15 GHz must
come from a separate, reasonably stable, region that is not part of the jet

structure of satellite galaxies orbiting a Milky Way-like potential. Our work
is motivated by observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the Local Group,
for which often a distinction is possible between a cold centrally concentrated
metal rich and a hot, extended metal poor population. We find that an important
attenuation of the initial differences in the distribution of the two stellar
components occurs for orbits with small pericentric radii (r_per < 20 kpc).
This is mainly due to: i) the loss of the gravitational support provided by the
dark matter component after tidal stripping takes place, which forces a
re-configuration of the luminous components, and ii) tides preferentially
affect the more extended stellar component, leading to a net decrease in its
velocity dispersion as a response for the mass loss, which thus shrinks the
kinematical gap. We apply these ideas to the Sculptor and Carina dwarf
spheroidals. Differences in their orbits might help to explain, under the
assumption of similar initial configurations, why in the former a clear
kinematical separation between metal poor and metal rich stars is apparent,
while in Carina this segregation is significantly more subtle.

cooling, and escape over the entire dynamic range of the FIR-radio correlation
(FRC), from normal galaxies to starbursts, over the redshift interval 0 <= z <=
10. Normal galaxies with low star-formation rates become radio-faint at high z,
because Inverse Compton (IC) losses off the CMB cool CR electrons and positrons
rapidly, suppressing their nonthermal radio emission. However, we find that
this effect occurs at higher redshifts than previously expected, because
escape, bremsstrahlung, ionization, and starlight IC losses act to counter this
effect and preserve the radio luminosity of galaxies. The radio dimming of
star-forming galaxies at high z is not just a simple competition between
magnetic field energy density and the CMB energy density; the CMB must also
compete with every other loss process. We predict relations for the critical
redshift when radio emission is significantly suppressed compared to the z ~ 0
FRC as a function of star-formation rate per unit area. Additionally, we
provide a quantitative explanation for the relative radio brightness of some
high-z submillimeter galaxies. We show that at fixed star formation rate
surface density, galaxies with larger CR scale heights are radio bright with
respect to the FRC, because of weaker bremsstrahlung and ionization losses
compared to compact starbursts. We predict that these ""puffy starbursts"" should
have steeper radio spectra than compact galaxies with the same star-formation
rate surface density. We find that radio bright submillimeter galaxies alone
cannot explain the excess radio emission reported by ARCADE2, but they may
significantly enhance the diffuse radio background with respect to a naive
application of the z ~ 0 FRC.

(increasingly used in many sectors, such as manufacturing, aerospace,

big issue, since failures can have economics consequences and can also endanger
human life. Model-based specifications of a component-based system permit to
explicitly model the structure and behaviour of components and their
integration. In particular Software Architectures (SA) has been advocated as an
effective means to produce quality systems. In this chapter by combining
different technologies and tools for analysis and development, we propose an
architecture-centric model-driven approach to validate required properties and
to generate the system code. Functional requirements are elicited and used for
identifying expected properties the architecture shall express. The
architectural compliance to the properties is formally demonstrated, and the
produced architectural model is used to automatically generate the Java code.
Suitable transformations assure that the code is conforming to both structural
and behavioural SA constraints. This chapter describes the process and
discusses how some existing tools and languages can be exploited to support the
approach.

10^32-33 erg/s), variable X-ray source in the vicinity (within ~6"") of the
enigmatic star V838 Mon, which underwent a spectacular outburst in early 2002.
Spectral modeling of the XMM-Newton X-ray source indicates the presence of two
plasma components with characteristic temperatures of TX ~ 2x10^6K and
~1.5x10^7K, attenuated by an absorbing column (N_H ~ 4 x 10^21cm^-2) that is
consistent with the visual extinction measured toward V838 Mon (A_V ~ 2). No
such luminous source was detected in the immediate vicinity of V838 Mon in
Chandra/ACIS-S observations obtained about one year after outburst or, most
recently, in 2010 January. The two XMM source spectral components appear to be
marginally spatially resolved, with the spatial centroid of the hard component
lying closer to (within ~2"" of) the position of V838 Mon than the broad-band
source or the soft source component; however, if there are two sources at or
near V838 Mon, the Chandra nondetections would imply that both of them are
variable. An alternative is that there is a single variable source, and that
the apparent spatial separation may actually be due to photon-counting
statistics or is perhaps instrumental in origin. We consider constraints placed
by the X-ray detection and nondetections on a stellar merger model for the 2002
V838 Mon outburst, in which the spun-up merger product drives a powerful
magnetic dynamo. Alternatively, the transient behavior of the X-ray source
could indicate that the X-rays arose as a consequence of an interaction between
V838 Mon's ejecta and its early-type (B3 V) companion.

lack of error checking and correcting (ECC) capability in the memory subsystems
of graphics cards has been cited as a hindrance to the acceptance of GPUs as
high-performance coprocessors, but the impact of this design has not been
previously quantified.
  In this article we present MemtestG80, our software for assessing memory
error rates on NVIDIA G80 and GT200-architecture-based graphics cards.
Furthermore, we present the results of a large-scale assessment of GPU error
rate, conducted by running MemtestG80 on over 20,000 hosts on the Folding@home
distributed computing network. Our control experiments on consumer-grade and
dedicated-GPGPU hardware in a controlled environment found no errors. However,
our survey over cards on Folding@home finds that, in their installed
environments, two-thirds of tested GPUs exhibit a detectable, pattern-sensitive
rate of memory soft errors. We demonstrate that these errors persist after
controlling for overclocking and environmental proxies for temperature, but
depend strongly on board architecture.

taken into account, the identification of IR cutoff with Hubble radius
$H^{-1}$, in flat universe, can simultaneously drive accelerated expansion and
solve the coincidence problem. Based on this, we demonstrate that in a non-flat
universe the natural choice for IR cutoff could be the apparent horizon radius,
$\tilde{r}_A={1}/{\sqrt{H^2+k/a^2}}$. We show that any interaction of dark

of the energy densities of both components thus solving the coincidence
problem. We also verify that for a universe filled with dark energy and dark
matter the Friedmann equation can be written in the form of the modified first
law of thermodynamics, $dE=T_hdS_h+WdV$, at apparent horizon. In addition, the
generalized second law of thermodynamics is fulfilled in a region enclosed by
the apparent horizon. These results hold regardless of the specific form of

total magnitude, half-light radius, effective surface brightness, and Sersic n,
we fit r^{1/4} law and Sersic function 2-D surface brightness profiles to each
of the galaxies in our sample. Using simulated galaxies, we test how the
assumed profile affects the derived parameters and how the uncertainties affect
our Fundamental Plane results. We find that while fitting galaxies which have
Sersic index n < 4 with r^{1/4} law profiles systematically overestimates the
galaxy radius and flux, the combination of profile parameters that enter the
Fundamental Plane has uncertainties that are small. Average systematic offsets
and associated random uncertainties in magnitude and log r_e for n > 2 galaxies
fitted with r^{1/4} law profiles are -0.1+-0.3 and 0.1+-0.2 respectively. The
combination of effective radius and surface brightness, log r_e - \beta log
<I>_e, that enters the Fundamental Plane produces offsets smaller than
-0.02+-0.10. This systematic error is insignificant and independent of galaxy
magnitude or size. A catalog of photometry and surface brightness profile
parameters is presented for three of the clusters in our sample, RX

reaches synchronization and the spiraling-in process substantially slows down.

before the onset of a CE phase. Such stable synchronized orbits allow the RGB
star to lose mass prior to the onset of the CE phase. Even after the secondary
enters the giant envelope, the rotational velocity is high enough to cause an
enhanced mass-loss rate. Our results imply that it is crucial to include the
pre-CE evolution when studying the outcome of the CE phase. We find that many

rotational variability of pressure-sensitive spectroscopic features, that can
be analysed using phase-resolved spectroscopic observations. In this work we
continue the presentation of results of the magnetic pressure studies in mCP

Hgamma spectral lines during full rotation cycle of the star. Then these

which accounts for the Lorentz force effects. We used the LLmodels stellar
model atmosphere code for the calculation of the magnetic pressure effects in
the atmosphere of 56Ari taking into account realistic chemistry of the star and
accurate computations of the microscopic plasma properties. The Synth3 code was
employed to simulate phase-resolved variability of Balmer lines. We demonstrate
that the model with the outward-directed Lorentz force in the dipole+quadrupole

atmospheres are computationally intensive and are almost universally performed

approximation in the rate equations has recently been questioned. We calculate
the effective recombination time of hydrogen in SN II using our general purpose
model atmosphere code PHOENIX. While we find that the recombination time for
the conditions of SNe II at early times is increased over the classical value
for the case of a simple hydrogen model atom with energy levels corresponding
to just the first 2 principle quantum numbers, the classical value of the
recombination time is recovered in the case of a multi-level hydrogen atom. We
also find that the recombination time at most optical depths is smaller in the
case of a multi-level atom than for a simple two-level hydrogen atom. We find
that time dependence in the rate equations is important in the early epochs of
a supernova's lifetime. The changes due to the time dependent rate equation (at
constant input luminosity) are manifested in physical parameters such as the
level populations which directly affects the spectra. The H-alpha profile is
affected by the time dependent rate equations at early times. At later times
time dependence does not significantly modify the level populations and
therefore the H-alpha profile is roughly independent of whether the
steady-state or time-dependent approach is used.

by using the data set available from the type Ia supernovae (SNIa), CMB and BAO
observations. The constrained parameters are critical to determine the
quintessence or quintom character the model. The SNIa and joint SNIa+CMB+BAO
analysis give the best-fit results for $\beta$ with priors on $\Omega_{m0}$ and
$\omega_0$. Using montecarlo we obtained the best-fit values for $\beta$,
$\Omega_{m0}$ and $\omega_0$. The statefinder and $Om$ diagnosis have been used
to characterize the model over other DE models.
