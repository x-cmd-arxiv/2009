decoherence effects induced by the action of the Lorentz group. The amplitudes
of a pure quantum state representing the wave packet remain invariant
irrespective of the reference frame into which the wave packet has been
transformed. Transmitted information is encoded in the helicity degrees of
freedom of two correlated momentum modes. The helicity encoding is considered
to be particularly suitable for free-space communication. The integral part of
the story is information retrieval on the receiver's side. We employed probably
the simplest possible helicity (polarization) projection measurement originally
studied by Peres and Terno. Remarkably, the same conditions ensuring the
invariance of the wave packet also guarantee perfect distinguishability in the
process of measuring the helicity.

have been used to determine the relations between chemical structure and
biological activity, called quantitative structure activity relationships
(QSARs) for the compounds. Pre-processing of the dataset, which includes the
mapping from a large number of molecular descriptors in the original high
dimensional space to a small number of components in the lower dimensional
space while retaining the features of the original data, is the first step in
this process. A common practice is to use a mapping method for a dataset
without prior analysis. This pre-analysis has been stressed in our work by
applying it to two important classes of QSAR prediction problems: drug design
(predicting anti-HIV-1 activity) and predictive toxicology (estimating
hepatocarcinogenicity of chemicals). We apply one linear and two nonlinear
mapping methods on each of the datasets. Based on this analysis, we conclude
the nature of the inherent relationships between the elements of each dataset,
and hence, the mapping method best suited for it. We also show that proper
preprocessing can help us in choosing the right feature extraction tool as well
as give an insight about the type of classifier pertinent for the given
problem.

provide evidence for the existence of dual AGNs, but a good diagnostic for
selecting them is currently lacking. Starting from $\sim$ 7000 active galaxies
in SDSS DR7, we assemble a sample of 87 type 2 AGNs with double-peaked [O
III]5007, profiles. The nuclear obscuration in the type 2 AGNs allows us to
determine redshifts of host galaxies through stellar absorption lines. We
typically find that one peak is redshifted and another is blueshifted relative
to the host galaxy. We find a strong correlation between the ratios of the
shifts and the double peak fluxes. The correlation can be naturally explained
by the Keplerian relation predicted by models of co-rotating dual AGNs. The
current sample statistically favors that most of the [O III] double-peaked
sources are dual AGNs and disfavors other explanations, such as rotating disk
and outflows. These dual AGNs have a separation distance at $\sim 1$ kpc scale,
showing an intermediate phase of merging systems. The appearance of dual AGNs
is about $\sim 10^{-2}$, impacting on the current observational deficit of
binary supermassive black holes with a probability of $\sim 10^{-4}$ (Boroson &
Lauer).

which states that all MSO-expressible graph properties are decidable in linear

dependence on the MSO formula describing the problem is in general a tower of
exponentials of unbounded height, and there exist lower bounds proving that
this cannot be improved even if we restrict ourselves to deciding FO logic on

  In this paper we attempt to circumvent these lower bounds by focusing on a
subclass of bounded treewidth graphs, the graphs of bounded vertex cover. By
using a technique different from the standard decomposition and dynamic
programming technique of treewidth we prove that in this case the running time
implied by Courcelle's theorem can be improved dramatically, from
non-elementary to doubly and singly exponential for MSO and FO logic
respectively. Our technique relies on a new graph width measure we introduce,
for which we show some additional results that may indicate that it is of

upper bounds cannot be improved significantly, under widely believed complexity

system composed of two electrons or one electron coupled to a single nuclear
spin in isotopically purified group IV elemental and II-VI compound
semiconductors. The qubit consists of the singlet state and one of the triplet
states of two electrons or simply of an electron spin. These systems are free
from the decoherence due to the nuclear dipole-dipole interaction and are
advantageous for the long memory time. In the case of two electrons, the
protocol for the quantum state transfer between the electron spin qubit and the
nuclear spin qubit is based on the magnetic or electric field tuning of the
singlet-triplet state crossing and on the hyperfine coupling supplemented with
a well-defined scheme to initialize the nuclear spin. In the case of a single
electron qubit, the quantum state transfer is driven by the hyperfine
interaction itself without the need of the nuclear spin initialization. Many
practical systems are considered, e.g., two electrons loaded on a Si or ZnSe
quantum dot, a single electron charged state in a Si quantum dot doped with a P
atom, a single electron charged $ ^{28}$Si quantum dot doped with an isotope
atom of $ ^{29}$Si, and a localized electron system of Si:P and ZnSe:F in the
bulk crystal. General aspects of these systems are investigated and a
comparison of merits and demerits is made between the two-electron qubit and
the single-electron qubit.

Moreover, the atomic ensembles also function as quantum repeaters useful for
long distance quantum state transfer. We show the possibility of our scheme to
work in bad cavity or in weak coupling regime, which could much relax the

suppress the blinking altogether, or alternatively, manipulate the PL energy
peaks and intensities systematically to give non-random blinking. Our
theoretical strategy developed here is generic and can be applied to any

revealed on sky survey images as a distant ring galaxy is a rare case of polar
ring galaxy where the ring is only slightly inclined to the equatorial plane of
the central body. SDSS imaging indicates that the diameter of the ring is about
36 kpc. The SDSS data was combined with long-slit spectroscopic observations
and with Fabry-Perot Interferometer H-beta mapping obtained at the Russian
Academy of Sciences 6-m telescope. We derived the complex morphologies of this
presumed ring galaxy from a combination of SDSS images and from the kinematical
behaviour of the central body and of the ring, and determined the stellar
population compositions of the two components from SDSS colours, spectroscopy,
and evolutionary stellar synthesis models. The ring metallicity is slightly
under-abundant. The total luminosity and the total mass of the system are not
extreme, but the rather high M/L~20 indicates the presence of large amounts of
dark matter. Two alternative explanations of this object are proposed (1) a
ring formed by two semi-circular and tight spiral arms at the end of a central
bar with a warp or precession of the ring material. The object could,
therefore, be explained as an extreme SBa(R) galaxy, or (2) a Polar Ring Galaxy
where the inner object is an S0 and the ring is significantly more luminous
than the central object. The compound object would then be similar to the NGC
4650A galaxy, being a rare object with a polar component only modestly inclined
to the equatorial plane of the central body. Arguments for (and against) both
explanations are given and discussed, with the second alternative being more
acceptable.

quasi-paramagnet states, as signaled by a sharp peak in the specific heat and

just one half of the system without leads. Another lead effect is to enhance
the ferromagnetic order. Being a ferromagnet, a nanodisk can be used as a spin

control the spin of the nanodisk by an external spin current. We then propose a

calculated by increasing the role of vortex fluxes piercing Wilson loops with
contributions close to the trivial center element and by fluctuating the vortex
core size in the model of thick center vortices. By this method, a Coulombic
potential consistent with Casimir scaling is obtained. In addition, all other
features of the potential including a linear intermediate potential in
agreement with Casimir scaling and a large distance potential proportional to
the $N$-ality of the representation are restored. Therefore, the model of thick
center vortices may be used as a phenomenological model, which is able to
describe the potential for all regimes.

on how the underlying statistical properties of a given problem can help us

strongly convex with respect to some norm if and only if its conjugate function
is strongly smooth with respect to the dual norm. This result has already been
found to be a key component in deriving and analyzing several learning
algorithms. We demonstrate the potential of this framework by deriving novel
