the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory. The effective electron kinetic energy
threshold used is T_eff=3.5 MeV, the lowest analysis threshold yet achieved
with water Cherenkov detector data. In units of 10^6 cm^{-2} s^{-1}, the total
flux of active-flavor neutrinos from 8B decay in the Sun measured using the
neutral current (NC) reaction of neutrinos on deuterons, with no constraint on
the 8B neutrino energy spectrum, is found to be Phi_NC = 5.140
^{+0.160}_{-0.158} (stat) ^{+0.132}_{-0.117} (syst). These uncertainties are
more than a factor of two smaller than previously published results. Also
presented are the spectra of recoil electrons from the charged current reaction
of neutrinos on deuterons and the elastic scattering of electrons. A fit to the
SNO data in which the free parameters directly describe the total 8B neutrino
flux and the energy-dependent nu_e survival probability provides a measure of
the total 8B neutrino flux Phi_8B = 5.046 ^{+0.159}_{-0.152} (stat)
^{+0.107}_{-0.123} (syst). Combining these new results with results of all
other solar experiments and the KamLAND reactor experiment yields best-fit
values of the mixing parameters of theta_{12}=34.06 ^{+1.16}_{-0.84} degrees
and Delta m^2_{21}=7.59 ^{+0.20}_{-0.21} x 10^{-5} eV^2. The global value of
Phi_8B is extracted to a precision of ^{+2.38}_{-2.95} %. In a three-flavor
analysis the best fit value of sin^2\theta_{13} is 2.00 ^{+2.09}_{-1.63} x
10^{-2}. Interpreting this as a limit implies an upper bound of
sin^2\theta_{13} < 0.057 (95% C. L.).

the VEV of the stress-energy tensor and the classical one become comparable

velocity (zero shear rate) followed by a non linear change of the shear rate as
the walls are approached. The observed velocity gradients are compared to those
obtained from the knowledge of the shear stress across the channel and the
flow-curves (stress versus shear rate), the latter being determined in our
previous simulations of homogeneous shear flow. Furthermore, using the value of
the (dynamic) yield stress known from previous simulations, we estimate the
threshold body force for a complete arrest of the flow. Indeed, a blockage is
observed as the imposed force falls below this threshold value. Small but
finite shear rates are observed at stresses above the dynamic but below the
static yield stress. We discuss the possible role of the \blue{stick-slip like

five years over 100 papers have been published on this fascinating object. We
now know it to be a massive binary system with a 5.54-year period. In January
2009, Eta Car underwent one of its periodic low-states, associated with
periastron passage of the two massive stars. This event was monitored by an
intensive multi-wavelength campaign ranging from gamma-rays to radio. A large
amount of data was collected to test a number of evolving models including 3-D
models of the massive interacting winds. August 2009 was an excellent time for
observers and theorists to come together and review the accumulated studies, as
have occurred in four meetings since 1998 devoted to Eta Car. Indeed, Eta Car
behaved both predictably and unpredictably during this most recent periastron,
spurring timely discussions. Coincidently, WR140 also passed through periastron
in early 2009. It, too, is a intensively studied massive interacting binary.
Comparison of its properties, as well as the properties of other massive stars,
with those of Eta Car is very instructive. These well-known examples of evolved
massive binary systems provide many clues as to the fate of the most massive
stars. What are the effects of the interacting winds, of individual stellar
rotation, and of the circumstellar material on what we see as

of a binary LJ glass former is studied via MD simulations. In the quiescent
state, the model is well known for its sluggish dynamics and a two step
relaxation of correlation functions at low temperatures. An ideal glass
transition temperature of $T_c = 0.435$ has been identified in the previous
studies via the analysis of the system's dynamics in the frame work of the mode
coupling theory of the glass transition [W. Kob and H.C. Andersen, PRE 51, 4626
(1995)]. Here, we test wether a signature of this ideal glass transition can
also be found under shear. Indeed, the following distinction in the structural
relaxation is found: In the supercooled state, the structural relaxation is
dominated by the shear at relatively high shear rates, $\dot{\gamma}$, whereas
at sufficiently low $\dot{\gamma}$ the (shear-independent) equilibrium
relaxation is recovered. In contrast to this, the structural relaxation of a
\emph{glass} is always driven by shear. This distinct behavior of the
correlation functions is also reflected in the rheological response. In the
supercooled state, the shear viscosity, $\eta$, decreases with increasing shear
rate (shear thinning) at high shear rates, but then converges toward a constant
as the $\dot{\gamma}$ is decreased below a (temperature-dependent) threshold
value. Below $T_c$, on the other hand, the shear viscosity grows as $\eta
\propto 1/\dot{\gamma}$ suggesting a divergence at $\dot{\gamma} =0$. Thus,
within the accessible observation time window, a transition toward a
non-ergodic state seems to occur in the driven glass as the driving force
approaches zero.

clear non-flaring origin after the steep decay in a long gamma-ray burst (GRB):
GRB081028. A rising phase is likely present in all GRBs but is usually hidden
by the prompt tail emission and constitutes the first manifestation of what is
later to give rise to the shallow decay phase. Contemporaneous optical
observations reveal a rapid evolution of the injection frequency of a fast
cooling synchrotron spectrum through the optical band, which disfavours the
afterglow onset (start of the forward shock emission along our line of sight
when the outflow is decelerated) as the origin of the observed re-brightening.
We investigate alternative scenarios and find that the observations are
consistent with the predictions for a narrow jet viewed off-axis. The high
on-axis energy budget implied by this interpretation suggests different
physical origins of the prompt and (late) afterglow emission. Strong spectral
softening takes place from the prompt to the steep decay phase: we track the
evolution of the spectral peak energy from the gamma-rays to the X-rays and
highlight the problems of the high latitude and adiabatic cooling
interpretations. Notably, a softening of both the high and low spectral slopes
with time is also observed. We discuss the low on-axis radiative efficiency of
GRB081028 comparing its properties against a sample of Swift long GRBs with

process, degrees of freedom on smaller scales are eliminated to the favor of a
model suitable for efficient study of the system behavior on larger length and
time scales. We emphasize the need to distinguish between dynamic and static
properties regarding the model validation. A model which accurately reproduces
static properties may fail completely, when it comes to the dynamic behavior of
the system. Furthermore, we comment on the use of Monte Carlo method in polymer
science as compared to molecular dynamics simulations. Using the latter
approach, we also discuss results of recent computer simulations on the
properties of polymers close to solid substrates. This includes both generic
features (as also observed in the case of simpler molecular models) as well as
polymer specific properties. Predictive power of computer simulations is
highlighted by providing experimental evidence for these observations. Some
important implications of these results for an understanding of mechanical
properties of thin polymer films and coatings are also worked out.

oscillation parameter scenarios, the observed neutrino energy spectrum will
bear the signature of oscillations in Earth matter. Because the frequency of
the oscillations in energy depends on the pathlength traveled by the neutrinos

direction to the supernova. We explore here the possibility of constraining the

Good energy resolution (typical of scintillator detectors), well known
oscillation parameters, and optimistically large (but conceivable) statistics

emitted from the bed in an array of locations at the same time during Mode 1
emergence. Mode 2 emergence involves large discrete bubbles locally fluidizing
the granular bed and exiting the bed approximately above the injection site.
Bead diameter, bead density, and air flow rate were varied to investigate the
change in bubble release behavior at the top of the granular bed.
  This system is a useful model for methane seeps in lakes. Methane bubbles are
released from the decomposition of organic matter in the lake bed. The initial
size of the bubble determines how much of the gas is absorbed into the lake and
how much of the gas reaches the surface and is released into the atmosphere.
The size and behavior of the emerging bubbles may also affect the amount of
vertical mixing occurring in the lake, as well as the mixing from the lake bed
into the benthic layer.

adiabatically and radiatively cooling X-ray jets. The multi-temperature thermal
jet model reproduces well the strongest observed emission line fluxes. The
thermal model alone can not reproduce the continuum radiation in the XMM
spectral range, the fluorescent iron line and some broad spectral features.
Using the thermal jet-plus-reflection model, we find a notable contribution of
ionized reflection to the spectrum in the energy range from ~3 to 12 keV. The
reflecting surface is highly ionized (xi ~300), the illuminating radiation
spectrum is flat and probably strongly absorbed. We conclude that the reflected
spectrum is an evidence of the supercritical disc funnel, where the
illuminating radiation comes from deeper funnel regions, to be further
reflected in the outer visible funnel walls (r >~2*10^11 cm). We have not found
any evidences of reflection in the soft 0.8-2 keV energy range, instead, a soft
excess is detected, that does not depend on the thermal jet model details. This
soft component might prove to be the direct radiation of the visible funnel
wall. It is represented here either as black body radiation with the
temperature of ~0.1 keV and luminosity of L_bb ~3*10^37 erg/s, or with a
multicolour funnel (MCF) model. The soft spectral component has about the same
parameters as those found in ULXs.

maneuverability. Depending on the magnitude of phase difference between the
fore- and hind-wings of dragonfly, the vortical structures and their
interaction with wings become significantly changed, and so does the
aerodynamic performance. In this study, we consider hovering flights of
modelled dragonfly with three different phase differences (phi=-90, 90, 180
degrees). The three-dimensional wing shape is based on that of Aeschna juncea
(Norberg, 1972), and the Reynolds number is 1,000 based on the maximum
translational velocity and mean chord length. The numerical method is based on
an immersed boundary method (Kim et al., 2001). In counter-stroke (phi=180
degree), the wing-tip vortices from both wings are connected in the wake,
generating an entangled wing-tip vortex (e-WTV). A strong downward motion
induced by this vortex decreases the lift force in the following downstroke
(Kweon and Choi, 2008). When the fore-wing leads the hind-wing (phi=90 degree),
the hind-wing is submerged in the vortices generated by the fore-wing and
suffers from their induced downwash flow throughout the downstroke, resulting
in a significant reduction of lift force. On the other hand, when the hind-wing
leads the fore-wing (phi=-90 degree), the e-WTV is found only near the start of
hind-wing upstroke. In the following downstroke of hind-wing, most of the e-WTV
disappears and the hind-wing is little affected by this vortex, which produces
relatively large lift force.

to third order as a general characterization of the CMB anisotropies. We focus
our analysis in large scale anisotropies. At these angular scales, the
non-Gaussian description proposed in this work defaults (under certain
conditions) to an approximated local form of the weak non-linear coupling
inflationary model. In particular, quadratic and cubic terms are governed by
the non-linear coupling parameters f_nl and g_nl, respectively. The extension
proposed in this paper allows us to directly constrain these non-linear
parameters. Applying the proposed methodology to WMAP 5-yr data, we obtain -5.6
x 10^5 < g_nl < 6.4 x 10^5, at 95% CL. This result is in agreement with
previous findings obtained for equivalent non-Gaussian models and with
different non-Gaussian estimators. A model selection test is performed,
indicating that a Gaussian model is preferred to the non-Gaussian scenario.
When comparing different non-Gaussian models, we observe that a pure f_nl model
is the most favoured case, and that a pure g_nl model is more likely than a
general non-Gaussian scenario. Finally, we have analyzed the WMAP data in two
independent hemispheres, in particular the ones defined by the dipolar pattern
found by Hoftuft et al. 2009. We show that, whereas g_nl is still compatible
with zero for both hemispheres, it is not the case for f_nl (with a p-value
0.04). However, if anisotropy of the data is assumed, the distance between the
likelihood distributions for each hemisphere is larger than expected from
Gaussian and anisotropic simulations, also for g_nl (with a p-value of 0.001 in
the case of this parameter). This result is an extra evidence for the CMB
asymmetries previously reported in WMAP data.

S1=S2=0.97 for different mass ratios. Starting from a fiducial initial
separation of ri=50m, we perform 3.5PN evolutions down to rf=5m. At this final
fiducial separation, we compute the angular distribution of the spins with
respect to the final orbital angular momentum, L. We perform 16^4 simulations
for six mass ratios between q=1 and q=1/16 and compute the distribution of the
angles between L and Delta and L and S, directly related to recoil velocities
and total angular momentum. We find a small but statistically significant bias
of the distribution towards counter-alignment of both scalar products. To study
the merger of black-hole binaries, we turn to full numerical techniques. We
introduce empirical formulae to describe the final remnant black hole mass,
spin, and recoil velocity for merging black-hole binaries with arbitrary mass
ratios and spins. We then evaluate those formulae for randomly chosen
directions of the individual spins and magnitudes as well as the binary's mass
ratio. We found that the magnitude of the recoil velocity distribution decays
as P(v) \exp(-v/2500km/s), <v>=630km/s, and sqrt{<v^2> - <v>^2}= 534km/s,
leading to a 23% probability of recoils larger than 1000km/s, and a highly

power-law behavior with an exponent that is a combination of some of the
critical exponents of the transition.
  For each value of the shear field magnitude, labeled as $\dot{\gamma}$, $T_c$
has been estimated and two stages have been found: 1) a growing stage at low
values of $\dot{\gamma}$, where $T_c\sim\dot{\gamma}^\psi$ and $\psi=0.52(3)$;
2) a saturation regime at large $\dot{\gamma}$. The same values of
$T_c(\dot{\gamma})$ were found studying the dynamical evolution from the ground

60 or 80 GeV assuming a simple Fermi step model is not found when using a more
realistic one. We argue also that production of fast nucleons (with momenta $>
p_F$ in the nucleus rest frame) provides complementary information about the

strong mass segregation} solution for the stellar distribution around a massive
black hole. We compare our $N$-body results with those obtained by solving the
orbit-averaged Fokker-Planck (FP) equation in energy space. The $N$-body
segregation is slightly stronger than in the FP solution, but both confirm the
{\it robustness} of the regime of strong segregation when the number fraction
of heavy stars is a (realistically) small fraction of the total population. In
view of recent observations revealing a dearth of giant stars in the sub-parsec
region of the Milky Way, we show that the time scales associated with cusp
re-growth are not longer than $(0.1-0.25) \times T_{rlx}(r_h)$. These time
scales are shorter than a Hubble time for black holes masses $\mbul \lesssim 4
\times 10^6 M_\odot$ and we conclude that quasi-steady, mass segregated,
stellar cusps may be common around MBHs in this mass range. Since EMRI rates
scale as $\mbul^{-\alpha}$, with $\alpha \in [1\4,1]$, a good fraction of these
events should originate from strongly segregated stellar cusps.

observable modifications of, e.g., the mass function of halos as well as the

galaxy cluster counts and weak lensing observations, which probe structure
formation at small scales, are needed to falsify this class of models.

signatures of disks or central residual star formation. We select dEs in a
(projected) region around the central elliptical galaxies, and subdivide them
by their line-of-sight velocity into fast-moving and slow-moving ones. These
subsamples turn out to have significantly different shapes: while the fast dEs
are relatively flat objects, the slow dEs are nearly round. Likewise, when
subdividing the central dEs by their projected axial ratio into flat and round
ones, their distributions of line-of-sight velocities differ significantly: the
flat dEs have a broad, possibly two-peaked distribution, whereas the round dEs
show a narrow single peak. We conclude that the round dEs probably are on
circularized orbits, while the flat dEs are still on more eccentric or radial
orbits typical for an infalling population. In this picture, the round dEs
would have resided in the cluster already for a long time, or would even be a
cluster-born species, explaining their nearly circular orbits. They would thus
be the first generation of Virgo cluster dEs. Their shape could be caused by
dynamical heating through repeated tidal interactions. Further investigations
through stellar population measurements and studies of simulated galaxy
clusters would be desirable to obtain definite conclusions on their origin.

in damage worldwide. For residential construction, such failures are usually
associated with roofs, which see the largest aerodynamic loading. However,
determining aerodynamic loads on different portions of North American houses is
complicated by the lack of clear load paths and non-linear load sharing in wood
frame roofs. This problem of fluid-structure interaction requires both wind
tunnel testing and full-scale structural testing.
  A series of wind tunnel tests have been performed on a house in a simulated
atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), with the resulting wind-induced pressures
applied to the full-scale structure. The ABL was simulated for flow over open
country terrain where both velocity and turbulence intensity profiles, as well
as spectra, were matched with available full scale measurements for this type
of terrain. The first set of measurements was 600 simultaneous surface pressure
measurements over the entire house.
  A key feature of the surface pressure field is the occurrence of large,
highly non-Gaussian, peak uplift (suctions) on the roof. In order to better
understand which flow features cause this, PIV experiments were performed on
the wind tunnel model. These experiments were performed with time-resolved PIV
(sampling rate of 500 Hz) for a duration of 30 seconds. From the fluid dynamics
videos (low- and high-resolution) generated from the PIV data it is clear that
strong circulation is generated at the windward edge of the roof. These
vortices are eventually shed and convect along the roof. It is the presence of
this concentrated circulation which is responsible for the peak loading
observed.

we find that a particle action invariant under this Maxwell-Sim algebra again
describes a particle subject to the ordinary Lorentz force. One can also deform
the ISim algebra to DISim$_b$, where $b$ is a non-trivial dimensionless

necessity of Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) for coordinated cell
movement after damage. This MAPK activity is characterized by two wave-like
phenomena. One MAPK ""wave"" that originates immediately after injury, propagates
deep into the cell layer, and then rebounds back to the wound interface. After
this initial MAPK activity has largely disappeared, a second MAPK front
propagates slowly from the wound interface and continues into the tissue,
maintaining a sustained level of MAPK activity throughout the cell layer. It
has been suggested that the first wave is initiated by reactive oxygen species
(ROS) generated at the time of injury. In this paper, we develop a minimal
mechanistic diffusion-convection model that reproduces the observed behavior.
The main ingredients of our model are a competition between ligand (e.g.,
Epithelial Growth Factor) and ROS for the activation of Epithelial Growth
Factor Receptor (EGFR) and a second MAPK wave that is sustained by stresses
induced by the slow cell movement that closes the wound. We explore the
mathematical properties of the model in connection with the bistability of the
MAPK cascade and look for traveling wave solutions consistent with the

be important in transporting energy to higher levels. Here we explore the

waves back downward as slow magnetoacoustic waves well before they reach the

there can be substantial conversion to either or both upgoing Alfven and

it is possible to observe inflows in ionized gas along nuclear spirals and
filaments. In more luminous AGN inflows have been observed also in hot
molecular gas (H_2) emission in the near-IR. In most cases the H_2 kinematics
is dominated by circular rotation in the plane around the nucleus, tracing the
AGN feeding. The ionized gas, on the other hand, traces the AGN feedback. Its
kinematics shows two components: (1) one originating in the plane, and
dominated by circular rotation; (2) another outflowing along the Narrow-Line
Region (NLR) whose flux distribution and kinematics frequently correlate with
structures seen in radio maps. Mass outflow rates along the NLR range from
10^-2 to 1 M_sun yr^-1, corresponding to 10-100 times the accretion rate to the
AGN, indicating that most of the NLR gas mass has been entrained from the
galaxy plane. The average kinetic power of the NLR outflows is ~10^-4 times the

are sacrificed to create this flow of air. Although high speed imaging of spore
launch in a wild isolate of the dung fungus \emph{Ascobolus} shows that the
synchronization of spore ejections is self-organized, which could lead to
spores delaying their ejection to avoid being sacrificed, simulations and

ordered when the gel is cooled down from a higher gelation temperature, the
polymeric backbones tend to elongate along the direction parallel to the

spontaneous buckling of polymeric network and the spatial modulation of nematic

temperature higher than that of the boiling point of water. Initially, the drop
temperature increases slowly mainly due to heat transfer diffusion; convective
heat transfer is small because the motion takes place at a small Reynolds
number. Once the drop reaches the bottom of the container, it sticks to the
surface with a certain contact angle. Then, a part of the drop vaporizes: the
nucleation point may appear at the wall, the interface or the bulk of the drop.
The vapor expands inside the drop and deforms its interface. The way in which
the vapor expands, either smooth or violent, depends on the location of the
nucleation point and oil temperature. Furthermore, for temperatures close to
the boiling point of water, the drops are stable (overheated); the vaporization
does not occur spontaneously but it may be triggered with an external
perturbation. In this case the growth of the vapor bubble is rather violent.
Many visualization for different conditions will be shown and predictions of
the growth rate will be discussed.

relatively weak rheological properties of most such monolayers have rendered
their study difficult or impossible. A novel technique to measure the dynamical
properties of fluid-fluid interfaces have developed accordingly. We
microfabricate micron-scale ferromagnetic disks, place them on fluid-fluid
interfaces, and use external electromagnets to exert torques upon them. By
measuring the rotation that results from a known external torque, we compute
the rotational drag, from which we deduce the rheological properties of the

stress, is visualized during steady rotation. Remarkably slow relaxation time
was also found due to slow unwinding of the stretched domains.

spinors reflecting already the symmetry properties of space-time, it seems to
be possible to justify such an attitude. According to this, space-time
symmetries can be considered as a consequence of a representation of quantum
states by quantum bits. Internal symmetries are assumed to refer to relations
of such fundamental objects, which are contained within the state of one single
