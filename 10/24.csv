evaporation is a simple phenomena but still unclear concerning the mechanisms

at the triple line. However, the rate of evaporation is still empirically
predicted due to the lack of knowledge on the convection cells which develop

complicated than it appears due to the coupling by conduction with the heating

circular birefringence induced by a single spin as a result of cavity quantum
electrodynamics and the spin selection rule of trion transition (Pauli
blocking). The EBS is robust and it is immune to the fine structure splitting
in a realistic quantum dot. This quantum device can be used for
deterministically creating photon-spin, photon-photon and spin-spin

confined in two-dimensional narrow channels driven by a non-uniform force F(y).
We considered linear-gradient, parabolic and delta-like driving-force profiles.
This driving force induces melting of the colloidal solid (i.e., shear-induced
melting), and the colloidal motion experiences a transition from elastic to
plastic regime with increasing F. For intermediate F (i.e., in the transition
region) the response of the system, i.e., the distribution of the velocities of
the colloidal chains, in general does not coincide with the profile of the
driving force F(y), and depends on the magnitude of F, the width of the channel
and the density of colloids. For example, we show that the onset of plasticity
is first observed near the boundaries while the motion in the central region is
elastic. This is explained by: (i) (in)commensurability between the chains due
to the larger density of colloids near the boundaries, and (ii) the gradient in
F. Our study provides a deeper understanding of the dynamics of colloids in
channels and could be accessed in experiments on colloids (or in dusty plasma)
with, e.g., asymmetric channels or in the presence of a gradient potential

($\theta_K$) angles, as well as the Hall conductivity ($\sigma_{xy}$) in a
SrRuO$_3$ film in the 115-1400 meV energy range. The magnetic field,
temperature, and frequency dependence of the Hall effect is explored. The MIR
magneto-optical response shows very strong frequency dependence, including sign
changes. Below 200 meV, the MIR $\theta_H (T)$ changes sign between 120 and 150
K, as is observed in dc Hall measurements. Above 200 meV, the temperature
dependence of $\theta_H$ is similar to that of the dc magnetization and the
measurements are in good agreement with predictions from a band calculation for
the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE). The temperature and frequency
dependence of the measured Hall effect suggests that whereas the behavior above
200 meV is consistent with an intrinsic AHE, the extrinsic AHE plays an
important role in the lower energy response.

Separation (BSS) problem, for the nonlinear mixing model that they introduced
in that paper. They proposed to solve this problem by using
information-theoretic tools, more precisely by minimizing the mutual
information (MI) of the outputs of the separating structure. When applying the
MI approach to BSS problems, one usually determines the analytical expressions
of the derivatives of the MI with respect to the parameters of the considered
separating model. In the literature, these calculations were mainly reported
for linear mixtures up to now. They are more complex for nonlinear mixtures,
due to dependencies between the considered quantities. Moreover, the notations
commonly employed by the BSS community in such calculations may become
misleading when using them for nonlinear mixtures, due to the above-mentioned
dependencies. We claim that the calculations reported in [4] contain an error,
because they did not take into account all these dependencies. In this
document, we therefore explain this phenomenon, by showing the effect of
indirect dependencies on the application of the MI approach to the mixing and
separating models considered in [4]. We thus introduce a corrected expression
of the gradient of the considered BSS criterion based on MI. This correct
gradient may then e.g. be used to optimize the adaptive coefficients of the
considered separating system by means of the well-known gradient descent
algorithm. As explained hereafter, this investigation has some similarities
with an analysis that we previously reported in another arXiv document [3].
However, these two investigations concern different problems (mixture and
separating structure, mathematical tools: see paper).

the feasibility of end-to-end routing. Motivated by the question of how
successful a protocol can hope to perform in a network whose reliability is
guaranteed by as few assumptions as possible, we combine the main
""unreliability"" features encountered in network models in the literature,
allowing our model to exhibit all of these characteristics simultaneously. In
particular, our model captures networks that exhibit the following properties:
1) On-line; 2) Dynamic Topology; 3)Distributed/Local Control 4) Asynchronous
Communication; 5) (Polynomially) Bounded Memory; 6) No Minimal Connectivity
Assumptions. In the confines of this network, we evaluate throughput
performance and prove matching upper and lower bounds. In particular, using
competitive analysis (perhaps somewhat surprisingly) we prove that the optimal
competitive ratio of any on-line protocol is 1/n (where n is the number of
nodes in the network), and then we describe a specific protocol and prove that
it is n-competitive. The model we describe in the paper and for which we
achieve the above matching upper and lower bounds for throughput represents the
""worst-case"" network, in that it makes no reliability assumptions. In many
practical applications, the optimal competitive ratio of 1/n may be
unacceptable, and consequently stronger assumptions must be imposed on the
network to improve performance. However, we believe that a fundamental starting
point to understanding which assumptions are necessary to impose on a network
model, given some desired throughput performance, is to understand what is
achievable in the worst case for the simplest task (namely end-to-end routing).

shape of the stellar mass function (MF) in these clusters, because the escape
probability of a star depends on its mass. The objective of this paper is to
provide and to apply a simple physical model for the evolution of the MF in
star clusters for a large range of the parameter space. The model is derived
from the basic principles of two-body encounters and energy considerations. It
is independent of the adopted mass loss rate or initial mass function (IMF),
and contains stellar evolution, stellar remnant retention, dynamical
dissolution in a tidal field, and mass segregation. It is found that the MF
evolution in star clusters depends on the disruption time, remnant retention
fraction, initial-final stellar mass relation, and IMF. Low-mass stars are
preferentially ejected after t~400 Myr. Before that time, masses around 15-20%
of the maximum stellar mass are lost. The degree of low-mass star depletion
grows for increasing disruption times, but can be quenched when the retained
fraction of massive remnants is large. The highly depleted MFs of certain
Galactic globular clusters are explained by the enhanced low-mass star
depletion that occurs for low remnant retention fractions. Unless the retention
fraction is exceptionally large, dynamical evolution always decreases the
mass-to-light ratio. The modeled evolution of the MF is consistent with N-body
simulations when adopting identical boundary conditions. However, it is found
that the results from N-body simulations only hold for their specific boundary
conditions and should not be generalised to all clusters. It is concluded that
the model provides an efficient method do understand the evolution of the
stellar MF in star clusters under widely varying conditions.

redshift of distant sources over time. A measurement of this drift would
provide us with a direct probe of expansion history. The Lyman alpha forest has
been recognized as the best candidate for this experiment, but the signal would
be weak and it will take next generation large telescopes coupled with
ultra-stable high resolution spectrographs to reach the cm/s resolution
required. One source of noise that has not yet been assessed is the transverse
motion of Lyman alpha absorbers, which varies the gravitational potential in
the line of sight and subsequently shifts the positions of background
absorption lines. We examine the relationship between the pure cosmic signal
and the observed redshift drift in the presence of moving Lyman alpha clouds,
particularly the collapsed structures associated with Lyman limit systems
(LLSs) and damped Lyman alpha systems (DLAs). Surprisingly, the peculiar
velocities and peculiar accelerations both enter the expression, although the
acceleration term stands alone as an absolute error, whilst the velocity term
appears as a fractional noise component. An estimate of the magnitude of the
noise reassures us that the motion of the Lyman alpha absorbers will not pose a
threat to the detection of the signal.

necessarily produce singular non-imaginary self-dual flux. Moreover, since
conformally Calabi-Yau geometries cannot be supported by non-imaginary

shows. We also briefly discuss supersymmetry-breaking perturbations at large

timescales: the 'starburst' mode of star formation (SF). Recent work has shown
that detailed observations can be used to separate the stellar mass profile of
these 'burst relic' components in local systems. Together with the assumption
that some Kennicutt-Schmidt law holds, and that the burst was indeed a
dissipational gas-rich event, we show that the observed profiles can be
inverted to obtain the time and space-dependent SF history of each burst.
Performing this with a large sample of well-studied spheroids, we show that the
implied bursts scale in magnitude, mass, peak SFR, and spatial extent with
galaxy mass in simple manner, and provide fits to these correlations. Burst
masses are ~10% the total spheroid mass; timescales a mass-independent ~10^8
yr; peak SFR ~M_burst/t_burst; and they decay in power-law fashion ~t^-2.4.
Sizes are ~0.1 R_e(spheroid), but grow with time. Combined with measurements of
the nuclear stellar population ages of these systems (i.e. burst times), it is
possible to re-construct the burst contribution to the distribution of SFRs and
IR luminosity functions at all redshifts. The burst LF agrees well with
observed IR LFs at the brightest luminosities, at z=0-2. At low-L, bursts are
always unimportant; the transition to their importance increases from ULIRG
luminosities at z~0 to HyLIRG luminosities at z~2. At all redshifts, bursts are
a small fraction (~5-10%) of the total SFR density. We discuss possible
implications of tension between maximum relic stellar mass densities in massive

laser-assisted tunneling between adjacent sites creates an effective magnetic

the Harper Hamiltonian, with a flux across each lattice plaquette that can
realistically take any value between 0 and $\pi$. We show how to take advantage
of the superlattice to ensure that each plaquette acquires the same phase, thus
simulating a uniform magnetic field. We discuss the observable consequences of
the artificial gauge field on non-interacting bosonic and fermionic gases. We
also outline how the scheme can be generalized to non-Abelian gauge fields.

the maps provides further advantages: it allows the incorporation of mixed
states of the environment as well as some initial correlation between the
system and environment, both of which are common physical situations following
excitation of the system away from thermal equilibrium. Although the approach
is not universal, in cases where it is valid it returns a complete set of

result from our first study persists: the spatial distribution of halo stars at
galactocentric distances 5--100 kpc is highly inhomogeneous. At least 20% of
halo stars within 30 kpc from the Galactic center can be statistically
associated with substructure. We present strong direct evidence, based on both
RR Lyrae stars and main sequence stars, that the halo stellar number density
profile significantly steepens beyond a Galactocentric distance of ~30 kpc, and
a larger fraction of the stars are associated with substructure. By using a
novel method that simultaneously combines data for RR Lyrae and main sequence
stars, and using photometric metallicity estimates for main sequence stars
derived from deep co-added u-band data, we measure the metallicity of the
Sagittarius dSph tidal stream (trailing arm) towards R.A.2h-3h and Dec~0 deg to
be 0.3 dex higher ([Fe/H]=-1.2) than that of surrounding halo field stars.
Together with a similar result for another major halo substructure, the
Monoceros stream, these results support theoretical predictions that an early
forming, smooth inner halo, is metal poor compared to high surface brightness
material that have been accreted onto a later-forming outer halo. The mean
metallicity of stars in the outer halo that are not associated with detectable
clumps may still be more metal-poor than the bulk of inner-halo stars, as has
been argued from other data sets.

to keep its confidential information as secret as possible from user 2. The
multiple-access channel (both the user-to-user channel and the
user-to-destination channel) is corrupted by multiplicative fading gain
coefficients in addition to additive white Gaussian noise. The channel state
information (CSI) is assumed to be known at both the users and the destination.
A parallel CMAC-CM with independent subchannels is first studied. The secrecy
capacity region of the parallel CMAC-CM is established, which yields the
secrecy capacity region of the parallel CMAC-CM with degraded subchannels.
Next, the secrecy capacity region is established for the parallel Gaussian
CMAC-CM, which is used to study the fading CMAC-CM. When both users know the
CSI, they can dynamically change their transmission powers with the channel
realization to achieve the optimal performance. The closed-form power
allocation function that achieves every boundary point of the secrecy capacity

this system we show that under generic conditions -- $L$ large, $d \geq 2$ and
isotropic interactions -- the phase transition is in fact discontinuous and
occurs at some $\theta\t < \theta^{\sharp}$. Finally, for H--stable, bounded
interactions with discontinuous transitions we show that, with suitable
scaling, the $\theta\t(L)$ tend to a definitive non--trivial limit as
$L\to\infty$.

themselves. We show that the resistivity undergoes an anomalous behavior at the
magnetic phase transition in agreement with previous theories in spite of their
numerous approximations. The origin of the resistivity peak near the phase
transition in ferromagnets is interpreted here as stemming from the existence
of magnetic domains in the critical region. This interpretation is shown to be
in consistence with previous theoretical pictures. Resistivity in a simple

difference $\theta$, it is found that the specular Andreev reflection vanishes
at $\theta=0$ while the Andreev retroreflection disappears at $\theta=\pi$.
This means that the retroreflection and specular reflection can be easily
controlled and separated in this device. In addition, due to the diffraction
effect in the narrow graphene nanoribbon, the reflected hole can exit from both
graphene terminals. As the width of nanoribbon increases, the diffraction

formation processes in the densest regions of a turbulent interstellar medium.
Clusters also have hierarchical substructure when they are young, which makes
them all look like the inner mixed parts of a pervasive stellar hierarchy.
Young field stars share this distribution, presumably because some of them came
from dissolved clusters and others formed in a dispersed fashion in the same
gas. The fraction of star formation that ends up in clusters is apparently not
constant, but may increase with interstellar pressure. Hierarchical structure
explains why stars form in clusters and why many of these clusters are
self-bound. It also explains the cluster mass function. Halo globular clusters
share many properties of disk clusters, including what appears to be an upper
cluster cutoff mass. However, halo globulars are self-enriched and often
connected with dwarf galaxy streams. The mass function of halo globulars could
have initially been like the power law mass function of disk clusters, but the
halo globulars have lost their low mass members. The reasons for this loss are
not understood. It could have happened slowly over time as a result of cluster
evaporation, or it could have happened early after cluster formation as a
result of gas loss. The latter model explains best the observation that the
globular cluster mass function has no radial gradient in galaxies.

the partial trace to one of the component spaces of the total Hilbert space,

indistinguishable identical particles. From this analogy it follows that the
indistinguishability of identical particles depends on how we define particle

  Indeed, if particles are defined by partial traces, consistent use of the
symmetry postulate leads to the conclusion that all identical particles in the
universe are indistinguishable, so that particles can never be pointed at, not
even in the classical limit. This does not correspond to the way the term
particle is actually used in practice. I will argue that a particle should be
defined in such a way that in the classical limit the quantum particle state
becomes the state of a classical particle. This will lead us to a definition of

now called the Stanley depth of an $S$-module $M$, denoted $\sdepth(M)$, and
conjectured that $\depth(M) \le \sdepth(M)$ for all finitely generated
$S$-modules $M$. This conjecture remains open for most cases. However, Herzog,
Vladoiu and Zheng recently proposed a method of attack in the case when $M = I

associates $M$ with a partially ordered set. In this paper we take advantage of
this association by using combinatorial tools to analyze squarefree Veronese
ideals in $S$. In particular, if $I_{n,d}$ is the squarefree Veronese ideal
generated by all squarefree monomials of degree $d$, we show that if $1\le d\le
n < 5d+4$, then $\sdepth(I_{n,d})= \floor{\binom{n}{d+1}\Big/\binom{n}{d}}+d$,
and if $d\geq 1$ and $n\ge 5d+4$, then $d+3\le \sdepth(I_{n,d}) \le
