Molecular Ridge, with the primary goal of identifying the coldest dense cores
possibly associated with the earliest stages of star formation. Here we present
the results from observations of the Vela-D region, covering about 4 square
degrees, in which we find 141 BLAST cores. We exploit existing data taken with
the Spitzer MIPS, IRAC and SEST-SIMBA instruments to constrain their
(single-temperature) spectral energy distributions, assuming a dust emissivity
index beta = 2.0. This combination of data allows us to determine the
temperature, luminosity and mass of each BLAST core, and also enables us to
separate starless from proto-stellar sources. We also analyze the effects that
the uncertainties on the derived physical parameters of the individual sources
have on the overall physical properties of starless and proto-stellar cores,
and we find that there appear to be a smooth transition from the pre- to the
proto-stellar phase. In particular, for proto-stellar cores we find a
correlation between the MIPS24 flux, associated with the central protostar, and
the temperature of the dust envelope. We also find that the core mass function
of the Vela-D cores has a slope consistent with other similar (sub)millimeter
surveys.

additional imaging of the region in the ACS B, V and i-bands from GOODS v2.0

selection criteria yields 6 candidates brighter than Y_AB = 27.0, of which all
except one are detected in the ACS z-band imaging and are thus unlikely to be
transients. Assuming all 6 candidates are at z~7 this implies a surface density
of objects brighter than Y_AB = 27.0 of 0.30\pm0.12 arcmin-2, a value
significantly smaller than the prediction from the z ~ 6 luminosity function.
This suggests continued evolution of the bright end of the luminosity function

last few years, with new techniques and procedures being developed at an
astonishing rate. SLS has been traditionally associated with satisfiability
solving, that is, finding a solution for a given problem instance, as its
intrinsic nature does not address unsatisfiable problems. Unsatisfiable
instances were therefore commonly solved using backtrack search solvers. For
this reason, in the late 90s Selman, Kautz and McAllester proposed a challenge
to use local search instead to prove unsatisfiability. More recently, two SLS
solvers - Ranger and Gunsat - have been developed, which are able to prove
unsatisfiability albeit being SLS solvers. In this paper, we first compare
Ranger with Gunsat and then propose to improve Ranger performance using some of
Gunsat's techniques, namely unit propagation look-ahead and extended
resolution.

unified models of particle interactions both in GUTs and in strings often in
vector-like combinations. Some of these vector-like multiplets could escape
acquiring super heavy masses and remain light down to the low energies where
they acquire vector-like masses of electroweak size. It is found that a very
small mixing of the vector-like multiplets with MSSM matter (specifically with
the third generation matter) can produce very large contributions to the
magnetic moment of the $\tau$ neutrino by as much as several orders of

include quarks. As a result, we obtain an effective model which interpolates
between hadronic and quark degrees of freedom. The new parameters and the
potential for the Polyakov loop (used as the order parameter for deconfinement)
are calibrated in order to fit lattice QCD data and reproduce the QCD phase

gravity through the inclusion of general relativity, is used to make

in the nematic phase, a traveling light ray feels an effective metric, whose
properties are linked to perpendicular and parallel refractive indexes, $n_o$ e
$n_e$ respectively, of the rod-like molecule of the liquid crystal. As these
indexes depend on the scalar order parameter of the liquid crystal, the
Beris-Edwards hydrodynamic theory is used to connect the order parameter with
the velocity of a liquid crystal flow at each point. This way we calculate a
radial velocity profile that simulates the equatorial section of the
Schwarzschild metric, in the region outside of Schwarzschild's radius, in the
nematic phase of the liquid crystal. In our model, the higher flow velocity can
be of the order of some meters per second.

Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) have revealed anomalies not
predicted by the standard inflationary cosmology. In particular, the power of
the quadrupole moment of the CMB fluctuations is remarkably low, and the
quadrupole and octopole moments are aligned mutually and with the geometry of
the Solar system. It has been suggested in the literature that microwave sky
pollution by an unidentified dust cloud in the vicinity of the Solar system may
be the cause for these anomalies. In this paper, we simulate the thermal
emission by clouds of spherical homogeneous particles of several materials.
Spectral constraints from the WMAP multi-wavelength data and earlier infrared
observations on the hypothetical dust cloud are used to determine the dust
cloud's physical characteristics. In order for its emissivity to demonstrate a
flat, CMB-like wavelength dependence over the WMAP wavelengths (3 through 14
mm), and to be invisible in the infrared light, its particles must be
macroscopic. Silicate spheres from several millimetres in size and carbonaceous
particles an order of magnitude smaller will suffice. According to our
estimates of the abundance of such particles in the Zodiacal cloud and
trans-neptunian belt, yielding the optical depths of the order of 1E-7 for each
cloud, the Solar-system dust can well contribute 10 microKelvin (within an
order of magnitude) in the microwaves. This is not only intriguingly close to
the magnitude of the anomalies (about 30 microKelvin), but also alarmingly
above the presently believed magnitude of systematic biases of the WMAP results
(below 5 microKelvin) and, to an even greater degree, of the future missions
with higher sensitivities, e.g. PLANCK.

subgroups. However, if one restricts attention to abelian groups then not all
entropy vectors can be obtained. This is an explanation for the fact shown by
Dougherty et al that linear network codes cannot achieve capacity in general
network coding problems (since linear network codes form an abelian group). All
abelian group-characterizable vectors, and by fiat all entropy vectors
generated by linear network codes, satisfy a linear inequality called the
Ingleton inequality. In this paper, we study the problem of finding nonabelian
finite groups that yield characterizable vectors which violate the Ingleton
inequality. Using a refined computer search, we find the symmetric group S_5 to
be the smallest group that violates the Ingleton inequality. Careful study of
the structure of this group, and its subgroups, reveals that it belongs to the
Ingleton-violating family PGL(2,p) with primes p > 3, i.e., the projective
group of 2 by 2 nonsingular matrices with entries in F_p. This family of groups
is therefore a good candidate for constructing network codes more powerful than
linear network codes.

unified theory. In the model, we employ an SU(2)F flavor symmetry and an
anomalous U(1)A symmetry. The SU(2)F flavor symmetry is introduced to provide
the origin of hierarchical structures of Yukawa coupling and to ensure the
universality of sfermion soft masses. The anomalous U(1)A symmetry is
introduced to realize the doublet-triplet mass splitting, to provide the origin
of hierarchical structures of Yukawa couplings, and to solve the mu problem. In
the model, CP is spontaneously broken by the SU(2)F breaking in order to
provide a Kobayashi-Maskawa phase and to evade the supersymmetric CP problem.
However, a naive construction of the model generally leads to unwanted outcome,
Arg[mu b*]=O(1), when CP violating effects in the flavor sector are taken into
account. We cure this difficulty by imposing a discrete symmetry and find that
this prescription can play additional roles. It ensures that realistic up-quark
mass and Cabibbo angle are simultaneously realized without cancellation between
O(1) coefficients. Also, severe constraints from the chromo-electric dipole
moment of the quark can be satisfied without destabilizing the weak scale. The
discrete symmetry reduces the number of free parameters, but the model is
capable of reproducing quark and lepton mass spectra, mixing angles, and a
Jarlskog invariant. We obtain characteristic predictions Vub sim O(lambda^4)
(lambda=0.22) and |Vcb Yb| = |Yc| at the grand unified theory scale.

modern condensed matter physics. A central example in the field of mesoscopic
physics is the localization-delocalization (metal-insulator) quantum phase
transition driven by disorder -- the Anderson transition. Although the notion
of localization has appeared half a century ago, this field is still full of
surprising new developments. The most recent arenas where novel peculiar
localization phenomena have been studied are graphene and topological
insulators, i.e., bulk insulators with delocalized (topologically protected)
states on their surface. Besides exciting physical properties, the topological
protection renders such systems promising candidates for a variety of
prospective electronic and spintronic devices. It is thus of crucial importance
to understand properties of boundary metallic modes in the realistic systems
when both disorder and interaction are present. Here we find a novel critical
state which emerges in the bulk of two-dimensional quantum spin Hall (QSH)
systems and on the surface of three-dimensional topological insulators with
strong spin-orbit interaction due to the interplay of nontrivial Z_2 topology
and the Coulomb repulsion. At low temperatures, this state possesses a
universal value of electrical conductivity. In particular, we predict that the
direct QSH phase transition occurs via this novel state. Remarkably, the
interaction-induced critical state emerges on the surface of a
three-dimensional topological insulator without any adjustable parameters. This
``self-organized quantum criticality'' is a novel concept in the field of
interacting disordered systems.

limit, i.e., neglecting atmospheric motions. We argue that hot Jupiter
atmospheres, with possibly fast (sonic) wind speeds, may require a more
strongly coupled treatment, formally in the regime of radiation-hydrodynamics.
To lowest order in v/c, relativistic Doppler shifts distort line profiles along
optical paths with finite wind velocity gradients. This leads to flow-dependent
deviations in the effective emission and absorption properties of the
atmospheric medium. Evaluating the overall impact of these distortions on the
radiative structure of a dynamic atmosphere is non-trivial. We present
transmissivity and systematic equivalent width excess calculations which
suggest possibly important consequences for radiation transport in hot Jupiter
atmospheres. If winds are fast and bulk Doppler shifts are indeed important for
the global radiative balance, accurate modeling and reliable data
interpretation for hot Jupiter atmospheres may prove challenging: it would
involve anisotropic and dynamic radiative transfer in a coupled
radiation-hydrodynamical flow. On the bright side, it would also imply that the
emergent properties of hot Jupiter atmospheres are more direct tracers of their
atmospheric flows than is the case for Solar System planets.
Radiation-hydrodynamics may also influence radiative transfer in other classes
of hot exoplanetary atmospheres with fast winds.

  The removal of a significant foreground contamination using newly acquired
Stromgren photometry has resulted in a reduced velocity dispersion. Using this
new velocity dispersion of 3.72 +/- 0.91 km/s, we find a mass of
M_300=1.9^{+1.1}_{-0.8} 10^6 M_sun within the central 300 pc, which is also the
half-light radius, and a mass of M_433=3.7_{-1.6}^{+2.2} 10^6 M_sun within the
reach of our data to 433 pc, significantly lower than previous estimates. We
derive an overall mass-to-light ratio of M_433/L=103^{+83}_{-48} M_sun/L_sun.
Our mass estimate calls into question recent claims of a common mass scale for
dSph galaxies.
  Additionally, we find tentative evidence for a velocity gradient in our
kinematic data of 16 +/- 3 km/s/kpc, and evidence of an asymmetric extension in
the light distribution at about 0.5 kpc. We explore the possibility that these
features are due to tidal interactions with the Milky Way. We show that there
is a self-consistent model in which Hercules has an assumed tidal radius of r_t
= 485 pc, an orbital pericentre of r_p = 18.5 +/- 5 kpc, and a mass within r_t
of M_{tid,r_t}=5.2 +/- 2.7 10^6 M_sun. Proper motions are required to test this
model. Although we cannot exclude models in which Hercules contains no dark
matter, we argue that Hercules is more likely to be a dark matter dominated
system which is currently experiencing some tidal disturbance of its outer
parts.

sizes, and densities similar to the excess-light/central-cusps seen in typical

the DCOs form in present-day examples of the dissipative mergers at high

ellipticals. More generally, the properties of the LBAs are consistent with the
idea that instabilities in a gas-rich disk lead to very massive star-forming
clumps that eventually coalesce to form a spheroid. We speculate that the DCOs

the large scale (<1 Mpc) environment of Sy1, Sy2 and Bright IRAS galaxies and
their respective control samples (Koulouridis et al.). The results led us to
the conclusion that a close encounter appears capable of activating a sequence
where a normal galaxy becomes first a starburst, then a Sy2 and finally a Sy1
galaxy. However since both galaxies of an interacting pair should be affected,
we present here optical spectroscopy and X-ray imaging of the neighbouring
galaxies around our Seyfert and BIRG galaxy samples. We find that more than 70%
of all neighbouring galaxies exhibit thermal or/and nuclear activity (namely
enhanced star formation, starbursting and/or AGN) and furthermore we discovered
various trends regarding the type and strength of the neighbour's activity with
respect to the activity of the central galaxy, the most important of which is
that the neighbours of Sy2 are systematically more ionized, and their straburst
is younger, than the neighbours of Sy1s. Our results not only strengthen the
link between close galaxy interactions and activity but also provide more clues
regarding the evolutionary sequence inferred by previous results.

source HLX1, possibly located in the S0-a galaxy ESO243-49, but the lack of an
identifiable optical counterpart had hampered its interpretation. Using the
Magellan telescope, we have discovered an unresolved optical source with R =

circle. This implies an average X-ray/optical flux ratio ~ 500. Taking the same
distance as ESO243-49, we obtain an intrinsic brightness M_R = (-11.0 +/- 0.3)
mag, comparable to that of a massive globular cluster. Alternatively, the
optical source is consistent with a main-sequence M star in the Galactic halo
(for example an M4.4 star at ~ 2.5 kpc). We also examined the properties of
ESO243-49 by combining Swift/UVOT observations with stellar population
modelling. We found that the overall emission is dominated by a ~5 Gyr old
stellar population, but the UV emission at ~2000 Ang is mostly due to ongoing
star-formation at a rate of ~ 0.03 Msun/yr. The UV emission is more intense (at
least a 9-sigma enhancement above the mean) North East of the nucleus, in the
same quadrant as HLX1. With the combined optical and X-ray measurements, we put
constraints on the nature of HLX1. We rule out a foreground star and a
background AGN. Two alternative scenarios are still viable. HLX1 could be an
accreting intermediate-mass black hole in a star cluster, which may itself be
the stripped nucleus of a dwarf galaxy that passed through ESO243-49, an event
which might have caused the current episode of star formation. Or, it could be
a neutron star in the Galactic halo, accreting from an M4-M5 donor star.

have been put forward. Most of them focus on specific data, depending on strong

  Some authors hinted - implicitly - that the two most important

and scatter.
  In a first part, we prove two theorems, making up a formal version of this
intuition: scattered and regular r.v.'s do approximately follow Benford's law.
The proofs only need simple mathematical tools, making the analysis easy.
Previous explanations thus become corollaries of a more general and simpler
one.
  These results suggest that Benford's law does not depend on properties linked

bispectrum, whose amplitude is given by the fNL parameter, offers a powerful
test of inflation. In this paper we calculate the modification of two-point
cross-correlation statistics of weak lensing - galaxy-galaxy lensing and
galaxy-Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) cross-correlation - due to fNL. We
derive and calculate the covariance matrix of galaxy-galaxy lensing including
cosmic variance terms. We focus on large scales (l<100) for which the shape
noise of the shear measurement becomes irrelevant and cosmic variance dominates
the error budget. For a modest degree of non-Gaussianity, fNL=+/-50,
modifications of the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal at the 10% level are seen on
scales R~300 Mpc, and grow rapidly toward larger scales as \propto R^2. We also
see a clear signature of the baryonic acoustic oscillation feature in the
matter power spectrum at ~150 Mpc, which can be measured by next-generation
lensing experiments. In addition we can probe the local-form primordial
non-Gaussianity in the galaxy-CMB lensing signal by correlating the lensing
potential reconstructed from CMB with high-z galaxies. For example, for
fNL=+/-50, we find that the galaxy-CMB lensing cross power spectrum is modified
by ~10% at l~40, and by a factor of two at l~10, for a population of galaxies
at z=2 with a bias of 2. The effect is greater for more highly biased
populations at larger z; thus, high-z galaxy surveys cross-correlated with CMB
offer a yet another probe of primordial non-Gaussianity.

observed differences between samples are consistent with orientation-based
unification schemes. The type-1 objects show significant emission at 3 micron.
They do not show strong PAH emission and have less far-IR emission on average
when compared to the type-2 objects. The SEDs of the type-2 objects show a wide
assortment of silicate features, ranging from weak emission to deep silicate
absorption. Some also show strong PAH features. In comparison, silicate is only
seen in emission in the type-1 objects. This is consistent with some of the
type-2s being reddened by a foreground screen of cooler dust, perhaps in the
host galaxy itself. We investigate the AGN contribution to the far-IR emission
and find it to be significant. We also estimate the star formation rate for
each of the objects by integrating the modeled far-IR flux and compare this
with the SFR found from PAH emission. We find the type-2 quasars have a higher
average SFR than the type-1 quasars based on both methods, though this could be

pronounced differences between the two types of objects, none of them are

by imposing three requirements: 1) Hamilton action should be reparametrization

spinor phase should be a cyclic variable. In more detail are discussed those of
the the Lagrangians which depend on the spinor's null vector and its worldline.
An interesting relation between a Hessian determinant and Casimir invariants
for such objects leads to the conclusion that no fundamental objects of this
kind exist with worldlines uniquely determinable from the Hamilton action and
the initial conditions. This unexpected result poses the general question about
existence of classical fundamental dynamical systems with well posed Cauchy

we describe the formation of high-$z$ ($z > 6$) quasars (QSOs) whose BH masses
are M_{BH}> 10^{9} M_{\odot}. We derive the necessary conditions to form QSOs
at z > 6 by only gas accretion: (i) A large mass supply with M_{sup} >
10^{10}M_{\odot} from host galaxies to CNDs, because the final BH mass is only
1-10% of the total supplied mass from QSO hosts. (ii) High star formation
efficiency for a rapid BH growth. We also find that if the BH growth is limited
by the Eddington accretion, the final BH mass is greatly suppressed. Thus, the
super-Eddington growth is required for the QSO formation. The evolution of the
QSO luminosity depends on the redshift z_{i} at which accretion onto a seed BH
is initiated. In other words, the brighter QSOs at z >6 favor the late growth
of SMBHs (i.e., z_{i}=10) rather than early growth (i.e., z_{i}=30). Moreover,
we predict the observable properties and the evolution of QSOs at z >6. In a
QSO phase, there should exist a stellar rich massive CND, whose gas mass is
about 10% of the dynamical mass inside 0.1-1 kpc}. On the other hand, in a
phase where the BH grows (i.e., a proto-QSO phase), the proto-QSO has a gas
rich massive CNDs whose gas mass is comparable to the dynamical mass
(abridged).

Detailed study of in situ density profiles shows that, first, locally adiabatic
ramps do not guarantee global thermal equilibrium. Indeed, full thermalization
for typical parameters only occurs for experiment times which exceed one
second. Secondly, ramping non-adiabatically to the Mott insulator regime can
result in strong localized cooling at short times and global cooling once
equilibrated. For an initial temperature estimated as 20 nK, we observe local
temperatures as low as 1.5 nK, and a final global temperature of 9 nK. Possible
cooling mechanisms include adiabatic decompression, modification of the density
of states near the quantum critical regime, and the Joule-Thomson effect.

question by studying the turbulent energy spectrum in NGC 1333. Using synthetic
13CO maps computed with a snapshot of a supersonic turbulence simulation, we
show that the VCS method of Lazarian and Pogosyan provides an accurate estimate
of the turbulent energy spectrum. We then apply this method to the 13CO map of
NGC 1333 from the COMPLETE database. We find the turbulent energy spectrum is a
power law, E(k) k^-beta, in the range of scales 0.06 pc < ell < 1.5 pc, with
slope beta=1.85\pm 0.04. The estimated energy injection scale of stellar
outflows in NGC 1333 is ell_inj 0.3 pc, well resolved by the observations.
There is no evidence of the flattening of the energy spectrum above the scale
ell_inj predicted by outflow-driven simulations and analytical models. The
power spectrum of integrated intensity is also a nearly perfect power law in
the range of scales 0.16 pc < ell < 7.9 pc, with no feature above ell_inj. We
conclude that the observed turbulence in NGC 1333 does not appear to be driven

recently proposed as a regularization of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes

kinematic viscosity parameter, $\nu>0$, this model possesses a regularizing
parameter, $\alpha> 0$, a given length scale parameter, so that
$\frac{\alpha^2}{\nu}$ is the relaxation time of the viscoelastic fluid. In
this work, we derive several statistical properties of the invariant measures
associated with the solutions of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes-Voigt
equations. Moreover, we prove that, for fixed viscosity, $\nu>0$, as the
regularizing parameter $\alpha$ tends to zero, there exists a subsequence of
probability invariant measures converging, in a suitable sense, to a strong
stationary statistical solution of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes
equations, which is a regularized version of the notion of stationary
statistical solutions - a generalization of the concept of invariant measure
introduced and investigated by Foias. This fact supports earlier numerical
observations, and provides an additional evidence that, for small values of the
regularization parameter $\alpha$, the Navier-Stokes-Voigt model can indeed be
considered as a model to study the statistical properties of the
three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations and turbulent flows via direct

spent on the discussion of special cases. For example, when the analysis
considers the cases X<Y and X>Y separately, one might have to be especially
careful about what happens when X=Y. On the other hand, experience tells us
that when a yet unregarded special case of this kind is discovered, one nearly
always finds a way to handle it. This is typically done by modifying the
analysis and/or the algorithm very slightly.
  In this article we substantiate this observation theoretically. We
concentrate on deterministic algorithms for weighted combinatorial optimization
problems. A problem instance of this kind is defined by its structure and a
vector of weights. The concept of a null case is introduced as set of problem
instances whose weight vectors constitute a nowhere open set (or null set) in
the space of all possible weight configurations. An algorithm is called robust
if any null case can be disregarded in the analysis of both its solution
quality and resource requirements.
  We show that achieving robustness is only a matter of breaking ties the right
way. More specifically, we show that the concept of symbolic perturbation known
from the area of geometric algorithms guarantees that no surprises will happen
in null cases. We argue that for a huge class of combinatorial optimization
algorithms it is easy to verify that they implicitly use symbolic perturbation
for breaking ties and thus can be analyzed under the assumption that some
arbitrary null case never occurs. Finally, we prove that there exists a
symbolic perturbation tie breaking policy for any algorithm.

the crater counts on Mariner 10 images of the highlands and of several large

size by successive element deletion (e.g. edge collapses) with the goal of
geometric and topological feature preservation. The choice of geometric error
used to guide the reduction process is chosen independent of the function the
end user aims to calculate, analyze, or adaptively refine. In this paper, we
argue that such a decoupling of structure from function modeling is often
unwise as small changes in geometry may cause large changes in the associated
function. A stable approach to mesh decimation, therefore, ought to be guided
primarily by an analysis of functional sensitivity, a property dependent on
both the particular application and the equations used for computation (e.g.
integrals, derivatives, or integral/partial differential equations). We present
a methodology to elucidate the geometric sensitivity of functionals via two
major functional discretization techniques: Galerkin finite element and
discrete exterior calculus. A number of examples are given to illustrate the
methodology and provide numerical examples to further substantiate our choices.

(both pseudoscalar and vector) can still be proved in the leading order in
$m_D/m_B$ and $\Lambda_{\rm{QCD}}/m_D$ expansion. Working in the perturbative
QCD approach, we find that the factorizable emission diagrams are dominant.
Most of branching ratios we compute agree with the experimental data well,
which means that the factorization theorem seems to be reliable in predicting
branching ratios for these decays. In the decays of a $B$ meson to two vector
charmed mesons, the transverse polarization states contribute $40%-50%$ both in
the processes with an external W emission and in the pure annihilation decays.
This is in agreement with the present experimental data. We also calculate the
CP asymmetry parameters. The results show that the direct CP asymmetries are
very small. Thus observation of any large direct CP asymmetry will be a signal
for new physics. The mixing induced CP asymmetry in the neutral modes is large.
This is also in agreement with the current experimental measurements. They can
give a cross check of the $\sin 2\beta$ measurement from other channels.

fermions. The main issue is to cope with kinetic-like, momentum (p^2) dependent
effective interactions that arise at this order. They spoil the unitarity of
the connection between flavor and mass states, which potentially alters the
standard Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) phenomenology by giving rise, in
particular, to extra flavor changing neutral currents (FCNC). We explore the
conservative requirement that these should be suppressed, which yields
relations between the CKM angles, the fermion and $W$ masses, and a
renormalization scale $\mu$. For two generations, two solutions arise: either
the mixing angle of the fermion pair the closer to degeneracy is close to
maximal while, inversely, the mass and flavor states of the other pair are
quasi-aligned, or mixing angles in both sectors are very small. For three
generations, all mixing angles of neutrinos are predicted to be large
(theta_{23}, close to maximal, is the largest) and the smallness of their mass
differences induces mass-flavor quasi-alignment for all charged leptons. The
hadronic sector differs in that the top quark is twice as heavy as the W. The
situation is, there, bleaker, as all angles come out too large, but,
nevertheless, encouraging, because theta_{12} decreases as the top mass
increases. Whether other super-heavy fermions could drag it down to realistic
values stays an open issue, together with the role of higher order corrections.
The same type of counterterms that turned off the 4th order static corrections
to the quark electric dipole moment are, here too, needed, in particular to
stabilize quantum corrections to mixing angles.

  Hardness-randomness tradeoffs will also be shown in the converse direction,
in an effort to make progress on Valiant's VP versus VNP problem. To separate
VP and VNP, it is known to be sufficient to prove that the determinantal
complexity of the m-by-m permanent is $m^{\omega(\log m)}$. In this paper it is
shown, for an appropriate notion of explicitness, that the existence of an
explicit multilinear polynomial family with determinantal complexity
m^{\omega(\log m)}$ is equivalent to the existence of an efficiently computable
generator $G_n$ for multilinear NSMC with seed length $O(n^{1/\sqrt{\log n}})$.
The latter is a combinatorial object that provides an efficient deterministic
black-box algorithm for NSMC. ``Multilinear NSMC'' indicates that $G_n$ only

  pages)",,,,"hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A lot of developments made during the last years show that Kac-Moody algebras
play an important role in the algebraic structure of some supergravity
theories. These algebras would generate infinite-dimensional symmetry groups.
The possible existence of such symmetries have motivated the reformulation of
these theories as non-linear sigma-models based on the Kac-Moody symmetry
groups. Such models are constructed in terms of an infinite number of fields
parametrizing the generators of the corresponding algebra. If these conjectured
symmetries are indeed actual symmetries of certain supergravity theories, a
meaningful question to elucidate will be the interpretation of this infinite
tower of fields. Another substantial problem is to find the correspondence
between the sigma-models, which are explicitly invariant under the conjectured
symmetries, and these corresponding space-time theories. The subject of this
thesis is to address these questions in certain cases.

larger than those expected from stellar evolution. In order to study these
period and amplitude changes, a few selected stars are measured photometrically
for hundreds of nights with a dedicated telescope. These measurements cover
several years or decades. The Delta Scuti stars provide more information (than
classical pulsators) since a number of simultaneously excited radial and
nonradial modes can be studied. The present results indicate the presence of at
least two effects: beating of independent modes with close frequencies and
stellar cycles. For period and amplitude changes with time scales less than one
year, we confirm the beating hypothesis in three stars. This is shown by the
correctly correlated relationship between amplitude and phase changes as well
as the repetitions of these cycles. However, the observed period variations
with longer time scales are not due to simple beating between two close
frequencies. For the star 4 CVn we can derive accurate annual frequency values
for at least seven radial and nonradial modes. The annual phases are in
excellent agreement with predictions from nearby years, thereby confirming the
values and their observed long-term changes. For prograde and retrograde modes,
the period variations are of identical size, but with opposite signs. The
radial mode shows no (or little) changes. Furthermore, all period variations
show a reversal around 1990. These results suggest long-term, regular cycles
affecting individual modes differently with some common systematic behavior.

characterized as a multivariate, binary, longitudinal (MBL) dataset with a

largest value of the temperature parameter for this to occur, since the higher
the temperature, the faster the mixing. This is in contrast to simulated
annealing techniques where, rather than being held fixed, the temperature
parameter is tended to zero. Simulations suggest that the resulting Gibbs
sampler provides a computationally efficient way of achieving approximative ML
detection in MIMO systems having a huge number of transmit and receive

the topological derivatives of shape functionals are obtained for

characteristics of voids. The distinguished feature of the piezoelectricity
boundary value problems under considerations is the absence of positive
definiteness of an differential operator which is non self-adjoint. Two
specific Gibbs' functionals of the problem are defined by the energy and the
electric enthalpy. The topological derivatives are defined in different manners
for each of the governing functionals. Actually, the topological derivative of
the enthalpy functional is local i.e., defined by the pointwise values of the

spanning tree method (the Q parameter, which enables one to classify the star
distribution as either radially or fractally clustered), King profile fitting,
and the correlation dimension (Dc) for those clusters with fractal patterns. On
average, clusters with fractal-like structure are younger than those exhibiting
radial star density profiles. There is a significant correlation between Q and
the cluster age measured in crossing time units. For fractal clusters there is
a significant correlation between the fractal dimension and age. These results
support the idea that stars in new-born clusters likely follow the fractal
patterns of their parent molecular clouds, and eventually evolve toward more
centrally concentrated structures. However, there can exist stellar clusters as
old as 100 Myr that have not totally destroyed their fractal structure.
Finally, we have found the intriguing result that the lowest fractal dimensions
obtained for the open clusters seem to be considerably smaller than the average
value measured in galactic molecular cloud complexes.

its performance and its more widespread use. The models parsimoniously describe
the expression of thousands of genes with a small number of hyper-parameters.
This makes them easy to interpret and analytically tractable. The first model
is a simple extension that improves the fit substantially with almost no
increase in complexity. We propose a second extension that uses a mixture of
gamma distributions to further improve the fit, at the expense of increased
computational burden. We derive several approximations that significantly
reduce the computational cost. We find that our models outperform the original

differential expression analysis. The improved performance is specially
noticeable for the small sample sizes commonly encountered in high-throughput

intranight optical variability (INOV) detection threshold of $\sim$ 1--2% was
achieved for the densely sampled differential light curves (DLCs). These
observations amount to a large increase over those reported hitherto for this
rare and sparsely studied class of quasars which can, however, play an
important role in understanding the link between the dominant varieties of
powerful AGN, namely the radio-quiet quasars (RQQs), radio-loud quasars (RLQs)
and blazars. Despite the probable presence of relativistically boosted nuclear
jets, clear evidence for INOV in our extensive observations was detected only
on one night. These results demonstrate that as a class, RIQs are much less
extreme in nuclear activity compared to blazars. The availability in the
literature of INOV data for another 2 RIQs conforming to our selection criteria
allowed us to enlarge the sample to 10 RIQs (monitored on a total of 42 nights
for a minimum duration of $\sim 4$ hours per night). The absence of large
amplitude INOV $(\psi > 3%)$ persists in this enlarged sample. This extensive
database has enabled us to arrive at the first estimate for the INOV Duty Cycle
(DC) of RIQs. The DC is found to be small ($\sim$ 9%). The corresponding value
is known to be $\sim 60%$ for BL Lacs and $\approx 15%$ for RLQs and RQQs. On
longer-term, the RIQs are found to be fairly variable with typical amplitudes
of $\approx$ 0.1-mag. The light curves of these RIQs are briefly discussed in
the context of a theoretical framework proposed earlier for linking this rare

fundamental one, especially for planets orbiting M stars due to the star's
long-duration active phase and corresponding potential for stellar-induced
planetary atmospheric escape and erosion. Tidally-locked planets with no
atmosphere are expected to show a Lambertian-like thermal phase curve, causing
the combined light of the planet-star system to vary with planet orbital phase.
  We report Spitzer 8 micron IRAC observations of GJ 876 taken over 32
continuous hours and reaching a relative photometric precision of 3.9e-04 per
point for 25.6 s time sampling. This translates to a 3 sigma limit of 5.13e-05
on a planet thermal phase curve amplitude. Despite the almost photon-noise
limited data, we are unable to conclusively infer the presence of an atmosphere
or rule one out on the non-transiting short-period super Earth GJ 876d. The
limiting factor in our observations was the miniscule, monotonic photometric
variation of the slightly active host M star, because the partial sine wave due
to the planet has a component in common with the stellar linear trend. The
proposed method is nevertheless very promising for transiting hot super Earths
with the James Webb Space Telescope and is critical for establishing
observational constraints for atmospheric escape.

to keep the information secret from a relay node despite wanting to enlist its
help. For this scenario, an interesting question is whether the relay node
should be deployed at all. That is, whether cooperation with an untrusted relay
node can ever be beneficial. We first provide an achievable secrecy rate for
the general untrusted relay channel, and proceed to investigate this question
for two types of relay networks with orthogonal components. For the first
model, there is an orthogonal link from the source to the relay. For the second
model, there is an orthogonal link from the relay to the destination. For the
first model, we find the equivocation capacity region and show that answer is
negative. In contrast, for the second model, we find that the answer is
positive. Specifically, we show by means of the achievable secrecy rate based
on compress-and-forward, that, by asking the untrusted relay node to relay
information, we can achieve a higher secrecy rate than just treating the relay
as an eavesdropper. For a special class of the second model, where the relay is
not interfering itself, we derive an upper bound for the secrecy rate using an
argument whose net effect is to separate the eavesdropper from the relay. The
merit of the new upper bound is demonstrated on two channels that belong to
this special class. The Gaussian case of the second model mentioned above
benefits from this approach in that the new upper bound improves the previously
known bounds. For the Cover-Kim deterministic relay channel, the new upper
bound finds the secrecy capacity when the source-destination link is not worse
than the source-relay link, by matching with the achievable rate we present.

The DFs depend on action variables and their predictions for observable

promising family of DFs is defined that has several adjustable parameters. A
standard DF is identified by adjusting these parameters to optimise fits to the
stellar density in the column above the Sun, and to the velocity distribution
of nearby stars and stars ~1 kpc above the Sun. The optimum parameters imply a
radial structure for the disc which is consistent with photometric studies of
the Milky Way and similar galaxies, and that 20 per cent of the disc's
luminosity comes from thick disc. The fits suggest that the value of the V
component of the Sun's peculiar velocity should be revised upwards from 5.2
km/s to ~11 km/s. It is argued that the standard DF provides a significantly
more reliable way to divide solar-neighbourhood stars into members of the thin
and thick discs than is currently used. The standard DF provides predictions
for surveys of stars observed at any distance from the Sun. It is anticipated
that DFs of the type discussed here will provide useful starting points for

replacing one minimal model plus the superfluous E_8 factor by a
non-supersymmetric CFT with identical modular properties. This CFT generically
lifts the weights in the bosonic sector, giving rise to a spectrum with fewer
massless states. We identify more than 30 such lifts, and we expect many more
to exist. This yields more than 450 different combinations. Remarkably, despite
the lifting of all Ramond states, it is still possible to get chiral spectra.
Even more surprisingly, these chiral spectra include examples with a certain
number of chiral families of SO(10), SU(5) or other subgroups, including just
SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1). The number of families and mirror families is typically
smaller than in standard Gepner models. Furthermore, in a large number of
different cases, spectra with three chiral families can be obtained. Based on a
first scan of about 10% of the lifted Gepner models we can construct, we have
collected more than 10.000 distinct spectra with three families, including
examples without mirror fermions. We present an example where the GUT group is

fractionally charged particles are confined by an additional gauge group
