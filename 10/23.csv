quantum walks. These techniques have two main applications: simulating sparse
Hamiltonians and implementing black-box unitary operations. In particular, we
give the best known simulation of sparse Hamiltonians with constant precision.
Our method has complexity linear in both the sparseness D (the maximum number
of nonzero elements in a column) and the evolution time t, whereas previous
methods had complexity scaling as D^4 and were superlinear in t. We also
consider the task of implementing an arbitrary unitary operation given a
black-box description of its matrix elements. Whereas standard methods for
performing an explicitly specified N x N unitary operation use O(N^2)
elementary gates, we show that a black-box unitary can be performed with
bounded error using O(N^{2/3} (log log N)^{4/3}) queries to its matrix
elements. In fact, except for pathological cases, it appears that most
unitaries can be performed with only O(sqrt{N}) queries, which is optimal.

long lived particles (LOLIPs) that subsequently decay into SM states. Such
particles are many cases indistinguishable from missing transverse energy (MET)
at colliders. We propose new methods to search for these particles using
neutrino telescopes. We study their detection prospects, assuming production
either at the LHC or through dark matter (DM) annihilations in the Sun and the
Earth. We find that the sensitivity for LOLIPs produced at the LHC is limited
by luminosity and detection energy thresholds. On the other hand, in the case
of DM annihilation into LOLIPs, the sensitivity of neutrino telescopes is
promising and may extend beyond the reach of upcoming direct detection
experiments. In the context of low scale hidden sectors weakly coupled to the
SM, such indirect searches allow to probe couplings as small as 10^-15.

some other protocol properties. The strand space model is a framework for
design and verification of cryptographic protocols. A strand is a local
behavior of a single principal in a single session of a protocol. A bundle is a
partially ordered global execution built from protocol strands and adversary
activities. The strand space model needs two additions for fair exchange
protocols. First, we regard the state as a multiset of facts, and we allow
strands to cause changes in this state via multiset rewriting. Second, progress
assumptions stipulate that some channels are resilient-and guaranteed to
deliver messages-and some principals are assumed not to stop at certain
critical steps. This method leads to proofs of correctness that cleanly
separate protocol properties, such as authentication and confidentiality, from
invariants governing state evolution. G. Wang's recent fair exchange protocol
illustrates the approach.

attention of investigators studying the release of flame trench fire bricks
because its high trajectory could indicate a flight risk to the Space Shuttle.
Digitized images from two pad perimeter high-speed 16-mm film cameras were
processed using photogrammetry software based on a multi-parameter optimization
technique. Reference points in the image were found from 3D CAD models of the
launch pad and from surveyed points on the pad. The three-dimensional reference
points were matched to the equivalent two-dimensional camera projections by
optimizing the camera model parameters using a gradient search optimization
technique. Using this method of solving the triangulation problem, the xyz
position of the object's path relative to the reference point coordinate system
was found for every set of synchronized images. This trajectory was then
compared to a predicted trajectory while performing regression analysis on the
ballistic coefficient and other parameters. This identified, with a high degree
of confidence, the object's material density and thus its probable origin
within the launch pad environment. Future extensions of this methodology may
make it possible to diagnose the underlying causes of debris-releasing events

~0.3 for poorer clusters. Based on Terapix T05 release gri photometric

especially the latter, are being searched for gravitational lenses -- one of

only conduction band of electron-doped layer and valence band of hole-doped

coupling, an ultrarelativistic character of electron dynamics reveals and the
bands which are remote from Fermi surfaces (valence band of electron-doped

pairing. The analysis of instability of unpaired state shows that s-wave
pairing with band-diagonal condensate structure, described by two gaps, is
preferable. A relative phase of the gaps is fixed, however at weak coupling
this fixation diminishes allowing gapped and soliton-like excitations. The
coupled self-consistent gap equations for these two gaps are solved at zero
temperature in the constant-gap approximation and in the approximation of
separable potential. It is shown that, if characteristic width of the pairing
region is of the order of magnitude of chemical potential, then the value of
the gap in the spectrum is not much different from the BCS estimation. However,
if the pairing region is wider, then the gap value can be much larger and

highest known redshift in the Universe. By combining our radio measurements
with existing X-ray and infrared observations, we estimate the kinetic energy
of the afterglow, the geometry of the outflow and the density of the
circumburst medium. Our best fit model is a quasi-spherical, high-energy
explosion in a low, constant-density medium. \event had a similar energy
release to the other well-studied high redshift GRB 050904 ($z=6.26$), but
their circumburst densities differ by two orders of magnitude. We compare the
properties of \event with a sample of GRBs at moderate redshifts. We find that
the high energy and afterglow properties of \event are not sufficiently
different from other GRBs to suggest a different kind of progenitor, such as a
Population III star. However, we argue that it is not clear that the afterglow
properties alone can provide convincing identification of Population III
progenitors. We suggest that the millimeter and centimeter radio detections of
\event at early times contained emission from a reverse shock component. This
has important implications for the detection of high redshift GRBs by the next
generation of radio facilities.

hyperbolic characteristics due to the effect of the random perturbed field. As

may be rigorously defined as a solution of a nonlinear inverse scattering
problem. In this respect the problems of S-parameter retrieval, effective
medium theory, and even the derivation of the macroscopic electrodynamics
itself, turn out to be all mathematically equivalent. We confirm analytically
and observe numerically effects that were previously reported in the
one-dimensional strongly inhomogeneous slabs: the non-uniqueness of the
effective permittivity and its dependence on the illumination and observation
conditions, and the geometry of the object. Moreover, we show that, although
the S-parameter retrieval of the effective permittivity is scale-free at the
level of problem statement, the exact solution of this problem either does not
exist or is not unique. Using the results from the spectral analysis we
describe the set of values of the effective permittivity for which the
scattering problem is ill-posed. Unfortunately, real nonpositive values,
important for negative refraction and invisibility, belong to this set. We
illustrate our conclusions using a numerical reduced-order inverse scattering
algorithm specifically designed for the effective permittivity problem.

was allowed to change producing galaxies with different morphologies. The
presence of baryons produces the concentration of the DM halo with respect to
its corresponding dissipationless run, but we found that this response does not
only depend on the amount of baryons gathered in the central region but also on
the way they have been assembled. DM and baryons affect each other in a complex
way so the formation history of a galaxy plays an important role on its final
total mass distribution. Supernova (SN) feedback regulates the star formation
and triggers galactic outflows not only in the central galaxy but also in its
satellites. Our results suggest that, as the effects of SN feedback get
stronger, satellites get less massive and can even be more easily disrupted by
dynamical friction, transferring less angular momentum. We found indications
that this angular momentum could be acquired not only by the outer part of the
DM halo but also by the inner ones and by the stellar component in the central
galaxy. The latter effect produces stellar migration which contributes to
change the inner potential well, probably working against further DM
contraction. As a consequence of the action of these processes, when the halo
hosts a galaxy with an important disc structure formed by smooth gas accretion,
it is more concentrated than when it hosts a spheroidal system which
experienced more massive mergers and interactions. (abridged)

triggered an intense effort to better understand the particle acceleration,
absorption, and emission mechanisms in compact binary systems, which provide
variable conditions along eccentric orbits. Despite this, the nature of some of
these systems, and of the accelerated particles producing the VHE emission, is
unclear. To answer some of these open questions, we conducted a multiwavelength
campaign of the VHE gamma-ray emitting X-ray binary LS I +61 303 including the
MAGIC telescope, XMM-Newton, and Swift during 60% of an orbit in 2007
September. We detect a simultaneous outburst at X-ray and VHE bands, with the
peak at phase 0.62 and a similar shape at both wavelengths. A linear fit to the
simultaneous X-ray/VHE pairs obtained during the outburst yields a correlation
coefficient of r=0.97, while a linear fit to all simultaneous pairs provides
r=0.81. Since a variable absorption of the VHE emission towards the observer is
not expected for the data reported here, the correlation found indicates a
simultaneity in the emission processes. Assuming that they are dominated by a
single particle population, either hadronic or leptonic, the X-ray/VHE flux
ratio favors leptonic models. This fact, together with the detected photon
indices, suggests that in LS I +61 303 the X-rays are the result of synchrotron
radiation of the same electrons that produce VHE emission as a result of
inverse Compton scattering of stellar photons.

a map on sutured Floer homology. This map is a common generalization of the hat

the contact gluing map defined by Honda, Kazez, and Mati\'c. We show that
sutured Floer homology, together with the above cobordism maps, forms a type of
TQFT in the sense of Atiyah. Applied to the sutured manifold cobordism
complementary to a decorated link cobordism, our theory gives rise to the
desired map on link Floer homology. Hence, link Floer homology is a
categorification of the multi-variable Alexander polynomial. We outline an
alternative definition of the contact gluing map using only the contact element

corrections to existing recombination codes can be achieved using simple
cosmology-independent `fudge functions'. Finally, we also investigated the
impact of some recent improvements in the treatment of hydrogen recombination
which are still not included in the current version of our training set for
Rico, by assuming that the cosmology dependence of those corrections can be
neglected. In summary, with our current understanding of the complete

inferred from Planck might be as large as -2.3, -1.7 and -1 sigmas for n_S,
Omega_b h2 and log(As) respectively, if all those corrections are not taken

performance with large, complete training sets is very similar, although the

increase, but they do so to a lesser extent and in a much smoother manner for
the case of GP regression. When training objects are removed at redshifts
1.3<z<1.7, to simulate the effects of the ""redshift desert"" of optical
spectroscopy, the GP regression is successful at interpolating across the
redshift gap, while the ANN suffers from strong bias for test objects in this
redshift range. Overall, GP regression has attractive properties for
photometric redshift estimation, particularly for deep, high-redshift surveys
where it is difficult to obtain a large, complete training set. At present,
unlike the ANN code, public GP regression codes do not take account of
inhomogeneous measurement errors on the photometric data, and thus cannot
estimate reliable uncertainties on the predicted redshifts. However, a better
treatment of errors is in principle possible, and the promising results in this

retain a nonzero eccentricity, possibly by dint of continuing interaction with
a third body. We calculate the amount of extra heating in the envelope that is
then required to fit the radius of each planet, and we explore how this
additional power depends on the planetary atmospheric opacity and on the mass
of a heavy-element central core. There is a degeneracy between the core mass
$M_{\rm core}$ and the heating $\dot{E}_{\rm heating}$. Therefore, in the case
of tidal heating, there is for each planet a range of the couple $\{M_{\rm
core},e^2/Q'_p\}$ that can lead to the same radius, where $Q'_p$ is the tidal
dissipation factor and $e$ is the eccentricity. With this in mind, we also
investigate the case of the non-inflated planet HAT-P-12b, which can admit
solutions combining a heavy-element core and tidal heating. A substantial
improvement of the measured eccentricities of such planetary systems could
simplify this degeneracy by linking the two unknown parameters $\{M_{\rm

correlated with times of periastron passage in the eccentric binary system.
After correcting for secular changes attributed to reduced extinction from the
thinning Homunculus Nebula, these peaks have IR spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) consistent with emission from hot dust at 1400-1700 K. The excess SEDs
are clearly inconsistent, however, with the excess being entirely due to
free-free wind or photospheric emission. One must conclude, therefore, that the
broad near-IR peaks associated with Eta Carinae's 5.5 yr variability are due to
thermal emission from hot dust. I propose that this transient hot dust results
from episodic formation of grains within compressed post-shock zones of the
colliding winds, analogous to the episodic dust formation in Wolf-Rayet binary
systems like WR140 or the post-shock dust formation seen in some supernovae
like SN2006jc. This dust formation in Eta Carinae seems to occur preferentially
near and after periastron passage; near-IR excess emission then fades as the
new dust disperses and cools. With the high grain temperatures and Eta Car's
C-poor abundances, the grains are probably composed of corundum or similar
species that condense at high temperatures, rather than silicates or graphite.
Episodic dust formation in Eta Car's colliding winds significantly impacts our
understanding of the system, and several observable consequences are discussed.

possible progenitors of supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei. Because of
their short nuclear burning timescales, such objects can be formed only when
matter is able to accumulate at a rate exceeding ~ 1 solar mass/yr. Here we
revisit the structure and evolution of rotationally-stabilized supermassive
stars, taking into account their continuous accumulation of mass and their
thermal relaxation. We show that the outer layers of supermassive stars are not
thermally relaxed during much of the star's main sequence lifetime. As a
result, they do not resemble n=3 polytropes, as assumed in previous literature,
but rather consist of convective (polytropic) cores surrounded by convectively
stable envelopes that contain most of the mass. We compute the structures of
these envelopes, in which the specific entropy is proportional to the enclosed
mass M(R) to the 2/3-power. By matching the envelope solutions to convective
cores, we calculate the core mass as a function of time. We estimate the
initial black hole masses formed as a result of core-collapse, and their
subsequent growth via accretion from the bloated envelopes (""quasistars"") that
result. The seed black holes formed in this way could have typical masses in
the range ~ 10^4-10^5 solar masses, considerably larger than the remnants
thought to be left by the demise of Population III stars. Supermassive black
holes therefore could have been seeded during an epoch of rapid infall
considerably later than the era of Pop III star formation.

giant stars have revealed the action of mixing mechanisms other than convection
in stellar interiors. Beryllium abundances in stars with lithium abundance
determinations can offer valuable complementary information on the nature of
these mechanisms. Our aim is to derive beryllium abundances along the whole
evolutionary sequence of an open cluster, IC 4651. These Be abundances are used
together with previously determined Li abundances, in the same sample stars, to
investigate the mixing mechanisms in a range of stellar masses and evolutionary
stages. New beryllium abundances are determined from high-resolution, high
signal-to-noise UVES spectra using spectrum synthesis and model atmospheres.
The careful synthetic modelling of the Be lines region is used to calculate
reliable abundances in rapidly rotating stars. The observed behavior of Be and
Li is compared to theoretical predictions from stellar models including
rotation-induced mixing, internal gravity waves, atomic diffusion, and
thermohaline mixing. Beryllium is detected in all the main sequence and
turn-off sample stars, both slow- and fast-rotating stars, including the Li-dip
stars, but was not detected in the red giants. Confirming previous results, we
find that the Li dip is also a Be dip, although the depletion of Be is more
modest than that of Li in the corresponding effective temperature range. For
post-main-sequence stars, the Be dilution starts earlier within the Hertzsprung
gap than expected from classical predictions as does the Li dilution. A clear
dispersion in the Be abundances is also observed. Theoretical stellar models
including the hydrodynamical transport processes mentioned above are able to
reproduce well all the observed features.

are Enforcer's wins, and our main interest lies in determining the largest

  Extremal graph theory offers a general upper bound for the number of
Avoider's moves. As it turns out, for all three games we manage to obtain a
lower bound that is just an additive constant away from that upper bound. In
particular, we exhibit a strategy for Avoider to keep his graph outerplanar for
at least $2n-8$ moves, being just 6 short of the maximum possible. A
diamond-free graph can have at most $d(n)=\lceil\frac{3n-5}{2}\rceil$ edges,

passbands across these wavelength and longitude ranges are derived by
calculating color excess ratios for G and K giant red clump stars in contiguous
midplane regions and deriving the wavelength dependence of extinction in each
one. Strong, monotonic variations in the extinction law shape are found as a
function of angle from the Galactic center, symmetric on either side of it.
These longitudinal variations persist even when dense interstellar regions,
known a priori to have a shallower extinction curve, are removed. The
increasingly steep extinction curves towards the outer Galaxy indicate a steady
decrease in the absolute-to-selective extinction ratio (R_V) and in the mean
dust grain size at greater Galactocentric angles. We note an increasing
strength of the 8 micron extinction inflection at high Galactocentric angles
and, using theoretical dust models, show that this behavior is consistent with
the trend in R_V. Along several lines of sight where the solution is most
feasible, A_lambda/A_Ks as a function of Galactic radius is estimated and shown
to have a Galactic radial dependence. Our analyses suggest that the observed
relationship between extinction curve shape and Galactic longitude is due to an
intrinsic dependence of the extinction law on Galactocentric radius.

emphasis on attempting to confirm or otherwise the spectral feature claimed in

is always flatter than the canonical value of 2.14 except for the Kp0 mask
which is steeper. Irrespective of this, we can not confirm the presence of any
feature in the free-free spectrum. We experiment with a more extensive approach
to the cleaning of the data, introduced in connection with the iterative
application of FASTICA. We confirm the presence of a residual foreground whose
spatial distribution is concentrated along the Galactic plane, with pronounced
emission near the Galactic center. This is consistent with the WMAP haze
detected in Finkbeiner 2004. Finally, we attempted to perform the same analysis
on full-sky maps. The code returns good results even for those regions where
the cross-talk among the components is high. However, slightly better results
in terms of the possibility of reconstructing a full-sky CMB map, are achieved
with a simultaneous analysis of both the five WMAP maps and foreground
templates. Nonetheless, some residuals are still present and detected in terms
of an excess in the CMB power spectrum, on small angular scales. Therefore, a
minimal mask for the brightest regions of the plane is necessary, and has been
defined.

WDW-equation and its solutions are ``ignorant'' of the coordinate patch one is
using, only by imposing coordinate conditions we can differentiate between
cosmological and black hole models. At that point, the foliation parameter $t$
or $r$ will appear in the solution of interest. In this work we supersymmetrize
this WDW-equation obtaining an extra term in the potential with two possible
signs. The WKB method is then applied, given rise to two classical equations.
It is shown that the event horizon can never be reached because, very near to
it the extra term in the potential, for each one of the equations, is more
relevant than the one that corresponds to Schwarzschild. One can then study the
asymptotic cases in which one of the two terms in the Hamiltonian dominates the
behavior. One of them corresponds to the usual Schwarzschild black hole. We
will study here the other two asymptotic regions; they provide three solutions.
All of them have a singularity in $r=0$ and depending on an integration
constant $C$ they can also present a singularity in $r=C^2$. Neither of these
solutions have a Newtonian limit. The black hole solution we study is analyzed
between the singularity $r=C^2$ and a maximum radius $r_m$. We find an
associated mass, considering the related cosmological solution inside $r=C^2$,

along the outflows, i.e. $\sim 10-10^{10} R_{\rm Sch}$ from the black hole, the
local conditions can lead to the generation of non-thermal populations of
particles via, e.g., magnetic reconnection, magneto-centrifugal mechanisms,
diffusive processes, or the so-called converter mechanism. These non-thermal
populations of particles, interacting with dense matter, magnetic, and
radiation fields, could yield radio-to-gamma-ray emission via synchrotron
process, inverse Compton scattering, relativistic Bremsstrahlung, proton-proton

processes, like pair creation or the development of electromagnetic cascades,
could be also relevant in black-hole jets and their surroundings. Black holes
of different masses, accretion rates and environments show different
phenomenologies, as can be observed in AGNs, GRBs or microquasars. Nonetheless,
these sources basically share the same fundamental physics: accretion,
black-hole rotation, plus an environment, but they are individualized due to
their own specific conditions. In this paper, we qualitatively review the main
characteristics of the non-thermal emission produced in jets from black holes,

$E_F$ of the Co layers. Here we report theoretical results that give a positive
tunneling spin polarization and tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) that is in
good agreement with experiments. From density functional theory (DFT)
calculations, an Al-rich interface MTJ with atomic-level disorder is shown to
have a positively polarized DOS near the interface. We also provide an atomic
model calculation which gives insights into the source of the positive
polarization. A layer and spin dependent effective mass model, using values
extracted from the DFT results, is then used to calculate the tunneling
current, which shows positive spin polarization. Finally, we calculate the TMR
from the tunneling spin polarization which shows good agreement with
experiments.

invariance of measure (UE) in a unified way, using a combination of Tracy-Widom
(TW) and Adler-Shiota-Van Moerbeke (ASvM) approaches to derivation of partial
differential equations (PDE) for spectral gap probabilities. First, general
3-term recurrence relations for UE restricted to subsets of real line, or, in
other words, for functions in the resolvent kernel, are obtained. Using them,
simple universal relations between all TW dependent variables and
one-dimensional Toda lattice $\tau$-functions are found. A universal system of
PDE for UE is derived from previous relations, which leads also to a {\it
single independent PDE} for spectral gap probability of various UE.
  Thus, orthogonal function bases and Toda lattice are seen at the core of
correspondence of different approaches. Moreover, Toda-AKNS system provides a
common structure of PDE for unitary ensembles. Interestingly, this structure
can be seen in two very different forms: one arises from orthogonal
functions-Toda lattice considerations, while the other comes from Schlesinger
equations for isomonodromic deformations and their relation with TW equations.
The simple example of Gaussian matrices most neatly exposes this structure.

leading possibilities are binarity and a nonradial mode of oscillation. Here,
large samples of red giants in the Large Magellanic Cloud both with and without
LSPs are examined for evidence of an 8 or 24 $\mu$m mid-IR excess caused by
circumstellar dust. It is found that stars with LSPs show a significant mid-IR
excess compared to stars without LSPs. Furthermore, the near-IR $J$-$K$ color
seems unaffected by the presence of the 24 $\mu$m excess. These findings
indicate that LSPs cause mass ejection from red giants and that the lost mass
and circumstellar dust is most likely in either a clumpy or a disk-like
configuration. The underlying cause of the LSP and the mass ejection remains
unknown.

we consider the application of the mixed fermion-boson model to ultracold
quantum gases and simulate the dynamics of dissociation of a Bose-Einstein
condensate of bosonic dimers into pairs of fermionic atoms. We quantify
deviations of atom-atom pair correlations from Wick's factorization scheme, and
show that atom-molecule and molecule-molecule correlations grow with time, in
clear departures from pairing mean-field theories. As a first-principles

with finite circumference. The model is the first member LM(1,2) of the
Yang-Baxter integrable series of logarithmic minimal models. The cylinder
topology allows for non-contractible loops with fugacity alpha that wind around
the cylinder or for an arbitrary number ell of defects that propagate along the
full length of the cylinder. Using an enlarged periodic Temperley-Lieb algebra,
we set up commuting transfer matrices acting on states whose links are
considered distinct with respect to connectivity around the front or back of
the cylinder. These transfer matrices satisfy a functional equation in the form
of an inversion identity. For even N, this involves a non-diagonalizable braid
operator J and an involution R=-(J^3-12J)/16=(-1)^{F} with eigenvalues
R=(-1)^{ell/2}. The number of defects ell separates the theory into sectors.
For the case of loop fugacity alpha=2, the inversion identity is solved exactly
for the eigenvalues in finite geometry. The eigenvalues are classified by the
physical combinatorics of the patterns of zeros in the complex
spectral-parameter plane yielding selection rules. The finite-size corrections
are obtained from Euler-Maclaurin formulas. In the scaling limit, we obtain the
conformal partition functions and confirm the central charge c=-2 and conformal
weights Delta_t=(t^2-1)/8. Here t=ell/2 and t=2r-s in the ell even sectors with
Kac labels r=1,2,3,...; s=1,2 while t is half-integer in the ell odd sectors.
Strikingly, the ell/2 odd sectors exhibit a W-extended symmetry but the ell/2
even sectors do not. Moreover, the naive trace summing over all ell even
sectors does not yield a modular invariant.

followed their evolution in time. To interpret the observations, we created a
geometrical model of a rising loop in 3D. The relevant parameters of the loop
were matched to the observations where possible. We then synthesized spectra
from the 3D model for a comparison to the observations. We found signatures of
magnetic flux emergence within a growing granule. In the early phases, a
horizontal magnetic field with a distinct linear polarization signal dominated
the emerging flux. Later on, two patches of opposite circular polarization
signal appeared symmetrically on either side of the linear polarization patch,
indicating a small loop-like structure. The mean magnetic flux density of this
loop was roughly 450 G, with a total magnetic flux of around 3x10^17 Mx. During
the ~12 min episode of loop occurrence, the spatial extent of the loop
increased from about 1 to 2 arcsec. The middle part of the appearing feature
was blueshifted during its occurrence, supporting the scenario of an emerging
loop. The temporal evolution of the observed spectra is reproduced to first

be explained as a case of flux emergence in the shape of a small-scale loop.

magnetic field of neutron stars. The fundamental line provides a measure of the
field strength, while the harmonic lines provide information about the
structure and configuration of the magnetic field. Until now only a handful of
sources are known to display more than one cyclotron line and only two of them
have shown a series of harmonics. The aim of this work is to see the first
harmonic cyclotron line, confirming the fundamental line at around 22 keV, thus
increasing the number of sources with detected harmonic cyclotron lines. To
investigate the presence of absorption or emission lines in the spectra, we
have combined RXTE and INTEGRAL spectra. We modeled the 3-100 keV continuum
emission with a power law with an exponential cut off and look for the second
absorption feature. We show evidence of an unknown cyclotron line at around 47
keV (the first harmonic) in the phase-averaged X-ray spectra of 4U 1538-52.
This line is detected by several telescopes at different epochs, even though
the signal-to-noise ratio of each individual spectrum is low. We conclude that
the line-like absorption is a real feature, and the most straightforward
interpretation is that it is the first harmonic, thus making 4U 1538-52 the
fifth X-ray pulsar with more than one cyclotron line.

intracellular environment. Main implicit assumptions behind such approaches are
that reactions occur in compartment volumes which are large enough so that
molecular discreteness can be ignored and that molecular transport occurs via
diffusion. Starting from a master equation description of enzyme reaction
kinetics and assuming metabolic steady-state conditions, we derive novel
mesoscopic rate equations which take into account (i) the intrinsic molecular
noise due to the low copy number of molecules in intracellular compartments
(ii) the physical nature of the substrate transport process, i.e. diffusion or
vesicle-mediated transport. These equations replace the conventional
macroscopic and deterministic equations in the context of intracellular
kinetics. The latter are recovered in the limit of infinite compartment
volumes. We find that deviations from the predictions of classical kinetics are
pronounced (hundreds of percent in the estimate for the reaction velocity) for
enzyme reactions occurring in compartments which are smaller than approximately
200nm, for the case of substrate transport to the compartment being mediated
principally by vesicle or granule transport and in the presence of competitive
enzyme inhibitors. This has implications for the common approach of modelling
large intracellular reaction networks using ordinary differential equations and
also for the calculation of the effective dosage of competitive inhibitor
drugs.

out an intrinsic variation of the X-ray source as the origin of the flux
changes, and points to a possible partial eclipse as the origin of the variable

number of emission features in the low flux state, which either disappear or
change into absorption features in the high flux state. A new XMM-Newton

the results show that nonlocal excitations cause sub-bands in the strong
Coulomb interaction regime due to strong antiferromagnetic correlations,
decrease the quasi-particle peak on the Fermi level with increasing Coulomb

spectroscopic binary stars HD78418, HD123999, HD160922, HD200077 and HD210027.
They were obtained based on the high resolution echelle spectra collected with
the Keck I/Hires, Shane/CAT/Hamspec and TNG/Sarge telescopes/spectrographs over
the years 2003-2008 as a part of TATOOINE search for circumbinary planets. The
RVs were computed using our novel iodine cell technique for double-line binary
stars. The precision of the RVs is of the order of 1-10 m/s. Our RVs combined
with the archival visibility measurements from the Palomar Testbed
Interferometer allow us to derive very precise spectroscopic/astrometric
orbital and physical parameters of the binaries. In particular, we derive the
masses, the absolute K and H band magnitudes and the parallaxes. The masses
together with the absolute magnitudes in the K and H bands enable us to
estimate the ages of the binaries.
  These RVs allow us to obtain some of the most accurate mass determinations of
binary stars. The fractional accuracy in m*sin(i) only and hence based on the
RVs alone ranges from 0.02% to 0.42%. When combined with the PTI astrometry,
the fractional accuracy in the masses ranges in the three best cases from 0.06%
to 0.5%. Among them, the masses of HD210027 components rival in precision the
mass determination of the components of the relativistic double pulsar system
PSRJ0737-3039. In the near future, for double-lined eclipsing binary stars we
expect to derive masses with a fractional accuracy of the order of up to
~0.001% with our technique. This level of precision is an order of magnitude
higher than of the most accurate mass determination for a body outside the
Solar System - the double neutron star system PSRB1913+16.

authors, using computational techniques well beyond the simple density
functional theory and the approximations GGA or LDA, claim that the band gap is
about 4.0 eV and that the conduction band is of Ni-3d nature. Thus they seem to
forget the results of electron energy-loss spectroscopy and inelastic x-ray
scattering, both able to determine electronic transitions of only about 1.0 eV
to an optically forbidden Ni-3d band. Further, a simple atomic calculation of
the Ni++ spin flip energy demonstrates that a Ni-3d band at 4.0 eV is
impossible. To set the issue straight, we calculated NiO with the very
successful technique of PRB 78, 125116 (2008). It turns out that a band at 4.0
eV is optically accessible and made of excited atomic states, not Ni-3d. Aside
from that, we also found a narrow Ni-3d band at about 1.0 eV. To confirm our
procedures once again, we also calculated MnO and obtained the standard results
of the good calculations as those cited above, and of experiment.

an unprecedented fidelity, in some cases achieving spatial resolutions of ~100
pc. With one exception our sources have diameters ranging from 1-7 kpc, star
formation rates of 2-40 Msun/yr (uncorrected for extinction) and dynamical
masses of 10^(9.7-10.3) Msun. With this exquisite resolution we find that four
of the six galaxies display coherent velocity fields consistent with a simple
rotating disk model, which can only be recovered with the considerably improved
spatial resolution and sampling from the combination of adaptive optics and
strong gravitational lensing. Our model fits imply ratios for the systemic to
random motion, V sin(i)/sigma, ranging from 0.5-1.3 and Toomre disk parameters
Q<1. The large fraction of well-ordered velocity fields in our sample is
consistent with data analyzed for larger, more luminous sources at this
redshift. Our high resolution data further reveal that all six galaxies contain
multiple giant star-forming HII regions whose resolved diameters are in the
range 300 pc - 1.0 kpc, consistent with the Jeans length expected in the case
of dispersion support. The density of star formation in these regions is ~100
times higher than observed in local spirals; such high values are only seen in
the most luminous local starbursts. The global dynamics and demographics of
star formation in these HII regions suggest that vigorous star formation is
primarily governed by gravitational instability in primitive rotating disks.

moderately low values of $P$. The structure of the magnetic field varies

charge transport properties, such as high temperature superconductivity
(cuprates) and colossal magnetoresistance (manganites). Astonishing, the mother
system of these compounds is a Mott insulator, whereas important role in the
establishment of the metallic or superconducting state is played by the way
that holes are self-organized with doping. Experiments have shown that by
adding holes the insulating phase breaks into antiferromagnetic (AFM) regions,
which are separated by hole rich clumps (stripes) with a rapid change of the
phase of the background spins and orbitals. However, recent experiments in
overdoped manganites of the La(1-x)Ca(x)MnO(3) (LCMO) family have shown that
instead of charge stripes, charge in these systems is organized in a uniform
charge density wave (CDW). Besides, recent theoretical works predicted that the
ground state is inhomogeneously modulated by orbital and charge solitons, i.e.
narrow regions carrying charge (+/-)e/2, where the orbital arrangement varies
very rapidly. So far, this has been only a theoretical prediction. Here, by
using 139La Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) we provide direct evidence that
the ground state of overdoped LCMO is indeed solitonic. By lowering temperature
the narrow NMR spectra observed in the AFM phase are shown to wipe out, while
for T<30K a very broad spectrum reappears, characteristic of an incommensurate
(IC) charge and spin modulation. Remarkably, by further decreasing temperature,
a relatively narrow feature emerges from the broad IC NMR signal, manifesting
the formation of a solitonic modulation as T->0.

Bremsstrahlung, synchrotron and inverse Comptonization of soft photons are
considered as possible cooling mechanisms, for sub-Eddington, Eddington and
super-Eddington mass accretion rates around Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes
with a Kerr parameter 0.998. It is found that the flow, during its infall from
the Keplerian to sub-Keplerian transition region to the black hole event
horizon, passes through various phases of advection -- general advective
paradigm to radiatively inefficient phase and vice versa. Hence the flow
governs much lower electron temperature ~10^8-10^{9.5} K, in the range of
accretion rate in Eddington units 0.01 <~ \mdot <~ 100, compared to the hot
protons of temperature ~ 10^{10.2} - 10^{11.8}K. Therefore, the solution may
potentially explain the hard X-rays and \gamma-rays emitted from AGNs and X-ray
binaries. We then show that a weakly viscous flow is expected to be cooling
dominated, particularly at the inner region of the disc, compared to its highly
viscous counterpart which is radiatively inefficient. With all the solutions in
hand, we finally reproduce the observed luminosities of the under-fed AGNs and
quasars (e.g. Sgr A^*) to ultra-luminous X-ray sources (e.g. SS433), at
different combinations of input parameters such as mass accretion rate, ratio
of specific heats. The set of solutions also predicts appropriately the
luminosity observed in the highly luminous AGNs and ultra-luminous quasars
(e.g. PKS 0743-67).

to detect neutrinos produced by the annihilation of weakly interacting massive
dark matter particles (WIMPs) in the Sun. We emphasize that the astrophysics of
the problem is understood; models can be observed or, alternatively, ruled out.
In searching for a WIMP with spin-independent interactions with ordinary
matter, IceCube is only competitive with direct detection experiments if the
WIMP mass is sufficiently large. For spin-dependent interactions IceCube
already has improved the best limits on spin-dependent WIMP cross sections by
two orders of magnitude. This is largely due to the fact that models with
significant spin-dependent couplings to protons are the least constrained and,
at the same time, the most promising because of the efficient capture of WIMPs
in the Sun. We identify models where dark matter particles are beyond the reach
of any planned direct detection experiments while being within reach of
neutrino telescopes. In summary, we find that, even when contemplating recent
direct detection results, neutrino telescopes have the opportunity to play an
important as well as complementary role in the search for particle dark matter.

which are common in biology and physics. Negative feedback loops tend to
promote oscillation around steady states, and their stability depends on the
particular shape of the delay distribution. Since in applications the mean
delay is often the only reliable information available about the distribution,
it is desirable to find conditions for stability that are independent from the

Therefore, distributed delays stabilize negative feedback loops.

(BCV) that are laminar helical vertical updrafts. These results point to the
discovery of a small parameter besides the Rossby number; this could relate the
problem of rotating helical turbulence to that of critical phenomena, through
renormalization group and weak turbulence theory. This parameter can be
associated with the adimensionalized ratio of the energy to helicity flux to
small scales, the three-dimensional energy cascade being weak and self-similar.

identify low mass and brown dwarf members of the old open cluster Praesepe (age
of 590[+150][-120]Myr and distance of 190[+6.0][-5.8]pc) and use this to infer
its mass function which we compare with that of other clusters. We have
performed an optical (Ic-band) and near-infrared (J and Ks-band) photometric
survey of Praesepe with a spatial coverage of 3.1deg^2. With 5sigma detection
limits of Ic=23.4 and J=20.0, our survey is sensitive to objects with masses
from about 0.6 to 0.05Msol. The mass function of Praesepe rises from 0.6Msol
down to 0.1Msol and then turns-over at ~0.1Msol. The rise observed is in
agreement with the mass function derived by previous studies, including a
survey based on proper motion and photometry. Comparing our mass function with
that for another open cluster with a similar age, the Hyades (age ~ 600Myr), we
see a significant difference. Possible reasons are that dynamical evaporation
has not influenced the Hyades and Praesepe in the same way, or that the
clusters did not have the same initial mass function, or that dynamical
interactions have modified the evolution of one or both clusters. Although a
difference in the binary fractions of the clusters could cause the observed
(i.e. system) mass functions to differ, measurements in the literature give no
evidence for a significant difference in the binary fractions of the two
clusters. Of our cluster candidates, six have masses predicted to be equal to
or below the stellar/substellar boundary at 0.072Msol.

use of S duality and then finally to its mirror dual Type IIA R-R sector, with
note of how this sector breaks S duality invariance in Type IIA. The nilpotency
and tadpole constraints associated with the fluxes induced by both dualities
are derived, explicitly demonstrated to be mirror invariant and classified in
terms of S duality multiplets. These results are then used to motivate the
postulation of an additional symmetry for internal spaces which are their own
mirror duals and an analysis is done of the resultant constraints for such a
construction.

BH evaporation, the absorption of radiation, collisions of two BHs to give a

Seyfert 1 galaxy PMN J0948+0022 (z=0.5846), we started a multiwavelength
campaign from radio to gamma rays, which was carried out between the end of
March and the beginning of July 2009. The source displayed activity at all the
observed wavelengths: a general decreasing trend from optical to gamma-ray
frequencies was followed by an increase of radio emission after less than two
months from the peak of the gamma-ray emission. The largest flux change, about
a factor of about 4, occurred in the X-ray band. The smallest was at
ultraviolet and near-infrared frequencies, where the rate of the detected
photons dropped by a factor 1.6-1.9. At optical wavelengths, where the sampling
rate was the highest, it was possible to observe day-scale variability, with
flux variations up to a factor of about 3. The behavior of PMN J0948+0022
observed in this campaign and the calculated power carried out by its jet in
the form of protons, electrons, radiation and magnetic field are quite similar
to that of blazars, specifically of flat-spectrum radio quasars. These results
confirm the idea that radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies host
relativistic jets with power similar to that of average blazars.
