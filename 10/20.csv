supernova remnants (SNRs). By measuring the morphology of the Chandra X-ray
line emission in seventeen Galactic and Large Magellanic Cloud SNRs with a
multipole expansion analysis (using power ratios), we find that the
core-collapse SNRs are statistically more asymmetric than the Type Ia SNRs. We
show that the two classes of supernovae can be separated naturally using this
technique because X-ray line morphologies reflect the distinct explosion
mechanisms and structure of the circumstellar material. These findings are
consistent with recent spectropolarimetry results showing that core-collapse
SNe are intrinsically more asymmetric.

observed multiple epochs of 11 actively accreting T Tauri stars in the nearby
Taurus-Auriga star forming region. In total, 88 low-resolution mid-infrared
spectra were collected over 1.5 years in Cycles 2 and 3. The results of this
multi-epoch survey show that the 10 um silicate complex in the spectra of two
sources - DG Tau and XZ Tau - undergoes significant variations with the
silicate feature growing both weaker and stronger over month- and year-long
timescales. Shorter timescale variations on day- to week-long timescales were
not detected within the measured flux errors. The time resolution coverage of
this data set is inadequate for determining if the variations are periodic.
Pure emission compositional models of the silicate complex in each epoch of the
DG Tau and XZ Tau spectra provide poor fits to the observed silicate features.
These results agree with those of previous groups that attempted to fit only
single-epoch observations of these sources. Simple two-temperature, two-slab
models with similar compositions successfully reproduce the observed variations
in the silicate features. These models hint at a self-absorption origin of the
diminution of the silicate complex instead of a compositional change in the
population of emitting dust grains. We discuss several scenarios for producing
such variability including disk shadowing, vertical mixing, variations in disk
heating, and disk wind events associated with accretion outbursts.

the attraction between the atoms we observe that the gas, instead of
contracting, anomalously expands. This expansion results from the combination
of two effects induced by pair formation in a lattice potential: the
suppression of quantum fluctuations as the attraction increases, which leads to
a dominant role of entropy, and the progressive loss of the spin degree of
freedom, which forces the gas to excite additional orbital degrees of freedom
and expand to outer regions of the trap in order to maintain the entropy. The
unexpected thermodynamics we observe reveal fundamentally distinctive features

an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero that come with an
effective multigrading of complexity one by means of generators and relations.
This enables us to construct systematically varieties with free divisor class
group and a complexity one torus action via their Cox rings. For the Fano
varieties of this type that have a free divisor class group of rank one, we
provide explicit bounds for the number of possible deformation types depending
on the dimension and the index of the Picard group in the divisor class group.
As a consequence, one can produce classification lists for fixed dimension and
Picard index. We carry this out expemplarily in the following cases. There are
15 non-toric surfaces with Picard index at most six. Moreover, there are 116
non-toric threefolds with Picard index at most two; nine of them are locally
factorial, i.e. of Picard index one, and among these one is smooth, six have
canonical singularities and two have non-canonical singularities. Finally,
there are 67 non-toric locally factorial fourfolds and two one-dimensional
families of non-toric locally factorial fourfolds. In all cases, we list the
Cox rings explicitly.

that the a thin ring plus a thin shell gives statistically the best description

inverse-Compton (IC) radiation. Interstellar-medium gas clouds engulfed by the
expanding lobes, and photoionized by the active nucleus, are responsible for
the radio spectral turnover through free-free absorption (FFA) of the
synchrotron photons. The model provides a description of the evolution of the
spectral energy distribution (SED) of GPS sources with their expansion,
predicting significant and complex high-energy emission, from the X-ray to the
gamma-ray frequency domain. Here, we test this model with the broad-band SEDs
of a sample of eleven X-ray emitting GPS galaxies with Compact-Symmetric-Object

frequencies lower than the spectral turnover is indeed well accounted for by
the FFA mechanism; (ii) the observed X-ray spectra can be interpreted as
non-thermal radiation produced via IC scattering of the local radiation fields
off the lobe particles, providing a viable alternative to the thermal,
accretion-disk dominated scenario. We also show that the relation between the
hydrogen column densities derived from the X-ray (N_H) and radio (N_HI) data of

future observations, would provide further support to our scenario of
high-energy emitting lobes.

broadband ultrashort phase-shaped pulses which are mixed in the nonlinear
medium with additional amplitude-shaped narrowband pulse. The spectrum of the
resulted four wave mixing signal is measured to provide the cross-correlation

hierarchy. Neutrinos from $^{18}$Ne and $^6$He with Lorentz boost $\gamma=350$
are detected in a 500 kton water \chr detector at a distance L=650 km from the

$\vartheta=34.5^\circ$ is required to send the beam to the magic baseline, the
far end of the ring has a maximum depth of $d=2132$ m. We alleviate this

the boost factor of the $^8$Li and $^8$B ions up to
$\gamma_{^8\mathrm{Li}}=390$ and $\gamma_{^8\mathrm{Li}}=650$, such that the

become anisotropic. We determine the general form of the complete set of
transport coefficients in the presence of a strong magnetic field. By using a
local linear response method, we calculate explicitly the bulk viscosities
$\zperp$ and $\zpara$ transverse and parallel to the $B$-field respectively,
which arise due to the non-leptonic weak processes $u+s\leftrightarrow u+d$. We
find that for magnetic fields $B<10^{17}$ G, the dependence of $\zperp$ and
$\zpara$ on the field is weak, and they can be approximated by the bulk
viscosity for zero magnetic field. For fields $B>10^{18}$ G, the dependence of
both $\zperp$ and $\zpara$ on the field is strong, and they exhibit de Haas-van
Alphen-type oscillations. With increasing magnetic field, the amplitude of
these oscillations increases, which eventually leads to negative $\zperp$ in
some regions of parameter space. We show that the change of sign of $\zperp$
signals a hydrodynamic instability. As an application, we discuss the effects
of the new bulk viscosities on the r-mode instability in rotating strange quark
stars. We find that the instability region in strange quark stars is affected
when the magnetic fields exceeds the value $B= 10^{17}$ G. For fields which are
larger by an order of magnitude, the instability region is significantly
enlarged, making magnetized strange stars more susceptible to $r$-mode
instability than their unmagnetized counterparts.

satisfying the appropriate Poisson equations have the property of ensuring that
a scalar potential can be constructed, in which both contributions, from
ordinary matter and $\Lambda > 0$, are attractive. In addition, there is a
novel tensor potential, induced by the pressure density, in which the effect of
the cosmological constant is repulsive. We also linearize the Schwarzschild-de
Sitter exact solution of Einstein's equations (due to a generalization of
Birkhoff's theorem) in the domain between the two horizons. We manage to
transform it first to a gauge in which the 3-space metric is conformally flat
and, then, make an additional coordinate transformation leading to the Lorentz
gauge conditions. We compare our non-spherically symmetric solution with the
linearized Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric, when the latter is transformed to

not acquire a proper Newtonian form in terms of the unique scalar potential

micro-Jy, we have identified radio counterparts for 17/20 of the 250-micron
sources. The resulting enhanced positional accuracy of ~1 arcsec has then
allowed us to exploit the deep multi-frequency imaging of GOODS-South to
establish secure galaxy counterparts for the 17 radio-identified sources, and
plausible galaxy candidates for the 3 radio-unidentified sources. Confusion is
a serious issue for this deep BLAST 250-micron survey, due to the large size of
the beam. Nevertheless, we argue that our chosen counterparts are significant,
and often dominant contributors to the measured BLAST flux densities. For all
of these 20 galaxies we have been able to determine spectroscopic (8) or
photometric (12) redshifts. The result is the first `complete' redshift
distribution for a deep 250-micron selected galaxy sample. This reveals that
250-micron surveys reaching detection limits of ~30 mJy contain not only
low-redshift spirals/LIRGs, but also the extreme z~2 dust-enshrouded starburst
galaxies previously discovered at sub-millimetre wavelengths. Based on their
IRAC colours, we find that virtually all of the BLAST galaxy identifications

through 20 lens galaxies. We determine the baseline for no microlensing
magnification between two images from the ratios of emission line fluxes.
Relative to this baseline, the ratio between the continua of the two images
gives the difference in microlensing magnification. The histogram of observed
microlensing events peaks close to no magnification and is concentrated below
0.6 magnitudes, although two events of high magnification, $\Delta m \sim 1.5$,
are also present. We study the likelihood of the microlensing measurements
using frequency distributions obtained from simulated microlensing
magnification maps for different values of the fraction of mass in compact
objects, $\alpha$. The concentration of microlensing measurements close to
$\Delta m \sim 0$ can be explained only by simulations corresponding to very
low values of $\alpha$ (10% or less). A maximum likelihood test yields
$\alpha=0.05_{-0.03}^{+0.09}$ (90% confidence interval) for a quasar continuum
source of intrinsic size $r_{s_0}\sim 2.6 \cdot 10^{15} \rm cm$. Regarding the

immersed curves in the homogeneous space of a Lie group $G$. The contact
geometry of curves in low dimensional equi-affine geometry is then made
explicit. This delivers the complete set of invariant data which solves the
$G$-equivalence problem via a straightforward procedure, and which is, in some
sense a supplement to the equivariant method of Fels and Olver. Next, the
contact geometry of curves in general Riemannian manifolds $(M,g)$ is
described. For the special case in which the isometries of $(M,g)$ act
transitively, it is shown that the contact geometry provides an explicit
algorithmic construction of the differential invariants for curves in $M$. The
inputs required for the construction consist only of the metric $g$ and a
parametrisation of structure group SO(n); the group action is not required and
no integration is involved. To illustrate the algorithm we explicitly construct
complete sets of differential invariants for curves in the Poincare half-space
$H^3$ and in a family of constant curvature 3-metrics. It is conjectured that
similar results are possible in other Cartan geometries.

the cusp anomalous dimension. The minimal solution to these equations was shown
to be a sum over color dipoles. Here we explore potential contributions to the
soft anomalous dimension that go beyond the sum-over-dipoles formula. Such
contributions are constrained by factorization and invariance under rescaling
of parton momenta to be functions of conformally invariant cross ratios.
Therefore, they must correlate the color and kinematic degrees of freedom of at
least four hard partons, corresponding to gluon webs that connect four eikonal
lines, which first appear at three loops. We analyze potential contributions,
combining all available constraints, including Bose symmetry, the expected
degree of transcendentality, and the singularity structure in the limit where
two hard partons become collinear. We find that if the kinematic dependence is
solely through products of logarithms of cross ratios, then at three loops
there is a unique function that is consistent with all available constraints.
If polylogarithms are allowed to appear as well, then at least two additional
structures are consistent with the available constraints.

mass-ejection properties associated with massive stars, covering from Type
II/Ib/Ic core-collapse supernovae (SNe) to giant eruptions of Luminous Blue
Variables (LBV) and optical transients. Here, we hypothesize that a fraction of
these phenomena may have an explosive origin, the distinguishing ingredient
being the ratio of the prompt energy release E_dep to the envelope binding
energy E_binding. Using one-dimensional one-group radiation hydrodynamics and a
set of 10-25Msun, massive-star models, we explore the dynamical response of a
stellar envelope subject to a strong, sudden, and deeply-rooted energy release.
Following energy deposition, a shock systematically forms, crosses the
progenitor envelope on a day timescale, and breaks-out with a signal of
hour-to-days duration and a 10^5-10^11 Lsun luminosity. For E_dep > E_binding,
full envelope ejection results with a SN-like bolometric luminosity and kinetic
energy, modulations being commensurate to the energy deposited and echoing the
diversity of Type II-Plateau SNe. For E_dep ~ E_binding, partial envelope
ejection results with a small expansion speed, and a more modest but year-long
luminosity plateau, reminiscent of LBV eruptions or so-called SN impostors. For
E_dep < E_binding, we obtain a ""puffed-up"" star, secularly relaxing back to
thermal equilibrium. In parallel with gravitational collapse and Type II SNe,
we argue that the thermonuclear combustion of merely a few 0.01Msun of C/O
could power a wide range of explosions/eruptions in loosely-bound massive
stars, as those in the 8-12Msun range, or in more massive ones owing to their
proximity to the Eddington limit and/or critical rotation.

two confidential messages to two receivers, while a wire-tapper also receives

where individual secure messages are broadcast over open media and can be
received by any illegitimate receiver. The secrecy level is measured by the
equivocation rate at the eavesdropper. We first study the general
(non-degraded) broadcast channel with an eavesdropper. We present an inner
bound on the secrecy capacity region for this model. This inner bound is based
on a combination of random binning, and the Gelfand-Pinsker binning. We further
study the situation in which the channels are degraded. For the degraded
broadcast channel with an eavesdropper, we present the secrecy capacity region.
Our achievable coding scheme is based on Covers superposition scheme and random
binning. We refer to this scheme as the Secret Superposition Scheme. Our
converse proof is based on a combination of the converse proof of the
conventional degraded broadcast channel and Csiszar Lemma. We then assume that
the channels are Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and show that the Secret
Superposition Scheme with Gaussian codebook is optimal. The converse proof is
based on Costas entropy power inequality. Finally, we use a broadcast strategy
for the slowly fading wire-tap channel when only the eavesdroppers channel is
fixed and known at the transmitter. We derive the optimum power allocation for
the coding layers, which maximizes the total average rate.

cosmological recombination spectrum. With this example we want to demonstrate
that the cosmological recombination spectrum in principle is sensitive to
details related to possible extra energy release during recombination. We
restrict ourselves to DM models which produce a negligible primordial
distortion of the CMB energy spectrum. However, since during the epoch of
cosmological recombination a large fraction of the deposited energy can
directly go into ionizations and excitations of neutral atoms, both the
cosmological recombination spectrum and ionization history can still be
affected significantly. We compute the modifications to the cosmological
recombination spectrum using our multi-level HI and HeI recombination code,
showing that additional photons are created due to uncompensated loops of
transitions which are induced by DM annihilations. As we illustrate here, the
results depend on the detailed branching of the deposited energy into heating,
ionizations and excitations. This dependence in principle should allow us to
shed light on the nature of the underlying annihilating DM model (or more
generally speaking, the mechanism leading to energy injection) when measuring
the cosmological recombination spectrum. However, for current upper limits on
the potential DM annihilation rate during recombination the cosmological
recombination spectrum is only affected at the level of a few percent.
Nevertheless, we argue here that the cosmological recombination spectrum would
provide another independent and very direct way of checking for the presence of
sources of extra ionizing or exciting photons at high redshifts. This would
open an new window to possible (non-standard) processes occurring (abridged)

dust-cooling and the CMB. In the absence of dust grains, at redshifts z < 10
moderate characteristic masses (of 10s of Msun) are formed when the metallicity

fragmentation and only very large masses (of ~ 100s of Msun) are formed. These
effects become even more dramatic at z > 10 and the fragmentation mass scales
are always > 100s of Msun, independent of the initial metallicity. When dust
grains are present, sub-solar mass fragments are formed at any redshift for
metallicities Z > 10^{-6} Zsun because dust-cooling remains relatively
insensitive to the presence of the CMB. When Z > 10^{-3} Zsun, heating of dust
grains by the CMB at z > 5 favors the formation of larger masses, which become
super-solar when Z > 10^{-2} Zsun and z > 10. Finally, we discuss the

strongly on all scales than control samples of radio-quiet galaxies with the

significantly with radio luminosity on scales less than 1 Mpc. This proves that
the gaseous environment of a galaxy on the scale of its dark matter halo, plays
a key role in determining not only the probability that a galaxy is radio-loud
AGN, but also the total luminosity of the radio jet. Next, we compare the
clustering of radio galaxies with that of radio-loud quasars in the same

cluster in the same way. Our data show that most RLAGN are clustered more

microlensing of stars. Near caustic crossings, for example, some parts of the
source star will be more highly magnified than other parts. The spectrum of the
star is then no longer the same as when it is unmagnified, and measurements of
the atmospheric parameters and abundances will be affected. The accuracy of
abundances measured from spectra taken during microlensing events has become
important recently because of the use of highly magnified dwarf stars to probe
abundance ratios and the abundance distribution in the Galactic bulge. In this
paper, we investigate the effect of finite source effects on spectra by using
magnification profiles motivated by two events to synthesize spectra for dwarfs
between 5000K to 6200K at solar metallicity. We adopt the usual techniques for
analyzing the microlensed dwarfs, namely, spectroscopic determination of
temperature, gravity, and microturbulent velocity, relying on equivalent
widths. We find that ignoring the finite source effects for the more extreme
case results in errors in Teff < 45K, in log g of <0.1 dex and in
microturbulent velocity of <0.1 km/s. In total, changes in equivalent widths
lead to small changes in atmospheric parameters and changes in abundances of
<0.06 dex, with changes in [FeI/H] of <0.03 dex. For the case with a larger
source-lens separation, the error in [FeI/H] is <0.01 dex. This latter case
represents the maximum effect seen in events whose lightcurves are consistent
with a point-source lens, which includes the majority of microlensed bulge

and cellular automata - we make this intuition precise by defining an index, a
quantity that measures the ""net flow of quantum information"" through the
system. The index supplies a complete characterization of two properties of the
discrete dynamics. First, two systems S_1, S_2 can be pieced together, in the
sense that there is a system S which locally acts like S_1 in one region and
like S_2 in some other region, if and only if S_1 and S_2 have the same index.
Second, the index labels connected components of such systems: equality of the
index is necessary and sufficient for the existence of a continuous deformation
of S_1 into S_2. In the case of quantum walks, the index is integer-valued,
whereas for cellular automata, it takes values in the group of positive
rationals. In both cases, the map S -> ind S is a group homomorphism if
composition of the discrete dynamics is taken as the group law of the quantum
systems. Systems with trivial index are precisely those which can be realized
by partitioned unitaries, and the prototypes of systems with non-trivial index

transients recently reported by Kida et al. are consistent with being
additional examples of the Bower et al. transients. We refer to these groups of
events as ""long-duration radio transients"". The main characteristics of this
population are: time scales longer than 30 minute but shorter than several
days; rate, ~10^3 deg^-2 yr^-1; progenitors sky surface density of >60 deg^-2
(95% C.L.) at Galactic latitude ~40 deg; 1.4-5 GHz spectral slopes, f_\nu ~
\nu^alpha, with alpha>0; and most notably the lack of any counterparts in
quiescence in any wavelength. We rule out an association with many types of
objects. Galactic brown-dwarfs or some sort of exotic explosions remain
plausible options. We argue that an attractive progenitor candidate for these
radio transients is the class of Galactic isolated old neutron stars (NS). We
confront this hypothesis with Monte-Carlo simulations of the space distribution
of old NSs, and find satisfactory agreement for the large areal density.
Furthermore, the lack of quiescent counterparts is explained quite naturally.
In this framework we find: the mean distance to events in the Bower et al.
sample is of order kpc; the typical distance to the Kida et al. transients are
constrained to be between 30 pc and 900 pc (95% C.L.); these events should
repeat with a time scale of order several months; and sub-mJy level bursts
should exhibit Galactic latitude dependence. We discuss possible mechanisms
giving rise to the observed radio emission.

Simulations of gas-rich young galaxies show formation of internal clumps by
gravitational instabilities, clump coalescence into a bulge, and disk
thickening by strong stellar scattering. The bulge and thick disks of modern
galaxies may form this way. Simulations of minor mergers make thick disks too,
but there is an important difference. Thick disks made by internal processes
have a constant scale height with galactocentric radius, but thick disks made
by mergers flare. The difference arises because in the first case,
perpendicular forcing and disk-gravity resistance are both proportional to the
disk column density, so the resulting scale height is independent of this
density. In the case of mergers, perpendicular forcing is independent of the
column density and the low density regions get thicker; the resulting flaring
is inconsistent with observations. Late-stage gas accretion and thin disk
growth are shown to preserve the constant scale heights of thick disks formed
by internal evolution. These results reinforce the idea that disk galaxies
accrete most of their mass smoothly and acquire their structure by internal
processes, in particular through turbulent and clumpy phases at high redshift.

jet that is prograde on Jupiter and Saturn and retrograde on Uranus and
Neptune. The jets are variously thought to be driven by differential radiative
heating of the upper atmosphere or by intrinsic heat fluxes emanating from the
deep interior. But existing models cannot account for the different flow
configurations on the giant planets in an energetically consistent manner. Here
a three-dimensional general circulation model is used to show that the
different flow configurations can be reproduced by mechanisms universal across
the giant planets if differences in their radiative heating and intrinsic heat
fluxes are taken into account. Whether the equatorial jet is prograde or
retrograde depends on whether the deep intrinsic heat fluxes are strong enough
that convection penetrates into the upper troposphere and generates strong
equatorial Rossby waves there. Prograde equatorial jets result if convective
Rossby wave generation is strong and low-latitude angular momentum flux
divergence owing to baroclinic eddies generated off the equator is sufficiently
weak (Jupiter and Saturn). Retrograde equatorial jets result if either
convective Rossby wave generation is weak or absent (Uranus) or low-latitude
angular momentum flux divergence owing to baroclinic eddies is sufficiently

expanding both redshift range and detection threshold from the current state of
the art. Obtaining spectra for a fair sub-sample of this new data could be
cumbersome and expensive. However, adequate calibration of the true redshift
distribution of galaxies is vital to tapping the potential of these surveys. We
examine a promising alternative to direct spectroscopic follow up: calibration
of the redshift distribution of photometric galaxies via cross-correlation with
an overlapping spectroscopic survey whose members trace the same density field.
We review the theory, develop a pipeline, apply it to mock data from N-body
simulations, and examine the properties of this redshift distribution
estimator. We demonstrate that the method is effective, but the estimator is
weakened by two factors. 1) The correlation function of the spectroscopic
sample must be measured in many bins along the line of sight, rendering it
noisy and interfering with high quality reconstruction of the photometric
redshift distribution. 2) The method is not able to disentangle the photometric
redshift distribution from evolution in the bias of the photometric sample. We
establish the impact of these factors using our mock catalogs. Although it may
still be necessary to spectroscopically follow up a fair subsample of the
photometric survey data, further refinement may appreciably decrease the number
of spectra that will be needed to calibrate future surveys.

the mass and energy outflow rates to be 4 to 5 orders of magnitude below those

thus possible that in most Seyferts the feedback is not sufficient and may not

multispectra can distinguish between early universe theories that predict
nearly identical power spectra. However, the recovery of higher-order
multispectra is difficult from realistic data due to their complex response to
inhomogeneous noise and partial sky coverage, which are often difficult to
model analytically. A traditional alternative is to use one-point cumulants of
various orders, which collapse the information present in a multispectrum to
one number. The disadvantage of such a radical compression of the data is a
loss of information as to the source of the statistical behaviour. A recent
study by Munshi & Heavens (2009) has shown how to define the skew spectrum (the
power spectra of a certain cubic field, related to the bispectrum) in an
optimal way and how to estimate it from realistic data. The skew spectrum
retains some of the information from the full configuration-dependence of the
bispectrum, and can contain all the information on non-Gaussianity. In the
present study, we extend the results of the skew spectrum to the case of two
degenerate power-spectra related to the trispectrum. We also explore the
relationship of these power-spectra and cumulant correlators previously used to
study non-Gaussianity in projected galaxy surveys or weak lensing surveys. We
construct nearly optimal estimators for quick tests and generalise them to
estimators which can handle realistic data with all their complexity in a
completely optimal manner. We show how these higher-order statistics and the
related power spectra are related to the Taylor expansion coefficients of the
potential in inflation models, and demonstrate how the trispectrum can
constrain both the quadratic and cubic terms.

evolutionary models, especially the intriguing system M33 X-7 which harbours
one of the most massive stellar-mass black holes (16 solar masses) orbiting a
70 solar mass O-star every 3.5 days. In standard binary evolution theory an
episode of mass transfer or common envelope is inevitable in a binary with such
a small orbital period, which complicates the formation of a black hole with
such a high mass.
  To explain this system, we discuss a new binary evolution channel (De Mink et
al. 2009), in which rotational mixing plays an important role. In very massive
close binaries, tides force the rotation rate of the stars to be so high that
rotationally induced mixing becomes very efficient. Helium produced in the
center is mixed throughout the envelope. Instead of expanding during their
mainsequence evolution (with the inevitable consequence of mass transfer),
these stars stay compact, and avoid filling their Roche lobe. They gradually
evolve into massive helium stars. This scenario naturally leads to the
formation of very massive black holes in a very close orbit with a less evolved
massive companion such as M33 X-7.

condensation (BEC) crossover theories above the transition temperature:
Nozieres Schmitt-Rink (NSR) theory and finite $T$-extended BCS-Leggett theory.
The comparison is cast in the form of numerical studies of the behavior of the
fermionic spectral function both theoretically and as constrained by
(primarily) radio frequency (RF) experiments. Both theories include pair
fluctuations and exhibit pseudogap effects, although the nature of this
pseudogap is very different. The pseudogap in finite $T$-extended BCS-Leggett
theory is found to follow a BCS-like dispersion which, in turn, is associated
with a broadened BCS-like self energy, rather more similar to what is observed
in high temperature superconductors (albeit, for a d-wave case). The fermionic
quasi-particle dispersion is different in NSR theory and the damping is
considerably larger. We argue that the two theories are appropriate in
different temperature regimes with the BCS-Leggett approach more suitable
nearer to condensation. There should, in effect, be little difference at higher
$T$ as the pseudogap becomes weaker and where the simplifying approximations
used in the BCS-Leggett approach break down. On the basis of
momentum-integrated radio frequency studies of unpolarized gases, it would be
difficult to distinguish which theory is the better. A full comparison for
polarized gases is not possible since there is claimed to be inconsistencies in
the NSR approach (not found in the BCS-Leggett scheme). Future experiments
along the lines of momentum resolved experiments look to be very promising in
distinguishing the two theories.

first case we present an updated version of the Bayesian Adaptive Template
Matching program (BATM). To address some shortcomings of that strictly Bayesian
approach, we introduce a method for Supernova Ontology with Fuzzy Templates
(SOFT), which utilizes Fuzzy Set Theory for the definition and combination of
SN light curve models. For well-sampled light curves with a modest signal to
noise ratio (S/N>10), the SOFT method can correctly separate thermonuclear
(Type Ia) SNe from core collapse SNe with 98% accuracy. In addition, the SOFT
method has the potential to classify supernovae into sub-types, providing
photometric identification of very rare or peculiar explosions. The accuracy
and precision of the SOFT method is verified using Monte Carlo simulations as
well as real SN light curves from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the
SuperNova Legacy Survey. In a subsequent paper the SOFT method is extended to
address the problem of parameter estimation, providing estimates of redshift,

\sign(w\cdot x - \theta)$ over the $n$-dimensional Boolean hypercube can be
approximated by simple threshold functions.
  Our first result shows that every $n$-variable threshold function $f$ is
$\eps$-close to a threshold function depending only on $\Inf(f)^2 \cdot
\poly(1/\eps)$ many variables, where $\Inf(f)$ denotes the total influence or
average sensitivity of $f.$ This is an exponential sharpening of Friedgut's
well-known theorem \cite{Friedgut:98}, which states that every Boolean function
$f$ is $\eps$-close to a function depending only on $2^{O(\Inf(f)/\eps)}$ many
variables, for the case of threshold functions. We complement this upper bound
by showing that $\Omega(\Inf(f)^2 + 1/\epsilon^2)$ many variables are required
for $\epsilon$-approximating threshold functions.
  Our second result is a proof that every $n$-variable threshold function is
$\eps$-close to a threshold function with integer weights at most $\poly(n)
\cdot 2^{\tilde{O}(1/\eps^{2/3})}.$ This is a significant improvement, in the
dependence on the error parameter $\eps$, on an earlier result of
\cite{Servedio:07cc} which gave a $\poly(n) \cdot 2^{\tilde{O}(1/\eps^{2})}$
bound. Our improvement is obtained via a new proof technique that uses strong
anti-concentration bounds from probability theory. The new technique also gives
a simple and modular proof of the original \cite{Servedio:07cc} result, and
extends to give low-weight approximators for threshold functions under a range
of probability distributions beyond just the uniform distribution.

interpretation of observational features of black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs)
is applied to AGNs. Since the evaporation of gas in the disk can lead to its
truncation for accretion rates less than a maximal evaporation rate, the model
can naturally account for the soft spectrum in high luminosity AGNs and the
hard spectrum in low luminosity AGNs. The existence of two different luminosity
levels describing transitions from the soft to hard state and from the hard to
soft state in BHXRBs, when applied to AGNs, suggests that AGNs can be in either
spectral state within a range of luminosities. For example, at a viscosity
parameter, \alpha, equal to 0.3, the Eddington ratio from the hard to soft
transition and from the soft to hard transition occurs at 0.027 and 0.005
respectively. When the Eddington ratio of the AGN lies below the critical value
corresponding to its evolutionary state, the disk is truncated. With decreasing
Eddington ratios, the inner edge of the disk increases to greater distances
from the black hole with a concomitant increase in the inner radius of the
broad line region, $R_{BLR}$. The absence of an optically thick inner disk at
low luminosities gives rise to region in the size of borad line-luminosity
plane for which the relation $R_{BLR} \propto L^{1/2}$ inferred at high
luminosities is excluded. As a result, a lower limit to the accretion rate is
predicted for the observability of broad emission lines, if the broad line
region is associated with an optically thick accretion disk. Thus, true Seyfert
2 galaxies may exist at very low accretion rates/luminosities. The differences
between BHXRBs and AGNs in the framework of the disk corona model are discussed
and possible modifications to the model are briefly suggested.

phase sensitivities close to the Heisenberg limit when the average photon
number of the squeezed vacuum is close to the average photon number of the

the presence of photon losses. It is shown that the Cramer-Rao bound of phase
sensitivity can be achieved experimentally by using a weak local oscillator and
photon counting in the output. The phase sensitivity is then given by the
Fisher information F of the state. In the limit of high squeezing, the ratio
(F-N)/N^2 of Fisher information above shot noise to the square of the average
photon number N depends only on the average number of photons lost, n_loss, and
the fraction of squeezed vacuum photons mu. For mu=1/2, the effect of losses is
given by (F-N)/N^2=1/(1+2 n_loss). The possibility of increasing the robustness
against losses by lowering the squeezing fraction mu is considered and an
optimized result is derived. However, the improvements are rather small, with a
maximal improvement by a factor of two at high losses.

components originated from the surrounding interstellar matter (ISM) and the
ejecta of the Loop, respectively.
  From the best-fit results, we showed a flux distribution of the ISM
component. The distribution clearly shows the limb-brightening structure, and
we found out some low-flux regions. Among them, the south blowout region has
the lowest flux. We also found other large low-flux regions at slightly west
and the northeast from the center. We estimated the former thin shell region to
be 1.3 degrees in diameter and concluded that there exists a blowout along the
line of sight in addition to the south blowout. We also calculated the emission
measure distribution of the ISM component and showed that the Cygnus Loop is
far from the result obtained by a simple Sedov evolution model. From the
results, we support that the Cygnus Loop originated from a cavity explosion.
The emission measure distribution also suggests that the cavity-wall density is
higher in the northeast than that in the southwest. These results suggest that
the thickness of the cavity wall surrounding the Cygnus Loop is not uniform.

Compression is often viewed as just a technique to fit more data into a smaller
space. Rather, the packing of data - its ""density"" - affects every facet of
local data handling, long distance data transport, and the end-to-end
throughput of workflows. In short, compression is one aspect of proper data
structuring. For example, with FITS tile compression the efficient
representation of data is combined with an expressive logistical paradigm for
its manipulation.
  A deeper question remains. Not just how best to represent the data, but which
data to represent. CCDs are linear devices. What does this mean? One thing it
does not mean is that the analog-to-digital conversion of pixels must be stored
using linear data numbers (DN). An alternative strategy of using non- linear
representations is presented, with one motivation being to magnify the
efficiency of numerical compression algorithms such as Rice.

extradimensional theories, independently of the background metric, the lightest
component in the anti-periodic field becomes stable and hence a good candidate
for the dark matter in the effective 4D theory due to the remaining accidental
discrete symmetry. Noting that in the gauge-Higgs unification scenario,
introduction of anti-periodic fermions is well-motivated by a phenomenological
reason, we investigate dark matter physics in the scenario. As an example, we
consider a five-dimensional SO(5)$\timesU(1)_X$ gauge-Higgs unification model
compactified on the $S^1/Z_2$ with the warped metric. Due to the structure of
the gauge-Higgs unification, interactions between the dark matter particle and
the Standard Model particles are largely controlled by the gauge symmetry, and
hence the model has a strong predictive power for the dark matter physics.
Evaluating the dark matter relic abundance, we identify a parameter region
consistent with the current observations. Furthermore, we calculate the elastic
scattering cross section between the dark matter particle and nucleon and find
that a part of the parameter region is already excluded by the current
experimental results for the direct dark matter search and most of the region
will be explored in future experiments.

considering the geometry of a flat expanding Universe together with the
projected sizes of the background radio emission regions, we find, for the
detections, that the 21-cm line strength is correlated with the size of the
absorber. For the non-detections it is apparent that larger absorbers (covering
factors) are required in order to exhibit 21-cm absorption, particularly if
these DLAs do not arise in spiral galaxies. We also suggest that the recent z =

conclusions. We have analyzed 12 sunspots observed from Hinode (SOT/SP) to
clarify the issue. The azimuthal and radial components of magnetic fields and
currents have been derived. The azimuthal component of the magnetic field of
sunspots is found to vary in sign with azimuth. The radial component of the
field also varies in magnitude with azimuth. While the latter pattern is a
confirmation of the interlocking combed structure of penumbral filaments, the
former pattern shows that the penumbra is made up of a ""curly interlocking
combed"" magnetic field. The azimuthally averaged azimuthal component is seen to
decline much faster than 1/$\varpi$ in the penumbra, after an initial increase
in the umbra, for all the spots studied. This confirms the confinement of
magnetic fields and absence of a net current for sunspots as postulated by
\cite{parker96}. The existence of a global twist for a sunspot even in the
absence of a net current is consistent with a fibril-bundle structure of the
sunspot magnetic fields.

to randomize clusters of individuals--such as households, communities, firms,
medical practices, schools or classrooms--even when the individual is the unit
of interest. To recoup the resulting efficiency loss, some studies pair similar
clusters and randomize treatment within pairs. However, many other studies
avoid pairing, in part because of claims in the literature, echoed by clinical
trials standards organizations, that this matched-pair, cluster-randomization
design has serious problems. We argue that all such claims are unfounded. We
also prove that the estimator recommended for this design in the literature is
unbiased only in situations when matching is unnecessary; its standard error is
also invalid. To overcome this problem without modeling assumptions, we develop
a simple design-based estimator with much improved statistical properties. We
also propose a model-based approach that includes some of the benefits of our
design-based estimator as well as the estimator in the literature. Our methods
also address individual-level noncompliance, which is common in applications
but not allowed for in most existing methods. We show that from the perspective
of bias, efficiency, power, robustness or research costs, and in large or small
samples, pairing should be used in cluster-randomized experiments whenever
feasible; failing to do so is equivalent to discarding a considerable fraction

sufficiently accurate to provide useful cosmological constraints requires the
observation of ~100000 quasars in the redshift range 2.2<z<3.5 over ~8000 deg2.
Such a survey is planned by the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS)
project of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III).In practice, one needs a
stellar rejection of more than two orders of magnitude with a selection
efficiency for quasars better than 50% up to magnitudes as large as g ~ 22. To
obtain an appropriate target list and estimate quasar redshifts, we have
developed an Artificial Neural Networks (NN) with a multilayer perceptron
architecture. The input variables are photometric measurements, i.e. the object
magnitudes and their errors in the five bands (ugriz) of the SDSS photometry.
For target selection, we achieve a non-quasar point-like object rejection of
99.6% and 98.5% for a quasar efficiency of, respectively, 50% and 85%. The
photometric redshift precision is of the order of 0.1 over the region relevant

of some of the nearest, most well studied, active galactic nuclei (AGN) are
presented. These genuine AGN-core SEDs, mostly from Seyfert galaxies, are
characterised by two main features: an IR bump with the maximum in the 2-10
micron range, and an increasing X-ray spectrum in the 1 to ~200 keV region.
These dominant features are common to Seyfert type 1 and 2 objects alike. Type
2 AGN exhibit a sharp drop shortward of 2 micron, with the optical to UV region
being fully absorbed, while type 1s show instead a gentle 2 micron drop ensued
by a secondary, partially-absorbed optical to UV emission bump. Assuming the
bulk of optical to UV photons generated in these AGN are reprocessed by dust
and re-emitted in the IR in an isotropic manner, the IR bump luminosity
represents >70% of the total energy output in these objects while the high
energies above 20 keV are the second energetically important contribution.
  Galaxies selected by their warm IR colours, i.e. presenting a relatively-flat
flux distribution in the 12 to 60 micron range have often being classified as
AGN. The results from these high spatial resolution SEDs question this
criterion as a general rule. It is found that the intrinsic shape of the IR SED
of an AGN and inferred bolometric luminosity largely depart from those derived
from large aperture data. AGN luminosities can be overestimated by up to two
orders of magnitude if relying on IR satellite data. We find these differences
to be critical for AGN luminosities below or about 10^{44} erg/s. Above this
limit, AGNs tend to dominate the light of their host galaxy regardless of the
aperture size used. We tentatively mark this luminosity as a threshold to
identify galaxy-light- vs AGN- dominated objects.

in a homogeneous nanoscale-ferromagnetic thin film of the type used in

Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation. The LLG equation has an especially
appealing form under a complex stereographic projection, wherein the
qualitative equivalence of an applied field and a spin-current induced torque
is transparent. Recently chaotic behavior of such a spin vector has been
identified by Zhang and Li using a spin polarized current passing through the
pillar of constant polarization direction and periodically varying magnitude,
owing to the spin-transfer torque effect. In this paper we show that the same
dynamical behavior can be achieved using a periodically varying applied
magnetic field, in the presence of a constant DC magnetic field and constant
spin current, which is technically much more feasible, and demonstrate
numerically the chaotic dynamics in the system for an infinitely thin film.
Further, it is noted that in the presence of a nonzero crystal anisotropy field
chaotic dynamics occurs at much lower magnitudes of the spin-current and DC
applied field.

the two-photon absorption is coherently induced by the weak-field nonresonant
two-photon transitions as well as by additional resonance-mediated four-photon
transitions. It is a regime of significant excitation yields, exceeding the
weak-field yields by two orders of magnitudes, reaching about 10-20% population
transfer. The considered antisymmetric nature is with respect to one-half of
the (initial-to-final) two-photon transition frequency. The corresponding pulse
spectrum is detuned from this frequency (the detuning direction is according to
the system). We study in detail the coherent interference mechanism leading to
the observed enhancement using forth-order frequency-domain perturbative
analysis. We also show that, even though the maximal enhancement is achieved
with phase patterns of perfect antisymmetry, at high enough intermediate-field
intensities absorption enhancement beyond the transform-limited level is still
achievable even with patterns having some degree of deviation from perfect
antisymmetry. The degree of tolerance to deviations from perfect antisymmetry
increases as the pulse intensity increases. The theoretical and experimental
model system of the study is atomic sodium. These findings are of particular
importance for coherent control scenarios that simultaneously involve multiple
excitation channels.

knots. The active nucleus is embedded in the southernmost VLBI component A,
which is further resolved into two sub-components A1 and A2 at 4.8 and 8.3 GHz.
A1 shows a flat spectrum and A2 shows a steep spectrum. The most strongly
polarized VLBI components are located at component C $\sim$0.25 arcsec north of
the core. The polarization angles at C show gradual changes across the jet
width at all observed frequencies, indicative of a gradient in the
emission-weighted intrinsic polarization angle across the jet and possibly a
systematic gradient in the rotation measure; moreover, the percentage of
polarization increases near the curvature at C, likely consistent with the
presence of a local jet-ISM interaction and/or changing magnetic-field
directions. The hot spot B shows a higher rotation measure, and has no detected
proper motion. These facts provide some evidence for a stationary shock in the
vicinity of B. Comparison of the present VLBI observations with those made 8.43
years ago suggests a proper motion of $\beta_{app}=3.7\pm0.4 c$ for A2 to the
north. The apparent superluminal motion suggests that the relativistic jet
plasma moves at a velocity of $\gtrsim0.96 c$ if the jet is viewed at an
inclination angle less than $20\degr$. A simple precessing jet model and a
hydrodynamical isothermal jet model with helical-mode Kelvin-Helmholtz

for the description of the properties of the universe on extremely small
spacetime scales. Quantum theory for a homogeneous, isotropic and closed
universe is constructed on the basis of a Hamiltonian formalism with the use of
material reference system as a dynamical system defined by macroscopic
relativistic matter. The equations of the model are reduced to the form of the
Einstein-type equations in which the matter energy density has two components
of quantum nature, which behave as antigravitating fluids. The first component
does not vanish in the limit h -> 0 and can be associated with dark energy. The
second component is described by extremely rigid equation of state and goes to
zero after the transition to large spacetime scales. On small spacetime scales
this quantum correction determines the geometry of the universe. This geometry
is conformal to a unit four-sphere embedded in a five-dimensional Euclidean
flat space. When reaching the post-Planck era, the geometry of the universe
changes into the geometry conformal to a unit four-hyperboloid in a
five-dimensional Lorentz-signatured flat space. Near the boundary between two
regions the universe undergoes almost an exponential expansion which passes
smoothly into the expansion under the action of radiation dominating over
matter which is described by the standard cosmological model.

which would imply gas at still cooler temperatures. The range in detected gas
temperature in these objects is a factor of 3.7, 5.6 and 2 for Abell 262, Abell

filling fraction of 6 and 3 per cent for Abell 262 and Abell 3581, but is
likely to be volume filling in HCG 62. Chandra spatially resolved spectroscopy
confirms the low volume filling fractions of the cool gas in Abell 262 and
Abell 3581, indicating this cool gas exists as cold blobs. Any volume heating
mechanism aiming to prevent cooling would overheat the surroundings of the cool
gas by a factor of 4. If the gas is radiatively cooling below 0.5 keV, it is
cooling at a rate at least an order of magnitude below that at higher
temperatures in Abell 262 and Abell 3581 and two-orders of magnitude lower in
HCG 62. The gas may be cooling non-radiatively through mixing in these cool
blobs, where the energy released by cooling is emitted in the infrared. We find
very good agreement between smooth particle inference modelling of the cluster
and conventional spectral fitting. Comparing the temperature distribution from
this analysis with that expected in a cooling flow, there appears to be a even
larger break below 0.5 keV as compared with previous empirical descriptions of
the deviations of cooling flow models.

cross-identify two AGN catalogues with the 2MASS Point Source Catalogue, and
confirm both the loci of quasars/AGNs in the near-infrared CCD and
redshift-colour relations. In the CCD, the loci of over 70 - 80% of AGNs can be
distinguished from the stellar locus. To examine the colours of quasars, we
simulate near-infrared colours using Hyperz code. Assuming a realistic quasar
SED, we derive simulated near-infrared colours of quasars with redshift (up to
z ~ 11). The simulated colours can reproduce not only the redshift-colour
relations but also the loci of quasars/AGNs in the near-infrared CCD. We
finally discuss the possibility of contamination by other types of objects. We
compare the locus of AGNs with the other four types of objects (namely,
microquasars, CVs, LMXBs, and MYSOs) which have a radiation mechanism similar
to that of AGNs. In the near-infrared CCD, each type of object is located at a
position similar to the stellar locus. Accordingly, it is highly probable that
the four types of objects can be distinguished on the basis of the locus in a
near-infrared CCD. We additionally consider contamination by distant normal
galaxies. The near-infrared colours of several types of galaxies are also
simulated using the Hyperz code. Although galaxies with z ~ 1 have
near-infrared colours similar to those of AGNs, these galaxies are unlikely to
be detected because they are very faint. In other words, few galaxies should
contaminate the locus of AGNs in the near-infrared CCD. Consequently, we can
extract reliable AGN candidates on the basis of the near-infrared CCD.

Photo-excitation, which re-distributes charge between sites, can control this

have been performed in solids in which other degrees of freedom, such as
lattice, spin, or orbital excitations come into play. However, the underlying
quantum dynamics of bare electronic excitations has remained out of reach.
Quantum many-body dynamics have only been detected in the controlled
environment of optical lattices where the dynamics are slower and lattice
excitations are absent. By using nearly-single-cycle near-IR pulses, we have
measured coherent electronic excitations in the organic salt ET-F2TCNQ, a
prototypical one-dimensional Mott Insulator. After photo-excitation, a new
resonance appears on the low-energy side of the Mott gap, which oscillates at
25 THz. Time-dependent simulations of the Mott-Hubbard Hamiltonian reproduce
the oscillations, showing that electronic delocalization occurs through quantum
interference between bound and ionized holon-doublon pairs.

These information-theoretic measures of the associated Rakhmanov probability
density, which are direct measures of the polynomial spreading in the sense of
having the same units as the variable, share interesting properties: invariance
under translations and reflections, linear scaling and vanishing in the limit
that the variable tends towards a given definite value. The expressions of the
Renyi and Fisher lengths for the Hermite polynomials are computed in terms of
the polynomial degree. The combinatorial multivariable Bell polynomials, which
are shown to characterize the finite power of an arbitrary polynomial, play a
relevant role for the computation of these information-theoretic lengths.
Indeed these polynomials allow us to design an error-free computing approach
for the entropic moments (weighted L^q-norms) of Hermite polynomials and
subsequently for the Renyi and Tsallis entropies, as well as for the Renyi
spreading lengths. Sharp bounds for the Shannon length of these polynomials are
also given by means of an information-theoretic-based optimization procedure.
Moreover, it is computationally proved the existence of a linear correlation
between the Shannon length (as well as the second-order Renyi length) and the
standard deviation. Finally, the application to the most popular

some relevant asymptotical open issues related to the entropic moments

are shown to be organised in connected domains with fractal boundaries. They
correspond to trajectories first falling towards the bottom of the potential,
then climbing and slow-rolling back along the inflationary valley. The full

indicate that successful initial conditions (IC) outside the valley are not

analyzed large scale properties and substructures by applying a minimal

Namely, we test whether, on large enough scales (i.e., r>10 Mpc/h), this is
self-averaging, uniform and characterized by a Gaussian probability density
function of fluctuations. These are three different and clear predictions of
the LCDM cosmology which are fulfilled in mock galaxy catalogs generated from
cosmological N-body simulations representing this model. We consider some
simple statistical measurements able to tests these properties in a finite
sample. We discuss that the analysis of several samples of the Two Degree Field
Galaxy Redshift Survey and of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey show that galaxy
structures are non self-averaging and inhomogeneous on scales of ~100 Mpc/h,
and are thus intrinsically different from LCDM model predictions.
Correspondingly the probability density function of fluctuations shows a ""fat
tail"" and it is thus different from the Gaussian prediction. Finally we discuss
other recent observations which are odds with LCDM predictions and which are,
at least theoretically, compatible with the highly inhomogeneous nature of
galaxy distribution. We point out that inhomogeneous structures can be fully
compatible with statistical isotropy and homogeneity, and thus with a relaxed
version of the Cosmological Principle.

Evolution of the transverse momentum density fluctuation that gives rise to

system indicate that they may have passed through similar histories during
their formation stage. In this paper we investigate the dynamics and formation
of the orbital architecture in the OGLE-06-109L system. For the present two
planets with their nominal locations, the secular motions are stable as long as
their eccentricities (eb; ec) fulfill eb^2 + ec^2 < = 0.3^2. Earth-size bodies
might be formed and are stable in the habitable zone (0.25AU-0.36AU) of the

(i) convergent migration of two planets and the 3:1 MMR trapping; (ii)
planetary scattering; (iii) divergent migration and the 3:1 MMR crossing. As we
showed that the probability for the two giant planets in 3:1 MMR is low (~3%),
scenario (i) is less likely. According to models (ii) and (iii), the final
eccentricity of inner planet (eb) may oscillate between [0-0.06], comparable to
that of Jupiter (0.03-0.06). An inspection of eb, ec secular motion may be
helpful to understand which model is really responsible for the eccentricity
formation.

transistor and quantum spin Hall effects. The current-voltage characteristics
of the ultra-shallow p+-n junctions verify the CdF2 gap, 7.8 eV, and the
quantum subbands of the 2D holes in the p-type CdF2 quantum well confined by
the CdBxF2-x delta-barriers. The temperature and magnetic field dependencies of
the resistance, specific heat and magnetic susceptibility demonstrate the high
temperature superconductor properties for the CdBxF2-x delta-barriers. The
value of the superconductor energy gap, 102.06 meV, determined by the tunneling
spectroscopy method appears to be in a good agreement with the relationship
between the zero-resistance supercurrent in superconductor state and the
conductance in normal state at the energies of the 2D hole subbands. The
results obtained are evidence of the important role of the multiple Andreev
reflections in the creation of the high spin polarization of the 2D holes in
the edged channels of the sandwich device. The high spin hole polarization in
the edged channels is shown to identify the mechanism of the spin transistor
and quantum spin Hall effects induced by varying the top gate voltage, which is
revealed by the first observation of the Hall quantum conductance staircase.

interpretation are: (T1), linearity; (T2), invariance under certain groups; and
(T3) the orthogonality and isolation of the different branches of the state
vector. These three imply the particle-like properties of mass, energy,
momentum, spin, charge, and locality are actually properties of the state
vector; and this in turn implies there is no evidence for the existence of
particles. Experimentally there is no evidence for collapse (E1) and
theoretically linearity prohibits collapse. One also has the experimentally
verified probability law (E2), which is found to rule out the many-worlds
interpretation. The failure of these three major interpretation, particles,
collapse, and many-worlds, apparently implies an acceptable interpretation must
be based on perception. Rather than being a separate principle, probability
follows in this interpretation from a weak assumption on perception plus the
combinatorics when an experiment is run many times. This suggests a relatively
simple experimental test of the perception interpretation.

nucleosynthesis of the {\it s}-process elements. The second effect is a
consequence of the first. Strong mixing makes possible the apparition at the
surface of important quantities of CNO elements. This increases the opacity of
the outer layers and may trigger important mass loss by line driven winds. The
third effect is the fact that, during the main-sequence phase, stars, at very
low metallicity, reach more easily than their more metal rich counterparts, the
critical velocity\footnote{The critical velocity is the surface equatorial
velocity such that the centrifugal acceleration compensates for the local
gravity.}. We discuss the respective importance of these three effects as a
function of the metallicity. We show the consequences for the early chemical
evolution of the galactic halo and for explaining the CEMP stars. We conclude
that rotation is probably a key feature which contributes in an important way
to shape the evolution of the first stellar generations in the Universe.

flat or locally symmetric spaces of rank~1. This conjecture has been proved by
Z. Szab\'{o} \cite{Sz} for harmonic manifolds with compact universal cover. E.
Damek and F. Ricci \cite{DR} provided examples showing that in the noncompact
case the conjecture is wrong. However, such manifolds do not admit a compact
quotient.
  In this paper we study, using a notion of rank, the asymptotic geometry and
the geodesic flow on simply connected nonflat and noncompact harmonic manifolds
denoted by $X$. In the first part of the paper we show that the following
assertions are equivalent. The volume growth is purely exponential, the rank of
$X$ is one, the geodesic flow is Anosov with respect to the Sasaki metric, $X$
is Gromov hyperbolic. In the second part of the paper we show that the geodesic
flow is Anosov if $X$ is a nonflat harmonic manifold with no focal points. In
the course of the proof we obtain that certain partially hyperbolic flows on
arbitrary Riemannian manifolds without focal points are Anosov, which is of
interest beyond harmonic manifolds. Combining the results of this paper with
the rigidity theorem's of \cite{BCG}, \cite{BFL} and \cite{FL}, we confirm the
Lichnerowicz conjecture for all compact harmonic manifolds without focal points
or with Gromov hyperbolic fundamental groups.

the ferromagnetism. Below $T_{c}$, the ferromagnetism is enhanced by the p-wave

ferromagnetism is reduced by the strength of the p-wave pairing potential, and
the magnetization increases correspondingly. More important, our results
suggest that once Stoner ferromagnetism is established, $T_m$ is unlikely to

K-band observations in conjunction with B- and R-band photometry and a
subsample of ~650 galaxies spectroscopically confirmed supercluster members,
allowing to investigate the galaxies down to M_K^*+6 and M=10^8.75 M_sun. For
the 3 deg^2 field the K-band LF is described by a Schechter function with
M_K^*=-24.96+-0.10 and \alpha=-1.42+-0.03. We investigate the effect of
environment by deriving the LF in three regions selected according to the local
galaxy density, and observe a significant increase in the faint-end slope going
from the high- (\alpha=-1.33) to the low-density (\alpha=-1.49) environments.
The SMF is fitted well by a Schechter function with log_10(M^*)=11.16+-0.04 and
\alpha=-1.20+-0.02. The SMF of supercluster galaxies is also characterised by
an excess of massive galaxies that are associated to the cluster BCGs. While
the value of M* depends on environment the slope of the galaxy SMF does not
vary with the environment. By comparing our findings with cosmological
simulations, we conclude that the environmental dependences of the LF are not
primary due to variations in the merging histories, but to processes which are
not treated in the semi-analytical models, such as tidal stripping or
harassment. In field regions the SMF shows a sharp upturn below M=10^9 M_sun,
close to our mass limit, suggesting that the upturns seen in our K-band LFs,
but not in the SMF, are due to this dwarf population. The environmental
variations seen in the faint-end of the K-band LF suggests that dwarf galaxies,
which are easier to strip than their more massive counterparts, are affected by
tidal/gas stripping upon entering the supercluster.

Chen and Leipnik-Newton. The rotational, volume preserving part of the flow
preserves in time a family of two intersecting surfaces, the so called {\em
Nambu Hamiltonians}. They foliate the entire phase space and are, in turn,
deformed in time by Dissipation which represents their irrotational part of the
flow. It is given by the gradient of a scalar function and is responsible for
the emergence of the Strange Attractors.
  Based on our recent work on Quantum Nambu Mechanics, we provide an explicit
quantization of the Lorenz attractor through the introduction of
Non-commutative phase space coordinates as Hermitian $ N \times N $ matrices in
$ R^{3}$. They satisfy the commutation relations induced by one of the two
Nambu Hamiltonians, the second one generating a unique time evolution.
Dissipation is incorporated quantum mechanically in a self-consistent way
having the correct classical limit without the introduction of external degrees
of freedom. Due to its volume phase space contraction it violates the quantum
commutation relations. We demonstrate that the Heisenberg-Nambu evolution
equations for the Quantum Lorenz system give rise to an attracting ellipsoid in
the $3 N^{2}$ dimensional phase space.

emission lines in their optical spectra. We also include in our study the star
HD 245185, a known Herbig Ae object which displays excesses in all Spitzer
bands and shows emission lines in its spectrum. We compare the disk population
in the Lambda Orionis cluster with the disk census in other stellar groups
studied using similar methods to detect and characterize their disks and
spanning a range of ages from 3 Myr to 10 Myr. We find that for stellar groups
of 5 Myr or older the observed disk frequency in intermediate mass stars (with
spectral types from late B to early F) is higher than in low mass stars (with
spectral types K and M). This is in contradiction with the observed trend for
primordial disks evolution, in which stars with higher stellar masses dissipate
their primordial disks faster. At 3 Myr the observed disk frequency in
intermediate mass stars is still lower than for low mass stars indicating that
second generation dusty disks start to dominate the disk population at 5 Myr
for intermediate mass stars. This result agrees with recent models of evolution
of solids in the region of the disk where icy objects form (>30 AU), which
suggest that at 5-10 Myr collisions start to produce large amount of dust
during the transition from runaway to oligarchic growth (reaching sizes of ~500
km) and then dust production peaks at 10-30 Myr, when objects reach their

using a hydrodynamical model. It deals with the creation of Mach cones which
are supposed to exhibit a characteristic structure in the measured angular
particle distributions allowing for direct conclusions about the Equation of
State and in particular about the speed of sound of the medium. Several
different scenarios of jet energy loss are examined and different mechanisms of
energy and momentum loss are analyzed, ranging from weak interactions (based on
calculations from perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics, pQCD) to strong
interactions (formulated using the Anti-de-Sitter/Conformal Field Theory
Correspondence, AdS/CFT). Though they result in different angular particle
correlations which could in principle allow to distinguish the underlying
processes, it is shown that the characteristic structure observed in
experimental data can be obtained due to the different contributions of several
possible jet trajectories through an expanding medium. Such a structure cannot
directly be connected to the Equation of State. In this context, the impact of
a strong flow created behind the jet (the diffusion wake) is examined which is
common to almost all jet deposition scenarios. Besides that, the transport
equations for dissipative hydrodynamics are discussed which are fundamental for
any numerical computation of viscous effects in a Quark-Gluon Plasma.
