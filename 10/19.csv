disruption of accreted dwarf galaxies in a fully cosmological setting. Our
model is based on the Aquarius project, a suite of high resolution N-body
simulations of individual dark matter haloes. We tag subsets of particles in
these simulations with stellar populations predicted by the Galform
semi-analytic model. Our method self-consistently tracks the dynamical
evolution and disruption of satellites from high redshift. The luminosity
function and structural properties of surviving satellites, which agree well
with observations, suggest that this technique is appropriate. We find that
accreted stellar haloes are assembled between 1<z<7 from less than 5
significant progenitors. These progenitors are old, metal-rich satellites with
stellar masses similar to the brightest Milky Way dwarf spheroidals. In
contrast to previous stellar halo simulations, we find that several of these
major contributors survive as self-bound systems to the present day. Both the
number of these significant progenitors and their infall times are inherently
stochastic. This results in great diversity among our stellar haloes, which
amplifies small differences between the formation histories of their dark halo
hosts. The masses and density/surface-brightness profiles of the stellar haloes
are consistent with expectations from the Milky Way and M31. Each halo has a
complex structure, consisting of well-mixed components, tidal streams, shells
and other subcomponents. This structure is not adequately described by smooth
models. We find one example of an accreted thick disk. Contrasts in age and
metallicity between halo stars and those in surviving satellites are in broad
agreement with recent observations. [Abridged]

products of interactions of stars with the massive black hole(s) (MBH) in the
Galactic Center (GC). They are mainly B-type stars with their progenitors
unknown. OB stars are also populated in the GC, with many being hosted in a
clockwise-rotating young stellar (CWS) disk within half a parsec from the MBH
and their formation remaining puzzles. In this paper, we demonstrate that HVSs
can well memorize the injecting directions of their progenitors using both
analytical arguments and numerical simulations, i.e., the ejecting direction of
an HVS is almost anti-parallel to the injecting direction of its progenitor.
Therefore, the spatial distribution of HVSs maps the spatial distribution of
the parent population of their progenitors directly. We also find that almost
all the discovered HVSs are spatially consistent with being located on two thin
disk planes. The orientation of one plane is consistent with that of the
(inner) CWS disk, which suggests that most of the HVSs originate from the CWS
disk or a previously existed disk-like stellar structure with an orientation
similar to it. The rest of HVSs may be correlated with the plane of the
northern arm of the mini-spiral in the GC or the plane defined by the outer
warped part of the CWS disk. Our results not only support the GC origin of HVSs
but also imply that the central disk (or the disk structure with a similar
orientation) should persist or be frequently rejuvenated over the past 200 Myr,
which adds a new challenge to the stellar disk formation and provides insights
to the longstanding problem of gas fueling into massive black holes.

two inequivalent classes of genuine tripartite entanglement, namely the
GHZ-class and the W-class. Any two states within the same class can be
transformed into each other with stochastic local operations and classical
communication (SLOCC) with a non-zero probability. The optimal conversion
probability, however, is only known for special cases. Here, we derive new
lower and upper bounds for the optimal probability of transformation from a
GHZ-state to other states of the GHZ-class. A key idea in the derivation of the
upper bounds is to consider the action of the LOCC protocol on a different
input state, namely $1/\sqrt{2} [\ket{000} - \ket{111}]$, and demand that the
probability of an outcome remains bounded by 1. We also find an upper bound for
more general cases by using the constraints of the so-called interference term
and 3-tangle. Moreover, we generalize some of our results to the case where
each party holds a higher-dimensional system. In particular, we found that the
GHZ state generalized to three qutrits, i.e., $\ket{\mathrm{GHZ}_3} =
1/\sqrt{3} [ \ket{000} + \ket{111} + \ket{222} ] $, shared among three parties
can be transformed to {\it any} tripartite 3-qubit pure state with probability
1 via LOCC. Some of our results can also be generalized to the case of a

detection of detached inactive binaries harboring stellar mass black holes or

finite extensions of $\mathbb{Q}_p$, we give a sufficient condition on the
multiplier under which the corresponding linearization disc is maximal (i.e.
its radius coincides with that of the maximal disc in $\mathbb{C}_p$ on which
$f$ is one-to-one). In particular, in unramified extensions of $\mathbb{Q}_p$,
the linearization disc is maximal if the multiplier map has a maximal cycle on
the unit sphere. Estimates of linearization discs in the remaining types of
non-Archimedean fields of dimension one were obtained in
\cite{Lindahl:2004,Lindahl:2009,Lindahl:2009eq}.
  Moreover, it is shown that, for any complete non-Archimedean field,
transitivity is preserved under analytic conjugation. Using results by Oxtoby
\cite{Oxtoby:1952}, we prove that transitivity, and hence minimality, is
equivalent the unique ergodicity on compact subsets of a linearization disc. In
particular, a power series $f$ over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ is minimal, hence uniquely
ergodic, on all spheres inside a linearization disc about a fixed point if and
only if the multiplier is maximal. We also note that in finite extensions of
$\mathbb{Q}_p$, as well as in any other non-Archimedean field $K$ that is not

is used to detect the incoming phase distorted wavefront through local tilt
measurements made by recording the spot pattern near the focal plane. Wavefront
reconstruction is performed in two stages - (a) image centroiding to calculate
local slopes, (b) formation of the wavefront shape from local slope
measurement. Centroiding accuracy contributes to most of the wavefront
reconstruction error in Shack Hartmann sensor based adaptive optics system with
readout and background noise. It becomes even more difficult in atmospheric
adaptive optics case, where scintillation effects may also occur. In this paper
we used a denoising technique based on thresholded Zernike reconstructor to
minimize the effects due to readout and background noise. At low signal to
noise ratio, this denoising technique can be improved further by taking the
advantage of the shape of the spot. Assuming a Gaussian pattern for individual
spots, it is shown that the centroiding accuracy can be improved in the
presence of strong scintillations and background.

previously known solutions in the literature, e.g., the temporal and spatial
Schwarzschild solutions of braneworld theory as well as the class of self-dual
Lorenzian wormholes. A major departure of our solutions from Lorenzian
wormholes {\it a la} Morris and Thorne is that, for certain values of the
parameters of the solutions, they contain three spherical surfaces (instead of
one) which are extremal and have finite area. Two of them have the same size,
meet the ""flare-out"" requirements, and show the typical violation of the energy
conditions that characterizes a wormhole throat. The other extremal sphere is
""flaring-in"" in the sense that its sectional area is a local maximum and the
weak, null and dominant energy conditions are satisfied in its neighborhood.
After bouncing back at this second surface a traveler crosses into another
space which is the double of the one she/he started in. Another interesting
feature is that the size of the throat can be less than the Schwarzschild
radius $2 M$, which no longer defines the horizon, i.e., to a distant observer

discovered a partial X-ray eclipse in V893 Sco. This is the first time that a
partial eclipse is seen in X-ray light curves of a dwarf nova. Our preliminary
simulations demonstrate that the partial X-ray eclipse can be in principle
reproduced if the white dwarf in V893 Sco is partially eclipsed. Higher quality
observations of this object have the potential to place significant constraints
on the latitudinal extent of the X-ray emission region and thereby
discriminating between an equatorial boundary layer and a spherical corona. The
partial X-ray eclipse therefore makes V893 Sco a key object in understanding

spatially flat universe filled with ordinary matter undergoing a phase of
contraction reaches a stage of minimal expansion factor before bouncing in a
regular way to reach the expanding phase. The expansion can be connected to the
usual radiation- and matter-dominated epochs before reaching a final expanding
de Sitter phase. In general relativity (GR), a bounce can only take place
provided that the spatial sections are positively curved, a fact that has been
shown to translate into a constraint on the characteristic duration of the
bounce. In our model, on the other hand, a bounce can occur also in the absence
of spatial curvature, which means that the timescale for the bounce can be made
arbitrarily short or long. The implication is that constraints on the bounce
characteristic time obtained in GR rely heavily on the assumed theory of
gravity. Although the model we investigate is fourth order in the derivatives
of the metric (and therefore unstable vis-a-vis the perturbations), this
generic bounce dynamics should extend to string-motivated non singular models

direction into the observed cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature
field. In particular, we make a frequentist comparison of the one- and
two-point statistics for the dipole modulation and ACW models with data from
the five-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). This analysis is
motivated by previously revealed anomalies in the WMAP data, and particularly
the difference in the statistical nature of the temperature anisotropies when
analysed in hemispherical partitions.
  The analysis of the one-point statistics indicates that the previously
determined hemispherical variance difficulties can be apparently overcome by a
dipole modulation field, but new inconsistencies arise if the mean and the
l-dependence of the statistics are considered. The two-point correlation
functions of the local extrema, the temperature pair product and the
point-point spatial pair-count, demonstrate that the impact of such a
modulation is to over-`asymmetrise' the temperature field on smaller scales
than the wave-length of the dipole or quadrupole, and this is disfavored by the
observed data.The results from the ACW model predictions, however, are
consistent with the standard isotropic hypothesis. The two-point analysis
confirms that the impact of this type of violation of isotropy on the
temperature extrema statistics is relatively weak.
  From this work, we conclude that a model with more spatial structure than the
dipole modulated or rotational-invariance breaking models are required to fully
explain the observed large-scale anomalies in the WMAP data.

conventional, standard adiabatic quantum computation proceeds along
eigenenergies of parameter-dependent Hamiltonians. By contrast, discrete
adiabatic computation utilizes adiabatic passage along the quasienergies of
parameter-dependent unitary operators. For example, such computation can be
realized by a concatenation of parameterized quantum circuits, with an
adiabatic though inevitably discrete change of the parameter. A design
principle of adiabatic passage along quasienergy is recently proposed: Cheon's
quasienergy and eigenspace anholonomies on unitary operators is available to
realize anholonomic adiabatic algorithms [Tanaka and Miyamoto, Phys. Rev. Lett.
98, 160407 (2007)], which compose a nontrivial family of discrete adiabatic
algorithms. It is straightforward to port a standard adiabatic algorithm to an
anholonomic adiabatic one, except an introduction of a parameter |v>, which is
available to adjust the gaps of the quasienergies to control the running time
steps. In Grover's database search problem, the costs to prepare |v> for the
qualitatively different, i.e., power or exponential, running time steps are
shown to be qualitatively different. Curiously, in establishing the equivalence
between the standard quantum computation based on the circuit model and the
anholonomic adiabatic quantum computation model, it is shown that the cost for
|v> to enlarge the gaps of the eigenvalue is qualitatively negligible.

report the detection of a turbulent RM signal, with rms of 17 rad/m^2 and scale

whether this signal arises from turbulent structure throughout the lobe or only
in a thin skin (or sheath) around the edge, although we favour the latter. The
RM signal is modelled as possibly arising from a thin skin with a thermal
plasma density equivalent to the Centaurus intragroup medium density and a
coherent magnetic field that reverses its sign on a spatial scale of 20 kpc.

inclusion is motivated by the experimental signature of nematic order found in

obtain the Fermi surface topologies, without and with magnetic field
background, including the elastic scattering by impurities in the investigation
within t-matrix approximation framework. The topologies are found to be
distinct from the Fermi arc picture: we find that the minimally gapped portion
of Fermi surface forms closed loops (hole pockets) and not arcs. However, some
k-points of the electron pockets are found to be associated with the negative
density of state values (see Ref.[28]) when B and e are zero; for non-zero B
and e slightly positive these pockets acquire positive DOS values. The latter
thus seems to justify the inclusion of the hopping anisotropy in the
Hamiltonian. We relate these findings to QO in specific heat. We show that the
origin of the main frequency of the oscillations is the electron pocket of the
Fermi surface at a magnetic field B equal to 50 T.

time-of-flight and Cherenkov detectors to select a pure muon beam. A first
measurement of emittance is performed in the upstream magnetic spectrometer
with a scintillating fiber tracker. A cooling cell will then follow,
alternating energy loss in liquid hydrogen and acceleration by RF cavities. A
second spectrometer identical to the first and another particle identification
system provide a measurement of the outgoing emittance. In late 2009, it is
expected that the beam and many of the particle identification detectors will
be in the final commissioning phase, and the first measurement of input beam
emittance will take place in 2010. The steps of commissioning, emittance
measurement and cooling will be described.

The model is based on a sequence of stellar sub-populations described by the
star formation history (SFR) and the dynamical heating law (given by the
age-velocity dispersion relation AVR). The combination of kinematic data from
Hipparcos and the finite lifetimes of main sequence (MS) stars enables us to
determine the detailed vertical disc structure independent of individual
stellar ages and only weakly dependent on the IMF. The disc parameters are
determined by applying a sophisticated best fit algorithm to the MS star
velocity distribution functions in magnitude bins. We find that the AVR is well
constrained by the local kinematics, whereas for the SFR the allowed range is
larger. A simple chemical enrichment model is included in order to fit the
local metallicity distribution of G dwarfs. In our favoured model A the power
law index of the AVR is 0.375 with a minimum and maximum velocity dispersion of
5.1 km/s and 25.0 km/s, respectively. The SFR shows a maximum 10 Gyr ago and
declines by a factor of four to the present day value of 1.5 M_sun/pc^2/Gyr. A
best fit of the IMF leads to power-law indices of -1.46 below and -4.16 above
1.72 M_sun avoiding a kink at 1 M_sun. An isothermal thick disc component with
local density of ~6% of the stellar density is included. A thick disc
containing more than 10% of local stellar mass is inconsistent with the local
kinematics of K and M dwarfs.

nulling interferometry as one of the most promising techniques. The ability to
study distant planets will however depend on exozodiacal dust clouds
surrounding the target stars. In this paper, we assess the impact of
exozodiacal dust clouds on the performance of an infrared nulling
interferometer in the Emma X-array configuration. For the nominal mission
architecture with 2-m aperture telescopes, we found that point-symmetric
exozodiacal dust discs about 100 times denser than the solar zodiacal cloud can
be tolerated in order to survey at least 150 targets during the mission
lifetime. Considering modeled resonant structures created by an Earth-like
planet orbiting at 1 AU around a Sun-like star, we show that the tolerable dust
density for planet detection goes down to about 15 times the solar zodiacal
density for face-on systems and decreases with the disc inclination. The upper
limits on the tolerable exozodiacal dust density derived in this study must be
considered as rather pessimistic, but still give a realistic estimation of the
typical sensitivity that we will need to reach on exozodiacal discs in order to

question of global existence of extremal black holes in the $D$-dimensional
Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton theory with the Gauss-Bonnet term introducing a
variable dilaton coupling $a$ as a parameter. We show that asymptotically flat
black holes exist only in a bounded region of the dilaton couplings $0 < a <

$r = r_{\rm cusp}$ (spherical cusps), where the scalar curvature diverges as
$|r - r_{\rm cusp}|^{-1/2}$. For $D \geq 7$ cusps are met in pairs, so that
solutions can be formally extended to asymptotically flat infinity choosing a
suitable integration variable. We show, however, that radial geodesics cannot

to track changes in the complete network state. As a result, nodes have to make
distributed decisions about their transmission and reception parameters based
on their local view of the network. In this paper, we characterize the impact
of distributed decisions on the global network performance in terms of
achievable sum-rates. We first formalize the concept of local view by proposing
a protocol abstraction using the concept of local message passing. In the
proposed protocol, nodes forward information about the network state to other
neighboring nodes, thereby allowing network state information to trickle to all
the nodes. The protocol proceeds in rounds, where all transmitters send a
message followed by a message by all receivers. The number of rounds then
provides a natural metric to quantify the extent of local information at each
node.
  We next study three network connectivities, Z-channel, a three-user double
Z-channel and a reduced-parametrization $K$-user stacked Z-channel. In each
case, we characterize achievable sum-rate with partial message passing leading
to three main results. First, in many cases, nodes can make distributed
decisions with only local information about the network and can still achieve
the same sum-capacity as can be attained with global information irrespective
of the actual channel gains. Second, for the case of three-user double
Z-channel, we show that universal optimality is not achievable if the per node
information is below a threshold. Third, using reduced parametrization $K$-user
channel, we show that very few protocol rounds are needed for the case of very
weak or very strong interference.

Necessary conditions with cut-set interpretation are presented. A \emph{Joint

decoding at each receiver is done with respect to an ordered partition of other
nodes. For each ordered partition a set of feasibility constraints is derived.
Then, utilizing the sub-modular property of the entropy function and a novel
geometrical approach, the results of different ordered partitions are
consolidated, which lead to sufficient conditions for our problem. The proposed
scheme achieves operational separation between source coding and channel
coding. It is shown that sufficient conditions are indeed necessary conditions
in two special cooperative networks, namely, Aref network and finite-field
deterministic network. Also, in Gaussian cooperative networks, it is shown that
reliable transmission of all DMCS whose Slepian-Wolf region intersects the
cut-set bound region within a constant number of bits, is feasible. In

target, HD 174884, led to the discovery that this star is an astrophysically
important double-lined eclipsing spectroscopic binary in an eccentric orbit (e
of about 0.3), unusual for its short (3.65705d) orbital period. The high
eccentricity, coupled with the orientation of the binary orbit in space,
explains the very unusual observed light curve with strongly unequal primary
and secondary eclipses having the depth ratio of 1-to-100 in the CoRoT 'seismo'
passband. Without the high accuracy of the CoRoT photometry, the secondary
eclipse, 1.5 mmag deep, would have gone unnoticed. A spectroscopic follow-up
program provided 45 high dispersion spectra. The analysis of the CoRoT light
curve was performed with an adapted version of PHOEBE that supports CoRoT
passbands. The final solution was obtained by simultaneous fitting of the light
and the radial velocity curves. Individual star spectra were derived by
spectrum disentangling. The uncertainties of the fit were derived by bootstrap
resampling and the solution uniqueness was tested by heuristic scanning. The
results provide a consistent picture of the system composed of two late B
stars. The Fourier analysis of the light curve fit residuals yields two
components, with orbital frequency multiples and an amplitude of about 0.1
mmag, which are tentatively interpreted as tidally induced pulsations. An
extensive comparison with theoretical models is carried out by means of the
Levenberg-Marquardt minimization technique and the discrepancy between models
and the derived parameters is discussed. The best fitting models yield a young
system age of 125 million years which is consistent with the eccentric orbit
and synchronous component rotation at periastron.

with two successive magnetic transitions at $T_{\rm N1}$ = 17 K and $T_{\rm

$^{151}$Eu M\""ossbauer measurements. The isothermal magnetization data for $H

phase diagram has been constructed from the temperature dependence of

  We present a theory of manifolds with corners which includes a new notion of
smooth map f : X --> Y. Compared to other definitions, our theory has the
advantage of giving a category Man^c of manifolds with corners which is
particularly well behaved as a category: it has products and direct products,
boundaries behave in a functorial way, and there are simple conditions for the
existence of fibre products X x_Z Y in Man^c.
  Our theory is tailored to future applications in Symplectic Geometry, and is
part of a project to describe the geometric structure on moduli spaces of
J-holomorphic curves in a new way. But we have written it as a separate paper

study the high mass star formation activity of normal late-type galaxies. The
data are corrected for dust attenuation using the most accurate techniques at
present available, namely the Balmer decrement and the total far-infrared to
FUV flux ratio. The sample shows a highly dispersed distribution in the Halpha
to FUV flux ratio indicating that two of the most commonly used star formation
tracers give star formation rates with uncertainties up to a factor of 2-3. The
high dispersion is due to the presence of AGN, where the UV and the Halpha
emission can be contaminated by nuclear activity, highly inclined galaxies, for
which the applied extinction corrections are probably inaccurate, or starburst
galaxies, where the stationarity in the star formation history required for
transforming Halpha and UV luminosities into star formation rates is not
satisfied. Excluding these objects we reach an uncertainty of ~50% on the SFR.
The Halpha to FUV flux ratio increases with their total stellar mass. If
limited to normal star forming galaxies, however, this relationship reduces to
a weak trend that might be totally removed using different extinction
correction recipes. In these objects the Halpha to FUV flux ratio seems also
barely related with the FUV-H colour, the H band effective surface brightness,
the total star formation activity and the gas fraction. The data are consistent
with a Kroupa and Salpeter initial mass function in the high mass stellar range
and imply, for a Salpeter IMF, that the variations of the slope cannot exceed
0.25, from g=2.35 for massive galaxies to g=2.60 in low luminosity systems. We
show however that these observed trends, if real, can be due to the different
micro history of star formation in massive galaxies with respect to dwarf.

Monte Carlo data are also used to check the accuracy of static properties

interactions slow down both the long-time and the short-time decays of the
intermediate scattering function $S(q,t)$, for wavevectors close to the peak of
the static structure factor $S(q)$, by a factor of roughly two. The long-time
slowing is diminished at high interaction strengths whereas the short-time
slowing (quantified via the hydrodynamic factor $H(q)$) is less affected by the
dipolar interactions, despite their strong effect on the pair distribution

back to interactions between the hard parton shower and the soft bulk matter.
Physical intuition suggests that the medium modification should cease to be
important when the hard scale of parton production is much larger than the
typical momentum scale in the medium (e.g. the temperature T) and that
consequently R_AA(P_T) -> 1 for P_T >> T. However, R_AA is not a 'simple'
observable, but rather results from many different mechanisms which influence
what happens when P_T increases. In particular, R_AA does not necessarily
approch unity even if the hadron momentum is probed at the kinematic limit of
the reaction. The aim of this work is to identify and discuss such mechanisms
and to present different model expectations of what one would find if one could
measure suppression out to the kinematic limit for hard hadron production and

relativistic slim accretion disks are investigated in this work. The resulting
emergent spectra are calculated using the relativistic ray-tracing method, in
which we neglect the self-irradiation of the accretion disk. The angular
dependence of the disk luminosity, the effects of the heat advection and the
disk thickness on the estimation of the black hole spin are discussed. Compare
to the previous works, our improvements are that we use the self-consistent
disk equations and we consider the disk self-shadowing effect. We find that at
the moderate accretion rate, the radiation trapped in the outer region of the
accretion disks will escape in the inner region of the accretion disk and
contribute to the emergent spectra. At the high accretion rate, for the large
inclination and large black hole spin, both the disk thickness and the heat
advection have significant influence on the emergent spectra. Consequently,
these effects will influence the measurement of the black hole spin based on
the spectra fitting and influence the angular dependence of the luminosity. For
the disks around Kerr black holes with $a=0.98$, if the disk inclination is
greater than $60^\circ$, and their luminosity is beyond 0.2 Eddington
luminosity, the spectral model which is based on the relativistic standard
accretion disk is no longer applicable for the spectra fitting. We also confirm
that the effect of the self-shadowing is significantly enhanced by the
light-bending, which implies that the non-relativistic treatment of the
self-shadowing is inaccurate. According to our results, the observed luminosity
dependence of the measured spin suggests that the disk self-shadowing
significantly shapes the spectra of GRS 1915+105, which might lead to the
underestimation of the black hole spin for the high luminosity states.

speed occurs has advanced approximately 90 degrees in 25 years. Aims. To
examine the possibility that these variations are associated with a mildly

Methods. The advance of the orbital phase for maximum speed is taken to be
advance of the apses of the putative elliptical orbit. It is compared with

gravitational perturbations from the circumbinary disc. These calculations are
made in the light of recent results on the SS 433 system. Results. The 13 day

accrete from the dense molecular interstellar medium during the period between

may span several Myr, the amount of material accreted can rival the amount in
the initial protoplanetary disk; the potential importance of this `tail-end'
accretion for planet formation was recently highlighted by Throop & Bally
(2008). While accretion onto a point mass is successfully modeled by the
classical Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton solutions, the more complicated case of
accretion onto a star-disk system defies analytic solution. In this paper we
investigate via direct hydrodynamic simulations the accretion of dense
interstellar material onto a star with an associated gaseous protoplanetary
disk. We discuss the changes to the structure of the accretion flow caused by
the disk, and vice versa. We find that immersion in a dense accretion flow can
redistribute disk material such that outer disk migrates inwards, increasing
the inner disk surface density and reducing the outer radius. The accretion
flow also triggers the development of spiral density features, and changes to
the disk inclination. The mean accretion rate onto the star remains roughly the
same with and without the presence of a disk. We discuss the potential impact
of this process on planet formation, including the possibility of triggered
gravitational instability; inclination differences between the disk and the
star; and the appearance of spiral structure in a gravitationally stable

report that for one- and two-dimensional phase space, in the transition from no
chaos to chaos -- as a parameter is varied -- there must be infinitely many
cascades under some mild hypotheses. Our meaning of chaos includes the case of
chaotic sets which are not attractors. Numerical studies indicate that this
result applies to the forced-damped pendulum and the forced Duffing equations,
viewing the solutions once each period of the forcing. We further show that in
many cases cascades appear in pairs connected (in joint parameter-state space)
by an unstable periodic orbit. Paired cascades can be destroyed or created by
perturbations, whereas unpaired cascades are conserved under even significant
perturbations.

Ultimately, one would like to gain a mechanistic understanding of the effects
of DNA binding events on gene expression. We present a free, open-source R

equation proposed by some physicists. This modification is obtained by adding
the second time derivative of the order parameter multiplied by an inertial
coefficient which is usually small in comparison to the other physical
constants. The main feature of this equation is the fact that even a globally
bounded nonlinearity is ""supercritical"" in the case of two and three space
dimensions. Thus the standard methods used for studying semilinear hyperbolic
equations are not very effective in the present case. Nevertheless, we have
recently proven the global existence and dissipativity of strong solutions in
the 2D case (with a cubic controlled growth nonlinearity) and for the 3D case
with small inertial coefficient and arbitrary growth rate of the nonlinearity.
The present contribution studies the long-time behavior of rather weak (energy)
solutions of that equation and it is a natural complement of the results of our
previous papers. Namely, we prove here that the attractors for energy and
strong solutions coincide for both the cases mentioned above. Thus, the energy
solutions are asymptotically smooth. In addition, we show that the non-smooth
part of any energy solution decays exponentially in time and deduce that the
(smooth) exponential attractor for the strong solutions constructed previously
is simultaneously the exponential attractor for the energy solutions as well.

fluctuations of the transverse momentum of the produced particles, p_T. Our
results demonstrate that practically all of the observed event-by-event p_T

agents. Thus, strong agents duplicate when reaching a critical amount of
resources, whereas weak agents die when loosing all their resources. To capture

reactions, molecular dissociation and evaporation processes. We present
experimental studies on the interaction of heavy, highly charged and energetic
ions (46 MeV Ni^13+) with ammonia-containing ices in an attempt to simulate the
physical chemistry induced by heavy ion cosmic rays inside dense astrophysical
environments. The measurements were performed inside a high vacuum chamber
coupled to the heavy ion accelerator GANIL (Grand Accelerateur National d'Ions
Lourds) in Caen, France.\textit{In-situ} analysis is performed by a Fourier
transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) at different fluences. The averaged
values for the dissociation cross section of water, ammonia and carbon monoxide
due to heavy cosmic ray ion analogs are ~2x10^{-13}, 1.4x10^{-13} and
1.9x10^{-13} cm$^2$, respectively. In the presence of a typical heavy cosmic
ray field, the estimated half life for the studied species is 2-3x10^6 years.
The ice compaction (micropore collapse) due to heavy cosmic rays seems to be at
least 3 orders of magnitude higher than the one promoted by (0.8 MeV) protons .
In the case of the irradiated H2O:NH3:CO ice, the infrared spectrum at room
temperature reveals five bands that were tentatively assigned to vibration
modes of the zwitterionic glycine (+NH3CH2COO-).

ferroelectric properties of prototypical \textit{proper} and \textit{improper}
multiferroic (MF) systems such as BiFeO$_{3}$ and orthorhombic HoMnO$_{3}$,
respectively, within density functional theory (DFT) and using the
Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof hybrid functional (HSE). By comparing our results with
available experimental data as well as with state-of-the-art GW calculations,
we show that the HSE formalism is able to account well for the relevant
properties of these compounds and it emerges as an accurate tool for predictive
first-principles investigations on multiferroic systems. We show that effects
beyond local and semilocal DFT approaches (as provided by HSE) are necessary
for a realistic description of MFs. For the electric polarization, a decrease
is found for MFs with magnetically-induced ferroelectricity, such as HoMnO$_3$,
where the calculated polarization changes from $\sim$ 6 $\mu C/cm^2$ using
Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) to $\sim$ 2 $\mu C/cm^2$ using HSE. However, for
\textit{proper} MFs, such as BiFeO$_{3}$, the polarization slightly increases
upon introduction of exact exchange. Our findings therefore suggest that a
general trend for the HSE correction to bare density functional cannot be
extracted; rather, a specific investigation has to be carried out on each
compound.

in-situ x-ray specular reflectivity and surface diffuse x-ray scattering.
Unlike prior reflectivity-based studies, these measurements access both the
time- and the length-scales of the evolution of the surface morphology during
growth. In particular, we show that this technique allows direct measurements
of the diffusivity for both inter- and intra-layer transport. Our results
explicitly limit the possible role of island break-up, demonstrate the key
roles played by nucleation and coarsening in PLD, and place an upper bound on
the Ehrlich-Schwoebel (ES) barrier for downhill diffusion.
