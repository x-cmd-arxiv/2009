masses of pair-produced, semi-invisibly decaying particles at hadron colliders.
We define two new transverse kinematic variables, $M_{CT_\perp}$ and
$M_{CT_\parallel}$, which are suitable one-dimensional projections of the
contransverse mass $M_{CT}$. We derive analytical formulas for the boundaries
of the kinematically allowed regions in the $(M_{CT_\perp},M_{CT_\parallel})$
and $(M_{CT_\perp},M_{CT})$ parameter planes, and introduce suitable variables
$D_{CT_\parallel}$ and $D_{CT}$ to measure the distance to those boundaries on
an event per event basis. We show that the masses can be reliably extracted
from the endpoint measurements of $M_{CT_\perp}^{max}$ and $D_{CT}^{min}$ (or
$D_{CT_\parallel}^{min}$). We illustrate our method with dilepton $t\bar{t}$
events at the LHC.

number of e-folds of slow-roll post-eternal inflation. For simplest models of
chaotic inflation, N is approximately equal to de Sitter entropy at the end of
eternal inflation; it can be exponentially large. However, not all of these
universes can be observed by a local observer. In the presence of a
cosmological constant \Lambda the number of distinguishable universes is
bounded by e^{|\Lambda|^{-3/4}}. In the context of the string theory landscape,
the overall number of different universes is expected to be exponentially
greater than the total number of vacua in the landscape. We discuss the
possibility that the strongest constraint on the number of distinguishable

then calculated the level populations and intensity distributions. These

of the RADEX code. H2O, NH3 and 13CO show emission from an extended PDR with a
narrow line width of ~3 kms. Like CO, the water line profile is dominated by
outflow emission, however, mainly in the red wing. The PDR model suggests that
the water emission mainly arises from the surfaces of optically thick, high
density clumps with n(H2)>10^6 cm^-3 and a clump water abundance, with respect
to H2, of 5x10^-8. The mean water abundance in the PDR is 5x10^-9, and between
~2x10^-8 -- 2x10^-7 in the outflow derived from a simple two-level
approximation. Ammonia is also observed in the extended clumpy PDR, likely from
the same high density and warm clumps as water. The average ammonia abundance
is about the same as for water: 4x10^-9 and 8x10^-9 given by the PDR model and
RADEX, respectively. The similarity of water and ammonia PDR emission is also
seen in the almost identical line profiles observed close to the bright rim.
Around the central position, ammonia also shows some outflow emission although
weaker than water in the red wing. Predictions of the H2O(110-101) and

and size in determining the structure and thermodynamics of bulk anion
hydration for the Hofmeister series Cl$^-$, Br$^-$, and I$^-$. Excellent
agreement with experiment is obtained for whole salt hydration free energies
using the polarizable AMOEBA force field. The quasi-chemical approach exactly
partitions the solvation free energy into inner-shell, outer-shell packing, and
outer-shell long-ranged contributions by means of a hard-sphere condition.
Small conditioning radii, even well inside the first maximum of the
ion-water(oxygen) radial distribution function, result in Gaussian behavior for
the long-ranged contribution that dominates the ion hydration free energy. The
spatial partitioning allows for a mean-field treatment of the long-ranged
contribution, leading to a natural division into first-order electrostatic,
induction, and van der Waals terms. The induction piece exhibits the strongest
ion polarizability dependence, while the larger-magnitude first-order
electrostatic piece yields an opposing but weaker polarizability dependence. In
addition, a structural analysis is performed to examine the solvation
anisotropy around the anions. As opposed to the hydration free energies, the
solvation anisotropy depends more on ion polarizability than on ion size:
increased polarizability leads to increased anisotropy. The water dipole
moments near the ion are similar in magnitude to bulk water, while the ion
dipole moments are found to be significantly larger than those observed in
quantum mechanical studies. Possible impacts of the observed over-polarization
of the ions on simulated anion surface segregation are discussed.

observed suppression of flavour-changing processes suggests that fermion masses
should arise via mixing of elementary fermions with composite fermions of the

composite leptoquark states, arising either as TeV scale resonances, or even as
light, pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons. The latter, since they are coupled to
colour, get a mass of the order of several hundred GeV, beyond the reach of

flavour-changing processes suppresses leptoquark-mediated rare processes,
making it conceivable that the many stringent constraints may be evaded. The
leptoquarks couple predominantly to third-generation quarks and leptons, and
the prospects for discovery at LHC appear to be good. As an illustration, a

calculations are performed on an ensemble of configurations obtained from
molecular dynamics simulations of a single chloride ion in bulk water. The
simulations utilize the polarizable AMOEBA force field for trajectory
generation, and MP2-level calculations are performed to examine the electronic
structure properties of the ions and surrounding waters in the external field
of more distant waters. The ChelpG method is employed to explore the effective
charges and dipoles on the chloride ions and first-shell waters. The Quantum
Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) is further utilized to examine charge
transfer from the anion to surrounding water molecules.
  From the QTAIM analysis, 0.2 elementary charges are transferred from the ion
to the first-shell water molecules. The default AMOEBA model overestimates the
average dipole moment magnitude of the ion compared with the estimated quantum
mechanical value. The average magnitude of the dipole moment of the water
molecules in the first shell treated at the MP2 level, with the more distant
waters handled with an AMOEBA effective charge model, is 2.67 D. This value is
close to the AMOEBA result for first-shell waters (2.72 D) and is slightly
reduced from the bulk AMOEBA value (2.78 D). The magnitude of the dipole moment
of the water molecules in the first solvation shell is most strongly affected

structures of the universe, such as galaxies and clusters of galaxies, for
example, a way to probe and constrain alternative theories, in the weak field
limit, is to apply them to model the structures of the universe. We then
modified the well known Gadget-2 code to probe alternative theories of
gravitation through galactic dynamics. In particular, we modified the Gadget-2
code to probe alternatives theories whose weak field limits have a Yukawa-like
gravitational potential. As a first application of this modified Gadget-2 code
we simulate the evolution of elliptical galaxies. These simulations show that
galactic dynamics can be used to constrain the parameters associated with
alternative theories of gravitation.

pressure balance at the boundary to the non-magnetic external medium. Formally,
such an approximation is justified if the diameter of the structure (a flux
tube or a flux sheet) is small compared to all other relevant length scales

3D radiative MHD simulations opens the possibility of checking the consistency
of the approximation with the properties of the flux concentrations that form
in the course of a simulation.
  We carry out a comparative analysis between the thin flux tube/sheet models

distribution of the vertical and horizontal components of the magnetic field in
a 3D MHD simulation with the field distribution in the case of the thin flux

physical events or underlying quantum mechanical properties. The phase diagram
of the newly discovered iron arsenic high temperature superconductors is
particularly rich and interesting. In the AE(Fe1-xTx)2As2 class (AE being Ca,
Sr, Ba, T being transition metals), the simultaneous structural/magnetic phase
transition that occurs at elevated temperature in the undoped material, splits
and is suppressed by carrier doping, the suppression being complete around
optimal doping. A dome of superconductivity exists with apparent equal ease in
the orthorhombic / antiferromagnetic (AFM) state as well as in the tetragonal
state with no long range magnetic order. The question then is what determines
the critical doping at which superconductivity emerges, if the AFM order is
fully suppressed only at higher doping values. Here we report evidence from
angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) that critical changes in the
Fermi surface (FS) occur at the doping level that marks the onset of
superconductivity. The presence of the AFM order leads to a reconstruction of
the electronic structure, most significantly the appearance of the small hole
pockets at the Fermi level. These hole pockets vanish, i. e. undergo a Lifshitz
transition, at the onset of superconductivity. Superconductivity and magnetism
are competing states in the iron arsenic superconductors. In the presence of
the hole pockets superconductivity is fully suppressed, while in their absence
the two states can coexist.

data-set of size $N$ and a depth $h$ of the hierarchical strategy. For a

$N^{(2-d)/(h+1)d}$. Finally, under some conditions we observe that there is a
value $s^*$ of the penalty coefficient, a free parameter used to fix the number
of clusters, which separates a fragmentation phase (for $s<s^*$) from a
coalescent one (for $s>s^*$) of the underlying hidden cluster structure. At

with an exponential law, with a possible depletion of CCSNe within one-fifth of
the isophotal radius. The scale length of the distribution of type II SNe
appears to be significantly larger than that of the stellar disks of their host
galaxies, but consistent with the scale lengths of Freeman disks. SNe Ib/c have
a significantly smaller scale length than SNe II, with little difference
between types Ib and Ic. The radial distribution of type Ib/c SNe is more
centrally concentrated than that of the stars in a Freeman disk, but is similar
to the stellar disk distribution that we infer for the host galaxies. The scale
length of the CCSN radial distribution shows no significant correlation with
the host galaxy morphological type, or the presence of bars. However, low
luminosity as well as inclined hosts have a less concentrated distribution of
CCSNe, which are probably a consequence of metallicity and selection effects,
respectively. The exponential distribution of CCSNe shows a scale length
consistent with that of the ionized gas confirming the generally accepted
hypothesis that the progenitors of these SNe are young massive stars. Given the
lack of correlation of the normalized radial distances of CCSNe with the
morphological type of the host galaxy, we conclude that the more concentrated
distribution of SNe Ib/c relative to SNe II must arise from the higher
metallicity of their progenitors or possibly from a shallower initial mass
function in the inner regions of spirals.

similar intrinsic opening angle distributions, based on a smaller subset of

preferentially smaller angles to the line of sight resulting in a stronger
relativistic beaming. The intrinsic jet opening angle and bulk flow Lorentz
factor are found to be inversely proportional, as predicted by standard models
of compact relativistic jets. If a gas dynamical jet acceleration model is
assumed, the ratio of the initial pressure of the plasma in the core region P_0

unique laboratory of molecular astrophysics in a chemically rich, massive star

due to the absorption by water and oxygen, the terrestrial atmosphere is
completely opaque at frequencies around 487 and 557 GHz. To cover these
frequencies we used the Odin satellite to perform a spectral line survey in the

spectral scans. Odin's high main beam efficiency and observations performed
outside the atmosphere make our intensity scale very well determined. We
observed 280 spectral lines from 38 molecules including isotopologues, and, in
addition, 64 unidentified lines. The beam-averaged emission is dominated by CO,
H2O, SO2, SO, 13CO and CH3OH. Species with the largest number of lines are
CH3OH, (CH33)2O, SO2, 13CH3OH, CH3CN and NO. Six water lines are detected

ratios of D/H, 12C/13C, 32S/34S, 34S/33S, and 18O/17O are estimated. The
temperatures, column densities and abundances in the various subregions are

powerful means of 3D characterization, exhibits some analogy with that of
glasses which led to call them soft glassy materials. However, despite its
importance for geophysical and industrial applications, their rheological
behavior, and its microscopic origin, is still poorly known, in particular
because of its nonlinear nature. Here we show from two original experiments
that a simple 3D continuum description of the behaviour of soft glassy
materials can be built. We first show that when a flow is imposed in some
direction there is no yield resistance to a secondary flow: these systems are
always unjammed simultaneously in all directions of space. The 3D jamming
criterion appears to be the plasticity criterion encountered in most solids. We
also find that they behave as simple liquids in the direction orthogonal to
that of the main flow; their viscosity is inversely proportional to the main
flow shear rate, as a signature of shear-induced structural relaxation, in
close similarity with the structural relaxations driven by temperature and
density in other glassy systems.

their derivation. By keeping only the lowest order in collinearity terms,
models based on the opacity expansion have ~50% systematic uncertainty in the
calculation of pi^0 R_AA in 0-5% most central RHIC collisions resulting in a
systematic uncertainty of ~200% in the extracted medium density. Surprisingly,
the inclusion of a thermal gluon mass on the order of the Debye screening scale
affects R_AA at only about the 5% level due to non-intuitive coherence effects.
For some observables such as R_AA, the effect of these uncertainties decreases
with increasing jet energy; for others, such as the average number of radiated
gluons, the effect is energy independent. We note that it is likely that the
differences reported in the extracted values of medium parameters such as qhat
by various jet energy loss models will fall within this collinear approximation
systematic uncertainty; it is imperative for the quantitative extraction of
medium parameters or the possible falsification of the hypothesis of weak
coupling between the hard probes and soft modes of the quark gluon plasma
medium that future radiative energy loss research push beyond the lowest order
collinear approximation.

simultaneously observed different 1.1 GHz bands using frequency steps of 0.5
GHz (25 hours each). An on-source integration time of 20 hours was achieved for
most bands. The entire campaign consumed ~1100 orbits, each containing one hour
of serviceable astro-observation. We identified 280 spectral lines from 38
known interstellar molecules (including isotopologues) having intensities in

progress in this direction by introducing a provably optimal method for the

on generalizing the notion of the Buneman graph, a construction key to
efficient exact methods for binary sequences, so as to apply to sequences with
arbitrary finite numbers of states with arbitrary state transition weights. We
implement an integer linear programming (ILP) method for the multi-state

method is able to solve data sets that are intractable by prior exact methods

Spectroscopic redshifts were obtained for 15 DRGs. Only 2 out of 15 DRGs are
located at z < 2, suggesting a high efficiency to select high-redshift sources.
  From other spectroscopic surveys in the CDFS targeting intermediate to high
redshift populations selected with different criteria, we find spectroscopic
redshifts for a further 30 DRGs. We use the sample of spectroscopically
confirmed DRGs to establish the high quality (scatter in \Delta z/(1+z) of ~
0.05) of their photometric redshifts in the considered deep fields, as derived
with EAZY (Brammer et al. 2008). Combining the spectroscopic and photometric
redshifts, we find that 74% of DRGs with K < 22.5 lie at z > 2. The combined
spectroscopic and photometric sample is used to analyze the distinct intrinsic
and observed properties of DRGs at z < 2 and z > 2. In our photometric sample
to K < 22.5, low-redshift DRGs are brighter in K than high-redshift DRGs by 0.7
mag, and more extincted by 1.2 mag in Av. Our analysis shows that the DRG
criterion selects galaxies with different properties at different redshifts.
Such biases can be largely avoided by selecting galaxies based on their
rest-frame properties, which requires very good multi-band photometry and high

to constrain the chemical composition of the ultra-high energy cosmic ray
(UHECR) spectrum. In particular, the PAO's measurements of the average depth of
shower maximum and the fluctuations of the depth of shower maximum indicate
that the cosmic ray spectrum is dominated by a fairly narrow distribution (in
charge) of heavy or intermediate mass nuclei at the highest measured energies
(E > 10^{19} eV), and contains mostly lighter nuclei or protons at lower
energies (E ~ 10^{18} eV). In this article, we study the propagation of UHECR
nuclei with the goal of using these measurements, along with those of the shape
of the spectrum, to constrain the chemical composition of the particles
accelerated by the sources of the UHECRs. We find that with modest
intergalactic magnetic fields, 0.3 nG in strength with 1 Mpc coherent lengths,
good fits to the combined PAO data can be found for the case in which the
sources accelerate primarily intermediate mass nuclei (such as nitrogen or
silicon). Without intergalactic magnetic fields, we do not find any composition
scenarios that can accommodate the PAO data. For a spectrum dominated by heavy

observed faint end of the optical and X-ray QLFs (the bright end is not
accessible in our simulated volumes) at z < 2. At higher redshifts our
simulations tend to overestimate the QLF at the faintest luminosities. We show
that although the low (high) luminosity ranges of the faint-end QLF are
dominated by low (high) mass black holes, a wide range of black hole masses
still contributes to any given luminosity range. This is consistent with the
complex lightcurves of black holes resulting from the detailed hydrodynamics
followed in the simulations. Consistent with the results on the QLFs, we find
good agreement for the evolution of the comoving number density (in optical,
soft and hard X-ray bands) of AGN for luminosities above 10^43 erg/s. However,
the luminosity density evolution from the simulation appears to imply a peak at
higher redshift than constrained from hard X-ray data (but not in optical). Our
predicted excess at the faintest fluxes at z >= 2 does not lead to an
overestimate to the total X-ray background and its contribution is at most a
factor of two larger than the unresolved fraction of the 2-8 keV background.
Even though this could be explained by some yet undetected, perhaps heavily
obscured faint quasar population, we show that our predictions for the faint

features of the transitions. It is suggested that these features define classes

instabilities : the shear-thickening found in the dilute regime, the
shear-banding which is linked in some systems to the isotropic-to-nematic
transition, and the flow-aligning and tumbling instabilities characteristic of
nematic structures. In these three classes of behaviors, the shear-induced
transitions are the result of a coupling between the internal structure of the

important model from statistical mechanics which describes a system of
interacting particles hopping left and right on a one-dimensional lattice of n
sites with open boundaries. It has been cited as a model for traffic flow and
protein synthesis. In the most general form of the ASEP with open boundaries,
particles may enter and exit at the left with probabilities alpha and gamma,
and they may exit and enter at the right with probabilities beta and delta. In
the bulk, the probability of hopping left is q times the probability of hopping
right. The first main result of this paper is a combinatorial formula for the
stationary distribution of the ASEP with all parameters general, in terms of a
new class of tableaux which we call staircase tableaux. This generalizes our
previous work for the ASEP with parameters gamma=delta=0. Using our first
result and also results of Uchiyama-Sasamoto-Wadati, we derive our second main
result: a combinatorial formula for the moments of Askey-Wilson polynomials.
Since the early 1980's there has been a great deal of work giving combinatorial
formulas for moments of various other classical orthogonal polynomials (e.g.
Hermite, Charlier, Laguerre, Meixner). However, this is the first such formula
for the Askey-Wilson polynomials, which are at the top of the hierarchy of
classical orthogonal polynomials.

will be first dedicated to the detection of B-mode polarization fluctuations in
the Cosmic Microwave Background. A bolometric interferometer will have to take
advantage of the wide spectral detection band of its bolometers in order to be
competitive with imaging experiments. A crucial concern is that interferometers
are presumed to be importantly affected by a spoiling effect known as bandwidth
smearing. In this paper, we investigate how the bandwidth modifies the work
principle of a bolometric interferometer and how it affects its sensitivity to
the CMB angular power spectra. We obtain analytical expressions for the
broadband visibilities measured by broadband heterodyne and bolometric
interferometers. We investigate how the visibilities must be reconstructed in a
broadband bolometric interferometer and show that this critically depends on
hardware properties of the modulation phase shifters. Using an angular power
spectrum estimator accounting for the bandwidth, we finally calculate the
sensitivity of a broadband bolometric interferometer. A numerical simulation
has been performed and confirms the analytical results. We conclude (i) that
broadband bolometric interferometers allow broadband visibilities to be
reconstructed whatever the kind of phase shifters used and (ii) that for
dedicated B-mode bolometric interferometers, the sensitivity loss due to
bandwidth smearing is quite acceptable, even for wideband instruments (a factor
2 loss for a typical 20% bandwidth experiment).

investigated in the presence of statistical queueing constraints. Queuing
constraints are imposed as limitations on buffer violation probabilities. The
performance under such constraints is captured through the effective capacity
formulation. A detailed analysis of the effective capacity is carried out in
the low-power, wideband, and high--signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. In the
low-power analysis, expressions for the first and second derivatives of the
effective capacity with respect to SNR at SNR= 0 are obtained under various
assumptions on the degree of channel state information at the transmitter.
Transmission strategies that are optimal in the sense of achieving the first
and second derivatives are identified. It is shown that while the first
derivative does not get affected by the presence of queueing constraints, the
second derivative gets smaller as the constraints become more stringent.
Through the energy efficiency analysis, this is shown to imply that the minimum
bit energy requirements do not change with more strict limitations but the
wideband slope diminishes. Similar results are obtained in the wideband regime
if rich multipath fading is being experienced. On the other hand, sparse
multipath fading with bounded number of degrees of freedom is shown to increase
the minimum bit energy requirements in the presence of queueing constraints.
Following the low-SNR study, the impact of buffer limitations on the high-SNR
performance is quantified by analyzing the high-SNR slope and the power offset
in Rayleigh fading channels. Finally, numerical results are provided to
illustrate the theoretical findings.

reaction proceeds via an intranuclear cascade of nucleon-nucleon collisions
followed by evaporation of particles from an equilibrated, heavy target
residuum. The shape of the excitation functions was well described by model
calculations for all reaction products. The magnitude of the cross sections was
reasonably well reproduced for heavy reaction products, i.e. for nuclei heavier
than Al, but the cross sections for lighter products were systematically
underestimated. This fact was used as an argument in favor of a significant
break-up contribution to the reaction mechanism. The present conclusions are
supported by recently published results of investigations of differential cross
sections in p+Ni collisions, which showed that hypothesis of the break-up of

the statistics of cosmological structure are explored by constructing a
non-Gaussian probability distribution function (PDF). Such PDF is derived for
the comoving curvature perturbation from first principles in the context of
quantum field theory, with n-point correlation functions as the only input. The
non-Gaussian PDF is then used to explore two important problems in the physics
of primordial black holes (PBHs): First, to compute non-Gaussian corrections to
the number of PBHs generated from the primordial curvature fluctuations. The
second application concerns new cosmological observables. The formation of PBHs
is known to depend on two main physical characteristics: the strength of the
gravitational field produced by the initial curvature inhomogeneity and the
pressure gradient at the edge of the curvature configuration. We account for
the probability of finding these configurations by using two parameters: The
amplitude of the inhomogeneity and its second radial derivative, evaluated at
the centre of the configuration. The implications of the derived probability
for the fraction of mass in the universe in the form of PBHs are discussed.

at 118 (M/10Msol)^-1 Hz found in each of the three analyzed fluid variables.
The three dimensional density structure at this frequency suggests that the
power is a composite oscillation whose dominant components are an over dense
clump corotating with the background flow, a low order inertial wave, and a low
order inertial-acoustic wave. Our results provide preliminary confirmation of
earlier suggestions that disk tilt can be an important excitation mechanism for
inertial waves.

principle. The background evolution can be effectively modelled by either a
scalar field or by a barotropic fluid.The fluid model can be used to emulate
perturbations in a scalar field model of dark energy, though this model breaks
down at large scales. In this paper we study evolution of dark energy
perturbations in canonical scalar field models: the classes of thawing and
freezing models.The dark energy equation of state evolves differently in these
classes.In freezing models, the equation of state deviates from that of a
cosmological constant at early times.For thawing models, the dark energy
equation of state remains near that of the cosmological constant at early times
and begins to deviate from it only at late times.Since the dark energy equation
of state evolves differently in these classes,the dark energy perturbations too
evolve differently. In freezing models, since the equation of state deviates
from that of a cosmological constant at early times, there is a significant
difference in evolution of matter perturbations from those in the cosmological
constant model.In comparison, matter perturbations in thawing models differ
from the cosmological constant only at late times. This difference provides an
additional handle to distinguish between these classes of models and this
difference should manifest itself in the ISW effect.

conformal diffeomorphisms of $\s^n$ is denoted by $M (n)$. Let $M_o (n)$ be its
identity component which consists of all orientation-preserving elements in $M

conjugacy of $T$ and $T^{-1}$ in $M_o (n)$. For an element $T$ in $M (n)$, $T$
and $T^{-1}$ are conjugate in $M (n)$, but they may not be conjugate in $M_o

$T^{-1}$. In this paper we classify real elements in $M_o (n)$.
  Let $T$ be an element in $M_o(n)$. Corresponding to $T$ there is an
associated element $T_o$ in $SO(n+1)$. If the complex conjugate eigenvalues of
$T_o$ are given by $\{e^{i\theta_j}, e^{-i\theta_j}\}$, $0 < \theta_j \leq

\emph{rotation angles} of $T$. If the rotation angles of $T$ are distinct from
each-other, then $T$ is called a \emph{regular} element. After classifying the
real elements in $M_o (n)$ we have parametrized the conjugacy classes of
regular elements in $M_o (n)$. In the parametrization, when $T$ is not
conjugate to $T^{-1}$, we have enlarged the group and have considered the
conjugacy class of $T$ in $M (n)$. We prove that each such conjugacy class can

halogen-containing molecules are of special interest because of their unique
thermochemistry. Here, we present a theoretical study of the chemistry of

We have modeled both diffuse and dense molecular clouds, making use of updated
estimates for the rates of several key chemical processes. We present
predictions for the abundances of the three halogen molecules that have been
detected to date in the interstellar medium: HF, CF+ and HCl. As in our
previous study of fluorine-bearing interstellar molecules, we predict HF to be
the dominant gas-phase reservoir of fluorine within both diffuse and dense
molecular clouds; we expect the Herschel Space Observatory to detect widespread
absorption in the HF J=1-0 transition. Our updated model now overpredicts the
CF+ abundance by a factor ~10 relative to observations of the Orion Bar; this
discrepancy has widened because we now adopt a laboratory measurement of the
CF+ dissociative recombination rate that is smaller than the estimate we
adopted previously. This disagreement suggests that the reaction of C+ with HF
proceeds more slowly than the capture rate assumed in our model; a laboratory
measurement of this reaction rate would be very desirable. Our model predicts
diffuse cloud HCl abundances that are similar to those predicted previously and
detected tentatively toward zeta Oph. Two additional species are potentially
detectable from photodissociation regions: the H2Cl+ and HCl+ molecular ions.
Ortho-H2Cl+ has its lowest-lying transition in the millimeter spectral region
observable from the ground, and the lowest rotational transition of HCl+ is
